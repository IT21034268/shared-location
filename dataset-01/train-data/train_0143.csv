4,A well-acted twisting thriller,"Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery) is an art thief who hides himself away in his Scottish castle. But an art insurance investigator, Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is now on his trail. She seemingly aids him in one last major theft - this time of a priceless Chinese mask - with a view to catching him in the act. Virginia manages to slip away and tell her boss, Hector Cruz (Will Patton) all about the plans; but MacDougal has the place bugged so he knows all about the double-cross. After the duo successfully complete this theft, Virginia persuades MacDougal to go for a bank robbery from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, just as the world is poised to enter the new millennium in 2000. The dialogue is witty and engaging, and the possibility of romance between the antagonists adds another dimension to the story line. There are further twists in this exciting story, but I shall say no more. Connery and Zeta-Jones play their parts convincingly."
4,4 1/2 stars overall,"Overall this movie is really good. Its fun and enjoyable and it had great acting. Like most movies, it hgad flaws but since it was fun its easily overlooked. I think its a great movie to own and would recommend this movie to anyone."
3,A Tired Looking Sean Connery,"Sean Connery is Robert MacDougal, art thief extraordinaire. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Virginia Baker, insurance investigator out to get her man. It is always good to see Sean Connery but he and Zeta-Jones have very little to no chemistry as a team if that was what they were intended to be in a very tired plot line. The film starts off well but their chemistry or relationship is rather strange if one even cares about that aspect. Caper films such as this have been done much better. The preparation scenes for the caper are a bore and look pretty unprofessional for characters who are supposed to be in this line of work. What this film needed was a good director and a good editor as well. The film has a few good scenes thanks to Connery, but the film never reaches its potential. Norman Garwood's Production Designs help a bit while Christopher Young's score is perfunctory. In truth this is a very tired looking production as is Connery's expression throughout."
2,"A bad imitation of the ""Thomas Crown affair""","Ok, so this movie is mildly entertaining. After all, Zeta-Jones' body clad in skin-tight garments is certainly a sight worth beholding. However, that's pretty much all this movie can sport: the story is weak and not very original (the ""Thomas Crown affair"" is the real thing and a much better movie overall) and the characters are not convinced about their roles (neither are we). It is not the worst movie I've ever seen but it could be better. Go for the other title (The ""TC affair"") if you haven't seen it already and enjoy!"
3,Not recommended for inflight entertainment!,"I saw this movie whilst flying across Europe so that could be why it didn't grip me, but there is something about a 60+ year old man kissing a woman half his age that makes my stomach turn. Sean Connery as always is in top form, back to his 007 days, but this film lacks the fast paced action we'd come to associate with Connery in his Bond days. The plot is slow and too static, the movie tends to stick in one location (an old house in the middle of nowhere) while Connery and Zeta play cat-and-mouse games of betrayal. There are a few good moments, not knowing who is the bad guy (or girl) in this movie makes it a little more exciting, but the big question is WHY? The plot centres around some sort of conspiracy but WHY? A little too slow, an old Bond movie is always more fun and more exciting. Rent, watch once then send it back!"
3,This was an o.k movie,"This movie was actually kind of confusing to me. I think that there should of been a good chase scene. what is a suspense with out a chase scene. The people did too much talking and not enough action. Also did anyone else notice that Catherine Zeta-Jones had about 7 different hairstyles and 10 different outfits. Are we acting here or putting on a fashion show? You tell me. Also Sean Connery doesn't look good for his age. Stop making him younger than he is. The movie has it's good parts when they had to seal the mask and when they had to cross to the next buliding while hanging on for their lives. However, I didn't leave the movie theatre like that was good. when it was over I was just like o.k. I think it needed something more."
3,An average film that needs improving.,"Fearless insurance investigator Gin Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is given the chance to bring the world's most legendary art thief, ""Mac"" MacDougal (Sean Connery) to the bottom. He proves more elusive than expected, but finally Gin believes she has the confidence. She needs to be extremely sure, however, as together they plan the heist of the millennium from the sickening height of one of the tallest buildings in the world....Entrapment is an average movie that is entertaining enough, but it needs ultimate improving. Still, the story is intriguing and the acting is good which make this film definitely not as bad as all the critics promise it is."
2,Expect more from Sean Connolly,"I like Sean a lot. I think this movie seems to lower his acting credentials if compared to his other movies. Also, I don't like the female lead actress. She is horrible. I just can not read from her acting but what she reallys feel. Plus, the movie has thousands of twists. Altogether with her lousy action, it makes me confused so many times. Anyway, I give 2 stars because I expect more from Sean. But, there is nothing to lose to watch this movie"
3,fun but shallow,"This movie is a lot of fun to watch, with the dares and the snares and the excitement and of course Ms Zeta-Jones' lovely physique. I don't mind about the budding romance between Catherine and Connery, for even given a large age difference, two people engaged in such an intense project together would end up feeling some physical attraction. Still, much of what happens strains credulity even for film-goers. And what happened to all the other people? Would the FBI leave the platform so quickly? And the other passengers not come back? And even if Connery likes his privacy, is he really doing all the dusting in that vast castle by himself? Who is doing the cooking?"
3,"Once upon a time, in a millennium not long ago...","In the weeks leading up to January 1st, 2000, most people were thinking about Y2K and a millennium bug that never took place. Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery were stealing masks and robbing banks. Or, at least, their characters in Entrapment were.Zeta-Jones stars in this film as an investigator for an insurance company. After a priceless Rembrandt goes missing, she offers to go after Mack (Connery) using a famous Chinese mask as bait. The two get tangled up in a web of lies and stealth as they then plot to perform a milti-billion-dollar heist in Kuala Lumpur.The action here is mediocre at best; the twists and turns that this movie have to offer are forseeable. Its a story line which easily gets lost. It is just another movie which caters to all the Millennium hype of 1999. If not for the acting of Connery and Zeta-Jones, this movie would be easily forgettable. However, I've seen both stars do much better work than this."
4,good but not anamorphic,"I bought this movie because I heard it was really good (it is), in addition to which AMAZON stated it was in anamorphic format. When I received it I noticed it was in letterbox format, which made me very upset.Nevertheless it is very good.It contains no graphic language and Sean Connery plays his role very well (which I expected) as a master thief.I recomend (ignor the letterbox format)"
2,Great Movie. Bluray was a let down. Buy DVD instead.,Buy DVD and save money. BluRay resolution is nothing to write about. Better off with a DVD.
4,A pleasant surprise.,"I had not expected much from this movie, but I ended up liking it very much. While not terribly believable, the plot does not have any major holes in it. It was not entirely original, I recognised several scenes from movies like ""the Setup"" and the Thomas Crown Affair. On the other hand, nothing was completely copied end the plot held enough twists to be interesting. The actor did an admirable job, rather better then most action movies. The one difficulty I have with the whole movie is the part played by Connery. While he is still in fysically good shape, it is obvious he is no longer capable of the acrobatics that he is supposed to perform. This however is a minor point."
3,I've seen better,"Connery and Jones make for a terrible match-up. She is unbelievable in her role, but he is perfect in his. Connery never fails to deliver even when matched with inferior actors/actresses. The plot - needed some work. I actually fell asleep near the end. I lost interest in the film as it was coming to those crucial plot ending explanations where the audience is filled in on the whole shebang. If we must give actors money - at least make the film believable."
4,Special Edition disappointing,"1st, I just want to say that I really enjoyed this movie. but I feel like I have to warn people that want the special edition dvd, it's not that great. I wanted it for the deleted scense and the alternate ending, well, they stink. there is no talking in these scenes, just sound effects. so you have no idea what is really going on or what they are saying, unless you can read lips. the ending is pretty stupid too, plus, no speaking, so who knows if it could have been better. the director's commentary can be interesting and the trailers and 'making of' are good to watch, but I was really looking forward to the extra footage and am tremendously disappointed. but the movie is pretty good if you haven't seen it. but it's not worth it to do what i did and buy another copy if you already have one."
5,"May-Winter Romance, Nail-biting Suspense, Great Talents","I have seen this film several times and never tire of it. Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones have great chemistry, which develops while she (a seductive insurance investigator) attempts to entrap Connery, a master thief. Instead the two join forces for a hair-raising, multibillion dollar heist at the new millenium."
4,one of my fartotive sean connery movies,entrapment was one of sean connery best movies he is a master art theif and cathrine zetra jones plays gin the fbi agents when a rembrants was stolen before the new minelliuam the evdients points to sean connerychasrteters so sit back whan watch this fast placed movies it is worth the rented especially the parts about theifs and bllackmail
4,But its not an anamorphic transfer,"FYI ""Entrapment is a superb letterbox transfer, but is not 16:9 enhanced aka anamorphic."
1,the worst film of 1999,"i can't believe all the positive reviews people have written, possibly the original producers of the movie. besides the fact that zeta-jones is the worst actress i have ever seen, not to mention a low-class welsh beauty whose fame has faded away already, the plot is predictable and ridiculous. the scene where we have to watch her walking thru the laser security was excruciatingly boring, in the meantime old connery is drolling on himself and groaning. not to mention the ending where they end up together, my god, it was unbelieveably bad. i'm a big james bond fan and wanted to like this movie, but it really insulted my intelligence. please save yourself time and money and skip this one."
1,"Bad movie, hot girl.","The only redeeming qualities of this movie is Catherine Zeta Jones' stunning face/body and some nice scenery. The scenes of the heist in Kuala Lampur as well as the Scottish castle scenes had some incredibly picturesque backgrounds. However, the plot is convoluted to the point where the ""tense"" moments lack suspense because the viewer is too confused to figure out what is going on. The director attempts to bombard the audience with plot twists but there are too many twists and turns that don't really seem to make any sense. The age difference between Connery and Jones detracts from the believability of their romance. If you're looking for a movie about a heist, go with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the Thomas Crown Affair."
4,Impossible but Doable!,"The Actors have done a great job; Well, what do you expect from Sean Connery! Catherine Zeta Jones is very sexy and makes a feast for my eyes! The only thing is about this DVD version that there were no special features except the trailer..."
1,"A movie I wanted to like, but...","So this is what James Bond does when he comes out of retirement? This is a flick I couldn't get into, even in dvd format. Looking more like a father and daughter, Connery and Zeta-Jones never generate the electricity that say, Brosnon and Russo have in Thomas Crown Affair. I agree with another reader that the stars were miscast. Jones never really gets into character, probably too concious of wanting to look perfect every time she's in a scene. I'm a Connery fan, but the old dog has just simply run out of tricks. We've seen them all. Yes, the theft and the finalé may be worth the price of a rental, but don't buy this, unless you enjoy seeing a 60-some year old man running around with a woman half his age. Ring a bell? (Nicholson and Hunt in As Good As It Gets-what was the attraction there?)"
4,Good! Tense,"This movie, was very unpredictable. That's what I mostly enjoyed about it! The acting was great. Two great actors(Sean Connery and Cathrine Zeta-Jones) did a great job in this movie. There like good guy-bad guys! There bad guys that you like. The action is great, the plot line is good! I still haven't told you much about the movie either than it's good! Well, their both stealers, who steal a bunch of stuff. The last is 8 billion dollars, at a world's largest bank. That was the best part of the movie. Alot of one line humours type of thing! I consider this to be one of my all time favourite movies, two thumbs up!!!"
2,a rather boring movie,"This movie tries to squeeze mileage out of Connery's charm, Zeta-Jones' sexiness. However neither of them could do much to overcome the plot's clunkiness. The heist job in the middle of the movie lacks action and suspense (the Zeta-Jones moves have been shown too much earlier - even in the movie trailer, yielding no new ""insight"" to her ""talents"".) The ""entrapment"" makes no sense whatever given the ending. A movie for Connery or Zeta-Jones fans only."
1,Terrible Chemistry,"Even though Sean is a man's man, you still have a hard time believing that these 2 will ever hook up. You are constantly afraid that these 2 will be involved in a love scene. Separately, say Sean and Money Penny and Catherine and Antonio Banderas, okay; together no thanks!"
1,Unbelievably bad,"You'd think that Sean Connery could pick and choose, and that he'd choose better than this. Put simply, it's the most boring, uninteresting film I've seen in a long time. A very long time.Avoid this at any cost!"
1,don't buy it,this movie is trash the best scene in it is the one where Catherine Zeta Jones is training for the lasers
5,entrapment,"i have not yet seen the complete dvd, but i have seen the trailer in a movie house and i would like to purchase the dvd thank you ps from what i have seen in the trailer it looks like a very exciting movie."
5,Good summer read!,I really liked this book. It was an easy read and good for reading at the pool or the beach!
4,Good Comfort book,If your looking for entertainment without the emotional roller coaster then this is the book. If you have 8 hours to curl up and read a fiction book and not be stressed and want to close the book and feel good like when you finsh from a relaxing day at the spa then read this book.
1,Waste of Money,"I'd honestly give this half a star if it was available. My apologies to the author, but personally I just wasn't into this book. It's one of the first ones I've read where I couldn't wait to finish. And I didn't even finish it before giving up (I was halfway through). After awhile I got tired of Tyler seeming like any other guy out there that just wants one thing from a girl, but then also acts like he really cares for Kate and wants to make a home where she is. And the fact that they go on... and on.... and on... about the 'secret' that the family is keeping from the world that happened that one summer but not telling us what it is, was getting old. They could have cut the story in half, told us the secret, and be done with it. At this point I don't even care what secret the family is holding in, I'm deleting this book from my Kindle and moving onto better books (the more expensive books are better and worth every penny!)."
2,It dragggggged,"This could have been interesting, but it just dragged on and on. The parts of the story that could have been excitig---the sailing race and huge storm, were told in snippets or not really at all. The main characters were flat and kind of dull stereotypes. The drunken father they supported and lied for despite the fact that he pretty much tried to ruin their lives and had a tendency to try and get the men they love killed was way too over the top.The ending was predictable and tied up too quickly. Perhaps the author could have spent more on the ""before"" and the ending instead of stretching the middle in such a long boring manner. This was NOT a mystery/suspense, but rather a romance with ""secrets"" told in a very predictable manner. There were some inconsistencies that made it hard to appreciate where the story was going, and the poor editing was distracting."
1,Most disappointing,"I found this story to be implausible on many levels. It's hard to imagine that a seemingly smart, strong, and savy woman with a secret, that if revealed, would devastate her family, would allow herself to become involved with a reporter determined to uncover the truth, just because he was so good looking. I don't want to say what else I found hard to believe, because to do so would give away too much of the plot. Suffice it to say that the ending was not plausible."
1,"plot ""stuck in the doldrums""","Started out with some degree of interest and suspense, but halfway through seemed to be stuck going nowhere. Too dull. Abandoned ship. [Pun intended for the sailing storyline.]"
2,Up and Down and Not Good,"Skip this book, please. I don't know how it is on any top 100 list, but don't let that fool you."
2,Summer letdown,"I wanted to love this book. I have read other books by Barbara Freethy which were moving and exciting page turners. But Summer Secrets did nothing but fizzle my hopes for a good summer read. A bunch of middle age former high school BFFS, and an entitled spoiled teenager take off on an yacht adventure. Anything that could go wrong does. It wouldn't be a tale at sea without the unbelievable clash with pirates. I would have found the book more enjoyable if all of the characters were kidnapped and lost at sea. It was no summer picnic getting through this novel. It is way too predictable and boring."
1,Seriously?,"This book was cheap and had good reviews and high stars for a summer read. I am sorry but it was so poorly written, predictable and honestly, it was just stupid--even for a summer beach bag read. The author aged herself by poorly capturing her young characters. Eye rolling over the sexual angst that once again makes the author seem to be a generation or two behind the time. Will be more careful when buying books based on amazon reviews. Not worth the time or money."
2,a romaance novel,"I do not like nor read romance novels. I bought this, and read it, but this is not my favourite. It is a romance novel, with everything that genre implies."
5,Summer Secrets,"This book had me riveted to my Kindle. I could NOT stop reading it. Loved the storyline, characters.Barb keep writing good books and I will keep reading them. I am downloading everything she writes."
3,Summer something..,"First time reading a Freethy novel. Story line is interesting enough and the biggest secrets stayed unrevealed until near the end. Reminiscent of the old ""Love Boat"" shows where people fell in love and even got engaged on a 1 week cruise, two main characters ""fall in love"" and have on-the-page sexual encounters but ""don't know each other well enough"" to talk about marriage! Um. Ok. For those who care: a smattering of 4 letter words and at least one use of Jesus's name as a swear word."
4,Summer Secrets Barbara Freethy,"I enjoyed this book as a lighter read than I would normally would. I have not read this author before, but thankyou for suggestong her. I have also read her Golden Lies, a very similar light entertaining story with love and mystery, great tale."
4,Great Read,This is the 2nd Barbara Freethy book I read. I completely enjoyed it. I will say the 1st book I read by her was a book I bought by mistake. I was looking to buy a Barbara Delinsky book. I didn't pay attention to the last name I just picked it up. I'm so glad I did because now I have a new author to read. I've made a list of all her books to put on my knidle. My Spring Break will be spent reading them.
1,Horrible. I want my money back!,"Rarely have I looked forward to finishing a book. I should have stopped reading it in the first 50 pages. I thought maybe there would be an intelligent plot twist somewhere along the way, but this book reads like a Harlequin romance without the sex scenes. My apologies to the author and to the fan base, but if you are not a reader of sugar-sweet romance novels, do not buy this book.I would have given the book two stars were it not for the horrific editing. These were not small typos that the experienced reader stumbles over and then keeps reading. These were jarring errors that forced the reader to go back and re-read the last few sentences before the error, in order to decode the meaning. The author should ask for money back from the editor, if there was one."
4,wonderful read,"Barbara Freethy, This was my first book by you, but I assure you it will not be my last!I did lose a bit of sleep because of it, but it was worth it. I found there were times Ijust couldn't put it down - just the kind of a book that I like. Lots of twists and turns!Thank you and blessingsFran Combs"
5,great read,Barbara Freethy likes to write around the summer months andthis book is no exception. Looking forward to more books fromher
3,needs editing,"This may not be important to most, but to me it is. The only complaint I have about this book (and most of the other Kindle ebooks I have purchased) is that there seems to be a lack of editing before they are published. The story line is great, this is the first of Freethy's work that I have read, but I do intend to buy more, I just hope the next don't have so many spelling and grammatical errors."
2,Bad characterization and very stilted dialog,This is the first book I am reading of this author. The writing felt very amateurish and I really cant believe that this book has such high ratings here. I wish I could get my money back!
5,Great summer read!,"What a wonderful romantic adventure and great summer read! It was well written with interesting characters that I really cared about, a fast paced plot that kept me guessing to the last page, and some heartwarming moments as well. I highly recommend this one."
2,summer secrets,I also could not wait to be done with this book. It was cheesy and boring and seemed to go on and on going no where. I forced myself to finish it since I paid good money for it.
2,"Quick, brainless read","I bought this book on my Kindle because the reviews said it was fast-moving and suspenseful - and it did not disappoint there. However, I would never have finished this book if there was not a ""summer secret"" to discover. The editing was terrible, the circumstances were unbelievable, the language was elementary, and the character development was amateurish. There were many twists and turns, which Freethy even pointed out in a sentence that read along the lines of ""even Tyler could not believe this unexpected twist""... not exactly a sophisticated writing style. I could have easily read this book in 4th grade and understood it - not my idea of a good novel. However, if you want a mindless read or care more about entertainment than quality, go for it."
2,Stopped reading after 75 pages,"I generally like any kind of book, including chick-lit or romance on occassion. This one I couldn't wait to put down. I thought it was really boring with an obvious story line. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's unfamiliar with this author."
4,A great book for those learning actionscript,"I really enjoyed this book. It goes in depth in covering the actionscript language for Flash 8, and starts off at a relatively slow pace so you don't feel overwhelmed. My only complaint is that it relies a lot (at least in the beginning) on using the script assist mode which I think is a waste of time for those trying to LEARN actionscript. In it's defense, the book weans you off it as it goes along, and I can see someone with no actionscript experience finding that extremely helpful. Knowing a decent amount of actionscript before reading this, I found it a bit annoying but like I said, it fades out of that as the book goes on. Great for learning the newer way to code, and gives a good basis to really use Macromedia Flash to it's full potential."
4,A bit disappointed but an excellent record.,"I thought this DVD was going to give some insight on strategy and execution for situations varied. All it turned out to be were some Kata and some history on the subject. That's good and all and don't get me wrong I'm going to keep the DVD because it is a very good depiction of all the kata I once knew but I thought it was going to be more that that. I guess I had my taste buds set on Chilly Dogs and I got a Hamburger, both are valid but I wanted Chilly Dogs. The video is grade ""A"" but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be from the advertisement. For those of you who need this information, the Kata on this DVD are ""Passai, Chinto, Kusanku, Ananku, Wanshu, Gojushiho and Wanchin. Like I said, the quality of the video is excellent but kata are all you get."
4,Good movie to get you in the mood for some summer hoops.,"* To the person from Tennesee: What made you think this would be a good movie for young basketball loving children? That's why it is rated R, so kids won't see it!!"
4,It's a classic.,"I seen this movie years ago and wanted to add it to my collection. Now this is what I like to see, two different race becoming friends."
4,Great Movie And Descent DVD Features,"Let's Start With The Movie Itself, The Whole Idea For The Movie To Me Seems Kinda Dull And Boring But Surprisingly This Movie Is Anything But That. Starring One Of The Greatest Actors Of All Time In Wesley Snipes This Movie Keeps You Hooked. This Is By Far My Favorite Sport Movie And Ranks At The Top Of My List Of Favorite Movies In General. It Has Plenty Of Basketball Action And Has A Great Story Line And Plot. As For The DVD, It Has Some Cool Features As Well, My Favorite Is The Music Video Were Alot Of The Stars In The Movie Make Themself Look Stupid....lol...The Movie Is A Must See Rather On VHS Or DVD But This Is A Great Addition To Any DVD Collection....."
1,Yuk!,"Do not get this movie for your young, basketball loving children, unless you want to be wowed by the new words they are going to learn. Hollywood can do better than this. The only thing good are the court moves."
3,if goria didn't want da $$$$ y did she leave billy in da 1st place,"this was a good movie goria was very spoiled and took advantage of billy ""woody harrison"" he was hustling all day 2 put food on da table and when he comes home his girlfriend says how much $ did u make instead of i miss u she left him at least 3 times n da movie and when she comes back it is for money after billy and snidy win some $ from da basketball contests i would have given this money a higher score if goria would have understand goria because she took things 2 far i no she was kind of smart of winning da game show on jeopardy but she still of have there until the end of da movie Joe Brown"
2,average,"Most of the court action looked fake.the hustle of the Loot was cool.but this film was two movies in one.Woody had his thing&Wesley was doing his.Rosie Perez? i didn't get her role at all.the film tries to hard to appeal to everyone. it should have stuck to the Hustle.a so-so buddy,buddy movie."
2,Leave this one alone,"I am a Celibidache-ophile, especially when it comes to Bruckner and Tchaikovsky, but please leave this one alone, ie. out of your collection. It is lethargic and quite frankly, BORING. I deleted it from my collection after a few hearings, which didn't help any to change my mind. Otherwise, i have retained every other Celibidache EMI CLASSICS recording I can lay my hands on from Amazon or other sources. But this one is a loser, even if it is cheap [but for good reason].AMS in Boise"
1,Celibidache at his worst,"Anyone who is interested in this recording most probably is well acquainted with Celi's extremely lugubrious tempo and murky tone. His peculiar style works in the interpretation of Bruckner, Tchaikovsky, and perhaps some of Brahms' works. But Haydn? Combine his extremely slow tempo and gloomy tone in the interpretation of Haydn, and then the youthful freshness, vitality, and clarity of Haydn are all vanished away. What you get is Requiem of Haydn which he never wrote. Don't spend a single penny for this recording. Listen Collin Davis or Eugen Jochum. By far they are the best interpreters of Haydn's symphonies in general, 'Drumroll' in particular."
4,Fair & Honest Review,"I feel some of the other reviews were a too harsh. I first read the book at Borders and really liked it :) Obviously no book or video compares to time spent in the water but I found the book to be very good and informative. Most ""learn to surf"" books always seem to contain the same basic info (paddling, popping-up, duck-diving) but this book goes far beyond and can be appreciated by the advancing-beginner & intermediate surfers looking to improve. I'm hoping to teach a surfing class at the college I work for & would seriously consider recommending this book for any surfing students. The other book I really liked was Taj Burrow's Book of Surfing but I believe is for more advanced surfers and contains too much surf jargon & slang for the beginners."
1,"Surfing and skiing are they the same, no way.","After surfing for over 15 years no book can really teach you how to surf. Skiing is far from surfing, in fact a swim coach would probably have a better idea of how to condition for surfing. I would say put down your cash for some surf wax and get out, there is no need to buy this book. Seems like the author trying to cash in on surfing and can he surf, maybe but not very many years in the water."
2,phlegmatic and didactic,"I'm a big fan of Celibidache's live recordings from the 1960's with the Italian orchestras from rome and milan, etc. but what we have in these late EMI releases that I've heard is possibly an example of ideology clouding judgement. Particularly in Tchaikovsky where rhythm and color are essential aspects of the Russian melos, this approach just won't wash. Anyone familiar with Russian style from the early conductors, Golavanov, Dubrowen, or pianists like Rachmaninoff, whose lineage to Tchaikovsky cannot be seriously questioned, will likely find this performance of the Tchaikovsky 5th deeply unsatisfying. It is not only phlegmatic and colorless, but sounds like the conducting of a provincial kapellmeister. The concept that music must be slow enough to hear all the elements is theoretically true, but this is positively sclerotic. Sorry. For modern versions, try Mravinsky naturally, and Horenstein if you can find it."
4,Classic Film Score,"This collects most of the best soundtrack songs from the films Rocky I to IV. My only complaint is that Hearts on Fire from Rocky IV is not on this album. The first Rocky won Best Picture in 1972. Album highlights are: Burning Heart, Living in America, Eye of the Tiger, No Easy Way Out, Gonna Fly Now and Going the Distance."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PERSON!!!,"I was very disappointed when I went to play this DVD and realized it was a bootleg. The quality is horrible and the picture size of the film only shows up as a 12 by 12 square on your screen. Not quite sure how people get away selling these, because it is completely illegal and they should be prosecuted. Do Not Buy movies from them. ! A complete waste of money!"
4,A great follow up to a family classic,Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is more of the same from the first film. Culkin respires his role and does a good job at it and the chemistry between Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci is still great. Rob Schinder and Timmy Curry provide good supporting roles in this fun sequel
5,Great Movie,It's a funny and family movie. We enjoyed it very much and we can continue watching it many many times that we don`t get bored. My children laughed a lot and the best thing is that they always want to watch movies with us.
3,Would have been cute,"Would have been cute if I hadn't seen the first one. Why? Because they're just too similar. Similar plot, same bad guys, similar touching scene at the climax of the movie. Done well, though."
5,Great Movie that most have seen!,This is a great movie we always enjoy watching as a family each year between Christmas and New Years. Many laughs!
3,the video transmission was unclear at times,the video transmission was unclear at times and broke up. We sometimes had to wait for the streaming to catch up.
5,Home Alone 2,"My favorite out of the Home Alone series. In fact, never had the desire to watch 3 or 4. Number one was good also, but love the second one a bit more. Excellent for Christmas time. DVD was sent quickly and in good condition."
4,great,awesome !! i love it To great for words to complete this required little cool review it was good thanks
3,Review of product,Great item fast shipping. Though i was disappointed to find that this is not actually in widescreen format. Its in letterbox format so the it doesnt take up the whole screen. Too bad- though i still love this movie
2,Bad HD copy,"I bought Home Alone and Home Alone 2 at the same time and the same place. Home Alone is a great Blu-ray movie. Home Alone 2 is a bad copy of a DVD original. Grainy, sounds a little hollow or having a slight echo. No extra materials whatsoever, so you get the movie and that's it. The DVD in widescreen format is as good or better than this Blu-ray. However, highly recommend Home Alone on Blu-ray."
3,It was an ok movie,"I liked the other Home alone but this was not that great. A bit boring movie, movie quality was good though.."
1,Amazon kept return of faulty item and never replaced it or gave credit.,"I purchased ""Home Alone 2"" dirctly from Amazon, however it had no sound. I returned it and never received a replacement item or refund from Amazon. I tracked it and received a receit that Amazon received it. Unfortunately I see no phone # or email listed to contact Amazon about this problem."
2,still stupid and retarted,"ok, home alone sucks. Why do they keep on making this crap?! the only movie that is actually good is Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House. But i dont watch it because everyone thinks itHA4's stupid too. So dont buy this. Its so stupid with all of the stupid storylines, script, action, and crime. 20th Century Fox, please stop making Home Alone movies and make more PG13/R movies every second while you're at it!-- Actually, it's all a lie. This movie does not really suck."
1,Never received the item.,I did not receive this item... and my little boys were quite disappointed!!!!! :(
1,Really??,"After reading all the rave reviews, I figured my children would enjoy this movie - after all, they thought HA3 was hysterical. We were so surprised to find that HA2 was just plain weird! The kids were bored, and creeped out by the NYC scenes (they are 7 & 9). We did not finish watching it. Give me the original any day!"
1,"DULL PREDICTABLE, NOTHING NEW","Mildly entertaining, starring a little brat who has obviously been badly brought up. This film promotes violence, I personally think that making a joke about bricks being chucked at someone's head from a great height is terrible. It is a bad film and unsuitable for kids. However, if easy on the brain mindless empty entertainment is your thing, you could watch worse. P"
3,"Home Alone 2 ""Lost In New York""","I just want to clear something up real quick, they change from the Wet Bandits to the Sticky Bandits in the front when Marv puts tape on his fingers and dips his hand into a giving plate and takes the money. This one is a little different than the first, because Kevin loses himself trying to find batteries. He gets on the wrong plane thinking he sees his father when its actually not. He ends up in New York, and what a coincidence so do robbers Marv and Harry, who tried to rob his house once before when Kevin was alone and tried to stop it. Havoc breaks lose when they meet up with each other and Kevin sets boobie traps in his Uncle Rob who is out of towns home. Hillarious."
3,"A little better than the first, but not a lot.","Kevin boarding the wrong plane (hey, it could happen), Kevin and the burglars he busted last year in New York City at the same time (maybe a coincedince), a power outage every night before this family goes on vacation (tradition?), and Keven being 8 in the first movie and this movie takes place a year later and he's 10 (now that's unbelievable!). Other than that this is still a pretty funny movie, especialy the part where those hotel clerks are after him and he makes them think there's a mobster in the room (""Get down on your knees and tell me you love me!""). The boobi-trap ending was pretty much the same as the first, but unlike the first, most of the jokes in this one never get old!"
3,"Good product, bad price","I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift last year. The product was great, but the price was pretty high for a used DVD. Wish I had looked around a little more for a better price."
4,Great movie!,This is a classic movie. Every 6 yr old and older will love it! A must have for the Christmas season.
2,Scratched movie,Video was wrapped and advertised that it was new yet it was scratched and did not play well. Was very disappointed.
4,A Good Laugh,Rented this on Amazon for $2.99. Its been many years since I saw this video. Worth the money. Enjoyed a trip down memory lane and had many laughs.
4,A christmas movie sequel...,A good sequel to Home Alone. How do they keep leaving this kid? Full of funny antics that leave you laughing. It is a good thing that the bad guys from #1 made it to New York just in time to get some revenge while Kevin is there also! Cute movie I can recommend for all family members.
5,home alone,"I thought the movie was very fun.Because the boy is very very cute.Yes,it was.I learned family love.I would recommend this movie is very good.Because the movie makes me fun."
2,I hate this movie.,"Im not saying this is worse then ""Home Alone 4"" but I like Home Alone 1 & Home Alone 3 way over this movie. I love the acting by (Joe Pesci & Dainel Stern) thats just about it. Home Alone 1 is had a great story which Home Alone 2 it just was to off. ""Kevin is a huge beatiful house brining the pain to Harry and Merv while 2 same thing but more ugly."
2,Lousy rip-off of the first.,"Save your money. But if you do want to see it, see how amazed you are by the violence. Garbage."
3,3 of 5,"Home Alone 2 may as well be a remake. That's how close it follows in the footsteps of the original. It's a formula starting with the McCallister family going on Christmas vacation and ending with them celebrating elsewhere after reuniting with Kevin. This time he gets left at the airport, which sends the family to Miami and Kevin to New York City. He's alone again, if one can ever be alone in New York City, but he's not at home, so the title no longer makes sense.Once you realize you're basically watching Home Alone again; different details with the same basic plotline; you start to anticipate the one entertaining part; the part where The Wet Bandits, now known as The Sticky Bandits, fall victim to Kevin and his booby traps. Even though you know how everything's going to end-up, that climax does not disappoint. It's still fun to watch those two idiots become real-life Looney Tunes characters before your very eyes.marcellee.com"
5,efficient,The product was order on a Friday and at the doorstep on Tuesday. Great service and my grandchildren love the movie.
4,Another Christmas Favorite!!!,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved the 'Home Alone' series! This is a really good sequel! A year after Kevin stopped Harry and Marv, he gets on the wrong plane and heads to New York, while his family goes to Florida. Harry and Marv broke out of prison, and they happen to be in New York too. Kevin uses his dad's Credit Card to stay at the Plaza Hotel. When the staff scare him away, he tries to visit his relatives, but they are not home. Kevin runs into Harry and Marv who plan to rob a toy store where all the money will go to the Children's Hospital. Kevin sets up the traps again at his uncles' house and chaos ensues, and with the help of the 'bird lady' a showdown happens in Central Park. If you love the original, you'll love HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK!!!"
4,Christmas Classic,"This movie is great especially around Christmas time. It made me laugh as a kid, It makes me laugh now. It is slapstick comedy with some sappy moral scenes thrown in for the kids. I think its better than the first one because he gets to live every kids dream in the big apple. Watch the trailer for a basic plot idea."
4,It would get 5 stars if it didn't contain a few curse words,"This is indeed a classic, as the first one was.In this movie you're once again greeted to the characters from the first movie, as well as introduced to new characters.*Spoiler*The plot is a little different from the first one (this time he isn't protecting his own house, but protecting the money/toys that is to be given to a children's home/hospital), but it still has the same holiday charm."
4,Funnier but why more fake and unbelievable then the first,I like this film better then the first home alone in maney ways. I cant understand why home alone was a hugh hit it was good but not great. I found this one more funnier then the original but why more unbelievable. Ok let me start with the unbelievable part 1. He gets on a plane without his parents and saying he has his ticket 2. He meets the wet or now called the stickey bandits out of all new york city 3. The traps ok you would probobly die from some of the stuff he dose. After saying all those points I have to say it's a movie and a slap stick movie so it's supose to be fake. I found the traps way more funnier in this one and the bandits are funnier in this one.
4,Sent so quickly!,"Thank you for sending this so quickly, i got it for a christmas present and it got here way before I thought! Thanks again!"
5,Comedy Button,Watch this film with the Comedy Buttons livecast synced up to it for 2 of the funniest hours of your life.
5,drum major whistle,"Doesn't slip out of the drum major's mouth while conducting! Lightweight, yet powerful enough to be heard in the football stadium."
3,Okay,This product is very good. the weight distribution of the stick is decent.However my one complaint is that the tip of the stick is made out of wood and i feel that continuous usage will cause the tip to break off.
3,Different Than Usual,"i bought these sticks knowing Ralph Hardimon, so he recommended these, and i had tried this exact stick before, but for some reason the sticks that i received were different than all the other ralph hardimons i had used. They are the exact same stick, but the ones i got were extremely light and unbalanced. They were also way off pitch from each other."
3,"Read, but don't expect a masterpiece","This was an ok book. It had an interesting plot and idea. I would have given a five stars for the story, but I witheld the two points for the unbelieveability and cornyness. There is a part where it was unbereably stupid and corny. As for the unbelieveability, it is not so much the plot, but the way that one second they are getting shot at, and the next getting makeovers. Overall, this is a pretty good book, but it can be corny, stupid, and just bad a points."
3,Fast and Fun Start To A New Series,"Maximum Ride is the title of the book and also of the main character,a 14 year old girl with wings who along with other orphans like her must elude Erasers(men that are part wolf).The plot is simplistic,the concept not that orginal(X-Men have been tackling the same theme for years)but what makes it work is that it has a sense of humor and heart.With bite sized chapters about 3 pages each this book (Bad Pun Alert)literally flies by.Not a lot of questions are answered in the end but it's so much fun you'll look forward to continuing the journey with these characters in the sequel."
4,"quick, fun read","The Maximum Ride novels sat on our local public library's shelves, and never once did it ever cross my mind that I would enjoy them. Though juvenile, I found book 1 a fun read, quick and witty."
3,Quick escape reading,"If you like the easy sci-fantasy books that offer a quick escape feom the real world as long as you are willing to suspend your grip on reality, then this is a good book choice. I actually enjoyed this one. It is good for young readers and readers that are young at heart."
4,Max Ride,"Maximum Ride is another great book by James Patterson. The book flows well and it's easy become drawn into the plot. The characters are so real.Maximum Ride is Book 1 of a series, so be prepared to order more books once you have read this one, because the ending is not complete. The novel is about a group of children from ages 14 to 4 who look human, but who are also able to fly. Max is the main character in this novel. Max who is a 14-year-old half human, half bird is the leader of the pact. The story begins when the group go hunting for berries and Erasers (the bad guys who try to kill them) attach them, and kidnap Angel (4-year-old flock member who can read minds). After Angel is kidnapped the flock takes off on a journey to save her, whereby they begin to discover new abilities."
4,One that is hard to put down,"I really enjoyed this book and have purchased four books of the series and currently reading the second book. I was able to read this book in three sittings. It is a very easy ready and well written. I do believe this may have been geared toward teenagers and young adults (I am 45), but I am still enjoying it. I was glad I had the second book on hand when I finished the first one.I love James Patterson and the way he writes books. You really are engulfed in the story as it goes. I could picture the characters as I went along.It would be interesting if they ever made this series into a movie or mini-series. I would be sure to watch it."
5,awsome,"This book is by-far the best book i have ever read! I am looking forward to read the rest of the books in this series,and more by this auther."
5,Read it in 2 and a half hours,I woke up at 6 in the morning to finish the book. I could not put this down! The only flaw was the way the author cramed two books into one...Minor spoilers start here (they end)I personally think the plotline about Angel being kidnapped should have been its own book. Then the rest about their journey in New York would also be a seperate book.Minor spoilers end hereNone of this effected my enjoyment of the book though! A must read!
4,Pretty good read,I thought this was a good read. It is just the beginning really of the whole plot and you are left hanging so you'll have to read the rest.
5,amazing book !!!!!!!!!!,Maximum comes from the School. Max and her flock are continually chased by Erasers. when Angel is taken back to the School Max and the rest of the flock race against time to save her.
3,Just okay,I was expecting a lot better considering who the author is. The book for me was just okay. It reminding me a lot of the tv seris Dark Angel...so not too original. But good book.
3,"Great Idea, Little Substance","The Angel Experiment is quite good, and very entertaining. Max is a character that is easy to like, the humor isn't too stressed, and the novelty of kids with wings is interesting.Also, this particular book has good direction; right away there is a clear goal that needs to be accomplished, and while later in the book the kids just fly around New York for a while, the beginning really helps to hold the rest together.The first book in this series is 'okay', but the rest of the books are a repetition of the end of the first one; plotless bits of, ""Let's go here!"" The books are headed nowhere and have a lot of loose ends."
4,Maximum Ride Rocks,"The Maximum Ride series is AWESOME. They are so funny, and full of action. They are almost never boring. For people who say it's totally unrealistic, I encourage you to keep reading the series. James Patterson talks about real world problems like global warmimg and pollution. Sure, flying bird kids may not be real but it's fun to imagine and I think Patterson makes it sound real. I think these books are amazing ad everyone should read them!!"
5,Stayed up late to read,"I gave it a try since it was free. I didn't know it was a series. Although I don't normally like series, I loved this one. I instantly bought the 2nd one and then the 3rd. I enjoyed all three. Fast paced, good characters and lots of action. I repeatedly stayed up late to see what happened. Text to speech not enabled. I like to listen on my way to work. The book was geared to teens, but I'm in my 40s and loved it."
5,An amazing book,This book is so good I could not put it down I started it yesterday and finished this morning. I'm so glad that I pick this book up off of my self not it's on to book #2
5,The Angel experiment,The book was very energizing. So much thrill and action. If I could read a book like this all the time I would. James Patterson's books suck you in from the very beginning. I would recommend it to just about anyone looking for a good book.
5,Likes of the book,"I liked the book all together because of the humor, action, and love in the book. I also liked the setting and the plot of this book. This should be a movie sometime soon :)"
1,Suspension of disbelief?,"If you are an adult considering reading this book, then don't bother (I did not know it was a kids book when I began reading it). It is a very poorly written story with zero suspension of disbelief. I only made it about 60 pages into the book before I couldn't take it anymore. Beyond the bad writing/dialog, I simply could not relate to a main character who is supposedly grieving beyond comprehension because her loved one was taken to be tortured and killed, but in route to rescue her she stops for a nap that turns into a slumber. After wasting all that time sleeping, she gets sidetracked again because she sees some kid who may be getting picked on that she has to stop to help... Really?? Loved one tortured and killed vs a kid maybe being picked on and you delay for that... Nice priorities! I'm sure it gets much worse than that, but that is where I had to stop."
2,"Novel, Or Comic Book without Pictures?","I have just recently finished the third book in the Maximum Ride series, and let me tell you, it is not worth your time. The back story is lacking, and only consists of Max (short for Maximum) briefly talking about what happened before you (the reader) came into play. The story then catapults into a broken record plot line of ""The Bad Guys"" showing up at wherever the group is, with the group narrowly escaping while making ""The Bad Guys"" look as foolish and inexperienced as possible. Repeat Plot line for all books, with a small dash of originality thrown in.RECAP:1. Would be a great gift for a young reader. (It does seem like it was written by someone under the age of 12.)2. Not so great for an older reader (15 and up)3. Don't read this, and hope that it gets better, it doesn't."
2,Helps you sleep,I bought the book cause I was always fascinated with fantastic flying novels. But the writing didn't captivate me. Maybe it was just me but that's how i felt...
2,"Shallow, no resolution to ANY plot threads",Really interesting germs of ideas and characters. Repetitive plot sequences Juvenile. I think many kids except perhaps very young ones would be bored by this book and would certainly feel short changed by the ending. I agree with the reviewer that said this read like a comic strip. I was very surprised since the author is so popular.
3,This Ride not for small children...,"The good: the book is written in a well-paced, conversational style that's quite easy to read. There's a lot of humor interspersed with the action scenes, which helps to keep the reader engaged. The protagonists are both distinctive and likable, though the depths of character development have yet to develop.The bad: though tagged ""young adult"", the emphasis should be on ""adult"". There's a fair bit of violence described in the book - it's not horribly graphic or gory, but it does, for instance, describe electrical shocks applied to a young child, which was quite enough to horrify ME.This is definitely not a stand-alone book. Although it ends at a natural pause in the action, it is clear one must buy future books to resolve the major plot-lines and answer the various questions the book raises about what's really going on."
4,But What Happened?,"I really liked the book. I had a hard time getting into it, but I also had a hard time putting it down once I got used to the teen dialog. I would have given it 5 stars but I don't like books that leave you dangling. Good story, interesting characters, not in any way predictable."
1,Look ... you took advantage of me by being less than honest ...,This story about a group a kids transformed by cloning to be able to fly and other special abilities is interesting ... But you could have told me up front that this free kindle book was a multi part book and this book part 1 had no ending ... and that the other parts were not free ... then I would not have read the 1st free book only to find there was no ending to the story ... it was a conscious deception to make us buy the 2nd and 3rd books to find out what happened. I'm sorry ... that is just plain dishonest and deceitful. You should be ashamed of yourself ... Your morals are lacking!
1,There is no ending,"I realize that this is supposed to be the start of a series, but really! A book should have an ending, closure, something that leaves us satisfied and still wanting. This book has neither of these. It just stops. All the questions that you had during the book and especially in the final moments, the new questions that you have, are left hanging. The questions like, who is Max, is Jeb her father, what about the other ""angels""? What about the other experiments that they freed? Who is the voice? I know it sounds like I'm probably giving some stuff away, but trust me I'm not. The book could have been great if he had finished it. As it is, you get only half the book, half the story and none of it is satisfying in the least. Stick with Harry Potter. His books have endings."
2,UGH! total dissapointment.,i love the max series. i almost had a stroke when i found out another one came out. i emmediately started reading and............this is SO not the max series i love! very sad. but you should read this anyway so the next one makes sense. :(-alysalovesbooks:)
1,A bit too good at what he does....,"James Patterson writes very accurately in the voice of a snotty thirteen year old girl. Unfortunately, this means the reader is stuck with a narrative by a snotty thirteen year old girl."
3,Okay book.,"Read this book through my local library on my Kindle. Okay book. Not necessarily good or bad. Some good suspense and action, but I am not sure that I buy the premise of the book. Clearly written to get the reader to buy the next volume in the series by the use of a cliff-hanger ending. I will stick with the Hunger Games trilogy instead."
5,A good read for people who get easily bored.,"Its that kind of book that makes u laugh wen ur character laughs, cry wen they cry, and smile wen they smile."
4,Multigenerational Book,"At first I thought this book was for teens when I picked it up on the desk of the teacher I was subbing for. It was her prep time so as a sub with time I started reading it. I became so interested that I purchased the book to finish reading it.(sub time only about 45 minutes) However, I was unaware that the book was part of a series and the open ended ending for subsequent books to follow left me a bit disappointed. I like a whole story in one book and am not into sequels. I guess that is the teen scene."
3,Dissapointed,"This book was fairly good in certain respects. It grabbed my attention early on. It was readable and fast paced. It was imaginative.However...In the long run, I was actually disappointed in it. The chapter breaks on every other page did not serve any real purpose or follow any reasonable form. The story started with difficulties and proceeded to the land of dark and tragic. And in the end there was no actual climax or conclusion. It was akin to reading a never ending teaser for a tragedy.I'm not at all sure why the author worked so hard to achieve such feelings of hopelessness and such a sense of there being no possibilities of ever reaching a resolution for any of the problems of the main character, but I had to conclude for myself, that as I am not entertained by misery this story was very poorly contrived. I'm actually quite heartily sick of the dark and despair of authors who seem to need therapy and good drugs."
4,Fun story appropriate for teens and adults alike,"Max is a smart and spirited 14-year-old with a few ""issues"". She is head of a ""flock"" of six kids who are on their own, and all of them just happen to be genetically-engineered progeny with wings and other special skills and talents.You've gotta love Max. She is always trying to do the right thing, and meet everyone's needs. She is Mom to three younger ones, and the leader of the motley gang that includes two teen boys a little younger than herself. They are on the run, with dangerously evil Erasers after them at every turn.This book is packed full of action, and is bursting with humanity. The kids are all very likable and believable. Max behaves very much like a typical 14-year-old girl. The storyline is full, appropriate for teens and adults alike, and very engaging. I look forward to reading the next book in the series!"
5,"Awesome, very entertaining.",This is a very good book. I love how it gives you a taste of what it's like to fly and be free. *WARNING* once you start you can't stop.
5,Couldn't put it down.,"We got this book in on a saturday (I work in a library) and I read it all day at work then finished the following day. I absolutely loved it. I can honestly say I couldn't put the book down. I was dying to find out what happened next. All the characters had their own personalities and were relatable (or at least I felt they were) I was also thrilled that, although the main character is a girl, many male teens will also enjoy it. I've already chosen to use this as the book for our next teen book discussion. A young boy came in a few days ago and asked for a good fantasy book, although this book isn't exactly in the fantasy catagory I still gave it to him and heavily encouraged him to read it. He came in today and couldn't stop talking about how great it was. I can't wait for a sequal."
2,Where's the Ending???,"Okay, so I found this book moderately entertaining, but where is the ending? I feel cheated! Like I spent all this time reading a story without any pay-off. That's just wrong! And guess what? It wasn't so good that I'm going to rush out and buy the next one (which I think, is probably the whole point.) Also, there were lots of huge holes in the plot...for example, all that guessing at a password to use the jerk's ATM card. An ATM would've locked them out after three or four tries. And would've confiscated the card. Same thing with the computer they were trying to hack into. Jeez, even I know that, and I'm not a computer whiz. This is the only James Patterson book I've ever read. Guess what? I probably won't ever read another one. And now that I've read this one, WHICH HAS NO ENDING, I'm sorry I wasted my time!"
3,Meh... just okay,"This book did not do much for me. I found this to be VERY similar to the Pendragon series in that the writing sounds cheesy. To me, at 22 years old, this sounded like an old person trying to talk young. The slang seemed dated and unpopular. I would rather read this if it was written in regular style rather than with faux 14 year old first person. As far as plot goes, it started off pretty slow but picked up about half way through and ended with a bang. So that was good. However, It did seem to me like the sense of urgency to rescue Angel was much to mild. Also it got really old to hear a play by play of every meal they ate through the entire book. If i read the second one it will be because I picked it up at the library, i dont think i'll be spending money on this."
2,A collection of cliff hangers...,"Don't ya hate it when you read all the way through a book and get to the end only to find nothing but a bag full of questions and no answers?If that's the kind of thing you hate, or even just find irritating, don't bother to read this book."
1,Did not enjoy it,"The book was poorly written and too fast-paced. I also thought the story was dark, depressing, and I did not enjoy it."
1,lame,"Writing a story that answers none of the questions it brings up is like buying a jig saw puzzle with half the pieces missing. You then discover you have to buy a new puzzle to continue, knowing that most likely that puzzle will be totally incomplete as well. The biggest mystery is how this became a best seller with lines that even the lamest of teenagers would be embarrassed to say. The boring non-stop action centers around birds constantly being attacked by and then, beating up wolves. Must be a lot of kids out there getting beaten up by bullies. Peter Pan, this is not!This one goes in the trash."
5,I love this book!,"The Maximum Ride Series is great. I have read all of them so far and I can't wait for the fourth one.If you want to you can check out Fang's Blog at www.maximumride.blogspot.com . My favorite character is Iggy. Even though he's blind he can still do some amazing things (like make bombs and stuff like that).I think that everyone should read this book. It really makes you think about a lot of stuff that could and might happen someday, if it hasn't already.Just read it. I think that it's better than Harry Potter. If you don't like it than don't read the rest of the books but I think that you should at least read the first one."
4,Maximum Ride Review,I purchased Maximum Ride for my son who has enjoyed other books in this series. He liked them all. My only complaint was it took a long time to receive it after I ordered it.
5,page turner,This was an excellent read. Once you start reading this book it is very hard to put down. If you enjoyed reading other books by patterson you will definetly enjoy this one also!
3,Not too bad and not too good!,"Well I read the book and there is a big BUNCH of unanswered questions that let you hanging there confused by how is it possible this is the end! that was the main disappointment for me and, as I saw around here, it's the same for the others.For teens I think this story has a lot of tormenting and dark science stuff. I don't really know if it's really good to write about that in this concentration for this age of readers.Other than that I can't really say more since this book was one of the first books I have read (yes I'm a new reader) so my taste wasn't really stable yet and I didn't have any strong basis to criticize very well."
4,the angel experiment,this book was very exiting and full of suspence. I could not stop reading. It was a great book and I cant wait to read the next book.
4,A ride of maximum excitement,"The first edition of the maximum ride series is absolutely amazing. The way that James Patterson develops the Flock characters within the plot line is top class, and the amount of excitement present within the book is the equivalent of four books by anyone else. I definitely recommend not only this book, but the entire series by Patterson, and go for the ride yourself."
4,How to get your kid to read!,"This fast paced sci-fi adverture thriller has just about everything thrown in there. And it is thrown in with the expertise, only a professional like James Patterson can master.This book actually raises your heartbeat. Never a dull moment. Constant action with just enough character building to ensure a constant state of anxiety on behalf of our heroes. Short choppy structure and constant crisis keep you chomping on your nails.My only complaint is I felt I was missing something. I felt I was dropped into the story and it was never really explained as the book unfolded At the end of the novel I still felt a little dissatisfied with my grip on exactly what was going on. I understand that this is part of the ongoing mystery - but I have also read a couple of the sequels.Anywhoooo - Maximum ride is a hell of a ride and I would recommend it to anyone with a short attention span or is just way to busy to wait for the author to get the story moving."
4,Flaws to the book,Book felt a little to short if you think about what they did overall. Spoiler alert!!!!!! If you think about it did they really find all they were looking for at the lab? It's a good read..
5,Really Good Book!,Loved this Book I'm a first time reader of James Patterson and i absolutely love this book I will get the second!
3,The bird girl,"Interesting start to the book, somewhat contrived to keep up the pace of action in the middle, ended strong. One would have to like this genre to like this book as i did.I would recommend to others that i know that prefer this genre."
5,Incredible Series!,"I just simply love the whole Maximum Ride series! I had borrowed my friend's copy of The Angel Experiment and read it in one night. I eventually bought the following of the series, School's Out - Forever, and Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports, and read through them just as quickly! I then decided that my ""collection"" of the series looked pretty sad without having purchased my own copy of The Angel Experiment, so I bought one (very cheap, compared to several nearby bookstores!) off of Amazon and loved it all over again!This series is about The Flock, which consists of Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. They're DNA experiments--98% human and 2% avian. Basically, you, as a reader, get to tag along with the Flock as they endure many exciting and thrilling adventures. I couldn't put the book down! There's so much going on (action, thrills, mystery, adventure, a tad bit of romance--the works!), so be sure to keep up with the pace!"
5,Great for the young and the young at heart,I bought this because I love James Patterson's books. My 13 year old grandson read it and loved it. I am his 59 year old grandmother and I loved it too.
3,Gods name in vain,"Its a great book, but it uses Gods name vain. If its okay with the auther please delete all Gods name in vain."
4,"OK, but not great","I liked this book. I am not going to say it was great, because I have read better. Much better. I thought this book was going to be amazing from first page to the very end, but by the time I was half way through I was wanting to quit. I think part of the reason I didn't enjoy it is do to the length. This book was sooo long! I just kept guessing when it was going to end and when it finally did end I gave a huge sigh of relief! I also thought the plot was a bit dull... The book was an ""adventure"", but some things seemed like they repeated themselves. Over and over again. For example, the hunt for the Institute. It took up over half the book. I like things to go a little faster. At this point I am not sure if I will continue reading the books in the series."
3,No Harry Potter.,"I've read a couple of Patterson's books, and read his description of this series as ""for readers of all ages"". Then I checked the reviews, and got the book.Frankly, I was expecting more of this book. It's ok, but not great. I'd say it may be a book for teenagers, but not for me or my young kids. The author comments were misleading.Furthermore, the book is obviously intended to create a series, with many questions being left without an answer. I finished the book, but I don't care about the characters at all. I did not get hooked."
5,Maximum Ride - Just Read It!,"This review is really for my daughter - who loved this book and the whole series. Here are some of her comments: ""If you want really funny stuff, read Maximum Ride. If you want really adventurous stuff, read Maximum Ride. If you want a combination of both, read Maximum Ride."" [I think she liked it]."
4,Loved it!!,"First of all I'm a Sunday at Tiffany's, Nicholas Sparks, Twilight kind of girl. I got this book cause it was a freebie and it helps me branch out and find new things I like when I don't have anything to read. From page one of this book I was hooked. It is very fast paced , you can't put it down. It's a root for the under dog kind of book. It's just creepy enough to make it very suspenseful but not really gory or graphic. There isn't really any lauguage or anything vulgar in it which is a rare find this day and age. I would happily let my 11 or 7 yr olds read this. I think it ios very entertaining. I read this book in one day during my daughter's nap."
5,a great book!,"this book is a page turner...i finished it in two days! im sorry bt i have to dissagre with all the haters and people who thin its childish....this is a book for all ages....even though im not an adult, i can still confidently say that all adults will enjoy this book as much as children. it has action and adventure in every page...i love it and i am so glad my friemd told me to read the series...i can say with full saitisfaction that james patterson is TRULY a awesme writer!"
3,Maximum Ride,"Boy, have I been chastised by everyone for simply saying I like the book. It's not a book that interested me. It's intense, and I love intense, but it just wasn't the right kind of intense. It also had promise and that is why I gave it three stars. I love all of the characters good or bad. James Patterson is brilliant at variety when it comes to characters. But I just couldn't get into the plot. It wasn't satisfying and didn't make me desperate to finish the book. But like I said, I'm going to give this book a chance and continue reading the series."
4,Great series starter,I thought that this was a good first entry into this series. The pace moves quickly and there is more than enough mystery to keep you turning the pages looking for clues.
1,Sub-par Writing,"I read this really quickly, and that's not a good sign, like eating your veggies when you're a kid just to get it over with. I have a habit of having to finish the books I start even if they're bad. This is one of those books.The ideas in this book are interesting and even compelling; however, the writing is choppy and bland. It's driven by dialogue and not description or plot. I find Patterson's attempt at first-person writing from the perspective of a 14-year-old girl to be unconvincing. It's like he's really writing her as if she's a boy but he's just calling her a girl. Maybe he's trying to appeal to more people that way but I find it negatively affects the character.My husband bought this to read on a long flight and he quit because he couldn't stand the writing, and he's a fan of some of Patterson's other writing. I think all the hub-bub is just because Patterson is famous for adult fiction. He should stick with that. This foray into YA fiction was a disaster."
2,half a book,i am def a big fan of book series that have a lot of books in them i.e. harry potter. the big difference with harry potter is that each book is somewhat self contained. when read together it adds t the whole experience but each book has a beginning middle and end. this book is just the beginning of the whole story. there are a lot of interesting story ideas that literally go nowhere. it really is half of a book.
2,Sorry I Read it,"This book is not good young adult fiction. It's simply dumbed down adult fiction. From the unbelievable premise to the concocted adversaries to the shameless plug for the next book, this is an exercise in merchandising more than literature. It doesn't even work as a beach read. Avoid it."
5,Awesome book!,"This is a really good book. There is a lot of action and suspense, and the chapters are short, so if you hate endlessly long chapters (Like me) then that's another reasong to read this. There were really only two things that annoyed me in this book:1. Things always seem to work out perfectly for Max and her friends. When they are out of money, POOF, there's a bank card right next to them. When Angel almost drowns, POOF, she can breathe under water. Fang gets beaten senseless, POOF, he's okay. It get's tiresome after a certain point.2. At the end (I'm not giving any major spoilers though), when Max and Ari are fighting, Ari says something about not trying to kill Max or something like that, I don't remember. Sorry Ari, seeing as you have been TRYING TO KILL MAX THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BOOK, I can't believe you.Well, those were the only things that annoyed me. Other than that, this is an awesome book."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. I was looking for a CD version of Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment to use in my classroom. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to find your place in the book and the chapters are not in order."
2,CLUELESS,"I too pre-ordered this book back in March thinking it was a continuation of 'When the Wind Blows' and 'The Lake House'. Read carefully - this book is geared towards young adults! Wish I knew then what I know now. It is a very basic, basic story line that you just don't expect from a Patterson book.Still love the original characters which is what drew me to this book in the first place."
2,Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment,"I liked the first two ""bird kids"" books much better than this one. I wish Mr. Patterson had stuck to that format. I was anxious to learn what happened after the end of the last book to some of the characters. I was very disappointed that the new Erasers were introduced. This book was not nearly as good as the first two."
3,The Angel Experiment,"Vary well written. I enjoyed it very much. I am now reading the second book in this series, and I will probably read another."
5,Love this Book!,"I just took a chance getting this book, I love the Author, but had never heard of Maximum Ride. I'm loving the book, not quite finished yet. I intend to order the rest of the series!!"
5,Breathtaking,very thrilling and exciting. first chapter wanted to dig in and finish.i really liked this book very much. Best Book Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,the angel experment,"Again thought this might be some more Lake House and When The Wind Bloweswasn't this series is for kids 13 and down,will give series to the library."
3,Patterson doing Children's book????????????,Ok my Expectations were way too high.......but after reading the book............oh it seemed TOOO SHORT...........thts a GOOD thing..........but well Patterson isnt convincing as a Teenage Writer.........trying to tell the story from a teeanger's view............sometimes it seems forced.........thought it is a Quick book.......and nothign really revealing took place in the book.........i only hope for things to get better in the second book.......JOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Must Read!!!!!,"If you know a child who absolutely HATES reading, is glued to their video game or has very little patience even to read the label to a Snicker Bar, then this IS THE BOOK for them.Full of action, written in natural teen and kid language and very short chapters. The short chapters are very action packed which motivates you to go on the next one, and next one and...... Before the child knows it, they have read many chapters thus boosting motivation for reading. Mine have said to me, I read 20 chapters, WOW!Another factor that is to be considered that it has many topics that deal with Science, Geography and Social issues. This books lends itself to many discussions.So there you have it. If there is a child out there who does not like this book, there is a serious problem. This book would even bait, The Grinch from Dr. Seuss."
4,Quick fun romp,"As with most of James Patterson's work, this book is not the next contender for the Pulitzer, but it is a quick fun read, expecially for young adults seeking something outside of the Harry Potter urban fantasy vein that has taken over YA lit in the last few years.These characters are wise beyond their years from living on the lam for so long but they're written so that it's obvious that they're still kids rather than adults in little bodies. In a way, this is Cynthia Voight's Homecoming with an edge."
5,My14 year old loved this book,My nephew and sister in law were reading this and reccomended it. My 14 year old loved it and we just ordered the next two books! Thank you James Patterson for sharing your gift with children- Blessings Sandra
1,Been mugged lately????,"I'm not going to venture into the literary quality of this book. It's a little bland for me but then Patterson's works often are... it's still not a bad read. What IS bad is the realization (upon finishing the book) that THERE IS NO ENDING!!!!! That's right folks, in little more than a mental mugging the writer attempts to force the reader into buying the sequel in the hope that maybe IT will have some sort of lucid conclusion. Now, I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I do have my good days. It's the old ""fool me once"" thing..... how apt do you think I am to actually buy the sequel and cross my fingers hoping that IT will not be an attempt to roll me over into yet a third outing? A little hint.... put your money on NOT!!!!"
3,Left Hanging...,"Okay, let me first say that I am a HUGE James Patterson fan! But I have noticed that the last few books I've read have been slipping. Maximum Ride was no different. I loved the main character and how her personality was portrayed through the writing. Even the story itself could have been good. The problem was that it felt like a roller coaster that went up and down - up and down - up and down - and then crashed. There was no ending. The book just stopped and I was VERY disappointed!"
2,What are you doing James?,"Not worth it, no ending, it builds and stops.....Stick to the alex cross books....."
2,adequate patterson these days,"I enjoyed the book, a quick read, as are all of Mr. Patterson's books lately. At least this was one that I wanted to finish. The last two books of his, I gave up since I was bored. If you are a Patterson ""fan"", this is worth a try. It is probably available from a library."
2,Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment,"The book is good with all of the action and things but it uses the name of the Lord in vain. It would be good if they could fix that but hey I don't know anyone personally who rubs elbows with James Patterson. All of the other books in that series: school's out forever, saving the world and other extreme sports, the final warning,"
5,Awesome book,"This book is the first in the maximum ride series. This book is amazing and very detailed. This book is five stars and I will read more of the series soon. I just found out that you should have the second book ""School's out forever"" on hand for when you finish this one because this has a major cliffhanger. I can't tell you what because it's major! Also from just the start of the book you are wondering mainly is Angel going to be okay along with other questions."
3,"OK, best left to the Young Adults to read","Both my mother and my daughter recommended this book. I have to say, I found the author's attempt at a 14 year old girl's voice to be unconvincing and annoying.Despite all the ""action"" not much happens in this book. The kids run away from the bad guys a lot...and inexplicably they all get away, they all live. Why are the Erasers chasing them and beating them up all the time? It doesn't make sense at all how the flock always gets away, especially the scene on the beach when Jeb shows up. The next chapter offers no explanation on how the flock got off the beach without the Erasers stopping them.Obviously nothing happens because the author intended this to be a series from the get-go, but I won't be reading the rest. This is one YA series best left to the teens."
5,Epic!,I love this book and i cant wait to read the next book in the series i hope its as good or even better
4,The Angel Experiment,There were many thrilling parts. Over all it was a good book. This review was done by Mina. I'm shirley's daughter and I'm 14 yrs old.
3,review of Maximum Ride,I haven't enjoyed the book as much as I usually enjoy James Patterson books. Usually I love them
1,Feel cheated...,"Like others, I bought this book thinking it was part 3 of a series. I feel cheated that Patterson is using the same premise for a basically completely different book. Same bird kid thing with one named Maximum. He shouldn't have used any stuff from the first two books, and I wouldn't have felt like I wasted my money."
1,HORRIBLE book,"My GOD, this book was awful. A friend of mind told me that these books were being made into a movie and outlined the premise, and (ugh) it didn't sound so bad - I enjoy random ""experiment/people escape from the lab, try to make it in the real world"" random fiction. After reading 3/4 of the book, I have to wonder if James Patterson is even literate, much less capable of producing decent fiction. I hate buying books and not finishing them, but I can't even think of a REASON to care about making it to the end. The characters are all essentially the same (dull and undeveloped) person, with little nervous tics and random handicaps to intended to make them seem distinct - but instead, making the act of trying to empathize with them vaguely nauseating.NOT recommended under any circumstances, unless you're looking for something to just kill a couple of brain cells and punish you for your sins."
1,disappointed,"I've read all of James Patterson's books, but this will probably be the last. Very disappointing!"
3,A Teen's review,"This book was OK. It did not end, and was very predictable, but still, if you have nothing better to read you might as well. I agree with many of the adult reaviews, that it was half fantasy and half real. It had little of anything memorable, but it is deffinatly a book for teens. I can not think of anyone else who would find it remotle interesting."
1,Left Hanging,"I have never felt so cheated by a ""novel"". The story is just unfolding when suddenly I am reading an epilogue! I was beginning to wonder why the 35% to 40% white space and all of the extra verbiage when the book suddenly ends. There was no warning that this was just the start of a series, but even so I see no reason why it could not have stood on its own feet as, for instance, the Harry Potter stories do. I should have sensed the movie plan and foreseen the hacking that I've come to expect from Patterson in later years. Still I resent the waste of time. One star for the movie action potential."
2,Absolutly insulting...,"After a yaer of many different friends saying that I should read this book, I felt ,as a 13 year old, I should read it. After the read, I was insulted. The authoer of this book, James Patterson, who really is an adult level author attempted to write books for younger children or young adult. But he sure blew it. It was very clean and edited. It felt as though I were a 5 year old reading this book. Also, it was incredibly unrealistic, to violent, and to dumb. This is a book that can NEVER be made into a movie, and if it was made into one, i and several other friends would not go. Although the author was simply trying to do something different, I give him the credit of at least trying it. I mean, it was not great, not good, below ok, but not bad. So my grade stands, but if you are a teenager, do not read."
1,Ouch,"Patterson has discovered the unfortunate truth that quantity can be more profitable than quality. This is a dreadful book. Of course, every Patterson book I have ever slogged through was also dreadful, so. . .Patterson seems to believe that pyrotechnics can replace any sort of plot or character development. He is sadly mistaken. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Where's the ending,"I thought the book was a page turner with plenty of action. The writing was fair but not anything to brag about. A book like this is more about the story and less about the art of writing. Now the most annoying thing I find with this book is that it doesn't have an ending. I think all books should have an ending. Since this one just drops the reader off in nowhere land, I am not inclined to read anymore about this story in the numerous sequels since it is clear to me the book is about commercialism and the story is secondary."
5,Wow!,"The sound quality is spectacular. Previn's interpretation & LSO's performance are stunning. I have several LSO Live recordings, and they're all great.After listening to this, I can throw away my other recordings of this piece (which are with with Klemperer and Guilini)."
5,I thought it was hilarious!,this movie was really one of the best comedy acts that i have ever seen. i think that everyone should see this - tracy ullman is so funny!
2,Not a good text,"This book in my opinion is not the one to enjoy the beauty of the subject and mechanics in general. There is a vast amount of material amassed but the structure of the book is poor.It seems being overburden with details and particulars and lacking unified clear consistent approach. In addition some mistakes are just plain annoying. If one wants to be serious about vibrations - do not sweat over this book. It can be just another somewhat usefull reference book to find some particular solution to for some particular problem.Instead one can study mechanics with beautifully written classical L.Meirovitch, ""Fundamentals of Vibrations"" which is much more original, rigorous, clear, usefull and serious book to have."
2,Poor Book,"I used this textbook for my Mechanical Vibrations course and was very displeased with it. My biggest gripe is the lack of examples in each chapter. There are an abundance of homework problems at the end of each chapter, but the vast majority of them are not illustrated at all in example problems. I noticed this immediately in Chapter 1 when attempting to solve several of the problems. The text also develops equations and formulas without detail and explanation. Luckily my teacher developed the eqations in class lecture and provided the majority of information for the course. While working out homework and test problems that were assigned, the book was of little use for me. I think the clarity of writing could be better, as well. By the way, I got an A in the course and still found the book to be poor."
2,An undergraduate text which is unclear...not enough examples,"On the surface, this text seems to cover everything and seems well-organized. However, further examination will reveal that it is often unclear and seems to skip or briefly mention many important subjects. Further, there are not nearly enough examples to convey the subject matter to the average undergraduate engineering student. Unfortunately, it has been my experience (after 6 years as a mechanical engineering student) that there are hardly any well-written texts on the subject of mechanical vibrations. This one only reinforces that notion."
5,Best book for Vibration course of Master degree,"This book in my point of view as a Master student in Mechanical Engineering is the best for Vibration. Examples are given with practical applications. You can find many interesting challenging problems at the end of each chapter. I found it much better than Thomson's book, as it explains the examples more clearly. Another postive point that I have found is the summeries given at the end of each section. They include many important issues related to that specific section."
4,Excellent Source of Information- Highly Recommended,"This is one of the best books, I've found on Mechanical Vibrations. As a 12 year, Ph.D. veteran in field Mechanical Engineering, I highly recommend this book to advanced undergraduates and graduates. I found the ones who complain about a book or totally disregard it are the ones who have poor academic ability or are below average students. There is no other book that explains very complicated subject of Mechanical Vibrations as well as this Book By Singiresu Rao. He is an excellent author coming from Purdue university. His book has been used in academic field since its first edition in 1986. He uses delightful examples to simplify the subject. I also find his biography of various scientist whom contributed to the field of vibrations fascinating. He also gives out FORTRAN computer codes which stimulate students learning. This briefly sums an expert's opinion."
5,The Norman Rockwell Album,"This is a large, ""coffee table"" type book with hundreds of beautiful paintings / works by Norman Rockwell, many in color. He adds his own description of each painting, describing the models and locations, and detailing the evolution of his career in words and illustrations."
3,mom of a power rangers fan,not being a power rangers fan myself but living with two children who are (3 & 6 years old) BIG fans of the rangers i have had occasion to watch this movie. in comparision to some of the other p.r. movies and the tv show i thought this had somewhat less senseless violence and actually had a few scenes showing the power of teamwork and compassion (they have to rescue a furry little guy). the kids will love it and if you're forced to watch it enough times with them you'll actually come to enjoy laughing at divatox and her cronies and cheering for the (ever-good) rangers.
5,Shift into Turbo!,"This is a very cool movie, especially if you like either Power Rangers or generous chest and butt shots of five...well, I'm getting off the subject. Long story short, there's an alien called Lerigot who is captured by a space pirate named Divatox, to free her fiancee Maligore. On the way she grabs two humans to turn evil (where have we seen this before?), coincidentally two of the first Rangers, Pink Ranger Kimberly and Red and Gold Ranger Jason. Meanwhile, one of the Rangers (I won't say who) falls and sprains a muscle in his back. The other Rangers, along with his replacement, have to go to the island of Muranthias to thwart Divatox's plans and to save their friends. They aren't quick enough, as...rent the movie and and out what happens!"
3,kids are amuzed,"My son loves the power rangers but only watched this movie once. It amuzed him, but unlike his other movies he didn't want to watch it over and over. (my son is 5 years old)"
5,POWER RANGERS ARE THE BEST!!!,IF YOUR A POWER RANGERS FAN U MUST SEE IT! IT'S A HAVE TO SEE ! GO GO POWER RANGERS !! YYYYYYYAAAAAHHHOOOO!!! POWER RANGERS ROCK !!
3,Lost interest,"I'm a mom to a four year old..he is a huge power rangers fan, but he lost interest watching this movie. :("
3,Disappointment,"Though I look back on the first Power Rangers movie with much pleasure, the only thing THIS movie has going for it is the fact that Kimberly and Jason are in it. Surprisingly, Jason's actor did a good job, despite his previously horrible work on the show. But this should have been a 3-4 part mini-series. It didn't even look like a movie. Unless you're a fan of Power Rangers (which I am), I don't think this is worth buying."
2,"Shift into turbo, and don't hit that dead end!","A ridiculous follow-up to the unsuccessful movie of the same name has the Rangers, once more, out to stop a brutal villainess named Divatox from taking information a creature named Lerigot posesses and thus ruining his entire colony. A turbo excuse for Haim Saban to grow power hungry."
2,Seriously Lacking...,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. This movie really sucks compared to the first one. First a kid named Justin becomes a Power Ranger after another one is injured and the character and the acting just doesn't cut it. What also sucks is that Kimberly and Jason from the original Mighty Morphin PRs are there and it is clear that Tommy still have feelings for Kimberly and as a fan of the Tommy/Kimberly romance Kat being there just ruins everything. Divatox is cool as a villian but doesn't compare to Rita and Ivan Ooze as she is too conceited and superficial which gets annoying after a while. Overall, at this point the series Power Rangers has changed so much that what made the Power Rangers popular is completely GONE. I can't even identify with the characters anymore. EVERYTHING has changed. The only thing I did like was the technological advances in their Zords and their gadgets. Thats it."
1,Wretched...,"As a kid, I was rather fond of the Power Rangers, but this movie fails to generate the same fondness I had for it. It's mostly dull and uneventful, moving at a pace that would make a snail bored. The whole movie is ridiculous and has no shred of plot, direction, or action. It simply exists on the screen, loud, boistrous, and meaningless. I hated this movie to the extent that I started examining the hairs in my leg. Boring boring boring."
2,Scary,"My 4 year old son watched this movie once and has no interest in seeing it again. He said ""there are no good Power Rangers in it"" and it was scary."
1,horrible,"What ever you do, don't buy this movie. The acting is horrible, and the special effects are cheap. If I could give it less then 1 star, I would give it -50. If you watch it, and are over 13. You will understand what I mean! I would only recommend this movie to kids under 8. I would rather see a movie with alot more action. Oh yeah, don't try any of the moves at home"
3,Cars Cars and More Rangers,"Its a disasteraus day for the rangers Roky broke his back, Lerigote the Liariean comes to but cant survive under the son then Justin fids out who the Power Rangers are! Can the Power Rangers take any more disaster?"
3,OK,"This movie was NOWHERE NEAR as awsome and incredible as the first one. NOWHERE. The Red Ranger is one of the most horrible actors ever, but... this movie has some good points. 1. The villaness, Divatox. She was hilarious, a great villian. 2. The new Blue Ranger Justin, a 12-year old in a ranger suit. ( Better actor than the Red Ranger.) 3. The Pink Ranger, a good actor, cool, and pretty. nuff'said. 4. The appearance of Jason and Kimberly. Jason improved on his acting. 5. Finally, the wilderness scene and the Megazord. 6. The soundtrack. That's it, other elements in the movie are okay, yet, beware the Red Ranger and the weak plotline."
5,Power Rangers,"I have been looking for the Power Ranger DVD's for a long time for my grandson, he was excited that I found it because they are not in stores."
2,Turbo A Power Rangers Movie,This movie is lame.First of all why didnt they explain how they lost their zeo powers? Im still left in the dark about this one? Second why is a 10 year old playing a power ranger? Couldnt someone a little older played the blue ranger? Third of all why couldnt Jason morph? He still had that zeonizer didnt he? The only good parts are lauging at how stupid that wizard Lerigot looks and getting to daze at Kimberlys sexy body.
2,Bring out the marshmallows.,"Okay, since ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" came out, Haim Saban produced an entire string of follow-ups including a number of new monsters, megazords, the works. This movie, the second film installment in the MMPR film series, is pointless. It's about Hilary Shepard Turner's attempt to garner information from Lerigot on a volcanic island. And you've guessed it: our former heroes have to stop her.Story finished, with that film, this Power Rangers trash went downhill once and for all."
1,cheaper,you can find them at autozone for $8 each. its too expensive here. qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq
3,Mislabled?,These seem to be cut a little small. Construction is fine. They have been quickly relegated to the back of the drawer.
2,Where's the fabric?,"There is so little cotton the briefs are almost sheer. They will wear out in no time at all. Normally I wear size 36 but due to a previous review, I ordered size 38. They are tight. Not for me."
5,Hamilton X-Wind Watch,This is a GREAT watch. No issues or problems after several weeks of use.This watch is made like a rock!!!!
2,"sloppy fit, low quality","I wish I had stuck with the sunex branded tools, they are just a little bit more money but way better quality than these. I bought their wobbly 3/8"" extension set and it's superb. this extension set is poor quality finish and very loose fit into the sockets, barely holds them. not recommended."
5,a question for all those who own the new verion of the Isle Of Wight on CD...,"there's no doubt in my mind that this show is just as good as the Live At Leeds album, however, my focus is on the remastering job. here, I'll explain... I have the original version of the Isle Of Wight 1970 CD set that came out on Sony/Legacy back in the late 90's. since I'm a stickler and a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality, my question is this... to the people that own this newer version: is it worth it for me to get the new 2010 remastered version of the 1970 Isle Of Wight CD's, considering that I already have the original one? is the sound quality that much better that it would be worth spending the money for it? your feedback on this would br greatly appreciated."
5,The Highlight of the Isle of Wight Festival,"This album is a spectacular performance by the Who. Energy, passion and fire are put into every song played. This album is especially good for completists with songs like ""Water"" which never turned up on a studio Who record. Also, unlike the Deluxe Edition of Leeds, this concert is presented all in order. Tommy is in the middle of the set where it should be, instead of being placed on another disc. This is a great performance, and any Who fan would be wise to pick it up."
3,Do You Think Its All Right? Yeah. All Right.,"I'm going to have to agree with those who say that this is no ""Live at Leeds."" Pete Townshend's guitar, after ""Young Man's Blues,"" starts sounding puny, and although he's never been known as a great lead guitarist, his playing here is extremely choppy. John Entwhistle and Keith Moon are enjoyable throughout, though, and Roger Daltrey sounds fine. Generally speaking, though, the whole band meanders and doesn't seem to quite have it together. The first three songs are still incredible, though, and you get to here how they pulled ""Tommy"" off in person. If you're a Who fan, get it, but don't be without ""Live at Leeds"" to hear the REAL deal."
3,for the serious Who fan only,"If you want live Who and don't have Live at Leeds, for God's sake, don't mess with this recording of the Who on an off-night and buy the best live album ever released. Live at Leeds, of course!"
2,It's too tired,"Everything about this release is wrong, except for the content. Maybe if the sound was recompressed, remixed and washed out a couple of times it might be tolerable. It seems most of The Who's punch from ""Live at Leeds"" was lost in the open air of this festival. I've heard better bootlegs, but not to say that this recording is ""dirty"", because it's not. If anything is too quiet, clean and tired. I'd pass."
1,who did this?,this is by far the worst live disc I have heard. I was at this show and it was nothing like this muffed miss mix they so shamelessly put out here. Townsend owes me and every other fan a personal apology
5,Very highly recommended reading for all Teen Titan fans,"Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the popular New Teen Titans DC comic book series, Titans Companion is an engaging survey of the history of the series through interviews with creators Marv Wolfman, George Perez, Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez, Len Wein, Eduardo Barreto, and other fan favorites. A comprehensive Silver Age section also has interviews with Neal Adams, Nick Cardy, Dick Giordano, among others. Illustrated with black-and-white comic panels and rare character sketches, Titans Companion is a ""must-have"" for fans of the series, or anyone interested in a behind-the-scenes look at creative decisions in the comic book industry (such as choosing to dress Nightwing, formerly Robin, in dark colors to make him less of a target but exposing some of his chest to appeal to female fans, now that his legs are covered). Very highly recommended reading for all Teen Titan fans."
1,Not quite as advertised,"Confirmed observation by previous reviewer - not the same as a Honeywell-branded filter - about half as thick. Advertising a little misleading which does imply a ""Honeywell/Enviracaire"" prefilter. I am anticipating my HEPA filter will now clog more quickly unless I replace these about twice as often as I'm used to. The ad should not say ""Honeywell"" in it."
5,I Love it,This book was a Christmas present to my mother; after she passed away I kept it in my collection. I enjoy the recipes that they have; I use this book for special occasions and for planning dinners during the week. I Love this book it will be passed down to my daughter.
1,Wasn't impressed with this cookbook,"I had high hopes for this book as I'm collecting old fashioned cookbooks, but what a disappointment. The recipes seemed a bit dull and uninspiring. What a waste of money."
2,A TIRED CUSTOMER,I bought this recipe book and the next day i look on the internet and Annabelle's Soul Food Seasoning is giving out the same and probably easier recipes for FREE! I'm not one for coporate battles but this is pathetic i'm tired of this corporate greed.... If i have any say... Try Annabelle's... Their seasoning is more authentic and their recipes are FREE!
2,Library Book,"I am so glad that I didn't trust the reviews on this book. Something said go to the library and check out the book first and then buy it. Needless to say, I will not be buying this book. I tried four recipes out of it and none of them turned out tasty. The pound cake was nasty and wasn't moist or sweet. The cabbage was tough. The only thing that turned out good was the fried chicken, and who can't cook fried chicken? The mac and cheese was decent, but not mouth watering.I was ashamed to serve this crap to my southern-bred boyfriend. If I ever want to make the dishes like my mother made, this isn't the book to reference. I may not know the exact recipes for my favorite soul foods, but I sure do know how they're suppose to turn out, not to mention taste."
5,Thanks for teaching me how to cook soul food,"I have always wanted to learn how to cook soul food, but have never been a very good student and most cookbooks have not been helpful. This cookbook is wonderful, I am in it almost every weekend, figuring out what I am going to cook or bake next. The recipe for Sylvia's greens - EXCELLENT! I have also tried Crizette's crispy corn fritters - DELICIOUS! The recipes are simple and easy to follow - the instructions are the BEST! I thank Sylvia and my family thanks Sylvia! Move over, Betty Crocker - this is my new favorite cookbook reference!"
5,Gloria Estefan blows all other latin singers away!,"Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Selena-none of them come close to Gloria Estefan's talent! A combination of latin and pop, this album makes music from any other latin singer look like crap! With the great dance tracks ""Higher"", ""The Heart Never Learns"", ""You'll Be Mine (Party Time)"", ""Path Of The Right Love"", and the emotional tracks ""Show Me The Way Back To Your Heart"", ""Along Came You"" for her daughter and ""Reach"", this album is latin music at its best! Gloria rocks better than almost any other artist. Buy this album."
4,Efectos latinos emocionalizan este album.,"Despues de estar en Sudamerica por dos anos volvi a escuchar este DC y me gusto mucho mas. Canciones como ""I'm Not Giving You Up"", ""Destiny"", y ""Steal Your Heart"" hacen un impacto mucho mas grande con un ritmo latino."
2,A dissapointment,"It's odd to note that the only reason why I ended up liking Gloria was after hearing her perfom at the 1996 olympics. Her Song ""Reach"" truly captivates the mind and soul and reflects the raw tallent a singer who can enflict her feelings of emotion to the audience with her voice. Sadly the rest of the album lacked to what should have been a grammy winner. The over use of the afro-latin beat killed it and that ever cheeky ""higher"" was probably one of her worst songs ever written. In short if you are appreciate the true afro rhythem beat, then you would not mind this album, but for the rest of us who appreciate Gloria as that latin Dancing, Disco singing, Miami Sound machine girl, then you'd appreciate her other albums, particularly her greatest Hits CD."
5,"A little different, but I liked it.","This album is a little bit different than previous hits like CUTS BOTH WAYS or INTO THE LIGHT. At first, I didn't care for it that much, but as I listened to it more the depth of the music and the odd rhythms of some of the songs really grew on me. Now this album is among my favorites.Gloria likes to experiment, and I call this experiment a success!"
5,Gloria's spiritual side...,"It's a little different from her earlier CD's. The songs have a more spiritual and mystical sound. There are chants and Afro-Cuban rhythms, but at the same time it's very much an adult-contemporary pop CD."
3,BIG Disappointment,"Though I *do* love Celibidache very much (and I think his Brahms 2nd Symp w/ Municher is among the best available recordings ever), this CD is of particular disappointment. Specifically Mozart's 40th lacks the real Mozart spirit, and when it comes to conduct one of Mozart's most difficult symphonies, Celibidache fails miserably. Furtwaengler, Erich Kleiber and even Harnoncourt are among the best options for this incredible symphony. Tempo here is incredibly slow, even more than usual, losing the point during the development of the first tempo (as many many conductors), and the genius won't appear again on this recording. So don't throw away your money with this version. Instead, go for the ones I mentioned, but if you HAVE to buy a CD by Celibidache, get any of his Brahms' symphonies (specially the 2nd, that's a *MUST*), or Tchaikovsky's 6th, or Bruckner's 9th. But stay away from this CD. Unfortunately, Celibidache cannot always be great."
4,Magical story about true love,"Yes, this is a fantasy, but in a world where a movie about hobbits can be nominated for best picture, I am willing to suspend my disbelief a tad bit for this beautiful fable about the true connection of soul mates. Meg Ryan is young, thin, and yummy to the eyes, but young and yummy Alec Baldwin can tell when she's not herself. And he knows the difference between the wrapping and the gift."
5,Alec Baldwin crying like a girl totally sold the gay true love.,"During the 80s when there seemed to be no end in sight to the Aids epidemic, many creative talents tried to communicate to the mainly heterosexual public that gay love is real love, gay love is true love and the loss of one's beloved is just as devastating and unacceptable. With his play Prelude to a Kiss, Craig Lucas shared this truth by making the characters the standard young heterosexual couple falling in love and getting married then he SWITCHed out the P.Y.T. wife with an old man. And Alec Baldwin's tearful kiss was completely believable."
2,Not so good.........,"If you have nothing better to watch then you might be able to justify your time spent on this one. Both main actors are rather young and haven't fully developed their acting skills at this point. Actually, Patty Duke (Rita's mother) gave the best performance. It's OK - but........"
2,Loud ear piercing noise,"This is totally something you are really looking for. I have found this by surfing Amazon and getting recommendations. This one is strange. Not a bad strange. Think Sigur Ros with the volume turned up. No Icelandic lyrics but, they do have their own way of putting lyrics to this music. It also has some beats from a drum machine in there also. Over all it is a strange but, good album."
5,Nice try but.....,"OK, so this is an excellent performance. Question is: Is it great?? Excellence and greatness and 2 different things. For an excellent performance, buy this. For a great performance (and Jon Vickers as an incomparable Enee), go back to the 1969 Davis set under Philips! The golden age of singing is not over but the golden age of the heldentenor is over. Read my lips: Renee Fleming fills the Strauss and Mozart gap. Gheorghiu fills the Puccini and Verdi gap - plus Massenet. Jane Eaglen can fill the heavy Wagner and Strauss gap. Mattila can fill the Salome gap and other dramatic roles like Fidelio. BUT nobody today can replace Jon Vickers."
2,"A good read-through, but that's all","I was completely shocked and disappointed by this recording of ""Les Troyens."" Despite an insufficient Dido in Josephine Veasey, Davis' earlier recording has life and drama. This one is brisk but unemotional, cleanly sung and played but totally lacking in drama. All of the voices (Heppner included) sound as if they are reaching for something but not finding anyone there but, more startling, Colin Davis' conducting has no dramatic feel or forward impetus despite (or perhaps because of) the brisk tempos. You would do much better to buy the old 1969 recording with Veasey and Vickers or, better yet, the early-'80s Met video with Jessye Norman (Cassandra), Placido Domingo (Enee) and the late Tatiana Troyanos (Dido) in one of her greatest roles."
2,Hoped it was better,My husband heard one song of this album on the radio and ordered the CD. He was disappointed.
4,worth waiting for....,"I was looking for inexpensive patio chair covers that were a nuetral color and not made of cheap vinyl, these fit the bill and they look great on my deck. They were on backorder and I am glad I waited for them. In fact my mom likes them so much she is going to purchase them, too. Not sure how well they will hold up and how good they will look after a a few summers and winters, but it was worth the investment to protect my chair cushions. Now I can stop pulling them in and out of the garage and leave on the deck where they belong."
5,Better than I thought they would be!,Love the Hearth & Garden patio chair covers we got. Very good quality material and workmanship. Just hope my dog doesn't chew them up!
1,Lasted only 1 year,"I purchased 2 patio chair covers by Hearth and Garden (Model Tri-000393)the end of May 2010 through Amazon. The material seemed substantial as though it would last a long time. I was extremely disapointed when I picked up the patio chair during spring cleaning (end of April 2011) and the patio cover ripped--a big rip. When I began to pull the cover off, it ripped again in a different spot. I wasn't being rough with the cover. I would NOT order these covers--you would be throwing your money away unless you only expect the patio covers to last 1 year. I also ordered 2 patio chair covers (the Veranda Collection #78932) by Classic Accessories through Amazon. Those patio covers have stood up to the local elements to date. I am pleased with the patio covers by Classic Accessories so far. I live 18 miles from the Atlantic Ocean. It is very humid during the summer and last winter was unusually cold for this area. I have lived here for 40 years."
4,PW's Chair cover review,The chair covers are very nice construction and the fabric is quite sturdy. They do a great job of protecting my chairs from the weather and the birds. They withstood the heavy winds and rain of Hurricane Irene that hit our area this past weekend. The only criticism I have is the tie down system - which is a velcro closure around a leg. The velcro did not hold for me so took other precautions to prevent wind damage. I would recommend this product.
1,Lasted 4 months,"All 4 covers I purchased developed mildew and cannot be cleaned. Very disappointed at the quality, have to throw them out and shop for a better product."
4,Just Right!,"I have been very happy with this chair cover. Has held up well, keeps my chair from undue weathering in cold,wet weather, and cats love to pop under it for a nice cozy nap!"
5,This is very powerful stuff!,"Jack Nicholson is superb, this is surely one of his finest roles. I was less impressed with Danny de Vito, but the story moves at a fast pace and one's interest is never lost. This seems to run very close to the actual historical events and the booklet included with this disc is extensive and well written. Most of the action takes place in low light or at night, despite this the picture quality is very good, the sound and subtitles excellet and the extras worth a look. Danny de Vito's speech I felt was way over the top but the rest were OK. An outstanding movie."
3,Worth a look,"The film mixes fact and fiction around the events of Jimmy Hoffa's life in full detail. Nicholson is great, and Devito isn't bad. The best praise that I can give this movie is that it doesn't attempt to glamourize Hoffa, or portray him as a saint. This is strictly storytelling, and it's pretty interesting stuff. You can see how Hoffa's life begins too unravel. The theory tacked on at the end serves as a suitable finish to this good, but not great film."
2,Very average,Jack Nicholson was alright in this film but Danny De Vito wrecks the film.he brings no emotion to this film what so ever.it should have been a good movie especially a story about Jimmy Hoffa.but instead it's very forgotten.
2,I Didn't Get It,"I'm not quite sure what I saw: the movie jumped from time capsule to time capsule: it presumed a lot of knowledge from the viewer. It is a disinterested and hurried attempt to try to piece together a coherent view of one of the most vicious and self-serving figures in American public life. Hoffa was no hero to anybody.Besides, I know where he really is."
3,Better 15 Years Later,"I remember the great hype that surrounded the release of ""Hoffa"" a decade ago. Perhaps the hype made this film seem disappointing to me at the time. Seen years later, ""Hoffa"" is better than I recall, but it remains a flawed film. The most interesting part of the film is the back story involving the rise of the Teamsters. Director Danny DeVito shot ""Hoffa"" in a dark, gritty atmosphere that seems like a documentary. Jack Nicholson looks amazingly like the real Jimmy Hoffa but I found his performance overcooked and too similar to the role he played in ""A Few Good Men"" the previous year. But the biggest flaw is too much dramatic license. No one knows Mr Hoffa's real fate: he may be buried in a football stadium, at the bottom of a river, or made into IHOP sausage. Instead of this, we get an ending that is too pat and hard to believe."
1,What the ????,"I may be confused, but I think these movie descriptions and reviews are all about the wrong movie. I have a copy of ""Hoffa - The True Story"" which is an A&E documentary from 1992 Hosted by Peter Graves. It is not the same as the DeVito/Nicholson movie ""Hoffa"" by 20th Century Fox."
4,Great Man,Being a Teamster I have heard that this movie is fairly true to the events it represents. But Mr. Hoffa did not use foul language as depicked in the movie. Do to lack of dialogue the writers do an injustice to the true character of a Great Man.
2,"""Cue the Short Gangster!""","It's important in watching this movie to ignore the fact that Danny DiVito plays a gangster. ...Any gangster, whether a real one or a Hollywood gangster, would double-over with laughter were they to see a fellow gangster not just as *short* as Danny DiVito but as comically-built as Danny DiVito.There's a scene where Danny DiVito roughs up a nightclub owner -- twice his size. ... Is this what's meant by the audience ""suspending its belief""?Danny DiVito is about as scary as a gangster as my Aunt Tillie is wearing a Dracula mask.As for the movie, Danny and Company take a decidedly sympathetic attitude toward Jimmy Hoffa. Never mind the sort of fellow James R. was: HE HAD POWER! ... And he was fairly short.What more could our boy Danny want in a hero?"
2,Boring,"I used this text for my developmental class. For the first couple of weeks I followed the author's recommended strategies at the end of each chapter; however, my students soon found those tasks quite boring: so we improvised and came up with our own critical thinking strategies. Our own way of doing things was much more successful. I regret having asked my students to buy this book. You can find much better texts on the market: texts that are more inspiring and more useful for fostering critical thinking skills."
5,My summer vacation,"I'm planning on going to a family reunion for the first time. After getting this altas, I wish I had more time to explore all the neat places listed... I'm just going to have to visit Missouri again, and again..."
4,Powerful first album; let's hear more from Barbara Keith.,"I bought the CD based solely on the Amazon.com audio, and as much to say ""thanks"" for all the freebies as anything else. I expected those two cuts to be the best on the album. Nice surprise to find out it is a solid album. Best original lyrics and voice I've stumbled onto since hearing John Prine's first album many years ago. When I got to the autobiographical (I presume) ""Odessa,"" and heard the way Barbara sang the lyric, ""Daddy, you oughtta hear your little girl sing,"" I said, ""I am writing a review. There'a a LOT of people oughtta hear his little girl sing."""
5,What a find!,"One of the best CD's I've picked up all year. Better than T.Petty, Counting Crows, Bowie, and several big names. I buy 100 discs a year and this is easily one of the best surprises I've ever had the pleasure to luck into.Sort of a Breeders-type sound, but tighter.Can't recommend highly enough."
5,I totally agree,"Listening to this cd is actually quite a devastating experience. Not for the faint-hearted, I should add. It's all in there... and much more. This recording surpasses time, style and romanticism. A recording from beyond.Oh Lord, how much I wish I'd been there, that November evening, in Münich.Buy it without any hesitation at all."
5,OMG,"This DVD is fabulous!! I typically run 3-6 miles a day and don't do weights at the gym cause I don't like people watching me (lol) and I was looking for something that would help build my muscle tone. This was totally the answer!!! The instructor is great at motivating. Make sure you are an experienced exerciser, this is not for a beginner as even I was exhausted throughout some portions of the DVD. Great, great, great!!!"
5,The Best!,"I like this DVD the best of the ones Jari did.It's like circuit training between the cardio and weights.The moves are easy enough to follow along to. It's also challenging.It's doubtful that I would burn 1,000 calories doing it, but, it's still an awesome workout! :) I highly recommend it!"
4,Ripped 1000 DVD,"I thought this dvd was great as I wanted something that would burn a lot of calories. The only negative was I din't realise that you would need a step to enhance your workout and although they give you options without one, I think you would burn more calories with one. My only other negative would be that the stomach exercises at the end didn't go for very long. It definately gets your heart rate up."
1,"1000 calories? Yeah, right...","I was highly disappointed by this video, particularly because I feel that the description and reviews were misleading. Don't be fooled - this is a STEP AEROBICS video. Several reviewers said that you could get a good workout without the step. While it is true that there are modifications offered, it basically amounts to marching in place or jumping jacks. For some people the heavy emphasis on the step may be fine, but I hate step aerobics (hello 1980s!). Also, I didn't find the workout challenging at all, and I find it very hard to believe that anyone could possibly come close to burning 1000 calories."
3,Nice combo of cardio and strength training,"This is my fourth RIPPED DVD and I was somewhat disappointed. It just didn't work for me compared to the previous ones, especially on muscle exertion and cardio. It as a good idea to have the alternating of cardio on the step and strength training & high reps, though."
1,Boring!!!!:(,"Oh my gosh that was the most boring exercise video I've done in years!Don""t be fooled by the title and flashy picture on the cover.Also no offense to Jari but she looks really creepy in these and not how I would ever want to look like.Keep looking there are alot of good ones out there."
2,good work out but too long,good work about but one hour is too long for me. I need a more condensed workout that can produce result in about 30mins
4,I love Jari but she shouldn't do Cardio,"My wife and I got this product after using the Chiseled DVD. We found that one to be challenging and effective. The pulsing and isolated body party segments really hit the mark.This DVD does a fairly good job in the weightlifting department as well. There are some different movements (i.e. hang clean and side lunges) that are nice variations.The issue I have are the cardio segments in between. 1.) They're not challenging 2.) they're not creative 3.) they're pretty annoying.What they do help provide is extended rest periods.Overall, the workout is strong enough to make up for the Cardio sections short comings."
3,I HATE the Segment Descriptions!!,"About 2 minutes after you've begun, there's a description of what's next and then you're into the next exercise. I'd prefer to have the instructor lead right into the next exercise move instead of making me stand there for 20 seconds waiting for the next exercise. To top that off, most of the times the next exercise requires an adjustment of the stepper. Ugh!! There's not a continual flow, which is what I'm used to. Other than that, the video gives a good workout."
5,get ripped 1000 calorie burn,"I love all of jari love's videos. this one is great too. I am naturally very muscular and i wanted a leaner look instead of being bulky. i have really seen an improvement in my muscle tone ( much leaner,body fat percentage as well as my overall energy has also improved.This is a tough video,you will sweat alot, but i love a challenge when it comes to exercise. i like how you can choose different workout sets from the video, incase you dont feel like doing all 70 minutes. If your on a platue with workout videos or you arent seeing the results you want. this is definetly a video to try."
3,Not for those with bad knees,I would have rated this higher but the next day my knees really hurt. So i am ordering slim and lean which doesn't appear to have the cardio. Also very minimal abd workout on this dvd. I really like the set up with the modified workout and she is very easy to listen to and to follow. I like the weight lifting segs very much will let you know how the slim and lean worked out
3,Pause,"This is a good work out, in which you burn many calories. The downside for me is that they don't cue the moves or tell you that you need to change the position of your step, which is a common occurence throughout the work-out. I find myself hitting pause and/or rewind quite frequently.Not to discourage as you will sweat!!"
4,Overlooked,"Even though they were probably signed in the ""next Nirvana boom"" this album is fanatastic. Spend the two bucks and be rewarded!"
4,Royal Doulton dish review,A little smaller than I expected but arrived in mint condition and was a nice item for the price.
4,Works well,Works well for the way I use it on my Shopsmith. Expect it to be better when I get other parts for my Shopsmith.
3,Distracting markings in this Kindle edition,"The story was typically Victorian, but interesting. My problem with the download was that every few pages I'd see a summary of how many ""highlighters"" had occurred on a particular sentence. Nothing to do with me, and I have no idea why these notations had to show up on the downloaded copy. I guess when something's ""free,"" you get what you pay for."
4,Disfigured text,"Mrs Henry Wood's novel itself doesn't need any recommandation: generations of readers have literally devoured it. My rating however is valid only for the novel in itself.What I should like to comment upon is the edition -- and here my rating is just 2 -- published as a volume of ""Everyman's Library""...The text is disfigured by dozens...of misprints -- from a philological point of view, this edition is just useless.The volume is out of print at the moment. This should be welcomed by the editors as an occasion to correct those numberless misprints. If they don't do so, there is only one comment possible on their edition: forget it."
4,We're an Arizona family,"Although Rhyolite is in Nevada, it could be any of the mining towns out here. We live near Goldfield, and it parallels the boom and bust of that gold-town-turned-tourist-trap.The rhythm seems off at first, but then if you read ""coyotes"" as ""KAI-yotes"" (silent e) instead of ""kai-YOTE-eez"" it comes together better.Great woodcut illustrations -- really beautiful book."
5,Nice children's book,We ordered and read this after visiting Rhyolite. Really helped explain to the kids what happened there.
2,High Entertainment Value,"I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes. In fact, I gave it to a sociology PhD candidate studying Chinese culture for a good laugh. I regret parting with it because it is quite a unique artifact, being quite comprehensive in its stereotypes of various Asian nationalities. Nevertheless, I can see the value of the book for those completely unfamiliar with Asian culture and desperately grasping for some way to categorize what seems to be inexplicable behavior, since the first response to unfamiliarity is to attempt to build categories to group and generalize. As such, I might recommend it, but only with the caveat that its contents should not be taken as authoritative."
5,An absolute must for doing business in Asia,"I lived and worked in Asia for over 8 years. Fortunately, I read it years ago while still there. I found this an invaluable aid. Ms. Chu does a remarkable job in explaining the subtle differences between the various cultures to the Western mind. I wrote this today because once again, I have recommended it to a work group that has interest in Asia. It is timeless."
4,An interesting read,"This is a frank discussion of the Oriental mind-set by an Oriental living in the US. I found the historic context quite fascinating. I had heard about the ""The Art of War"" and it was nice to get some background as well as a summary. I particulary liked the historic illustrations of use of the strategies.Insights into business etiquette, social hierarchy and what to be aware of in each of the regions is given.Since the book was written (1990) the economic miracle of Japan has stalled, so it would be interesting to get an update as to how the attitudes of workers may have changed in the intervening period where job security is no longer assured."
3,Oh Please,"While most of these books tend to drone on about what has already been printed previously, there is a nice mix of culture and specific application that makes this book work. Anyone with domestic negotiation experience could probably do just as well with the following, however.Look, if you want to negotiate with Asians, it is not that difficult. First, don't treat them like they are idiots. A lack of native English does not mean they are stupid. How good is YOUR Chinese, or Korean? Second, understand that they are motivated by many things, JUST LIKE YOU. The key is what do they want - short-term profits in foreign currency? Long term business contacts for down the line when they expand to a foreign branch? Maybe Tech transfer? Third, who is pulling the strings, and what are the limitations to your contacts negotiating power? Everything else is no different than your own country: think of ways to expand the pie, think of their perspective, blah blah blah.This was a good read."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"I have a keen interest in asian culture (My wife is Chinese)and I have read other books that give westerners insights into theasian mind. This one is by far the best I've read so far. I just finished reading it - I am going to reread it from the beginning again.I think that to categorize this book as a `business title' is an injustice - though focused on doing business with asians, this book does much more. I would recommend it to anyone interested in eastern culture and how it contrasts with western culture. If your a westerner doing business in the asian market, you can't afford to not read this book."
5,For those interested...,"This is a must read. Exceptional coverage of the topic and even adds a bit of humor here and there (""Berlin for lunch bunch""). Within the subject this book is worth the five stars."
4,60528,"This is similar to Larry Tart's Price of Vigilance including a photo of aircraft 60528. Larry's book was specific to one incident and Mr Burrows covers other incidents. As a former recon aircrew member, these books were especially interesting. I recommend it to all who are interested in this type of spycraft, which is still ongoing and vital."
3,electronic warfare,This is an air force view of electronic recon during the cold war. There is very little US Navy information. But a reminder of what we did and why. Military recon Geezers will find this interesting.
4,A valuable illumination of US surveillance,"Despite periods of wavering between factual succinctness anduncertain verbosity, this work provides a much needed insightinto the little known activities that have been quietly employedby our government for over a half century."
5,"speed, transition, flow...like Steve Caballero at the Del Mar Skate Ranch Circa 1983","The lead singer, Keith Morris, started this band as well as Black Flag (Nervous Breakdown), but this first and best release of the Circle Jerks is a far superior album than any of the Black Flag albums. However...""Wild in the Streets"" (from album of same name) is my favorite ""Jerk"" song.Dr. Brown certifies this CD as ""Bitchin""!Don't be lame buy the cd....14 songs in about the same amount of minutes...""That's how long the inspiration lasts"". Near seamless transition between songs leaves you with a satisfying dose of music. Play it loud mothers love this band!"
5,an undisputed classic,"""Group Sex,"" don't we all fantasize? Take this and go with it. As long as it would take for you to satisfy that ""deviant"" sexual appetite, this CD takes you there and beyond - spewing with satisfaction.The Circle Jerks are a hallmark of eighties punk music. This CD just absolutely reeks of it. It's fast and furious. Just one thing that is slightly unusual, you can understand the mad, raving lyrics. It's a pleasure.This album is probably not well known these days. It's unfortunate.You like punk? You'll love this CD."
2,Not much to it,"Its punk all right but I don't feel there is much to this album.All the tracks are very short ,less than 2 minutes. After listening to the album for a little while I can't pinpoint one song that I really like."
4,Sexcellent!,"When I was still living at home I had a Circle Jerks shirt that said ""Golden Shower of hits"". My mom always hated it. At age 15 I don't think I knew what a golden shower was. Years later her hatred was more understandable.I'll keep this short, much like the album. Classic punk rock. Simple and energetic. A similar sound to Minor Threat or early Black Flag, which makes sense since the original BF singer started this band. It's an album I always bring to parties so I can walk in and say ""who's up for some Group Sex""?"
2,Barely worth it,"First off, as soon as I opened the case to look at the discs, it broke down the spine becoming essentially unusable. Second, every movie has Korean subtitles that cannot be turned off (even if you go into the ""setup"" menu item and select none).That being said, the transfers look acceptable and the price is hard to beat. Had I to do it over again though, I probably would NOT buy this. It's nothing more than a cheap knock-off."
2,illegal pirate version,this is a cheap korean pirated copy.Wondering what to do as i am now in possession of an illegal copy?
2,"don't get it, music listed on track is incorrect","now that the price is reduced, I feel even worse, music listed on track is incorrect, waste of money and time"
5,Great!,"Two of the best products in one package - what else could you ask for? I mainly wanted this HITB because of the Denon receiver and BA speakers. The sound is excellent when paired with the receiver and speakers. The only downside I saw was the lack of HDMI - but at the time when I bought this (2007), HDMI was a emerging standard, so I really can't complain.Excellent product!! Oh - think about replacing the DVD player, it's okay and doesn't play burned back-up copies of any kind."
3,Okay for traveling,"I don't really like this product. The lanolin on each pad didn't really do much. Some didn't even have lanolin. The only thing I like about it is that it's individually package therefore, I use it as a spare pad in my diaper bag."
3,"Great idea, too bulky","For those early nursing days, these breast pads are a nice option. The lanolin is built right into the pad. I found them to be too bulky. The added pressure of the extra bulk made them a little uncomfortable for me. The paper-like edges also had a tendancy to crease and poke me.I had much better success using Lansinoh products. They make a special ultra-sensitive pad which Amazon doesn't sell. Just put the Lansinoh lanolin cream directly on to the their pad. I couldn't have continued breast-feeding without their products."
3,Great Value... but itchy!!!,"I purchased these mainly b/c of the price piont and liked the fact that they are lanolin treated(definetly a plus) BUT,I have to say... they are very itchy or maybe my skin is just very sensitive post pregnacy.The design is contoured to fit very well in to nursing bra and they hold in moisture...although Im not sure if I will place another order for them again.For the price they are worth a try!"
5,Worth the extra cost,"These breast pads are thin and absorbent, and the lanolin has made a noticeable difference to my skin. I wear these during the work day so I don't need to bring my tube of lanolin with me to get the benefit.I've tried Johnson's, Medela, and Lansinoh breast pads. Of those three I preferred the Johnson's, which are quite thick but didn't look bunchy when under a thin shirt like the other two did. But they still saturated often. The First Years ones here are very thin, but perhaps because of the lanolin they don't end up saturated and heavy.I highly recommend this product and I feel it's worth the extra cost per breast pad. I still use the cheaper ones overnight but I'll be buying the First Years ones again soon!"
5,The Bean Home News,"This is one of the really great Freddy books, ocurring in the middle of Brooks' career. Written during the Second World War, there are mentions of rationing and scrap iron drives, but most children won't find these a distraction. This seems to be the first appearance of Freddy's nemesis, Herbert Garble, and there are the usual --unpreachy-- lessons, such as not to take onesself too seriously, and plenty of excitement. This is one of the many Freddy books that adults will enjoy as well. Gives one a great excuse to read to your child."
4,Lots to love in Freddy,"My almost six year old is a big fan of Freddy books. He likes me to read them to him as his bedtime story. I love that the language is slightly challenging, so he has been learning lots of new words. There are a couple themes that are a bit too strong for us, so I skipped a few sentences (like threatening to shoot Freddy and other animals). However, with those exceptions this is a great story. Love the book, love the message, and love the ending.This story is a great way to introduce children to the complicated world of politics (especially since we are heading into a heavy political season), but in a kid friendly way that will allow lots of discussion between parents and children.Wonderful story!"
4,Tracey Thorn,"This is Tracy Thorns best production yet, with several outstanding tracks. I hope she keeps it going!"
3,Tracey needs Ben,"I love EBTG. I love Tracey's voice and how she uses it.It probably isn't fair for me to judge this recording just from the snippets, but it seems to me Tracey needs Ben to make the magic."
4,more sophisticated electronica...,"Tracey Thorn has been on the cusp of the electronic music scene since I first started paying attention to her in the mid-nineties. This album is no exception. The music sounds very fresh, though owes a heavy debt to the revived ""electro"" sound, now very much in vogue. I'm happy she mostly steers clear of overly predictable ""House"" beats in lieu of a slightly left-field sound. Regardless, the bass runs deep, the synths are sexy and Thorn's voice still haunts. This a very good album."
5,A New Direction,"Typically whenever new creative ground is broken the result is a bit of an incoherant mess. The modern visual art world is a perfect example, where ""artists"" break new ground simply for its own sake. Tracey Thorn's new album, however, is quite the opposite and altogether ground breaking.The album is deliberate, intelligent, fresh and totally non-linear. The lyrics are thoughtful and poetic. The programming is completely original and displays an incredible amount of attention to the minutest of details."
5,a masterpiece of pop music....,"I can't say enough great things about this album. I've always been a huge fan of Tracey Thorn's voice, and EBTG, and this has become one of my absolute favorite albums. Don't miss this!"
5,Brings back a great era in time,"Where is the DVD ??? As a kid growning up in the 70's the music brings me right back to where I was at that time in my life. Mr. De Vito, get with who ever you need to get with and pump out this DVD real soon. The movie makes you laugh, cry, frightens you and makes you just love family. All the performances in this movie are awesome and would love to see where some of those actors are now these days .... I'd be the first in line to get this movie ...."
1,"Very Underated, Hard to find, Yet so good","I thought this movie was one of the best works of cinema I've ever seen. Danny Devito shines in his serious yet humerous role. Gary Senise is the creepy kidnapping bad guy and Resse Wittherspoon is so adorable as Karen, Jack's love interest. I felt so bad for Dylan when Jack put him down by the dogs, I was blown away by this toddlers performance. The plot was good lots of twists and turns, yet totally beliavable. This movie took ever thing you look for in a movie and put in one convient package."
1,USPS sux,"I did not get to see this movie because my mailman stole it. Oh, that's right. Stole it. My girlfriend moved out. He thought everyone did, so he just kept whatever he was to deliver at my house!!! If I had to do over again I would have sent it UPS, at least they are not scumbags."
1,Creepy & Confusing,I bought this DVD based on the reviews--boy did I goof! I thought it was creepy and hard to follow. Sorry I bought it since I didn't enjoy watching it.
3,Not bad . . .,"but didn't turn me on nearly as much as a lot of his other stuff. Pretty straight-up songs overall, nothing too wacky or extemely interesting . . . the big exception is ""Crash."" For me, ""Crash"" really stands out. ""I met my looooooooove at a funeral . . ."" . . . the rhythm and percussion on that song is so cool. It's a sort of melancholy tune but really bizarre. Love the spastic breakdown in the middle before the song recovers again.Note: This is coming from the point of view of a fan who really loves UH-OH and the Heads' NAKED, unorthodox views according to many reviewers on this site, so take my opinion with (at least) a grain of salt!"
1,Not a puzzle,"I was very disappointed with this product. This is not a puzzle. I was hoping for a fun way to give money as gift. However, there is nothing to figure out. The box closes and locks with little magnets inside, so in order to open the box, the instruction is to bang the box on the table to disengage the magnets and then you can slide the top part to open. You will have to bang it pretty hard many times so don't do it on your nice coffee table. In fact, do it on cement or tile because you need to hit it really hard. Then once you have it open, you'll need some tweezers to get the money out because the opening is so flat, you cannot get your fingers in there and the contents do not slide out."
1,Took a hammer to it!,"I bought this for my nephew so I could give him money for Christmas - in a creative way! I couldn't get the darn thing to open. So, I took out the hammer and the darn thing still didn't open. So, yes, this is a very durable item - unfortunately, too durable to use! I ended up throwing it away. Don't waste your money - it doesn't work."
1,Not as pictured,"This item is not as pictured. It has three ""cartoon"" fake holes on the front, rather than the nice border design shown in the picture. It's really tacky. I will returning the three that I bought."
5,Highly Recommended,"This album has its weak points, but I give it 5 stars because it is a _must own_ as an important influental work and, as far as many of us Christian Death fans are concerned, the only real Christian Death album. Before you buy ""best of rozz williams"" or any Valor CD, you should get this. The music is very punk/new wave. This stuff a good intro to Rozz's work because this album is typical of Rozz in that it's depressing and anguished, but its not as heavily so as some of his later stuff, like Shadow Project. Perhaps the weakest feature is something that a lot of us Christian Death fans are actually fond of: Rozz William's voice. You either love it or hate it. Even if you've never seen a picture of this guy wearing a wedding dress, hearing him sing will make you picture it. He sounds very draq-queen-ish and whiny and even little boy-ish. Somewhat like Dead or Alive meets Robert Smith (of the Cure)"
5,The Best DeathRock CD EVER!!!,The Cd of Only Theater of pain was the first Cd ever that got me to go to the darker side of music. When i heard thsi Cd it was awsome. Very meaninful and dark lyrics that Rozz Williams had made for this album. The other very beautiful CD is Ashes. He is the best most original rocker that i have seen. A from this point i have not heard a CD that can pass Rozz's masterpiece of Only Theater of Pain.
5,one of the best punk/goth albums ever,this is my favorite christian death album. it has a young rozz williams on vocals and one of the best guitar players to come out of the o.c. punk scene: rikk agnew.
4,Only C.D. you need,"There are 2 types of Christian Death fans. The ones who only like their first album (this one) and those that like everything else. This is the only studio album with Rick Agnew (Adolessents)on guitar. This cd is not gothic its death rock or punk. They changed to a more moody gothic after this one. The songs are very well done but not recorded well. Its a good cd but if you are expecting it to sound like other CD cds(except Invocations, which is a live album w/ the original members except the bass player) you will be in for a treat. Because this is the only Chritian Death album as far as I'm concerened."
3,"Cool, but not exactly my style","I have ntohing against this album, I like it alot, but itdoesn't have the replay value of 'Ashes.'It gets old faster, as alot of punkish stuff does, even Throbbing Gristle gets boring to me.Still, highly recommended."
4,Great Local Bike Resource,"This book is a great resource for Puget Sound mountainbikers. This book has great descriptions of the areas, although some have been overtaken by the urban sprawl. The descriptions include distance from Seattle, the terrain and a general ability rating. A great book."
3,Good but...,These tweeters sound good but they sent me one that didnt work..... If both of them worked it would made my car system sound alot better
3,EHHH...,"These tweeters look great and sound decent for cheap tweeters, but i hooked them up to a stock infinity jeep amp and one of them blew... maybe the impendence doesnt match the amp...idk but still not amazing"
3,"Good quality, doesn't fit","This is in fact a pair of tweeters, not an individual, and they looked like high quality speakers and housing. Unfortunately Amazon said they fit my car and they do not. They are roughly 4 inches in diameter with aluminum housing (which is not removable). The speaker itself looks to be about 1-1.5 inches, which would match my car nicely, but the additional material makes it impossible to fit in my door without cutting a new hole in both plastic and sheet metal."
2,A little small for a magnetic board,This board is on the small size for a toddler to use. The play scene magnets seem to be too big -- something is always falling off. If you are going to buy a magnet board look for something bigger.
4,Magnetic Board Review,"This is an excellent educational tool for teaching you little one letters and spelling. The edge of this board and the letters are made of wood and the letters are painted with bright colors. But I have 2 problems with this toy. First of all, the letters got scratch mark real easy. My kid plays around with those letters for a little while and they're like worn already !The second problem is small pieces of wooden might peel off from the side of the board which I think it might stick into the hands of the kid, be cautious!!"
5,Heroic and bitter-sweet,"A little mini-book from Knopf by the editor of Elle magazine who became a victim of the ""locked-in syndrome"" after a stroke left him paralyzed except for one eye. You can read it in an hour and yet you might be transformed. This is Johnny Got His Gun for real. Touchingly and beautifully rendered if you can stand it, the poor guy just lying there unable to even scratch an itch...And yet, and yet, he wrote this book. Of course it is heroic, and of course he does not invite pity or tell his tale to seem heroic. Rather Bauby just wants us to know what it's like being in his position. Since this is who he has become, this is his job, to inform us. He's still working. He's still got something to give to this world.What we can gain from this is a realization that there are all sorts of levels of existence, and who are we to complain?Beautifully translated from the French by Jeremy Leggatt."
1,Not good,"Did not enjoy this book. The whole story is composed of all the random thoughts that enter his head making it hard to follow. I'm a nurse on a neurology unit and thought it would be an interesting read and help me gain a better understanding of what these patients go through, but it wasn't that kind of book. He barely even recalled his family. It only mentioned his kids once or twice. Like I said the book is just full of random, bazaar thoughts and memories."
3,AN OK BOOK,"I SAW THE MOVIE WHICH WAS EXCELLENT AND WANTED TO GET THE BOOK TO GET A MORE INDEPTH PICTURE. HE HAD A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LET PEOPLE INTO HIS WORLD AND TELL US WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND CAN'T MOVE. HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THAT. AND HOW DO YOU GET FROM THAT PLACE TO A PLACE WHERE YOU ACCEPT AND ACTUALLY SEE BEAUTY IN YOUR LIFE. HE NEVER SHARES ANY OF THIS. HE RAMBLES ON AND ON (WHICH IS PRETTY HARD TO DO ""TALKING"" WITH ONE EYE) HE TALKS ABOUT PLACES HE HAS BEEN AND PEOPLE HE KNOWS BUT ONLY TOUCHES ON THE EXPERIENCE HE'S HAVING WITH LOCKED IN SYNDROME. WATCH THE MOVIE IT'S BETTER."
3,Intriguing but Disappointing,"Although the details of the story are enough to touch one's heart deeply, I found it hard to find sympathy for such an ugly mind. The main character, however talented and heroic he was to dictate his book by eyelash, was an very unappealing character."
5,Stunning Achievement,This offers stunning insights into life and into recreating a world when a previous world is lost. There are parts of this work that are so beautiful that a reader hates to keep going because lines are worth capturing for as long as possible.
5,Fascinating story,"This story is absolutely captivating. The author is a man who is unable to communicate except for his ability to blink one eye. The entire book was dictated in this manner after having suffered a stroke. I read this book from the mindset of a health professional and I found it to be very helpful for empathizing with the patient. It is important to remember that just because a patient cannot speak, does not mean that they are not fully in their mind. I think this book would be a fascinating and useful read for both health professionals and lay persons."
4,Finding the positive in the direst situation,"If you are a fan of biography, this is a must read. If you are amazed by the concept of a person communicating with only the use of their left eye, you will buy this book. And you will be amazed, not only at the author's perseverence, but at his positive outlook on life in spite of his condition. It is a triumph of the human spirit."
5,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"What a remarkable book. It's small, not lengthy at all, and I read it in one sitting. Then I read it again, and again! It it a totally amazing accomplishment by this doomed writer, this extraordinary, talented, charming, life-loving man, to have written this inspiring, touching book by blinking one eye at each correct letter shown him, and having it become this stunning account of a terrible tragedy. What a testament to his will and determination, to his intelligence and creativity. Anyone who reads this gorgeous book can NEVER indulge in self-pity ever again. I keep it on my bedside, and read randomly from it, from time to time, to remind myself how fortunate I really am."
5,"""Outstanding""",Truly a masterpiece! One of the most inspirational books I have ever read. A must read for any therapist or healthcare provider.
3,"I'm shocked by this man, but not his book!","Bauby is really a man of guts and also a patient of lots of patience to put all these words into his book. I will say that his courage really gives rise to my withering heart. However, I would rather not say the same comments to his book, for it's content is a little bit boring. Well, maybe it's because I'm a foreigner and don't know the delicate feeling of a Frenchman."
2,"awe-inspiring, great book to read time and time again","recommended to me by one of my teachers in physical therapy school, this book put everything into prospective for me. it taught me how to appreciate the little things in life and to never take anything for granted because you never know when that will be taken away from you. i have read this book many times and have given it to countless people and patients to read. of possible, i would give it 6 stars."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"At the risk of sounding like a creep, I don't get it. This success of this book is obviously a godsend for family left behind in this terribly moving, tragic story. Thank God for that. But I found myself feeling at once manipulated and guilty for feeling that way. How dare I look at someone else's tragedy so coldly! Well, I'm going to stand out here in the cold, because this is a manipulation of the highest order, and most of the people I know who read the book feel the same way. Still, buying the book is undoubtedly going to help the man's loved ones, so there's little harm in it."
2,Not a big impression. Sorry.,"Quite frankly, this was just not my type of book. I definitely feel compassion for Bauby. I think it is absolutely amazing he was able to dictate a book in this condition. I am not familiar with ""locked in syndrome"" and I admire Bauby for his determination under these dire circumstances. However, I am not a big fan of a book where the focus is more on metaphors and writing style. I think it takes away from the emotion that can be projected to the reader. It is a possibility Bauby hid behind the words and phrases and I do not blame him for this. This book just wasn't able to leave that big of an impression on me. I feel bad about that but not guilty."
2,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is terribly overhyped. Naturally it is a phenomenal undertaking for a disabled Jean-Dominique Bauby, but it is far from a quality literary work. It reads more like a moneymaking venture if it was intended to be published; or marketing it as a literary work was the moneymaking venture. I will see the movie though in the hope that it is different from the book. This book certainly would not lift up the spirits of a convalescing disabled person."
1,Depending on what you expect from the book.....,"When I learnt about Mr. Bauby's situation. I decided immediately that I have to read his book. I expected that I should be able to learn some lessons from someone who is approaching a final stage in his life. Lessons on what I should do or prepare when I still can. In this respect, the book disappoints me. There are very few lessons covered which we can learn from. What Mr. Bauby is trying to tell us is that the Butterfly (i.e. the mind) can still fly freely unrestricted by the paralyzed body. Except for some chapters, this book is just an ordinary book written by an ordinary writer who is in a perfect health. Depending on what you expect, the book might be a good inspirational source for anyone who is in Mr. Bauby's position."
4,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly: A Memoir of Life and Death,I thought this was a wonderful quick read. I saw the movie and couldn't wait to read the book. How amazing that in all his struggles he was able to write this book. It shows you that even without body function the amazing strength of his will can go on.
5,A life confirming read,"After reading this book, this mans account of his two years imprisoned in a body that will only allow him to blink one eye, I must daily reconfirm how fortunate I am to type this review and walk about freely.I cannot imagine anyone reading this without being profoundly affected by it."
4,amazing and terrifying,It is hard to imagine being in this situation. We are given an insight into a condition that makes us think what would we want given such a limited quality of life. I wish we could have heard from his family about their feelings and communication with their husband and father. It was incredible he was able to learn to dictate this book and credit to the women who so patiently helped to give us this short account of this tragedy.
4,Slip of a memoir,"Gorgeously written, quiet memoir. Beautiful observations of life pre and post-a,cident. Cant help but wonder how the author is now."
3,wish i liked it more,"I was so inspired by the premise, and I wondered what beautiful prose a man ""locked in"" would produce. Unfortunately, I found it average. The most inspirational part of the book was his willpower to write it, in his condition. It is also valuable to note how much he could think under the circumstances.His situation however, was not unique, though his case was more extreme than most.His life was not particularly inspirational - he seemed to live for fine cars and fine food and travel. A nice book, but probably more meaningful to his family and friends than the population at large.Look elsewhere for inspiration."
5,Small Book With A Large Impact,"A small book with a large impact.This is one of the best great books from a real thinker, one who could live in this mind using his emotions in the place of actions. And write a book in his head. This is what should be called a great IQ with excellent emotional intelligence to round it out. It is a shame that the world lost a man with his capabilities."
5,The best autobiography I've read in years,"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a bittersweet account of the life of the body and the life of the mind after a devastating brain injury. It is the best autobiography I've read in years. It lifts the reader's spirit and makes one confront the fragility of life. The writing is fluid and beautiful, reads like poetry."
4,worth the read,"This is a good book, with a very interesting and engaging story. In addition to that, I think it would be beneficial to read for those who may have a family member or friend who has suffered head trauma, because it helps to give insight into the thoughts and struggles of someone who can't communicate via traditional means. Too often we may view these people as less intelligent or unable to fully understand their surroundings. This book shows how very frustrating it is to convey thoughts when ""locked in"" but how wonderful it is to know they can still sense and appreciate the world around them."
4,acceptance of fate is his gift,"First, the story of this man communicating with the world by blinking his left eye is fascinating. The description of prioritizing letters based on their frequency of use in the French language is really cool.However, the real wonder in this book is Jean-Dominique's acceptance of fate. He is certainly not happy with it, and feels quite demeaned at times by hospital staff, but he keeps on going, and as a result we have this beautiful memoir that he shared with the world."
5,Amazing!,"Honest, reflective, heart-wrenching, but amazingly filled with life and hope! When I began this book little did I realize that it would be so uplifting."
5,"Creative, funny, and an all together GREAT movie!","Toys is an example of a well planned movie. I enjoyed it very much. Robin Williams fits the part of ""Leslie"" perfectly. This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever!"
4,"Visually superb, brilliant fantasy","This film is highly underrated. It certainly isn't for everyone, but for someone who can suspend their disbelief a little more than others, someone who can appreciate the ability of fantasy to make very profound points about reality, someone who likes whimsy, wit, and style, should definitely see this film. The writing is excellent, the acting is wonderful (remember, compelling is far more important than believable in fantasy), the set design is beyond words. If you don't ""get"" fantasy, then this movie will be stupid, boring, and a waste of time. But, I tell you, ""Toys"" is none of those to me. I love it to little little bits."
5,The most underated film,"Toys, is the most underated film and deserves more credit than most everyone gives it. This movie is full of symobilsm and cunning humor which is often unoticed by the average viewer. Robin Williams is absolutly brilliant and LLCOOL J does a surprisingly wonderful job as well. If you love Robin Williams' ""Under the breath humor"" then this movie is a must!"
3,Fun quirky movie,"Robin Williams and Joan Cusack are great cartoon-like characters in this surreal movie about a toy factory taken over by relatives without cares for the children or the toys. I thought this movie was fun and quirky, and more clever than the more high-tech recent movies along the same lines, such as ""Small Soldiers""."
5,This is a great movie. You'll probably hate it.,"This movie was panned, and disappeared from the theaters so fast it was a miracle I even saw it. The plot is kind of surreal -- almost like a fable. If you take the plot literally, you'll hate this movie, as did most people. If you're looking for a Robin Williams comedy, you'll definitely be disappointed.What you do get is a movie that is incredibly creative, visually and musically, with an incredible cast that all get it. It is a fun movie about good vs. evil (or joy and innocence vs. militarism), it can be very silly, and if you get into it you'll love it. I do."
1,Defective Filmmaking,"Willy Wonka meets Dr. Strangelove in this one-of-a-kind cinematic disaster. Writer-director Barry Levinson's longtime ""dream project"" emerges as a garish nightmare. The impressive production design wears out its welcome after five minutes while a talented cast sinks in the big-budget quagmire. ""Toys"" represents another unfilmable concept that somehow received the Hollywood green light."
1,It's a Dog... ARF! ARF! ARF!,"Watching ""Toys"" was like watching ""Teletubbies"" dumbed down for an audience of subhumans.Six Million Jews died in concentration camps during World War II. It took the combined forces of the free world to stop this genocide. Williams and the production company that made ""Toys"" are just closet nazis.Inasmuch as I watched this self-righteous piece of elitist garbage, I can say without any hestiation that if you believe that whole nations would be better off in the hands of two-bit despots, then maybe you'll be stupid enough to accept the premise of this unadulterated nonsense.Pray for peace, but never give in to evil."
1,"How much did they spend on this garbage? Worst Levinson film I've seen since ""Envy""","I actually wish they had given us director commentary on this disc because I would have listened to a little of it just to see what Barry Levinson was thimking and I would cross my fingers and hope he would blame the whole thing on a really bad drug trip. Take a look at the man's filmography and tell me if you think this absolute disgrace belongs there. Worse, he wasn't alone, SOMEONE ELSE liked the idea enough to co-write it. Everyone else can blame a large paycheck, but Levinson actually came up with the idea. This is one of the most beautiful terrible films I ever seen, if they took one tenth of the imagination they put into the set and toy designs and invested it into the screenplay they might have had a movie."
1,Toys~BORING!,"This was definitely not one of Robin Williams better films. It was not funny and could not hold the attention of my children or myself for that matter. A total snooze fest. Now I know why I had not heard of it prior to seeing it on amazon. Save your money people, sorry RW."
2,BELOW PAR COMEDY,"Sadly this comedy misses it's potential in a big way. Robin Williams stars in this eccentric and feeble comedy, playing Leslie Zevo, the nephew of the general (Michael Gambon) who inherits his brother's toy factory and so decides only to manufacture war games, tanks and guns. So Leslie (Robin Williams) decides to stop his uncle by turning the toy shop into a war zone. You will gasp at the extravagent, spectacular sets and costumes but apart from that there's very little interest. The film limps along at a sluggish pace and has no real sense of direction. Robin Williams does his best but he is one of his weaker roles here. A rather nondescript affair."
2,Painfully bad!,"Yes, this was director Barry Levinson's pet project. He wrote the script in the 70's; but didn't have the clout to get it made until the early 90's. Some pet projects, however, are better just left on the shelf. Despite a top flight director, a marketable and whimisical star, marvelous sets, and one of the most unique trailers in movie history, ""Toys"" was a failure.Why? Well, the script with its anti-military message might have worked in the post-Vietnam 70's; but it was woefully out of sorts with the post-Gulf War 90's. Also the film is almost entirely a lesson of style over substance. The sets are great; but there is little going on within them except Robin Williams being really, REALLY annoying. ""Toys"" is dull, pointless, bewildering, anachronistic, and just painful to watch."
1,AVOID at all costs,"I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and really regretted it. I wish I could have that hour and a half of my life back. Even Robin Williams couldn't save this dog of a movie. I sat there thinking, I have no reason to care about any of these characters. This movie earns the rare distinction of being a movie I didn't walk out on, but really wish I had. As I write this, it's been 18 years and I still remember what a stinker this movie was. Save yourself. Run for the nearest exit immediately."
1,Dreadful is not a strong enough word...,"This is the only movie that I walked out of, ever. The movie is non-sensical and boring. The plot is horrible. Don't waste your time. Avoid this with a 39-and-a-half foot pole!"
3,Not his best work,"One thing about Robin Williams is that he never saw a part he didn't like. Toys did not gain very good revieews and it doesn't age well.However, the DVD is worth seeing for the title music and introduction. ""The Closing of the Year"" is a song that needs more seasonal play. The entire opening sequence makes up for the strange story that follows."
4,Very Imaginative,"I want to give Toys 5 stars, and it is one of my favorite movies, but something about it makes me say it's only a 4 star movie. I'm not sure what it is.The continuity seems a bit jumpy at parts, but just because the film is so imaginative and fantastic, continuity doesn't really seem to matter. The imaginative visuals alone make the movie great. It doesn't need anything else.This movie is high quality all the way. I recommend that everybody see it at least once. I think it's in the perfect format. It's perfect for a movie screen, but wouldn't work at all if it were a book. It's an artistic endeavor that uses the strengths of its format to produce the best entertainment possible. Watch it, and just soak in its creativity."
3,"War is bad... uh, thanks for the tip...","While the anti-war, anti-violence message is always a worthy one, I was disappointed with the sloppy and clumsy execution in this movie.While the movie is visually captivating, there are times when the script becomes infantile - almost as though Levinson and Williams were so busy slapping each other on the back during the shoot that nobody bothered to monitor the quality of the dialogue.Surely they could have been imaginative enough to suggest the phallic nature of weaponry without having at least two actual references to the size of the male organ. It is that very childishness and lack of vision that stops me giving this movie five stars.Yes, Joan Cusack was absolutely superb, as she aways is.Ironic that an anti-war film maker should end up making a box office 'bomb'."
5,It is one of my all time favorites!,Share this one at Christmas time. There are some great sets that have never been shown in any other movies. The music is great.
3,"The stupidest Robin Williams movie, but not the worst...","Robin Williams is very funny. Joan Cusack is always goofy. Jack warden always shines. But this movie featuring those talent is one over stuffed movie. This only has about 1 belly half every 30 minutes, but the script seems to keep it going. Robin Williams doesn't look too happy, but Joan Cusack does. playing brother/sister they together must stop his evil brother from making dangerous war toys. Micheal Landon plays the evil brother, and Jack Warden plays his father. Very long. Not for young children. Naming this movie Toys was bad. The movie talks about sex and there is gore. Very cooky."
2,Average,"Average eyeliner, nothing out of the ordinary.I don't have any good or bad opinion on it as this works same as any other eyeliner I've picked up from a local drug store."
5,A really good introduction to disability politics,"This book is written in an easy-to-read style by a journalist who has covered disability issues for many years. It explains how he came to see that disability is a civil rights issue, just like racial or sexual discrimination. And it provides a very interesting history of the American disability movement in particular."
5,Fantastic. Everyone must read this book.,"This book changed my view of the world, of people with disabilites, and of people in general. Everything I thought I knew about disabilities went right out the window. Not only is it a real eye-opener, it's also a fantastic read -- interesting, funny, heart-breaking, rivitting, inspiring, earth-shattering -- everything you would want out of a good book. Everyone should read this book -- and then give it to all their friends to read (I have)."
4,A Classic,"This is a classic on Mexican cooking, with first and second printings in 1958. Recipes and instructions are succinct, and there is little or no commentary on the dishes or their background.I give this 4 stars, as Diana Kennedy's ""The Cuisines of Mexico"", published in 1972, has become a more definitive source of Mexican recipes. Kennnedy's book also has simple recipes, and also has superb hints on cooking, and gives a wonderful running commentary on the origin of the dishes, and suggestions on how to serve the dish. Kennedy's also has photographs.Newer books by Bayless and others have come forth since 1972, however both Zelayeta's and Kennedy's books have stood the test of time."
5,Shhh...This is the Secret!,"In every city, every day, most of us think we know what is Mexican cooking.We don't. This is the real thing. REAL food. Made with...Love. Yes, the Mexican Restaurant around the corner is nice, but just like the Chinese restaurants, there is a secret menu, only available to those who see beyond the...obvious. There is food like you only dreamed of.....and this is the book! You just thought you knew how to prepare Mexican. Well, prepare to rethink everything. REAL food, the real tastes. Just enjoy! And do not try to speak the language to your server (unless you want to be riduculed in the back room)!"
2,Very short life,I bought this phone about a year ago and it was fine for the first six months. It has been dying in the middle of calls lately and it finally just died for good the other day. It is not the battery - I replaced it. It is just a low quality phone.
1,Its Horrible,"I just bought this phone, and I have been charging it for three days and it still has no type of dial tone. It has a bit of static and it is hard to hear. I plan on returning it."
4,Denis Wick 7 Review,"Great mouthpiece. However, if your used to a smaller rim similar to an mc farkas, it may take some time getting used to."
2,This is not Country Music's 500 greatest!,"If you want to include the following records in a list of Country Music's 500 greatest singles:Atlantic city by Bruce SpringsteenHonky Tonk Women by the Rolling StonesQueen of Hearts by Juice Newtonand various other songs listed by Bing Crosby, the Monkees,Los Lobos,Merilee Rush and other ""pop"" singers, then this is the book for you. Otherwise I don't think the authors have a clue about ""real country music"". Texas musicians and records are virtually non-existant in this book and the authors like to ""sound"" politically correct on every review (who cares if a Jimmie Rodgers song was racist?).This book is full of ""fake"" country records and the reviews are weak. There is a book called ""The Stories behind Country Music's all time greatest 100 records"" by Ace Collins, it is all this book fails to be. Try out Ace's book if you want a good book on Country music singles. Skip this fluff."
3,SUNDAY MORNING LOOKING IN VAIN,"Like other of your reviewers, I found this book both enjoyable and baffling. Following the intentions stated by the authors in their introduction, I have listened to many of these selections with ""new ears"" and come away with new appreciation. Their #1 pick Sammi Smith's version of ""Help Me Make It through the Night"" is a good example but I'm sticking with their #2 ""Lost Highway"" is the all time greatest. The one thing that really confounds me and led to my reduction in rating is how in the world could they have ignored Johnny Cash's version of ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" not only from the 500 greatest but the alternate 100. John R. is well represented here as he should be but ""Sunday Morning"" was a landmark in his ongoing transformation to American Music God as well as serving as a breakthrough in the country musicworld for songwriter Kristofferson."
5,A David Goodis Masterpiece,David Goodis has created a masterpiece of hard-boiled fiction. The book opens in the midst of a suspenseful heist and never lets you off the roller coaster ride. Twists and turns abound until the last page. The story is both cinematic and poetic. Pyschoanalytical symbols combine with harsh realities creating a rare literary treat. One should not rest until every Goodis work is brought back into print. He is easily the most underrated American writer second only to Charles Willeford. Do not miss this one!
3,Book is great; cd's not so,"The book is very organized, with great details and fun exercises. But the audio portion is a bit tedious--has too much English instruction for how to complete the exercises, I would prefer more pure Spanish immersion."
5,In the Eyes of the Beholder,"as a person who has been close with the Strand family for a long time, i have to say that out of personal relations and out of knowing the full potential for paul and his family, this book is amazing. you have to remember that there is a face and a mind behind this camera, and the amazing talent that people must have in the first place to even be able to spot beauty in the everyday things. if you can take the time to look at the power of these photographs as a human being with a powerfully capable mind and not as a critic, prone to hang on every little detail instead of fully trying to enjoy the pieces in question, i can garauntee that you will be completely satisfied with this collection. in my mind it will always be stunning."
3,"LSO Great, Davis Surprisingly, Not As Much...","This has become a popular version; for obvious Reasons, LSO (my personal favorite symphony orchestra and usually can NEVER go wrong) and Davis, and players like Maurice Murphy. This is played fantastically, the quality of play is not in question. I just personally, dislike some of Davis's interpretations of the Planets. Mainly Mars, the temp is probably the quickest I've heard, a step too quick. Some versions can be slowww but this does the opposite. Thus sometimes the brass sounds clunky to me, due to the speed not the play. My fav parts are sped threw, the solo horns in middle and end. I hate giving this 3 stars, but, for me, not my favorite versions. I prefer Geoffry's and LSO's then by comparsion. HOWEVER - quality of play by LSO is nearly unmatched, so I can't say I won't listen, I do actually like Venus and Neptune a lot. But anyways, worth hearing and experiencing, but not my personal cup of space tea =D"
4,Holst: The Planets,"`Holst: The Planets' was introduced to me at a young age and over the years it has lost none of it's power or magic, even after repeated listening. It runs you through the gamut of emotions, from tranquil musing, to soaring jubilation, angry fired up aggression and lilted sadness and all in a short space of time. The skill and ability of the composer to affect the human spirit from such music can not be underestimated. This performance is wonderful and sits at the top of other recordings I have and if this is your first listen of this piece you can't go far wrong in starting here. A worthy addition to any classical collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Sports Psychology for athletes not psychologists,"This book is geared towards the athlete. A lot of the books on this subject are written like a doctorate thesis (maybe they are). This book is loaded with practical excercises and techniques that will help you improve your performance. If you have read any other sports psychology books, most of the theories described here are not new or ground breaking but are described in a very concise manner with plenty of examples. You can go through this book in a couple of days and then go back through it to pick up anything that you missed. I recommend this to any athlete looking to improve his/her performance."
2,More inspirational than step by step guide,"I wanted a step by step, tell me what to do and how to do it guide to attaining mental toughness and this book isn't it. It has lots of sports anecdotes, but wasn't what I expected."
3,Not my cup of tea...,"This is a hard book to rate-it really all depends on the reader. For me, it came off kind of as `Chicken Soup for the Athlete's Soul.' A little hokey for my tastes.The entire thing can be summed up in two sentences: 1: Keep an unfailingly positive attitude, and 2: Spend a bunch of time visualizing success. The rest is mostly not-so-useful expansions on those (admittedly useful) ideas or inspiring anecdotes about little choo choos that could. If you're looking for concrete meditation or mind control techniques, you'll probably want to look somewhere else.I'm not trying to be negative about the book. I think a lot of people would find it really inspirational and helpful. You just need to be aware of what it is and what it isn't before you buy..."
5,ITS IN THE HOLE !,"Begin like you want to finish, has helped sink more tough putts than any technique I've ever tried. The Mental Edge is full of useable techniques that improves your game quickly. THE BEST SPORTS PERFORMANCE BOOK ON THE MARKET AND AN ABSOLUTE FOR GOLFERS!"
5,Cook up success with DinnerOnTime!,"DinnerOnTime is a great book that lives up to its title with style! It is an excellent resource for anyone hosting a crowd for dinner, regardlesss of the occasion. The book is well-organized, comprehensive and logical. The beauty of DinnerOnTime is that Ms. Taubman understands that hosting a successful dinner party is about more than choosing the right menu;it's about the details, details, details! And, the author is meticuluous about the details,offering an endless potpourri of tips that save time, reduce stress and make success and sanity the outcome! She convincingly demonstrates that planning and organization can overcome inexperience and small budgets every time. Moreover, her recipes are wonderful and reasonable for people who have hectic lives! This book should be a standard in every family's kitchen!"
1,Degenerate Filth!,"Garbage and filth! Written by a lunatic, illustrated by an obvious madman and published by a crazed elf! The loose morals, poor dietary habits and odious hygiene of all concerned in this loathsome production are evident in every analyzable inch of what can only by definition be called a book. Burning is too good for this...thing. I wrote my Congressman asking for dispensation to place every copy of this vile concoction of type and images designed to soil the minds of our youth onto the next Space Shuttle for immediate launch into the heart of the sun. But I was informed that the Space Shuttle will never launch again. I blame The Ice Box Poems for this! We will never be rid of it or its degeneracy now."
4,"A fitting ""end"" ??","Wow so many negative reviews for ""Find Me""! I was really surprised, cause personally, I loved this book. I a huge fan of Kathy Mallory and all the books, and I think this, while not up there with my all time fav, (Flight of the Stone Angel), i think it was both fitting and satisfying. Like 'Stone Angel', i love the stories about Mallory's past, and this is no different. The ending WAS shocking, but it ties up heaps of loose ends. I for one, had never given Mallory's father much thought, only Cassandra.So do read it, it's worth it, especially to find out what happens at the end. While it doesn't have the excitment of the New York based novels, it's still an excellent read.Let's hope this isn't the last we see of Kathy Mallory!"
5,Number 9 and getting better all the time,"For those who love Kathleen Mallory, and who doesn't, this is the natural progression of excellent mystery, interpersonal relationships and the psychological growth of the main character. There is plenty of police work and lots of information about what to many of us is a classic landmark, Route 66.I've read them all and they just keep getting better."
4,Find Me,"I have really enjoyed all of Carol O'Connell's books and this one is no exception, though they have seemed a bit of a one-note lately with Mallory's character revealing some insight into the why's of her personality but not exhibiting much in the way of personal growth. Even still, very entertaining mysteries all. However it will be very interesting to see what happens in the next one (if there is a next one) considering that a major mystery has been solved and should open up an entirely new avenue for this character."
2,pass on this,"I had a very hard time getting into this book. It starts okay, but quickly gets bogged down in to many people and off shoots. I didn't bother to finish it."
3,"I'm being generous with three stars, disappointing","This book was so disappointing. One reviewer wrote what I was also thinking, this book was all over the place. Mallory's character was more annoying than interesting. The supporting cast made the book bearable (especially the Finn Family and FBI Agent Berman), but I must admit it took me a week to read this book whereas with the others it took on average a day or two. Wait for the paperback, don't waste your money."
3,The Find,The Find began at a slow and dull pace but I know what's coming. The middle pumps your blood and makes you beg for more. The climax magnificent and usually not seen ahead. I just wish I could get through the beginning faster. Her books are very good.
1,Life is too short to read bad books!,"This is my first read of a Carol O'Connell novel so I don't know what the previous in the series were like. However, I'll never find out. I just couldn't follow this story; it was all over the place. Events were jumbled. Had I not read the end flap, I basically would have had no idea whatsoever what the plot was supposed to be about. O'Connell assumes the reader knows more than they do, I think. The writing was neither smooth nor particularily compelling. I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the ending as I never got there; I was too hopelessly lost in the poorly executed plot. Any book that it so poorly written that I cannot finish it gets one star from me. Unfortunately, I purchased this book new. Wish I could get my money back. Life is too short to read bad books!"
3,disappointing after all the rave reviews,"After all the glowing reviews in the paper, and being an avid mysterybuff, I was really looking forward to this novel. The beginningheld my interest, but by the middle of the book, I couldn'twait for it to be overe. Talk about no editing, and repetitionad nauseum, I couldn't wait for this to end. I don't like togive anything away in dealing with mysteries, but this turnedout to be a real disappointment."
4,Overall pleased,"I am a huge fan of the previous Mallory novels. I liked this one, but it seemed a bit different than the other Mallory novels, more like Judas Child. Really hoping that there will be another book and soon. The end left me wondering. I would love to see any new direction this would lead in, but I don't know if its meant to be wrapped up here."
3,Good mushy love story,"I was first introduced to Paul Gallico at a young age. The movie Lili was based on his short story Love of Seven Dolls. Since then I've read his stories off and on. ""The Lonely"" is about a soldier Jerry in World War II who has a sweetheart at home. He gets a few days leave and decides to spend it with a local RAF girl Patches. He explains from the get go that he is only interested in a fling. But through the vacation he changes his opinions on her, the plain Patches suddenly becomes beautiful. When the vacation's over Jerry realizes that he's in love. But telling his narrow-minded Suburban parents turns out to be a harder task than he thought.The book is short only around 120 so pages. It's worth a read."
2,Poor sound and range outweigh the useful features.,The features looked to be a great match but the audio quality was a complete letdown. There was a constant hiss transmitted to the other party unless I held the mute button. The phone would drop the connections or fail to answer when I walked more than two rooms away.I worked with the Brother help-line but none of their suggestions were successful.I returned the unit and bought a Uniden 2-line DSS.
2,Very good except the range is terrible,"This phone is almost perfect. It has all the features you might want, is easy to use, priced reasonably.Unfortunantly, it has the smallest range of any cordless phone I've ever tried. Even 15 feet from the base station my reception isn't perfect. At 75 feet it is unusable.Two caveats: I haven't checked the manual to see if there is a magic incantation that's required to get it to work properly. I have only played with two base stations and three handsets so I may have just had bad luck."
5,Now it's my turn.,"When I was a child, this book was at my Grandmother's house, and whever I went over there, I had to have her read this book to me. It was read so many times that it eventually fell apart. Now that I'm expecting my first, this is one book that we will not do without. It's such a simple, wonderful story of friendship, I don't know how this book isn't loved by everyone that reads it."
1,Where's the movie?,"You want a good tone-poem, buy a recording of Smetana's ""Ma Vlast"" - Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic do a great job on this piece. But this piece is really quite...well, lame. The whole piece (with the possible exception of the choral finale), sounds as though it is trying to line up with a bad version of ""Braveheart."" McCartney, although an amazingly good performer and one of the century's best songwriters, simply cannot hold his own in the Classical field. As Stravinsky once put it, classical music ""is a different fraternity."" And it is one in which McCartney does not cut it. If you like cliched movie music, then by all means buy this album, and you will like it. But I just do not feel that this piece has any meat that listeners can sink their teeth into."
5,A Beautiful Symphony!!! :-),"This is his best classical ""work as a whole of structure"", it builds, and uses itself in reference, it tries to cover Everything, and it does try Very well, it celebrates, it shows sorrow, it grows, it bursts.. NOT for anyone who doesn't like classical music.. it comes in a cardboard slipcase with a fairly good sized booklet!! i bought mine used, and saved $12.00, i reccomend you try to find one used, lots of people buy it just because of pauls name, and end up hating it because its classical.. :-)"
4,"difficult to rate, but buy the album for choral finale",There are great melodies here and some wonderful atonality. The music is catchy and the entire piece improves after several listenings. There are also awkward patches. A slightly better understanding of composition and structure would have worked wonders. Still there is the chorale finale. It has to be one of the most beautiful melodies that this gifted composer has ever written. One wonders how popular this piece would have been if it had been written 30 or so years ago and recorded by Macca and his former associates.
5,Beautiful music,"Another of Paul McCartney's composition of classical music. Lovely,relaxing to listen to."
1,"Can you say ""H-U-B-R-I-S""?","Why was this recorded and released (while many much worthier pieces are not)? Presumably because Paul McCartney's name is on it. Why was it (heavily) publicized? Presumably because Paul McCartney's name is on it. Why is it getting (some) favorable reviews? Presumably because Paul McCartney's name is on it. What did I expect? Well, I hoped at least for a catchy tune or two. No such luck. Nothing here I'd call a melody or tune, catchy or not.(This is a piece with a program, by the way--a program based on an ostensible epic poem in free verse. In other words, it does not rhyme and is not metered, but it omits articles, prepositions, and verbs to show it is nevertheless ""poetry"". It can be summarized thus: Giant fiery asteroid collides with earth. Life evolves. Boy meets girl. Boy marries girl. Dan Quayle approves.)"
3,Tone Poem Misses Epic Proportions,"It's a nice tone poem, with a nice poem written about it. But not earthshattering. Not even earth shaking. Technically, it's well done, but it lacks soul. Considering the four classical elements, this is a work of Air, but lacks sufficient Fire, Water, and Earth to really connect and ground the story in power. Nevertheless, McCartney's work is enjoyable, even if it seems like a soundtrack without a movie.The performance cannot be faulted (by this layman's ear), and makes good background music for cranking out lines of computer code. This is to be expected from the London Symphony Orchestra.Unless you're a die-hard McCartney afficionado, this CD isn't required. Nice background music for Sunday brunch on the patio, or creating software. If you liked Fresh Aire 5, you may well enjoy this. But it's not at all mandatory."
4,McCartney's musical growth is reflected in this symphony.,"Uneven, Yes absolutelyChildish in places, also guilty..I don't know if McCartney meant the work in part as a musical autobiography of his growth into the classical field. The first time through, I thought he was letting us take his journey with him has he experimented with the different sounds of the orchestra, gradually finding his way and finally merging them into a wonderful finale. It wasn't until after two weeks of ridding around listening to the CD that I was able to read the liner. McCartney says he was showing the evolution of man. The parallel is stunning."
5,Beautiful!!!,This is spectacular coming from Paul. It shows all of his extrodinary talent in a one hour -and-fifteen minute symphony. I think it's absolutly beautiful!!!!!
2,better than the Oratorio,"McCartney works best in short form...some of his best songs like Admiral Halsey or Band on the Run are the skilled fusion of 2 or more melodies...McCartney and Lennon did this in a A Day in A Life...which is their magnum opus...however, Standing Stone just doesn't go anywhere until the finale...it may have made a good film score, but as a classical piece, it doesn't go anywhere...there are some neat melodic shifts here and there, and I give it 2 stars for the lilting finale...it is definitely a step ahead of the absolutley tedious Oratorio...I think that his next classical project, composed of several shorter works will prove to be the most listenable as they are not long ambitious works....we'll see...."
2,Grew on me slightly,"Umm, listening with your guts isn't exactly a good way to listen to music, in spite of what an earlier reviewer asserts.In contrast with my earlier, one star review, i had to add one more star. The piece as a whole still warrants the one star, I feel, but the chorale finale, helps this piece out - enough to raise the rating. This finale is proof that McCartney does have some very good ideas to share with the world in a classical context. My hope is whatever inspired him to write that finale will inspire him to write his next piece.There is hope for him - he may rise to being an excellent composer. We'll have to wait and see."
4,great buy,"The colors i got were not bad at all. I got a blue print that isn't too ostentatious. The top is a little too big for me and the bottoms are a little too high cut for my taste, but I just fold them over. For sizing, I am about a size 3/4 in womens and the small fits pretty decently."
3,Is this the Galaxy Edition,"I would really, really like to know if this is (as shown in the picture) the Galaxy Edition of volume 9."
5,Superhero 101,"Mouravieff gives you hints and glimpses of an ancient philosophy lost through time and buried by the powers that be. His work along with Carlos Castenda and Georges Gurdjieff elucidate a philosophy that holds the potential of granting man freedom, in its truest sense.There are many philosophical elucidations as well as practical meditative excercises that will allow the reader to discover and know more about themselves.It's no free lunch, and can only be understood and executed by a few, are you one to try?"
2,research,"When I first read volume one I found it good enough and interesting to order v. 2& 3.Then I came across a passage which seemed to say if you're gay forget this path. Great confusion replaced my interest, and I put the book down for a while.Then I discovered a book by Patterson called Taking With The Left Hand. In it he discussed Mouravieff as a bit of an imposter. He did not actually study with Gurdjieff and may have actually plagiarized Ouspensky. His addition of courtly love was an attempt to create a 5th way which Gurdjieff did not teach, and his use of the phrase 'eastern orthodox tradition' may be based on a misunderstanding of something Gurdjieff did say, indicating a form of Christianity older than Egypt, not the Eastern Orthodox brand.So before buying this, research Mouravieff and maybe read Patterson. Being gay, I cannot get past that certain paragraph and so may never read v. 2 or 3."
4,Good textbook,It explains everything clearly. I have another finance book with the same type of content but this one is definitely easier to understand. Recommend it.
4,Seller send the book quick!,"I ordered this book for class, and was lucky enough to have a seller who sent the book quickly..."
4,Corporate Finance: A Focus Approach,It is a good book but the the book was not in the conditions indicated by the seller.
4,Great condition,The book was in excellent condition when I received it. I also received the book in a very timely manner.
5,Good Book,The book is easy to understand. The authors present the material in a way that is easy to follow and comprehend.
1,"Unusable, very unpleasant","The formatting is deplorable: typos and pagination problems, no separation of entries, virtually unsearchable, unbrowse-able--all drawbacks in a ""dictionary."" Just lug around the hard copy if you care about music, about words and definitions, about lexicography in general. (Unlike the real Harvard Dictionary of Music, there are no bibliographic entries, but compared to the overall dreadful implementation of the Kindle edition, this is a minor defect.)I wanted so badly to overcome the obstacles, but the Kindle incarnation of the Harvard Dictionary of Music is a disaster. Do not buy it."
3,Ok,"Just an ok movie. It's kind of interesting, but certainly not a great movie. The acting is good. It exposes an important corrupt element of US financial markets which goes on as we speak and SEC was asleep on the wheel for 8 Bush years (not a single case of naked shorting was prosecuted)."
5,Wall Street,Wall Street & Scar Face. Two movies evryone has seen. I like them both. I hear another Wall Street is coming out. Gonna see it. And compare.
5,The Original,"Great movie. I purchased it because I wanted to see the new one, but I wanted some history. Awesome DVD."
4,Swimming with Sharks,"A good look into the Jungle of Big Business, the Corruption of Power, Personal Growth, and morality."
2,BLU RAY edition review... (Not the movie!),"First of all, this is one of my favorite movies, the role Michael Douglas was born to play... Gekko!. That said, let me express my opinion on the Blu ray edition. It is very poor, you might as well buy the DVD because they look exactly the same. Do not expect HD from this edition, maybe in later ones, as they usually do, they'll do the job right. Still, if you are such a fanatic of the movie that you MUST have the Blu ray edition, go ahead, but don't expect justice to it. I gave it 2 stars instead of just one, because of the little extras (O. Stone commentaries on the making), that's all."
2,Terrible blu-ray transfer,"I have to say that this is one of the absolute worst blu-ray transfers I have seen. I am not one of those that hop on the bandwagon of this transfer stinks and so does this one and so on... I usually am pretty forgiving when it comes to these types of things. I enjoy this movie, but the blu ray version is a major disappointment. I echo the chorus of those who have said to stick with the dvd version. I give it four stars for the movie and one for the blu-ray transfer. Buyer beware."
4,Caricature of the Go-Go 1980s,"It's pretty difficult to make the manipulation of stock prices interesting in a feature length movie, but Stone kind of pulls it off. Charlie Sheen was mis-cast in the title role. I liked Hal Holbrook's brief contributions as the worldly, elder stock broker. Some of his lines are gems: ""The thing about money is that it makes you do things you don't want to do."" ""You can't get a little bit pregnant, son."" ""I don't know where you get your information from son, but I don't like it."" ""Man looks in the mirror. There's nothing staring back at him except the abyss. That's when man finds his character.""Daryl Hannah's a good-looking blonde, but can't act her way out of a paper bag. Martin Sheen is convincing as the left-leaning union leader and father. Sean Young is over-the-top awful as Gordon Gekko's spoiled, phony wife.Not a bad movie and worth seeing."
4,Timeless,"I had never seen this movie, but the advertisement for the sequel had me interested in it. I purchased & am very pleased. Gecko puts Bud at one of lifes crossroads. Should he choose money & perks for the small price of his soul? I enjoyed watching it & I think that if the sequel is 1/2 as good as this I will buy it also!!!"
3,"Blu-ray review, video transfer review","One of the worst blu-ray video transfers I've seen. Love the movie, but save yourself some money and watch the original DVD upscaled. The Blu-ray transfer has an odd graininess that while present in the source, is too pronounced in the Blu-ray transfer. Poor example of a Blu-ray transfer."
4,Duty and Honour in the Reagan era,"A young stockbroker, played by Charlie Sheen, is divided between his loyalty to his father (portrayed by his off-screen father Martin Sheen) and the desire to rise in the stock market by participating in various illegal, and inevitably dangerous, activities. Oliver Stone directs with almost a journalist's eye for the losses, the defeats, the shady goings-on, the scandals and the honours that transpired in the ""me"" decade of economic collapse amidst mounting corporate ambitions and dreams of avarice. The moral and psychological dimension, especially in Sheen's character's Faustian aspirations in conflict with his conscience, is superbly wrought as well, and the performance of Michael Douglas (who won a Best Actor Oscar, 1987) as the megalomaniacal stock-market shark, Gordon Gekko, Sheen's mentor, was undoubtably the pinnacle of his career."
4,"""I taught you the value of information... how to get it!""",Wall Street ROCKS!! watch it daily!!Fly me to the moon..
3,Just okay,I bought the set of the original Wall Street and the sequal. It was an okay movie is all I can say for it. Michael Douglas of course plays a great bad guy. I felt it was fairly predictable.
2,Too much porn - Yuck !,"As is typical from hollywood expect full frontal nudity...yuck !I purchased the film to hopefully watch an action flick not a porn flick.As for the plot. The plots ok but Hal Holbrook is this old guy who keeps comingup with ho-hum platitdes referring to his moralistic ideas of approaches to stock marketinvestment which make one want to throw up.The most interesting true story ever related to stocks is the life story of Jesse Livermore.Livermore was a poor farm boy who left home at 15 with 5.00 his mother gave him.20 years later, after learning to trade, he eventually made 100 million shorting the 1929 crash.Now theres movie potential."
1,"My favorite movie of all time, but...","Wall Street is my favorite movie of all time, but after buying the VHS tape and then the original DVD release, I'll be damned if I'm gonna buy this movie again! I guess if you don't own it already, then you may as well buy this version. For the rest of us, it's just the exact same movie repackaged again."
4,Reaganomics At The Beginning,"Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" chronicles the rise of unbridled greed, of reckless gambling with the other people's money, of soulless financiers whose God is cash. Some of the details are dated now -- the opening shots of the World Trade Towers, the IBM dumb terminals everywhere, Motorola ""brick"" wireless phones, the dollar amounts thrown about as astronomical in 1985 -- but the story behind the details and the motivations of the characters are as good a lesson as you're going to find. As a matter of fact, in the extras it is revealed that the director and cast used Bear Stearns as the model for their portrayals. How ironic then that the tagline for the film, ""Greed is good,"" should end up eulogizing the era of narcissistic excess that the movie portrays."
5,Magnificant,"This film is so good that I play it to my board once a quarter to keep them on the ball.Forget all those so called management gurus, just buy this film.p.s. I agree it's way overdue on DVD."
5,Great Acting By Michael Douglas,"I'd give the movie 3 and a half stars as a whole, but Michael Douglas' intense performance as Gordon Gekko makes it a winner. Martin Sheen was also convincing as the blue-collar dad, but his son Charlie and Daryl Hannah failed to impress me. The story is intriguing and certainly educational with regard to life in the Stock market, but Douglas' Oscar-winning performance is by far the best thing about this movie."
5,Greed is good,"This is a great character study. This is a great movie. After reading the ""bad"" reviews, I can only agree with one; Daryl Hannah's acting is pretty poor. Olive Stone has always been criticized for his inability to handle a woman on the screen, and thi is further testament to that. But to say Michael Douglas was terrible? Come on, they dont give out Oscars for bad performances. And so what if this character seemed to be the basis for every character he would play. This was the first. And most great actors play a lot of similar roles. Dustin Hoffman - was there really a difference in rainman and the graduate? And Oliver Stone as the Ed Wood of the 90's? Come on. Carol Reed of the 90's maybe. Good thing that guy saw Tim Burrton's movie.But dont take my word for it either. Watch it yourself, igt certainly deserves a gander."
1,Horrible Transfer,"This is the worst quality blu-ray I have ever seen. It's atrocious. I can't believe anyone would release a crappy exploitation movie from this poor of a print, never mind a famous Hollywood flick. Dust, scratches, and blemishes are visible throughout. Don't even bother."
3,wide-screen? my [rear]!,"I absolutely loved Wall Street! When I first saw it in the theater as a teenger, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. However, I went on to be a finance major in college & I finally understood the genius of the script. I have the movie on tape (recorded it from HBO) & I was highly anticipating the DVD especially since it was going to be in wide-screen. However, to my horror the wide-screen view is cropped from the full-screen version!!! At first I thought was mistaken. Then I set up 2 tv's - one hooked up to my vcr, the other to my dvd - & confirmed my suspicions. Perhaps I got a defective dvd, but you can try this test on your own by renting both formats. Extremely disappointed by the transfer!"
2,comparison of stock market 20 years on,"I was reminded of the movie Wall Street mentioned referred to when reading Liars' Poker a book about bond trading scams. I was amazed to see that another market crash, this time Prime Mortgage could re-occur there seems to be someone always ready to seize the opportunity to make a quick buck and not give a damn about the consequences. Just like Michael Douglas's character says ""I just move the money around"". Very compelling viewing and a warning to where you put your stocks and investments. Here in Australia the lending and valuation legislation is much tighter and harder to get a loan, although there are people now lending money to those who cannot afford it, Difference is the properties are not overvalued and the lending bodies just re-possess the property."
2,WELL,MOVIE WAS ...WELL ILL GRADE IT A C IN MY BOOK...IM NOT INTO STUFF LIKE THAT AND ALL WAS SO CROOKED
3,Oliver Stone is Wrong,"I did like this movie. However, it is full of gross exaggerations and biases that we have come to expect from Stone. First of all, the little subtitle at the beginning says that the year is 1985. No more than 20 minutes into the film Bud Fox's partner, when speaking about Gekko, says that Gekko sold Nasa stock short after the Challenger blew up. The Challenger didn't explode until 1986. Plus, I didn't know that Nasa was listed on the NYSE!!What works is Gekko's little 'Greed' speech. It's true. All humans are motivated by their self-interest. Why greed has such a bad connotation is puzzling. Gekko's other little diatribe toward the end of the film is pure [trash]. Life is not a zero-sum game. Just because you make more money, for example, doesn't mean that I will make less. If this is Stone's belief, which I'm sure it is, he's as dumb as a box of rocks.One more thing, Bud and Gordon wore awesome suits! More men need to start wearing suspenders (braces) again!"
2,"Great movie, lousy video","While this is a terrific movie, I'm finding the digital video rental to be painful to watch. The image is muddy and the colors are muted."
4,"Sharp, fast-paced, entertaining","Well worth watching, with good sharp dialogue and a crackling plot. Michael Douglas is well-cast as the amoral investment banker, and the two Sheens are convincing, too. In retrospect it seems to say more about what the 1980s were like than it does about the world of finance in general. Thank God, in the 1990s lunch is no longer for wimps."
3,Review of Wall Street,"Young broker admires Wall Street wizard, Gordon Gekko and tries to become a part of his world.It all ends badly and certainly does no good to the image of Wall Street and its denizens."
5,Greatest movie on earth,"I suggest the Movie Wallstreet to everyone who is interested in secrurities-trading. I watched it about 55 times in the past 2years!If you also like the movie, especially Gordon Gekko, you have to sent me an e-mail. I hope to hear from you soon!"
5,Suspenders Rule!,"This film raised the common suspender to the level of cultural icon. It's done more for suspenderdom than Brookes Bros ever could. Suspenders are worth fighting for. Not only do they keep your trousers up and give the modern executive a spurious impression of corporate power (when he in fact works in the mail room), they also impress the hell out of women, who seemingly never tire of twanging them."
4,good movie,I enjoyed Michael Douglas in the first Wallstreet movie I'm looking forward to seeing Money Never Sleeps too.
4,"""Terrific 80's Drama!""","Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen and Daryl Hannahstar in Oliver Stone's 1987 drama. A Wall Street trader tries tobe like his tycoon idol. Michael is great in this and it's definitelyone of his best films. Charlie is also great and this anniversaryedition has nice picture and sound plus neat extras. Get thisterrific 80's drama."
1,Blu-Ray Review,"Fox has the worse Blu-Ray transfers of any studio. Only a few of their Blu-Rays are of True Blu-Ray quality. The ones that are bad I have returned and will continue to do so. Wall Steet, Predator, A Bridge Too Far, Point Break, Hannibal etc. etc. are Not Blu-Ray Quality. See for yourself and waste money."
2,"No ""All New Commentary"" by Oliver Stone!","Be prepared for a disappointment, as this DVD doesn't include the ""all new commentary from director Oliver Stone"", merely reusing the one from the previous disc. The other additional features are great, but does not outweigh the disappointment, nor the fact that the title isn't really remastered that well from it's previous transfer."
5,Tells it like it is,An all too accurate depiction of the way Wall St. works. Anyone who's watched his hard earned money disappear on some broker's lame recommendation while the rich get richer will feel right at home here. The story of an ambitious young broker (Charlie Sheen) who wants it all right now. He gets his wish but discovers that there are some lines he will not cross. Michael Douglas got the oscar but the whole cast is excellent.
3,Video Not as Bad as Expected After Reading Reviews,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.After reading some of the reviews, I expected an awful picture. Video quality varied in this movie, some of it being poor, and some being pretty good. There is a lot of grain in some scenes. On a 10 point scale, I give it a range between 4.5 and 8.0 (I have never rated a Blu-Ray less than 4.0). It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was very good, but the surround sounds were subtle (but this was okay for a non-action movie).The movie was pretty good, not great. I had to watch this before watching the new Wall Street movie."
2,Hollywood's version of business,"If you have any business experience, you will laugh at this unrealistic look at big business. Beyond this the acting ranges from bad to fair. Now Douglas did win an Oscar but it really was for his performance in Fatal Attraction not this film. Wall Street has the Oliver Stone pedigree. And since he is a Hollywood darling, it is more acceptible to award this film than a torid film like Fatal Attraction."
1,misleading and untrue,"Making money in the movie market is good and honest while making money at the financial market is a crime? That is why ""greed is good"" is a phrase that can only be said by someone who does not have any ability to deal in the financial markets and so has to practice fraudulent insider information? That is not capitalism, that is crime. But I guess that in Mr. Stone's eyes it's the same. If you are a socialist you'll love this movie. If as in my case you are a libertarian, and you are looking for a true vision of HONEST stock market entrepreneurs you will not find it here. ""Other People's Money"" is a much better, and truthful insight."
5,one of the greatest punk albums ever,"this is my favorite band from the early so. cali. scene. it is a must for any record collection along with social distortion's ""mommy's little monster"" and black flag's ""wasted""."
4,good stuff,"How I had not heard of these guys, I can't figure out. Now I find myself pulling this one out to listen to alot cuz some of the tracks get so stuck in my mellon, I gotta hear em right away or go insane."
3,It's okay,"I got this CD right after I got into the Circle Jerks' Wild In the Streets, and I was hoping this would be as good. It's not. It's not a bad album by any means, but it's not the best punk has to offer. Get it after you get some circle jerks and black flag"
1,The Worst of the Worst,"I cannot believe how bad this movie is. My whole family could not take it. We made it through 60% of the movie before we could not take it any more. It is freaky how bad the acting is, not to mention the writing. Oh, and the sound sucks too. This is a must to see, ONLY because it is SO HORRIBLE. Warning, however, kids under 7 may find some scenes scarey - really. Good luck and may the force be with you."
5,Informative,"This was my first download and it was ""free"". The download performed well. ""The Mystery of Edgar Allan Poe"" was informative. It ran up to 50 minutes. This was a Unbox Video Download. It started with the typical intro and ended with the credits. Some individuals did not get a complete download so i included my experience with the Unbox download. i hope the review was helpful. ty."
1,Rising Sun,"The film ""Rising Sun"" is as bad as the novel by Michael Crichton is good. The film fails to capture Crichton's opinions on the Japanese, and it changes the murderer to a person who could never have been considered in the book. The makers of this film didn't care about making a good film; they just wanted to be politically correct by not insulting the Japanese. This is the only film that I've seen that I honestly wanted my money back. It is an insult to a great novelist and a fine book."
5,Rising Sun,"a very good murder mystery with a twist, Sean Connery is subperb, and combined with Wesley Snipes, make a good detective/advisor team, if this is your forte' is most deffinatley worth watching"
4,... like new and excellent condition.,A oldie but goodie and looks great in bluray format. I have it on DVD but starting to replace them all.
5,RISING SUN WAS SUPERB!,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rising Sun"" years ago and I finally found it on Amazon to add to my collection of ""WESLEY SNIPES"" Movies. I Love this movie with Wesley Snipes and Sean Connery being detectives and solving the crime. I rate this movie 5 plus stars and A big Thumbs up. It is a ""Superb"" movie!Love.Almarine The Redeemed"
3,could have been better,"The casing had about 3 or 4 scratches and plastic parts bent. When you tried to close it, you have to push the side of it to make sure it clasps together evenly, otherwise its off center and will not click together correctly. The movie itself was fine but I feel the casing made it below average as far as quality. Its not horrible but not something that would be considered ""very good"" condition which is what it was advertised for. I would not even have said good. Acceptable would have been more accurate."
2,Bleh.....,"First, I wanted to see this movie because of I heard Sean Connery played a mentor on Japanese customs to Wesley Snipes in a homicide investigation-and I thought ""How interesting!"", but after watching it, I felt the plot was disjointed, and choppy, and the dialogue was constipated.The movie does not flow well at all. I have not read the book, but I have heard it is better than the movie (as usual), and I do like Chricton's work. Still, I found this movie slow, and wondering what the point was."
2,surprised,I have to say that I was a bit surprised at the content of this movie. It should be sold as a porn product!
3,"Nothing special here, The book was WAY better","I ended up buying this DVD soon after I read the book by Michael Crichton. It isnt a bad movie, in fact, it follows the book pretty closely, with a few different things here and there. But I just didint think that the movie was filmed that well. Plus I didnt like the fact that Snipes plays the main character, who is very different acting in the book.The DVD version is nothing special. Yes, DVD's are easier to watch, but I would expect better features adn whatnot. There are non here. All and all, this is a movie to rent, not buy."
2,"Dark, foggy and complete waste of energy","Don't even consider watching this movie, if you already read the book and are hoping for a decent adaption to screen. This movie is more interested in showing us body parts than a good plot that moves and flows well.Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes do nothing to brighten the outlook or dialogue of this movie, and Steve Buscemie's role is way to short to be any help in saving the torn threads of this really awful movie. Besides being, this movie doesn't inform us why the murdered girl is playing such a big important role in the film, only that men seem to enjoy her, and who was the killer. The negotiations are never really explained also, we only know they are importent to the Japanese, and the American's are a bit wary in agreeing.If you're looking for a good Micheal Crichton movie, try Jurassic Park 1-3 or the thirteent Warrior. For all thats good and wonderful, don't, I beg you, bother with this boring, drawnout attempt at the real thing."
4,Just putting it out there,"I've never had cable, nor is it the 90's anymore, so this movie is my only means of getting that cheap late night Cinemax movie ambiance."
3,Great movie lacking any extras,"Rising Sun is a movie based on a Michael Chrichton novel just in case anyone was concerned. I like the movie and the picture and sound are great, but there aren't any extra features other than a movie trailer and a few promotional movie trailers. I was expecting at least audio commentary or a making of the film, but there is only the feature film here really."
1,"Boring, in relation to the novel.","Michael Crichton's novel ""Rising Sun"" is my favorite novel of his. I prefer it to Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, or any of his others. The film is NO tribute to the novel. It's simple - the novel is GREAT - the movie is NOT. Please, please ... read the book!!!"
5,"Rising Sun--A glitzy, fast-moving Crighton story","Dark, deep, filled with action, intrigue. Excellent acting. I wanted this Crighton story for my own film library."
3,comfortable,This bed is really comfortable but it loses air really quick. I had to inflate every night that I used it. It is fairly easy to inflate but very difficult to deflate and the chances of getting it back into the bag is next to nothing.
2,Deflated on first use,"I was very disappointed that the bed lost air the first night of use as I was staying at my son's home to care for a toddler as a new baby was being born. Waking up with a backache didn't help me function at my best. Also, every night the noisy pump had to be used to re-inflate the bed, much to the annoyance of us all with a new baby at home with a light-sleeping toddler.I told my son he could throw out the bed upon my leaving as I would not use it again while visiting them."
1,Not Good at all!,"I order this queen size bed a few weeks back. To my suprise i found the bed had a dimension of 55""X75"", which is a dimension of double size bed. I contacted the company backstore.com and i got the worst customer service. They are trying to convence me that they sent the right dimension bed and they wouldn't replace it. Also have a pretty bad return police.May i should have given a second thought before buying from this company backstore.com.Hope some one finds this useful."
2,Deflated,"This bed seemed like a really good deal, but after a month of sleeping on it, one morning I woke up sunk down to the middle. The mattress wouldn't hold air and after looking for holes for about 2 hours I gave up. I love the idea of the automatic inflate remote and the deflate release button was cool, but I just wish I could've found the mysterious hole. (The bed was only up against one wall and there was nothing on the wall to pop the bed, in case you were wondering)."
3,Loses air quite quickly,"I bought this product a week ago and its been 2days since I have been using it and I cannot say I have been satisfied, the air bed does lose considerable amount of air in one night; I have no problem refilling it every night before going to sleep but I cannot refill it in the middle of night. I will see for another week and if the situation stays the same or worsens I will return it."
1,Not a queen,"Don't be fooled. This is not a queen bed. Double sheets fit it fine. Besides the complete misrepresentation as to its size, the bed is fine."
4,Best of its kind available,"I need a firm mattress and this one fits the bill. It's easy to inflate and gets pretty firm if you aren't worried about it blowing up as the tension increases. It won't so just keep inflating. It needs an adjustment maybe twice a week, but that's not bad for this type of product."
4,Excellent Product! Blows up super fast!,I purchased this for my brother that recently started renting his first apartment. He says that this is really comfortable. No leaks!!
3,Sag in the middle,"I was very pleased with the size and set-up of this airbed. I was disappointed when I found simular products locally for less money (shipping was $30). When I asked my son and his wife how it was to sleep on this bed for a week they told me that it sagged in the middle, even after refilling the airbed, causing them to sleep cramped together all night (both do not weigh very much, perhaps 250 total)."
2,Buy a different Intex Model.,"This is a great company but this particular model is a very poor design. the bottom in NOT flat. The bottom has an outer ridge all the way around that is 8 inches wide and is 3 to 4 inches in depth which makes the center portion of the bottom hollow. This makes the mattress feel like one of those old antique mattresses you see in the old movies where the people, especially two people, roll to the middle of the mattress. If they make one that has a flat bottom I would buy that model. Everything else about the mattress is very nice."
5,Great guest bed!,"So far I've had a single person use it for two weeks, and a couple for nearly a week over the holidays. Didn't lose air, easily adjustable, fills in minutes. I especially like the way the two sections are joined closer to the center, allowing for a deep edge for bedlinens. No getting short sheeted in the middle of the night like all those double-high beds with just a little ridge around the edge.Quick delivery, excellent value."
3,You get whay you pay for,"Slept on this everynight for three months. Passable; needed to add air once a week. Not as comfortable as my previous air mattress which I slept on for 8 months, which cost double. Guess you get what you pay for."
4,EMI: Please remaster this classic!,The performance is almost beyond reproach. This 1990 version of the 1956 recording should be re-remastered in 2003. Listen to what the recent EMI remasterings of Nathan Milstein's 1954 and 1956 recordings of Bach's violin sonatas and partitas sound like. They sound like they were recorded today.
2,Remastered Mono recordings can be disappointing...,"I love some of the remastered recordings from years gone by, but the sound on this one was a little disappointing."
1,Not technically up to par with the best of them,"Comon ladies and gentleman. Another set of repertoire light years ahead of Arrau's technique. Just like the Liszt etudes Arrau is a real non factor in this music. Listen to No. 4, Chopin said Presto, Arrau says Allegretto.... actually he doesn't say it - its just he can't play any faster. In order to deal with the blatant and clear technical deficiencies he has to slow down ever 10 bars or so. Its really frustrating when a clearly technically incompetent pianist somehow receives praise for creatively finding way to circumvent dealing with the technical challenges of a piece.Just a sidenote there is one other person who agree with me about Arrau's playing...... Horowitz.Unbelievable."
3,2 LPs in 1,"These are two Baxter albums for the GNP Crescendo label from the mid-1960s. This music is easy to listen to, though at times the tracks are ""tacky."" When the mood does strike, however, I do toss this in an find it relaxes me (easily digestible music often has that quality). There is nothing here that makes a strong impression upon listeners. The most one might say after listening would be, ""Yeah, I'll give this one a listen again."" A week keeper, but a keeper no less."
1,Go for Stevia instead,"I do not like Xylitol! I have tried Stevia without any issues, but decided to try Xylitol when my Stevia ran out as I'd heard good things about it. I have gluten sensitivities and this product, although it says it is gluten-free, made me feel all of my symptoms (nauseous, tummyache, diarrhea, gassy, etc.) This product is just not good for me."
2,Clumpy and chemical aftertaste,"I recently purchased Jarrow's xylitol because I was out of my usual brand and the only place I could find any xylitol was in Whole Foods. Apparently Whole Foods only stocks Jarrow. Anyhow, I recently purchased Jarrow's xylitol and, to quote Julia Roberts to the nasty saleslady in Pretty Woman, ""Big mistake. Huge.""This product has the fine, powdery consistency of baking soda and seems just as inclined towards clumping, even with the addition of a chemical anti-clumping agent. I'm not sure whether it's this fineness or this chemical additive (silicon dioxide), but when I put a little spoonful into my mouth, instead of dissolving evenly into a sweet, clear liquid, it turned into a thick glop. It also has a weird aftertaste that I've never noticed in other xylitol brands. Those of you raving about this stuff ought to sample a few other brands first."
4,Healthy and cheap,"The much touted health benefits of xylitol made me buy this product. It is a huge amount of sugar in a very fine, powdery form.I deduct one star for the misleading label which makes everyone think it is a protein powder. It should be marketed as a healthy, organic product rather than something which looks like a genetically engineered ""get-big-quick"" supplement."
2,Corny comedy,"We like Don Ameche. We truly admire Tom Selleck. But this was sad. We were very disappointed in this DVD. The comic aspects were 'overboard' - no, just plain STUPID."
1,Folks by tom sellick,this is a excellent video we never get tired of watching it andwe received it so fast great work
4,Great humorous family film,This is a film everyone can enjoy. It's unpredictable and funny. All the characters are unique and lend their own special touch to the comedy. I highly recommend for all to see.
5,Best Movie Ever,Do you believe we have found someone who has never seen this movie.Has always been one of our favorites.Glad we found itIts going to make a wonderful Stcking stuffer
1,a good movie that is now out of print.,This was a good comedy from the early 90's. However this is a ripoff for 96.00 new. as some ripoff artist is making cdr copies of the original dvd. The movie is worth watching and deserves a blu ray release even. But this is insane.
3,Why???,Sure I like the movie and want to add it to my DVD collection but WHY is it so expensive??? Can anyone tell me that for gods sakes???
4,Good movie but not worth the insane high price,"I love this movie. It's really funny. It's a great story good cast and memorable lines. But still that price. One has to be insane to pay that much. Unless one is loaded and still it's way too much. Now if the price was lowered to at least 19.00, 13.00 then I would say maybe. But as they say in poker ""it's too rich for my blood"""
4,Folks,The movie is very funny well acted and really enjoyable to watch. If you enjoy a good laugh you will enjoy this movie. This is a movie that you can sit down with the whole family and watch and not be concerned about language or content. I definitely give this movie my thubs up.
5,comedy,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!!! It has been years since I first viewed it,I still find this movie to be hilarious. Can't wait to view it again!!!"
1,the worst movie ever,"I'm sorry, but this is one of a few movies I've ever seen that I couldn't finish. It's that bad. Poor acting, poor script, poor everything. Only good for tormenting someone."
1,Why so expensive??,Why is this movie soo expensive? It is a very good movie but NO movie is worth $96.00!Is this a misprint?
5,I love this movie!,"This is an older movie but it is still very funny! Unlike a lot of movies that after you have seen the trailer you have seen all the action that the movie contains, this movie keeps moving through the entire story! It is funny, touching and probably hits home with a lot of families! So glad it is finally on DVD! If you have never seen this and love to laugh and cry all in the same movie, this is a must see. It is also an excellent bargain!"
5,Great Movie,"Fantastic, hilarious movie. Great casting and wonderful heart touching performances. Scary insight to what might happen with my own parents in the future. I would give it an 8 out of 10."
5,Raise the roof,"Two Thumbs up! This is one of my favorite movies. If you enjoy a good laugh, then pick this one up. It's comedy style is similar to In&Out and Office Space."
4,Very satisfied customer.,Thank You. The item was properly packaged and in great condition. I am a very satisfied customer.
5,The Art of Russian Cuisine,"This particular collection of recipes is by far the best found. The author has included some of most traditional and best loved dishes like Russian Pound Cake to Bliny. This book is a must for anyone interested in Russian cooking or would like to try something out of the ordinary. For those folks that are experienced cooks and chefs, this book is great to enhance any menu or party. I highly recommend this book for anybody how loves food with a festive flare!"
2,"Not All That Glitters&#65533;,","The kind of place anyone would love to reside is the Eastlake Island, such a civilized atmosphere with a few inhabitants living under secured conditions. Its like living in a real golden fishbowl. the Eastlake inhabitants knows about themselves and have the knowledge of their various means of income but until naughty things began to unveil when in an attempt to catch petty shoplifters, scanners where attending to customers in self service stores and the irony began to unfold to a drama of blackmail thieves living among the civilized. The surprise emerged as a perfect opportunity for the latter and which they utilized but like chase, no one goes unnoticed."
5,Excellent and suspenseful,"I have been a Chase addict ever since I read his first book ""Cade"" in early 70's. I don't understand why Americans don't read his books. I own several of his books and I welcome enquiries from others who wish to borrow on a reciprocal basis."
4,Consider Yourself Dead??,"I have read most of Chase's novels and am equally frustrated to learn that his novels are no longer in print. I wonder why? I sure can find many of his books in your listings except one titled -""Consider Yourself Dead"". I hope am not confusing this book with ""You have yourself a Deal"".With all the spy novels set in a world war scenario,this one slides to ""typical spy story"" type; the plot hovering around just a few characters.As far as I can recall my memory,an intense rivalry between two factions brings about espionage into the picture.Finally,the plot condenses,yet reinforces,to two characters -the Hero and the Villain.It's a typical Gun fight story that I've ever read. If you want to travel back to your childhod and play with guns,then hunt for this book!"
5,"Incredibly good plot, which is thrilling all the way!","James Hadley Chase is the king of crime fiction! Believe me. He is my hero when it comes to story-telling. His stories are full of suspenses and thrill. He tells stories that are beyong your wildest imagination. Boy! what an author. I can't understand why his books are no longer printed. are all the publishers blind? James Hadley Chase is number one. You might say what about Christe Agathy and Sidney Sheldon. Well, they cannot even come close to him. Every page in his books is thrilling and fun. man! I wish you read them. Does anyone want to exchange his books with me. I have a collection of him."
5,"Fast paced, suspenseful, captivating thriller.","Anyone who has not read his books has a literary void in their life. I have worn out many a seat edge reading his books. His command of the language, his ability to put you smack in the middle of the action, his humour everything, is outstanding!The President of the US should declare an Executive Order to command his books be put back in print.I own several books, and in my opinion, he's the leader of the pack and not the mongrel sitting on the porch.James Hadley Chase is ""The Man!!"""
5,True music,One of the best musical arrangements I have had the pleasure of listening to. A true genius and a great addition to my library
3,excellent although not for everbody,"This album is awesome and deserves the five stars that all above have given it. I my humble opinion this is the best album that Suicidal has ever produce with Join The Army running a close second. I only give this album a three star as it is not the type of album that just anybody will enjoy. Many people don't like to hear musik that packs a punch the way this album does. If you do, read five stars in this review, if you don't pick it up anyway you may change your mind. The rage released by Mike Muir,is simply awesome in its power and the images that it evokes. I first heard this album in '92 and fell in love with it. In closing why don't they make them like this anymore?"
4,"Just wanted Pepsi, but she wouldn't give it to me!","I am mostly a hip hop/rap listener, but the song institutionalized is one of the best songs in all genre. This song made me into a punk rock/metal listener. Suicidal Tendancies is the best punk rock band out there, period."
4,Every ST album since this one has been a suicidal failure.,"This is the only Suicidal Tendencies album worth owning, but MAN is it good. This is one of the first punk albums I bought back in the eighties and today it still stands up completely. It may not be as relevant or politcal as Dead Kennedys, but it's still loaded with a bunch of classics including, ""Institutionalized"", ""I Saw Your Mommy"", ""Suicidal Failure"", ""Subliminal"". Mike Muir's everyteen vocals are perfect and the tight guitar work is phenominal. Get this album."
5,True Spirit!!,"This is true ST!! This is one of the true old school punk albums of all time along with ""Fresh Fruit"" (DK) and Damaged (BF). Be true to your roots, be empassioned, be INSTITUTIONALIZED!!! Proof you can wear a tie and be hardcore at heart!!!!"
4,how do you know what MY best interest is?,"ST were the great hybrid band. Part skate part punk part metal part thrash. I don't think that anyone has ever put it all together like this. There have been many imitators. But nothing comes close to the edge of this album. When this Institutionalized first came out, the video and the sound was shocking, kind of like the LA version of the Sex Pistols first coming out on the scene. The difference here is the musicianship, the guitar playing is virtuousic and the rest of the band is smoking as well. Muir's lyrics are also compelling enough that you have to listen to them as well."
4,Celtic Folk Metal and Shaney Mac too!,"This is a good hybrid of rock metal and Celtic folk music, using instruments from both genres. The main folk influence is from the flute and bouzouki. As a bonus, Shane MacGowan sings on two tracks from the traditional Irish canon (Spancil Hill & Ride On). At first listen some songs had more of a progressive metal sound than I would prefer, but I like it more with each listen. The female singer has quite a pleasant voice, there is just enough harsh growling type singing and the mix of rock and folk instruments goes together like ham & swiss. Considering metal's longtime concern with medieval & fantasy themes and imagery, it is natural to integrate it with historical instruments and sounds."
1,Yuck!,This was a huge disappointment. This is nothing like I thought it would be. It sounds like a really bad cross breed between the stage show Celtic Women and B-side Cranberries songs. Not good. Check out Waylander instead for Irish folk music/metal blend.
5,4 year old star wars freak,My son has this game he recieved it for Christmas he is so totally into Star Wars He is four years old and loves this Game.My husband and I also gave this game to our 9 year old nephew for Christmas because he asked for it and he loves it. and we purchased it again for a birthday gift for an eleven your old just last month.so there is something for all of the kids
4,Good Family Fun,"An excellent shooter-game that's kid-friendly. Challenging at times, without getting frustrating. My only knock would be on (1) the camera angles and (2) the weak instructions booklet (which, like most instruction booklets nowadays, doesn't do a great job explaining every facet of the game)."
5,Excellent !,"My son loves this game and like to explore more chalenging levels. If he have got fun - I am happy too, even don't have a clue what this game supposed to do.Magdalena Smith"
5,Great game,"This game is awesome, if you love star wars the movie then you will defintely love this game which shows all the characters as lego's."
4,Nice overview of current issues in special education,"As a special education administrator and a doctoral student in special education I appreciate the opportunity to look at issues from different perspectives. I am familiar with many of the authors included in the book and thought that the editor did a very good job in choosing people to contribute. All-in-all, a nice, concise overview of current issues that all special educators should be aware of."
3,An oddball Bruckner Sixth from Davis,"In the U.K., hwere to show even modified rapture for the work of Colin Davis is the equivalent in shame as betraying the Official Secrets Act, this live Bruckner Sixth with the LSO got good reviews. But even the most sanguine critics had to admit that Sir Colin's take was odd. He tones down the great brass epiphanies, keeps the temperature low throughout, and favors tempos relzed to the point of lethargy in the Scherzo. Ther are many problems in the enigmatic Sixth that even the most seasoned Brucknerians find hard to crack. Davis simply ignores them, moving form point A to B as if ntohing is amiss. To my earws there is a lot amiss. Unless you ae a die-hard fan of the LSO or Davis, this one's a miss."
1,Arts and Crafts Project,"Purchase this CD and give it a listen. Purchase five or six more copies, and with a couple wire coat hangers and some fishing line, you can fashion yourself a dandy spinning mobile. Shiny enough to entertain toddlers, or to frighten unwanted pests from your garden, this mobile may be finest 'green' alternative to relistening to the CD without just tossing it in the trash.Unfortunately, this recording is not particularly insightful or inspiring, not a suitable first choice for a new listener to Bruckner, and definitely not a replacement for a favorite recording by a seasoned listener.Many times when attending a fine concert, I think, ""That was really quite a performance, I hope it will be rebroadcast on radio, or released on CD."" I wonder if the attendees of this concert were thinking something similar. Mmmmmmmmm.........probably not."
1,vhs used people,i already have done this but here i go againthe item i purchased said it was in excellent condition and therefore i paid more thanother selectionsthe item was received but the audio was horrible i have purchased many items from Amazon and havebeen very satisfied this was the first one that i was not - very disappointed with Amazon not taking ownershipand fixing the problem still to this date have not heard from the subsender regarding the problemwhat do i do now
5,wonderful,A must see film totally underated We loved the mix of religions and how really raw the characters were A tale with a great twist of love and a wonderful restrained love from Mother-Daughters relaitionship What did Shirley Maclaine have on her dinner plate when her daughter told her the news she was moving to California what a scene Kathy Bates was marvellous Go buy it Now
5,The best Pecheurs de Perles ever done,"This recording of Pecheurs is peerless. I had it on vinyl and so longed to hear it again I was almost forced to buy a turntable. Phooey! After wasting my money on all the other versions out there here at last Preiser Records has remastered the best ever. It is exquisite in every way. The singing by Mattiwilda Dobbs, Enzo Seri, Jean Borthayre and Lucien Mans is so so gorgeous. It is in the French style where notes are attacked on the mark and not slid in and out of as in the italien style. The voices are pure and spinto as needed for this opera and the passion is there fully. This delicate and gentle piece is sung and conducted so well. In addition although this is an old recording it sounds brand new! The depth of the orchestra and the voices are spread out completely from left to right and the depth of the auditorium comes through. It sounds live. Congratulations to Preiser Records for a great job. Highly recommended."
5,One of Leibowitz's finest opera recordings,This is indeed a most sensational account of this opera. The only negative is that some of the highs are bit distorted on the recording. Such huge tragedy Leibowitz was so rarely recorded.
3,Bands are cheap,"The watch bands are warped and not good looking. Quality up close is D- at best. Far away, it looks like an expensive watch. The are only 4 diamond/crystal looking stones that are minuscule on the outside bezel.I recommend it as an everyday watch. Not great for a gift. The watch band is too warped."
3,"Poulence and Milhaud shine, but the rest can be samey.","Pahud perhaps errs in beginning his disc with by far its strongest piece, Poulenc's joyously melodic 'Flute Sonata', serenely playful, influenced by Stravinsky's neo-classicism, but spiritually just as close to Mozart. The only other work here that compares is Poulenc's old 'Les Six' chum Milhaud's 'Sonatina', which has a rhythmic energy and strangeness that marks it out from its rather fey surroundings.Three of the works are Conservatoire test pieces, and they show, Dutilleux's and Sancan's being pleasant, but samey variations on Debussy and Faure. Ibert's contributions are more original, but just as amiably forgettable. Messian's replication of bird-song, 'Le Merle Noir', is evocative and exciting, but fatiguing; Jolivet's closer just fatigues. Pahud's playing is flexible and expressive throughout, and Le Sage's quiet invention on the piano shouldn't be ignored, but this disc really only sparkles on first hearing."
5,What Your Mom Never Taught You: Excellent House Cleaning Resource,"Helpful household cleaning technique book that is easy-to-read and is a quick read for busy people. This book is an awesome starting point with clear, concise, practical tips. I especially liked her ideas on how to make household purchases that are easy to clean and maintain."
5,A good read for anyone interested in the environment,"Trash Talk is a must read for anyone who is interested in helping the environment. It is an easy to read and understand manual, with practical tips for waste managment that anyone can use. It contains tips ranging from, how to use left over grocery bags, to, what to do with old toothbrushes, and at the end of each chapter is a nice summary of the main points. Every reader is guaranteed to find many practical ideas they can institute in their own lives"
4,Good for the Environment,"A great book on suggestions on how to reuse everyday household items instead of throwing them into the trash. If you want to do your part and help our environment, Trash Talk gives some excellent advice."
1,Where is this movie on DVD? B grade movie,This b grade science fiction stars Adam Baldwin . It's a very strange movie. There is a lot of nudity from Adam Baldwin showing off his rear and hairy chest. The movie also co-stars Robert Englund from the Nighmare on Elm Street series as one of the aliens in this campy movie.Also where is this movie on DVD? Whoever owns it should put it out on DVD ASAP!! I'd love to replace my videotape of this movie if possible!
2,Science Fiction Sex,"Star Quest II didn't have much of a good dialogue or plot, in fact, it was mostly erotica in space. If you want to see erotica, stripping, and sex scenes, this is the movie for you. If you want plot, and dialogue, see another movie. This movie was a waste of time."
5,perfect fit,"This item was a perfect fit for my '96 Windstar. I went to Auto Zone and Pep Boys to find a replacement mirror glass when my passenger side mirror broke, and both stores wanted over $30. This item is more in the price range I was expecting."
3,"looks ok to me, but I don't drive","I thought the mirror was just fine, but I don't drive,my son says that it appears to be a carnival mirror. As far as the dilivery of the mirror it arrived on time. I was satisfied but he wasn't."
4,A tale of sorrow and elation,"This is a delightful book about a poor family of an old man, an old woman and a young boy named Johnny who merrily whistles his way through life. However, the family comes on hard times when their animals are lost and the decision is made that Johnny must leave. He packs up his few possessions and the old woman bakes him a journey cake for him to eat. As he walks along, the cake pops out of his sack and rolls away, taunting him. He gives chase and when he passes various animals, they join in the pursuit of the journey cake. The cake rolls and rolls, until it eventually falls over. Johnny looks around and discovers that he is back where he started and he has brought an entire entourage of farm animals with him.The book is well illustrated and has a happy ending when Johnny returns home. However, some children may be disturbed by the thought of the child having to leave home when bad times fall on the family."
1,be warned,"The pen went together fine with a little assistance and looks nice. HOWEVER, 3 weeks after receiving it, I received a call on my cell phone asking about my experience and asking me to give it a good review. This was very disturbing because I really don’t like being bothered like this since I am a frequent amazon buyer, plus there is no way they could have my cell number unless amazon gave it to them. Then today, I got an email also asking for a review. So here’s the review and a warning to anyone else who buys this item."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,Purchased for yorkie puppy and could not be more pleased. This is a very good looking crate and with the wheels it easily rolls from room to room. Also easy to transport when traveling by auto. Serves as playpen for puppy when left alone. Caution: pay attention to size - remember my yorkie weights less than 3 pounds.
5,beautiful crate!,"I just got it today, was easy to build by my self. It holds up nicely, and it looks so much better in person that in the default picture posted (i've posted some of my cavalier king charles in the crate). My dog is prob about 10 lbs or so, and its a perfect size for him. The wood looks so nice with the contrast of the black bars, really a nice piece. I love that it has wheels so i can move the crate around the apartment."
2,One Man's Justice,"A good looking film, but not enough action. Brian Bosworth is good, and he deserves to be a bigger star. If you want to see his best film (5 stars), watch 'Stone Cold'. That film may well be considered his Citizen Kane."
5,Love this print!,"I was doing some decorating, and have always loved this print so I thought this was a perfect and inexpensive addition to the room. It arrived on time, carefully packaged, UNdamaged which was GREAT, it was affordable, color quality is good, I really can't complain. Finally framed it, and hung it yesterday (June 2012) and it looks great! I would buy from this seller again."
5,suprime pic,"Le Chat Noir (French for ""The Black Cat"") was a 19th-century cabaret, meaning entertainment house, in the bohemian Montmartre district of Paris.a truly piece of art.great product."
4,very nice sound,I bought this for my 8 year old son to start learning native drumming. It was simple but has a great sound. Loved it.
5,A Great Punk Album,"One of the better old school punk bands , although they can never compare to the Circle Jerks , or the Dead Kennedys , they are still one of my favorites. "" Cold Blue "" is my alltime favorite song"
2,"Sharp, but weak.","Never had a plastic knife before so said what the heck and bought it. Not exactly something I would expect to use in a SD scenario, perhaps as a last resort. One good stab is all you can expect, if your lucky two. Then say goodbye to the tip of it, cuz it will break off!"
1,plastic,"This product is made of plastic. It is more like a child's toy than a ""cold steel push blade."""
5,You've got the pipes - My Girl,"When an artist can sing so many types of music and keep you interesed they are an American Idol. Being an American mean part of an melting pot and Fantasia is showing with her vocal range she has the ability to mix that pot. Can this girl blow or what, I could not wait for her CD to drop and early this morning I purchased it from a 24hr store and LOVE IT. All I could say riding into the office now that's my girl, you go. It is refreshing to see a young person today in touch with the classic music. You can't know where you're going if you don't know what was before you. I expect to see so much from this young lady who's got the pipes to do anything she sets her mind too. You are an example for your baby girl. GO Girl."
2,"Fantasia is Good, this Single is not...","Just to clarify what the reviewer below me said, it does sound like Fantasia is screaming some of the time but that is largely because the CD is horribly over produced. Note to Producers: There is NOT a picture of the background track on the cover, I DID NOT buy this to hear your background track.On every American Idol CD I have heard it has been a little jarring to hear someone I was used to hearing live sing in a studio (two vastly different recording environments) but this just went over board and was, by far, the worst Idol CD to date."
3,Great for a first timer!,"This young lady has a beautiful voice. Do not let some of the reviewers comments discourage you from checking this artist out(it's very obvious what the reviews are based on, but no matter how hard they try they can't replace true talent). I only gave her three stars because I feel a seasoned vet might have done better."
4,Don't make it personal!,"(...) As for the CD, I give it 4 stars. I think that her performance in ""I Believe"" was the single best performance of any American Idol contestant. I have it saved on my Tivo and I still watch it about once a week. It really moved me. I think her performance on American Idol was better than the version on the CD. Quinton Tarrintino said it best when he told Fantasia that he wanted to hear her rock the house. She did that best on Amercian Idol and not quite as well on the CD - although I am sure that is due to the producers of the album. On her first full length cd, I'd like to really hear her rock the house!"
3,"Exellent talent, average music.","It is obvious that Fantasia has a wonderful music talent, she's one of the only singers I've ever heard that can make those god awful note trills inspired by Mariah Carey sound musical and appropriate. Her performance in ""Summertime"" is amazing, showing that with the right material, she really could become one of the greats. But that is, with the right material. The only original song here, ""I Believe"", is hopelessly lame and ordinary, and sounds surprisingly familiar, though I can't think of what song it sounds like. She's got the pipes, but she really needs to find the material to suit her great voice."
5,Amazing first single,This is by far the best single from any Idol finalist. I believe that she truly nails every note of this amazing single. Every song is lifted with her amazing vocals and I would recommend this single 100 percent to any fan of good music.
2,I don't think so,"summertime is not all its cracked up to be take the visual away and its not so great. her upper register is almost child like sounding very nasal. fantasia is a great performer but not a great singer. theres one macy grey and believe me thats far too many. I belive is a mess this girl is supposed to be the best singer in the country, well then were in trouble. kelly clarkson is the only AI to show true promise five years down the road she will probably still be around. I wouldnt buy this single. lets wait till fantasia album comes out then well really see what see can do"
2,IT WAS OK!!!,"NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS SINGLE.THE ONLY SONG I LIKE IS ""CHAIN OF FOOLS"" & WE HEARED IT BEFORE ON AI3 CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I WAS EXPECTING BETTER QUALITY THATS ALL.FANTAISA IS TALENTED BUT THAT WASNT FEATURED IN THE SINGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!PERSONALY I DNT RECOMMEND IT."
2,I Believe / Chain of Fools / Summertime,I like her songs but there is to much yelling in the songs.She has a great voice but for me it would be better to tonedown some notes. I love the vibes and energy.
2,Not the best...,"I thought that this CD wasn't my favorite, and that ""Summertime"" was getting really old for my taste. Barrino performed it three times on American Idol, and none of the times did it impress me to a certain point that it seemed to for the judges. Her voice seemed a little nasally and seemed to be distracted a lot by all of her ""yeah yeah's"". I was not all that impressed by this single."
1,Disappointed in CD Single!,"I like fantasia on the show but was disappointed with her cd, she sounds to nasal and screechy, I believe is a gospel song which I really don't hear the soul in her voice but maybe its because I just don't like the song. The other two well just aren't good in my opinion. Their are so many better singers out there."
1,One star for the accompaniment,"Zero star for the vocals. This girl simply doesn't deserve airtime. Her voice is squeaky, her tone is pitchy, and her style is ugly. No wonder she's already a has-been after releasing only one single!"
2,Good but would that be enough!,"I think Fantasia is a very talented singer with a bright future. I love her energetic powerful voice makes me believe that nothing is impossible but her styles of music will only be for a certain type of market. When you are in the music industry, you need a broader market (music for everyone) in order to be a star and I don't think that she will be there..Her song is on the billboard at #1 but compare with previous AI winners(Kelly & Ruben) her sales is not even half of them on their first week..and that doesn't look promising for her future. Anyway! I wish you all the best of luck Fantasia..I may not like the type of your music or the way you sing it but I have nothing against you and I think that you work hard to be where you are and you deserve to go along the way!"
1,Hurts my ears,I can't believe she was able to win a talent contest with this voice! Her voice is so screechy that it actually hurts my ears. Don't waste your money on this.
1,Horrible CD!,"This album offers nothing more than the bad performances that Fantasia showed on American Idol. Her voice is as annoying as ever - very squeaky as if she's not singing. The style is no better. The constant hange in lyrics to yeah, yeah, yeahs is absolutely shows absolutely no class and no espect for the composers of the songs.This is the worst AI CD I've ever purchased. While I don't agree with the personal attacks made on her on this site, I'm not surprised that the one-star reviews are overwhelming.Those who don't like her CD have as much right to say their piece as those who like it. If Fantasia's fans can't take the criticisms being made on their idol, they shouldn't put her in such a high-profile position."
1,Awful!!,"Don't waste your money on this CD, unless you enjoy screaming instead of singing! Spend the money on Diana's single, someone who can actually sing!"
5,ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS,"I have never been a fan of anyone's before until now. Fantasia is absolutely marvelous. ""I believe"" couldn't be better. She's made ""Summertime"" her own. And her ""Chain of Fools"" is a classic within itself. Aretha would be proud. I wish you much success and God's favor which I think you already have."
5,A SUPER STAR,"She's one in a million. I love her new single, she talented and beautiful. May God continue to bless you. This was a wonderful gift I received. I recommend everyone to go out and get this cd."
1,Screechy Idol,I can't believe anyone is buying this piece of nothing! Shouldn't have won! Just goes to show that the voting is screwed up! Need to change it to reflect real talent.
1,"Not on my watch, NO!","I can not allow myself to purchase the soundtrack for the TV show Girls Behaving Badly (joke). Seriously, I heard enough of her on the American Idol to last me three lifetimes. Actually, originally I wrote this review without listening to the free sample clips. I just finished listening to them and popped three Advil. She is a average singer who sells albums based on her charisma. The songs are painful to listen to and the production is also very hallow/empty sounding (B-rated)."
1,1 star review for 1 star performer.,If you are a single mom I highly recommend this cd because it will make you happy. otherwise - just like a duck on helium.
1,Sorry - Overdone,"She might have power in her voice but it is one that is best suited for Broadway. Too much of everything is not a good thing. Thought the tone on her CD might be downplayed from AI but was wrong. Overproduced, oversung ~ OVERDONE!"
1,disappointed,"I'm disappointed in this CD. I just didn't like it. ""I believe"" is a porr excuse for a song, full of every cliche we've ever heard in a song. Fantasia's voice has a squeaky quality that I just do not care for."
1,Fantasia Burrino,"I can't believe that anybody would think her voice is good. I think she needs voice lessons, and then she will be listenable.Her intonation is horrible. Any singer with experience knows that you need to have pure, round sounds instead of a closed, cartoon sound."
2,"Okay, but she's no Diana Degarmo.","I was disappointed to see that Fantasia won over Diana. I think she's WAY overrated. Her voice really isn't that good. The only thing good about this CD is I Believe, but Diana really tore it up on that one. I love AI, but Fantasia is not one of the best singers to come from the show. I'm debating whether or not to buy her CD when it's released, but chances are that I probably won't unless I can get it cheap. What's the deal with everyone saying that her rendition of Summertime is anything wonderful? When I heard it, I really didn't care for it. Chain Of Fools is okay, but it's not really my cup of tea, either. I would say this-save your money and buy Diana's CD, you probably think I'm biased, but I'm not because I have enjoyed everyone on AI thus far. I just firmly believe that Diana has the stronger voice and the upper hand over Fantasia."
1,Yuck!!,"I don't think that Fantasia should have won. When she ""sings"" it's just a bunch of screeching and scratching, not really singing at all, but that's just me. and chain of fools was just taken from the soul cd wasn't it? it sounds exactly the same. I think it would have been better for her fans if she released something that everyone hasn't already heard!!"
1,"PURE, UNADULTERATED **** !!!","HOW WOULD I AND MANY OTHERS I KNOW DESCRIBE FANTASIA'S VOICE? UMMMMMM? LET ME SEE?? BABYISH, GRATING, NAILS DOWN A BLACKBOARD, SREECHING, NASALLY, JUST TO NAME A FEW. GOD KNOWS HOW SHE GOT SO FAR, OH I KNOW !! RANDY JACKSON, THAT'S WHO & HOW, WITHOUT HIM SHE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE TOP 32 LET ALONE THE TOP 2. LATOYA WAS FAR BETTER, MAYBE JENNIFER HUDSON, AND THE WAY DIANA DIGARMO SINGS ""I BELIEVE"" IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. FANTASIA ISN'T EVEN IN D/D's LEAGUE. FANTASIA WILL HOPEFULLY ONLY BE A ONE HIT WONDER AND WE WON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO HER DRIVEL ANYMORE."
1,"Really wanted to like it, but...","Now I wish Jennifer Hudson had won. What bad luck she had. She's so much better than Fantasia, with a rich voice and versatile style. I really wanted to like Tasia's debut, but there's no variety here and song selection is poor. (Chain of Fools is not a good choice to cover, since nobody can compare to Aretha). Sure hope the full-length album by Fantasia is better (I'll make sure I preview it first before buying, though.)"
1,annoying,"I love the series and always buy the new releases, but this one is really annoying. I couldn't get through it...I think she does better live. Very disappointed."
1,"BORING, SINGS LIKE A FROG & DANCES LIKE A DUCK!","What else is there to say, I cannot believe this single. The I believe song can be found in any church and would sound better then Fantasia, She sings like a frog and struts across the stage like a duck. Saw her performance tonight at macys holiday 4th and had to change the channel when I saw her hiphuggers showing more then I wanted to see. Come on Fantasia, your no britney spears, and definately no star. Give it up before you really make yourself look bad."
4,Nice beginning,"This is a nice cd-single. Her version of ""I Believe"" is solid, if not spectacular. I believe the song is one that will sound better live. Her other two songs are also pretty solid.(editorial: it's entirely inappropriate for some fan or fans to post negative reviews that have nothing to do with the music. It's clearly an attempt to bring down the ""average"" star rating for this cd-single. It's pretty juvenile, and I hope Amazon cleans up the mess.)"
5,"What's with this ""squeak"" sour-grapes reviewer?","Whoever this person is...it is blatantly obvious there is something not-at-all right about this person. For someone to take this much time and energy to convince everyone that they don't like Fantasia...is just a tad...obsessive. We get it, okay?And if you doubt that it's the same person making each one of these 1-star reviews...look at how they use the same phrasing and terminology over and over...accusing fantasia of being a ""duck"" (huh?)...and being ""squeaky""...and using the ""yeah, yeah, yeah's"".Could it be obsessive compulsive disorder? Sour grapes? A head injury? Alcohol? Hmmm. Makes you wonder.Fantasia was and is the American Idol of 2004. She deserved to win...because she was the best. Simon knew it...Paula Knew it....Randy knew it. And America knew it.Get over it already, Mr. or Mrs. Squeaky-Duck Reviewer. Let it go. You'll feel better. And so will we."
1,This sucked!,The only song good on this cd single was I Believe. The rest of the songs sucked! Save your money for Diana's single when it comes out.
5,Looking forward to her album,I have been waiting for her single and I believe that she will do better than Clay and even Kelly. Listening to this single is like going to a church of Fantasia. She has the young Diana Ross voice and Tina Turner's personality. I am waiting for her new album and will get that the first day.
2,She is an amazing singer,"I can't say enough about Fantasia Barrino. My only problem is the music is awful and the production really stinks! Sorry Fantasia, but they let you down."
1,not good enough,"this cd isnt good at all, her voice just doesnt record well i wouldnt recommend it at all"
2,Well.......,All i have to say is...Fantasia first single is summertime and diana's single dont cry out loud is completly destroying fantasia's single in the charts...Fantasia's next single is chain of fools....Diana's is dreams...looks like 2 of 3 diana's singles r gonna beat fantasia's
1,Do not recommend this CD,"I was looking forward to this CD ever since I found out she was going to release it. I was so anxious to listen to it after I bought it, but it's just terrible. I usually like Fantasia's voice, but it's so nasal. I don't plan to buy her album whenever its released. This was just very bad for her."
1,"Like Simon Said, Donald Duck on Helium!","For once in this whole year of American Idol did Simon get it right when he told Fantasia that she sounded like Donald Duck on helium! I thought that I would get the cd and give her a chance because I love American Idol and its whole concept, and we all know that artists sound better on recordings than live, but boy was I wrong! It is the same cartoon voice that she sang with live. You would think that they could have done some fancy productions to cover some of that up on this!! It is just a terrible, terrible effort. Nothing but high pitched shrills and shrieks, sounds like a poor cat dying a slow, miserable death. Summertime is so boring it will make you cry and Chain of Fools with all the added stupid lyrics makes you want to shoot yourself, and I Believe is just like hearing the dentist drill into your teeth. Sorry, but this is not American Idol music! Come on, what happened to talent like Clay and Kelly?"
1,Very bad choice America!,"She shouts they songs, is flat and off key. She has a nasel sounding voice that is unpleasant and sounds like a cartoon....!!!! I gave my CD to a fan of Fantasia. I don't see what she sees in her."
1,Different,I can't say I liked this at all. The songs all have the same sound although different titles. I was disapointed. Maybe the next run for hew will be better.
2,Bland and boring,"This single has 3 songs. The first, I Believe, is a bland, boring collection of cliches about striving for your dreams. Probably meant to be inspirational, it falls far short, especially since the poor ennunciation makes it very hard to understand many of the words. Summertime is good, but a little over the top and too theatrical. For an awesome version of Summertime, listen instead to Renee Olstead's. Now That is how Summertime should sound. Chain of Fools is not bad but falls far short of the original. Overall, I would say save your money."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"do not buy this cd! fantasia is a horrible singer and the only reason she won season 3 of american idol is cuz the judges kept pushing for her. i personally think they were told to do that cuz the show was called ""racist."" of course, the show is not racist; just look who won season 2: ruben! fantasia's voice is annoying and can make even the best song unbearable. save your money, dont get this cd!"
1,Excruciating!!!!,What a dissapointment!! It is absolutely painful to listent her squeeky attempts at singing. Was this the best American Idol had???? YIKES!!!
2,Nothing Special,"Fantasia sings with her heart, but the tone of her voice sounds nasal. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Don't like her!,"I do not like Fantasia at all! Diana is such a better singer! Fantasia sounds like Mickey/Minnie Mouse! Her I believe is so horrible, while Diana's is so good! If you like I believe, just go listen to Diana, your ears will thank you. But I do have say that she did sing summertime very well during the show."
1,One star for Cat in Heat's effort!,"As one reviewer aptly said, ""Zero star for the vocals. This girl simply doesn't deserve airtime. Her voice is squeaky, her tone is pitchy, and her style is ugly. No wonder she's already a has-been after releasing only one single!"""
3,Reviewing the Reviews,"I read a lot of reviews on Amazon, and I have never seen reviews like these. Usually the reviews are thoughtful opinions written about the product (music, book, dvd...), not silly, mean spirited, sophmoric jabs at the artist. If you don't care for the artist, why waste your time here? Move on.These reviews seem like junior high school - attacking another kid because they're different.Like Fantasia, don't like Fantasia - your choice, but you can still be respectful."
5,AWESOME!!!! AND THEN SOME!!!!!,"FANTASIA YOU ARE BLESSED WITH A RARE GIFT OF TALENT. I BOUGHT YOUR CD AND LOVED IT. YOU MAKE MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS EVERYTIME I HEAR YOU SING I BELIEVE AND SUMMERTIME. I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK IN LIFE AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU. I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYBODY TO PURCHASE THIS CD. KEEP ON BELIEVING, I KNOW I BELIEVE NOW IN MY OWN LIFE."
3,It was good BUT........,"This is a good single. Fantasia's voice shine through, I will rate the songs on this single and you will see why i gave it only 3 stars1. I Believe-This is nothing like it was on the show! I did not feel as touched and i actually got bored with it it is not good at all. *2. Chain Of Fools-This is more like it! It was good, her vocals are at there finest and you can really hear that unique tone of hers. During this song she reminded me of Tina Turner. A huge improvement from I Believe. ****3. Summertime-This is the BEST. This is the best song she ever sung on AI. IT is just as good as it was on the show. *****As you can see i got the three stars by combining them all and dividing by three. All in all this is a good CD the only down point is I Believe"
3,Not Bad,"I bought the CD and must say it's pretty good. Fantasia can really sing and sounds better than on the show. This CD has good songs that include ""I Believe"", ""Chain of Fools"", and Summertime. Highly recommended"
1,listen to a friends copy,fantasia was very good on american idol but did not deserve to win she should have been third or fourth place. summertime was not as good as it was on American idol. fantasia is not a great singer shes a great performer and an okay singer she tends to sound like big bird when she goes for the high notes in I believe.Chain of fools was okay. Theres something missing when I listen to this cd. Fantasia is a lot better when your watching her perform. listening to her sing on a cd is a little difficult. I suggest people keep there $6 and borrow it from a friend if they must listen to it .
1,Dont bother...,"I bought this single even though she wasnt exactly my favorite singer on American Idol figuring Id give her a chance. Big mistake. What a waste of money. Who can put up with this (...)? I can almost expect to see her running across a kitchen floor, broom in hand yelling ""Thomas"" as did the lady in those Tom and Jerry cartoons."
1,Her voice is grating!!,"She sounded like she was singing through her nose throughout AI, and the CD is not any better. No, she will never ever come close to singing as good as Clay - he is almost perfection! I do wish her the best though."
1,Smooth as velevet? I think your ears need a check.,"There is nothing original about Fantasia, everything that she is has already been done by former performers and also currently Macy Gray. Call that talent? She doesn't have anyway. She screeches, and screams, and turns every song into a gospel song. Also, the American Idol is supposed to do POP music. Hence the original show POP idol. Want to do R&B, Hip-Hop and all that bad stuff? Go and try to get a record deal yourself. And also, all the tracks sound the same."
1,Cd just so so,"I bought this CD and it doesn't sound anywhere near as good as the live versions from the show. ""I Believe"" is alright and that's about it. I listen to my taped version now. Maybe my ears have wax in them, but it came across as dull and lifeless. Her voice is good, but the recording isn't."
1,No Fantastic Fantasia!,"I just don't get it! I have respect for her as a person and performer, but that voice, oh it is so terrible! I can't believe that she won American Idol. Her voice is way too shreiky, and the notes are all off key. And what is with all of the added notes like yeah, yeah, yeah? Does that really need to be in there? Hopefully the rest of her cd will be better. Because these songs on the single are really bad!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"During American Idol, I honestly didn't like Fantasia. However, I was sure she would sound great on a record. I decided to buy both Diana's and Fantasia's singles and see who's was better. The result was overwhelming: Diana was far superior. Just listening to both versions of I Believe will prove that. Fantasia has kept the horribly painful things she did in the show, which I thought was just to seem edgy and unique and to get fans. Nope...that's her voice.I Believe is by far the worst of the three songs. The other two deserve probably 2 or 3. But, I Believe actually did hurt my head. The high notes are shreiked, and the ""yeah-yeah-yeah""s every 5 seconds are irritating. If possible, she sounds even more like Donald Duck meets Macy Gray than she did on the show.I had hopes for Fantasia. I thought she'd finally impress me on a CD, but it's even worse. She's irritating, and can't sing very well."
2,No No NO!,"I watched American Idol and scratched my head as I watched Fantasia. Yes, she is a good performer with a lot of charisma. She just has a really horrible voice! She is American Idol 2 reject Kimberly Caldwell without the cheesy moves. Fantasia rarely sang the lyrics to the songs, instead shouted and screeched ""Yeahs"" throught most of the songs. Summertime is all wrong. The girl sounds like a duplicate of Macy Gray, but more nasal."
2,So so,"I am a a big fan of Fantasia ever since she was on American Idol. Ever night she came on she sounded great and her songs were amazing. On this CD the only good song on her is Summertime. She sounded better live then on her CD. Summertime is the only one of those song that is worth listening to. The first 2 songs said ok, those songs dont show why she won American Idol, she sounds like an OK performer. But Summertime is difenatly worth listening to, i say its the only good song on the CD. I was very upset with what I heard. I though this CD was going to blow me away, but it didn't at all. Oh well my loss, i just hope her Album is 50 times better then this"
1,close to ok,"I am not an AI fan, but with so many co-workers who are, I went out and bought both Fantasia's and Diana's CD's. Fantasia is ok but I was disappointed. I am not sure if she sounded better on AI or not. Maybe this was just a ""fluke"" and the next releases will be better for her. Good luck Fantasia...looks like you may need it!"
1,All the fans need to quit,"I understand why people talk about Fantasia's life. American Idol is just about that: being America's IDOL. It's not just about musical talent, it's about how one conducts oneself; should be good enough to be considered an IDOL. (...)My mother thinks she squeaked Chain of Fools too bad that it doesn't sound even close to the original. (...). The show is about being an idol.Fantasia's lucky that being a ""novelty"" was a factor in Fox choosing her for the title. Otherwise if it were based on talent alone (which she doesn't have), she wouldn't even have reached the top 12."
1,Wow,"Right when I listened to her I believe song I though of a cat getting sucked up by a vacuum cleaner, its just terrible!"
1,Fantasia's CD,I listened to a friends copy of this CD and did not care for it. I feel she screems way too much and her Gospel style in EVERYTHING is too much for me.
1,Worse than Hung!,"I did not watch American Idol 3. The judges DO NOT judge, the show is NOT fair and impartial and I just don't understand why they stand by who they stand by. All the critics rave about this girl! Why? Her voice is HORRIBLE! Most of the time she just sings yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I have always been a fan of true vocal talent and I don't hear it here at all! Most of the pop ""singers"" today need vocal enhancement and very rarely sing live because of it. Give me true vocal talent any day. You won't find it here."
1,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,"I say, NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!Fantaisa repeatedly says Yeah! in all her songs. I find her voice very annoying. She is not unique as she sounds just like Macy Gray, but worse. Summertime is okay, but not sung like it should be for Porgy and Bess! The other songs are horrible. Yeah, Yeah, I really mean horrible.(...)"
1,Are you even listening to her sing?,"Anybody who gives Fantasia five stars must not really be listening when she sings. All she does is scream and add numerous ""yeah""s to every single song. There are much better songs and singers out there. Don't buy this."
2,"Decent, but Diana's is better!","Before you buy this single, take a look at Diana DeGarmo's! It's so much better, I've actually listened to both singles. Although Summertime is good, Chain of Fools is screechy and I Believe isn't in the same leauge as Diana's! If you buy this and not Diana's your missing out. At least buy BOTH of them."
1,SHE'S NO LATOYA OR JENNIFER!!,"I always thought Fantasia had talent & stage presence, but couldn't imagine listening to an entire CD of her whiny, nasally screeching, even if she does come from my home town. Sometimes a particular artist's voice just does not appeal to you, though others may love it. This recording does nothing to alter my original view. LaToya London & Jennifer Hudson both displayed much more power & range in the AI3 competition & should have been the final 2. Sorry, Fanny!"
1,Second Macy Gray..Nooooooooo!,"I have respect for her as a person and performer, but that voice, oh it's just not for me! It feels like Macy Gray all over again, one Macy is more than enough thanks!"
1,The Duck flops,"After an undeserved win, Fantasia, in this album that didn't even make half the sales that RUNNER-UP Clay Aiken did, proves why she's a half-hit wonder. She has an ugly voice and an ugly style that barely qualifies as talent. What a joke!"
5,FUNtasia!!,"Hey, I was watching the BET awards last night and realize what it takes to be a star. Fantasia won because she is FUN to watch, listen to, and you feel her genuine emotion coming thru. Diana is so boring. Simon put it best when he said the world loves great singers not just someone who can hit those high notes. Fantasia is a great singer. Competition is rough out there! You can't just be singing ....you have to perform and that is why FUNtasia rightly won the Idol crown. I would crown her again and again and again and again. This girl has diversified talent...she sounds different in each song. I love that. Diana sounds the same all around. So what if she has the pipes...Fantasia has the pipes and more...so much more. There just is no comparison!"
1,Very dissapointing CD,Fantasia sounds even worse on the CD than she does on the show! Something about it being live that makes it better. I can't reccomend this CD.
1,Over-Rated Singer,"Honestly I really don't know what american hear in this singer. I watch all of AI last season and just never thought she could carry a tune, but of course look at about half of the popular singers out their today...most of them can't carry a note either. Most people thought she was fantastic singing summertime...and I said hello is everyone toned death. The music indusrty hasn't been good since around the 80's and after the later 90's came it really went down hill. I could remember buying 8 to 9 out of the top 10 records back in the 80's, now I'm lucky to buy one cd single out of the top 10. With voices like Fantasia it isn't going to get any better."
3,Nice!,Fantasia is a gifted artist who can sing with a unique quality eventhough her song is not my choice of music that I would like to listen too. I am sure that she will go a long way because she has a large fan bases that will help support and buy her cd..all the best of luck for you Fantasia..you deserve to be a star in your own right..
1,I am very disappointed.....,I had a chance to listen to these songs. All I got to say is that I am dissapointed with it..I thought that her voice sounded like cats crying..I have heard better sigers than her..I am sorry but I was expecting better from her.
1,she does screech,"I could not handle her sound on American Idol and I have to say it hasn't changed for her single either. Her voice is extremely screechy. She hits notes and I get the feeling I did in school for someting going down the chalkboard and everything in my body aching. I do like Diana's version. I hope Fantasia does well, it just won't be me helping her. She really needs some help with ennunciating words. It would help in trying to understand what she is saying."
1,GROSSLY OVERRATED...,"I'm sorry, I listened to my demo copy fronted to me by the label, and no. I cannot see it. The voice gets to you...and not in a good way. Some of her phrasing bothered me as well.I was determined to give this an open-minded review...and I'm doing just that. Sorry, it didn't cut it for me. Way too much hype and not enough substance. Definitely a thumbs down."
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this CD thinking it was going to be great by the way everybody talked about it. When i heard her version of I Believe i was like what the hell is this, when she sang that song live si was 10 times better. of course she has to add her horrible yeah yeah yeah and she really does screech through half of the song. Chains of Fool is nothing special either. Once again her Live version is 10 times better as well. It sounds like a karoke song which is not very good. The only song that is worth listening to is Summertime, its the only song that actuallu songs good when she is not screeching through out the song. So overall this CD is not WORTH your money. If you like yeah yeah yeahs, yelling, and shouting then this is your CD but if not dont even bother"
1,she is best LIVE,"I really liked Fantasia on AI3, but seeing her makes all the differnce. She is a great person when you can SEE the emotion she puts into a song. That emotion does not come across in the CD. I would buy a ticket to one of her concerts once she goes solo but I will not buy any more of her CD's."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"I didn't buy this album (Listened to a copy that my friend bought), and it's a good thing. I don't think I could listen to her voice for more than 3 songs. (...)!!"
3,Good single but Fantasia certainly needs more training,"I haven't watched AI3 (since I'm from Hong Kong) but I have listened to both Fantasia and Diana singles, plus I have downloaded some live performance clips to listen. In my opinions, Fantasia is better. The first song ""I Believe"" is excellent and I have listened to it over 100 times. But Fantasia has certainly not received any professional training on music and singing so her performance may not be that good. Anyway, this is just a minor issue and she's got real talent. I believe she can do better if she's got a chance to have some training and to release some more CDs.Posting so many cruel and irrational critics against her are certainly meaningless. Remember she just begins her singing career and we should give her more chance."
2,Needs a bit of work,"Here's my review:I Believe: I truly think Diana's was better. True, they kept the ""Love keeps lifting me higher"" part in Fantasia's, but that in no way affected my opinion.Chain of Fools: Seeing as I already have this on the AI3 compilation CD, I didn't really listen to it on this single, but I know it probably would have been the same.Summertime: I have NEVER in my life liked Fantasia singing this song.Some of you may think I'm a hardcore Diana DeGarmo fan just bashing Fantasia, but the truth is I listened to her CD and I enjoyed it a little, but not as much as Diana."
3,What Went Wrong?,"All three of these songs were performed better live on American Idol. Fantasia has not been served well by bad production and worse arrangements on her first studio release. Particularly disappointing is the instrumentation for ""Summertime."" Did they think her moving rendition of this song on ""Idol"" was too bluesy and should be tricked out? Her voice is still there, but where's the sweet vulnerability that made the audience fall in love with her? Where's the power that awed us? I hope someone out there will know how to treat Ms. Barrino's astounding talent with more sensitivity and respect when she records her first full album. And she deserves a better photographer too."
1,Very dissapointed!!!,"Don't get this CD! Unless you happen to like boring music! I Believe is sappy, Chain of fools is repetative! And Summertime is dead. How did we end up with 2 old songs!????? Fantasia is better than this CD"
1,'I Believe' people who buy this are a 'chain of fools',"... in the 'Summertime'.Even the single titles are a warning to consumers. Buyer beware. This CD is pure crap. 'Chain of Fools' is very karaoke sounding. Summertime we've heard plenty, there is no need to add it on a CD, Fantasia fans should want new material. And then you have that annoying song 'I belive', which is a rip off of about ten different songs.I believe that Fantasia the worst Idol champion in all the world."
5,Best of All AI Winners!,"Fantasia has proven once again why she deserved to win American Idol. She's got mad talent with spunk and pizzazz wrapped around her. I Believe - will make you believe in her and - Chain of Fools - is her funky rendition to Aretha's Queen of Soul hit. -Summertime- is just pure joy! If this CD single is any indication of what her full CD will be, I'll be waiting in line for that one, too. Fantasia is pure talent all around!"
5,A Must Buy,"Firstly, for those who dismiss Fantasia for her different singing style or talent, or her so called 'low education', why can't you judge her by her music?Fantasia is amazing, definitely the deserving winner of American Idol 3. Her voice is different and uplifting, and she has good control over her voice, although sometimes shaky, hence people may see her as screeching.Dispite this small flaw, which by the way, doesn't show in the CD, Fantasia is no doubt a success. Her singing style is different to Diana DeGarmo's, whereas DeGarmo's voice is more mainstream - powerful and strong - Fantasias is more for the niche market.The songs in this CD seems to be tailored for her, Fantasia has shown what she is capable of, and is definitely an achievement, as a must buy!"
5,Amazing Fantasia!,Ever since the first time 'Tasia sang on AI4 I knew she had it! Her vocals are beautiful and she gives me goosebumps every time I listen to her sing. I recommend everyone go out and buy this single a.s.a.p! You wont regret it!
5,money well spent,"I just purchased the Fantasia single. It was money well spent. As usual, Fantasia did not disappoint. Her voice sounds amazing! ""I Believe"" was great with a new verse added, as was ""Chain of Fools"" and ""Summertime""."
5,can't get enough,"each song was great in its own way.....they send chills down my spine, so much heart and soul into her songs."
5,Excellent,"New version of ""I Believe"", it has been extended to 5 minutes, sounds great.""Chain of fools"" and ""Summertime"" are the same versions Fantasia sang on ""American Idol""."
3,Fantasia or Diana,"I have both CD's Diana and Fantasia, my thought..both are good but I like Diana's better..I think these two girls will really go far ..best of luck to both of you.."
4,the best idol debut cd yet,"And I don't say that lightly. Clay Aiken had the best prior to Fantasia's. I didn't like the recorded version of ""bridge over troubled waters"" ( it didn't have the punch of the live performance> which is the only reason fantasia gets a better review from me. All three songs are well performed and well arranged. Yes, ""I believe"" is as weak as all the other American Idol debut songs but Fantasia performs it well. ""Summertime"" is awesome and ""Chain of Fools"" has you bouncing in your seat.I feel that this CD demonstrates Fantasia's range. She could easily have the cross-appeal of say Beyonce, if J records doesn't get it in their minds to just market her as an R&B artist. She can sing anything as AI3 demonstrated. I agree with Simon. Fantasia is potentially the strongest idol yet."
5,Fantastic!,"Great CD single from our 2004 American Idol! 'I Believe' is a corny song but Fantasia sings it with so much passion and spirit, she makes you love it. 'Summertime' is the song that turned me into a Fantasia fan. She is absolutely perfect on this song! 'Chain of Fools' is great too :)"
2,Fantasia lacks tonal quality,"I gave Fantasia an honest try, but I couldn't take her voice for more than a few minutes. She does have style and I give her credit for that, but her tonal quality is too nasal and squeaky. I think Diana DeGarmo's version of ""I Believe"" will appeal to a wider audience."
3,Good.,"I think overall this single is good, Not the best, but reasonably good. Looking forward to her album. I Believe is very good and soulful, although i prefer Diana Degarmo's version, i have learned to respect Fantasias for the heart she puts in it. Summertime is good, nothing tops the show version, but this is one of a kind, so yes it's very good. Chain of fools is okay, shes not quite like Aretha Franklin, she sings it okay. But I don't really like the melody that much"
1,diana may have screamed on part of a song but...,"fantasia, well she just totally WHINES...get over it she can only do two types of music where as diana can do anything at least...i would take screaming on a verse over whining on just about everything...she thinks she about fifteen years older than she really is and needs to get over herself...at least diana was humble...!"
1,"No, not ""Hairspray"" but ""Little Shop of Horrors""!","Her voice would be one of the ""horrors"". This CD is a classic example of what horrific means."
2,"Fantasia, good luck","Summertime is the best on the cd other than that, I really didn't care for the choices that was made on her debut Cd.I think she has more to offer."
3,"Good job, Fantasia!","Fantasia did a good job on ""I believe"" and ""Summertime."" She should have put ""Dreams"" on here instead of ""Chain of Fools"" since that is on the AI 3 compilation cd. I purchased both Fantasia's and Diana's cd's and i like Diana's better. Good, but not great. This is why i'm giving this 3 stars out of 5."
5,This girl is awesome!,"I get chills at the end of ""I Believe."" Tears have come as a result of ""Summertime."" Fantasia has a unique voice which I hope will secure her a long-running singing career. She sings with more emotion than a lot of the artists who sing today, and I use the term sing very loosely. Fantasia can really sing!!! I hope her single does well. I can't wait for her full CD! I hope it's released soon!"
5,Wow!!!,"She is without a doubt the best contestant ever on Americna Idol, closely followed by Clay, Jennifer, and LaToya. This is absolutely amazing!Can't wait for her full CD!!!"
1,Donald Duck Strikes Again!!!,"I was in my friend's car and she was playing Fantasia's CD single. It was awful!!! My ears are still bleeding. I'm amazed that Disney hasn't called her on the carpet for a pat pending violation. She really does sound like Donald Duck. Needless to say, I won't be buying this CD and would tell anyone else not to waste your hard earned money."
1,"America, PLEASE WAKE UP!",This girl has no talent(understandable coming from American Idol). She has an okay voice for broadway but NOT to be a singing star. So stop watching American Idol and go buy some Alicia Keys!
1,Thought a mistake was made...& Minnie actually recorded this,"Absolutely 'unlistenable'!!!If this was recorded by Minnie to impress Mickey then I suppose it wouldn't be all that bad, if not...then, ooh my, what an embarrassment to all involved!The nasality with which this lady performs will probably serve her well if she chooses a career as a voiceover artist in the world of animation...and even those roles will be somewhat limited!If this is a sample of the full length cd to come...that will probably be the ONLY full length cd to come from this...uh...'singer'!'Summertime' USE to be one of all time favorite songs!!!"
1,Not Worth The Money,"I am an Idol fan so I thought that I would give this cd a chance since they usually produce good music, but I was horribly disappointed. Her voice is just so shrill. It doesn't sound like singing, more like shrieking. Chain of Fools is just so repetitious with all the yeah, yeah, yeahs and Summertime is just boring, having heard it over and over on Idol. Her version of I Believe is very uninspiring, too much screeching to really understand the song. I was very disappointed with this being an Idol winners cd, I definitely do not think it was worth the money."
2,"Decent, but save your money","If you want a fair review, come here. I don't think Fantasia Barrino is horrible, but I don't think she's the best either. She has a voice. Unfortunately, it's not always the best voice. She has a fantastic performance style and personality. Her voice is another matter. Sometimes, she tries to hard to sound like Macy Grey and Aretha Franklin. She lacks their soulfulness and power. Kelly Clarkson managed to capture Aretha's power and soulfulness much better. Fantasia can really blow when she needs to. She can really yell and scream. She should not try to be soulful. What she should really do is just rock out and stop trying so hard to be the next Macy Gray or Aretha Franklin."
1,I find her voice annoying,I found her voice annoying on American Idol and I find her voice annoying on this (I listened to it in a friends car). Her voice would get so annoying after only a couple of minutes if you hadn't enjoyed her on American Idol and already formed an opinion of her.
1,Just awful.,"Fantasia, who had a lot of tallent on the show, makes a squeaky, pathetic excuse for a single. I Believe is sung in such a squeaky voice, i love Diana Degarmo's version. Chain of Fools is sung in a no-emotion, boring, donald-duck voice. And Summertime is squeaky, pitchy and dull to listen to. Buy Diana DeGarmo's single instead."
5,Fantasia is beautiful in voice and spirit!,"I absolutely love Fantasia! This CD is wonderful and I can't wait for her full length CD. For those who think she sounds like Minnie, please go to an audiologist and have your hearing checked."
1,Ok - but just not good enough,"I was hoping for more but didn't get it. These singles don't cut it. To many yeahs, not smooth. I like Fantasia but this CD doesn't do it. Hope her release is better. Good Luck."
2,"Sorry Folks, She's A-Screamin'","I pray the handlers will just let Fantasia do her own thing in the future. Even Summertime, which had such understated elegance on AI3, is oversung on this disc. And the ending to I Believe - if she sings that ever time on tuour, this woman will develop vocal problems. That ain't sangin', that's hollerin'"
5,...a beautiful spirit......,"Fantasia throughout ALL performances . . . made the songs her own. She did not disrepect the original artists by changing them, she molded them to a genuinely, unique style that she has,that captivates her audience and captured my heart.Fantasia, you fill my heart every time you speak, sing and dance. Thank you for the joy and faith you show at ALL times.You are a breath of fresh air.God has given you a gift.You are using it well.I have met MANY other fans that you have touched in a way that will change their lives.In that way alone, I have been blessed.Sending the love - Crash :)"
5,Fan from overseas,"Fantasia there will be haters no matter what you do I love your voice, especially the way made Summertime your own. Continue doing your thing and I'm SURE you'll get the last laugh!"
5,Please,"I find Fantasia to be a superior artist, certainly worthy of the title of American Idol. She sings with heart and soul and makes each of these songs her own. Amazon, please delete the reviews with hateful and unnecessary content. No one deserves some of the hateful things that some reviewers have called this young woman. Do you like the cd or not? Why call her names? Let's all pray that the ignorant get a clue and a life."
5,Fantasia sounds fabulous!,"I love this CD! Fantasia Barrino gives her fans a glimpse of her talent on these three tracks. Her voice is so sensual and sultry on Summertime. I'll never get tired of listening to this song. Her voice is so uplifting and inspirational on the track I Believe. Fantasia delivers a sassy soulful rendition of Chain of Fools that would make Aretha Franklin proud. I think Fantasia's powerful voice is able to convey so many different emotions and feelings like happiness, sadness, and confidence. She is an incredible talent. I look forward to hearing much more from Fantasia Barrino in the future."
5,You go girl!!!!!,"I just love ""Summertime"". It reminds me of the old days of good jazz and good singing. I'm still young too, but I do appreciate big band jazz and Fantasia's great voice. You brought a beautiful song to life!"
2,Too many chefs spoil the dish,"Each chapter of the book is written by a different group of authors. Although authors themselves are respectable researchers in the field, this one more looks like a collection of papers rather than a ""book"". Also not all of them are good writers, so some of the chapters are extremely boring. Few concepts are just not explained to the level of detail I would have liked...in short this book gives you a ""high-level"" view. And at least I would not be able to implement any system explained without making my own assumptions. Of course, I should accept that I am not a master of this subject (but then isn't that the reason I am buying this book ?)I will not recommend this book at its given price. Makes no sense to spend $175 on this"
5,The River Knows,As usual JAK AKA Amanda Quick has scored another winner.Fast pace easy read and very good story.
5,Another great book from a truly GREAT author,This was a little change of pace for this author but as always I thoroughly enjoyed the trip and will take it again and again as I have with all of Amanda Quick's books........thanks for another wonderful entrancing tale.
2,rerun,I really enjoy the old Amanda Quick books. I have read most of her books written under her other names (Jayne Castle). The only problem is that she is reusing the plots and scenes from old books. This plot of this book was very similar to her other stories and some of the scene actually reminded me of scenes from her other books. I used to buy Amanda Quick books now I just check them out from the library. She has not written a book for my keeper shelf in years. Basically if you have read Amanda Quick's other books then you have read this one. If you are just looking for something to read then read this. This book is like a loaf of bread-plain but filling. But otherwise look for something else.
3,"just average Victorian that needed a bit more ""umph""","I love Amanda Quick's writing style-smart, funny and very romantic. I high high hopes for her newest book. While the book had it's moments of brillance, the balance of the story was too formulaic to spare the story of it's average appeal. The problem was in the author's attempt to write a ""romance + mystery"", she failed to make either stand out. While the hero and heroine were both likeable characters, not enough time was spent on their burgeoning romance.Don't get me wrong-the good parts were very good, but too much of the same ole same ole made Ms. Quick's newest tome a book look for used, and not a keeper.3 stars."
2,"Boring, plodding, predictable","I really wanted to like this book, and it sounded like it would be intriguing, mysterious and sexy. It wasn't. It was plodding and predictable, with no surprises, and a ""romance"" that seemed especially fake. Left me with the feeling that the author needed to crank one out in order to make some quick cash. Waste of time."
3,Dissappointed,First I will say that I am an Amanda Quick fan and these are the only books that I buy in hardback. This is a good story but I feel that she did a horrible job with her non-existant descriptions of the characters and the scene. It made the story difficult to read and hard to really get into. If she had been more descriptive I would have given it 5 stars.
3,Not enough romance,"This book contains far too much mystery and far too little romance. The love scenes are too forced, and there is no chemistry between the hero and the heroine. There is almost no trademark AQ humor. I bought this book because I had to wait for 8 hours on an airport and needed something to do. I somehow managed to read majority of this book while waiting, but when I got home it took me about a week to read the final few chapters. I just didn't care about what happens. I guess this book is OK for AQ fans, but don't expect too much from it."
4,The River Knows a Good Story,This was an excellent Amanda Quick novel. Full of Intrigue and suspense. The novel with Louisa out to expose Hastings and of course Anthony to find out who killed his fiancee Fiona. There's chemistry between these two. But also deep secrets also. I won't say anymore but to say read this book. You won't regret it.
2,awfully bad!,"There is no suspense, Amanda quick-ly lets us know who the murderer is. Beyond that, the book is padded and padded and padded with extraneous info. I would rate it ""I hate it,"" but the sex scenes are more true-to-life than most."
2,"Boring, boring, boring........zzzzzzzzz.",I think Amanda Quick is in dire need of a new muse. I don't know why I even bothered wasting my money on this book---perhaps because I keep hoping she'll put out a book on par with her earlier work. I never realized that a plot line could be so straight and narrow....and boring! It was almost painful how easy it was to predict what was going to happen.
4,"Great product, use it on my Rv.","Nice sign, I put it on the back of my Rv. I would purchase again . The price was right."
3,yawner,I don't think that guy from San Antonio reads to many mystery books because thier is nothing original in this book from the beginning to the end. It's so predictable
1,"Hey, look...we're all the same color!","I thought this movie was bad, at first. It had no plot, cheesy recycled effects, bad acting, themes of racism to please the masses, no suspense, and last, video in rewind that was supposed to look like it was going forward! My favorite! But then, I realized that by the end, this movie was up there with Starship Troopers. I broke at least 4 ribs laughing. If you want a good movie to ridicule forever...if you're always the guy cracking jokes, and people tell you to shut up...if you liked MST 3000, you'll get this DVD and enjoy giving Tommy Lee (Jones) the mocking of his life."
1,"""Everybody's the Same!""","This movie is horrible. Mediocre action flick at best- and what totally kills it is the forced morals it beats over your head. Movies like this do not need to have Rodney King references and other social issues: it's a brainless action flick. I have no problem with films that explore social issues- Spike Lee has had some thought provoking films, and ""Crash"" was an excellent example. However, movies like ""Volcano"" are so silly and so over the top that at the end of the movie all of our social ills are solved because everyone is covered in volcanic ash? When the little kid smiles and says ""Everybody's the same"" and the mushy music starts playing- this is pure Hollywood at its worst. This movie has little to recommend it to begin with- as action/ disaster flicks go, it's very mediocre to begin with. Throw in the contrived, cornball ""moral"" element, this is a god- awful movie. This movie is good for one thing: inducing vomitting."
2,Cheer for the Volcano!,"This is a hilariously BAD ""Can't we just all get along?"" GoldenTurkey movie. Once you get past the preposterous notion of alava-flowing volcano coming up out of Mid-Wilshire's Museum District,this movie is so bad, it's funny, especially if you arefamiliar with the LA area, then you can cheer and throw popcorn,as your favorite or hated sites are wasted. Slogan was great,""The Coast is Toast,"" and worth getting together a bunch offriends and having a Golden Turkey festival party of your own.I cheered the volcano on, it was the best actor! Best scene waswhen the suits all looked around to see who's cell phone hadgone off.Best enjoyed with friends and some cold brewskis at a party."
2,"Lame, lame, lame.","Okay, so a volcano is forming under Los Angeles, and nobody manages to really figure this out until it's just about to explode. Pretty soon, folks are running from flying hot rocks, and magma lakes are having their way with the city of angels. It sounds exciting, but it isn't. For such a calamity, this felt so fake, with cheesy effects, dialogue and story, that I never got into it.Dante's Peak is better."
4,VOLCANO ROCKS L.A. & DVD!,"I see it at the theater,rented on video and finally I bought it on DVD!this is a awesome movie,cool lava flowing the street of L.A. is like the real lava.Tommy Lee is a wonderful actor and also Anne Heche too.The DVD transfer is also awesome,good sharp picture quality and sound.This is the DVD to get for your home theater system."
4,sueob,I happen to like Tommy Lee Jones so I enjoy just about anything he is in. The special effects were good and it portrayed the women as strong characters.
5,valcano rocks on!,I love the movie valcano. I recemend it only to people who like horror and death movies becuse valcano is one of them. I hope kids don't really belive that this has happend becuse there has not ever been a valcano so powerful to blow up so much ash and magma to destruct a whole state and more than that so dont belive this happend. I will like this movie so much I am willing to pay for 2 copys of it if I had that kind of money but I dont so dont think I will.
1,"awful, awful, awful [...]","i think everything that needs to be said about this movie has already been said. i actually couldn't bear to watch it right through so maybe it suddenly got really good right after the bit where the guy's hanging off a firetruck ladder over an advancing lava flow which is so hot his shoes are melting, but the metal of the ladder is still somehow cool enough to hold onto with bare hands.i gave one star because there's no zero-star option."
5,Great Action,"In this movie we are taken to a new horror, a volcano in the center of LA. Wow, who would have thought and could this be possible? We have almost gotten numb to the reports of earthquakes hitting that part of our country, but this is a new twist. Tommy Lee Jones is excellent in this flick and always brings something special in any movie he is in.I think the effects were pretty good and all in all this to me was a good adventure movie and with an interesting twist.Shirley Johnson"
4,Ehhh,Oldie but goodie. Very interesting movie plot doesn't come up too often. Nothing like seeing actors that are awesome now starting up. Don cheadle was great in this!
3,Pick a subject!!,"Give me a break!! This story has sooo many subplots and underlining themes that they can hardly resolve all of them. I do not object to movies pushing the envelope, but a man CAN NOT walk though lava. It is just impossible. ALso, there is no possible way that concrete dividers will stop the flow of a lava. SHEESH!!! I love Tommy Lee Jones but this was ridiculous. My advise, pass on this politically correct nonsense and watch something a little more believable, like Dante's Peak. It has some DUH! moments but at least it is plausible."
3,"inally, another city besides New York City being destroyed!!","As a fellow New Yorker, almost every single disaster movie features New York City being swept away by a tidal wave (""Deep Impact""). stomped to death by a monster (""Godzilla"" [1998]) or being blown up by meteorites (""Armageddon""). ""Volcano"" focuses on a volcano in Los Angeles. Although the movie was mediocre, I was glad to see that the director was interested in destroying another city other than NYC."
3,Second-rate Dante's Peak,"The movie is entertaining and fun, but not very serious at its subject matter. The effects and suspense have some catching up to do with the superior Dante's Peak."
3,Tommy Lee Jones and His Disaster,"This movie is tacky. It is the ""adventure story"" flip-flop of the year. It had no sence of imagination, a four year old could have thought this one up! It was totally predictable and, it was boring. This movie is to seriouse you can predict everything you fall asleep during the whole thing and it's just plain bad, if you want a good movie with Tommy Lee Jones in it go get Men In Black. Ha Ha Ha!"
1,"as george put it ""My stupity finally rewarded""",But could stupity be rewarding in real life? doubt it.This movie is joke and painful to watch as some folks said.
2,Dante's Peak is better,"Anne Heche almost single-handly ruins this movie with her horrible over acting. Tom Lee Jones shows his one dimensional acting style and the rest of the cast submits mediocre performances as well. About the only thing done well was the lava, and I was rooting for it envelope Anne Heche and Tom Lee Jones in a fiery death. Unfortunately, they survive. This movie also trys to force a ""we are the world"" kind of theme, but showing how confronting lava can *gasp* bring people together in the force of adversity. A contrived plot device that could have definitely been left out. I think Dante's Peak captured a more realistic tone - when the eruption comes its pretty much everyone for themselves! If you do watch this movie, just watch it to root for the lava to destroy LA."
5,"once again, a gift","I received the movies quickly, as stated - No problems.I was able to pass it on quickly, a it was a gift - No problem."
2,zzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzz zzzzz oh its finished!,"This movie is sooooo boring, only because the same thing is happening over and over and over again and it just goes on and on and on....Its boring, dont bother with it!"
2,Tommy Lee's had better,These 2 movies came out within months of each other and after watching Dante's Peak and I couldn't help but feeling disappointed by this one. Although it does have some great visual effects I couldn't get past all of the yelling. All I can say is did they have to kill the dog couldn't they have left that part out?
2,AN OKAY BUT NOT GREAT ACTION-DISASTER FILCK,VOLCANO with TOMMY LEE JONES AND ANNE HECHE is okay but not great film. I mean the special effects in this film are the only things that save it. I really hated the weak diaolouge between the characters weither they were major or minor it did'nt really grab me and make me want to rally behind these people who were up against nature at it's worst. My advice is if you want a great action-disaster filck see ARMAGEDDON instead.
2,Background hum is a problem,"A good deal, but the background hum listed in the 'Cons' is certainly that. Since I planned to use this phone as my primary, I am returning it and will have to find some other product. This is too bad, as my other Uniden products have always been top notch.I am surprised they did not withdraw this phone from the market."
2,"If this were a car, it be a gas guzzl'n one","I really like the features of this phone.However, because of the power drain on the battery(I have 2), I'd replace it in a heartbeat."
1,Bad Hand Set,"The 1,2, and 4 buttons on the unit failed after minimal usage. I also own the same model without the digital recorder. This unit experienced the same problem. Uniden service claims that they never heard of this problem before. Not likely if both of my units have the same problem. The only option is to buy a... replacement handset. I have a better idea. Buy a new system from a more better supplier."
3,It could have been better,It's a great phone that is very durable. It lack some feature like a larger Phone Book where you can search a number by Name.
3,Came up short,"Sleek styling, great options for the money. However, the background noise is worse than my 10 year old Panasonic which sits directly next to every electrical appliance that interfers with cordless phones."
4,only minor complaints,"This phone is packed with all of the features I was looking for; however, there are a few annoying things about it. The first is that both the line 1 and line 2 buttons light up when either line rings. Also, there is no indicator if someone is on one of the lines -- the only way to find out is to try to pick up a line and see if the phone beeps at you. My last gripe is with the caller ID. It doesn't automatically display the name and number when the phone starts ringing but rather requires an extra button press. Other than these things the phone seems good."
2,Lousy battery life...I mean LOUSY!!!,"DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!! Ignore all the other review claims about this phone providing decent battery life...they're absolutely not true! I purchased this phone about a year ago or so and initially the battery life was acceptable, and I could talk for over an hour with no problems. About 6 months ago the battery life plummeted. The reason is because the batteries are crummy nickel cadmiums that suffer from memory effect. Now I have less than 15 to 20 minutes of talk time. All the other features are well-done but avoid this phone unless you want to have every other call interrupted with a failing battery."
2,Poor Battery Life,"After reviewing Consumer Reports I decided to purchase the EXS 9960 and the EXS 9966...big mistake. Though the range and sound quality have been satisfactory, the battery life is poor at best. What is so disappointing is that I followed the instructions word for word. In addition I purchased additional batteries for each phone under the assumption that I would run the phone/battery down then have a fresh, recharged battery waiting in the wings. I purchased the phones less than a year ago and they both fail to get me through more than 30 minutes of talk time."
1,Missing Feature,"Uniden makes great phones - have been buying them for years but this one is a reject for one simple reason... while it is a 2-line phone, it only has *one* on/off ring setting for both lines. I can't turn off my teenagers line #2 on the master bedroom phone!!!"
4,"Excellent interpretation, questionable sound","Of the available Elgar 2nd symphonies, this one must rank among the top in terms of performance and interpretation. Davis-LSO are in excellent form here throughout. They have established a great relationship over the years, and that experience is easily heard here. This release is early in the LSO Live series, but sounds like it might have been recorded through a door. The sonics are poorly captured here with a narrow dynamic range, thick bass, and a shrill treble. It is by no means a failure, but in comparison to other LSO Live productions, this one is at the back of the pack. Highly recommended for interpretation."
4,Light and Funny,"For a slightly different, light hearted comedy, try Frozen Assets. It will put a smile on your face without a lot of foul language and nudity."
3,Simply funny!,This is a typical Shelly Long movie in which she plays a small town doctor assisting those with fertility problems. In comes Corben Bernsen and Larry Miller and the antics begin. This movie is a feel good movie that is incredibly funny in its simplicity.
3,Fair movie with great title,Even its great cast cannot make this a good movie. I must say that it makes some important points that deserve further thought.
1,ONE OF THE *WORST* FILMS EVER MADE,It is absolutely unbelievable how truly awful this film is--'Frozen Assets' is easily one of the WORST films ever made. This movie is so bad that it's beyond comprehension.(Almost worth seeing for the broad strokes of undiluted incompetence this film was brushed with.)
1,Absolutely Atrocious!,"Shelly Long and Corbin Bernsen worked well in Hello Again, but this was a complete disaster. Unless you like Larry Miller, (from The Nutty Professor, Undercover Blues, and For Richer or Porrer) who was hilarious in this, the only good thing in the movie, I seriously reccomend skipping it."
1,Would you Rather,"I like the idea of the game but the game itself is not what I had in mind. I was looking for something I could sit around a table and have some fun with family and friends. Many questions are subject matters I would not ask my family or friends so I thought about throwing away the cards that were applicable, then just thought it was a lesson learned."
5,hilarious!!!!,"this game is ADULT rated and VERY fun! each card asks ""would you rather..."" questions that have to do with 5 different categories 1)pain/fear/discomfort 2) appearance/embarrassment 3)food/indigestion 4)ethics/intellect 5)random questions.there are some sexually referenced questions. so make sure no kids are around. i brought this game to party and it was a hit. people still ask me to bring this game over. its a great way to break the ice, get people interacting and get a party started. i HIGHLY recommend this game."
3,Best for adults,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband because he loves making up his own ""would you rather"" questions. Before thoroughly examining the game, we brought it to a party, and it was kinda awkward. They really mean it when they say ""twisted, sick, and wrong"". There were questions that involved genetalia, so be mindful of who you want to play this game with or purchase it for."
5,Best book for your life,"If you are really interested to understant the satellite systems, and this is the best of the books for you. The book give you a lot of in deep infomation of the satellite system and have a lot of calculation. The calculation is not easy to understand at all, so this book is not good for the beginner."
2,I'm Sorry Jessica... Really I am!,"The only Reason I gave this disc a chance was for 'A Public Affair'. And as i thought, that was the only song worth praise. Her song 'I belong to me"" is also Really great but that is only available through imports or iTunes. The rest of the songs sound like madonna had a fight with her CD's. Sorry Jess."
1,Behind the scenes at the recording studio,"Jessica: how much longer do I have to be here? You've made me stay at this studio for 45 minutes. Making an album shouldn't be so hardProducer: not much longer, we just need one more off key squeal from you. Then I'll pro tools it, have the backup singer re sing it. but all that will be done after you're gone.Jessica: making music is hard.Producer:well someone else wrote it, someone else picked the song, other people played it, I told you how to sing it, we'll have backup singers cover your bad voice, and the engineer will mix it.Jessica's Dad: you're fired!"
1,Um... what happened?,"I love good old disco and 80s/90s pop but does anyone else think that pop lately has been getting, well boring? It seems the past few years its the same old thing over and over again. Yes, the 80s are back but if we want to listen to 80s music we have a huge collection spanning over 10 years, we don't need an updated version. This album is horrible and boring. I really tried hard to like it but I am so shocked how Jessica isn't taking her talent UP to a new level and mature a bit. Her older albums have more validity then this one. By habit I always buy her albums, but this one taught me a lesson to wait next time... this one is being donated to the library. Sorry"
1,Yes. she is pretty. But you can't see her when this dribble is being played.,"I honest to god can't believe this woman has a recording contract. She has a weak, very average voice that I'm sure is digitally enhanced and lip synced for live performances. She appeared on this years Kennedy Center Honors. Her performance was so bad, it had to be edited out of the program that was broadcast on CBS. Does that tell you anything?"
1,Just plain terrible,"After listening to the tracks online, I've come to a very similar conclusion as the rest of the reviewers below: Jessica Simpson is a no-talent failure. America, please stop rewarding such nonsense and support REAL artists."
1,Generic at best,"You know, anyone could be singing this album. The only reason it's selling is because Jessica Simpson's name is pasted on it. Despite what others have said, maybe she should stick to power ballads - become the young Celine Dion - because when she's singing upbeat songs, there is not a modicum of talent or ability involved."
3,Some good tunes,"It's got some good songs, but some don't sound like her. All in all, it's worth the money, and there are some good breakup songs - obviously. The photos are cool too. For coming out of a recent breakup, great job, Jess!"
1,Always a Fan...But NOT impressed this time!,I could do without this new CD. I just dont like this new style she is trying to go with. This album is nothing compared to Nick's. I wouldnt waste your money unfortunately on this one.
4,pretty good and fun.,"This album is pretty good. It leaves a little to be desired though. The songs are fun but not very well written. I think that Jessica is so talented and this album doesn't really allow her to demonstrate that. the rest of the album is not really as good as the single ""public affair"" but it still holds it's own. It has a few songs that are similar but just aren't as catchy. It's a good song to listen to for girls that could use a little empowerment. It makes you feel sexy and fun and cheers you up. overall it's a pretty good cd."
2,This album should have been a lot better,"This album had the potential to be considerably better than it is. Don't let the first single fool you, the rest of the album isn't all that great. I will say that ""Between You And I"" is very beautiful and will probably be played at a lot of weddings.Simpson's rendition of ""You Spin Me 'Round"" is not just a cover, she's changed the lyrics so it isn't even the same song anymore!"
2,Get Christina Instead,"I don't know what happened to Jessica Simpson. She used to have a strong and impressive singing voice. It seems now that she tries too hard to incorporate sex appeal, really throwing off her sound. The album lacks a true flow, with no unifying sound between all the tracks. Many are nothing more than bubblegum 80s throwbacks. If you want to spend your money well, buy Christina Aguilera's new CD instead."
3,It's OK......,"Sometimes I wish Jessica & Ashlee would collaborate on an album. Ashlee's just seem more polished, although they have totally different styles.The highlights of the album are three songs: ""Between You & I"", ""Let Him Fly"" and ""I Belong to Me"". To me, Jessica soars on slow songs, that is when she is at her best. These are great songs. Glad that ""I Belong to Me"" was her 2nd single. ""If You Were Mine"" is also a good tune.The downfall songs: ""Push Your Tush"", ""Fired Up"", and ""B.O.Y"". I've never really been a fan of her faster songs (minus ""A Public Affair""). ""Fired Up"" is a total waste. Scott Storch did a much better job with Paris Hilton's Music, believe it or not.To me, Jessica has the capability of being one of the greatest singers of all time. She just needs to get the right writers/producers in her corner. I see Jess performing in Vegas any time now. She may be better off in that direction."
2,This CD is disappointing,"In my opinion, this CD is very disappointing. It was like, because Nick put one out, she wanted to hurry and get one out too or something. At least that's what it sounds like. Her stuff when she was with Nick was much better. It has been a couple years since her last CD so I was expecting more. I listened to it the first time I got it and I hate that she is like a cover artist. I mean even her last CD she did a remake of ""Take My Breath Away"" by Berlin. It appears that she (or her song writers for that matter) cannot come up with anything original for her so she just sings other people's stuff. I was a huge Jessica Simpson fan, but this CD makes me think different."
1,Could have been better... A complete bore...,"The reviewer below is correct. Jessica has a beautiful voice. But her songs lack that certain commercial ""hook"" that has been a proven success for Britney and Christina. What comes to mind is that Jessica haas only a couple of hits, whereas the others have numerous hits... I think Jessica needs to hire a better songwriting team... Oh yeah, the covers gotta go... Once in a while is ok."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this album. I was looking forward to hearing ballads and a few uptempo beats but not the ode to the 80s I got.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I like Jessica's vocals much better on this CD, because they aren't so over the top as in her last one. The change in style suits her, and it sounds like she had FUN making this album. Not every song is great in my opinion, but everyone has different taste, right? By the way, I am 44 years old."
4,A Mostly Enjoyable Affair...,"Let's face it. Jessica could've made an album full of drippy ballads like her ex-husband. But instead, she's given us exactly what we want: a disc that's (for the most part) fun dance-pop. I certainly didn't want to hear her sing about her divorce. She clearly feels the same. And even though there's a few ballads, she's sings them with great maturity and restraint. Nothing over-the-top or overblown. Most of this 55-minute album is lightweight, effortlessly catchy, and club-ready. From 80s inspired pop to beat-heavy, Eastern-tinged hip-hop, it's all there. All in all, it's Jess' most enjoyable album yet!"
1,This album is AWFUL,"I bought this album, after hearing the hype about it. I thought maybe Jessica's voice had matured. But it is the same over-singing, lack of talent, try anything to make a buck rubbish.Do NOT buy this CD, it is terrible. I can't believe I wasted my money on it!"
2,2 stars for trying,"I hate to give Jessica Simpson's CD a horrible review, but she has given me no choice. I loved Jessica Simpson's CD ""In This Skin"" so I was excited about this album. I was very disappointed. The lyrics are weak and her voice rarely hits the famous Jessica Simpson pitch that some people found annoying, but made Jessica Simpson, Jessica Simpson. I do not recommend this album."
1,"bland, boring, and blah","there are so many great young, women solo artist out there, that write their own inspiring music, that I can't see why anyone (over the age of 7) would spend money on a jessica-type artist. visit a music section today and by any album from tori amos, fiona apple, or nora jones. they will impress and inspire you.go away jessica, ashlee, and clay and let a real artist take over."
5,GREAT!!!,"It is not the typical Jessica Simpson CD, but either way this is a great CD. She shows off her amazing voice and she still wants to make you dance in some of her tracks. I think she did an amazing job with this CD!"
1,Mickey mouse and Bubble gum,Her tweenie fans should love this album. I just wonder when the music is going to grow up!Her good looks and pushy father are owed much of the credit for her continuing success.I liked her as the comic relief with ex hubby better!
5,Say what you will.. (so will I!),"Okay.. maybe the stupidest person in showbiz.. but JS has great producers! Yup.. she samples (read steals) rifts and full songs from other artists, but so what? This CD is the best one of the whole summer.. its what you hoped Christina and Paris would have been, but fell short. And, if Paris can steal a Rod Stewart song, no matter who her best friends father is, its the same thing.. same with Christina.. hello - Candyman on the second disc - Bette Midler's Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy anyone? I think its time we stop teasing Jessica Simpson and listen up - this CD is well worth it!"
1,What Happened??,"I think Jessica had the potential to make a great album, but this album is terrible! The first single, A Public Affair, is catchy and fun. The rest of the songs on this album are dreadful. I don't even know what style she is trying to do on this album; it is such a mess!! I was excited to purchase this album, but after one listen, I feel I made a terrible mistake. Just very disappointing, because I was expecting SO much more."
1,a voice with no direction,"Jessica simpson has some talent,but is missing the right direction at getting it all together. the material here is all over the place&very cliched. the title track is a knock off of Madonna's ""Holiday""&the Groove never catches on. Jessica is more Celine Dion than She is Britney Spears&yet She isn't anywhere near Celine Dion in terms of reaching her vocal goals as a Artist.She has pop appeal,but doesn't have the right Writers&producers to properly channel her musical talent. it is hurting her as a Artist. this Album is lame."
4,Sparkles And Shines,"Glamourous, beautiful and truely talented Jessica Simpson shines away from her other pop princess counter-parts in many ways and this album proves this. It's common knowledge that it hasn't been an easy year for Jessica but unlike ex-hubby Nick, Jessica bounces back from a rough divorce sparkling and shining brighter than her ""Juicy Dessert"" lip-gloss. Where Nick's album dwells on the past and is just one long boring ballad Jessica's is full of pop-infused club tracks and beautiful ballads proving Jessica's amazing vocal talents. However, this is not to say that the album is without flaws, ""Fired Up"" is truely a mess and ""Let Him Fly"" is hard to listen to but with songs like ""A Public Affair"", ""B.O.Y"" ,""If You Were Mine"" and ""I Belong To Me"" it's hard to notice the albums' flaws."
3,A little bit better than expected...not bad at all.,"This album is not so bad and it's a whole lot better than her previous album. I remember when IN THIS SKIN was released and I thought it was a terrible album. A PUBLIC AFFAIR is a mixture of pop and R&B and there are some songs that really stand out. She's worked with great producers such as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Cory Rooney, and Scott Storch. I believe these producers gave the album the lift it needed to make the album solid. A PUBLIC AFFAIR is not Jessica's best, but it's a decent album and I believe it's good enough for more than one listen."
2,Forgetable Album,There just wasn't much to this album that I could get excited about. It all just sounds like filler except for a few of the slower songs. I would definitely recommend listening to this before buying it even if you are a Jessica Simpson fan.
4,Fantasy,"Jessica,Jessica,Jessica if there really was a woman as pure and as sweet and simple but stylish as she pretends to be every manwould be happy, but alast, it is but a Show, a Fantasy. enjoy. simple, sweet,sometimes too sweet, but that is Jessica and that is her music."
1,"Love her, but...","I adore Jessica Simpson!!! But this album is seriously lacking in originality. Why, oh why, do artist insist on re-making songs?!? Unless it's a Christmas song, it just doesn't work. At least for me it doesn't. Don't waste your money on this album, but definitely buy one of her others."
5,Great album Jessica Rocks,this was a great album the song were catchy and each had it own meaning anybody who didnt like this must be crazy
2,what's the public to think,"I was never a big jessica fan and this disc didn't make dislike her anymore than before but confirmed that all she is, is a girl singer someone who is pretty and can hold a note and sing on key and if you are looking for that in music then i suggest getting this cd."
1,Want to laugh...then listen to this album,"A hysterical attempt at a publicity rushed album that is a total joke. Don't waste your money....wait for a few weeks, it'll be available in the $0.99 bin at wal-mart."
5,"You did a great job, Jessica!! THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!!","In my opinion, ""A Public Affair"" has got to be one of the best albums that Jessica Simpson has EVER put out!! I just LOVE listening to it!! Why anybody would think otherwise is just...weird. Unlike some people, I'm proud to own this album. I definately got my money's worth!!"
2,Tragic,"Jessica is blessed with a powerful and beautiful voice, but you won't get the chance to hear it on this CD. This CD is a complete let down. It is her worst one yet! Don't get me wrong. I love Jessica, but seeing her waste her God given gift on a bunch of kitty cat songs is just so... tragic."
1,Worst CD I ever heard.,"OK. First I didn't buy the CD. I listen to them at Yahoo music subscription that I have.The first single was obviously a Madonna rip off. Surprised she didn't get sued yet. The remake of Dead or Alive song was the worst. Why make a remake if you're going to make it sound worst. I like couple songs before she did in the past but this CD just sucks so bad that I listen to the whole CD in 5 minutes.Kids, don't waste your money."
1,Wow it sucks.,Don't bother getting this album. This is her worst album ever. Theres gonna be a lot of dissappointed fans. Could have been better if she didn't sing using the voice she did. After a while this cd put me to sleep.
1,A Boring Affair: Avoid at all costs,"There is a thin line between paying homage to an era, and completely ripping off one song after the other. This entire album is an exercise in song recycling and bad production. The album tries to come across as laid back and fun, but instead seems forced and desperate. Jessica has never really made any real waves with her music, and this album cetainly won't be changing that.With opening sales close to those of Paris Hilton's debut, this could very well be the last album we here from jessica."
3,Jessica's Shot At History,"I believe expectations for Public Affair were kinda high, because of the preceding single doing better than anyone thought it would. In my opinion Jessica is showing growth. She hasn't fully developed her voice, but she is definately stepping out of your comfort zone with this album. The original title, ...And The Band Played On would definately describe where she is coming from with this album. Their is country, pop, r&b, folk mix into an interesting album. It's no where near Back to Basics, but it's definately showing that Jessica belongs with the leading ladies of pop."
2,Simply not Back to Basics...,I like Jess so much that it is difficult to say that her last album is BAD!2stars because i like U!LOLPlease Jess you have to do your own things...like Christina and for sure your next album will be as perfect as Back to basics.!
2,Surprisingly Dissapointed,"I am a huge Jessica Simpson fan-for her music and not her personal escapades! I own every album she has made, and I anxiously await each new one. So of course when this album came out I snagged it up and looked forward to hearing those beautiful ballads that she does so well! She produces hearfelt songs and eliquently written ballads like no one else I have ever heard! This CD was a dissapointment to me...the only song that was like her ""usual style"" was ""Between You and I""and I absolutely love that song! But everything else was all over the place. In my opinion she is trying too hard to become an upbeat club kinda singer and that just does not work for her-or it is not what she does well! She needs to stop trying to be what the other artists are because she is not successful with her ""club"" attempt at music."
1,Disappointing,"I was expecting a fun CD that I could pop in when I'm getting ready for a girls night out, but was extremely disappointed. There was only one song that made it worth buying and that is the cover of Fly."
2,Music Overpowers,"Regardless of the fact that I love Jessica Simpson, this CD doesn't live up to the others, namely Sweet Kisses and In This Skin. The music really overpowers her voice, particularly in Spin Me 'Round (Like a Record). You Belong to Me is possibly the best song on the album. A Public Affair is a good summery song, like if you're in the car with your girlfriends on a road trip, but beyond that, it's not so catchy. If you're not a dedicated JS fan, skip on this one."
1,bad,"This album has a bit of everything. Jazz, pop, dance, and disco. All tracks equally as horrible. I miss the days when Jessica could sing. Now she does this thing with her voice that I can't stand."
1,Bad Album,I own all of Jessica Simpsons CD and this one is the worst one. Her voice is totally winy and her music never changes. She has one tone and one tone only. You can't really understand her because she tries too hard. Her voice is odd....I can't stand her music. No wonder it doesn't sell.
1,ugh is she over yet,someone get her vocal lessons! completelt unoriginal and oversung... dont waste your money
1,No artistic talent,"No thought, feeling, artistic anything in this cd. She's trying to ride on her tabloid popularity and hoping that people will go out and buy this cd. Good Luck."
5,The one to own,This is the last Dharma Bums album I heard and by far my favorite. All of their music is very listenable but this really got my attention.
2,Not what was expected and received too late,"The pictures of this carrier is very deceiving. We thought it was a billet piece and it was tubing welded together and then chromed.It did arrive in a Honda box and was a Honda piece but it had no hardware and didn't fit the Honda backrest and mounting brackets that were on our VTX 1300. There were no installation instructions letting us know what brackets they were designed for.Not only that, but it took more than 2 weeks for us to receive our product. We were getting ready to take a long ride and we didn't get the product in time. Now I'm afraid that we are going to have to pay a restocking fee to get the right bracket. If there had been more information available, we may have been able to make a much wiser decision."
1,stopped working...3 times. It's out.,"We bought this unit new. It had to be serviced twice while under warranty. The sensor that knows if the door is shut went bad, shutting down the unit, the second time, another sensor or fuse went bad shutting off the unit.Now we are out of warranty and it is dead again.Time to try a different unit."
1,"Piece of Junk, Caught Fire","Mine is just like many of the other posts I've read about Sharp microwaves ""shorting out"" and actually catching fire...... Unfortunately, I only read those reviews after this happened to us...................Exactly two weeks after the warranty expired. Went to heat a cup of water and BRRRRRRRRZZZZZZZZZZ............... Flames were shooting out the from the inside......... had a repair estimate and it would be almost 3/4 of what I paid originally!Save your money! This is a piece of junk!!!"
4,Review for Vladimir Nabokov by David Rampton,I read this book when I had my military training. I must admit that it really gave me much fun and I found fantastic items in those not so famous Nabokov novels such as Mary that I had not seen before. But to most expertised Nabokovians it provides less information than it should have.
3,Not particularly engaging,"This seems more to be a book of psychology than actions. I found it difficult to become interested in the plot, which had continuity but lacked spark. Greene emphasizes the inner bitterness of the main character, but the personal transformation was not as touching or dynamic as it should have been. The grossness of Raven's deformity sticks with the reader, and the scenarios are painted expertly, as usual, but this one just lacks...Oomph."
4,A Greene's enterteiment,"The author He is right in calling this book an enterteiment. Probably wirtten when he was young. He does not tell the reader anything deep or serious, but you will have a good time reading the adventures of a crimilal who for a while you like. A good book to read at the side of a pool while you enjoy a refreshin drink"
5,Head and shoulders above the rest,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. This live recording by the Alban Berg Quartet is simply astonishing. In particular the Quartet in G major gets its best-ever interpretation, full of character and expressiveness. I've heard many recordings of this piece over the years, including by the Busch Quartet, the Emersons, and the Quartetto Italiano, but the work truly comes to life here. They make a strong case for this being one of the very greatest quartets ever composed. The recording is also beautifully balanced and detailed - you can hear the nuances of each line clearly. I'll go so far to say that this is one of the best quartet recordings that I own, period. I'm so glad that I tracked this one down!"
5,"exquisite, must have schubert / alban berg quartett","with the alban berg quartett/schubert string quartets nos. 10 & 14/emi and the alban berg quartett/brahms piano quintet & 1 movement fron dvorak piano quintet cds, this represents glory manifest. almost as powerful is the alban berg quartett/dvorak string quartets opp. 51,105. >>>these are recordings of classical music as secure in their place in cultural history as a diego velasquez painting or a major architectural work such as the statue of liberty in nyc harbor. blessings from geniuses of worth in music. they sit near the top of classical music and await melody pleasure-seekers. >>>thank you to santa fe listener for cogent, well-reasoned reviews that bring these treasures to public light. history lives in both the cds and in the reviews that raise their profiles. schubert / brahms / dvorak - giants of chamber music excellence. the alban berg quartett is superb and sparkles. do not deny yourself these nutritious treats!"
5,"awesome!,,",This movie has kept most of its appeal since it first came out... Slower than most current movies... It feels more like an introspective play. Take a chance - I highly recommend it!
3,enemy mine,This movie was really(well maybe not really) good when it was first released - I remember my husband and I saying we liked it - pretty good - or something like that - but I could not sit through it this last time - kinda dated now.
4,"Good movie, a true tale of friendship","""Enemy Mine"" was one of the good movies of the 80's. It's about an alien called a Drac (Louis Gossett, Jr.) and a human (Robert Quaid), who's species are brutal enemies. But they must learn to cooperate with each other to survive on the barren planet that they both crashed on.""Enemy Mine"" is a good movie in just about every way. The special effects, landscapes, and aliens are great. Quaid and Gossett Jr. also do a good job of acting. The movie drastically changes when one of them has a baby. If you like sci-fi movies, ""Enemy Mine"" would be a good movie to get. My only complaint is that it didn't have much action in it like many other classic sci-fi movies, but it's still a good movie."
1,Product didn't work,"This is one of my favorite movies, but the DVD has a bad sector and can not be played on a dvd player or computer. This is the problem with buying online. It is a hassle to return or get your money back on shotty products. Oh, well, next time I go to a store. Thanks."
4,I enjoyed this weird movie,"Two of them crash land both are ok, one is ready for being a father or mother."
3,Didn't Care for Last 30 Minutes. 36 out of 100.,"The first hour of the movie I would give 5 stars. The interaction between the human and Drac was well done. The last 30 minutes deteriorated into cheesy dialogue and action sequences, as if they were necessary to make this a ""real"" sci-fi film. I would give the last 30 minutes 1 star. Worth watching.Total Score (out of 100) = 3619 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.5 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?6 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?3 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?3 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?"
3,"Boy, this premise sounds familiar! Rehash, anyone?","I haven't seen this in a long time, but isn't this basically the same idea as the 1968 Lee Marvin/Toshiro Mifune war drama ""Hell in the Pacific?"""
3,Another Classic Sci-Fi Flim For Anyone,"What if two enemies both from alien races crash landed on a deserted planet in the middle of a waging war? Would they work together as a team to survive long enough to be rescued? Or would they not be able to settle their differences and wage their own war? Enemy Mine starring Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. gives us this very scenario. Enemy Mine's story is great, and the special effects and makeup are great for their time also. I'd suggest this movie for anyone who is looking for more than just a ""Shoot em' up, Blow em' up"" type Sci-Fi movie. Three stars."
3,It's not quite the book,"I first saw this movie over 15 years ago but purchased it because it belongs in any good sci-fi collection. I liked it then and I still enjoyed it today.It is, in the strictest sense, a variation of ""Robinson Carouso on Mars"", but if you had read the book (which would have filled in some of the gaps), ""Enemy Mine"" shows to be an enjoyable interpretation of a classis sci-fi story. The worst I can say about this movie is the human space fighters are apalling in design and worse in set construction but they aren't the show.Overall this isn't academy award material but it is a great rainy Saturday afternoon movie."
4,This film has aged well - it's still watchable and fun!,"Many old sci-fi movies, such as 1971's Andromeda Strain, are embarrassingly ""dated"" and unwatchable now, but Enemy Mine is still entertaining (even though I do admit that I would trim about 10 minutes if I were the editor).I give 5 stars only to movies that I think everyone should see before they die, and Enemy Mine isn't in that league, but still I highly recommend it."
5,"Five stars? Well, maybe four and a half...?","It would be too easy to call this film predictable or sappy. Well it's not, dang it! You've just got to love these characters and story. What a great film!"
4,A must have for all hard core SCI-FI fans.,"This starts out as a good buddy movie.Two enemies crash land on a uninhabited planet, and become friends. I believe that the Drac character dies too soon and the pace slows down with his(?) child. The ending is also two conviniate and simple. But that is okay because of the wonderful makeup and set designs."
3,Necessary Sci-Fi Viewing,"This is an essential movie for all sci-fi fans. Of course it's got some of the cheesy 80's acting and dialogue, but those are the only bad things about this movie. The setting and special effects look really good. The makeup is also incredible, and the story itself is pretty original and has a good message. Although it's not really a family movie as in the ammount of violence that takes place several time, it isn't over the top or excessive. The DVD sadly only has a bunch of trailers and THREE still production photos. What the? This movie deserves a better DVD, Fox! See this movie!"
5,One of the all time greats,This is a great sci-fi movie. Even though it was made in 1985 it holds up well. If you haven't seen it you have missed a great movie.
4,A Lesson In Friendship.,"Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. star in this movie about two fighter pilots from two different races who are at war who crash on the same remote deserted planet and are forced to work together to survive. In the process, they grow from enemies; to co-workers; to friends; and finally to blood brothers. Louis Gossett, Jr. plays the alien and his performance is superb. Not many actors can pull off such a realistic portrayal under so much cosmetics and synthetics. Dennis Quaid is always a delight to watch and this movie is no exception. Some of the effects are rather tame, but this is not an effects driven movie. This is a movie driven by the story and it's a great and moving story to watch unfold. The best thing I can say about the film is that my father hates science fiction movies, but he saw this on cable, loved it, and recommended it to me."
5,"Real, honest classic!","This is at the top of my short list for Sci-Fi or any type to be truthful. It is very thought provoking. The acting and emotion from Dennis to be called first rate is a understatement. The alien roll is also superb. Very emotional and believable. They become their roles. Something that is missing these days of too much special effects, producers after a quick buck and actors who show up just for the paycheck. If the actors do not believe in their roll and become the roll, it's not a classic or anything else."
5,great,I seen this Movie when it first came out and its one of the few movies I dont mind watching again.
2,Lousy,"This film begins well,however it quickly goes downhill once Quaid and the alien have crashed on the planet.Once this happens you may as well switch it off!The effects in this picture are dire!Just look out for the ""meteor"" shower on the planet,more like rolled up bits of smoking paper!The acting is dire,the plot is dire and the soundtrack is dire!Save your money!If you want a good sci/fi fighter/action film,buy Star Wars or Babylon 5 instead!"
2,factory seconds/tastes great though!,"These suckers taste GREAT... but after opening the wrappers, the 'last inch' is nothing but a thin sheet of candy like it was a bubble with nothing on the inside but air. Also, some other suckers have had the top inch cut off accidentally. I could tell this company (which sold it to me), got them at a reduced price because we only get about 3/4 of a sucker and there are 24 suckers in each box.I love the taste of these suckers so in the past I've bought boxes from other companies and have never had this happen before. (as far as the product being under weight)"
2,Low Budget!,"This rendering of Shakespeare's play is neither a full-fledged movie nor a filmed theatrical performance. It is rather a quickly completed television production that reminds one of 1960's children's programs.With the notable exception of the Victorian costumes that do succeed in making the infamous yellow stockings stand out, there are few original or creative elements that stand out.A single tacky and unoriginal set is used throughout the play.Silly elements such as the Christmas tree or the underground cave that serves as a jail fall flat and are just not funny.Worse, some actors play for the camera whereas others project their voices as if they were on stage.Sadly, this DVD can only be recommended to die-hard Branagh fans passionately interested in his career's evolution."
1,Very poor quality DVD,"Like a plane video tape - no caption, no scene selection, no special feature, etc. Furthermore, poor color; sometimes simply frozen. Greatly disappointed."
5,Better Than Peyton Place,"I attended a presentation on Grace and her early years growing up in Manchester, NH. The lecturer mentioned other books that she had written and I was particularly interested in this one. It is excellent! Now, I plan to read her other books. This book is almost an autobiography of her life and female ancestors. Although fiction, like Peyton Place, it is historical fiction depicting true life events."
2,It's Not Better Than Peyton Place,"But in a way, it is similar. Beginning in Canada, and moving down to NH (if I remember correctly), the main characters each have their say. It begins with a husband, who to deal with a wife who won't sleep with him, becomes an alcoholic. He dies from this, thus leaving his beloved daughter to be raised by her cleanliness-obsessed mother. It's interesting the way she describes him: keeping a bottle under his bed, and throwing up every morning. Metalious died a year after this book was published, of cirrhosis of the liver.Almost everyone in the book is mean and out for number one. You think the final character has perhaps won out, but then her husband has to actually speak, and he's childish and disgusting."
5,Much More Than Counting,This book is an excellent source of information if you have preschool age children in your house or class. I am studing to be an early childhood education teacher and have used this book several times to get ideas for lesson plans.
4,nice puzzles,My 2.5 yr old loves these puzzles. When the puzzle is assembled each picture is small ... probably half the size of a standard sheet of paper. But that is fine....each puzzle has 12 pieces.The puzzle pieces are wood but seems very thin wood. I do not use the unfinished wood box to store the puzzle due to all the complaints against this puzzle's sister puzzle set (4 Wood Vehicle Puzzles in a Box also by Melissa & Doug). I place each puzzle in a zip lock bag and give my child one puzzle at a time.Since he is new to the puzzles I sit with him and help when he starts to get frustrated. He can do 2 of the 4 puzzles by himself and has only used them for about 2 weeks.The price is worth it.
4,not as bad,i don't usually like these types of books but just knowing about other people's stories kinda helped. :)
1,This Sounds Really Familiar,"Haven't I heard this stuff before? ""Conquering Your QLC"" is pretty much just a repackaging of ""The Quarterlife Crisis."" ""The QLC"" is a great book, but if you already have a copy, don't bother buying ""Conquering.""I think what is really needed is something that helps twentysomethings get to solutions - not something that points out the problems that were already the subject of another book.How can I get a refund for ""Conquering Your QLC?"""
1,A piece of fluff,"I just quit in the middle of Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis - I can't take any more psychobabel!If you are truly interested in survival, use your ten dollars to buy a month's supply of Ramen instead of Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis."
1,Not enough substance,"After reading other reviews of this book, I decided to check it out for myself. Either they read a different book than me or they didn't read it all.While Ms. Robbins' writing form is adequate this book provides very little insight. Some of the personal stories she re-tells are interesting reads but there is never any real connection given or application made to give assistance within one's own life.Flat-out, this book does not make you think.As a compilation of stories, I'd give it three stars but for it's claim to provide help with this stage of our lives, one star is the only fair designation."
3,OK not great,A little disappointed in the cd. I thought it was going to be hidden jems and instead they were just really lame with only a few exceptions.
4,Awesome,"I love this futon. Very easy to assemble. The only downside is the mattress - it is made of very heavy cotton, and it is not keeping the shape. I would suggest buying futon without mattress and look for better mattress.FYI. It is not poplar, it is tulip tree. I was freaking out at first seeing greenish wood and was worried if I managed to get futon made of pressure treated wood, then I google it and it turned out that for tulip tree it is normal to have greenish wood. In time color disappearing. I actually liked this greenish lines.Oh, I didn't use it as bed, so I cannot comment anyhow on this"
5,Great quality and beautiful!,"This futon is great! I love it... great quality, stronger than pine, sturdy and the price is awesome!"
5,A must-have one,"This is a ""must have"" book for everyone who deals with acoustic radiation. The treatment of nearfield acoustic holography was scattered all over the scientific literature about acoustics. Now one has a reference point, where all the main aspects of the subject are dealt with in a clear, didactic way. The chapters are very well organized, containing an introduction on the basic aspects of signal processing and leading naturally to a good understanding of the subject."
1,poor service,Installation instructions needed exreme magnificatyion to read. Necesary tool not included with part. Need for installation by a technician not revealed until half way through the process.
5,Besrt available Bruckner symphonies,"This album has been reviewed many times and by better critics than I. All I will add is that this is THE Bruckner set to get. Jochum is unexcelled with Bruckner. He caused a sensation when he debuted with these symphonies and it was well deserved. OK, you can get better sound since these are ADD CD's, but the sound is more than satisfactory and what good is great sound when the conductor doesn't understand the music and give it his all.There's a later set by the same conductor I understand, but the symphonies are clumsily broken up within the set, and Jochum was past his prime when they were recorded. So stick with this set."
2,I don't understand,Not a great recording...Sometimes the orchestra rushes in an uncontrolled tempo and the dynamics is painful. There's too many passages without any sensitivity. I've also had a hard time listening to instruments who do not balance out. For my part I've given up trying to make sense. Sure you can listen to it but at many points I get deeply disturbed. Sorry to say but this box goes to the litter box. I would recommend Carlo Maria Giulinis Bruckner recordings. That music rocks from an organic concept.
2,African American Rhtetoric,"Even for my college course, this was more of a research text for a graduate school course."
4,Steve Morse insites and performance,"This DVD is a combination of two previously released Steve Morse instructional Video Tapes. It's a faithful copy of the tapes and nothing more. If your a Steve Morse fan (and you SHOULD be) this is a great purchase. (if you are updating your old vcr tapes, this works also) Steve covers his rig and various techniques along with samples of some of his songs. Of course the highlights are the performances of some of the songs. compaired to the original price of the video cassettes, the price is a bargain. The DVD covers about two hours worth of material. Now if they would just release Steve Morse's ""Power Lines"" on DVD."
1,WHAT A SIN !,"What a sin ! You take one of the greatest surprises of action movies in the decade (""SPEED"") and then make a totally wasted sequel, the kind of sequel responsible for the bad name sequels have! IT's the same director (de Bont), the same beautiful actress (Bullock), but it never works. I feel sorry for Dafoe being in it, he's a great and respectable actor."
1,A top speed of two millimeters a second,"It was Randy in Scream 2 who quoted sequels as, ""by definition alone they are inferior films."" This film goes a long way to backing up that particular statement. Rather it ends the debate of sequels in a heart beat. And what is wrong with this movie? For starters, you have a ditsy heroine (Sandra Bullock from the original Speed) who drives a car much like she drove the bus in the first movie. A hero cop (Jason Patric) who takes about as much interest in what's going on around him as a dog on valuum. And let's not forget the obligatory bad guy (Willem Dafoe) who's bacground and overall purpose make about as much sense as a misspelt chinese manuel to a VCR. The overall story has no logic, no pace, and no direction. It's name is Speed 2: Cruise Control? A more appropriate name would've been, ""What Speed?: No Control."""
1,In this movie was created in 1960s it could be a classic,"The one star is for:1)You could watch a cruise ship mowing down beach condos.2)A not too bad oil-tanker-blow-up-scene.3)A song that wake ya up at the end of the cruise.I would like to take this star away-but unfortunate I cannot because:1)Every one in this movie are stupid including the bad guy-normally they are the smarter than cops,lol2)Cruise ship is a computerized toy ship.If this movie was shot in 1960s, it could be another ""Gozilla"", but......"
1,Horrible,"This is by far the worst sequel ever. An award winning movie (worst remake/sequel) deserves its award and more. Dennis Hopper is replaced by Willem Dafoe who does an awful job considering his incredible performances in other films like Platton and The Clearing. Sandra Bullock is still here but her original intensity in the first movie is replaced by screwball, moronic diologue and bad acting. And Keanu Reeves is replaced with Jason Patric (Did I get his name right?) who does a fake acting job (I'm not saying that Keanu is the best actor on the earth, but he did a much better job). And Jan de Bont screws up the perfect movie with a retarded sequel. Skip this one. I don't usually encourage the Nazi way of life, but go ahead and burn this one in a huge pile. Crap Crapity Crap.The PlotThey're on a boat and it's going to hit and island. That's about it."
1,This is proof that Keanu can think. Who knew?,"Watching this movie is like watching paint dry. Only, when it's done, the paint is dry and you still haven't seen a decent movie. Sandra Bullock should have known better. Keanu Reeves apparently did, as he jumped ship before this one sailed. Jason Patric takes over as love interest here. Willem Dafoe chews up any scenery that might be left after a painfully long, and pitifully staged ending sequence.If you enjoy torturing yourself, or like to make fun of movies as you watch them... this one is for you."
1,Speed 2: Snooze control,"Thankfully Keanu Reeves didn't show up for this awful snooze-fest sequel, leaving Sandra Bullock to try and salvage some dignity, and director Jan DeBont proves that Speed was a once-off. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that includes Batman and Robin."
1,Wake me up before you go go,"Guy, this is baaaaaaadd...I wonder how Bullock accepted this sequence(you will say: money. But there are other ways to getting it for a great actress like her, Director DeBont dropped the ball, and probably sepulted this ""series"" forever. Horrible."
1,Bah!,I can't believe I spent money to see this movie in the theater. That's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. My advice: Watch the first one!
1,Snooze Control,"Thankfully Keanu Reeves didn't show up for this awful snooze-fest sequel, leaving Sandra Bullock to try and salvage some dignity, and director Jan DeBont proves that Speed was a once-off. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that includes Dragonfly."
1,Speed 2 -Cruise Control,"Definitely avoidable. Sheer waste of time. The acting is very average and tze storytelling is very weak. Even Sandra Bullock has given an oridinary performance.If you want waste money, then rent it.United Arab"
1,Typical Hollywood: From big Blockbuster to bad sequel...,"This is typical Hollywood trying to create a movie with the same plot and different settings. This movie is mundane to so the least. Cheesy characters, poor script, big explosions, and ridiculous plot. Not that Keanu is some maverick actor, but he must have laughed at this script when they offered it to him, before turning them down. This film explains why after 5 years there is no Speed 3!!!"
3,Defiantly not as Good as the first,"it was alright, but i can't say it was better or as good as the first. i strongly recommend watching the first, then watching the second."
1,As bad as it sounds,"I think the producers of Speed 2cancelled any attempt to actually make the film after lead actor Keanu Reeves turned down another role, claiming how he disliked the script. That's basically enough said. But no, just change the script around and put in another actor(Jason Patric)as the hero.Speed 2 is simply stupid, or rather, in better terms, moronic and brain dead. It makes Jerry Bruckheimer productions looks thoughtful in comparison, Jason Patric is bland the whole way through, Willem Dafoe looks like a dog in this movie, and Sandra Bullock continues to show that she makes the worst film choices for a ""high profile"" actress."
3,"Much more enjoyable than the unending, overated ""Titanic""","In 1997, ""Speed 2"" got some of the worst reviews, and ""Titanic"" got some of the best. I would watch ""Speed 2"" over ""Titanic"" anytime. ""Titanic"" was not a bad movie, it was just plain and simply too long. ""Speed 2""'s action sequences, good script, and fast pace make this a good one. I can completely understand Willem Dafoe's anger over being fired. I was dedicated and commited to a job of mine and then I got fired for the most idiotic reason you could ever think of. Unfortunatly, I am no computer genius. But thats besides the point. I would say this movie is as good as the first, maybe even better. Don't listen to these people saying its no good. Completely untrue. This is not one of the best movies of all time, but ""Titanic"" isnt either. This should have won some awards, it was good and entertaining"
1,Very Unimpressed,"The original SPEED is my favorite movie. But SPPED 2 was a big let down. It ruined the name SPEED had built up for itself. They could have picked a much better place than a cruise ship for the movie to take place. Also, maybe they could have gotten bigger stars to do the movie. Don't get me wrong, Willem Dafoe is a fine actor. But Jason Patric? I had never heard of him before I saw this movie! And Sandra Bullock's turned into... a girl! Hopefully they will make a SPEED 3 to compensate for this disaster. Go back to the original story somehow, with the original charachters."
3,Without the beautiful scenery.....it's lousy.,"In Speed 2, a sequel of the original Speed, Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes you to a cruise for another speed adventure. The first half of the movie is trashy. Here she got romantically involved with Jason Patric, another LAPD officer. And what happened to Keanu Reeves, her boyfriend of the first movie? Something is real missing here. This sequel should connect her previous romance which will make it better. Anyway, the movie picks up interest when the speeding cruise ship approaches an oil tanker and to a cliff and to a populated harbor. Despite of the annoying ship, the movie takes some shots of the beautiful Caribbean hospitality, otherwise, the movie is all trashy."
2,Wide screen letterbox format sucks!,"Had some pretty good special affects, but the acting and the story was very stupid."
3,none,i liked this movie but i wish keanu was in this movie and also wish that dennis hoopers carecter in the first one had i twin brother who was at for revenge on the ship that would make this movie better.
5,Great sequel!,"I don't know why everyone says that this movie is complete crap. Sure, it isn't as good as the first Speed... but what is? You can't compare all the aspects of this film to the first one, when you know that they won't add up! Sandra Bullock reprises her role as Annie, and she is stunning this time around! Although Keanu Reeves was definetely better than Jason Patric, Bullock is definetely better this time around, as she is given much more to do... and boy does she know what to do with it!All in all, if you're looking for an action film with a very simple plot yet lots of explosions and action, then Speed 2 is great, despite the fact that it isn't as good as the first. It also has some really great acting!"
3,"speed 2 okay, but the first is better","i enjoyed watching this movie even though the first speed is better. even though i dont think that a movie like speed needed a sequel, i thought this movie was okay. its good to see that sandra bullock is in this sequal and other characters from the original speed.i think it would have been better if speed didnt have a sequal because original movies such as speed do not need one, but this sequal, as i said, was okay."
3,Sequel does little harm...,"Director Jan De Bont brings to the screen another hijacking adventure, this time on a boat. While plenty of the suspense from the first film is missing and the comic relief gets a little too wasteful, ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" keeps a pretty good pace without doing much harm to the viewer. Jason Patric plays our hero here, and does a commendable job. Sandra Bullock doesn't get too annoying, and Willem Dafoe plays the bad guy pretty much like anyone else would have. Overall, an easy flick to watch, but not a groundbreaking action spectacular."
2,Stick with the first 'Speed'!,"This is not a good movie. It has bad editing, horrible script, bad action-sequences, dumb-villian, hammy acting, except for Sandra Bullock who's playing herself in a surprisingly annoying way. Nothing seems to be right here. The only thing worth-wile is the final resort-crushing sequence. Rent it first. If you like Sandra Bullock I recommend 'Speed', if you like Jason Patric I recommend 'After Dark My Swet, and if you like Willem Dafoe I recommend 'Platoon' or 'The English Patient'. From a scale of 1-10 I give it a 3."
2,"Speed 2 is lame, but entertaining","Okay, let's review: Speed was great! If you read my review on that I gave in and gave it five stars. This is lame. But, it also entertained me. Let me explain: Here I am in a hot movie theater and Speed 2 begins so stupidly. I knew it wouldn't get any better, so I tried to enjoy it. Every aspect of the movie was very, very badly done. But it was never boring. I believe that if Bollock was out and they went with original characters this movie could have been higher graded. Why? Bollock's character was great in Speed. What happened? When did she decide to jump on the annoying truck. ""Oh man"", ""This can't be good"" blah, blah lines were bad. But entertaining."
1,WOW,I am speechless. I am without speech. One of the worst movies in the world. Every frame of this movie sucks. It is unbelievably DUMB.
1,"Bad, worse, Speed 2","This movie is lame and insuling to your intellgence. The acting is poor, the plot is predictable and as for dialogue...well now that I think of it, there isn't any (except for old chliches and dumb jokes)."
2,Ugh!,"Why was this film even made? Take my word for it, THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SEQUELS EVER TO OF BEEN CREATED. While the original ""Speed"" was an action masterpiece, this sequel is dry and boring, with a weak and artificial looking climax. The script and plot is cheesy, and DaFoe was perhaps the only acting high-point in the entire film. Just one word: UGH!"
1,"Bigger, but certainly not better","The only thing that's watchable here is . . . . wait, let me rephrase that. There is absolutely NOTHING watchable here. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are thin and annoying (especially Dafoe, who is in fact a great actor elsewhere), the action sequences are nothing but silly and painful to watch, and the script is . . . well, the script isn't as bad as the one for Batman & Robin, but it's STILL bad. What made Jan de Bont think he could try to surpass the classic original? Well, whatever happened, this movie turned out to be very worthless. Pass."
2,no,"Everyone, including myself, thought Keanu Reeves was a total moron for turning down this film. Then it was released, and a total flop, and badly received in every way. So Keanu Reeves turned out to be a lot smarter than he looks!! It seemed Jason Patric had won the lottery when he got this role. But it seemed to bury his career. His girl friend Christie Turlington and he broke up, and she ended up marrying another actor with a hotter career. I'd bet almost anything Turlington and he would have gotten married if this movie had been a hit and made him a big star."
3,yayaya isssy poo,meesa thinx es Sandra Bullock should have namen Silly Bollucks. She super pretten but inno es acten like good sal. Es super good for you!
1,Blah!,I can't believe I spent money to see this movie in the theater. That's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. My advice: Watch the first one!
1,Deserves the golden turkey award,"This movie is lame and insulting to your intellgence. The acting is poor, the plot is predictable and as for dialouge...well now that I think of it, there isn't any(except for old cliches and dumb jokes). ."
1,"descusting, it's dumb compaired to Speed",The replacement of Reeves made me mad. Sandra Bullock did nothing that she did in Speed 1. The first one was way better no question about that. I think whoever thaught that was good and thaught it deserved anything more than one star should compair it to the first one.
1,"Oh The Horror, THE HORROR!","What more can be said than awful. Ok, How about hideous, disgusting, vile, trite, pathetic, and utterly contrived. The first SPEED was bad enough, was there really a need for a sequel, and on a cruise ship, give me a freaking break. Even Keanu wouldn't star in this nightmare movie from hell, that's how truly awful it was.I almost wish I could sue the film company for the hour or so I wasted by watching it when it came on cable. It was like a car accident, no matter how hard I tried I couldn't look away. I practically needed a ""Silkwood"" shower after viewing it, and my cat is still have nightmares about it, he screams in his sleep now. I wish only there was a way to erase these things from my permanent memory, and movie history in general."
1,Reeves was smart !,"KEanu Reeves must have a realy good agent ! Instead of accepting to make this cheap sequel to the action classic ""SPEED"", he chose to shoot great movies like ""THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE"" and ""MATRIX"". The screnplay ( if we can call it by that name) is so bad it made me laugh."
1,"Leave any and all sense in your car, at home, etc..","One of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It ranks right up there with fight and dead-defying scenes on SOAP OPERAS!! A huge cruise ship plowing thru the harbor taking EVERYONE by surprise (obviously the weekend of DEAF boaters), as it smashed into small boats for the sake of...well, smashing into small boats..... Sandra Bullock has her hands tied and is underwater and her ""guy"" still has time to give her a kiss while under there. How sweet! (OR he may be trying to give breathe to her & the plot...who knows?) It would not have been surprising to see William Defoe twirl a big handle-bar moustache and give an evil laugh in his scenes. I hated giving it even ONE star. But I guess the cruise ship side-swiping the oil tanker was worth that much. In short? Busy camp with the typical ""beard"" for the male character."
2,"Bad sequel, awful waste of time, bad acting","""Speed 2"" seemingly has absolutely nothing to do with the first, superior ""Speed,"" by having only Sandra Bullock and her new LAPD/SWAT boyfriend (not Keanu Reeves) go on a cruise ship and have it technically hijacked by sick madman Willem Dafoe, in one of his worst roles EVER.Futhermore, Jan De Bont further ruins the movie by adding unnecessary details like the large cruise ship, eccentric passengers, desperate crew, and by making it louder than necessary, while ""Speed"" has a simple plot and a electrically charged screenplay to work with.In other words, the movie is loud, totally unnecessary, acting is loud and overstated, and is totally bad. The only reason I give it two stars is because Bullock manages through this turgid mess with a straight face and her hilarious lines make this a bearable action ""thriller.""Rated PG-13 for violence and profanity."
1,Shipboard drivel,"Why, oh why weren't Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on this ship? It would have struck that tanker near the end, gone down and mercifully spared us from ""Speed 2"" and its gosh-awful acting, plot and execution. Sandra Bullock, who specializes as America's favorite girl-next-door actress, reprises her role as an unwitting hostage, this time aboard a cruise ship hijacked by Willem Dafoe (whose talent is wasted here). Jason Patric delivers his usual one-note performance, and the action is pallid and predictable. This film made ""The Love Boat"" series look like high seas adventure. At least that show had characters you were supposed to laugh at."
2,not so speedy,"Really, the reason Speed 2: Cruise Control isn't a classic like the first one is because the speed storyline is not a bus, but a BOAT this time around. Do you really think a boat can go as fast as a bus? Even if a boat is fast, do you think that's more exciting than a bus avoiding danger in the city streets? I don't. What kind of amazing dangers can a boat avoid? OTHER boats? Ocean buoys?A bus with a bomb underneath it is more rewarding to watch. Speed 2 feels more like a way to cash in on the original. I watched the movie twice and wasn't satisfied either time. It's an okay movie, though. But don't expect ""speed""."
1,What a turkey !.,"This movie is so awful, it's almost not worth reviewing. The last half of the movie is lit in a flickering irritating red light, which makes it completely unwatchable. No doubt was this movie intended for teens only. But the bad guy here is really MTV, having done more damage to the movie-industry than anyone or anything else."
5,Super!,"Although this movie takes a little while to get moving, once it sets off, there's no turning back! This movie is hard to keep your eyes off of, mainly due to the air-tight action scenes and splendid acting, mainly due to Sandra Bullock and William DaFue (Jason Patric isn't horrible, he just isn't as good as Keanu Reeves).This movie is filled with some really cool scenes, such as the scene where Jason has to save the deaf girl from the flooding and when the ship is crashing through the town! Sandra Bullock made me laugh out loud many times throughout the film, and in my opinion, is much better this time around!Although it doesn't live up to Speed 1, Speed 2 is a definite must to add to your DVD collection, for you action lovers out there! When it comes to an action movie, we care more about explosions than we do about the storyline, and Speed 2 accomplishes this amazingly well!"
1,What a waste of time and money,This was probably the stupidest Sandra Bullock movie ever made...not that her movies aren't stupid enough already. And you wonder why Keanu Reeves wouldn't do this movie.
3,"Fun, but very dumb","The first Speed was a whole lot better. But this one is fun too, cause its so stupid that is just another a dumb movie. I do kind of wonder what happend to Jack. The deaf girl was the best character. The ending was kind of stupid. Its a fun movie to see once or twice, but probably not more than that."
4,beautiful balance,"This is a great performance of a lovely group of pieces. I find the balance and interplay between the piano and violin some of the best I have ever heard. We all know Perlman to be the great artist he is, but Samuel Sanders one of the best, most thoughtful accompanists I have ever heard. The Vol. 2 is even better and gets 5 stars."
4,A Review,I ordered this scraper as a Christmas present for my brother-in-law. It came here promptly after I ordered. Since it is a gift I can't really review the product.
3,Tragic flaw,This phone/answering machine is great but for one feature which renders it inappropriate for office use: the outgoing message greeting can not be fully silenced. You are forced to listen to your message with each incoming call!
1,Dead on Arrival,"This is the second time I've had a Uniden phone. The first one lasted just a few months. I should have known better; this one was dead on arrival. After charging for 24 hours, the handset worked, but the speaker never worked. Given the nuisance of returning defective consumer electronics, I'll stick with Panasonic in the future."
1,I really want to like it...,"Cook for the Cure! What could be better? Well, a Silpat, really. I really want to like this mat but it buckles and distorts while baking, and baked goods stick to the surface. As a craft mat, my daughter likes it fine.My thought is, instead of buying this, support Cancer research directly and buy good quality silicone baking sheets that you will love for years."
1,worst baking mat I own,"I have several silicone mats that I use for baking cookies. This is by far the worst. It bubbles and buckles making the cookies bake unevenly. I imagine that it would work fine as a craft mat - thank you to the reviewer who suggested that - but for a baking mat, go another route."
4,Stuck no more,"If you haven't discovered silicon baking mats, you are still working too hard to clean up from baking.We've become addicted, since these work better than a non-stick cookie sheet for cookies like ""turtles"" which leak caramel.This product is a set of 2 small mats. I used one as a stocking stuffer for my sister, and we kept one. They are small enough to be used in some toaster ovens. We have multiple baking mats and we don't know how we did so long without."
2,I have no use for these.,"It's such a great idea, right? Don't have to really worry about getting the pan all stained and dirty, and the food won't stick! But, I've found that there's a limited amount of things I can use the silicone baking mats for. Anything I use them with comes out soft and chewy, which is nice for some things, but I usually like the cookies I bake to have just a little bit of crispiness around the edges. I used these once, and they've been in my pantry ever since."
4,Does the job,"It's not a Silpat but it does the job. I got one set for my 2nd oven which is tiny. I used this to bake cookies and they work just fine, the clean up is easy. They were a steal for $9.99 for the set of 2, but for more serious baking I'd probably get another Silpat as this is not very thick."
1,Avoid this TERRIBLE product at all costs! Just Terrible!,"I can't remember the last time I came across such a miserable, worthless product--this is a real STINKER! I can't imagine what it's good for, other than wasting our money and making money for some large corporation that parents KitchenAid!You certainly can't bake with these mats'o hell--everything sticks (even with non-stick spray which makes the cookies taste awful), and you have destroyed cookies that crumble as you are tearing thier stuck butts off of the mat! UGG! And the kitchen reeks of a terrible heated plastic smell which settles on the cookie a little--even my dog smelled the offered cookie twice, and he never does this!YECH!Parchment paper is more expensive in the long run--but SO much easier and functional, and well perfect. I will never veer away from parchment paper again!AVOID THIS ONE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!"
5,BYE BYE IPOD,"This unit is awesome. I was a hard core ipod user but now.... forget about it. Not only does this unit outperform the ipod on every level from sound level and equalization to size and functionality but it has an FM radio to boot. I can listen to my music the way I want to. This thing is a dream for anyone who exercises to music or comutes. I've had it for a couple of months now and am very happy with it. I use it every day, working out, playing basketball whatever. As a matter of fact a couple of my friends who bought ipod shuffles ebayed them as soon as they saw my U2 and got the U2 instead. Simply stated it's a lot more bang for less bucks. I want to say I've never written a review for anything... thats how impressed I am by this unit. Look out Ipod!"
2,Not sure at this point...,Received the iAudio U2 2 GB MP3 Player with FM Tuner (Black)promtly and was excited to use it but there is some issue withplaying different music formats. It is currently ONLY playing mp3format even though it says it plays all formats. I tried reformattingmy music through I-Tunes but nothing has changed. Does it have to dowith installation of their software on my mac? Or something else?
5,Great Item!,"I've had the iAudio U2 for about a year now and it's just fantastic. Works perfectly and have only had 1 instance where it froze (all I did was turn it off and turn it back on again). Also I love how lightweight it is (perfect for my running/walking and commute). The sound quality is amazing and the battery life is great. I only have to charge it maybe once a week, if that so it lasts a long time. Just a great product, highly recommend it."
1,Five stars until it DIED.,"This was my first flash-based MP3 player, which I bought specifically for listening to while running. I carried the player in its manufacturer-supplied ""holster"" zip-tied to a reflective waist belt, often in a zip-loc bag. After about 15 months of use, 2-4 times each week for 30-40 minutes each time, it simply died. Blank LCD screen. Reset button does nothing. My PC doesn't even detect it anymore. Now, with the U2 conveniently (for COWON) out of warranty, I'm forced to shop for another player. My impression of this device based on the manufacturer's website and reviews of similar players is that they are designed to be disposable. I don't see myself ever spending over $50.00 for another MP3 player. If *you* do, the 2 year replacement plan would be of benefit."
4,A good story of the Jedi attempting espionage,"This book was an enjoyable read that dealt with Quinlan Vos against Count Dooku and Aayla Secura against Aurra Sing. It doesn't add much to the overall Star Wars story like Volume 5 does, but it is worth reading."
1,Millers Awash,"I had read so much about Millers Crossing and had never seen it. So sat down and watched in anticipation. What a bunch of garbage. I read all these 5 star reviews and really can not see what these people saw. Acting average at best, script pathetically inept and well it basically goes absolutely nowhere. I was left thinking that it is two hours of my life that I will never get back.It is a film I will never watch again. One reviewer said every time he watches it (brave multiple viewer), he cannot find a flaw in the film...Wow really? Horrible."
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,This was not as good as what i was thinking it would be very boring i felt like it did not have a good story line
4,Didn't like the characters but I liked the movie,"One must judge movies by the quality of the piece ...I hated almost every character here, but that dislike made the movie what it is.Tom is the muscle man for two small time huslers in this depression era ganster movie who pits two warring gangster against each other in order to make peace.Tom inadvertently becomes what he hates most...maybe without knowing it...at least that's what I think.I said Tom is the muscle man but his muscle is his brain and in the end he's still a guy good at heart.Worth a recommend."
4,Dialogue too flowery,"Yeah, I liked it a lot. But I couldn't help noticing the blatant flaws of this film. Everyone lives or works in HUGE spaces. I doubt it. The apratments would be smaller and the office used by Finney was too fancy. The dialogue was too perfect. Everyone was like, reading from a poetry book. What was with Byrne's accent? It would be really Irish and then really Noo Yawk. Also, the reactions by the characters were at times too calm. Too suave. But hey-its a lot of fun. Turturo steals the show."
3,Interesting story with a dud ending,"The single most important thing to me about a movie, or any other form of entertainment, is that it holds my interest. This one did, most of the time, with a few exceptions.Another thing I'm looking for in a movie is that it has a satisfying ending. This one doesn't, which is a shame. It leaves you feeling blah.That being said, it seems like a well made movie, worth a look. Don't expect anything that will lift your spirits. The ending is really pretty pointless, just a dud."
3,eh eh,"Gabriel Byrne had this really strong Irish accent, but it would come and go every few minutes. He would go from that to a regular American speaking voice. Weird.The movie had it's moments, but, it was pretty boring, all in all."
5,GREAT COEN BROS FLICK,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOBSTER FILMS EVER MADE.GABRIEL BYRNE IS RUTHLESS.GOTTA LOVE THE COEN BROS
5,Gangster noir.,"Dark and powerful story of Irish gansters. It's interesting to see a gangster film that centers around an ethnic group other than Sicilians. It's fresh and fascinating. The underrated Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden turn in stellar, complex performances and John Turturro has a chilling moment when he reveals how much of his supposed weakness is really manipulation. With this piece, the Coens add another chapter to their stark look at America. From Fargo to Miller's Crossing to Arizona, the Coens have revealed our sordid secrets through bleak, realistic storytelling and innovative direction. They know us."
3,"Nice movie, great cast, decent plot and dialogue...not genius","This is a nice enough movie. Byrne is well cast and Finney is splendid as always and that guy who played the hotheaded Italian stole all his scenes; excellent. However, you're never convinced the Coens had a handle on how bosses really operated. Furthermore, the events, break-ins, and crack downs seem contrived and orchestrated rather than actual. The plot keeps you thinking, but there is too much vagueness, and the anti-hero survives by dumbluck or the incompetence of his dupes, rather than by real cleverness. Too much of the love interest triangle is bland and feels phony as well. Overall, the movie feels more cartoonish than cutting edge, a like too much Dick Tracy. Just an average flick I'd say."
5,Full of Surprises,"This is not just another mafia movie. It is interesting and full of surprise twists throughout the movie. The main character is a gutsy loner type. The music in the movie is quite good. There are several interesting characters in the movie and I like it because it shows strategy and development of character, not just shooting like other movies of this type sometimes do. This movie will excite you, amuse you and is one I highly recommend to watch over and over."
1,Maybe it's about another movie?,"Guys, what do you like about this movie? I've seenGabriel Byrne's incredible perfomance in ""The usualsuspects"" and immediatly bought ""M.C.""What can I say? Gabriel Byrne is great, but the movie isso boring... Nothing to compare with, for example,""Once upon time in America"" (that's masterpiece!).BTW, it's the first time when I put a grade less than 4 stars."
2,Boring,"I love the Coen Brothers. I hated this movie. This movie was so boring I found myself fast-forwarding through most of it. It lacks the visual stimulation that all the other Coen movies have. I'm just glad it didn't become a habit. One black sheep is alright...but we'll have no more of that, you hear?"
3,"Quite unique, but a muddled mess","I could not understand about half the wordy script here, though the outline of the plot becomes more or less clear after awhile. This is probably one of those films that benefits from multiple viewings, but who has time for that? I still have no idea exactly what the role of John Turturro was supposed to be. In one of the extras, someone says they thought this was a comedy when they first read it, and I can see why. Both the rival crime bosses are almost cartoonish in their anger. The look of certain scenes veers towards the exaggerated look of a cartoon at times, too. In fairness, I did get through this in one sitting, which is rare. I wouldn't call it the best gangster flick ever made, as some say. It is far from that. It is very hard to understand. Still, you will want to see if you agree or if you join the majority who think this was some kind of brilliant inspiration. Not me."
2,Not good,"One of the top rated reviews states that this is the smart mans version of Casino or the Godfather. I don't think so.... First the worst part is the soundtrack. It's a laughable Disney soundtrack. Second, the characters are also Disney-like in that they are so freaking cliche. Lastly, it doesn't have a smart twist at the end. I loved ""No Country for Old Men"" but for this to be a Cohen brothers movie... I feel embarrassed for them. Not worth the 2.99 rental."
4,"INTERESTING GANGSTER ENTRY, BUT IT'S NO GODFATHER!","I have been wanting to see this film ever since I read my evil twin's review on this film. I'm always game for a great gangster movie and for the most part 'Miller's Crossing' delivers. The film starts a bit slow and the characters seemed to be a little stereotypical for my taste, but by the second half the film comes together for a worthwhile finale!This film is like a cross between 'The Cotton Club' and 'The Sting'! It's really quite different as far as gangster films go and this might have caused me to feel the film was a slow starter. If you've passed this one by, you might want to give it a shot! It's a worthy entry in the great gangster film club. The DVD transfer is very good."
5,The best movie of all time...,"There isn't really any other movie that's captured me as much as Joel and Ethan Coen's Miller's Crossing. This movie has it all -- an excellent script, great actors, love, romance, and struggle. I've seen this movie at least 7 times - I limit myself to one time a year so that I don't get tired of it and become insensitive to the its poetry. No other scene has moved me as much as the one in which Bernie -- played by the great John Turturro -- begs for his life at Miller's Crossing. And Tom -- played by Gabriel Byrne -- shows on his face the surfacing of his heart, maybe for the first time in his life.A tribute to film noir, this dense film about the workings of the human heart is to my mind one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever."
5,One of the best Gangster films in the year of 1990,"Putting the rightfully-so classicGoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)and the much maligned, but maginificent and misunderstoodThe Godfather, Part III (Widescreen Edition)aside, this is the definitive gangster film of 1990 and possibly the 90's all together.Miller's Crossing tells the tale of a mob boss, Leo, his partner, and the many, many, many things that trouble them. Albert Finney is Leo and Gabriel Byrne is Tom, his right hand man and best friend. Marcia Gay Harden plays the woman that conflicts there lives.It's quite an interesting and wonderful tale featuring wonderful performances from John Turturro, Jon Polito and quite a few others.The movie itself is great, the DVD leaves something to be desired. An interview, short interview with Barry Sonnefield, the Barry Sonnefield Featurette as well as short cast interviews with Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden and John Turturro.Highly recommended."
5,Still the Coen's best film.,"I'm going to keep this short. This remains the Coen's best film. Dialogue, storyline, direction and acting do not get much better than this. Now, why isn't it out on DVD with a whole bunch of extras??"
4,the last reviewer is right. Everything that this person hates about the movie I loved,"The gangsters in this movie are not supposed to sound or be acting authentic. The characters are supposed to be fun and the voices were just awesome. This is my favorite role from Gabriel Byrne. The way he has no cares about anybody but himself was very interesting to watch. There are a few plots here going on that all come together for a rather unspectacular ending, but this was still a great movie.So we have superb acting performances by some of the greatest actors ever. Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, John Turturro, Steve Buschemi....I didn't think it was one of Marcia Gay Harden's best performances, but still a very solid job. Now the reason that this movie will always be remembered by me is J.E Freeman. His acting job playing ""The Dane"" was the performance of the century.The cast interviews are pretty good. Movie is widescreened and sound is not 5.1 but still pretty good."
2,What a dissapointment,"I bought this DVD based on the recommendations in Amazon and the actors - I typically enjoy Gabriel Byrne films (Defence of the Realm is superb) and Albert Finney is a favourite.I watched the film and fell asleep (admittedly I was tired). The next evening I took another look. What a dissapointment. Quite simply this film didn't do it. Byrne was totally emotionless - took some severe beatings without so much a showing a scratch. Predictable film. Just lacking. Period.One to rent from Blockbuster, not to buy."
2,Was it the actor?,"I was annoyed by the lack consistency in the main character's accent. It was terrible. Why have someone who cannot keep a consistent accent, have an accent in your movie?"
1,I was bored !,"I was expected a great movie because I usually like the Coen brothers but Miller's Crossing was just boring. Too much useless dialogues for not many action scenes.Not many outdoor scenes neither. Actors were okay but the story is simply not interesting enough.On the other hand, I liked the special features."
1,"Overrated, Extremely Predictable, Worst Coen Bros. Movie","Reading the reviews for this movie, I came in with high hopes - which always makes it tougher in regards to being critical of a movie. However, Miller's Crossing did not even come close to meeting my expectations. I am a fan of Coen Bros. movies in general, especially O' Brother Where Art Thou, but this one left me very disappointed. The plot was extremely predictable and the dialogue was about as cliche as you can get. Very poor character development (the main character started out with an accent, but didn't stick with it?), and very little to keep me interested. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. To compare this movie with great movies like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, or Godfather is absolutely ridiculous. If you want to watch an enjoyable, well written mobster movie try Goodfellas, Scarface or the Untouchables, but completely avoid Miller's Crossing."
1,"A Major ""Turkey""..","Don't waste your money on this one; probably the most ridiculous period film I've ever seen. The hero goes through the film absorbing beating after incredible beating(including an impossible number of blows accompanied by hurtling down multiple flights of stairs) but emerges virtually unscathed(save for a split lip) every time. The Italian mobster character is woefully over-played...and on, and on. How anyone could even mention this sorry film in the same review with ""Road to Perdition"" escapes me. Definitely pass on this one...I'm going to sell my copy."
5,Beautiful background!,"I love the color and weight of this roll of seamless charcoal gray paper. It is easy to achieve the Dan Winters' portrait look with it, makes subjects stand out in an elegant way and is easy to use and a great weight of paper, not easy to rip at all, which is a plus! Thank you for offering such a quality product."
3,Older Kids ONLY!!!!,"Bought this for my four year old, thought it'd be a mild introduction to the whole Easter concept. Well, it's been weeks and he still has nightmares about the bad people killing Jesus (and himself, of course) on the cross. They show way too much for the little ones.The whole idea behind this series is good, and this video would be fine for a much older child (they would probably follow the dual storylines much better anyway), but please don't subject your little ones to this one - unless you want to explain to the Sunday School teacher why he/she keeps crying and telling everyone that Jesus died. :("
4,He's three and he loves it!,"My son is three years old and has been asking almost every day since Easter for ""the Jesus on the cross"" movie. He loves it. It has replaced Peter Pan (which he received for Christmas) as his favorite movie. My daughter who is 5 enjoys it as well."
5,Thanks!,"My order came in later than expected due to a misunderstanding with the post office, but the seller was super helpful and informative"
3,"Good, but tends to be a little repetitious","I understand the premise of the show, and initially, each episode is extremely interesting and entertaining. But I believe that you can only go so far with the same thing over and over again. Love the guys and their work, but this show ends up being a little too repetitive where you can predict what they will show next. Great episodes include the ones talking to the dead, recycling, and PETA. Interesting enough for one viewing per episode, but probably not worth a purchase."
3,okay,"The product appeared as advertised. However, it was very fragile and broke twice with minor drops. It did superglue back together well, however."
3,"Alexander, who used to be rich last Sunday","Alexander,who used to be rich last Sunday is a funny book.It's a little longer then most books.It's for children between ages 6-10 years old.The book is about a boy who has money one week.He gets it from his grandparents and parents. Then goes off one day and buys bubblegum.On the way home he makes a bet.He ends up losing an loses more money.He spends his money on garage sales.But still needs more money.It shows it's better to save your money for something your really want.Then to just spend it on little small things your don't need.But just feeling like buying."
2,"Okay, but buy a tube of super glue with it.","This watch is really cool because it is not something that I have seen in the stores, however, the character sliders are not tight enough to clip to the watch cover. They will slide on and just keep falling off. I just asked my son what his favorite one was and super glued it to the top so that he could use it. Looks and works great now. Not sure what I am going to do once he wants to change the character to the McQueen or Ramone sliders."
2,Shoot Me Now (Let Sarah Do It...I Luuuuv Her),"Yes, yes... I am a big Sarah fan and own at least 90% of her albums. This one, however, is probably the most useless of all of them. There are only two good songs on here:1) ""Time to Say Goodbye"": Sarah shines in her duet with Andrea Bocelli. Both deliver powerful performances.2) ""O Mio Babbino Caro"": Sarah is outstanding in this old classic. Though you can hear some strange noises in the background, her performance is much better than the one used in Classics."
4,Now that's what I call music from the heart!,"The first Sarah Brightman album I ever purchased prompted me to buy several more. Out ofthe eight Sarah albums I own,this one still rocks. Even La Luna never withstood the power of this s**t. And that's because Andrea Bocelli makes it worth listening to. 'Nuff said."
5,Beautiful Selections; Beautiful Voice,"I loved Sarah Brightman in Phantom of the Opera. I loved her on this cd as well. The duets with Andrea Bocelli and Jose Cura were especially well done. I liked the mix of modern compositions with more classical works. Though, I have to admit la Wally is my least favorite of the tracks. Ms. Brightman wrings the emotion out of every note on the other pieces and really invites you into the music. A powerful performance."
2,Boring!,"Although I am a fan of Sarah's and of classical music in general, I was very disappointed with this CD. She sounds lovely, but it's boring! There are a few nice tracks, but for the most part it just doesn't hold my attention. The modern songs on the CD also aren't very good! She should stick to the dramatic songs, it's what she's best suited for."
3,"Say Goodbye to Opera, Sarah!","OK, folks. I really, really DO like this album, which I initially bought to get the two duets with Jose Cura, who really, really IS an opera singer: a fabulous one whom I've seen perform many times. And I know a number of people who've been turned on to opera by this album, so I almost hesitate to write this. But it makes me cringe to read reviews extolling Brightman's ""operatic"" voice. She could not be heard beyond the orchestra pit of the smallest opera house. Sarah Brightman has a quite lovely, very small voice. I do not believe it fit for opera either in natural quality or technique and find her utterly out of her element in opera, though she occasionally manages to not altogether massacre the music. Please, love this album for what it is: an entertaining, eclectic collection of song, but don't hold her performances of those that come from operas as representative of the genre."
5,I like her pure girlish voice,"I know Brightman's bel canto technique is not as good as Maria Callas, but that imperfect quality adds an untrained, pure, youthfulness to her music. Even though she's in her fifties, her voice stills sounds like a cheerful young woman. I love that song ""No one like you"". It sounds like a young lady just fallen in her first love."
1,A pop singer with high aspirations,"Firstly I would like to say that I am not a purist. I enjoy good classical crossover artists. The key word here being ""good"".Ms. Brightman sings every single song with an incredibly thin, almost unemotional voice. There is no warmth in her voice that invites and welcomes you into her world, her interpertations of the songs. Rather, you are left sitting out in the cold wondering how she got signed in the first place.This CD was not, nor for that matter is any of Ms. Brightman's singing, a satisfying experience, and I suggest that if you are considering her music that you listen to a fair amount of it before purchasing to make sure that you will be able to stand her piccolo pipes often enough to warrant buying it."
2,"This is ""Entertainment"" not ""Music""","The only reason to give 2 stars to this CD is the track 1, and Andrea Bocceli. Yeah, I just love that song... Unfortunatelly, Sarah does have nice voice, but it is not even CLOSE to what ""real classical voice"" is about. Just listen to track 1, and wonder how Andrea manages to dominate with almost no effort, while Sarah is screaming around trying to be 'heard'. She simply doesn't have the 'power'. And singer that needs reverb... that's not a singer. People, listen to some REAL classical music before saying how this CD is ""great"". Especially ""Who Wants To Live Forever"" is pathetic. I still prefer the 'original' version. This all reminds me of Clayderman and people saying how great he is - jesus, it is entertainment, not the MUSIC. Shortly: it is more interesing to listen to orchestra than her voice. Sorry Sarah :)"
1,SARA BRIGHTMAN JUST DOES NOT HAVE IT!,"There are two words which sum up Sara Brightman: weak and bland. She is such an opera-singer wannabe but does not have the voice. She completely lacks volume and power (the orchestra drowns her out), and might I add--any sense of dramatic ability whatsoever. So why does she even attempt such operatic masterpieces as ""La Wally,"" and ""O mio babbino caro""? These pieces only expose her vocal shortcomings. Brightman also shows us in Mozart's ""Alleluja"" that extesive coloratura still does not make up for lack of voice. It is so odvious that the only reason she is famous in the first place is because she was married to Andrew Lloyd Webber. But even he could not open the door to the opera world for her with her average ability. The world is full of many artists who can sing circles around this bore.To hear geniune, gorgeous operatic voices refer to Ruth Ann Swenson, Angela Gheorghiu, and Renee Fleming and many others. Now they have talent."
1,Pop music lovers STAY AWAY!,"I have one word for you OPERA, OPERA, OPERA! She consistantly sounds far away like someone trapped in a bottle in the bathroom down the hall. Opera afficionados don't like this album because it's too POP, but let me tell you, if you like POP and hate most all Opera, like me, this IS Opera with a capital O. I discovered Sarah Brightman when I heard songs from her DIVE album played on Canadian airwaves. If you like POP or New Age like Enya, DIVE is the best Sarah Brightman album I've heard."
1,Not an opera singer,"Sarah Brightman seems to be a matter of preference. Truly talented, trained singers quabble over Brightman's voice and technique.Personally, I think she's okay. I hated her on the OCR of the Phantom of the Opera, but she has a pretty (if forgettable) voice on other songs she's sung.What bothers me most about this CD is that whether or not Brightman has a pretty or ""good"" voice, she is definitely NOT an opera singer. She is attempting to tackle songs that are totally not fit for her voice, thus making her sound weak, thin, and breathy. Her La Wally was pretty horrible."
2,Hmmm... I Don't Get It,"I enjoy Sarah just as much as anyone else, but I don't get why this album is considered her BIG album. All the songs on here are EXTREMELY slow-paced, and the only one noteworthy is the live bonus track performance of ""O Mio Babbino Caro"", but you can get that with ""Classics."" ""Harem"", ""La Luna"", ""Dive"", and ""Eden"" were MUCH better."
5,***Breathtakingly Beautiful***,This is such a beautiful CD. There are no words to describe how lovely it is. Sarah Brightman is a perfect singer. The duets Sarah performs with Andrea Bocelli and also newcomer Jose Cura - will take your breath away. We love it!
1,"Oh, there are so many better things out there...","I think Sarah Brightman is great for opening the eyes of people who don't like classical vocal music, but after you hear anyone else, you think... Wow, that was sooooo much better than Sarah Brightman. She has a very limited voice. Her registers are uneven and she seems unable to bring out expression in music. Why she chose to sing Alleluia is beyond me, because that song really, really shows her weaknesses. And she is not a coloratura!! For all those Sarah Brightman admirers, I beg you to try somebody that's really talented, such as Maria Callas or any of the artists other disenchanted reviewers mentioned. I guarantee you will find that they are ever so much better, and for future reviewers of this cd, just listen to something else before you say that Sarah Brightman is the angel of music."
5,"Superb,Fantastic, Refreshing Excellent!!!!",I have read those discouraging reviews of Sarah Brightman's songs.She doesnt seem to have a small voice at all.This CD collection is a must for true fans of Miss Brightman.Keep coming with more songs !!!!!! Show them who has the small voice now!!!!
3,Nice balance between pop sensibility and classical influence,"I first became familiar with Sarah Brightman when ""Phantom of the Opera"" took Broadway by storm. On this disc -- my first Sarah Brightman CD -- it sounds as if Ms. Brightman has submitted herself to quite a bit of vocal training. She has lost a fair amount of the nasal quality that I found strangely pleasing in her earlier days, but I must say the training has not hurt her in the slightest. I believe this disc would be wonderful for others like me who are really listening to classical music for the first time in their lives. Though the more contemporary sounds on the album are not displeasing to me, the operatic selections made me stop in my tracks while putting up Christmas decorations. This is a worthy CD to add to yur collection"
3,Fantasic Song!!,I would buy this just for the first song 'Time To Say Goodbye'. The other songs don't really impress me. 'Dive' by Sarah is better. Time to Say Goodbye is AWSOME!!!
1,TIME TO SAY GOOD BYE TO PSEUDO,"My God who are you comparing her to if she is ""oh so great""....hm..let me think...Shania Twain? Indeed, she does have a bit more voice than Shania, maybe even Celine...but c'mon people..listen to some REAL music before you go ahead and rate this garbage as an ""Opera CD""...this couldn't be more PSEUDO than it is! Comparing her to Callas is like comparing some average band keyboardist to Vladimir Horowitz..how dare you? The industry shows it down your throat and u all go buy it... Yeah, it really is a great accompaniment to some ""bubble-bath-victoria secret"" mood...just be careful and make sure that there aren't any serious musicians around listening to you bragg your ignorant praises for ""angelic"" pseudo diva. There is a very VERY thick line that divides the ART and entertainment... i think it's time to say good bye to the ignorance, can't we finally agree?"
2,Outer Space?,"I just finished playing my newly arrived CD of ""Time to Say Goodbye"". I really am disappointed at the quality of the background. Many of the songs seem to have been recorded in an oil barrel or from outer space ...far outer space! The lovely, clear sound of her voice is often lost. I love listening to her so I would probably recommend this CD but only after advising people that it's not up to the quality of other recordings I have heard of her music."
3,no translations :-(,"After having heard La Luna and Eden, Time To Say Goodbye was a slight disappointment. The evolution of her music is evident. I do not care for Jose's voice, it's a little too strong and lacks the emotion of Andrea. I wish there were translations to the music so I could understand what is being said, which La Luna has. ""There for Me"" is my favorite song on the CD, it's very ""american pop ballad"" genre. There are three Spanish songs which are extremely moving and poignant. ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" is a standard favorite of Sarah's. If you are like me, and collect her music just because of her voice, then buy this. If you want the pop/classical edge buy Eden or La Luna. This CD reminds me of the Andrew L.Webber sound, although Frank Peterson produced it (who ALWAYS does a great job!)"
5,MAMA'S MEMORIAL TRIBUTE,"My Mother, 81, passed away due to ovarian cancer on May 17, 2001......this CD was a favorite.....as the ending of my Mother's Memorial Service, May 20, at my request, the organist played this entire CD while we had visitation. It was absolutely perfect and everyone was very emotionally moved. Now, while home alone, I play it & recall wonderful memories of my Mother...what a beautiful tribute. Thank you!"
5,"BEAUTIFUL VOICE- BUT HOWEVER, NOT FULLY TRAINED","I think SArah's voice is wonderful, and all of the songs in this cd are suitable for her and her voice,However, I think she could use some more training, to improve her phrasing and control over her operatic soprano. She really needs to improve her pronounciation - especially in "" O mio Babbino Caro"".This doesn't say her voice is small- in some parts its really grand, and is nore beautifull then many other overrated sopranoes.All in all- a must have cd for fans of pretty, pure voices- with angelic qualities (which sometimes remind a choir soloist). The 3 duets are heavenly (especially Jose Cura), and so is Mozart's Alleluja, /which is sung here better then any other version I have haerd- with beautifull yet not shrill corlatura. my recommendation- BUY IT!"
5,How to shake depresion,"I have a bit of sadness in me at times. While driving home tonight to my shangrila in the Wyoming mountains (a 35 mile drive) I inserted this disk in my receiver and listened to Sarah's beautiful voice (and Bocheli's pretty good too). By the time I got home, no more depression."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"Her voice reigns supreme, but there are just too many selections on this CD in foreign languages. I knew that when I bought it, but...I still find it distracking. My solution? I bought two other Sarah CDs!!"
1,Gimmicky album,"It's a gimmicky album more than anything else. The voice of Sarah Brightman is so small in size and so limited in expressive range that these aren't at all enjoyable performances. In the more classical style songs, she's just not up to standard. Despite the popularity of this album, this cannot be recommended from a musical perspective."
4,Tragically Beautiful...,Sarah Brightman's voice is so haunting...my favorite piece on this CD is La Wally. Her range is so beautiful...I could listen to her sing all day.
5,Sarah Brightman has a beautiful voice.,"Ever since I saw ""The Phantom of the Opera"" I have been enchanted by Sarah Brightman's voice. She puts me in a surreal place with her range and her music. ""Time to Say Goodbye"" is one of my favorite CD's and Sarah Brightman is one of my favorite artists."
4,A beautiful voice but not operatic,"Ok, so maybe Sarah Brightman doesn't have the most powerful and strong soprano voice but so what! Her voice is beautiful nonetheless. While it is also true that in certain instances on this album she is drowned out by the orchestra or her duet partner, (and anyone who really listens to this album really cannot deny that, because it is a fact) it still doesn't take away from the crystalline sound that is her voice. Maybe like the previous reviewer stated, this could have been remedied in the mixing room. But this is still a beautiful record and is a pleasure to listen to."
4,The hour of the gate: A Spellsinger Adventure,"This I rated just a tad more cause it was just that little extra. Why I dunno. But my take was like Alan seemed more comfortable with this sequel. Fact or fancy, as always it's an excellent read, thanks."
3,Tinker Bell costume for short girls only,"I am 5'8 1/2"" tall and very thin. The length of the body suit was too short on me! Apparently Tink was not a tall, slender gal! I wore it with a shirt under it and the straps ""off shoulder"" so that it would work but if I were not underweight for an adult, I would never have been able to have done that. If I had seen the costume in a store I would not have bought it. If I had been able to try it on before buying it I would not have bought it.I did receive it in good shape and in a reasonable amount of time. It's a shame I couldn't shrink to Tinker Bell size to wear it for Halloween night!"
3,Can design but is a storage hog,4 stars for ease of use. 3 stars for design (limited) 1 star for the size. It takes 733 MB aslmost as much as MSOffice. It takes FOREVER to uninstall. I was irratated with it. Get much more with Photoshop Elements.
1,Highly unsuitable for young children,"This terribly dreadful story invloving the kidnapping of children and using hair to make lace is totally out of tune with the previous Madeline videos. Whatever positive message the writers intended just gets obliterated in the dark aspects of the story. I viewed it with my 4yr old who was physically shivering (yes!) at various points of the show. When it got too much, she told me to turn it off, something she's never done when it comes to Madeline. I watched it to the end and found it confusing that Madeline is presented here as an orphan. An earlier video, Madeline's Christmas, clearly shows her papa & mama. Overall, a dismal effort in the research, writing and presentation of a Madeline story. Very disappointing."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a disastrous episode in the Madeline chronicles. I gave this video one star only because the posting screen will not allow me to rate it zero or negative stars! The film tells the story of the orphan Madeline being kidnapped into slavery by an evil gang of lace makers. The terrifying story line left my three-year-old twin daughters blubbering in fear! Blatantly contradicts all previous storylines by orphaning Madeline. Definitely not suitable for my children, yours should approach with extreme caution."
3,Distressing adaption of Madeline - Not for the very young,"I watched this movie before I let my 3-year-old daughter watch it, and I'm glad I did because I don't want her to see it. It is too dark for little girls--there's kidnapping, sickness, child labor, threats, lying, and general fear. It should not be shown to young children because of its dark themes. It's true that there are redeeming themes of perserverence, cooperation, and friendship, but they are overshadowed by the overall story. Although it is for older children, I don't plan on owning it because of the negative feelings it gave *me*. You would do better to get the 25-minute videos such as ""Madeline and the Bad Hat,"" ""Madeline's Rescue,"" and ""Madeline at the Ballet."" The songs are better, the stories more uplifting, and the overall tones are easier on the tender feelings of young girls and boys."
1,Who creates these things?,"It is shocking that movies as frightening as these are released for children. It seems that the people who created this film have no idea about children. Who comes up with this stuff? And offers it to children? Are they kidding? I returned this ""G rated"" video for a refund."
1,"Very Scary, Disturbing movie","I don't normally write reviews, but since this has given my son nightmares for many days now, I'm writing. My 7 year old son saw this on TV. He doesn't normally get nightmares, and he enjoys almost all cartoons. This one was really scary. It should be called ""Madeline gets kidnapped and enslaved by abusive adults in a sweatshop in Paris."" First, in typical Disney fashion, Madeline's parents get killed off. I wasn't paying as much attention to this movie as I should have been, but when I tuned in next Madeline was being cornered in a dungeon by a scary women wielding a large, sharp scissors. My son has been in tears every night for a week. Definitely don't buy this!"
3,So-so,"The animation and music were great! The drawings and shadows were better than the TV series. However, I must comment on the fact that this movie contradicts the other Madeline series and books, in that she is not an orphan, and had that been in mind, the movie would not have existed. I've noticed in some scenes, some almost ""inappropiate"" shots (and I use that term loosely!). Have you?"
1,"Horrible, Frightening","This is a terrible video in which Madeline is abducted by a supposed ""Uncle"". She is taken to a dungeon like setting to make lace from human hair. Worse, if it can be, Ms. Clavell and the other adults who are supposed to care for her, just let her go off with this ""Uncle"". She is betrayed by all the adults, and even by ""family"" in the person of her ""Uncle"". My 5 year old was visibly shaken, and we fast forwarded through the last 30 minutes to Madeline's rescue. Just a terrible video, made all the worse because of the previous uplifting Madeline series. This is a negative five stars!"
2,Skip this Madeline,"We are all huge Madeline fans here in our home, but this movie is not a good one. Parts of it are scarry and just not fun for kids and it's pretty boring. The Madeline dvd's with episodes are much better- we have a few of those and love them."
4,To each his own - my 2-year-old girl loves it!!,"All kids are different. My 2 1/2 year old, who gets very upset when Mustafa dies in the Lion King, has no fear of the villainess La Croc in this film at all. It's her current favorite and she has watched this movie almost daily for the last two weeks. (I know, I let her watch too much TV, don't tell me!) The music is very catchy, the animation is cute and maybe my daughter will pick up a few words in French? I'll admit there are some silly plot developments, but hey, it's for kids. For those children who are traumatized by the events in this film, I suggest they are particularly sensitive children who might well be upset even by traditional fairy tales like Hansel and Gretel. If your kid is one, then by all means skip the movie. If you have a fearless, launch-into-midair-without-looking child like mine, she will probably love it."
2,not for young kids,"My daughter loves the episodes of Madeline, but not this movie. The main plot is an uncle takes Madeline away from her friends and puts her to work in a sweat shop. Creepy!!"
1,Inappropriate for young children,"As a mother of 4 small kids, Trust me, this is inappropriate for young kids. The thems are disturbing and too much for young children."
4,good starter kit,The dremel 300 is a good kit to start using a dremel tool. A dremel rotarty tool is an amazing tool.
5,Great fun,"I have destroyed a lot of stuff with the unexpected power of this tool. It is good, but any tool is only as good as its handler."
5,Great for pets!,"We purchased this item specifically to trim pet claws. Well, my 85 pound German Shepherd is a big baby when it comes to nail clippings, and she did not mind the Dremel at all! Plus, now my husband has a new tool for his garage. =)"
5,It's the best grinder for pet nails,"I've used this Dremel product several years for grinding pet nails, Dalmatians and Standard Poodles. It is dependable, reliable, sturdy, and easy to maintain in top shape. Your dog will get used to it quickly. This grinder allows you to do very precise work to keep your dog's nails looking great."
5,Fantastic & versitale tool!,"At the time, I found this set to be the best value Dremel package The people at Dremel are very friendly & helpful to talk to as well. Great product that does everything I want it to and I look forward to my next projects with it!"
2,Not my favorite in the series,As with the previous book I found this one very hard to get into. I guess as Betsy got older she lost a lot of her appeal for me. While I cherish the ones when they were in their elementary years. I found this one a real bore. It took me a week to get through it and that was forcing myself.The character Betsy for me was kind of silly. I could not relate to her. I understand she took the trip to get over losing Joe but she could never really stop thinking about him.Ms. Lovelace did a very good job of descibing the countries which a love to read about. One thing I can say is that this book made me want to go visit Venice.Most fans of the series would love this but to me I guess I was not really in the mood.I rate this a 2/5.FCC Disclaimer: I borrowed this from my local library. I am also an Amazon Associate. I was not paid for my opinion and what is expressed is solely my opinion.
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"A great story and great dialogue. This is a well constructed book that has great characters and great imagery but also manages to keep the story moving along. While i am sure my enjoyment was enhanced because i read it while in Italy, I would have enjoyed reading this anywhere. It is a great portrait of small town Italy and of people.It is also interesting in this story of the US liberation of Italy, that it was written in the mid-1940s and has a thinly-veiled very negative portrayl of General Patton."
3,"A strong first half, but lost steam","I enjoyed The Alchemist, but I felt that it could have been a much better book if the second half had been as exciting and gripping as the first half.The book starts in Ancient Egypt and ends in the present day, wending its way through history. Well over half the book is set in ancient Egypt. This portion of the book is exciting and unpredictable. It tells the tale of three young magicians and what happens when they combine their powers. There were several times when the twists and turns in the plot took me by complete surprize.The second half sees the three separateds into various combinations of two and one. This part of the book is much less imaginative. I found some of things to be a bit predicatable, while in other places I just found the outcome slightly disappointing.This is a good book, but the second half didn't live up to the promise of the first half."
3,Reading with Tequila,"This story of Ancient Egypt and dark magic could have been more enjoyable if it had been written slightly differently. The Alchemist contains a great concept that was written well, but not in a style I particularity like. The wording is heavy on the description and that seems to prevent the storyline from gathering any steam. This book spans from Ancient Egypt to present day in just 240 pages, so the great ideas presented in the book aren't expanded on much. The book is short, but by no means an easy read.I've very much enjoyed some of Donna Boyd's other books, but The Alchemist doesn't come close. The book just isn't that memorable. If you're interested in Egyptology, immortal beings or magic, you can find a decent story in The Alchemist, but nothing truly fantastic."
3,A Bit on the Superfluous Side,"While the story was overall entertaining, the way it was told was a bit too wordy for our liking. At times Boyd went on and on about minute details that really were not necessary for the story to go on. Sometimes her descriptions took away from something that was exciting/interesting in the book; sometimes we were reading just to get to the next part of what happened in the story and often found ourselves skipping over sections of detail just to get to those parts. The best way to describe this book is a little story wrapped up in superfluous detail about wall hangings and pictures and smells. I think the story would have made for a great short story, but not the 200 some pages Boyd makes it into."
2,A Poor Man's Anne Rice .... Disappointing,"While the idea is a good one, Boyd's history is shaky and her story painfully predictable. If she had fleshed out the story to include the colour of the various periods in history it might be more interesting, but as it stands, it is pretty shallow. The characters and their exploits are cliche and seemed to be taken from any one of Anne Rice's Vampire books. I was disappointed in the lack of richness and detail. This one man's redemption just isn't that interesting."
2,Dissapointed...,"I also was a HUGE fan of The Promise and The Passion. I had never read 2 books more engrossing and hypnotic as those books. With The Alchemist, Ms. Boyd loses a lot of the steam she had going with her first two novels. This book was boring. I kept telling myself to keep reading because I was such a fan of her Devoncroix werewolf novels that I just was expecting greatness, but it never came in this book. The descriptives are WAY too long and at some points you feel like you are almost drunk or high from the drawn out, pointless detailings. I found myself ""reading"", or basically just looking at words but not taking them in for almost half of this short book. The story was predictable. I knew the therapist was connected by blood from the very start. I just hope Donna Boyd comes back with her powerful, epic Devoncroix Dynasty series! This book was a huge let down. I'm sorry Donna Boyd...I loved your werewolf books, but this was just not a good one."
4,Good reference book.,"I have enjoyed reading this book. It has good reviews of each of the brothers' films (together and solo) as well as behind the scenes information about the films. In addition there are interesting items such as shelfed projects, live shows, wigs, etc. It does suffer from not having biographies of the individual Marxes (although there are multiple informative biographies of supporting players). Also some type of summary table of contents would have been helpful; something that would have grouped the types of entries such as biographies, references to costumes, etc.I received this & the Three Stooges Encyclopedia at the same time. The Marxes encyclopedia is the way it SHOULD be done."
4,"Interesting, sensitive, not very well structured","An undoubtedly interesting, worth reading book. Not very well structured though. Too much emphasis and interposition of personal experiences and emotions. I would prefer more information on the habitat and the local people. The book failed to project the anthropological aspect the title promises. Photograph quality should definitely be improved in next edition."
3,Shadow of Man Review,"The book In the Shadow of Man I found in the begginig to kind of boring. Just because the book was kind of slow moving at first. It talked a little bit about her childhood, and how she got to Africa. I didn't find it very exciting then. I wanted to get right to the action. Then in the middle of the book it got really exciting, because Jane Goodall talks about how she finally got to have some real interactions with the chimps, instead of them always running away from her, and keeping a safe distance. Also how she would feed them bannanas, and she gets married and things like that. So the rest of the book from the middle on I found prettie interesting and exciting. And if you like animals and are ok with a boring beggining to a book, but an exciting middle and finish, then I would reccomend this book to you. I liked it a little bit, but it wasn't my favorite book, but that's just me. Check it out for yourself, and see what you think!"
4,Jane Goodall's Observations on Chimpanzees,"A really fine volume. Jane Goodall describes her study of chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream in Tanzania. She and her team has studied these animals over a long period of time. This covers the social behavior of the chimpanzees in the earlier years of the study.The story occurs at several levels. One, simply, is the interaction of individuals with their own personalities--Flo, David, Goliath, Faben, Merlin, Passion, and so on. Another level is the group/society. What is the structure of the society studies?The book covers the life cycle of chimpanzees in this environment-- from infant on. It explores relations with other species. It looks at the variety of behaviors that characterize chimpanzee society--reproduction, feeding, hierarchy, predation, and so on. The book also addresses the challenges facing chimpanzees as humans encroach further.In the end, a riveting book, well worth reading."
4,Emotive but Good,"I think that the first few chapters are crucial to her story. If it had started in the Gombe Reserve and just been a straight account of her observations, frankly, I would have stopped 40 pages into it. I don't think she lingers too long on this.Shortly after, she begins to introduce the reader to the chimps as individuals. Even though the book is filled with her telling us about the chimps, she does also show us things she's learned by vividly describing an instance or action. I liked that she doesn't hide the fact that she has opinions (from the reader.) Even though I do not share many of her opinions, I found her to be an honest writer."
3,I can't believe that they are so young!,"This group is very young, still in high school in fact. However, their voices show a lot of maturity and room for improvement. The cd is good for varying types of moods, but it just wasn't all I expected. ""No, no, no"" Part 1 and 2 were good. And overall, the cd is pretty relaxing."
2,Not what I expected,"Okay... I loved ""No, no, no"" and I just KNEW that the rest of the album was going to be the bomb. But when I heard it, it was very safe to say that it was very disappointing. I loved the group before I heard the album- but now I view them as just another one hit wonder girlie group. They have a lot of talent- but they need to get better songs. Support them if you wish- but I don't highly suggest it. I was more impressed by the ""No, no, no"" single that I was with the whole album."
5,I heard the CD before and it was excellent!!!!!,"Well I thought the CD was the bomb. Mostly because all 4 of them are so talented.I'm in chorus and I hope when I get older I grow up to be as talented as they are.Well if you need a backup singer or dancer I'll be right there.Destiny's Child is hopefully going to last for a long time. Way more than TLC, probably because Destiny's Child are the bomb."
2,This compact disc was a form of modern art.,"The new group Destiny's Child has ""blown up"" since their first appearance on the screen. I feel that these are great songs on this disc, but however they do seem a little redundant. It seems as if though they needed some music to fill in their cd with part ones and twos. I do encourage this young group to keep up the good work and be strong despite my comments. i did not like no, no,no the fast version. But, for teenagers this is a very trendy beat and something parents do not have to ""inspect"" first."
2,FAIR!!!!!!!!!,THIS ALBUM IS OKAYNOT THEIR BEST.A FEW SONGS ARE GOODOTHER THANTHAT THIS ALBUMIS FAIR.PURCAHSE IT WITH YOURMONEY INTELLIGENTLY!!!!!!!!!
1,Destiny's CHild makes me laugh in a evil laugh,"I laughed at how the two band members broke up with those other remaining member of Destiny's Child easily they replaced those other two. It just shows how easy it is to make and replace a crappy pop group. It shows how easy it is to make these silly POP bands. If two members of Metallica left people would have a hell of a hard time adjusting to the new people and the band wouldn't be the same but for crappy POP bands all you need is another pretty face that can sing. Oh and the songs like Bills Bills Bills, Bug a Boo, Say My name grow tiring so quickly after a month or two. You won't be listening to this CD next year, you'll be giving this to a used CD store just so you can get some money back. So your better off buying a empty soda can than this CD. Thank You, Have A Nice Day!"
4,The bomb,I really like the albums and it is the bomb. Ibe sitting in my room reminscemce off of it .Thinking about my man and everyhing. But yall keep sing and keep it real and live for the y2k. One love
5,"I play it all the time, best female group since En Vogue",Me and my friend consider our selves to be critics in the music industry and DESTINYS CHILD is at the top right now . The people that work on your cd such as; MASTER P & WYCLEF JEAN are great artists and add a good flavor to your cd. Keep up the good work and see ya on your next cd. Look out for THE ROAD DAWGS from INGLEWOOD this summer you may want them to do some stuff with you in the future. They are the BOMB...........
4,Off to a good start,"I am a Destiny's Child fan but I picked up this CD last because I didn't think its wasn't going to be that good. The vocals are awesome, suprising its not just Beyonce singing with background singers. Beyonce's voice wasn't stellar here whcih gives the Cd a different sound. Pick it up if you are a DC fan if not you'll probably still like it.Favs are Second Nature, With me pt1, both No, No, No's and Show me the way"
2,The cd that started it all.,"Well, this album was farrrrr from good. The vocals are exceptional, and all the songs aren't bad, but most of them are. Highlights are ""Second Nature"", ""No,no, no (1 and 2)"" and ""Bridges"", but when only 4 of the songs suceed to tickle my fancy, you just haven't done your job. The girls harmonize well on this album, and it's not all Beyonce all over the background. And on leads, her voice sounds pure, and not all overproduced and hollering. This was in no way special, but I've heard worse. They've gotten a lot better, and I was a fan when this cd came out when I was nine, but now I'm a die hard fan. They get a ""B"" for effort."
2,"Uptempo songs are fantastic, but slow songs not as good","I loved Destiny's Child the minute I heard a bit of the ""No, No, No"" video. But I usually end up skipping through at least half the songs on the album. ""No, No, No"" parts I & II, ""With Me"" parts I & II, and ""Illusion"" are very danceable and these women's voices are beautiful. Harmonies are great and the fast songs really make you want to sing along.Their voices didn't seem to be used as well on the slower songs. The arrangements didn't compliment their talents as well as on the faster songs, the backings (bass, synthesizers, etc.) were unimaginative, and overall, they just seemed flat and overly sentimental.After listening to this album many times and always skipping over so many songs, I'm wishing they'd released a shorter album with only about 5 of these songs instead of the full-length one."
5,Destiny's Child CD is the bomb.,"whoever do not have the CD is crazy.Cause it is tight and I love the song Bills,Bills,Bills."
1,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!!!","These girls can sing but it would be nice in a while to hear them sing something new besides ""NO, NO, NO."" I have listend to the rest of their CD and it was a big disapointment to what I had expected it to be. Most of their songs are really dull and not very good. I think they should work on the lyrics to their songs and think about what messeage they want to send out to the world."
3,it is worth buying,"this is a nice album to listen to its ok it was not all of that but 2 songs i like on here isno,no,no, part 1my time has comeother then that the album was ok i give it 3 stars"
5,Great Record From a Great Band,"The final release from Upstate New York's Uncle Sam. Part punk, part metal, part garage rock with a touch of mid-tempo sleaze/grunge/glam thrown in for good measure."
3,better live on youtube,"I started listening to these guys live on youtube, sang with real passion and had a high level of rawness which i liked. Then I got the album and it plays so clean, no rawness, which is why i liked them in the first place. Dissapointed."
5,"It's like 'Train' but 'Brain', clever.","Superb. Is just one word I could use to describe the sometimes mental piece of plastic that is this Crocketts CD. From the soft twangs of such audio majesty as 'Survival of the Prettiest' to the less subtle trailblazings of 'Lucifer' this album was born to satisfy. Satisfy it does, and then some. Not often will such a quirky album be worth your dollarage, but this is well warranted, and will give you kudos from your friends for having weird UK music that is not the Beatles. Do it, buy it, you will be popular."
2,The eighties revisited,"McKibben has carefully revamped an older version of a previous book, and it is obvious.The End of Nature would have been insightful a decade or two ago but I found nothing overtly inspiring or new here.Any interested readers should seek more recent books. I recommend Chris Patten, 'What Next? Survivng the 21st Century.'"
2,Old ideas,"Interesting that when you look at the predictions made in the book about what things would be like today, nothing has come true. No way Bill was trying to scare anyone, he based his arguments on ""science"". Can't blame him though, we can't even predict the weather two weeks from now, much less 20 years."
3,More Heart Than Fact,"This novel is a touching polemic about the voracious appetite of mankind to chew up and taint ""Nature"" - but it is so one sided that it's not a scientific examination of the subject. It's more like a poem or an ode to an earlier time. I enjoyed the book, but recognize it's shortcomings"
4,Awesome Sounds,Good soundtrack if you love metal and rock. Honestly I love that song Degenerated. Which is the song they play in the movie. Its awesome and worth it.
2,Falls a Bit Short,"The premise is a great one. Brain Slade, star of glam rock fakes his own death then vanishes with the scam is revealed. Ten years later he becomes the focus of a ""whatever happened to"" story being done by a reporter who sets out to find him.Unfortunately the execution of this idea falls a bit flat. The look of the movie is great with an excellent eye for glam era period detail. The performances, particularly from Ewan McGreggor (whose character is clearly modeled after Iggy Pop) and Toni Colette (as Slade's wife) are first rate and, at least at first, the ""Citizen Kane"" references are very sharp and entertaining.But this is a movie, despite all its best efforts, cant quite add up to the sum of its parts. The script fails to fully involved and after a while the ""Citizen Kane"" allusions become tiresome and come across as self important.Not a bad movie, but far from a great one. Overall 2 and a half stars."
3,First and Foremost.....,"I have read several pages now of reviews. This movie seems to either be loved or passionately hated. Despite these differences though, one common element remains, the repetitive and unnecessary references to David Bowie. YES, we get the point that this movie may possibly be about Bowie, we don't really need to hear it from every reviewer. Ok, pat yourselves on the back, you're bloody rock experts, now shut up and move on.Now for my review. I actually rather liked this movie. The plot is a bit dumb but the other elements of the film almost make up for it. The soundtrack is stunning, especially the T-Rex song, and the actors do an amazing job. Ewan MacGregor is, in my opinion, the best actor in the whole show. He displays, as he usually does, his energy, flamboyance, and private body parts. With all that, who could ask for more from a movie?"
2,Meh.,"I have a quest. I'm a huge fan of Ewan McGregor, so I want to see all of his movies. I was pretty excited to see Velvet Goldmine because I heard it was good. Sadly, I was misinformed. Maybe it's because I'm not into glam rock or something, but nothing about this movie really did it for me. I thought it was rather dull, actually. I expected McGregor, as the top-billed actor, to have a larger role, and while I did see a lot of him (all of him, in fact... wink, wink), I wanted to know more about his character and see more of his performance.In general, I found this movie lacking. There wasn't enough plot to keep me interested, and the music wasn't good enough to keep it going for me. I thought this movie was rather blah."
