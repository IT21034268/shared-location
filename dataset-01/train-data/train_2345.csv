5,The other 2/3's of the job,"Ask any author and they'll tell you: writing the book is only a third of the work. Marketing the book is the other 2/3's. As scary as writing can be, marketing is like looking into an abyss. The ideas are endless, but the disasterous results are just as endless. Carmen Leal has taken the fear and guess work out of the maddness...by giving us an easy to read, easy to follow format for making the most of our work. By using the plotline of Lilies of the Field, the writer/reader sees the simplicity and joy of a ""job well done!"""
5,It is a very touching story and also and very good book.,"Mrs.Pitts wrote a very good story about her late husband and the rest of her family who were there for her during this trying time and everybody needs to buy this book it is worth the money!Thank you,Mr.Antanasia Campbell"
2,"Not ""Traditional""","While others have given the DVD a good review, I must say that I was rather disappointed in it. While the instruction techniques were sufficient, the instructor herself appeared to be more of an actor than a trained dancer. Also, the music, instead of being turkish or egyptian, was more 'techno', which definitely didn't seem to compliment Belly Dancing techniques.Overall, I gave this a 2-star review. It's adequate, but note that it does not follow what many people may consider for ""traditional"" bellydancing."
2,Not worth it,"I got this DVD as a gift, and I am thankful I did not spend my own money on it. On the plus side, the instructor does seem to be a gifted dancer, and the moves are broken down in an intersting way. There is an on-screen geometric reprsentation of each move, but I found it to be terribly distracting.If you are interested in actually learning to bellydance, steer clear of this DVD. It is focused on moves to use in the club to spice up your usual dance routine. If you do want to learn bellydance moves for the club, try[...] instead. The instruction is better, the music is less annoying, and there is a better emphasis on freestyle dancing."
1,It cures insomnia....,"It's not entertaining, it's not informative, it's simply a waste of money. Your're paying good money for some kind of ""Don't drink and drive, we catch You anyway""-Documentation. Everyone knows that, for gods sake! But if I want to see something about Las Vegas Cheating, I want to see it happening. You can't learn cheating from a video for sure - but it gives You a thrill to watch it. That's what's it all about. There's no thrill. And by the way...I've heard that's not only the gamblers who are trying to cheat. What's my protection against being cheated? That DVD is not telling You the other side of the story. Is it a ""Powered by casinos""-DVD? The joke is on me...I bought this DVD."
1,Doesn't work for the nuts I was trying to crack,"This seemed to be a good product, but I was using it to open macadamia nuts and it worked quite well for a while and then the handle cracked where the black part meets the silver. It was useless to me, but I was thankful that the company, Oneida had a lifetime warranty and I was able to get the money back from themThe nut crackers for macadamias, are very expensive so I am thinking of creating my own vice grip type device to stabilize the nut and then crack with a nail and hammer"
1,Broken Nut Cracker!,"After using my Oneida Nutcracker very little, the handle literally broke off! I was stunned. On the side it says ""Lifetime Warranty,"" but I have no idea how to make a claim."
5,A Classic,What can I say about PAAS -- they are THE company for egg dye and I was pleased as always !!! Nice colors. :)
3,Just what you ask for,"It's what you need to decorate eggs. Tablets, follow the instructions and do it. Comes with the lil crayon to make white designs on them, stickers, egg holders, placers and all that stuff. Works good enough."
4,Stoner Glass cleaner pump spray,I've tried almost all the glass cleaner products on the market but Stoner glass cleaners are the best. The aerosol can is a much better way to go than the pump spray. You get more applications for you $$ with the pump but the aerosol foam works even better and stays in place till you finish polishing the glass.
1,Broke on First Usage,"After receiving this wrench and breaking it out for the first usage (only set at 76 lbs!), the tightening ratchet completely broke, leaving the product useless - RETURNED."
5,A great little torque wrench,I used this to properly torque the bolts on my cars transmission and it worked out great. Very easy to dial in the exact torque and the knurled handle is great for preventing slips.
1,Avoid this wrench!,"Now that spring has sprung, I thought I would take out the Mountain 16200 torque wrench I got this past Christmas and give it a whirl.I have read the instructions repeatedly, and certain that I am operating the wrench correctly, and am unable to get the wrench to click at ANY TORQUE SETTING.I've missed the return window on the wrench, and there doesn't appear to be any sort of warranty.I suggest other potential owners try their luck on other wrenches (as I am about to do)."
3,"Uncertain, perplexed, disappointed","I have never purchased--or used--a torque wrench before so clarity would have been useful. The ""Mountain 16200"" is advertised as 20-200 in/lbs. That was my mistake for not noticing that it was in/lbs not ft/lbs--but not to worry the item sent was a 3/8"" inch drive torque wrench classified as 10-80ft/lbs (which is not 20-200in/lbs). It has scales in ft/lbs, Kgm and Nm. The instructions although useable do not actually match the tool provided. There is nothing on the tool about the brand. It is a substantial tool. The biggest disappointment was that this same tool sells on the seller's web site for close to $21 not $34. It appears there is an Amazon sur-charge. So based only on the above and not the actual quality of the tool I only give it three stars."
1,Horrible product - don't buy it!!,"I bought this product after some research and what a horrible product it is. I opened the package and the instructions was in ft-lb and N-M, which got me very suspicious considering this is a in-lb wrench. And the first time I tried to used it on my car, I set it at 10 in-lb just to be safe, and the wrench never clicked and I almost stripped the thread. I'm now borrowing a friend's wrench and will never use this anywhere near my car. Take my word for it, don't buy it. You will regret using it on anything that's important to you."
1,mountain 20-200 lb torque wrench,this torque wrench broke the first time i used it i was torquing down a bolt and i hear this snap! and then it did not do anything after that just kept spinning and did not work!
4,Not a bad price,I needed this wrench to change the timing belt on my car. Since I usually perform my own auto maintenance I decide that I should just invest in a decent tool. After throughly researching various other manufacturers I decided on the Mountain product due to its favorable reviews from Amazon and other sites.The tool is well made and has a solid feel. Every visible part is metal (as opposed to plastic) and the torque graduations are permanently embossed on the tool. The letters are small (although it would be hard to make them any larger due to the size of the tool) and may be difficult for some people to read. It has a durable plastic case for storage and a paper conversion chart. I'm sure that a better product can be purchased but you can expect to spend from $60 to $100 for the same type tool.
5,Do it right the FIRST time.,This Torque Wrench is an excellent value the quality and finish was better than I had expected and fit my project needs perfectly. Shipping prompt.
3,Not what I thought,"the songs are not really a great format for memorizing facts (for my child). Instead of ""2 x 2 is four!"" the songs are products ""2, 4, 6, 8"" etc. Recalling them are more difficult once you get past counting by 5's. But, my daughter is listening for 15 minutes per day and is slowly picking them up."
2,Disappointed,"Given the other review was so incredibly positive, I was excited to purchase this product. My kids got to the third song and asked me to turn it off because the music was ""lame."" I have to say, the songs are pretty hokey. Can't learn the songs without listening to the cd, so I will try to put it in the car and see if they warm up to it. . ."
5,The ultimate book on San Francisco Bay Area baseball!,"This book is a must for baseball fans! Dick Dobbins does an outstanding job covering the history of baseball in the San Francisco Bay Area. With his outstanding knowledge of the players and the teams, the rich history is brought to life. Mr. Dobbins collection of photographs and memorabilia from the old Pacific Coast League is the highlight of the book."
5,LOVE the Pillows!,"We love FLCL, LOVE the Pillows, and love this sound track. I'm not even sure what else to say! If you love FLCL, this is the soundtrack, simple as that. Good quality. Catchy J-pop tunes. It's great getting to know the songs on their own, then hear them again in the story. Buy it!"
2,Don't buy cheap/dangerous,"The bag received did not look like the one pictured, ugly plaid boy color not appropriate for daughter. cheap fabric that feels like the toys could be poked out of or ripped. The edges are not finished safely so daughter's cheek was cut by the plastic sheet that sticks out. There are other ones from other companies that are better quality, don't buy this!!"
3,yeah and meh,"I just watched the entire Contacts series. A must for teachers of photography.I'm a huge fan of the Series #1 which gives us another look at the origins ofclassic photojournalism. But I watched the entire series...an in the end, talentis talent...using the ability to organize light and composition and a point ofview. I was surprised to find a few photographers in the #3 series that are as inspiring as their historic pioneers."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I received this book as a gift, and read it out of obligation. About 20 pages in, I was hooked! The author has a very good descriptive style, and made me feel for the main characters. The best thing about this novel was that one can learn an amazing amount of information about the Bosnia/Serbia war, something Americans in general are unfamiliar with. My word of warning is that this novel is very graphic, something akin to the WWII concentration camps. However, graphic violence aside, this was an ecxellent book."
5,Excellent overview of ITIL v2,"This has been invaluable as a tool for learning about and teaching about ITIL. I have shared it with, and recommended it to, many colleagues and clients. I hope the authors are preparing an update for ITIL v3"
1,Not the pictured item.,The picture shows a brass fitting that is threaded into the body. The one I recived did not thread in. It was built into the body. Cant be removed and not what I wanted.
2,"Ahoy, Submariners - here's a great comedy for you!","This movie is supposed to be a drama, but it was actually a comedy. Imagine a top-secret mission, and the man in charge calling to tell his son about it on an unsecured land-line. (You military people will understand about that!) Imagine you are in the command center of a nuclear submarine (for civilians, this is a small room filled from ceiling to floor with gauges, screens, dials, controls, etc.) and there are a bunch of men shooting at each other with automatic weapons - and not one piece of equipment is damaged. All you Submariners should watch this movie. I'd give it Zero stars, but it is really funny, so I gave it 2 stars just for the ridiculous parts."
1,Don't be fooled,"I bought this record because I love Therapy?'s album ""Troublegum."" In fact--it's one of my favorite rock records. When I was reading about their newest release, I kept seeing people say how this was a great ""rock and roll"" album. This is anything but the truth.The songs go nowhere, the vocals are annoying, and the lyrics, which are not printed in the CD, are not recognizable. I understand that bands much change but Therapy? needs to go back to ""Troublegum"" and see what worked on that album to produce another great CD. ""Suicide Pact"" simply does not work. I could not even listen to one song the whole way through-a huge disappointment.Buy ""Troublegum,"" not this."
5,Genius,I love it... and you will too! Therapy? have gone back to thedays of Nurse and the two CS EPs. Pure sounds of PRE-TroubleGum Noisemixed in with a bit of Elvis and funky early rock 'n' rollriffs. Buy it!
3,Not too bad but not the best one ....,"Okay, I've spent my teen listening to Therapy? and they did some really Killer albums, like Troublegum or Infernal Love. Then their drummer left and they got a new guitarist as well. When I bought semi-detached I knew that something has changed. I think that Semi-Detached was a kind of good bye to the ""commercial"" Therapy? and this one show us the brand new Therapy?. I just miss the good old lyrics and voice (! ) from troublegum....But don't judge this album the first time you hear it, take the time to listen to it and try to understand the lyrics (which is not the easiest part ...)"
2,A bland tell all but it reads easy,The most interesting take away from this book was the fact that Count Basie used to wait outside the bank in New York until someone he knew came along and he could have them cash his checks for him. Amazing.
1,Not worth the price,"If you really want information on the big bands, this is not your book. There is a lot of information on the sex lives of big band leaders but even more info on the slights suffered by the author.Even the pictures are an attempt to show how important Bernie Woods was, including one of his golf foursome."
1,I am so disappointed!,Don't wast your money buying this movie. It is not the 36th Chamber of Shaolin everyone wants. Buy Master Killer if you want the good version.
4,Want to see a martial art action movie,"One of the best martial art movie that I have ever seen. The 36th. chamber of shaolin is similar to the movie ""Enter the Dragon"". This is an action packed movie and a must see for all martial art fans."
1,This is NOT the 36th Chamber that you know and love!,"About 14 years ago I was fortunate enough to catch the original ""36th Chamber"" on late, late, LATE night TV, and was blown away by everything...the plot, the action, the training sequences, etc. etc.""Enter the 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" is not that film! It is a terrible, wanna-be (but nowhere near) action/comedy, and should be ignored."
2,Anyone Speak Farsi????????,"Ok, the fight scenes are alright, typical old school kung-fu, my only gripe is the bizarre subtitles. The version I got was NOT repeat NOT the DVD I thought I had ordered, but rather a VHS version??!!??!! Well I figured ""SO WHAT, IM EASY AND IT'S WATCHABLE ANYWAYS"". The funny thing is that the post production team must have pushed 3 buttons of subtitles then went to the mall for 90 minutes!! This version had English, Japanese ( I think), and something that looked very much like symbols from the Rosetta stone, all overlapping so one had to struggle to read the english appearing behind 2 other languages, very weird. Still, the film Itself is pretty decent action fare and I have seen worse post-production. I have one GAMERA film where the last 5 minutes of the film revert to the original Japanese, and another where the sound vanishes for the final 15 minutes. Like I said, Im easy to please!!!"
1,GARBAGE!,I can't read the english subtitiles because they go offscreen and anyways they are on for like 1-3 seconds. I can't speed read and pay attention to the action. Also if you look on the back cover of the box then you will notice that those pictures are from another movie! What a bunch of ripoff liers! I wanted to buy the Shaolin Master Killer and not this garbage!
2,Very poor film,This film is one of the worst martial films I've seen. Difinitely not what I expected. I was totally annoyed after the first 15 mins. It was like watching a Video CD. Subtitles were poor. And I fell asleep 3 or 4 times during the film. And I love martial art films
2,When compared with the other Gordon Liu films ive seen :(,"I'm a big fan of Gordon Liu, but this film is not one of his better one's. He plays a young shaolin student who decides to take on the Ming General with the help of some volunteer students played by some of the stars of 5 Deadly Venoms (the toad). The fights in the beginning are good, the training fights are also good, but there is definately too much talking, and the subtitles are hard to read. If your a Gordon Liu collector you have to have this one, but dont' get fooled by the pics on the box, cause they don't appear in the film. An ok film though. Plus Lo Liegh plays the talented bad guy."
2,Looking for 36th Chamber of Shaolin ? Buy Master Killer,"Most of the reviewers of this movie seems to be looking for the original 36th Chamber of Shaolin. The problem with HK movies is that they have a lot of names. The original 36th Chamber of Shaolin is also known as Master Killer. You can find all the AKA (also known as) names on the web site ""Hong Kong Cinema"". I understand that Master Killer has been re-released as Shaolin Master Killer (soon also on DVD!)."
1,NOT The 36th Chamber of Shaulin!!,"Beware this is NOT The 36th Chamber of Shaulin. It is in fact another engish version. If you are looking for the right film, you have to by the one put out by Celestial Pictures. They are like the ""Criterion Collection"" of asian cinema! NOt only is it the right one, it's widescreen, anamorphic with remastered sound with the dupe taked from the master 36mm film! I'm totally amped that Celestial bought out the whole shaw bros. cataloge. They know how to do justice to these old great films unlike the bad bootlegged copies ather companies put out!"
3,Not That Bad,"Not the original Master Killer, and not of that quality...this is still a decent Shaw Brothers movie, with several good fights. It was originally titled Crazy Shaolin Disciples. While that title's not a whole alot better, it was never meant to copy or capitalize on Master Killer. Don't blame the movie for the title it's video distributor gave it."
1,Not the movie I expected,"I agree with the previous review. I was really looking the ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (Master Killer)"" and was VERY disappointed. I agree that it does look like a bootlegged copy."
1,Glad i read the review,"I was looking for the original ""36th Chamber of shaolin"" i saw 15 years ago. I am glad to find that this one is not the one i was looking for."
3,"Not Master Killer, but not all bad","While I agree this is nowhere near the quality of most Gordon Liu films, it does have some good points. Besides having several good fight scenes, it's the only Shaw Brothers film I know of to feature Gordon Liu fighting Lo Mang of the 5 Venoms. You do have to be willing to sit through alot of unfunny zaniness, but I think it's worth it."
3,Average Effort,"Pull back the reigns on this one, there is a lot going on and I just do not think the author had the skill to weave it all together in a tight, convincing way. Sure this book is interesting to read now given the state of American politics, but that is about the best I can say. And why the love interest from the past? I am convinced that long ago some book publishing executive wrote a set of rules which dictated that all action thrillers need some kind of sub plot love story. Then one just seemed to me to be thrown in by the author to placate someone other then the author thinking it was an intricate part of the story. I did find some of the detail of the Middle East interesting and the story does have its moments of fast paced action, but overall and average effort."
1,"Indentations in bottom, defective glassware.","The large roaster had slight indentations in the sides but the main problem was the bottom next the the pyrex stamp it had a huge indentation inwards and some scratches off to one side between the corners. Packaging was dirty for lack of a better word....like they had re-boxed someones return and shipped it to me and taping was sloppy at best. I would be scared to used glass dishes with such indentations at any heat, therefore I am returning this set. Totally disappointed with the quality and packaging on this one Amazon."
5,Best animated show I've ever watched!,"Top notch animation and the stories are cinema worthy. I hear that it hasn't been renewed for a third season, which is a shame. Even if you don't like comic books, this show is definitely worth a look."
4,Worlds apart,"Taking his title of ""Agent of Chaos"" literally, Klarion the Witch Boy summons Wotan, Blackbriar Thorn, Wizard and Felix Faust to create a powerful Magic spell. The Curse splits reality creating a place for kids and adults. All seems lost until Billy Batson the young boy who is secretly the Adult hero Captain Marvel discovers that because of his dual personality he can travel between realms. He acts as a go between to unite the kids and adults on two fronts."
5,The young heroes finally get their spotlight,"So we all know Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and so many other DC heroes, but what about Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, and all of the ""sidekicks""? Yes, there was Teen Titans, but this is like the grown up version of Teen Titans. Here the ""sidekicks"" are the heroes, and they actually get to save the heroes' butts more than a few times... and the world too of course, but who's counting? At first I was a bit dubious, but after watching the entire season, I have to say that I'm not only a fan, but I'm actually hooked and can't wait for the rest of Season 2 to come out."
4,Excellent imagination builder!,"This came in plenty of time for the holidays. Great imagination builder instead of TV, movies, or video games!"
5,A Five-Star LA Noir,"I heard David Sherman speak as a member of the Mystery Writers of America's panel at the prestigious Santa Barbara Festival of Books. I'd planned to see Ray Bradbury receive a lifetime achievement award, but Mr. Bradbury arrived late. I settled for the mystery panel, and I wasn't disappointed.David Sherman spoke extensively about his on-the-spot and in-the-field research for his debut mystery, THE DARK SIDE. His research shines through in the novel. It marks the debut of Jack Murphy, an LA detective of today. The plotline involves Murphy being hired to find a missing teenager. Complications arise, and Murphy struggles both to find the girl and himself. The book features believable villians and fascinating secondary characters. This work represents the best of noir fiction being written today."
1,"This should be titled ""Synopsis of the Jolson Story w/photos","This gives woefully little information about the HUA witchhunt and how it impacted on the life and career of Larry Parks. (Read Betty Garrett's bio for that information.) This is a moment by moment synopsis with photos of The Jolson Story and Jolson Sings Again"" with some biographical information on the performers. I love both movies and could have written the synopsis myself. I wanted to learn more about Larry Parks and the disgraceful blacklist period. Also, this is a very short book (minus photos) and is more like a term paper than a serious discussion on the title's topic."
5,what a wonderful read,"I thought I was the only one that loved ""Jolson Story"" and ""Jolson sings again."" I remember as a child staying up for the late movies to watch and sign along with these movies. I was so interested in the detail about how these movies weremade. thank you Doug for writing this book."
5,The Jolson Stories I and II will always stand alone at the top.,"I have spent a lot of time in libraries and have studied theatre extensively, but have not seen thetime spent and the extensive examination of a movieas is done in this publication. I believe it is wellworth the effort as these two movies stand alone asthe best bio pics to date. True, today's fascinationwith all things computerized, etc. tend to make it seemdated. However, if you set it in the time it was madeand the reception it received, you can peel back thegimmicks and see it for the movie it is about the man who is probably and always will be the world's greatestentertainer."
3,Not a big suit,"I'm a big David Byrne fan from Stop Making Sense days, so I thought that this book of images would be deeper and richer than it is. Not really impressed with his doodles. Still a fan, though."
4,like the Rosetta Stone,"Arboretum is a key to understanding the way a very thoughtful man has never stopped making sense. It is probably most accessible to other baby boomers who share Byrne's context. We were the first generation to attend college en masse, and rock music has always galvanized our perception. Someday it will be the text for a deconstruction of our time."
4,Not bad,"Volume 3 of Miller's Daredevil saga is not as great as the first two, but it's still better than most comic books. Both the stories and the artwork are pretty good, and if you are into ninjas, then you're in for a treat. Good solid action which contains a nice mix of drama, suspense, superheroics and the occult. Not bad, not bad at all."
5,Dress Up an Old Dish with a New Sauce,"This little book is better than many more famous ones. The Clinton Presidential Cookbook has nothing on ""Sauce."" Thumb through it! Choose a recipe to dress up one of the tired old things you've been doing for dinner for years!---------------Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, award-winning author of THIS IS THE PLACE and HARKENING. Her THE FRUGAL BOOK PROMOTER: HOW TO DO WHAT YOUR PUBLISHER WON'T will be available on Amazon in September."
3,Blood and the Bomb,"I have only read about 100 pages or less (I'm reading it on my Kindle, so I can't tell exactly what page). I thought the introduction had some implied evil by American soldiers (in Grenada and Panama) which I didn't appreciate, seeming to imply that we were just as bad as the Japanese, which is something that might be discussed, but not in a history book. Now I am reading about the sad destruction of the giant battleship Yamato. I haven't read the whole book and I may change my mind, but this seems like more of an anti-war book rather than a history."
3,"a generally fine, if too scattered, account of the Battle of Okinawa","This seemed generally a fine retelling of the Battle of Okinawa, with direct personal references (albeit often to other works), that gives a good feel for how difficult that battle was and why the atomic bomb was necessary. However, it spends too much time on the Japanese and Okinawan perspective and arguing over others' perspectives on the war and the bomb. If you are looking for a straightforward account of the fight, there are better books (including those cited in this one) and you will be frustrated by the numerous and lengthy digressions. This is more of interest to those who are interested in the broader perspective of the battle and the end of the war against Japan, as well as a discussion of others' depiction of the battle and war (which I was not). Other than that it was fairly well written and organized enough to fairly easy skip over the digressions. The kindle version was well done."
1,"This book is not about Military History, it's social commentary","Much to my disappointment this book was not about the history of the battle for Okinawa, rather it tries to rationalize the Japanese atrocities and suicidal attacks. My father is a veteran of this battle and this book is insulting to him and other World War II veterans. Proffessor Feifer nees to confine his opinions to his radical college campus.Major Jim Pearson"
3,Very detailed,I found this book bogging me down with extreme detail on fauna & history instead of detailed info re the actual journey. I would like to have more info on the actual paddle conditions every day. Jennifer is very knowledgeable or well read on history & fauna.
4,Jennifer-and-the-Sea,"Adventurer, naturalist and narrator, Hahn takes the reader along through the spectacular scenery of a fabled coastline. Often pristine and wild, sometimes developed or abused, always interesting, sometimes scary. This is not another machismo assault of man-against-the-elements, this is Jennifer-and-the-sea. And she knows the sea well. This book is a good read. Inspirational and informative; enjoyable for knowledge gained (filling the plate at the ""intertidal table"") and emotions evoked (""At 2 A.M. I woke to hear food bags being shredded outside my tent...""). Spirited Waters is a spirited narrative of a modern grand adventure."
5,Amazing,"Will make you want to tackle some of these left hand pieces for yourself, especially the Scriabin. Some of the etudes seem like endless excercises, but many artful moments on this CD. You won't believe he's only playing with one hand!"
2,false advertising,"I've been dancing the 6 count swing (east coast) for 7 months, lessons once a week for an hour, plus dancing at a local jitterbug club once a week. I bought this dvd based on the advertisement of advance swing. none to be found, unless the authors call the beginning of west coast as advance swing. i learned more moves from the live dancing than from the instructors. save your money and buy something else."
1,Do NOT Confuse This Title,"I am a dance instructor for Work That Skirt. The video being sold here under the title ""Learn How to Swing Dance! Work That Skirt in Street Swing"" Is NOT the video that is being sold. I have seen this video that you are reviewing and it is horrible. The actual title Learn How to Swing Dance! Work That Skirt in Street Swing is ""out of print"" but I do have copies available. Do NOT purchase this title your are looking at now!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I had hoped to learn some advanced moves, as advertised on the cover, but this wasn't the case. It was incredibly boring, incredibly slow, and so not worth my time, or YOURS as a matter of fact. Keep searching elsewhere..."
3,Discovered less than what I expected,"I chose this instructional DVD because I wanted the ""Advanced Program"" advertised on the jacket. When I played the DVD there was no ""Advanced Program"" included. I had hoped to learn the Lindy Hop, but the steps taught are all feet on the ground, none in the air. I'm still searching for that video."
5,Excellent for beginner,"Kyle and Susan Webb are the best Swing (Jitterbug, East Coast, West Coast) instructors I have found on video. They slowly and carefully explain the steps. Some students may find this pace too slow but I find it very helpful as I am not a quick learner.By the way, the dancers pictured on the cover are not Kyle and Susan Webb."
4,"Yeah, It's Good",Great film. Fine performance from Radha Mitchell. Breath-taking scenery and a good script. If you like this sort of film you won't be disappointed.
3,its just a good old fashioned maneater film,this movie is good not great but def not bad for the budget spent on it it df made a huge profit but anyway this movie is kind of slow in the beginning haha no surprise since its made by the guy who made that horrible movie wolf creek but anyway the second half the movie is good i just wish the death scenes were more graphic cuase u dont really even c the croc till the end
1,deceptive and lame,"This is not a horror movie and there is very little action. It is a suspense story that could be shown on prime-time TV though it does not deserve it. Most of the time is spent showing the expressions of people who are scared that something will happen but the good news (for them) is that it almost never does. To put ""UNRATED"" on the DVD package, suggesting that it is somehow horrific or too much to show under usual ratings, is outright dishonest. Do not waste your money."
3,This was a good film...,"This was entertaining with pretty good special effects, but I could have easily seen this on the SciFi channel. Certainly not going to have a huge impact on the genre."
4,Dont pass up this one.....,"When i saw some of the actors, i said to myself...gee they look likeregular tourists, very normal. By having actors/actresses looking andbehaving like normal people on a boat cruise....when the action startsone could relate more to the situations... Also when you look at theextras you can see that they did their homework on crocodile research inwhich shows troughout the movie and its quality. Good entertainment aftera long day at work."
3,okay,"okay, almost like your old time Jaws movie. Buy at your own taste. Also, shipment was very quick with out paying extra money for shipment."
3,curious,I thought this was a good movie - for what it was. I just have one question - can't crocodiles hunt on land? They're not fish.
4,much better than lake placid 2... much... much... better...,"directed by the guy that did wolf creek - a well shot snoozefest rogue is about a bunch of tourists on a cruise through kakadu national park in the australian outback. the tour takes a detour when one of the passangers spots some emergency flairs just as they reach the end of the tour. much to dismay of several of the passengers, they decide to investigate. moments later, the sweet tour pontoon is attacked by a gigantic rogue crocodile. oh crikey (!!!) the gaggle-o-s.o.l.-tourists make it to a tiny mud island (think, room for 10) but need to escape before the ever-rising tide forces them in to the water with the monster croc.well shot. decent story. above average acting. sparsly used gore, which makes it much more effective. the cgi is top notch as well.... especially for a movie that had a very limited theatrical release. overall, highly entertaining."
4,Rogue,I enjoyed this movie a lot. Good cast...lots of action...and lots of gore. Not for the weak of heart...it has some scary scenes...but if you don't take them seriously...u will enjoy the movie!
4,Rogue Reviewed.,A real close look at what an enormous crocodile can do. They are ruthless and horrifyingly fast and vicious. Was probably my second best crocodile film. It will keep you on the edge of your seat most of the time. If you love this kind of stuff; buy it you won't regret it. I give it 2 thumbs up.
4,Rogue,"Being a huge fan of Creature Features, especially giant Croc and Gator flicks, I was not disappointed with this one. It starts a little slow, but builds to a tension filled climax. Good solid acting and beautiful scenery of the Australian Outback. Great special effects with the Croc. Very realistic. I highly recommend it to all fans of this movie genre."
5,What a load of CROC!!!!!!!,This is a great B horror movie all the way from start to finish. The slow build up is good with intense acting as well. Character development is given attention also. The monster croc is a real beast to behold and did anyone mention the fine musical score for a cheapie horror film??? Really-this one is a keeper. Will buy this one. Crocs 1 Humans 0
3,It seems that fast and cheap wide zoom is still a pipe dream,"I was excited about this lens when I saw all these reviews that seemed to suggest that it was the holy grail of walkaround lenses: fast, has a super-broad zoom range and is under $500. But when I got it, I was immediately underwhelmed. It is very soft at 17mm and at 70mm, with the only good focus away from the extremes. I shot RAW on my 40D and had to sharpen way too much to get a decent shot out of this lens and then it would just pick up the really bad chromatic aberrations when shooting 17mm. I sent it back and am getting the Tamron 17-50 since I have lost hope that I can get good focus and tons of zoom thanks to this lens."
1,Disappointing - tried two - both bad,"I had read several positive reviews of this lens, and it looked to be a very good fit for my needs. I purchased one and when I tested it, I found it to be very blurry on the right side at 70mm (large aperatures esp.). I exchanged it for a second copy. This one was blurry on the left at 50mm. I returned it. I am now going to try the new Tamron 17-50 F2.8. Not sure how that will perform, but I have given up on this lens.If you buy this lens, be sure to test it before your return period is over. You should test every lens you buy...there are apparently more bad copies made than good copies of many popular lenses."
2,Good lens if you can find good copy,I had to go through 4 copies to find the one I was satisfied with. First 2 were not sharp on the right side of the frame at 70mm while focused at infinity. Third was soft at 50mm across the whole frame
4,Nice lens - if you can get a good one.,"I went through two of this lens to get a good one. The zoom range is perfect for a walk-around lens. Would be nice if the tele end is a bit longer, but then image quality would be compromised. Build quality is very good - feels solid and heavy. Zoom ring rotates smoothly. It produces colors so accurate that I almost don't have to adjust color tones in post processing. Sometimes it can misfocus for no reason. I'm not crazy about the 'velvet' finish on Sigma lenses and prefer a 'traditional' black finish, but it looks ok and keeps surfaces clean. 72mm front end (along with the included petal lens hood) may look a bit intimidating for the small size of the lens. In general, good job by Sigma."
5,Great lens for the money!,"Read lots of reviews before I decided to purchase this lens. I am happy I chose it. It is a very sharp high quality lens. Fast focus, good build. Nice feel. Most important, excellent sharpness, great look, contrast. I would definately recommend this lens."
5,I really like this lens,"I've been shooting it for about a week now. Quite sharp. The macro function, which really isn't a function but just getting close to a subject, works great. The only problem I have is the lens casting a shadow on the object when you get too close. You can pretty much focus with the lens touching whatever you're shooting. Wider shots seem pretty clear also, though I haven't fully tested it at 17mm and zoomed to check the sharpness. For the price, I think this is much better than living with the kit lens if that's all you're using."
1,VERY Disappointed! The finale music is not included...,in the same wonderful instrumental version that is heard in the movie. I HATE it when they change the music from the way it is heard in the film for the soundtrack! Doesn't Hollywood understand that people buy the soundtrack because they like the way the music sounds in the movie? Why couldn't they have added it as a bonus track at least?
3,Step up CD,Good move but the soundtrack only has a two or three good songs. I like the Step 3 soundtrack a whole lot better.
4,Great Workout Mix,"I'd been looking for a good mix of fast-paced music to work out to. From Petey Pablo's 'Show me the Money,' to Dolla's 'Feelin' myself,' the Step Up soundtrack definitely has a lot more to offer in terms of good 'upper/workout' tunes than say, Save the Last Dance or Honey. The latter two are more R&B; while Step Up's hip hop mix definitely gets you moving.Can't wait for Step Up 2's Soundtrack now..."
2,Just Nice,"Except from the very good Ciara single 'Get Up' and the Sean Paul featuring Keyshia Cole single 'Give it up to me', the rest of the album is quite good."
4,Best part of the movie,"Great soundtrack. Really dug the different mixes of hip hop with underlying orchestra tones. 99% of the times I buy soundtracks are when the movie was so mediocre I'm looking for something else to keep my attention. The acting was blah, but the dancing was fabulous. A couple of the love ballads I skip over, because I don't really appreciate high-pitched R&B men's voices, but overall, good dance music."
3,the song is a rip-off,"Its a fairly good movie with pretty good music so i bought the soundtrack. I realized when listening to it that the song ""Im'ma Shine"" by YoungbloodZ is just a rip off of ""Concerto in C Minor"" By Benedetto Marcello. This is a classical Concerto for OBOE! I was very suprised, but the string parts are EXACTLY the same..."
2,"generic review, for a generic soundtrack, for a generic movie","What the hell is it about summer and a corny movie about dancing that involves some dude who totally doesn't fit in. but threw his dancing abilities he shows everyone they're wrong about him. Every summer we have one of these ""feel good"" movies that involves a ton of dancing. The soundtrack is what I'm revewing though, where do I begin? Oh, I know, how about most of these songs don't go together. We've reached a point where ""Now that's Pop"" cd's are huge sellers. I'm not saying these songs are bad (some are, some aren't) but most don't really fit. Random good songs make for a pretty bad soundtrack. There is no flow here, it's too all over the place for me. The Sean Paul & Keyisha Kole song is pretty smooth, as are a few others. As a soundtrack it doesn't work though."
1,Overhyped,"I'm not feeling this soundtrack. It's everything that I hate about modern music: all style and no substance, too many heavy beats and not enough melody, too much pop and not enough genuine soul. I could go on and on. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Nothing memorable here."
1,Simply put....This CD is extremely dissapointing,"I have seen Bad Livers live and have heard almost all of their CD's and for the most part enjoy (...) them. Without going into a long explanation as to why not to by this CD I will just say that it really [is bad]. Sorry, but it is true. Itty Bitty Town is about the only redeeming song on this CD. I can only hope that this is not a trend....."
5,"genre bending (and just plain bent, too)","Blood and Mood is wacky, funny, musically engaging, and, above all, audacious. With it's tongue-in-cheek blend of hill billy and punk rock, this is a CD that made me laugh out loud on the first listen. Blood and Mood offers a wide pallet of music, from tender ballads (&#65533;Little Bitty Town,&#65533;) to flat-out punk rock material (complete with bandleader Danny Barnes&#65533; ever-present banjo picking and high, nasally Texan singing). Of particular note is the Bill Frisell (jazz guitarist) influence in the guitar chord voicings of ""Little Bitty Town."" (Frisell and Barnes have been working together a lot lately.) This is a CD that will probably fall, unlistened, through the cracks between alternative rock and traditional acoustic music, but I love it. Five stars."
1,ketchup and ice cream,"I like all kinds of music but this just sucks. I think most fans of bluegrass,country or roots music will not enjoy this.If you don't like rap, hiphop, or dance music that's just a computer repeating the same annoying loop over and over.Then don't make the mistake of buying this peace of garbage. Like I said I like all kinds of music but when you program or talk (rap) and not sing you are not a musician but an artist, a b.s. artist, you had an idea but no talent or drive to learn to play an instument. I'm now going to take a hammer and smash this turd of a cd so it can not be resold to any other poor soul.Ketchup and ice cream two things that do not good together."
5,GREAT MADE IN USA PRODUCT,"Well made fit and finish is very good, and functions very good also. Have a more expensive dual action as well, but for model painting I find this one more convenient."
4,Coal Miners Daughter,"This is a great album. Anyone who enjoyed the movie, or is a Loretta Lynn fan should definetly have a copy. Ms. Spacek certainly has Loretta Lynn down. I especially enjoyed the duet with ""Loretta & Patsy."""
2,Damaged CD,"The last song on the CD skips, it must be damaged. The song Coal miner's daughter was a favorite and part of why I bought the CD."
3,Does the job,"I guess I was expecting too much of this product... It does the job, but the only downside is that it drips. I would have preferred spending a little more for a non dripping baster."
4,Happy with the baster,"I actually use the baster for car maintenance--pippetting the brake fluid or steering fluid.I like the glass because it won't have any interaction with the chemicals, especially the brake cleaner that I used to clean the baster with.With plastic baster (which I had one for $2), it will react with the brake cleaner, turning the plastic into a white haze.Another nice thing about this baster is that when the bulb is fully pressed, the fluid will not get into the bulb.When in use, the baster will drip one or two in the beginning, but after that it will hold the liquid pretty good.Overall, I'm happy with this baster."
5,Simply Perfect,"This baster is perfect. It is glass so it doesn't stain, and it is VERY easy to clean. I just pop it in the dishwasher. The price was great too. I use it for all kinds of things, oil, maple syrup, and o yeah, basting!"
3,Works,"Better than most stores have in stock, a little easy to break if your not careful. I wold buy this product again."
4,Automotive (R18/2007 Honda Civic Ex Coupe),"I used the Norpro Glass Baster to Siphon out power steering fluid from the reservoir. The diameter was just a perfect fit. It did the job. However, I did notice that the bulb would slide around. I'm not sure if thats common with basters as this is the first baster I have ever owned period. All in all I am satisfied with my purchase."
5,Super nice,"I wanted to get away from a plastic baster. So I picked this one. It is nicely made, durable and overall a great baster."
3,Delicate glass,Started to crack after about the 5th usage with hot liquids. Not borosilicate glass so it will wear over time
2,Doesn't hold liquids,Just makes a mess when your trying to transfer liquids with it.one two three four five six ...more words.
1,Fat Bald Dissappointment,"I don't understand how people think this book is any good. I really really wanted to like it. I thought the characters were just horrid cartoons and Addie's sarcastic comments completely inane. Also, how could anyone identify with Addie, who to me just seemed like a horrible person with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Mean spirit does not equal funny. Other writers with biting wit like David Sedaris manage to bring some human-ness to their criticism. If I met someone like Addie, I would absolutely hate her.I will admit that the pace picks up after the middle of the book, but the plot she and Jeff concoct just didn't provide any satisfaction.I bought this book after reading one of Stella's short stories and really thought this would be similar to the new Brit commedy, ""The Office."" Instead, the language and pace of the book was just extremely painful. We need to expect more from writers."
3,It could have been so much better...,"Maybe I was expecting too much from this book being a stellar slacker myslef, but I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed. Addie, a very disgruntled employee working in a cube farm office with no friends is Fat Bald Jeff's main character. The story details her bond with another disgruntled employee, the aptly named Fat Bald Jeff, and how through their misadventures they take down their company. This could have been SO FUNNY and there were rare glimpses that WERE funny, but they were very few and far between. Even though there were moments when Addie reminded me of a modern female Ignatius Reilly, my favorite literary character ever, and these moments did ellicit a chuckle, most of the time I just didn't like the girl. I just don't think the character of Addie - or any of the characters in this book were fully developed. I think Ms. Stella has the talent to write a much better book next time around."
3,Entrenched in stereotypes,"It was an enjoyable read for a rainy weekend when I was getting bombed on a good roja. However I would hesitate to use the words brilliant or original. With the exception of Addie, the characters lacked any flesh. THis may have been the result of seeing the world through Addie's perspective and her own inability to relate to anyone outside of her own experience but the author didn't quite bring out enough of the other characters through their actions.To be fair, I'm a bit biased as I was looking for something more along the lines of Microserfs which I also found dissapointing. I'm not sure it said anything in the end."
3,A fun book to ask for...,"I lost FAT BALD JEFF while doing laundry, or so I thought. I then had to return to the laundromat and assorted other places of business to ask, ""Do you have FAT BALD JEFF?"" Though, I hoped for a witty, ""no, he's not working today,"" all I got were confused looks and grunts of ""huh?"" Later, I found that I had put it back on my bookshelf.FAT BALD JEFF was fun and entertaining in a slightly disappointing and terribly forgettable sort of way. The best part of the book is the title, and the long-awaited recognition of techies. Sadly, the main character, Addie, is drawn too broadly to be at all likable, and her eventual change of heart is too little and too late to be convincing. Nonetheless, FAT BALD JEFF is light, fun, and quirky."
1,A Review for a CD thats not Out?,"Gee.. Now how strange is it when people make a review of a Single that has not been released yet. How can anyone make a judgement of the remixes when all that has been said about them that who is doing them. All anyone has heard of this new Song is the Demo that was leaked on the net over a month ago. Now sure it says this was to be released July 18, but since it was pushed back till August. I highly doubt they have listen to the actual Import Edition of this Single. So People until this CD is said In Stock, do not listen to any of these people's Reviews."
5,what's acid-rock? it's madonna's MUSIC,"Well, to those sceptic critics, Madonna will do it over and over again. Despite pushing 20 years into her illustrious career, Madonna is and will always be the trendsetter in music and fashion. The most exciting and anticipated single of the year comes in the form of the hiphop, funk and electronica dance ditty by the name of MUSIC. Working with Mirwais, a French underground electronica guru, they turn out a Daft Punk-type song which is a different from the Madonna-Orbit collaboration. But on the new album of the same title, you will get not just the best of both worlds but more with other underground producers! Like her own song, Madonna is ready to get INTO THE GROOVE! Excellent baby!"
2,Great Premise--Difficult Read,"Civilization and its Enemies has a very interesting premise and one that seems logical and reasonable. The author, Lee Harris, maintains that when a society becomes too far removed from the struggle for its existence, a kind of amnesia sets in that erases the concept of ""the enemy"". The enemy, he says, ""is just a friend we just hadn't done enough for yet."" This is what happened in America before 9/11. He goes on to diagnose how the attitude of the enemy has evolved and how our present attitude could jeopardize our future.The problem I had with the book is that it is too cerebral-too philosophical. It is too steeped in ancient history and, while this would appeal to some, in my opinion, it is not written for the ordinary person. I ended up having to skim parts of it just to get through it. The author had a great premise but needed to bring it down to earth and make it more relevant to modern day."
3,A bit disappointing.....,"Begins with a uniquely insightful analysisof the current situation. Then spendsmuch of the book delving into Hegel andancient philosophers, with some connectionto the modern situation. But the end failsto ""close"". Perhaps Harris is leaving thesolution to the reader in true academicstyle, but I would have preferred to hearwhat he thinks we should *do* to preservecivilization against this unique enemy."
1,DON'T BUY,"The title of this book disguises the fact that it is not a scholarly work and is heavy on opinion. There are no foot notes or end notes and the Author does not support his case with any primary or secondary references.I do not recommend this book for any serious student of Military Science, Political Science or Military HistoryTerry Tucker, US Army, SGM Ret; Adjunct Professor Military Science/History"
2,A bit lopsided,"Harris makes some interesting assertions on the origins of democracy (the warrior state of Sparta, the Protestant Reformation) and the nature of the Islamic conflict with the West. What I found rather astonishing though was his unwillingness to turn the ""fantasy ideology"" lense on our own leadership (GWB and friends). Fundamentalism is the real enemy..."
1,Misguided Nonsense,"History is replete with empires who thought that they had all the answers, that their view of the world is the only one that mattered, that their narrative was the only one to which all of ""civilization"" should subscribe. In trying to impose their ""truths"" on everybody else, all they succeeded in doing was causing death and suffering for many. And their view was eventually defeated and gave way to another myth. Those who believe in the end of history are as stark raving mad as all the misguided fools who led their empires to ruin. The tragedy now is that modern technology has made weapons so destructive that the coming battles that will inevitably be fought if we go down the insane path heralded by Harris will cause suffering and death on a scale heretofore unseen, and the possible extinction of mankind from the planet. The book that needs to be written is ""Homo Sapiens and its Enemies."" Harris and and his fool ideas could be a prime exhibit."
5,Quality and Speed,"This video card was an excellent upgrade to my computer. It has greatly increased the quality and speed of the graphics on my computer, especially when it comes to gaming. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good PCI Video Card."
4,only 1 flaw,"Well The RADEON 9250 is an all around great card. I have been able to play Call of Duty 2, AOE3 and other newer games but the game i'v been having problems with is BF2. it seems that the card isin't compatible with the game. so id just keep that into consideration."
2,Is The Fast Shipping Worth It?,"Arrived within 3 days. Very nice to be free shipping. Installed it into my computer, had a few problems with it I had to fix. Went from 7 frames per second to 13 on World of Warcraft at the lowest graphics. Driver disc did not work, had to find another one of those as well. I have tried the disc and graphics card in multiple computers and still the same result. Called customer service, and they said I could not exchange or return it because I opened it. How am I supposed to know if it works without opening it? To be honest, it'd be well worth saving a little more money to upgrade past this one."
3,buggy but works,You have to work on it during the installation.Runs good after that bizarre stuff upfront.
5,Love it!,"It said it would be shipped in 10 days, I recieved it in only 2 days. Packaged perfectly. Perfect condition. Half the price of the same product found in local stores. Thanks Amazon!"
4,No problem with this,"I installed it, it was immediately recognized by my PC and works great for a reasonable cost. I have not tried this out on any of the ""latest, greatest"" games likely to be the moxt taxing on video, but on Chicken Little and other graphics intensive applications, it works fine."
1,Don't do it!!!! Don't buy it!!!,"Oh my God what a nightmare!!! Nothing but problems with this thing. Half the time my computer wouldn't even start. It was so bad that sometimes after locking up it wouldn't start unless I unplugged it. Then when I actually got to the point where you load the software that screwed up too. It would say that the drivers had loaded and to restart my computer. But, when I did restart it, I got a messsage stating that the ATI program couldn't start because the drivers hadn't been loaded. This went on over and over until I gave up and yanked the card out for good. If you are really into misery go ahead and buy this product."
1,how dare they,"i have a dell dimmension 3000, and i am very angered that i have a computer that is 1 year and 2 months old and it won't !ever! run windows vista, wanna know why, because dell decided to be ultra cheap and was the only company to not include an agp or pcie slot. thanks! there are no pci cards that are vista compatible. this also means that when dx10 flight sim x comes out i cannot run it. also the sound card i got this christmas has been discontinued, meaning that drivers for it as well will not be released on vista. hello, if i bought a video card 4 months ago and a soundcard less then a month ago, vista comes out in 8 days, it better be.this is a pci card, i bought it 4 months ago, it is not compatible. how dare they still be selling cards that are not compatible with an operating system 8 days before a release. why why why!!!!!!!???!?!?!?!?!"
2,Lots of fluff and filler,"The modest amount of solid, useful information contained in this book can be gleaned almost entirely from the well written reviews on this site. The actual book itself is full of fluff--mostly about such poorly defined concepts as ""stress"" and ""supernutrition"" and ""excercise, the best medicine."" I disliked the poor organization, the repetition, the overall childishness of the writing (it reminded me of a Richard Simmons infomercial). The author did interview (by mail) people with IBD, but the sampling was small and the conclusions he draws from these comments are dubious (I've never had problems with chocolate, and I've never had a flare-up set off by stress either. Sometimes flare-ups have their own mysterious logic) . The book, published almost 10 years ago, is also badly out of date as to medication (it doesn't even mention mesalamine, now the front-line treatment for these diseases)."
4,A great self-help guide for IBS sufferers,"Although this book does not focus on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) exclusively, this is an excellent book for IBS sufferers to start with when trying to ease their symptoms through dietary restrictions. Not only does ""Eating Right"" give a fairly thorough list of possible ""trigger"" foods, but it also includes an important chapter on how to supplement a restricted diet with vitamins. Whenever I have a question on what I should or possibly should not eat, I take a look at ""Eating Right"" to create a baseline. It's a book that can be used over and over again as a reference. It's definitely worth it."
2,One of the worst of the series,"I've read most of the Love Stories books and this isn't one of the better ones. It was heavy handed and lacked interesting dialogue and character development. If you want to read the best from this series, I strongly recommend you read I Do by Elizabeth Chandler."
3,"Interesting music, but not for an Italian wedding","I purchased this CD because it was billed as ""Italian Wedding Music"" on a popular Italian American website. While the selections were very interesting from a historical viewpoint, this was definitely NOT the CD to play for an Italian American wedding reception! Fortunately, I was able to purchase another Italian Wedding CD from amazon.com that definitely filled the bill. Just wanted to advise potential brides that, while this CD may be great for a background dinner reception or other background music need, it is definitely NOT for the DJ at your Italian wedding."
4,Frank's Sister,Its really an excellent pop CD. Its got thoughtful lyrics and a very wide range of sounds. The women's voices sound great harmonized together. Alot of catchy tunes.. plus some very poignant softer numbers..I like this CD alot. I cant believe these guys are relatively unknown.... for now.
4,Solid early Jon Pertwee story,"It's a bit on the long side at 7 parts. But overall, quite the Bondian Doctor Who. Action and stunts galore, OK some are a little cheesy but this is impressive on a DW budget. The aliens aren't even the bad guys really, it's humans who are the real villains. The new color isn't the best, looks very grainy and painted on in some parts. Some parts had the original broadcast color so the quality switches from fine to slightly annoying. Definitely a story from a season that was taking the show in more of an adult direction, one that would be brought back to a more kid friendly level the following season."
5,suspenseful native american story,"This is a great scary, what's going to happen next story about things going wrong with the cop on the reservation and all the people there. Way too short...didn't want it to ever end..Hopefully, Lila will write another book soon. Both her books are well worth reading..I don't scare easily, but some things in this book made me look over my shoulder when I'm near the beaches..I highly recommend this book..."
1,no manufactured date on the page.,Most of the carseat do NOT have manufactured date on carseat information page. Carseats can be too old to purchase.
2,Product is great but customer service is horrendous,"I ordered this item almost two months ago and have not received it. I owned a Britax already so no problem with the product itself. It is the service by Amazon that is less than unsatisfactory. While their website may say that their product(s) is in stock, it is actually not. I got an email almost everyday telling me the product is on backorder and will be delayed. When I contacted Customer Service, I get nowhere because there is nothing they can do. Even their computer system says the item is in stock. On several occassions, I was promised a follow-up by phone or email but no one has contacted me to let me know what's going on. All I get is an email telling me that I need to approve a new shipping date. I am very disappointed that such a prominent online business treat their customer like this. Unless you plan on taking the chance to wait for your product, I suggest shopping somewhere else even if you have to spend a little more."
1,Looks good and that is it!,"How many problems do I need to have? Sure I wanted the Britax it looks good and it is THE car seat to have.The tether is sooo hard to adjust and has been they dont care and then all the sudden i get a recall notice in the mail....for the exact problem.Then the top clips just wont clip anymore?????????After 40 MINUTES waiting they tell me that makes no difference in the safety and some people actually take it off? Was she serious. I told her ""Ma'am I highly doubt there are many parents out there TAKING off clips from their car seat."" Whatever the clip is being sent UPS ground it will be here in 7-10 days...until then she assured me it was safe. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever. I purchased a double jogger 2 years ago and it has had a few problems...brand new one fedexed out to me but a problem with a car seat? I won't be buying anymore Britax items and I suggest nobody else does either."
3,Can be better...,"This car seat is nice and sturdy. Easy to put together and install. But the buckles don't click properly. We sent the buckle back to Britax and they sent us another one immediately (customer service is great), but we still find a problem with the buckle. Also, it's so difficult to tighten the belts."
2,Go with a different Britax Seat,"I had this seat for about 2.5 years. At first, I loved it. Then the straps started getting harder and harder to adjust. It would take both my husband and I pulling on it to get them to budge and even then we could not get them tight enough to really be considered safe. I called Britax (they have the best customer service), I explained my situation and they agreed to replace my seat free of charge with either a Marathon or Boulvard. I chose the Boulevard and I am so happy that I did. It is a fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that anyone looking at this seat consider the Boulevard instead. It is only slightly more expensive but it is much nicer. I also have the Regent which is another fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that seat to anyone with room in their car (because it is huge) and with a child over the age of 1 - it is forward facing only. Britax is the best but unfortunately there is a design flaw in this seat in the way that the buckle is made."
4,"Great carseat, but I prefer the marathon","We bought the Decathlon as our main carseat, and a few months later needed another carseat and purchased the Marathon. The padding in the Decathlon is nice especially for the smaller infant. I love both carseats but find the harness tightening mechanism much easier on the Marathon. The button mechanism just isn't as easy on the Decathlon.The Decathlon requires an amazing amount of strength and several pulls to get the harness secure around my child. Also the straps are supposed to be non-tangling but I find that every time I put my child in the seat I have to untwist the straps and follow the strap all the way around to ensure it isn't twisted. For some reason my Marathon straps never twist and the harness mechanism is much much easier.The Marathon has replaced the Decathlon as our main carseat."
5,"Just ordered a second one, we LOVE this car seat!","I bought this car seat when my son was 3 1/2 months old. He was growing too long for his infant seat. He is now 2 and still fits very comfortably. When I had my daughter I just assumed I would buy my son a booster seat and use this one for her, but my son still fits so nicely and this car seat is so safe we decided to just order another one for her. :)I am excited to have the girly colors this time around too!"
3,"LazyBoy carseat, but straps twist badly","I bought one to use as rear facing for my 6 mo old & was so impressed with how easy it is to install, I bought another for my 2 year old. The straps do twist badly & the seat is so soft that it is bulky- making it harder to find every twist in the strap. Also, these seats are HUGE. I drive a Crown Victoria & there is no room for a middle passenger in the backseat. I often bump the kids' head when getting them out of the carseat. That being said, my 2 year old LOVES being able to see out her window. She is 25lbs & very short, but could easily enjoy Christmas lights this year! All in all it's a super comfy seat & they no longer fuss like they did with the Cosco. However, it is very annoying that the straps twist so badly."
2,Good seat but not for infants,"No doubt this is a great seat, but it isn't made for infants, no matter what the description says. Even in its most inclined position, it isn't comfortable, legs are at a 90 degrees angle which is horrible for a newborn, and the baby's head is never well supported.Better buy a Maxi Cosi or an other infant seat !"
1,reversed hold-down straps,"We got two Britax car seats for both our cars. One car seat went in quickly, about 30 minutes. The second seat was a mess. The hold down straps were reversed. It took a little while to figure this out, but the left side strap was on the right side and the right strap was on the left side. The only way we were able to figure this out was because we had another seat to compare to. In my opinion, this is a major flaw in quality control and would have been an easy catch on the assembly line, IF SOMEONE WAS PAYING ATTENTION. I don't know how many other straps are out there that are reversed, but if we didn't swap them, I would have had to twist the straps to make it latch. This would make it difficult or impossible to tighten snug. We bought our seats because they were highly rated in Consumer Reports, but based off of our personal experience, half of the seats out there could be defective."
4,Best solar light I have found:,"This product has the brightest light of any of the solar lights I have bought; it does a really good job of highlighting my plants; I bought 2 white lights and 2 green lights, and would have gotten more if they had been available."
2,Less is NOT better!,"If this is the reason SMILING PHASES, Traffic's previous 2-disc retrospective, was taken off the market, that was a bad, bad, BAD move! Using this as a barometer, you'd never know that Traffic's 1974 album, WHEN THE EAGLE FLIES, even existed, and that had some primo music that should've made it here! If Island had to do another best-of, why couldn't it have been of Traffic material that DIDN'T make it onto SMILING PHASES? This CD is a functional intro to Traffic at best, but that's about it."
4,"Good, but not complete","About ten years ago, Traffic released a double disk anthology album entitled ""Smiling Phases"" that contained just about every great Traffic song, 26 of 'em in all. Compared to that collection, this one is good, but sorely deficient. ""Medicated Goo,"" ""Vagabon Virgin,"" ""40,000 Headmen"" and ""Walking in the Wind"" are just some of the classics this collection is missing. Apparently, ""Smiling Phases"" is out of print, but I would strongly suggest searching for a used copy. It is close to being the perfect anthology album."
1,"Good, but why buy this when there is Smiling Phases!?!?!?","For a penny less, you can get every song on ""Feelin's Alright"" AND ELEVEN MORE SONGS from the compilation Smiling Phases. Sure, this one disc compilation contains *great music* but what shmoe would buy it when you can get more music on 2-CDs for less money???? Perhaps another reviewer can fill me in on the ""logic"" of buying this over Smiling Phases because I don't see it.EDIT - Sept 07 -Not sure how often Amazon fiddles with prices, but today at least, ""Feeling Alright"" is almost 10 dollars while ""Smiling Phases"" is almost 17. Those prices are more in line with the number of songs on each disc. And if ""Feelin Alright"" truly does have a noticeably better sound due to remastering, it might even be the better deal right now."
2,Don't Bother With This if You Already Have Low Spark,"I am so glad that I got this as a free selection to a music club recently! I'm listening to the 13th song on this terrible cd( John Barleycorn must die), awaiting Rock 'N' Stew and Low Spark of High Heel Boys. I own that cd and know they will be the highlights of this junky disc. Thank Goodness a local cd store purchases used cd's because that is where this will be going very soon. The only reason I didn't rate this lower was the last 2 songs on the disc. I thought this might be as good as low spark ( which I rated 4 stars) but It isn't even close. Don't bother with this if your only a casual fan as I am."
3,Traffic Lite,"Over-weighted in ""Barleycorn"" tracks, skipping over entire albums, missing essential Traffic tunes, this album attempts - and fails - to do the impossible; placing all of Traffic's ""phases"" on one disc, as two individual collections would have been handily appropriate to summarize the recently remastered catalog. However, if, after gauging the track listing, this is still your idea of a good time, then by all means, go play in the Traffic."
5,Do you like 60's Psychadelia?,"If so, add this to your record collection. Whether it's the out-and-out strangeness of Hole in My Shoe, the bleankness of Dear Mr. Fantasy, the mysterious Freedom Rider or the philosophic Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys, Feelin' Alright has range. Highlights include Hole In My Shoe, Dear Mr. Fantasy, Feelin' Alright?, Freedom Rider, Rock 'n' Roll Stew, Pearly Queen, and Low Spark, though every song here is great. It's a must-by for any classic rock fan. Of course, John Barleycorn and the self-titled release are still must-haves."
4,"Feelin' Alright, alright",It's a CD with a lot of the group's classics and the sound quality is OK. It is a definate mood brightener!
5,"""talent & performance is ultimate Traffic""","This album is the perfect blend of rock with a group of talented musicians. Remastering is the high point of this CD, not only is the content wonderful, but the way it was presented is awesome.As usual there are some stand outs - ""DEAR MR. FANTASY"" - ""HEAVEN IS IN YOUR MIND"" - ""PAPER SUN"" and ""FORTY THOUSAND HEADMEN captures the mood of this group, which is truly timeless.These recordings represent ""THE VERY BEST OF TRAFFIC"", and after sampling you too will be ""FEELIN' ALRIGHT""!Total Time: 77:23 on 15 Tracks/ Island Records Ltd - 314 542 272 2 (2000)"
5,Hit the trail with Wylie,If you like great singin and playin you will really like this CD. Some of the finest western music anywhere!
5,These Guys Are the Real Deal,"I always thought that the modern purveyors of cowboy music began and ended with Riders In the Sky, and then I got introduced to Wylie (Gustafson) & The Wild West. These guys are the real deal! [In fact, Ranger Doug duets with Wylie on ""Sage and Sand""--which they co-wrote.] And these are mostly originals. The only other non-original is their playful take on the traditional ""Buffalo Gals."" If you draw a straight line from Gene Autry to Roy Rogers to Riders In the Sky, it will lead directly to Wylie & the Wild West. They respect the tradition without resorting to being campy. Yee-Haw! [Running Time - 42:07] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,Good but not great,"Interesting music, but far from the virtuosa magic of Clara Rockmore's ""The Art of the Theremin""."
3,Good Overall,"Miss Kavina is a very talented thereminist, certainly up there with the likes of Clara Rockmore and Samuel J. Hoffman.Nevertheless her choices in repertoire for this CD are mostly forgettable. Free Music #1 for four theremins (1936) was no doubt very avant garde at the time, but it's no more listenable now than then.Also the timbre of her instrument in most of the pieces varies from overtone-less sinewave to drinking-straw nasal buzz, with nothing pleasant in between. Absent are the sweet, second-harmonic and pitch/time-variant harmonics that make Rockmore's ancient thermionic custom machine so nice to listen to.But nevertheless Miss Kavina is to be applauded for helping keep the theremin visible in the electronic music field, with her emphasis on live performance and traditional musicianship, rebuffing the studioism and MIDI-ization of the last three decades.Definitely a worthy addition to all theremin enthusiasts' CD shelves."
2,Not the Whole Story,"While I'm a fan of the Biography Channel and their ensuing DVDs, I'd hoped for a more realistic presentation of Whoopi Goldberg's life. It glossed over many of the basic facts of her life that make her who she is. This is why I read the person's own biography on many occasions before I watch the show. In the last few years, Biography Channel has leaned a little more to presenting a more choreographed version, instead of the facts. Presenting years of the individual's life in one sentence, is not the way to go. Thank you."
5,heartbreaking,"Imagine a joyous, healthy pregnancy, a well-thought out birth plan, a normal labor, a baby who doesn't cry, who lies limp on her mother, and is raced by helicopter to a hospital with an intensive care nursery. There the nightmare becomes reality, a baby born with severe brain damage, with no identifiable cause. One week after Silvie's birth, her parents are advised to take her home to die. The doctors guessed that she would die in a few days; those days stretched into weeks, accumulated into months. Rogoff's luminous memoir details the conflicting emotions she and her husband felt as they continuously braced themselves for their baby's death. Her descriptions of living in limbo,trying to balance hope with reality, are powerful."
4,Nice calendar,"This is a nice little calendar that gives the reader a good idea about the spirit of Zen. It is especially good for those who don't know much about Zen, as it uses quotes from many non-traditional sources as well as Zen masters. I also recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold which is filled with hundreds of inspirational and profound thoughts."
3,True Zen does not come in little boxes...,"I am taking a Zen class, so you can imagine my suprise when I received this Zen daily calandar for Christmas. However, upon reading the little sayings and quotations I realized that my expectations were too high. I thought this was supposed to be a daily calandar filled with Zen wisdom and thought provoking sayings and quotes from various sources around the world.While the calandar is enjoyable, don't rely on the Zen calandar to learn very much about Zen itself..."
2,duh ??????,Half of this calender really makes no sense at all - I am sorry that I purchased it for myself and as a gift. I was hoping for a little wisdom and some calming inspiration - but most of the quotes are so far out there and unintelligible that this was a total waste of money.
5,my 2 worth,"I'm a cat lover to begin with, so this might come out sounding more than a touch biased. My first exposure to ML was Cat in a Jeweled Jumpsuit. I enthusiastically recommend it, it's got the King, it's got Las Vegas, it's a mystery and most of all it's got Midnight Louie! I have since gone on to read Catnap, Pussyfoot, Cat on a Blue Monday and Cat in a Flamingo Fedora, which is notable for the climactic abduction and forced vasectomy of our hero ML. A damn shame that, since in her debut in Cat on a Blue Monday, Louie's long-lost daughter Midnight Louise alias Caviar, revealed her lack of desire for motherhood and breeding. If only the family line could be continued! we all need more such cats as Midnight Louie, to say nothing of Temple Barr's need as well as that of Las Vegas in general. My basic point, do yourself a big favor and start collecting the ML series today!! Talk about being worth every penny. I'd gladly grab up every title myself if I ever hit the Lotto jackpot!"
1,Terrible.,Terrible. After two days it squished down flat and never sprang back. The other colors are great but not this one.
3,review,"I bought the reel cart to replace the same make and model I had. The newer one is made of thinner material, and smaller wheels, which makes it weaker and unstable. I actually removed the reel only from the newer cart, put it on my old cart, and threw the rest of the new cart away."
1,Suncast poor quality hose mobile,Suncast is still the most prevelant brand sold in many retail stores; I have bought two garden hose carriers because of their availability. The large hose mobile barrow broke with 100' foot of hose attached (well under the 225' capacity it validates). A Lowe's rep where I purchased looked on the label and said there is no warranty or I would have returned this product promptly. I've learned and I'm not making Suncast any richer!
3,exciting & dark,This score is moving-exciting and dark but there are parts especially into Rendevous that become very repetitious and loud almost to the point of being painful.My favorite parts are the Prologue-The Engagement and the end selection The Waltz. I ordered it because I had seen the movie and was captivated with the soundtrack- I could not get the music out of my head and wanted to own the CD so that when I am in the mood-I could listen.
5,"""Birth"" Soundtrack","A gorgeous symphonic score for Glazer's ""Birth."" Just like the film, the score casts a strange spell, at times whimsical and elegant and at other times moody and enigmatic. While some tracks are honestly a little repetitive and simplistic, the most note-worthy tracks are; Prologue, Rendezvous, Elegy, and The Birth Waltz. Even if your not familiar with the film itself, the scoring by Desplat has a rare classic beauty full of piano and swooning strings among other elements.4/5."
4,A moody score for a moody film,"By itself the score sounds a bit detached and moody, but if you have seen the film, you'd know how well the score helps define the film. The Philip Glass-esque soundtrack is fascinating to listen to while consuming the images on the screen. On its own, t's also a great collection for meditation."
1,NOT MADE WELL,"The first time I used them the plastic stem broke and it wasn't from abuse, but they are not made of a quality plastic. The old adage"" Spend a nickel more and get something worth it."""
2,HMMMMM??,Not that good on the eyes. They are a little out of focus and they tilt forward. Lived and learned!
2,Did not last long,"I bought these for my husband, who does a lot of yard work. He is hard on sunglasses. They usually only last up to six months. We tried these and he really liked them (price was right), but they did not last a month! So we are trying another DeWalt brand that looks sturdier and the front lens are molded in one piece and over the bridge of the nose."
4,Good Field Protection & Good Durability,"I wore a pair of the DPG52's for over a year and found them useful while working out in the field. Wore it for eye protection from the strong gusts and wind in South Texas, especially with the fact that I wear contact lenses (which wind can be an annoyance), found these to be extra helpful + they look decent on me. My company provided these to me over a year ago but no longer carry them in stock. Therefore I decided to order a new pair online after the screws on mine got rusty and broke apart. After reading the previous reviews on durability of the glasses I will order a 2 or 3 instead of one. Maybe I just got lucky with the first pair, we'll see."
1,Bonus features incomplete,"In the ""ALI'S DOZEN"" disc there is not the 4 classic figths as bonus features, there is only one, as I'm not english speaker the reason for purchase was the fights, and I only got 3 instead of 6."
5,The perfect device,"This is the ideal product to replace any device that uses this voltage, as it is slim, doesn't produce any heat, has folding blades and has the ""Sony"" plug needed to power many Sony devices.I replaced all my bulky transfos with this ""line"" of products, and never had any problem. They are even ""nice"". For a voltage adapter, that is :).The only criticism is that as it only comes with the 110v vertical blades for the plug, if you have to plug it to a 220 V plug, you have to use an adapter, that is not always safe, definitely clumsy, can always get loose, and generally makes it almost as cumbersome as having to get a 110 to 220V transfo, and then this device, for powering stuff.Anyway, summing up... Well worth the price!!"
1,Red Sox fan makes documentary,"Ken Burns likes Baseball.....Ken Burns also like the Boston Red Sox. What could have been a great documentary is tragically skewed Burn's love for all things Red Sox. His biased lens is so eager to tell the story of the Yankees/Red Sox rivalry and Boston's return to glory, that he forgets to cover in depth Baseball's other triumphant stories of the last few decades. He also fails to mention how The Red Sox got there. Roided up players and increased spending.What happened to the amazing stories of the Minnesota Twins, the Chicago White Sox and Atlanta Braves?Truly a missed opportunity."
4,Baseball's glory is in its past!,"I own the boxed Baseball set by Ken Burns, along with the Civil War and found them both wonderful. This last chapter focuses on the harsh realities of modern baseball which to me is like looking at yesterday's papers. Watching Bonds, Mcgwire and Sosa reminds me of the excitement and ultimate dissapointment of the sport. There is nothing romantic about that, the baseball strike, the steroid epidemic and the bastardization of time honored statistics. It is a chapter I will ignore in the future and stick to the original box set which is a masterpiece."
2,Every copy has a data error!,"The first copy of this I ordered had a data error in Disc 1, right around 20 minutes in. Neither the Blu-Ray player attached to my TV nor the Blu-Ray Disc software on my PC could play anything on disc 1 from about 19:30 to around 24:00 or so.I ordered a replacement copy, and it had the SAME error in EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE.The disc pressing service PBS used has serious quality control issues!"
4,"Great addition to the series, but the blu-ray disc has a playback issue","Watching this I felt this was very well done, and great addition to the series. The only problem I have is that the top of the 10th inning blu-ray disc around the 19 minute mark(the start of the Ken Griffey Jr section) the disc stops playing and then skips ahead several minutes. It seems both chapters 3 and 4 have issues on this disc with playback and chapter skipping back and forth. Once chapter 5 hits then playback is fine and there are no issues on the rest of the disc. I was able to reproduce this on a PS3 and LG BD570 blu-ray player. PBS needs to address this issue with this disc. There is another review with another customer having the same issue so it seems to be a mastering issue with the disc."
3,"East Good, West Bad","This film is good in many ways, but as a viewer living in the west, I found it to be east-coast biased. All of Bonds' achievements were a terrible stain and abomination, while the Red Sox winning the world series was glorious. But both occurred during the steroid era and perhaps neither would've taken place without steroids. I suppose Bonds' biggest sin was not donning a Red Sox or Yankees uniform; then the eastern media might have treaded more lightly upon him. The bias of the filmmakers shows through in this production."
2,A Tale of Two Cities,"Ken Burns appends his 9 part PBS masterpiece. Unfortunately, the majesty that was 150 years of baseball spread over nine discs is lost in this microscopic close-up of 20 years spread over 2 1/2 hours. To make matters worse, the constant focus on the Red Sox and Yankees that was a quibble with the original film is full-on obnoxious in this episode. If you are a fan of the Yankees, or particularly the Red Sox, you'll probably love this film. For the rest of us it seems as long and drawn out as a game between these two same teams."
2,A Tale of Two Cities,"Ken Burns appends his 9 part PBS masterpiece. Unfortunately, the majesty that was 150 years of baseball spread over nine discs is lost in this microscopic close-up of 20 years spread over 4 hours. To make matters worse, the constant focus on the Red Sox and Yankees that was a quibble with the original film is full-on obnoxious in this episode. If you are a fan of the Yankees, or particularly the Red Sox, you'll probably love this film. For the rest of us it seems as long and drawn out as a game between these two same teams."
3,Some important events of the last 15 years are not even covered,"Even if it's still a good, nice documentary about baseball, Ken Burns's 10th inning is the weakest entry of the whole ""Baseball"" series. The amazement about the game, the joy of sharing something wonderful and meaningful is just not there.Some important events of the last 15 years are not even covered, such as MLB's poor handling and fiasco of the Montreal Expos situation and the departure for Washington. I also dearly miss the former narrator...Still, 10th inning is about Baseball and it can't be all that bad."
3,Blu-ray mastering error,When the Ken Griffey Jr. chapter starts (around 19 minutes into the disc) my Panasonic BD80 and my sister's BD65 stop playing the disc. If you skip this chapter the disc plays fine. Seems to be a mastering error since other reviewers had the same problem.
3,Baseball: The 10th Inning,"GIFT GIVER: Passable. Has interesting information but not as good as innings 2 through 9. If you have the first 9 innings, you should have the 10th inning to keep your set up-to-date.A 2 disc documentary. Worth the funds to keep your set up-dated.GIFT RECEIVER REVIEW (52 years a sports writer): This program is a good follow up to the original 9 volume series which gives the view of baseball history from its inception to the EARLY 1990'S. It tells the true story of WHY baseball is, and why it still survives."
3,I was expecting more,"I'm a huge baseball fan. I couldn't wait to see The Tenth Inning and though it was interesting, it was certainly not as moving and fascinating as the first nine innings were. It just felt like another documentary about baseball. Nothing less. Nothing more. The 1994 documentary made me want to know everything about the game and its history. But with The Tenth Inning, that feeling simply wasn't there."
2,damaged disk,I bought this new; it arrived shrink wrapped and appeared to be new. However the second disk has a flaw and is unplayable. There is a large section that is rippled.
4,A great book,"Paul Zindel strikes again with another literary marvel. This book is plain fun, and it's very easy to relate to the character of Edna Shinglebox (although, thank God, my parents are nothing like hers). Marsh is a very interesting character, and the book is typical Zindel fare. It's a lot of fun, and very, very interesting. It's a very good character study."
5,An Old Friend,"I have read this book every year since 1984. I love this book. The characters are quirky, flawed, and deep. There is so much comedy and humanity in this little novel. Best young adult/teen novel ever written!"
4,Great concert!!!,"Playing only works from the second olineup, this Cd shows Gong in great form, making jazz,rock and great improvisations. Mike Oldfield sounds great in there!!!"
1,the worst mattress ever,"I feel cheated as soon as I see the product. This futon mattress looks very poor. It is extremely soft that I can feel the inner spring when lying on it. When I opened the zipper on it, I found the mattress's content was shoddy cotton mixed with smashed straws. The quality of the futon is really unaccepetable. I don't understand how such products can be sold. Don't buy it!!!"
1,No delivery,I must say that ordering online is very convenient however; when the product you paid for never shows up it's a little frustating. I ordered from price pros on 16 May and today is 30 May with no delivery. I waited online for customer support for one hour just to receive a message from the answering machine that I'm calling past business hours and I should leave a voice mail. After you leave a voice mail someone should get back to you in 24 hours. Unfortunately I have been trying to speak with someone about my order since 25 May witch was the estimated delivery date. I sent an email to customer support and received a response after three business days indicating they would check with the warehouse. Now I'm forced to purchase another mattress from a different company and I'm out of 141.00 dollars. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
3,just okay,It was a thick mattress but still has the feel of a futon mattress. Not sure I would spend the money again.
5,Great old Doctor Who episode,This is a great episode that plays into the new Doctor Who series. This is a great old Doctor Who episode that isn't available on DVD at the time of this post. This is a must see episode to understand this doctor.
3,Classic Hartnell,"While this is not the best of the Hartnell years, it stands the test of ""time"" very well (pun fully intended). One of the ""let's revisit history"" storylines, this introduces the first glimpse of another time-lord, and suggests the Doctor is part of a race instead of merely being a quirky individual. The character of the monk is quite interesting and rather funny, and the Doctor's disdain for his violation of the ""prime directive"" (to borrow from Trek) is interesting considering the directions the series would take in later years. Had this avenue been explored, the show might very well have turned out more like Quantum Leap, with the Doctor running around trying to correct mistakes throughout history. In sum: a worthy episode, but not as exciting as many others, nor as lavish in scope or atmosphere. Most of the supporting roles are rather lack-luster. Of interest mainly to those who are amassing a Hartnell years collection."
4,Surprisingly good,"Assuming you are a Dr Who fan, The Time Meddler is an entertaining adventure from the early days of the program, and well worth a look. The restoration work on the these black and white transmissions is superb, and the special features on the disk are pitched squarely at fans interested in knowing more about the work of restoration. The Time Meddler was played with humour, and was one of the earliest stories to introduce a determined effort to derail history as we know it, so it is something of a milestone in the long running saga that is Dr Who.Like most of these stories, early Dr Who episodes are going to appeal mainly to the program's fanbase, to those interested in '60s TV, to sci-fi fans, or those interested in fiction of a very British kind. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but for the Dr Who fan, this is a good one."
3,"Good premise, primitive execution","SPOILER ALERT! AFAIK, this is the first presentation of another Time Lord, although I don't recall if they call themselves Time Lords in this story. It was amusing to hear the other make fun of the Doctor's TARDIS. The story line is pretty good, but as usual in this era of Doctor Who, the presentation is very primitive. Zoe and Stephen are annoying, cloying and silly. Nor am I a fan of Hartnell's Doctor. However, this is probably one of the important stories of the Hartnell time and you shouldn't miss it."

4,Excellent resource for purchasing stock directly.,"As an individual investor, I am always looking for resources that can maximize my investments. Mr. McCulla's book provides valuable information on the little known program of purchasing stock directly from companies. The book details a step by step guide for purchasing stocks directly and has a complete list of companies that sell stock in this manner. It is an excellent resource for all investors"
1,"Oh God, please stop!","I remember when a school buddy of mine got this tape back in the 90s. Some mega-Christian relative found out the kid was into rap and slipped him this sneaky little offering. Of course, they didn't realize that the rap he had been listening to was Public Enemy, and that this tape sounded more like something from an episode of Barney. We ran through it once, giggled a little, grimaced a lot. Eventually it got to be a game. One of us would sneak the tape into his boom box, hit play, crank the volume, and then run out of room laughing while the other screamed in agony until they could get it shut off again."
5,Special French Christmas Music,This recording is a must for everyone interested in French Noel music. This very special Boys choir sings with a very rich and warm sound. It is a joy from start to end. I will enjoy this Christmas music for many years.
1,Horrible is an understatement,"This jack rinella character not only seems to have limited experience in BDSM, but his writing style and ability is not above fifth-grade level. His paragraphs are one long, ""Lost in his own self-importance"" sentence. He seems to have no idea how to use punctuation and worse, he has misspelled words throughout his self-aggrandizing, shallow, uninformative, lackluster, run on, two-sentence chapters.He seems to see himself as some sort of pimp daddy. He might be in his little mind, but he is not someone that should be taken seriously as an author let alone a dominant. Stay clear of his tripe."
4,Slow delivery but good experience,It took awhile for the item to get to me. I had it by the estimated delivery date in as much as at the very end of that timeline although I received shipping confirmation long before that. The book was in new condition as promised though and ultimately I was somewhat pleased overall. I would order from this seller again so long as I wasnt expecting the item to be delivered quickly.
4,Great book for the beginner,"I thought it would be fun to teach my italian greyhound some agility, so I picked up the entire series by Simmons Moake. She give excellent instruction on teaching your dog each obstacle, and how to properly approach and preform the obstacle the right way from the beginning. This book might not be appropriat for those with little patience (of the trainer or the dog), because she focuses of doing one obstacle till it is preformed appropriately from all directions at speed. She does not go into doing series until the next book. So, if you are just interested in having fun in the yard with your dog - this might not be the right book for you. If you could go on to competition and you and your dog want to feel confident in preforming a course I highly suggest picking up this series."
1,Save your money.,Not worth even the small price they charge for it. It just might be the worst blade I have ever purchased. Spend a little more and get a blade that is carbide tipped. I learned my lesson so you don't have to.
3,only fair,"Watching brutal battles is far more entertaining when you know that the fighters are some of the best in the world. You don't get that with this DVD. In fact, you don't get much background on the fighters at all. If you like the brutality of MMA then you'd be better off buying something else. The superfights on this DVD were fairly good but the rest were hit and miss. Overall, this was a good DVD to watch once (or to rent) but to own it may be a waste."
2,A few good ideas....,but most were kind of lame for the classroom. The activities seemed more suited for home environment of one child or very few.
5,BOREDOM BUSTERS!,There are so many things to do in this book!!!! I have found countless projects/games to keep my very energetic toddler (not yet 2) busy for hours at a time!!!!
2,Just another Repeat,"This book is just another repeat of its' author, I also bought the Toddlers Busy Book and it is basically the same thing...buy one or the other. I perfer the Toddler Busy Book over this one."
2,begging for bucks,"geez, how many times can you repackage and sell Bruce's stuff? We had the essential Bruce that you had to buy to get the bonus disc. Next we have the Seeger sessions, and now an updated version of it with some new tracks and video just a few months later. How about ""Born To Run"" ? An aniversary edition of it with a DVD of a London show in 1975. THEN a 2 disc audio Cd of the live show. Geez, if you have the DVD just record the audio portion. I know property taxes are high in Jersey but does he really need the money that bad? We're all supposed to run out and buy whatever he sells? So much of what he's been doing lately is BORING. I love Bruce and have from the beginning but enough is enough! My rule now is that if it's not with the E-Street Band it's not getting my money. Sorry if I don't share Bruce's artistic vision lately but I know I'm not the only one."
1,Milking the fans again...,"First off, let me say that I absolutely love this CD. I am, however, so tired of artists taking advantage of fans by putting out a product and then putting out a bonus CD so shortly thereafter. Enough of this practice. It is a total let-down for an artist who claims to be so connected to his fans to keep doing this."
2,Non-traditional performance style disguised as traditional music.,"Springsteen is a quasi-folk singer with poor diction that doesn't know what the meaning of traditional music is. Excuse me, but throwing in everything from the kitchen sink doesn't make the music more interesting. It only makes it weird. Nothing sits right with this album. The traditional instruments are mixed with brass instruments and a cheap drum-set that add nothing to the traditional songs of American nostalgia. Nothing needs to be added to the songs if one really appreciates traditional songs as they are traditionally sung and played. This album has tried to popularize traditional music so as to make it palatable to the general public who generally doesn't appreciate the real thing. It might make your toe tap while you listen to it, but so does any rhythm in the universe."
1,Seeger? Not Really........,"I'm a bit at odds with this work because these are not songs written by Pete Seeger. Does it not seem just a tad suspicious that Springsteen deliberately did not use a single song that was actually written by Seeger? Instead using songs ""made popular by"" Seeger to avoid paying royalty fees while freely using songs in the public domain waste bin of lapsed copyrighted material. Then, after using these lapsed songs, he went out and ascertained his own copyright for the arrangements. Therefore, if other artists would like to do these songs, they now have to pay Bruce a royalty fee! You know, for a socialist he's one heck of a capitalist by commandeering these songs for free to maximize his profits. Isn't this at odds with his own well crafted champion of the underdog image? This American Land edition is aptly titled because even though Bruce despises the American capitalist economic system of free markets, he plays it like a fiddle for his own accumulation of wealth."
1,Pay Me My Money Down,"Shame on Bruce. Who would have believed Mr. Springsteen would be gouging his fans like this? Pay me my money down alright - and again, too. Stay away from this rip-off!Like the 'Boss Fan' says in his review: ""It's only a ripoff if you buy it"". Right on man. Save your money!"
5,"Springsteen- Always Evolving, Always Interesting","First off, have to admit that I am a solid Bruce fan. First saw him in the late 70's and have seen him in every decade since. Have every album from his first one to this one, and have enjoyed all of them. So having made that clear, let me say that I really enjoyed this set. The music is fun and it seems like Springsteen is having a good time with this. It is a departure for him as it is the first album he has done that consists of songs from other musicians. This version has extra songs on it and a wonderful DVD that has a nice documentary on the making on the album and four terrific live performances. A couple of highlights from the album include ""Pay Me My Money Down"" and ""American Land."" Take a listen to this album and, long time fan or not, this is one to enjoy for everyone. The DVD and the extra songs on the CD make this a terrific buy. There are classic American songs on this album sung by a classic American singer. Really a strong performance."
4,Seeger Sessions,"Not the kid of music you would normally expect from the Boss. I listened to it a few times now. And I must say, I'm getting used to it. The tunes are quite catchy. Still I hope the next album will be a E-Street album like Born in the USA or The Rising"
3,Good CD - Live Set Better,"I originally bought the dual disc version of this CD but it would not play in my stereo so I gave it to my sister who loves it.I feel after listing to Live In Dublin that the songs on this album are works in progress.Bruce constantly calls out chord changes in the middle of the songs and there are a few mistakes from the band.This album has a raw, on the fly feel to it, like a bunch of friends have come together to pay homage to Pete Seger.This is not a bad album but I prefer the synergy of Live In Dublin better.The bonus material on the DVD is intersting but I will probably not watch it again.The extra songs on this is well worth the extra cost.I just wish they put them on the CD as well because I burn the CD and put the original away to keep it from getting damaged."
4,American Land Edition,"I only ordered this for the ""American Land"" track which is not on the original CD. It was, however, worth it."
3,Advanced Engineering Mathematics,"As a text to learn mathematics, this text is better than average. However, there are numerous errors in terms of handling real physical systems. The author clearly does not understand the words ""dimensional analysis"" when he describes ""real problems"". Futhermore, many times the author seems quite willing to change physical laws in order to simplify the mathematics. For any doubters out there, consider the 1/r (not 1/r2) electrostatic force described on page 246 problem 19. Simply stated this text is above average if you plan on learning the mathematics needed to solve engineering/physics problems. However, under no circumstances should this text be used to obtain equations for real systems."
1,Not good,"This is a terrible book. The content is too brief and most topics are not covered adequately. Perhaps the older longer editions were better? The treatment of PDE's is very brief and the book has more of an emphasis on formulas and their applications rather than explaining concepts in depth. The presentation is short and jerky and very superficial. Kreyszig or Zill are much better book. Stay away from this book, at least the seventh edition."
4,Good math text but has some mistakes in examples,"I found the book really useful to learn the material for upper levelundergraduate mathematics. I found the explanations rather straightforward and the text provides proofs, which I appreciate, but in some sections, such as power series, the example problems have small mistakes which will frustrate if you use them to help you learn the material as I do. I can see how the book's lack of depth into each individual subject could leave some lacking. The book also requires prier knowledge of basic calculus and algebraic manipulation so students without this could get lost in examples. I believe that these traits trim down the text and makes it more of a resource, which I like. Overall I think it is a decent book but it is unacceptable to me for the book's examples to have errors."
2,Not so advanced engineering mathematics,"Might be a satisfying undergrad text, but as grad textbook is not great. It tries to cover every math subject that an engineering might come across (linear algebra, PDEs and complex analysis) but by doing so it ends up covering only basics without rigorous treatment of the topic. If you are a math guy or a PhD student from any field, do not even think about buying it, if you are an engineer it might be good enough. For linear algebra I personally suggest Shilov's book, old style but rigorous and complete."
4,WORTH THE MONEY!!,The book is very well laid out for engineering students. The best feature of this book is that it contains examples that directly apply the theory. It is a great book for a first and second year graduate level courses.
2,Math book,It's outdated and I was duped into buying it. The least they could have done was provided a picture of it. Who wants the 2nd edition when there's a 7th edition out?
1,It's a worthless piece of junk,"To be honest I must let everyone know that the course I used this book for only looked at a couple of chapters, from which we had the option of buying a special excerpt package. From those sections, I can safely conclude that this textbook was the most useless textbook I've ever had to use. Every example is of only the most basic cases, which makes it impossible to solve problems that are remotely different from those shown. The only thing worse than the textbook, was trying to make sense of the professors teaching the course. I'm sure that there is a more useful textbook out there, so buy that one instead."
4,Cute outfit,"Purchased this outfit for my son's christening. It was cute and and my son was comfortable the whole ceremony. The material of the cloth was soft and comfortable. My problem was during the time you put the outfit on. They should have added more buttons or make more room around the neck . For a baby like my son who is so squirmy it was such a challenge putting it on.But overall , I'm happy with it."
4,New Taste... Leaves a Wonderful Taste,"As a cacao researcher I find this New Taste... a well-thought and provocative introduction into the natural history of cacao for the casual eater, epicurean, and even beginning researchers. The various sections and references are topical as well as thoughtfully presented. Ms. Presilla really brings you in to the mystique as well as some lighter aspects of the science behind cacao and chocolate. Many people don't realize what good chocolate really is like! Ms. Presilla even helps you to develop the skills involved in tasting and evaluating chocolates similarly as you would with fine wines. And if you can't romance that special someone after wowing them with Fran Bigelow's Deep Chocolate Torte that is simple to make and out of this world- page 136(heavy cream, eggs, 1 lb of dark chocolate), you're not really trying!"
5,One of her best albums,"Elis Regina, who died in 1982, was one of Brazil's greatest modern vocalists, and this is certainly one of her finest albums, certainly in the top three of her prolific career. It's swingin'!"
3,English arranger does not hip with Elis Regina,"I don't quite understand why this album has been recorded. Arrangements are by Peter Knight and they definitely did not work well with the Brazilian rhythm section. Unfortunately, there is a Johnny Mandel's gem ""A Time for Love"" but ...By the way, things began to get wrong from the album title: it was not really recorded in London!"
2,Blue Knight Has No Horse,"Picture shows a horse. However, it is not included with the purchase of this knight. The picture is misleading. We were surprised by this and teturned the item immediately."
2,Good only if you don't know 61131,"The examples are very limited and like most books, is not willing to provide hard and fast rules on what section of the standard should be used when. I large scale example showing a more complex operational block of logic would be helpful."
2,"time comsuming, not much learning.","The Virtual Clinical Excursions was required for my peadiatric nursing class. I would not recommend it unless it is required. It is kinda neat at first because you click on the hospital entrance, click on the elevator, click on the floor you want to go to. But it is slow to navigate. You watch a nurse practitioner do assessments and look through virtual charts. There's just not that much to learn from it."
5,"Great stand, especially for $10","I use this stand for my Seagull S6. It's perfect. For the price, there's really nothing to think about. It folds up nicely too."
4,Good for home use,I am satisfied with the stand for use at home. I have a Seagull S6 Original and the stand works well with it.
5,Excellent,"Compact enough to fit into small gig bag. Does not support from the neck the way larger stands do. Rear of guitar leans against the stands upright support. Works well with acoustics, don't know about electrics, but looks as though it'll do the job."
5,simple and great price,This mini stand was perfect because it served the purpose of holding up my husband's guitar and didn't take up too much space. Simple and great value.
4,small stand that does the job,it's a sturdy little stand that doesn't take much space and is almost invisible but does a great job of supporting the guitar
5,Nice little stand..,"This is a great little stand for our daughter's acoustic guitar. It was so easy to set up she did it herself. The tripod design keeps the guitar steady, and we have had no problems with it at all. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to display their guitar or keep the instrument in reach for practice and play."
4,Just what I needed.,"This little stand is nothing short of prefect for me. It is gentle on my guitar, and on my eyes while also being light weight and easy to fold up and take with me if need be. Well done, Fender!"
2,Save your money for a full-sized stand,"I've owned one of these for about a year and a half, and frankly wish someone had warned me off before I bought it. It's decently constructed and has held up ok, but it's inherently less stable than a full sized one. The biggest problem I have is that my guitar strap frequenty hangs up on it, knocks it over etc. When I'm trying to switch instruments quickly it's a bummer. And, not surprizingly, it doesn't work with my banjo at all. I've not had the guitar knocked over yet, but I'm always a bit nervous that it will be. You are better off with a full sized stand, even if, like me, the small size and portability are what attracted you."
4,Fender Mini Acoustic Guitar Stand,"I have my classical guitar wresting on this Fender guitar stand.I feel that it leans back slightly too much for 5 stars, but it is quite compact and portable with no screws to worry about. I enjoy the stand and it has shown to be useful for me."
4,it's fine,"It fits my Alvarez classical just fine. Easy to set up and use. No complaints, good price.I recommend it."
5,Acoustic Guitar Stand,"Purchased to hold acoustic guitar. Very stable and doesn't take away from the look of the guitar (it's not garish looking). (Important to my wife, since it sits in the living room next to the piano)"
4,Nice Little Stand,"It's a nice little stand for the price. I was a tad nervous, as I don't have a classic acoustic; I have a slim Ovation electric-acoustic, but it still supports it quite well. I got it because of its ability to fold up and its small size. It's perfect for my dorm room."
5,Best General Commentary,"It has been over 20 years since I finished my studies, but a few books still hold fond memories. Of the many different commentary authors I've read, Barnes' Notes has always stood heads above all others. His writing is mellow, easy to read, not prone to unsubstantiated conjecture, reasonably thorough, and was obviously written by a person more interested in what the Bible said, not in pushing some belief. I highly recommend this set of commentaries for everyone interested in studying the Bible. I have a personal enjoyment for Calvin's works, but Barnes is not to be skipped over. A must-have."
4,A good Commentary,"This is a good buy for anyone who is studying the bible. I personally do not think one should just judge on the element of atonement, whether Jesus died JUST for the elect as most reformers think or that He died for ALL but many refuse His salvation. I personally think that this is a good commentary with a very good perspective in his conjecture. Salvation is salvation. Whether we believe in limited or unlimited atonement should not be the focus. Jesus did die for all and anyone who approaches Him can be saved. Let Him decide who He has elected and let us persuade the unbelievers to salvation through Christ."
1,Tap dances around the divinity of Jesus,"This is modern liberal theology. I would avoid it and would never use notes for serious Bible study. Get a plain Bible and study for yourself in prayer and fasting is better. This one tap dances around the divinity of Jesus. Well this verse says this and that verse says that so what are we to think....? It is like listening to a politician at election time say one thing that can be taken two ways in opposite directions to each other. What does he believe? Hard to tell from the notes. If you believe Jesus is just a good man and teacher, it is in there. if you believe Jesus is God in the flesh, you can find it IF you dig deep and hard enough."
1,Don't Buy this Hitch! It won't fit your Odyssey!!!!,"I just spent 3 hours trying to install this hitch on my new 2009 Honda Odyssey. The problem is that the pre-drilled holes in the hitch don't align well with the mini-van's frame. They are off by a frustrating 1/8"". I am very experienced at do-it-yourself projects and have a PhD in engineering, but the only thing I accomplished with this hitch was getting sweaty and dirty. Now, how do I get my money back for this piece of junk?"
1,Didn't fit my 08 Odyssey,"I thought this was the same hitch as what U-Haul offers. The U-Haul got hitch got good reviews on odyclub but this was cheaper (though the price fluctuates). As with some of the other reviewers the hitch holes did not line up with the holes in the van. The hitch came unboxed so the paint was knocked off in several places. I returned it and went with a Curt hitch which came boxed, has a thick powder coating instead of paint and fit well."
4,History,"The story is a good story, it is Erines Pyles story of the GI's of WW II. Captian Walker is based on a young Captian Henry T. Waskow of Belton, Texas, of th 36th Division. KIA January 10, 1944, in Italy. Pyles books are well worth reading if you have an interested in the stories of the men who were responsible for winning WWII, the boys who did the work, made Generals famous, went unnoticed , came home went to work raised faimlies and made the America we enjoy today."
5,All Thats been said!!,All thats been said about this terrific film is on target.Thanks to Bill Wellman and co we have a REAL WW 11 film.No thanks to Speilbergs and Disney for that TRASH they call war films. These films are nothing but special effects shinola and are an insult to the rank and file American
5,First rate story with fine cast.,"While this is Hollywood's version of war, it is one of the best films of this type. The story is simple and direct. The acting is really supperb. Burges Meridith and Bob Mitchum may have given the best performances of their outstanding careers. The supporting cast is also great with several very execellent performances.Interestingly, many who have seen this film think the end is a little overdone. But it is esentially taken directly from an Ernie Pyle dispatch to the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance. This also appears in his second book of WWII reports ""Brave Men"" as part of Chapter 11, ""Mountain Fighting.""I have waited many years for this film to reappear as a video. They really don't make films like this anymore. See it, you won't be dissappointed."
3,DVD adds little,"I bought this DVD from Amazon as soon as it was released, based on the 5 stars given the film by previous reviewers, and the fact that I have a personal interest in World War II in Italy in particular. It's an okay film; the DVD production adds very little to the original (no audio commentary for example), only a brief film clip of the ""real"" Ernie Pyle talking to some real G.I.s in Italy. The movie itself has some historical interest as it was made before the end of the war. For example, the contemporary account of the battle for Monte Cassino is interesting. According to the liner notes the film was the first to establish certain canonical cliches for its genre, and you will recognize at least some scenes from later films."
5,A classic refurbished.,"The first edition of this book was released while I was in high school and, as an aspiring paleontologist, I immediately fell in love with Stout's beautiful, Art Nouveau dinosaurs. Now this classic has been updated, with new artwork and the inclusion of recent discoveries, making it even more wonderful. This is absolutely some of the most inspiring dinosaur art ever!"
3,Interesting,"A long time Diane Duane fan, I wasn't as satisfied with this book as her other work, but it was full of very interesting concepts, and I loved the two main characters. The end plotting is a little weak, but the world building is a very enjoyable.The cover art does NOT fit the story, but didn't really bother me as artwork. It is annoying that it isn't indicative of the story though.This book looks like it might make a good intro to futher adventures of the main characters, who make a good investigative team. An odd mix of cience fiction and supernatural mystery, but it has a lot of potential. This book doesn't make full use of the potential, but I'm curious to see more of this universe."
3,A different sort of fantasy,"Despite the title this book is not straight fantasy. It is a blending of fantasy and alturnative universe novel. There is both tecnology and magic in this universe. The book is a weird blend of Law and Order episode and fantasy novel that shouldn't work, but does. The magical forensics scenes are the best part of the first half of the book.The plots builds slowly but by the time you get to the end you will be turning the pages as fast as you can read. There are a few holes in the storyline that it seems a writer of Ms. Duane's skill could have closed(the origin of the madrin for example). These few logic flaws keep the book from being perfect, but they do not ruin it.I would like to see other stories written in this universe and I hope there are more in the works. If you like stories that are a little differnt this book should be on your to be read list."
4,Just close your eyes.,"At least until you've opened the cover. I am a 25 year old professional who found Duane only about 5 years ago. As an adult I have loved and cherished her. Each book has been it's own delightful bit of candy for me to unwrap and savor. Therefore I bought this book - despite the horrid, eye-searing cover art - based on her reputation alone. Once again, she delivers her ideas well. Really hoping there's going to be a continuance...I want to know how the big unravelling affects us in the ""real world."" It did take a little while for me to run through this one, but that had more to do with the embarrassed hiding-of-the-cover-on-my-knee-while-reading-in-public thing than the content."
3,Not her best effort,"I have really enjoyed the author's young wizards series. I wanted to like this book as well. The protagonists are interesting and their relationship is a strong point. Unfortunately, the plot drags and I had to force myself to continue at times. As much as I liked the concept of embodied Justice, I disliked the ending which seemingly tried to cover all ideas possible and therefore made limited sense. I would read a follow up novel with these characters, but if you are new to this author's work I suggest starting with ""So You Want to be a Wizard."""
3,Hands of Time is a Hands-Down Winner!,"If I could turn back the hands of time, I would still BUY this CD. Temperance opens If You Don't Know with a soaring dance anthem guaranteed to rival any dance anthem that has come before it! The opening track, ""Hands of Time,"" should have been voted best dance song of the year. This is a magnificent hands-in-the-air anthem with incredible production and a hook sure to send even the most discerning Pop-Dance music critic into orbit. A few other tracks, such as ""Believer"" and ""If You Don't Know,"" help the CD along....though the rest of the songs are just OKAY (hence only 3 stars). Nonetheless, ""Hands of Time"" must be a part of your dance music collection and makes this CD worth every penny!"
1,What a waste! CHEESIEST ALBUM!,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this! I have the first album Virtues Of Life and love it. Thinking it would be along the same lines, I bought this which I'm actually using as a coaster now.I also noticed the producer is not the same on this album. The producer on the other album was Mark Ryan (awesome producer) who was a member of the group before but I read in a magazine that he split from the group.Can this be the cheesiest album ever made?By the way, the 1 star is because I couldn't go lower than that."
5,Fences,Not what I expected. A real page turner that I couldn't put down. Plenty of twists and turns with an ending that caught me completly by surprise.
4,Not the Best Of I'd have made,"Having collected all of the albums on record and cassette, I had high hopes for this release when I got it a few years back. And many of the great rocking songs I like the band for are there. The only difficulty is that they are interspersed with slower songs that I'm not particularly fond of. You get ""Last Chance"" and ""Bring It On"" followed by ""You've Got What I Need"", ""Tonight"" wakes you up again. But then are ""Flesh And Blood"" and the lamentable lament ""Hollywood"" to send you back towards dreamland. The rest of the album and the 2 new tracks at the end are similarly hit-and-miss. I greatly like their rock-band side, and wish that they hadn't followed the rock-and-roll edict that states that every band has to play ballads to show their diversity. I use the ""Next Track"" button on the CD player a lot with this album. Now that their first 5 are available on CD, I expect I will mix my own Best-of, leaving this one behind."
4,"Good brand, decent product",Belkin's a good name. Their stuff is reliable and cost effective. But this keyboard isn't as compact as some competitors. You may want to shop around a bit more.
5,"Excellent book for everyone, not just X-Philes","I thought this was the best X-Files book I have read. The plot was very exciting and always moving at a very thrilling pace. To summarize, Special Agents Mulder and Scully are investigating a death in Central America, where Mulder uncovers what he believes is an Inca temple made for extra-terrestrials. Excellent insight into both Mulder and Scully."
3,Good story marred by reciting of time over and over and over,"This story started out pretty good. I could imagine the Central American jungle quite well as I listened to the tape. M. Pilaggi (sp) aka Skinner has a fine voice. However, at the end of the story, the constant reciting of the time gets very very tiresome. 3:02 am, Friday, shots are fired. 3:03 am, Friday, some more shots are fired. The constant reciting of the time detracts from the story. Mitch, just describe the scene, we listeners are smart enough to realize that the battle happens over the course of one night! I got the feeling that you were stalling for time, trying to use up as much audio tape as possible. Bottom line, buy Ground Zero, then Anti- bodies first."
4,a must for mayfield fans,"Major Lance was a protege of the great Curtis Mayfield. His Sixties recordings were great examples of Chicago sweet Soul. This collection brings together all of his biggest hits and most of his best tracks. The songwriting, arranging and producing is mainly by Curtis Mayfield and is very much in the vein of his classic work with The Impressions--melodic, rhythmically interesting and compelling. Major Lance is vocally quite worthy of the material. The results are a must for any Mayfield fan."
3,best of major lance,"As a cild of the rock n roll/r&b era, I am begining to collect my favorite artist from my youth. Not all of the BEST OF collections are just that. I really like this one and am happy to add it to my growing collection."
3,Japanese track not Dolby TrueHD?,"I don't know about the review of others, but I prefer the original language to the horrific english dubbing. I select the Japanese audio track which states on the box and on the Audio Menu, that the Japanese soundtrack is Dolby TrueHD 2.0, yet oddly enough my amp (Pioneer SC-07) only see's the audio as Stereo only. The preview's and the English track do appear as Dolby TrueHD, just not the Japanese track. If I didn't need it to complete the collection, I would cancel the order for the second half of the series, Soul Eater: The Weapons Collection. I'm sure Funimation will screw this one up also with poor english dubbing and even worse sub-titling. It's as though they do not care for the native language or having to add sub-titles to support it either.One can only hope that other Japanese studios see the terrible job Funimation does and send their business elsewhere."
5,Cute series,I found this to be a good series. Not too violent. Actually had some morals which is a plus but not needed. Cute characters and a good story line. There were a few twists and turns in the story. The story line could be a bit pradicable but there were enough laughs to keep me going. Teenager and young teenager appropriate.
4,Great show,"Watched the entire series. Eagerly awaiting the second half.Soul Eater had everything! There was plenty of action, comedy, and even a few corny bits that are a guilty pleasure! There are a few parts that get annoying and sometimes doesn't even make sense (like how the heck do they get around the world?), but those are within acceptable limits.I won't bother spoiling the plot, that's what Wikipedia and Google are for."
4,"Same old shonen show, but it never gets old.","Soul Eater is a ripoff. That being said, if you've seen Naruto or Bleach, you've seen Soul Eater. It takes the overall concept of Bleach, but surprisingly pretty much everything else is ripped from Naruto.If you are going to combine two of the most currently popular anime and manga into one, do it right, and Soul Eater does it very well. The art style is unique, and I love it. Everything is over the top and frankly its probably more likeable than Naruto.It has a great overall story and some really cool characters. The ending, however, was a completely lame disappointment."
1,No thriller/no story,"Most of the bad reviews for this film say it all...at the end of an excrusiatingly long ,confusing, and rambling movie you are left saying W.T.F....This is a movie that trys to be intellectual and artsy by just being ""out there""...but here's the thing, if your audience doesn't understand it then its just a lot of arty wankers posing trying to make dross look interesting...Loses out on every level"
2,No rest for the wicked...,"As a gay man, I find this production pandering and not entertaining. The plot is chaotic and not at all thriling. For Gay Cinema to follow in the footsteps of mainstream media with their random, idiotic and oh by the way lets make it about porn too.Very sad,Nephillim"
1,Should Have Been Called Borenography,"Pornography: A Thriller is a gay film that I hated, and ranks as one of the top 10 worst I've seen in the last year. First of all, it runs 113 minutes, and nearly all of them are excruciating. The only halfway decent moments occur when Matthew Montgomery is onscreen. And he is only in the middle of the movie. And for a movie with the word ""Pornography"" in its title, it doesn't have any more sex or nudity than an episode of Queer As Folk. And Queer Is Folk is more entertaining, too. Pornography: A Thriller is boring, confusing, frustrating, etc., etc., etc."
1,Did I Say CRACKPOT Outloud?,"Yikes people I'm shocked at how so few folks are seeing a problem with this author.This book and others, as well as his web site are full of rediculous claims and laughable nonsense.I accidentally bought 2 of his books. I wouldn't have needed to get this second one. It's going straightinto the trash. Be wary of spiritual teachers who can't stop themselves from telling you exactlywho they are by airing their ego driven unconscious rants in the public arena. He may at timesbe able to tap into some helpful information and present it appropriatly, but then......he goes offlike he's been down at the local tavern for 3 days. Is anybody editing his stuff?"
1,A poor product,The adjustments come loose after every slice and the wire breaks frequently at the brass insert. This is a poorly engineered product. Don't buy it.
3,stencils,"The stencils are great but you have to soak the paper in mineral oil,then cut them out your self,which means I might ruin them.Them designs are great"
3,Dissappointed in this book!,This book is not what I expected. The recipes are very bland. Not my Mother's or Grandmothers cooking at all. I think I will file this book for the garage sale. :-(
4,Polish American,"Tho my mother was from Poland and she has bunch of Polish cookbooks but this one is her first ""American"" Polish cookbook that was written in English plus using our measurements in right way....She recognized some recipes but a lil different than she normally made...It's an awesome book and I dont cook Polish dinner often and that helped me whenever I borrow her book...Worth to buy it....even if you have daughter or daughter in law to pass this book along."
4,Polish Cookery,"Very interesting to a previous long time resident of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The south side of Milwaukee was occupied primarily by people of Polish descent. In fact the high school I attended was Pulaski High School.The food and meat markets along Lincoln Avenue provided the ingredients for the recipes in this book."
5,Great!,"It came just as described. The DVD was in great shape, no scratches and was packaged well. Just as good as buying it in the store"
4,Nostalgia bomb,"I watched this show when I was in middle school and although its humor isn't top class, its still great."
1,not even shipped yet,this dvd has not shipped yet and its been a whole week u suck balls!!!send me my dvds very disappointing and never will shop with them again ..just send me my movie and ill stop leaving bad comments even tho ur going to delete them as soon as you see it
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This was the stupidest, longest, boringest (if that's a word), most pointless movie I have ever seen in my 23 year existance. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not watch it."
2,Definitely made for TV,"I have to partially agree with H. Kip - though it seems that Texans know next to nothing about the history of North Africa and the Middle East - it would indeed be possible for an Arab, depending on location and ancestry, to have blue eyes.Having said that, the movie does belong in the comedy section. The dialogue is painful to listen to, the plot is slow and scattered, and the acting is...well, funny."
1,3 hours of my life I'll never get back,"Ok actually 2 1/2hours since I fast forwarded through the fight scenes. I think a better title for this would be ""Bored in the desert"" a movie about a group of actors and camera people who are stranded for several weeks in the desert and decide to make a film.The movie suffers from lack of plot, lack of character development, horrible acting and lack of film quality. Perhaps the desert storms were responsible for some major equipment dysfunction. It is pretty obvious the actors were a little confused - their acting is stiff and mechanical - I've seen elementary school plays with more flow. Maybe it's because the story is going nowhere and does nothing. The characters are so empty you really don't care for any of them - except maybe Ben Cross's character who you sort of feel sorry for since he obviously is a villian on the wrong set. Luckily I just rented this and didn't spend money on it. Really it is a ""must NOT see""."
3,Overly Long,"The movie is ok, but it runs on and on. The director did not know where to cut out film when it went through the edit process. I read a story on the making of movie the Lost Horizon, when it was put together it was like 17 hours long, then was cut down to about two hours. This one is about three hours run time and should have been cut in half. A movie is about telling a story, not the film maker falling in love with the film stock."
1,Worst.Acting.Ever.,"This is the worst acting I have ever seen outside of a television sitcom. Once I've said horrible, embarrassing, stinko, insipid, amateurish, and painful, words fail me.Oh, and then there's the heavenly choir singing in the background. Don't get me started on that one..."
1,Don't waste your time on this one...,"Tower of the Firstborn was a slow and badly acted, badly directed, and badly filmed movie. I thought I was watching something that was made back in the 1980's for tv! I think that if the director had been better, the movie might actually have been passable. The girl chosen to play Diane Shannon was a poor actress. I did not believe for one second that she was in love with Rashid. And where did she meet him before? I felt like there was another story there that we were missing all together. They spent too much time on Adriel and Leon and didn't interconnect their characters into the movie well enough.The whole movie seemed choppy and slow. I would like to have read the book (if there is one), it might have made the movie make more sense. The ending was stupid and definitely not worth the 3 plus hours it took to get through it. Definitely a waste of time-watch ""The Mummy"" instead."
1,Wow....this is REALLY Bad..,"Rented this and we're 90 minutes into it and....duhhhhh. I have to agree with the other reviewer. This is a long movie (190 minutes) and it is so poorly made, it is laughable! Oh well, you win some, you lose some. My advice - Don't bother renting this. We may not even finish watching it. Oh, what in the world happened to Ben Cross? He starred in Chariots of Fire and he's now starring in this movie? It is such poor quality!"
2,Data transfer indeed but wish for phone settings control too.,"This product does what its name implies - and that's just about it. Full access to settings on the phone (as can be controlled using the phone) is what I would prefer. It is certainly easier to use a computer to control such a device rather than the limited keys of the cell phone. Sidebar: 9 months after purchasing this software here it said my subscription had expired and could not get updates or use the data transfer features. A call to LG deferred me to the folks that actually make the software (which is NOT LG). Eventually, the software kicked on again without my action. My presumption is, (quoting the LG rep) that ""many complaints of this problem"" inspired LG or its ""partner"" to fix the matter."
5,Great Naad,"This CD is terrific... I picked this for my forty day mantra and it's one that you really can grow with. I was reading other people's reviews however and I think using these CD's and others like them while driving is not advisable, even if it is a protection mantra. Listen to it in the parking lot and then take your pranayama on the road!"
3,not the best book,"I was shopping for a book on Mr. Begin because I had just finished 'the Revolt' written by him. I wanted a general biography covering the post war years and the struggle in the Political realm as well as details of his decision to invade lebanon and the peace with Egypt. This book, although it details his life, is profoundly popular history. IN effect a new biography needs to be written on Begin because it is hard to find a good one."
5,Eligh's Best Work,The beats that Eligh Created for this CD are simply fascinating. I listen to this cd every day and i do not get tired of it. I highly recommend this CD to any fan of hip hop.
3,WAR in PIECES,"Like the other Hyun Se Lee titles I've read, NAMBUL is an epic tale that stretches over multiple volumes, with dozens of characters. With that said, it's easy to see why NAMBUL 1 reads like the intro to an overall greater work, because it is.NAMBUL is the tale of a (semi) ficticious war between Japan and Korea, and although it isn't set in any definite time period, it certainly echoes many of today's global issues...particularly issues surrounding fossil fuels and what oil-hungry nations will do to procure them.While it is based on various historical turning points, it creates its own war-like atmosphere from a civilian point of view. The characters hold very distinctive personalities and some with strong views on nationalism, which will draw you into the story. As we get to know them better, they become more realistic, and as the entire plot plays out we see how the story works simultaneously on a personal level and on a global scale.As always, the artwork by Mr. Lee is fantastic."
2,Perfectly average,"With all due respect to those who wrote glowing reviews of this CD (and there were many), this has to be the most average CD I've ever heard. While there really is nothing bad about it that I can think of, absolutely nothing sticks in my mind either. The singing is competent, but it doesn't stand out for me. There are some good instrumental breaks, though. Listening to this CD is like drinking water -- I have nothing against it, but it's just as flavourful to my ears."
5,Al Kooper COULD Be President of General Motors...,"Considering the shape they're in today, it could be a big improvement.This was, of course, a huge sleeper in its day. Unlike the later Clayton-Thomas BST album, this one produced no ""Top Ten"" played hits. However, as a concept album it was great, and as one which paved the way for white-boy blues, it was something really new.We loved them more than they'd ever know...and hey, look closely at the album cover. Take it from me - this was WAY before Photoshop.Hipgnosis - how did they DO that, anyway??"
5,One of my favorite for ALL TIME,"I first heard this album when it came out in 67. I've been listening to it ever since...probably 2 to 3 times each week for the past 40 years. It has a soul and depth that I just never get tired of. Al Kooper was the heart AND the soul of this group and I wished they would have continued in this direction instead of the Clayton-Thomas direction. I think the legacy would have been better. Kooper showed his skills in terms of writing and production....the album lives up to the test of time and continues to amaze me each time I hear it. The bass lines, alone, are worth the price of admission....what an incredible bass player. Anyway, buy it, sit down, and listen...then listen again...and again...and again. Before long, you'll be humming songs from it all day. Honest!!!"
3,Confused identity yields short-lived promise,Noteworthy debut does contain more misses than what is generally acknowledged but still shows an adept range amidst the jazz-rock spectrum that only felt betrayed with further releases.
5,The first book my baby loved,"The story is so sweet it makes a new mom cry. The pop-up format catches the attention of babies (say about 5 months) who really aren't ready to ready yet, but need a gimmick to help them along. Right now we've had to put the book away, at 18 months, my baby is too rough to handle pop up books, but I have it saved for a second life when he grows older and begins to like it for the story as well as the pictures.Where and when are they coming out with ""Are you my Daddy""? No one seems to carry it ?"
2,Not the best...,"One of the reviewers here said that these compilations have lost steam since Jose Padilla left...that is right and wrong. While I do think vols. 1-6 are all must haves, let's not forget 7&8, both of which are excellent. Vol. 9 is widely considered by most Cafe Del Mar fans to be the weakest in the series (just avoid it all together) and vol. 10 seems to be heading more in the direction of the last volume. One of the reasons why I (and most people) listen to this type of music is to transport us into another world...to make us feel transcendent or alive in a way other music just doesn't. Besides the last few songs, most of this lackluster and boring comp. is repetitive and just not very interesting. Bottom line: If you didn't like vol. 9, you will not like this one either. If you're new to the Cafe Del Mar cd's and this is your first purchase, go back and buy vol. 5 (the best IMO) and then move on the the far superior Hotel Costes or Buddha Bar series."
2,way to spacy... what happened to the warm summer feeling?,"The Cafe del Mar series quickly seem to loose their warm summer vibe feeling... As one of the best compilation series around, They magically used to reflect the sun, sea, warmth, and sexy smooth ibiza feelings. Helping you to relive your summer holiday in Greece, Spain or Italy when you were enjoying your HUGE cocktail. But halfway volume 9, continuing in volumes 10 and 11, the series lost this feeling. They become WAY TOO SPACY... sounding too much like ultra-clean techno studio mixes without any mediteranean passion. The earlier cafe del mar editions used to give you that great vibe. I suggest you stick to the previous volumes 1-8 (maybe 9) and spend your money on other compilation instead. Believe me, you won't regret."
2,Not so much,"I've been a die hard fan of the Cafe Del Mar releases, but in my opinion, since Jose Padilla quit compiling the compilations (Vol 6), the series have suffered. Cafe Del Mar Vol 5 is my favorite, but since the release of Vol 8, the music has been to new age sounding, and been lacking the soulful down-tempo grooves, which is what originally attracted me to the series. I listened to this CD at a local shop, but didn't end up buying it. I think the Man Ray series would be a better purchase."
3,Changing...and going modern the stile,"I think that Cafe del Mar is changing the basic elements which were the beginning of this series.I like it, but maybe if you are a really fanatic of Cafe del Mar...be sure you gonna hate this one...so much modern...another stile mixing the sound...But i like...."
2,Could use a bit of fact-checking or editing,"This book is really the only one of its kind, so it may be an OK resource to start. However, it is somewhat poorly designed, with the TOC, list of campgrounds, and unlabeled map all on separate pages, so you are flipping around and around trying to see which campgrounds are near your desired destination and what page they are on. There is an error on the map as well, with two locations labeled ""12"".Unfortunately, one of the most lovingly-described campgrounds, Orr's Island, is in fact an RV-only no tents allowed campground. I recommend doing research after getting a ""feel"" from this book."
3,Not sure yet...,"Well we used the book for the first time this weekend and picked a tent spot that was highly recommended in the book. The site did not match the description in the book at all making me think the guy did not visit this particular campground, but maybe just looked at the online campground map and made up suggestions. I will try another campground to see if this holds true, hopefully not."
1,The Best in Tent Camping: New England,"The prime reason anyone would buy this seemingly unreliable book is to find the best New England campites. However, the campsite numbers are incorrect. For instance, in the section on Lamoine State Park, the numbers on the campgound map do not match the official Maine State Park online map. In referring to the views of sites 48 through 54, the author states: ""These are views of Frenchman's Bay and its islands worthy of the Rockfellers."" The sites are not ""along the road facing the ocean"" and do not have such views. Due to such carelessness readers cannot rely on this book to make camping plans, some might infer."
3,Why include a severly truncated version of her biggest hit??,"Shannon's biggest hit, the one enduring song in her catalogue, is ""Let The Music Play,"" one of the 1980s' most immortal dance songs. Finally, a greatest hits is issued and one can have these songs on CD...but the version of ""Let The Music Play"" included her is a severely edited version, not even the single version, which I used to have on a 45!! What on earth was the logic behind that? And yet we get the full length versions of her non-hits. What a bummer. Also missing is ""It's Over Love,"" her late 1990s collaboration with Todd Terry which was a NUMBER ONE HIT on the dance charts. What were the people who put this together smoking????"
1,I wish the music was playing right,"Shannon was one of my favorite artist from the 80s. Her strong vocal combined with the genius of Chris Barbosa and Mark Liggett production team made the Let the Music Play album timeless.And just out of the blues, I found out that Shout Factory was releasing a best of album and I was excited. Well I bought the CD and I was bitterly disappointed. The sound quality is good but not excellent. They could have at least remastered it.And also there was a MAJOR blunder. How did this album pass Quality Inspection?? One of my favorite energized songs ""One Man"" is not transfered correctly. There's an annoying noise flickering at 2.11 min"
4,A trip down memory lane,"A great compilation of Shannon's. The only thing that would have made this complete would have been the addition of the song ""Dancin"". All in all, a disc worthy of purchase. I enjoyed it alot."
2,Not the Best,"I believe that a lot of these songs are forgetable to say the least, but other people might be bigger Shannon fans than I am. I'm actually giving this a low rating because the remastering on this wasn't very good. You can definitely tell on the song ""One Man,"" which is very distorted at some points."
4,Nice Try,"Anton tries hard. Unfortunately Ludwig did not give him enough good material to work with. I prefer Mozart sonatas, myself. Good liner notes though, but no plastic container! Good value, for the money. Sound seems to fade out a bit on recording at times, but (maybe?) this was intentional (if Ludwig could tell us). Compare this collection to others and it is probably better, but costs less. Compare this to Brendel's set. If Brendel get 5 stars then this should too. But, I give it 4 stars anyway, since this is the job of a music critic."
2,Nice toy but pretty useless in low light conditions,"I love my A500 Samsung phone! I even like the camera and how Sprint has set it up so you can share pictures. I can even put up with the low quality of the photos because it is understandable that they are trying to keep the files small. I could put up with all that much better if I could take pictures indoors or at night. The camera has no flash. Most of the times when I want to share a moment, the quality is really aweful. If you get the camera for free in a package it is worth playing with it and when you can get a good picture you'll be happy, but the unless you're always shooting outside, you will be dissapointed."
3,JUST OKAY,"Saw Steve ,Bob, and Rich play many times during my years at KU. They absolutely rocked! First Rainmakers CD is much better than this one, but still worth adding to your collection if you are a die hard. 'Did you see the Lightning"" is a great tune!"
5,"New York Times says ""much comfort""","Jane Brody, The New York Times, says that, ""With or without outside support, you can find much comfort as well as solid practical advice. . . sisters discuss how to handle other people's reactions, keep the rest of your life going, and find the best way to cope."" The touching presentation and the endearing drawings make it safe and easy to read. It is a sweet little book."
2,Not water resistant to 99 feet,"This watch is water resistant, but not to 99 feet. The materials with it advise hand washing resistance only."
2,"Well, it certainly is Celtic.","My friend let me borrow this album. He said he hated it. He wanted to know what I think. I played it, I don't think I heard one electric on there. I did hear an acoustic on every song though. I also heard an abundance of flutes and fiddles though. I don't recall hearing any rock on this album, maybe a lot of folk, but not rock. Even so, some of the songs are cool. I like ""Bonnie Winds"" by Bohinta. But, in my opinion, if you REALLY want to hear Celtic music, and you aren't used to folk, go get some Van Morrison, U2, or the Cranberries. Not worth your hard earned money, no matter how cheap it is.2 stars, 1 for good acoustic guitar riffs.1/2 for some pretty nifty lyrics.1/2 for the use of instruments I don't hear too much of."
3,Cellar Dweller,If you like comics or like to draw this movie may change your mind. It is a unique (a little low budget) movie about a comic book creature that comes to life and starts killing people. The Dweller himself is one of a kind. A comic horror that no movie collector should be with out.
2,Art Imitates Death...,"I watched CELLAR DWELLER online, in order to find out why it's never had an official DVD release. Well, after seeing it, I believe I know the answer. This movie is late 80s / early 90s cheeeze at its most pungent! The plot: a comic illustrator joins an artist colony (run by Yvonne De Carlo!), and discovers that her work calls forth a demon that kills and eats the other colonists. Now, I know that makes it sound like a masterpiece, but trust me, it ain't! First off, the demon is an overly-cute, seven foot pile of rubber. It inspires no fear, and gives hell itself a bad name. The only reasons I bumped this one up a star are 1- it contains the most idiotic, ridiculous piece of ""performance art"" ever filmed! And 2- The ending veers wildly from eye-rolling wimp-out, to downbeat, ""twist"" ending. After witnessing this, I'm surprised it made it onto VHS format. P.S.- For all Jeffery Combs addicts, he's only in the beginning for about four minutes..."
2,Skydancers-Dangerous Fun,"My friend got her daughter two of these dancers for her birthday and besides just about putting an eye out a few times at the birthday party, they also claimed some of little Emily's hair as it got wound up around the base of the launcher. The girls had a lot of fun with them as long as they were played with outside and kept away from their hair. They seemed to fly up pretty well as long as an adult did it. The kids couldn't quite seem to point it in the right direction and launch it at the same time. The videos however are another story....both my daughter and her friend love them and watch them a lot! My husband can't stand the videos, but then again, they weren't made for adult males."
1,i hate them,i hate these ugly dolls. there hair is ugly and so are there face. they dont fly really high and when they do they go all over my room! every time they land they HIT something EVERYTIME!dont buy this doll or toy or dont even go near it. ITS A MONSTER!
2,Not worth it!,"My daughter wanted this toy after seeing it on TV. This toy could be very dangerous, if there is no adult supervision. Also, I think its overpriced. I have never before felt the need to write a review of something but this is one of the worst toys I have ever bought! My daughter (4-1/2) loves it but from a parents point of view, spend your $ on something else!"
2,Broken String Blues,"My five year old daughter was so excited to get two skydancers for Christmas. On the first ""warm"" Michigan day we had, she and my husband took them for a spin. The first time Angelica's string was pulled the fastener came flying off and the string went into the launcher. There is no way to retrieve the string, tweezers are too big for the opening and there are no screws holding the bottom section together. What a devastating disappointment for her. Of course, I promised her a new one and I will superglue the fastener and string before we send it in launch mode again."
4,"Fun toy, my daughter loves the video","My daughter is three and she played with the toy a bit after getting it for Christmas. She likes it, but the video is something else. She loves the video so much. She has watched it everyday since Christmas. We were letting her watch more tv after the holidays, so there were a couple of days she watched it twice. It's not really educational, but it has left quite an impression on her. She sings the songs and plays games with her little sister based on the video."
2,Not for younger ones,"This toy seemed to be one of the most popularly requested Xmas gifts by my daughter and her friends (around age 4). We were disappointed. It was very difficult for her to operate, and most of her attempts sent the thing flying at dangerous whirling speeds at herself or other objects. Its longterm enjoyment value seems limited. She did enjoy the DVD, but the skydancer itself has already been completely forgotten by her."
2,Three defective toys in a row,"My sister bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. She was thrilled. It flies really high. However, after about 5 flights, the string jammed. Neither my husband nor I could fix it, so we returned it to the store figuring it was a problem with just that one. They gave us a new one and the same thing happened within about three days. I stupidly bought one more and again the same thing happened in a matter of days. Sorry, but three strikes and you're out. I was really steamed. It's a shame because it really is a cute toy."
3,Lots of fun but fragile,"My grandaughter was so thrilled when she received this toy for her birthday. She saw it on TV and wanted it very much. Unfortunately, it only lasted a couple of weeks before it would not function properly. The string got stuck inside and so she does not fly. My son attempted to fix it but the base is glued together so there is no access to the inside by a screw or otherwise. She loves the DVD and watches it constantly."
2,Broke after a few hours of play,"This toy is super fun, but the string broke on the inside of the base. We only had the toy for 24 hours when it broke. It was fun while it lasted."
4,This toy is pretty neat!,"I was concerned about buying this toy at first, since it was recalled years ago for safty reasons but as long as you instruct those playing with it not to shoot it toward others and to keep it away from their eyes its ok (I say ""those"" because we have found that any adult close to this toy will play with it as much as the kids). My daughter just loves it!! I'm a little concerned on durability because it seems as though the pull string is already catching. My daughter can not wait until its warm enough outside to see just how high it will fly outdoors. We have not watched the DVD yet, so can not comment on it."
1,broken after 12 hours!,This was a birthday present and was used quite a bit on the first day. By the next morning the string was stuck inside and there is no way to open it up to untangle it. My daughter was bummed out because she liked it and it was fun when it worked. Not worth your money! It will break!
4,His covers sparkle!,"Paul covers Tom Wait's ""Wherever I lay my hat"" in an ecstatic fashion. This is the best of the best. ""I Was in Chains"" is a lilting tale of a British convict shipped to Australia; exquisite! The man's voice is warm and melodic. Grab it!"
5,super hits review,"I had been looking for this artist for quite some time. I was told by a friend that I should try Amazon.com and research it. That is exactly what I did and have enjoyed the cd very much. The sound was right on and the songs included on this cd were most of what I was hoping would be there. The fact that I could listen to a few bars of the songs list helped make up my mind. I would recommend Amazon.com to all my friends. I have since bought a number of other items and only had to return one so far, I call that a bargain."
3,Get it for the Joy Division cover.,"""Everytime you go away"" is a classic piece of 80s music that to me is sort of timeless. Joy Division fans may want to hear his version of their immortal ""Love will tear us apart"". Don't expect it to sound as brooding as Ian Curtis' vocals but it's still cool to hear that song covered by a pop figure. Hearing ""Everytime you go..."" makes me think of John Candy in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (Its the ending song)."
5,"LOVE IT! The feeder NEVER falls off, even in wind!","Even on the windiest of days my feeder never falls off unlike the other kind of hooks that have the upward hook. This is an awsome hook, heavy duty and well worth the money. I I just wish it hung out a little further from the deck."
3,Not suitable for all deck rails...,"... especially if you want your feeder to hang OFF your deck rather than OVER it. Due to the way the rail overhang is structured on our deck (with the lip for the mount facing out) the only way to position the pole is OVER the deck -- the birds come and create an unholy mess that we'd much prefer having drop below (off the deck) out of sight and mind. This would not be an issue had the unit been designed to swivel. Alas, it is a fixed position unit so we are stuck using this to hang a potted plant.Further, this mount is suitable for small feeders ONLY.Glad it wasn't too expensive and because it is well built, it does make for a decent pot hanger..."
2,A little displeased with it.,The Audubon Deck Mount is ok for small bird feeders. I had a larger hopper feeder made of wood and on one windy day it destroyed it because the the angle is really steep.
3,A Bracket Too Narrow,"This product is nicely made and would probably work well on older deck railings that are made with 2x4's, but the jaws that are supposed to clamp onto the deck rail are too narrow to attach to the thicker composite railing that I have (2 1/2""). It would have been good, in the 'specifications' section in the product description, if the maximum deck rail thickness allowed could have been specified in addition to the length and overhang distances so that the product return would not have been necessary."
4,Ice does not last for 5days,"I bought this to use at work for water. If we fill it with Ice the ice keeps over night but not for 5days even if you dont open the top, which I cant complain about because it keeps it cold. The spout however is a tad leaky but nothing that cant be fixed by holding the glass under it for a few more seconds. I would recommend this to any one who really does NEED the ice to last for up tp 5days."
1,Grammatical Disappointment!,"Der? Die? Das? Your guess is as good as mine. No Articles!! VERY disappointing for an otherwise excellent reference. However, in all fairness to the author, it's an excellent reference for the native German speaker who needs to reference the English words. Native English speakers: beware."
1,avoid like the plague,"I cannot use this guitar. When I bend the strings, it produces a horrible scratching sound which renders the guitar unusable. The fret markers amazingly HAVE GROOVES, which causes friction against the string when bent. Also, there are numerous cosmetic imperfections and defects which annoy me while playing this guitar.The strings have oxidation (even the spare strings) which causes additional friction when playing.The cheap, plasticky tuning keys do not stay in place, and the guitar gets out of tune after only three songs or less.I could live with the physical defects, however when playing higher notes (10th fret and above), the string is barely audible, even when applying higher finger pressure than usual, which means the neck is BENT! I CANNOT USE THIS GUITAR.I NEED TO RETURN IT."
3,Almost a Classic,"i really liked this movie. I think Bill Plympton is one of the most interesting and surrealist animators out there. He strikes me as a Garrison Keillor on LSD, down-home and folksy, yet imaginative and twisted. I'll assume you've read the storyline from one of the other reviews.... The animation is top-notch and suprised me in its graphic nature. I was pleased that Plympton decided to ""let it all hang out"". The visual puns are funny as hell and the songs are catchy and cute. The dissapointing thing is that it just seems to run out of steam in the end. Plympton seems to be a one-two punch kind of guy, quick, funny. A *great* 15-minute cartoon writer. when he gets to trying to stretch his stuff to an hour, it gets a little bit winded. I'd actually probably give this 3 1/2 stars. Watch it, enjoy it. It isn't a mega-classic but It's worth your time."
4,This is insane.. I love it!!,"This animated filth-filled film is a trip. Packed with animated violence, gore, sex and nudity it's a rare guilty pleasure for the insane side of us all. Well not everybody, I take that back. Some will find ""I MARRIED A STRANGE PERSON"" appalling and self indulgent. Yes, I guess it is self indulgent being that it's right up my alley as far as morbid, sex crazied entertainment goes."
3,Dissapointing!,"I am a huge Bill Plympon fan. This film, however, was a bit of a dissapointment for me. For some reason, I just couldn't get into it. Perhaps it was too sex-heavy for too long. Perhaps it was the poor animation quality (which is Bill's style) that got to me over an extended viewing. Perhaps it was the silliness.I guess excessive is the perfect way to describe this film. It was too excessive in every way. Yes, excessive is a perfect description!"
1,Not satisfied,The whole booklet reeked of heavy smoke scent. It is almost unbearable. I am not satisfied with this purchase at all.
5,I can't wait to pick up this book. AW is the best soap on tv,I have been watching ANOTHER WORLD for over 10 years. I started watching when Anne Heche played Vicky/Marley. When she left I watched sporatically but in the last 2 years I have become hooked again. When I heard that NBC had cancelled it I was devastated. AW is such a wonderful show with incredible actors and great storylines. The fact that NBC would cancel AW when there was another soap on NBC with lower ratings makes me furious. Don't the fans count? Don't ratings count? I will never ever watch NBC again and I hope all AW fans do the same. There are several programs on NBC that I used to watch but they may as well cancel them too because I can not look at the NBC logo without feeling angry and betrayed. Good-bye NBC. FANS OF ANOTHER WORLD PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP. HOPEFULLY ANOTHER NETWORK WILL DECIDE TO AIR ANOTHER WORLD. WRITE CBS OR ABC. LET'S SAVE AW. IT'S THE BEST SHOW ON TV AND IT DESERVES 35 MORE YEARS ON TELEVISION
5,I am saddened...,"... by the announcement, yesterday, that ""Another World"" will be cancelled as of 26 June '99. As a 30 year viewer I have come to look forward to the happenings in the lives of my ""friends and family"" in Bay City and am extremely unhappy (I'm being kind...) with NBC's decision. Owning this book will be a bitter sweet reminder of the characters I have come to know and love and I will be glad for that. THANK YOU FOR 35 WONDERFUL YEARS ""AW""!!!"
4,An incredible review of my favorite soap!,"Another World was by far the best show on television, and after 35 years it was regretfully cancelled. Luckily you can relive all the best moments of Anoter World. There are plot synopses from 1965 (Pat Matthew's illegal abortion) to 1999. Although I wish this book had been published after the last episode so we could get the complete story. There are cast remembrances and great photos! This book will help you relive your favorite memories of this truly memorable show!"
5,How timely!,"To think: if Victoria Wyndham hadn't made a quick commercial for this book to show on AW last week, I might have missed it! It is my consolation (however small) for losing so many friends from the past 17 years. The book is a bit thin on AW's early years (and there's no good excuse for that) and I wish they'd print a supplement to include 1999, but I'm very pleased. It helps me fill in plot lines from the first 18 years that I missed. I just hope As The World Turns will keep Vicky, Jake, Cass & Lila on as regulars. (They appear June 28).Linda Foh"
5,Worth Buying Again,"I already own the complete series on DVD, so at first I ignored the Blu Ray release. There are tons of things I'd like to buy and I have a limited budget. But I kept reading review after review praising the Blu Ray's quality. Now I never thought the DVDs looked bad, but I got curious. How much better could the Blu Ray release really be? A whole lot. There are already some great reviews posted here about what they did to clean the show up. I just want to chime in and say that as a fan of the series and someone on a budget, it was definitely worth the upgrade. Not all Blu Ray releases are worth the extra cash, especially if you already own the series. But this one is."
5,Much better than the DVD...,"I've only watched the first two episodes, and I can say that if you have the DVDs, I would recommend double dipping. The picture is much clearer."
5,"One of the Top Animes of All Time, Beautifully Remastered!","Funimation has truly outdone themselves with this release. The series has been beautifully restored from the original negatives, and the results are just outstanding. The colors are bold and bright, and you can fully appreciate the early 90's hand-drawn animation. The English dub has a fantastic cast and good scripting, so much so that I prefer the English dub to the original Japanese (although both are included). They don't make 'em like this anymore!If you've never seen this series, you're in for a treat. It's a great mix of drama, comedy, action, and even some romance. It's got it all. The main characters are all one of a kind and like-able.This is an essential purchase for even the most casual anime fan."
5,Brilliant,"A great classic in the best quality you can get. The only thing I wish it had was widescreen, those black bars can be a bit annoying."
2,Below average,I bought this shirt and had to return it immediately. First of all the shirt was squeezed into an envelop and that really put me off. Aside that the white is not bright for my liking. The design is however beautiful
4,very impressed,"I liked this book. I had thought the Alexander technique was all about posture, when in fact it's all about performance - the way that we do what we do. There are some great stories in this book which I have enjoyed reading again and again.The author clearly knows his stuff and how to write. Having read many books about change and the Alexander Technique this has to go down as one my favourites. I recommend it to anyone looking to change deep-seated patterns of behaviour that are undermining their performance in any field."
5,"Gustave Baumann, an incredible craftsman","the title says it all,....""Hands of a Craftsman."" This book covers the woodcut artwork of Gustave Baumann in great detail. There are sections that cover his process of printing, and how each block is carved to produce the final image. Each print is done the good ol' fashion way,...by hand, and the result is brilliant, and unique, and beautiful. I use this book to show my woodcut students how a multi-color block print is made, it has a wonderful guide and clear photographs how this is done."
3,Pioneer headphones,Look & feel sturdy. Close out external noise good to hear tracks through headphones. Folded up nice for travel!! But not very comfortable & treble overshadows the bass.. My cheaper Sony's are much more comfortable & tones are more even & easier on the ears at loud volumes than this Pioneer. But we'll see how it does once I get use to it.
5,I love them,"I got these headphones after previous ones busted while on a trip. My DJ cousin took me to a DJ store where I could actually find some good equipment. It's been more than two years since then, and they are still my ""good"" headphones. They have very good clarity and frequency response. I normally prefer ""around the ear"" headphones and can see how some would find this uncomfortable after a period of time, but I don't really notice it. I didn't think I'd like the mono feature as much as I have (I'm not a dj or music pro), and I use it when I want to listen to two things at once (imagine that). Overall I gave this a 5 star rather than a 4 star (for possible discomfort) because I have taken these headphones overseas, cross-country and through numerous mp3 players, and they are my standard for high-quality music."
1,Faulty,Just got the SE DJ5000 after a long wait. The left headphone was not working. The pair is faulty and I am very very very disappointed. I was not expecting this from Amazon since I have shopped many times before.
5,A Good Family Movie,"I have watched this movie several times and each time I watch it, I seem to like it more. It is a good family movie. Movies about Australia and horses are always my favorites. Andrew Clarke and Wendy Hughes were excellent in their roles. I would like to see more movies with these two people."
1,No Good in Rain or Wind,"Although the tent was large and looked good, I would never recommend this tent to anyone who expects any rain or wind while camping. Rain leaked through the top on to our stuff (including our bedding). And if we hadn't been in the tent to hold it up during a windy spell, it would have come completely down. Also, the instructions appear to have been written by someone who has NO command of the English language. They were incomplete and hard to understand. It was made in China, so I guess they let the Chinese write the instructions too, which was a very bad idea. When our 5 days of camping were over, the tent was promptly deposited into the dumpster. We will never buy this brand again."
2,NOT TO BE USED IN RAIN,THE TENT IS ROOMY NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. EASY TO PUT UP FOR SUCH A LARGE TENT BUT WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE WASHINGTON STATE COAST CAMPGROUND CALLED KALALOCH WHICH WAS MISTY UPON ARRIVING AND PROCEEDED TO START TO RAIN THAT NIGHT INTO THE NEXT AFTERNOON IN WHICH THE TENT WITH THE RAIN SKIRT WAS LEAKING AND BECAME TOTALLY SOAKED WHICH COULD HAVE RUINED ANYBODY ELSE'S VACATION BUT WE BROUGHT 2 TENTS AND WE ENDED UP MOVING INTO THE OTHER WITH OUR GRANDKIDS UNTIL OURS DRIED OUT IF IT NEEDED TO BE SPRAYED WITH WATERPROOFING THEN IT SHOULD OF BEEN MENTIONED IN THE DIRECTIONS LIKE MY OTHER TENT
1,Can't play the game!,"The purchase was fine and the game was new in the wrap, but after I downloaded the game and tried to play it I was booted off!! So I wasted my money on a game I can't play. It's not the seller's fault!!! I tried to reach the game support but they said they couldn't help me because it's an unknown copy?? Whatever that means?? So I couldn't download the patch to help me play the game! I won't buy anymore games through the mail."
1,DID NOT WORK,Game didn't work on any of my computers. Got hopes up just to get let down! They need to make updated SIMs for the newer systems!!
4,Great way to take leftovers for lunch,This corning ware product is great for individual servings. I'm very busy so often cook on sunday for the week. I put about 8 servings into these dishes and freeze for the week. If I'm too tired to fix something when I get home I pull a meal from the freezer and it's ready to go. I don't like to reheat in the microwave in plastic. I think this is a much healthier alternative. They are also the perfect size for one serving. They are sturdy and last just about forever incuding the cover. I haven't had the same luck with other products. They would be a little difficult to use for an older adult however because the top on the newer version is more difficult to remove.CorningWare Pop-Ins 8-Piece Oval Bake and Serve SetI've used them for several years and they are my first choice for my busy life style.
4,vest,"Looks to be what I need. Will be riding a motorcycle up in Sturgis, SD where the temperatures will vary between really cool to really hot."
3,so so,"i bought it as a gift. Its really warm and comfy, but it showed up with a hole near the zipper and it is a little lower quality looking. I also thought it was a off center zipper because of the picture, but it turned out to be a regular centered zipper. Overall its ok, and good as a layering piece."
2,"Nice color and warm, pocket torn open in 1 month","I like the look and feel of the vest. The blue color fits well and is quite warm.My vest came with some loose threads on the right pocket. Then it completely torn open after the last wash, it's only a month since my purchase. Amazon was nice enough to offer to refund the purchase (I had to pay the return shipping) after the 1 month mark. I'm terribly disappointed, since the other parts look and feel solidly built.I would not recommend this vest due to the quality of the inside pocket construction. I ended up buying a Timberland at a local Macys, which has a much better pocket construction, it also felt a little warmer than the Katahdin."
2,"Not an interesting Blood, Sweat & Tears gold collection!","I would'nt recommend getting this compilation CD album because I have all of these songs on my ""What Goes Up! The Best of"" two double single compact disc set which are excellent tunes to listen except for ""Just One Smile"" that I don't have on my collection!"
4,Watch,My husband needed a new watch and this is a good one. But he's having trouble adjusting the day.
3,good looking but a bit difficult...,"I recently bought this watch as a gift for my husband. He loved the look of it but found setting the date was a bit hard to do and the band was too big. When he attempted to make the band smaller, he ended up contacting Citizen for some assistance. It turns out, a special Citizen tool is to be used to remove extra links. He found a store that carried this brand and they did the adjustment for him. Now he's a happy camper."
5,Geniuses Revealed,"Colored Lights: Forty Years of Words and Music, Show Biz, Collaboration, and All That JazzAn absolutely fascinating look into the hearts and minds and working habits of two men who contributed so much to the American Theater over the last half century. Fred Ebb is no longer with us, so we can be truly thankful that he and John Kander collaborated on this book while he was still alive. As a songwriter myself, I always find such memoirs interesting and valuable."
4,Good,It is in a good condition.If you're wondering if it comes with a CD... mine came with one.i would recommend this.
1,This is not a DICTIONARY,"This whatever it is was compiled by a LINGUISTICS professor by having his students wear tape recorders to record conversations for two weeks feed them into a computer and pop out a mess of words. This could have been accomplished by watching MTV for two weeks.It lists ESPN as a NOUN!!! It's an ACRONYM. PBS is also a NOUN in this dictionary (?) which again is an acronym but even worse the definition is: ""PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM; A COMPANY IN THE U.S. THAT BROADCASTS TELEVISION PROGRAMS WITHOUT ADVERTISEMENTS."" Huh!!!? PBS is a non profit broadcasting company that broadcasts cultural and educational programs. It is not about whether it has advertisements or not!!!Unless you teach a class that would require an example of bad reference material I would reccomend not wasting your money on this."
5,easy to understand to ESL people,"I recommend this dictionary to new immigrants in their ESL study. Their definition to words are clear and easy to catch. Besides that,workbook and pictures are much help.However, attached CD support by Apple itune software,it does not work alone unless you pay extra money."
2,Longman Dictionary of American English with Thesaurus and CD-ROM,"this dictionary doesn't with CD, but the title show me it had CD..but here only have one dictionary. But they came fast, that is good."
4,New Type of Dictionary,I bought this dictionary because I am a special education teacher and heard that this dictionary is good for ELL students as well as special education students. It is a very interesting new way of defining words. It uses simple informative language and doesn't send the searcher all over its pages to get the actual definition. Its pronunciation key is VERY different from other dictionaries and is a bit too complicated because it differentiates the sounds of diphthongs very specifically. But overall I like it.
5,"Excellent episode and cast guide, complete series index.","A must for any real Blake's 7 fan! Contains complete information regarding cast, directors, producers, plot summaries and interviews with several cast members and others. Index defines every term used in the series."
3,Typical MacDonald,"John D MacDonald was famous for his Travis McGee books but before he started writing those, he was writing novels like Area of Suspicion (1954).The novel centres around a man whose brother was killed and he returns to the city of the crime to clean up the affairs. Turns out that the death was suspicious and to make matters worse, the brother's wife is our heroes former girlfriend.I don't think that MacDonald's strength lay in his action, it was the background to the stories and the fleshing out of the characters. MacDonald was a master at describing the scenery, much like James Lee Burke is today.This novel is a typical MacDonald, it is well-written, interesting and worth reading but it does lack a little bit of substance."
3,A Pretty good soundtrack,"This cd is actually pretty good. It has a pretty good musical score, and I like the first two songs. The songs go well with the movie. Some people may like it, others may not. As for me I think it's OK."
5,former college hockey player and father says first rate,"I highly recommend this book to any father, coach or athlete of any age. I think if I had read it in high school, it may have changed my outlook on sports and life. The book takes you from a player and his father's beginnings in sport, through other people's (parent's) interferences to show how following one's goals can lead to success."
2,Too self serving!,"I thought this book was very self serving. I almost didn't finish reading it until I got to the chapter where Dan's son decided to go to Canada. I think it's great that his family was blessed with all the talent but I felt like he was stuffing down my throat. Having a son that has the dream of being in the NHL, it was worth finishing the book to finally get to know what it really takes to get there."
5,Captivating Family Story,"Phyllis Dixon has managed to capture in graphic details, the circus which surfaces at the first sign of illness or death. Her portrayal of family struggles over money and property was definitely accurate.But this story was not just about bickering over assets, it was a reminder of just WHAT that 40 acres represented when it was announced a few hundred years and still today. You'll be surprised at how much you will enjoy this book. I know I thoroughly absorbed the tale.Phyllis, as we say down South, you put your foot in this one! Good job..."
5,It's A I Can't Put It Down Now Book,"This is a must read book. I couldn't get my work done. I keptreading until the end. It's the kind of book that you want topeep ahead to see what was going to happen. It was entertaining,enlightening, and thought provoking. I was a better person afterreading this book. It makes you reexamine your life. It makes you appreciate family and people more. You must read it for yourself.Juel J. Richardson"
3,Shane needed someone more like himself!,"I didn't like Rebecca and there was to much written about the ghosts, a little boring! Otherwise, it made me want to meet Shane and his brothers."
2,One day I will stop buying NR,"This book was 100 % mediocre. It wasn't bad, but it didn't really hold my interest. Nora Roberts needs to stick to what she does best, those long books with an atmospheric setting. Family series by her are not that good!! If only I could learn that lesson and stop wasting money."
3,Good Read,"Shane's story was my least favorite of the all the books. Read about Rafe, Jared and Devin and then see what you think of Shane's story. All are very good reads."
1,Five stars,This book like the first three were some of the best reading Ihave read in a long time. Nora Roberts keeps you guessing with each book. I thoroughly enjoy reading anything by Nora Roberts.
1,Awful,"I love Nora Roberts. I have read so many of her novels, but I just couldn't finish this one. Shane MacKade is spoiled and obnoxious who really doesn't understand the word no. Even after Rebecca tells him repeatedly that his advances are unwanted, he does it anyway because he knows she likes it and it pisses him off that she says no! To top that all off, Rebecca isn't even likable, let alone relatable. When the male character says ""we're going to have sex because I said so and you'll just have to get used that"", I have to stop. That isn't happily ever after or true love. And he definitely shouldn't be rewarded with sex. He deserved a swift slap to the face. The other three books I couldn't put down. I don't think I'll ever be able to say how disappointed I was at how awful the two main characters in this one are."
3,exciting but done before,"I expected more from this series. When I read it I realized Ms Roberts had similar characters in a similar backround, dealing with similar issues in a series that ends with ""The Perfect Hope"" . That 3 book set features the Montgomery brothers (only 3) and is set in Boonsboro NC (very close to Antitem). This character Shane MvKade could be a carbon copy of Ryder Montgomery. I love the Civil War ghosts and how they interact with the characters; however I felt the story was much better told in ""The Next Always"" and the two books following it. I am not sure which series she wrote first, but if you like this one you'll love that one"
5,Romance,I like the characters in this book. I like the the way it leads to romance. I like a book that has different characters at once.
3,More of the same,"Figured I would finish seeing what happened to the last of the MacKades.Unfortunately, it was a similar- very similar plot.Little more interest with the ""ghost""."
3,the fall of Shane McKade,The book is very well written and is wery enjoyble. I liked it very much...I will also reccomended to friends..
4,relaxing read,MacKade brothers give me a relaxing and entertaining read. Nora Roberts knows how to give you very explicit descriptions of romance.
4,The Fall of Shane MacKade,Funny and a story that moves right along. Brings you up to date on the rest of the MacKade brothers and what is happening with their families.
5,Of course...,Great series if books. Nora Robert Trilogies are always a must for me. You can never go wrong with one of her books.
4,I loved this book!,I was looking for historical fiction when I started this book and realized that it was contemporary. I read a bit and was hooked by the end of the first chapter. Shane is a down to earth person and Rebecca is so smart that she is in her head much of the time. I enjoyed watching their relationship come together. The background of the whole MacKade family made this a richer as his brothers could see what was happening to Shane even when he was not ready to admit it. The parts of the story about the ghosts was just enough for a mystery but not so much to make it unbelievable. Naturally I want to read others in this series.
5,Smiling again,"No disappointed here. I really enjoy this series. I would put it right up there with the "" Rough Riders"" series."
5,Terrific book worth reading multiple times.,"I'm reading this book for the 2nd time, and I find myself underlining more key information than the first time I read it. Now, my intermediate and advanced students are required to read this book as part of our curriculum.Kwan Jang NimChristian Academy of Martial Artswww.christianacademyofmartialarts.comkarate for christ certified school"
5,Must have for any Martial Arts Instructor,"No matter whether you have been teaching in Martial Arts your whole life or just starting to teach, this book is a must have. It is packed with information and ideas that are traditional that alot of us may have taken away in order to ""fit in"" to todays society. We need to stand together to fix society and this book is a great reminder."
5,Great book.,Great transaction. Delivered promtly and as promised. An in-depth read from very experience & knowledgeable instructors.
3,"Decent bike, great price","A sharp looking bike with a decent frame. Anyone over 5'11"" should look elsewhere. The rear hub appears to be the weak point as it already has a loose wobble. The fenders look great and protect you from road water. I've ridden about 50 miles so far.A middle aged rider"
4,"A solid, sturdy bike for cruising the flatlands","My only problem with this bike was assembly and the manual. The manual was ""one size fits all"" for anza bikes (except this one, apparently). I guess they realized this limitation and added a flyer for installing the front wheel and fender, but it wasn't much help. Eventually, I managed to get the wheel and fender installed, but a month later the bolt connecting the front fender to the frame came off. It was a minor thing. A trip to the local hardware store put me back on the road.I'd have given the bike five stars except for the poor instruction manual."
4,The good old days!,"Was this the last TS album? If so, it's pretty neat. It stands up strong to today's mediocre and somewhat prolix junk and the best part about it is you can actually understand what lead singer Dee Snider is singing about. No growling, yelling, howling, or even cursing here, just pure singing, and my favorite track is 'Hot Love'. No bull. One good album."
3,not a review but....,for you guys that do not know this....you may quote me if i am wrong....but Reb Beach from Winger played most of the guitars on this album.....
4,"Best album since ""You Can't Stop Rock and Roll""","Way more consistent than ""Stay Hungry"" (which had some great songs) and ""Come Out and Play"" (which didn't suck), it's a return to the much more fun sound of ""Can't Stop Rock and Roll."" Not only is the title track one of their best songs but the cover is one of the all-time greatest."
4,this album rocks,"This is, in my opinion, the best Twisted Sister album and I was delighted to find it for sale on Amazon. I've not had a copy for over 10 years and it still rocks my world today. This album is full of good, honest 80's rockin' fun and it's great for singing along. The riffs get stuck in your head all day. If you're new to Twisted Sister I recommend this for a first album. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,"Deserves 3 and a half stars, but I decided to go high","Some very interesting covers of some great songs by a bunch of groups I've never heard of. Ok, there are one or two tracks that I completely skip, but other than that, the other 12 definitely hold my interest."
3,Not the best choice,"I bought this book after incurring a sports injury. Although it has some useful information, I found Micheli's Sports Medicine Bible to be far superior - more depth and better information."
5,excellent first reference for sport related injury,"I've had this book for quite a while. When I get injured, particularly a leg, foot, or arm injury, I usually consult this book first to ID the injury and for recommended solutions. You may think an injury should be easily identified. Not always so. And even if you are sure of what it is, the tips provided to get over the injury (if not ""go straight to doctor"") seem to work.In the area of the knee, it could be a bit more informative. For instance one or two more diagrams to help isolate the area of injury. For instance, is this a ""compartment"" injury or something else?In general, this is a good first reference."
1,Shallow and empty female characters fill this hollow read.,"Shallow and empty female characters fill this thrown-in-a-blender mix of faerie tales. There were a few interesting uses of description and scenery, however, these small gems were few-and-far inbetween and ultimately weren't enough to be worth the ticket price. The lack of any actual thought or action on the part of the women leads, added to the utterly disgusting complacency with brutal (but crudely written) scenes such as rape, made this book a bitter disappointment. I simply couldn't tolerate the way the women had no connection to anything going on around them and how they moved through the sporatic plot mindlessly.A frustrating and ultimately hollow read."
2,Had potential and squandered it.,"In a story about Snow White, a big mistake everyone makes is, you guessed it, Snow White! They make her bland, unoriginal, and so perfect you start siding with the queen character. This book is no exception. The short stories of Jane Yolen and Abigail Rouse's books are much better. I opened it up expecting an epic full of strong women. Just because women are the main characters does not make them strong in any way. This book just seemed so bitter at men and tried to make passive-aggressive insults at them, completely ignoring Snow White."
2,Dark Fantasy Indeed,"I was disappointed and disgusted with this book. The goal of the book was to create a darker retelling of the Snow White tale. I thought the characters were completely unsympathetic, which is why I disliked it so much. If the characters were more lively maybe it could be better. For all of the violence and sex the book was strangely apathetic. Well, I now know dark fantasy is not for me."
1,"Horror, not fantasy","Having loved the previous novels in the fairy tale series, I had great hopes for this novel. I thought that using the Demeter/Persephone myth was a great idea. Unfortunately, the characters were seemed to be empty caricatures and the story much more horror than fantasy - I wish editors would stop linking the two genres."
2,A little too much for me,"OK. I must not be a fan of dark fantasy. Maybe that's my problem with this book. However, I am a fan of Terri Windling's Fairy Tale Series. I bought this book in hardcover because it was a part of the series--although the fact that it was written by Tanith Lee gave me some serious qualms.I can admire that Lee is a talented writer than can truly mine the depths of darkness to write a fantastic story. However, even while I recognized Lee's talent when reading this book, I was repelled by it. One of the professional reviews stated that she explored the sex and violence of the Grimm version of ""Snow White."" That's true. However, this book simply went too far for me. If memory serves me correctly there were at least 10 separate acts of rape. Very likely I'm underestimating that number.If you like dark fantasy and/or Tanith Lee, you'll think this book is fantastic. If you're at all squeamish about reading about rape, I recommend walking away from this novel."
1,irritating and disappointing,"I've loved several books in the Fairy Tale series, especially Tam Lin. I started reading this book ready to really enjoy it, but my assessment kept dropping as I went, and finally I put it down unfinished less than 2/3 through. The characters were completely unengaging, every relationship (and all the sex, including the stuff that was supposed to be fun) was depressing and sleazy, and the slightly adjusted mythological names were annoying (if you're going to use them, use them). I didn't care about any of the characters, and everything they did seemed like just another bit in a string of events, rather than a personally shaped life. Parts of the book seemed promising, but overall it struck me as a lengthy and pointless ordeal. I'm sorry to have liked it so little, and hope other work of Lee's is better."
1,BLAH!,"This book was an absolute waste of time. I have to agree with memoryanddreamddd and Eva-Lise's reviews, the characters were entirely without personality. They went through this story completely brain-dead...it was really abnoxious. I felt that the imagery was trite and the story line was poorly put together. I read the story hating every single character (well actually hate would involve some feeling, I should say I was completely indifferent to all the characters). More over, I hated the authors writing style. Her sentences were choppy and confusing. Practically every other sentence I had to read twice in order to simply understand what exactly was being said. After reading this book, I have no desire to ever read another Tanith Lee book again!"
2,Not a Happy Fairy Tale,"You can totally disregard my review because I admit that I did not read all of this novel I found it so disgustingly detailed that I had to put it down. This novel is NOT what I thought it to be like an ""Ella Enchanted"" or McKinley's novels it is strongly for adults not children. I am not a child but, I do not like books to cuss frequently or to tell too many details. The begining of the book astounded me and I hope that this will never fall into the hands of a child because of its content. I guess if you like overly gory and sexually explicit fantasy novels this is the one for you but, I'm a romantic and would rather have a kinda ""happily ever after"" than a ""everyone gets killed or is emotionally/mentally not ever happy after"" if you get what I mean."
3,Interesting blend of mythologies,"A dark and sensuous retelling of Snow White. It is almost worth it for the long introduction alone (almost 30 pages!) which delves deeply into the roots of the Snow White fairy tale and its variations. I liked the story for the most part, though it did drag and try too hard in some sections. Lee masterfully blends in the mythologies of Demeter and Persephone, pagan rituals, and Catholic mores to make this tale even more complex."
4,Tanith Lee is Twisted and FABULOUS,"Is this the best book you'll ever read? No, but damn is it a dark ride. LOOK OUT DISNEY! I recomend it and am surprised at how many people didn't like it. Its fun and unforgetable."
5,All necessary info,I got all necessary information and more :)I totally recommend this book if you want to know more about what's going on in Superyacht industry.
5,A lot of informations for newcomers,"Great source of informations for all people interested in a job on luxury yachts. All pros ans cons are listed. I'd like to start the cursus of captain 200 in septembre and this book will be very helpful to find the necessary first job as deckhand.Franck (Paris, France)"
4,The Wit and Wisdom of The Nanny,"If you are a Nanny fan, you'll enjoy this book. It's filled with memorable quotes from the show. Even a few photo in the book."
5,perfect for small phones,"I've had this cell phone case for two years or so and it works great for me. I have a small slider phone now and I had a small flip phone before that, and both of them fit perfectly. The clip attaches firmly to the side of my purse or my belt; it doesn't slide off except under the most extreme circumstances."
3,it works,it wasn't what i wanted the picture on the screen didn't show it justice but it does work and i do use it it might be what your looking for but it wasn't what i was loooking for .
3,all right,"The case its self is nice, feels hard so you know the phone is protected. However, I have a very small flip phone and my phone barley fits in the case, I have to jam it in and pry it out, presing several buttons along the way - that can suck if your pulling it out to answer a call. The case won't latch with my phone inside, but it has yet to fall out. Good case if your phone fits in it, but I won't be using mine much longer."
3,Does NOT hold the phone securely,"I used this mini universal foam case with the Motorola V180 and wore it on my belt. Within the first few weeks of use, my phone fell out of the case several times. As a previous reviewer has already mentioned, the case has a tendency to squeeze the phone out, and there is no cover or latch to prevent the phone from falling."
4,"Good price, among other things","Pretty good case, fits my Samsung x495 well. I've never had a problem with it falling out, but I usually keep it in my pocket or vertical and take special care to make sure it's secure. It has a hard feel, so you know your phone is protected. The metal pieces seemed somewhat sharp, but they no longer do, and has never been a problem.The only disadvantage is that you cannot open the phone while in the case or see the outer screen, which I suppose is not what you're looking for when you buy this case.BTW, the ratcheting positions DO exist, but are not really useful to me (my phone doesn't have an external antenna)."
1,Wanted Portuguese NOT Portuguese Brazil,"I ordered this product based on the title, ""Portuguese, Level 1"". When it arrived it was ""Portuguese - Brazil"", which is not at all the same language. There were other Rosetta Stone ""Portuguese - Brazil"" shown, so I had no reason to believe that regardless that it shows it as a different product, they were all the same. I was going on an important business meeting in Angola (where they speak Portuguese) and was totally unprepared. I immediately (within an hour) returned the ""wrongly advertised"" product, but over 3 weeks have passed and I have not received refund. Upon calling Rosetta Stone (because there is no way to call Amazon) they informed me that they don't make a ""Portuguese"" version, even though they acknowledge that there are several countries (including Portugal) that use that language, where the only country that uses ""Portuguese - Brazil"" is...you got it, Brazil. Misrepresented by Amazon...Limited thinking by Rosetta Stone...Unhappy customer."
4,Def. Does the job,I'm a starting DJ and these headphones have been great for my use so far. I went from using Bose over the ear headphones so the sound isn't perfect and I understand that but it does have a good bass frequency and they seem pretty sturdy. I would def. recommend.
5,Great buy,"When I saw the price, I was skeptical of the product but it serves my purpose and I take great care. The sound is good. I wish there was a feature that could let you control the individual channels. It is a great equipment for the price and my need"
2,BROKEN AFTER A YEAR,"These phones broke after a year of heavy use, poor for a product that is said to be for professional use. Sound quality is great but this does not make up for the terrible build quality.DJ IRUKANDJI > Trinidad."
1,Faults of this head phone,i am a dj and i always baby my equipment. I have had 3 pairs of these head phones and I think I will finally stop buying this head phone because it isnt really sturdy. All 3 times the head phone seemed to break at the swivel joint after a couple of months of use. Dont get me wrong the quality of the head phones is superior in my opinion just the cheap plastic parts that seem to break at the same spots is what bothers me. So far ive invested about 450 dollars in 3 headphones and that is why i am going to look for another headphone
3,"Excelente Sonido, Baja Calidad de sus Materiales.","Estos audífonos producen un excelente sonido tanto para los agudos como para los bajos, llegan a alcanzar gran volumen, la verdad son de lo mejor que he escuchado.Para mi tienen solo dos defectos, el primero y gran defecto es su calidad, para ser unos audífonos de este precio sus materiales deberían ser más fuertes y duraderos... el mismo día que me llegaron los use por varias horas y por estar colocándomelos y quitándomelos en varias oportunidades el material de los ejes se sintió y se deformo (el plástico utilizado es de pésima calidad) El segundo gran defecto es que al poco tiempo de tenerlos puestos te comienza a doler la zona donde se apoyan en las orejas (no son cómodos si superas los 10 minutos puestos y luego de unos 20 minutos el dolor hace que uno constantemente se los mueva de posición o de ángulo para poder sobrellevar el dolor que producen) aprietan demasiado en el borde de las orejas."
2,THEY BREAK!!,"Great sound, great looking and comfortable.. but they will break. So intend to buy them once a year. Like the Sonys, the plastic piece that holds the earphone on to the headset is cheap and cracks, then eventually splits in two. It's the most strained part on the headphone because it is constantly being pressured by taking them on and off. If they just use a tougher material, like aluminum, titanium or something it would solve the problem and they would be useable for a long time. I think it's the manufacturer's way to consistently get DJs to buy them again and again. I have a broken pair in front of me and am about to do battle with Pioneer to get a replacement."
4,"Great sound, until they broke.","If you are a bedroom dj, or simply a fan of music that likes high quality sound, then these are the headphones for you. The sound isolation is ideal for mixing, and they are very comfortable. However, they do not hold up to the wear and tear of regular dj'ing. There is a lot of manipulation of headphones when it comes to mixing, and these headphones just couldn't handle it. I would constantly have to adjust in the middle of a set because the slider on the right was wearing out. Today I went to put them on, and the right earpiece broke off. I don't think it's simply a matter of taking care of them, or handling them properly. I'm looking at getting the HDJ-2000 to replace these, hopefully the magnesium alloy reinforcements will prevent the problems I've had with the HDJ-1000."
3,Great sound quality but shoddy construction,Like other posters have said Great sound quality but poor construction and will fall apart after a year. I had mine for roughly a year and the part where the headphone connects to the headband broke the padding on the can s was also cracking. I however loved the sound quality and I am considering buying more just because of that if they fixed the issue of the breaking with better construction of metal or stronger plastic I would buy again.
5,EXCELENTE,ME ENCANTANRON MIS AURICULARES. MUY BUENO SONIDO Y COMODOS PARA LOS OIDOS. EL CABLE ES LARGO IDEAL PARA PONER MUSICA
3,"Decent, but Audio Technica ATH-M50 Better Value at this Price Point","I bought these headphones because I was looking for exceptional audio quality and appreciate the Pioneer brand. I must admit that these headphones do sound impressive. The only problems I see are comfort and durability. The muffs sit on your rather than around it which leads to discomfort after prolonged use. As for the durability, many people have claimed that these break easily and I would agree. While mine haven't broken yet (I just received them recently), the construction is entirely plastic and feels cheap. They even used plastic on high-wear areas like the ball joints.Pros:-Great audio qualityCons:-Plastic construction-Uncomfortable (Muffs sit on the ear rather than around it)At this price point, I would have to recommend theAudio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphonesinstead. They're more comfortable, have better construction and have great audio as well."
2,They break and dont have any depth,"These say they have a huge range per their specs but I dont buy it. I have a pair and they broke on the right can because of my big head sound still works but they are junk. I have a new pair of headphones but I wont say what they are in this review but they are like night and day. I used Tangerine Dream, Legend soundtrack to do a compare. Pioneers lost bigtime. Using my laptop as a driver I now have another 3500mw max set of cans and they are amazing when compared against the old Pioneers. The Pioneers were quiet and I had my ears in the cans even pulled out the Tip a bit no deal on the louder sound I am getting from my new set. Dont waste your cash on this plastic made in china unless you like hearing less."
5,Natural Healing Product,"I LOVE this product! I use it for just about everything from a spider bite, cuts, ear infection, flush the eyes or a sore throat...you name it. I always try Colloidal Silver first before I decide to call our vets or I go to the Dr. for myself-and 99% of the time this product works on the issue. Stacey at CaliforniaStandardPoodle.com"
5,AWESOME for healing!!,"I love colloidal zilver, it is a miracle worker to heal cuts quickly. I have even used a few drops on my face where some acne breakouts formed a bit of a cut. I feel that it healed those irritations very very nicely. This price is the best around!"
1,Beware,"This product can cause seizures and sure did for me. So, read warnings of this product before taking. I'm not sure if it was this brand or product in general. Careful giving to animals as well."
4,Great healing tonic,I use this for all sorts of things--couple drops in dogs water helps clear up bad breath for one! It is great to have on hand.
5,Through the eyes of a zentrepeneur,"This book is very enlightening for those who are thinking of starting their own business, or who own their own business. It is also a generally useful book for anyone who seeks to improve their life. The authors aren't afraid to share personal triumphs and failures. The book is easy to read and entertaining. It is an inspirational guide that I will personally refer to for both life and business ventures."
3,3 stars,"This book is one that I did actually enjoy reading and that is saying quite a bit for me because I don't typically like to read. The book takes you on a journey that leaves you charged to take up your own dreams and do something with them. This is a book of action. My only withdrawl of the book is the use of the lord's name in vain. I think a reflective book of this sort could do without that language. But looking past that language, one finds some very useful insights."
4,Chapters 7 - 9 are best!,"A fun book to read, but move slow until chapters 7 - 9. These chapters were very thought provoking and motivational for me. These three chapters are worth the price of the book.Also contains an excellent ""recommended reading list"" in the back of the book."
3,A light read with inspiration but lacking depth,"This is a good book for a quick pep talk. For anyone who has read other books on Zen, you'll find this book lacking depth. It's a short book and I don't believe the authors' intention was to explore Zen, but rather introduce their concept of Zen in simple to understand concepts. In that case, they have succeeded. They include a good list of suggested readings, but I was disappointed that none of Wayne Dyer's were among them. I think he explores the same issues that Zen tackles but with lots of practical insight."
1,Not so much,In my opinion this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I would have liked to keep that tree alive instead.
4,Gulp!,"Great, easy read. The authors' passion is obvious and the book articulates well how your attitude is critical to catching and living your dream. You have the ability to change your destiny and this book will give you the motivation to take that step."
4,Success@Life Review,Success @ Life was eye-opening in that it encouraged me to find a way to create the life that I dream about. The book contains much good information and is very easy to read. The appeal of Success @ Life lies in the honesty that the authors convey about the successes and failures that one can expect in an entrepreneurial pursuit.
5,"Rubin & Gold, Ministers of the Republic of Tea","""Success @ Life"" is a powerful motivational tool, with a ""matter-of-fact"" style of writing makes it a pleasure to read. The book does not cover the traditional areas of business - marketing, finance, accounting, etc. But it rather deals with what it is that separates successful people from the rest. This is a book of action. This is an excellent, short and concise, to-the-point book that motivates us to follow our dreams. It's a jump-start for your stalled spirit. Whether you believe in the Zen or not, you should read the ""Success @ Life"". It does show that though reaching for your dream is hard work, it will also be fun, rewarding, and revealing."
4,Sip by sip!,"I am a man from latitude 105 degree east and equator intercepted. Largest communist country in the North and Totalitarian in the South. Since I have a chance to read this book it is totally against my belives.But after a couple of chapters I realized that, this is true life? You have to pick the part you like and throw away one that you don't like. Book told me that you have to consider every pieces in life and hold on to the the useful items. Let's them inspire you, give you your wills to go on."
4,A Inspirational Kick in the Rear,"This book is great for those aspiring entrepreneurs who are waiting to be inspired into action. It is a highly motivating book with concrete advice on how to find a mentor and make the relationship work to furthur your growth. Also, in the book's favor is that it is an incredibly fast read. Buy this book and you won't be disappointed. Now, only if we could all work for The Republic of Tea."
1,What is the sound of one reader snoring?,"Adds nothing to the ""follow your dream"" genre except the self-intoxicated ramblings of a couple of glorified salesmen.""That's not writing, that's typing.""--Truman Capote"
1,Rubin's Unethical Praise,"Take off your shoes, get out your hooka and get ready for some ""fungscheau..blah..blah..blah.""Ron Rubin explores his fantasy concept about turning your work into a way of life; although I am all for finding your passion. Being such a free-spirited type, I'm surprised Rubin didn't mind wasting so much paper and ink talking about ""Zentrepreneurial"" idealism. To enjoy this one, you better like tie-dyes and VW vans.""sip by sip""....yeah, drink up!"
5,THE BEST ADVICE,"Success At Life is the best motivational business/life book I have come across. As a follower of Tony Robbins personal power dictums, I found Rubin and Gold's philosophies and experiences to be more real world and authentic. This is a book for realists that does away with the usual self-help babble presenting instead a hip, witty style that provides you with a want to and will do attitude for success. The book's underlying message is that we all need to learn how to enjoy the journey-Success At Life it is a great ride."
3,Always a buffalo fan,"I own may Buffalo's products. This one is a fine one, still working well after over a year conituous use - back up drive."
4,"A good starting point, for a Generic Fantasy world","GURPS Fantasy is good place to start a campaign, if the GM lacks the time or talent to build a world from scratch. There's enough detail to provide a lot of room for campaigns with a lot of different 'flavors'.The background material can be used to generate adventure seeds, and make the world seem more ""real"" to the players.For those that don't want a generic ""high fantasy"" setting, this might not work. It does have some nice twists - like Goblins being a viable character race, not a ""cannon fodder"" monster."
3,Wish I knew,"I give this 3 stars because I've had this unit for almost 2 weeks now and still don't know if I can make a movie on it that is readable on a regular DVD player. I made an entire movie using Intervideo only to learn that it doesn't support this or any other Alera units. (I always thought drivers prevented this?) Anyway, the only software that seems to work with it is Ulead, the software bundled with it and the version sent won't do much. (For example, play background music across videos and stills) So I tried to buy the Ulead upgrade only to find that their web site ordering system is pretty useless. After speaking with VISA I found out that my order had been approved only to be sent back by Ulead as rejected???? So I still don't know if I can make the movie I want to make. If I were to do it again, I'd by something compatible with Intervideo."
4,1st Eden of the East Movie Review,"I was skeptical that the first movie would be as good as the series, but the thrills and plot twists were abundent in this film. The story begins in New York and begins right after the events of the series. Being said, those who are not familiar with the series might have a little trouble with the plot and characters. All of the favorite surviving characters were in the film, creating a wide array of diversity and conflict. The animation was stunning and colorful; it was obvious much effort was put into the background of the environments. The English (dubbed) version was well done and did not sound like an emotionless script reading. This series is a must see for anime and conspiracy film fans."
3,This is in bad need of a conclusion,"This movie picks up where the first left off. We start to see the plans of the other selacao put into motion. Although this film is good, it has a very disappointing ending. Actually it has no ending. This anime just freakin stops. Just like His and Her Circumstances, Tsubasa, Spiral, and my beloved Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I want to sing praises for Eden of the East. I loved the series; but if this is it, they may as well have not made it at all. That's my only complaint. Everything about this anime is great. It just needs to be finished very badly."
3,Plays like a neverending episode,"This was so boring. It was like someone took the least interesting lost episode of eden of the east and stretched it out. I couldn't pull my eyes away from the tv series but I found myself opening up my laptop and staring into space sometimes because this was just bad. Like someone else mentioned, this is on netflix so save the money and just watch it there. I really wish I hadn't bought the dvd and instead had just went out and bought the show.Spoilers at this point!!! I really hated how Takizawa lost his memory again...it was like deja vu. He drives the show forward yet Saki and the crew were off boring us to death along the way. Panties was back for some occasional sassy dialogue but really I wanted to hit fast forward everytime they paused then rambled then paused...In short---Save you're money."
3,"Loved the series, a little disappointed in this, though I want to see what happens next","I thoroughly enjoy the series. The blu-ray quality is very good (I compared the colors and pq to netflix online, and it is definitely better on blu-ray). However this film is basically a longer episode with a strange end - it's not even an end, it just stops. I found the story intriguing and just when it got interested, it ended. I suppose I will have to wait for paradise lost, but I felt that this was not the price of a whole movie but rather ""two episodes""."
5,It was good.,I don't know what most of these people are talking about.I really enjoyed the movie and there were funny parts toostuff DID happen in this movie important things.
4,Pretty good,The trailer for the movie is more exciting than the movie itself. I think this movie and its sequel should have been released together in a combo-pack. Now I have to wait for the next one to be released...ugh. Go Air King!!
4,Only partially successful,"Like many reunions, this one is only partially successful. The writing, both lyrics and music, is just as strong as it was during Procol Harum's heyday. However, there are no really great Robin Trower guitar solos like there were then. Remember ""Repent, Walpurgis""? Brooker's piano is still great, as is his wonderful blues voice. Keith Reid is still one of the finest, if not the finest, rock lyricist. The overall impression, at least to me, is that there is just something missing. I bought the CD, and I still play it often, but it does not measure up to ""Salty Dog"" or ""Grand Hotel"". I do recommend it, but only if you already have their first 4 or 5 CDs and ""Grand Hotel"". It's good, but it could have been so much better."
1,My review is highly unfavorable.,"I was very disappointed in this book. Very little of its content was devoted to discussion of running a used book shop. Most of it was general information on starting a business with the words ""used bookstore business"" inserted regularly, as in form letters which insert a person's name. Some of it was geared to new book businesses, discussing ordering from publishers, etc. One and a half pages were specifically about used book stores. The last chapter in the book was titled ""Secondhand and Antiquarian."" I have never been more disappointed in a book."
4,Compelling,"This biography of a great, adorable, sexy, and tragically flawed scientist is as dramatic as it is thorough and well narrated. As is to be expected of a good biography, the thread of the story is everywhere composed of two kinds of detail, scientific and personal, and at any point you can easily skim over the one if you prefer the other. The author has given very little room to Heisenberg's postwar life, which is why I did not give him the five-star rating. But I thank him for a job well done."
3,"""Uncertainty"" aptly describes the value of this book.","This book is surprisingly uninvolving, given the fascinating and highly provocative subject matter. The writing is uninspired and dry. I cannot recommend this as the definitive biography of Heisenberg."
5,Like a Hot Cup of Tea,"I just loved this book. How comforting it is to read of women who have a heart, who really love their kids - despite the fatigue, the relentless grind, and the reality of not-so-helpful partners. Helen Simpson is deliciously English - I love the way her female characters will declare, ""I'm shattered.""There is a genre of ""mommy lit"" currently available that strikes me as being not only cold and heartless, but badly written and not particularly intelligent.These stories are anything but - I do hope Ms.Simpson hurries up and writes another book."
4,Very Involved,"Ms. Simpson writes with a lot of passion. Her short stories are filled with real life complications, not in the writing but in the nature of each story. The longest is ""Getting a Life"" which is a woman's struggle with her everyday life taking care of a husband, her kids, and the chores around the house and outside. Ms. Simpson ends the collection with another short about the same family. As a writer, Ms. Simpson captures the gist of troubles faced by various generations of individuals and puts them down on paper effectively."
4,"Moms, read this book!","This book is a must-read for young to mid-life moms! I strongly identified with many of the women in the stories, having been through two toddler boys (now 10 and 13 years). Simpson is a fabulous, crafty writer. Thoroughly enjoyed it all."
1,Bleak,"This book looks great, and Simpson is not a bad writer. But these stories seem to have no point, and she makes motherhood, wifehood, hell LIFE, sound terrible and pointless. Read this book if you are on the fence about having kids or getting married, and you probably won't do either. A total downer, especially the stories about the too-expensive-for-life boutique and the tale about a woman's husband who has, let's say, ""an incident"" aboard a plane."
4,A Texas mystery,"Rebeccasreads recommends GHOST OF A CHANCE as an interesting, atmospheric mystery set in a Texas backwater tourist trap under the grip of the Invisible Nation.Oklahoma City PI Buck McDivit has grown up in foster homes & after years of hunting for other people's relatives, he decides to research his own family. Upon discovering he has an aunt & that she has recently died under mysterious circumstances, he comes to Deception to find out more, & take a look at the land she owned.What he uncovers is a crime & a countywide conspiracy. Who he meets is a beautiful archeologist in search of a sunken riverboat filled with Confederate gold, & the ghost of a girl murdered over a century ago."
2,not good,"This book represents a pipedream of Skousen, that somehow we should all be living today under Mosaic law.The book is filled with some true oddities - such as British Israelism - the belief that the Anglo Saxons were one of the lost tribes of Israel. Skousen then smears St. Augustine of Hippo - blaming him for the division of Christianity. He lambastes Alexander Hamilton - almost to being a criminal.Skousen's scholarship is poor at best; he will make statements and ""support"" them with quotes that are out of context or completely wrong.Some chapters are based almost entirely from a single source; one chapter - on the revolutionary war - is completely without reference (and filled with numerous factual errors.)Finally, Skousen suggest we may be lucky enough to undergo a ""cleansing"" that will lead to the loss of numerous lives, and eventually allow the dawning of ""God's Law"" - and the establishment of an agrarian society. Like it or leave it.I can not recommend this book."
3,interesting but disappointing,"I am an avid Ghosthunters fan (TAPS on SciFi). I purchased this book hoping it would give me specifics about paranormal investigations/haunted locations in Illinois. The book is interesting in that it provides several locations that are reputed to be haunted. However, it is more disappointing in that the book offers no evidence of any investigations or ""hunts"". In every site story that I have read so far, I see a lot of the word ""maybe"" and or ""perhaps"". The author has clearly visited the sites, but has not had any personal experiences himself to build on -- he merely repeats stories he has heard from locals.I would like to have seen something more from this book -- but it does still make me curious."
4,interesting,"If you live in Chicagoland, this book has quite a few interesting places to visit. Just don't expect to actually see any ghosts!"
2,A ghost-hunting guide without the ghosts,"This guide details the author's travels to various ""haunted"" locations. Once there, the location is described in detail along with any ""gossip"" that people have to say about ghosts. Sometimes locations aren't even described but pages are detailed on the ""ghost"" haunting it (i.e. the re-telling of the Dillinger tale). Very rarely does the author try to find the source of the ""hauntings"" or perform any type of investigation whatsoever. I guess if you're looking for a travel guide that details places that may or may not be haunted and you like listening to ""ghost stories"" that may or may not be true then this is great. Personally I was hoping that the author would get more involved at each location and try to understand who or what might be haunting them, if anything."
2,Should have stopped at Season 1,"Too Bad there was a SEASON 2. Though, if you watched Season 1, Season 2 is worth it just to wrap up some loose ends and get some more sexy scenes.Season 2 has changed locations, changed some characters, added some unnecessary characters and created a terrible DVD menu. The location change is the most egregious problem, besides just plain ol' bad acting. But who is watching the acting anyway. So, the location change completely changes the feel of Dante's Cove. It looks like someones house, up in Palos Verdes, rather than a seaside resort hotel in some old part of Key West. bugged me for the entire second season.Hotties, hotties and more hotties. Like I said, it's not good, but if you watched Season 1, you need to get Season 2. Just because."
3,dantes cove season 2 review,the new male characters are not that hot or exciting as season one. it would have been better if the original cast members were still performing.glad that there are more characters to add to the story.thea is a great addition to the cast.the plot is simple but enjoyable. the music is great and would like to see it on a cd.looking forward to season three. if anyone is interested in starting a fan club email me. thanks
1,How Did it All Begin?,"I wish I knew how this series begins, but since disc one of Season One isdefective, I'm at a complete loss. This is the reason I've given it thelowest rating. Whenever I attempt to play the disc in question, a messageappears on screen stating that it ""...is a previously viewed disc."" Thequestion of who previously viewed it is beyond me, since I removed it from afactory-sealed jewel case). To make matters worse, whenever I attempt torestart the disc at the beginning or from where it ""left off,"" it freezesand refuses to resume playing. Curiously, the other disc in the Season Onecase and the two in Season Two work perfectly."
4,"a guilty pleasure, certainly, but a pleasure nonetheless","This really is ""Melrose Place"" meets ""Dark Shadows"" meets ""Queer as Folk"". It's an indie soap opera with an interesting plot. The acting, well, it goes over-the-top in classic camp fashion, but it works. I do agree with one prior reviewer, the sex and drug plot wasn't the greatest, hopefully it gets developed next season, but it did seem an easy way to get Adam out of the closet. This isn't as raunchy as QAF, but it's also not as developed (hey, about 60 eps verus what, 7 hours tops so far?). It's a fun show. Certainly it's better queer fare than ""Adam and Steve"" or ""Eating Out""."
4,2nd not as good - and I wish there were outtakes,"Season One had quite a few hot Toby/Kevin scenes set to some great music -there was a lot of feeling, sensuousness and heat. Season 2 has almost none of that - and the sex club is boring. Still worth having, but a disappointment.During the commentaries, the producer mentioned a great little take-off on the American Idol judges by the actors (Charlie D., Nadine H. and Gregory M.), and that he hoped he'd make it on the dvd as an outtake, but no outtakes, no bloopers are to be found on the disk! Maybe next time..."
3,Dante's cove review,"Considering the low price, I was just curious what this DVD was like. I was somewhat disappointed here. Plot and acting as well as camera work was barely acceptable. Again, the low price made the purchase okay!!"
1,I bought season 1 so had to get season 2,"If you read the review I did on season 1 nothing has changed with season 2. The acting and plot is just as terrible as season 1, if there are any other season I will not be buying them."
5,love this one,very good film with a lot of drama and mystery and some good and bad endings...full of suspence
4,A guilty pleasure chock-full of eye candy,"I bought this DVD soley based on customer reviews of the first ""season"" (if you can call 3-5 episodes that) and word of mouth. I have yet to see the first ""season""...but this one didn't give much to complain, to be honest. I loved the supernatural element, the crazy plotline; hell, it reminded me of Passions! A gay version of Charmed is what it is, when you think about it. Plenty of physical beauty to go around, the acting is what leaves much to be desired. I wanted MORE! :D"
3,Dante's Cove - 2nd Season,I really enjoyed what I could watch. The 1st DVDs in both the 1st Season and the 2nd Season would not play in either of my DVD players.
3,"The Medieval Warhorse: Origin, Development and Redevelopment","While some of Davies information is accurate, and his facts are interesting (for example Richard I capturing 200 horses from a battle, most of them wearing armor), his theory and discussion of the ""great horse"" and size does not hold water. He mentions that the warhorse grew up to 18 hands, and has no good facts to back this up, and there has been research since to prove his theories wrong. Definately worth the read, but must be taken with a few grains (or shaker) of salt."
4,If you like bridges...,"It is easy to take for granted the grandeur of the Golden Gate Bridge. This book does an excellent job of detailing out the ""end to end"" process involved in creating this marvel as well as illustrating the glamour of it."
4,It's Ok,"The only song i like on this CD is: ""Shake Yourself Loose"" Feat. Tim Bowman. I have this on my I-pod and i kept hitting the rewind button all day."
5,Great CD,"I really enjoyed the CD. I truly believe that if you purchase the CD you will definitely love it. I also liked the CD, since it seemed like Vickie Winans has a song for every special occassion. I really liked the songs. God Bless You."
4,Lots of insight,Excellent book. Well written and full of insight. Few have the depth and breadth of knowledge that Latell demonstrates in this book.
3,historical wrong information,"After Fidel is a good book with some new information abour RaulCastro, althought the books seems more about Fidel than about Raul.I also noticed two wrong informations in the books, in page138 he establish that General Alberto Bayo was a foreigner, which is wrong Alberto Bayo was cuban born althought he was a general in the Spanish Civil War, also he establish that the poem 'Cuba and Puerto Rico TWO WINGS OF THE SAME BIRD' on page 23,was composed by Jose Marti, which is wrong this poem was composed by puertorican woman poet Lola Rodriguez Tio"
2,"A good book, but it only offers a very general overview.","This book offers a very limited look at most ski resorts in the United States that offer mountain biking. The author apparently did not visit the resorts, but only sent them a survey."
5,Very happy,The book made our mountain biking trip planning very easy. It is a very useful guide to the ski resorts and what they have to offer.
1,A Terrible Product,"The problem with this light is that the motion sensor is very poor.To get any decent reading on human movement, the sensitivity has to be set to a high level. However, by doing so, the light is also triggered by small insects. As a result, the light is practically always on. If the motion sensitivity is reduced to a point where insects no longer trigger the light, the light also no longer responds to human movement.A completely worthless product. You might as well purchase a regular dusk to dawn floodlight."
5,"For the trilogy, five stars","Some years ago this was the first time I read Cherryh. She is still a bit raw around the edges in this series, and some bits don't hang together as well as they ought, but I rate the series in the first 50 of the 100 best sci-fi/fantasy books. For any fan of sci-fi, space adventure, fantasy - this is a must read. It shows all the promise later to be fulfilled in her space opera series, and yet is so full of energy, it surpasses them. Don't hang around for it to go out of print, get it now. You won't be disappointed."
2,Should Not Be a Stand-Alone Book,"If something had actually happened, I'm sure it would have been a great book. Well, I'm probably exaggerating a bit. But, for the first 170 pages of this 250 page book, absolutely nothing happens. It's essentially the background social, political, and military information of all the major players. Around page 170 and for the next 80 pages, lots of really interesting things happen. Unfortunately, they don't really end. This book is merely the prologue for its sequels. I have no problem with book trilogies. But, there has to be SOME kind of closure in each of the books. This book just gets going and then stops. Highly frustrating."
2,Item received broken,"Item was shipped within a couple of days, but was poorly packaged. The cardboard carton had a hole in it on one side and it was slightly crushed on the other side. The product was broken at the neck and the finish was also blemished."
1,a waste of money,this guitar cracked on the sides when it was tuned by a expert who has 5 guitars. apparently it is made so cheaply that it couldnt stand the pressure of being tuned. austin bazaar sells a blue one which got the same type of review i am giving. but the worst thing of all is I contacted Austin Bazaar about this issue and they didn't even have the courtesy to respond to my email. you are taking chances if you buy from them......
1,INCOMPLETE,"This is NOT a complete recording of the Chichester Psalms. I downloaded it for the Chichester Psalms, and the ""Chichester Psalms"" track is nowhere near the length of the full three-movement piece. I love, love, love Bernstein but am annoyed that the title is incomplete and misleading."
3,This wasn't the melodic Bernstein I love from his musicals,"I ordered the Kaddish and Chichester Psalms without having heard them. The Kaddish is powerful but not a piece I could hear as background music, since the spoken vocal is persistent throughout the recording. I've heard the Chichester Psalms several times but I'm not crazy about them."
4,ChichesterPsalms-A choral work or an orchestral work?,"Although at first listen this piece is full of screeching and wailing, it is definitively Bernstein. The syncopated rhythms, odd time signatures, nods to American popular, blues and jazz idioms, as well as the explosive dynamics of this piece make it a fascinating listen. WHat I didn't like about this particular recording, led by the Maestro himself, is that one cannot understand much of the text. It is mushily inarticulated. The orchestra, however, is superb, especially the percussion, and the dynamics on this recording are well differentiated. The boy soprano in the 2nd movement(emulating boy David with his harp)sings gorgeously, but one can't understand a word of the Hebrew text of the 23rd Psalm, too bad.If only Bernstein had paid as much attention to the choir as he did to the orchestra, this would be a fabulous recording of a distinctive work."
3,"""With these lips? You've got to be kidding!""","This pleasant episode of the Australian TV series ""Snowy River"" (no relation to the popular film) was the first to feature Hugh Jackman as Duncan Jones, a sailor returning home to Paterson's Ridge after a long absence. He signs on as a hired hand with the McGregors, although his old friend Rob McGregor (played by Guy Pierce) is driving cattle in Queensland.Also in this episode, Matt McGregor enters a grueling horse race to save his nephew from being taunted by other children, and the McGregor's cook quits, forcing Dennie to take over the household. Hilarity ensues.An average outing for a mildly entertaining series, notable only for the appearance of Jackman (who is riveting as always).GRADE: B-"
5,Excellent memories,"Excellent memories when they work in dual channel, I have mobo intel DG965SS, with a processor Core 2 duo of 2 GB bus 800 mhz and is incredible the speed that it is appraised with the programs and games."
2,Mealy,"They're edible, but they've got that 1970's health food store kind of mealy stale taste. There are plenty of competing products which are tastier and still made of 100% natural organic ingredients with no added sugar. The manufacturer seems to have spent millions of bucks on an expensive and annoying marketing campaign which glosses over the fact that there are better, tastier options out there. Try the fruit leather from Trader Joe's, or the really good Clif Kids fruit ropes instead."
4,Awesome,"This product has a funny taste on the first bight (if you're used to processed or artificial food) but then you sink in. They're incredibly filling, only have 40 calories, and you can carry them anywhere. A truly awesome product."
3,freshness in question,"I have often bought this product my local grocery store or Target. When I received these from Amazon the Smooshed Fruits were very tough, so much so that my son who normally loves these snacks wouldn't eat them. I hope that it was just this shipment that may have been out of date althought the freshness date on the package didn't indicate so."
2,Mediocre,"These are reasonably tasty, but the texture is the typical ""leather"" that makes it hard to bite and chew. I wouldn't recommend these for children under 4 years of age."
4,Not your typical Celtica,"I have maybe fifty Celtic cds. If I lost this one, I would surely replace it. It is very authentic Celtic (Irish), but if you are into popular Celtic music (such as Enya) or traditional Celtic folk music (such as Golden Bough or Julia Fowlis), this may not speak to you. However, if you want to look deep into the Celtic soul, this is perfect. Ancient, mystical, primal - it may miss you or it may speak to you deeply. My guess is that the more spiritual you are, the more it will speak to you - but that's just a guess. My biggest complaint is that it is sung in Gaelic with no English translation provided, though there are notes giving you the gest of every song. It should also be noted that though these songs are (rightly) billed as ""mystical"", there is no overt spirituality in most of them - they are spiritual the same way the Song of Solomon is - though they are not mostly erotic."
4,Soothing Goodness,Great Cd. Beautiful. You can hear the centuries soaring past as you listen to her lilting voice and vocal ornaments of the old days. Great for relaxation or contemplation.
3,Decent tales; shortcomings as a reference,"This book does a nice job of combining illustrations, general facts, short folk tales, and longer tales. Though it provides a great number of examples of fairy and elf tales from around the world (mostly European, of course) it does NOT provide useful tables or lists of names for similar creatures. Also, the book does not give meaningful overviews or summaries comparing and contrasting tales from different cultures.It's part of a beautiful series from Time-Life books but is not a complete reference source."
5,Memorably crafted verses explore a diversity of issues,"Guts is Catherine May's debut collection showcasing her undeniable talents as a poetry. Her memorably crafted verses explore a diversity of issues ranging from gender and class to ethnicity and the human condition. SummerSong: Grandma's been dying for weeks and weeks./You can see drying eyes and she even speaks/with a tone in her voice that is close to dead./But she doesn't know it. She's out of her head/with dry skin and tumors and her Medicaid/and memories like movies of much better days./So she rests on the couch and complains of the cold,/says ""A chill in the bones is the curse of the old,""/as her head slowly rocks in my shaky embrace,/only twitches of life still remain in her face."
5,Perfect for Those Wanting to Build a House!,"My husband and I are in the process of building our first home and we were being overwhelmed by everything going on. We had purchased several other books on building a home, but they were detailed, ""how to"" build a house books. What we needed was a book that would help us through the process of building when you were working with a builder. This book was excellent!We actually bought two copies and read it together. It provided insight into the process of hiring a builder, obtaining financing, working within your budget, and assessing whether various options were worth it or not. In addition, the book includes examples and advice from experts in the field.This book is perfect for anyone wanting to build a house!"
5,Fantastic chocolate for kids and adults.,Every kid in the Uk knows what these are. They are often the first chocolate that a infant will try after the white chocolate version. They are milk chocolate drops of the same milk chocolate as the normal Cadburys Milk Chocolate Bar. The packets are just the right size and shouldn't spoil an appetite.
1,Disappointed,I'm not disappointed in the product. I love cadbury's chocolates. I was disappointed in the size of the product. I received this product from England and it was 4 times as big. The one received was neither worth the price or shipment cost. My fault should have checked the size.
1,SAMPLE SIZE!,"This is pathetic! It's so small, like a sample you would get! It's a very misleading advertisement! It also took FOREVER to get here, a few weeks! Don't waste your money! If I could give it ZERO stars, I would! I've bought a lot, here on Amazon and I must say, this is the WORST product that I've ever received! Save your money, don't purchase these!"
5,My Favorite from Dorothy Garlock!,"This book is one of my all time favorites.I have reread it many times. The characters engaged me immediately. Because my family farmed in Missouri, the setting of 1880's Iowa captured my imagination. I like that Mrs. Garlock uses characters who have real life afflictions and the main characters have to cope with them; in this book it is mental illness, mental retardation, and teenage rebellion. I also like how the hero has his own personal issues to overcome and is not just the savior for the heroine. The warmth of family life is here too. If you like Dorothy Garlock's books, this will become one of your favorites too."
3,Family relationships - wow!,"I can't say this is a pleasant book to read, but I admire the work in it. It deals with people who are part of a very dysfunctional family and others who are thrown in with them.After misunderstandings Anna travels to take care of her ailing stepdaughter and receives a stunning, cold ""welcome"". She also acquires an infant to take care of.I take issue with the speed with which the main male character makes changes in his own thinking. Those changes are good to see, but seem to be unrealistically fast and easy.Nevertheless, I was ordering several more Garlock books yesterday. This one is definitely worth reading, but tried my patience. I have liked others of her books better. To each his own, I guess."
4,Better than expected,"After reading the other reviews, I was a little concerned in ordering the cookware. I was pleasantly surprised.The surface is not exactly as smooth as the previous set of Revereware I owned, but all in all, the cookware was well worth the money."
5,Very Good cookware!,"The cookware is wonderful! The pots and pans came quicker than expected. Also, they are just what we asked for. My husband loves the stainless steel so much better than the non-stick surface.What a great buy!"
1,Consider a different brand,"First, I recommend not buying cookware on-line unless you are familiar with the product. Go to a department or cooking store and judge the quality for yourself.This Revere set is quite light weight (very thin stainless steel) with what appears to be a micro-spray of cooper coating on the bottom. In my mind, this does not qualify it as being ""cooper clad.""The product description is misleading and you'll be disappointed if you order this set based on the official description. You can go to walmart and buy a set of similar quality for half the price.After returning this Revere set to Amazon, we went to a department sore and got a very beautiful, durable set of Emeril Cookware for a bit more money. But the *TRUE* quality is worth it."
5,An Heirloom? I say yes.,"When I moved into my first apartment 18 years ago, my Grandmother gave me one of her copper-clad Revere Ware 2 quart saucepans. That pan survived my early attempts at cooking, later survived my husband's attempt at making popcorn (literally setting the pan on fire) and yet still reliably cooks my family meal every night. Over the years I have received many a teflon coated pan but nothing...and I mean nothing...has held up like my Revere Ware. I have added to my set which now numbers about fifteen pieces. When I burn something a little steel wool cleans it right off. Dishwasher? No problem. I never thought I would consider that pan an heirloom when I first received it...but, with these copper clad, even heating, sturdy pans...you can't go wrong."
1,Not like they used to be....,"I returned the set, it was not the quality of the Revere Ware I'm accustomed to. I have some Revere Ware that is 30+ years old and it's night and day to this new stuff. I instead purchased a used older set at auction, which was cheaper and is heavier and much higher quality and made in the USA, not Indonesia as the new set was. Disappointing too, that I had to pay shipping both ways, as they back-charge you the shipping for the initial ""free shipping"" as well as the return shipping."
1,even beginners can do better,"This is what can only be generously described as 'high-end' starter cookware.'I know. I had it.And gradually bought other cheap pots and pans to cover up its flaws until I could afford some high$$$ lifetime cookware. I couldn't understand why so many things scorched and burned when following the recipe exactly 'til I upgraded.Now I know.If you enjoy the wonderful, satisfying creative process that is cooking in your kitchen, please, keep looking. Save up for the good stuff and know paying for quality up front will pay you - and your dinner guests - back so much more over time.Check out Consumer Reports, if you don't want to take my word for it.PS, This goes for knives too!"
1,The US-made Revereware = 5+ STARS,"I've had a 'starter' set of 9 pieces of Revereware copper-bottoms(made in US) for over 30 YEARS! It's been a great product. Now i'm replacing it, having given the set to someone starting out. Wish i had kept it, and given something else. (sigh). After reading the other reviews of the current product (made in INDONESIA), it's NOT the same quality. Reviewers say it dents, bends too easily. I won't waste my money on any of their (Reverware)products. If you have an heirloom piece, keep it. Wish I had. Now, I read lots more reviews (while eating tv dinners, fast food, take-out) looking for quality cookware."
4,Happy with purchase,"This is a great set. You get a lot of cookware for a decent price. Revere Ware lasts, this was to add on to a set my mother bought me when I moved into my first apartment 10 years ago. The only diffence between my original set and the new one, my origianl set was made in Ohio, now they manufacture in Asia. The metal is a little thiner and lighter, but all in all I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this set to any person looking for a quality cookware set that isn't 'non-stick'."
3,Fair,"Mr. Houarner can write fairly well, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as I expected to enjoy it. I expected a 4-star book.The last two stories about Jeloc were fine and I might have given the book that rating if all were like them. However, the rest of the book just seemed to incarnate ""life sucks and then you die."" Some books are grim but the power of the writing keeps you enthralled. Some are grim but you have a sense of moral satisfaction or completeness. Some are grim in part, but are relieved by the other side of the coin in places. This was just grim."
3,Disappointing quality,Beware! The 2002 paperback edition of this title is printed on very poor quality paper with a binding typical of mass market paperbacks--not what one would normally expect from Oxford University Press.
3,Hmmm...,"This book is a bit disjointed because each chapter is written by a different author. So, it doesn't flow as easily as it could. Also, some of the authors go on and on about their particular topic of interest. For example,there is an entire chapter on Greek drama that is nearly 40 pages long. A chapter on Greek art and architecture that is 34 pages long. For me, this was too much. It may be right for you, though. Ancient Greece by Thomas Martin was a better read and had more of what I was looking for in a history book on ancient Greece."
5,Contemporary Jazz Artist,"I am an avid collector of contemporary jazz music since the '80's to present, and it is my passion to look for new artists similar to what you say to be the golden years of contemporary jazz with the likes of Sax Artists such as Grover Washington, Ronnie Laws, Spyro Gyra in the '80's and Nelson Rangell or Paul Taylor, Jeff Kashiwa in the '90's. This is one guy that I chanced upon previewing through amazon and Dee Lucas fits with what I was looking for. For me, music done by these artists are hard to come by nowadays. It's my very first time to buy his album, and I'm definitely looking forward to his upcoming albums."
3,"Good stuff, except for Bolero.","This is very good playing, except for the Bolero, which is sub-standard. There are places in Bolero where the ensemble is out of sync, and where the woodwinds are woefully out-of-tune. You'd think it'd be better, wouldn't you? It seems under-rehearsed and poorly recorded. So don't buy this disk for that. On the other hand, La Valse is as frightening as it should be, Daphnis et Chloe is thrilling, and Alboradora is workmanlike."
5,Elasto-Gel Hot/Cold Knee Wrap,"Great product, very comfortable and wraps completely around the knee. Have only used it cold so far. Stays cold for about 20 minutes, just right."
1,Does not stay cold long enough,"Let me start off by saying I've been icing my knees, feet, and back regularly every week for four years after my workouts. I had four different gel ice packs before buying this Elasto gel ice pack. I bought this Elasto ice pack because I wanted an ice pack that could completely wrap around my knee. For people who want to keep inflammation down after a workout, you should ice the problem area for 15 to 20 minutes every few hours. This Elasto gel ice pack stays cold for about 5 to 7 mins... I'm hugely disappointed... My four other ice packs are all extra large ice packs, and I got them for about $20/ea from CVS and Walmart, they stay very cold for more than 30 mins.What's the point of getting an ice pack that only stays cold for 5 mins? I would not recommend this ice pack to anyone at all. This was a complete waste of money for me...p.s: I also bought Elasto's Foot/Ankle ice pack wrap when I bought this knee ice pack... and yeah, wasted another $30 on that junk..."
3,Gel is good temperature..quality is OK,"I like using the gel. It is a good temperature...not too cold to be uncomfortable.I have one major and one minor issue. As a couple of other reviewers mentioned, the velcro straps can EASILY snag and tear the outside material. It just tear it so much that it leaks though. So you have to be very careful when you are putting on the wrap to only touch the velcro area of the wrap.The second thing is size. I was trying to decide which size to get (x-large vs medium) I went with the x-large. I find it a little too big. It's not a huge inconvenience because I don't move around when I have it on. I didn't ding the product for my sizing issue just mentioning it if someone is also between sizes.When I need a wrap for my shoulder, I didn't go with this brand because of the snagging issue."
3,good but......,"Everything is great about this product, but it just doesn't stay cold for very long. Wraps around your knee and stays, but certainly loses it's 'coldness' too soon."
2,medium quality,The inside cushion keeps shifting and this complicates putting the wrap over my knee. Other than that the cold works and keeps the pain down for 15-20 minutes. Cost-reward ratio is expensive.
3,wish it stayed colder longer,"This is a great item for placement and comfort around the knee, stays where you put it with the velcro. Draw back is it doesn't get freezing cold and doesn't stay cold long enough."
3,straps could be differnet,"I like the cooling effects but the straps could be sturdier. Even when sitting in a chair, the ice pack would slide off knees"
3,length of time it stays warm,"I do like, but it doesn't seem to stay as warm as I had thought. It has to be folded over in the microwave in order for it to turn around, so this might affect the proper heating."
2,Doesn't Stay Cold Long Enough,"This knee wrap doesn't stay cold long enough (in ambient temperatures of about 74 degrees Fahrenheit) to actually chill anything but the most exterior part of the knee. If you use this forget about the cold penetrating to the meniscus. I haven't used it for heating purposes, so I cannot comment on that."
4,Elasto gel Knee Wrap,"The Knee Wrap is very useful. I ordered the extra large size so my husband could also use it. I usually use it as a cold pack, the silky finish of the fabric transmits cold very fast. The only thing to be careful about is the velcro likes to catch on the fabric and snag it. You can avoid this by rolling the velcro back around itself so the scratchy hook part is stuck to the fuzzy part of the elastic straps. The snags don't seem to affect performance but I wish there were instructions on this in the packaging. Otherwise, it is a great product."
3,good wrap!,This wrap holds the cold very well. Only criticism I have is that the velcro straps stick to every part of the wrap and make it difficult to deal with.
4,Hot for Cold Elasto-Gel Wrap,"I had arthroscopic knee surgery and needed something to cool down the knee after physical therapy. The therapist referred me to the brand name of the product he was using. I found it on Amazon and ordered it. It came promptly and was easy to use and to wear. The pros are: easy to use, cools rather quickly, stays cold for the needed time. The cons are: a bit pricey, and would have liked it to adapt to other areas of the body better. But I am glad I have it in our family for me and others as well."
2,Cannot Recommend This Product,"The gel pac is fine but the cover is cheap and flimsy nylon that pills and tears when it makes contact with the compression straps. Retains heat or cold well, but is overpriced. I recommend the Caldera products as an alternative."
1,review for elasto gel wrap,"After reading the instruction booklet that accompanied the knee wrap, I was so disappointed. I expected the gel wrap to stay cold for 3 hours...... I didn't even get 1 hour.I'm back to using a bag of frozen peas and that stays cold for a long time.I no longer have the box or insert that came with the wrap --- you would have heard from me if I did."
2,Gets old after awhile,"Saw the first season video tape of this BBC comedy at a friend's and laughed and laughed. So I decided to purchase the entire DVD set. What a disappointment. The second and subsequent seasons showed that the writers had given it their best and all in the first season. The funniest segment in each episode really was the delivery of a joke at the end of the episode by the vicar to her airhead/incest-bred assistant to see how she would react to the joke. But the jokes got even worse than the writing of the episodes, and that's when I decided to shelf the set until I get really bored enough to watch the rest."
3,"Enjoyable, but not Hilarious","I found this seies entertaining and in some places quite funny, but for hilarity it doesn't begin to compare with the British series, ""Keeping Up Appearances"" or ""Are You Being Served"". Dibley is not a series I want to watch again and again as I do the latter two."
1,Ruined by canned laughter and childish jokes,"Really loud fake laughter, terrible dialog, I lost interest in the first episode. After several more episodes, I thought boy, this is really not for me. Very weak TV, nothing like Fawlty Towers or Ballykissangel in terms of quality. How many boob and pooh jokes can you take?"
1,Couldn't even finish the first show.,"I got a DVD from the library hoping for something along the lines of ""Keeping up Appearances."" Unfortunately for me, the first episode was filled with lewd jokes. Lesbianism, sex with animals, and a long conversation about why there should be gay vicars. The actors were okay, but I'm not willing to sit through all the crud for a couple of laughs. I'm really turned off by entertainment using their medium as a soapbox for preaching homosexuality. It's soooo boring to keep seeing the same type of thing over and over again on television!"
5,love the vicar!,This British comedy series is the best! Even our pastor found it to be delightful---many of the characters are members of every congregation.
5,A favorite,"I probably should buy a replacement copy of this now. My husband and I have watched it repeatedly. What characters! If you enjoy British humor, this series is a must!"
5,FINALLY!,What a treat to watch the entire series! I highly recommend this one if you've only seen a few midseason episodes.
5,I Love Geraldine!,"Every show is a winner, and it is great fun to begin at the beginning to watch this hilarious comedy play out. There are funny times and sweet times and sad times, but it is always great fun at Dibley."
5,The Vicar of Dibley- The Immaculate Collection,I love this show. I have a co-worker from Great Britian. She thought I might like to see the Vicar of Dibley. And she was right. After I watched her first season DVD I had to buy the whole collection.
5,My Only Complaint About the Vicar Is.....,"WHY NO BLU-RAY??? This brilliantly funny and charming sitcom from the BBC is a delight from top to bottom....and as we all know, Dawn French has quite the substantial AND charming bottom. Great writing--often wickedly funny--and a cast of local characters we never tire of, make one seriously consider moving to a bucolic village in the English countryside, and make the series absolutely wonderful!"
5,BRITISH COMEDY,"Very happy to own this collection. If you love British comedy, this one is a keeper. Dawn French is one of my favorites."
5,Fun to watch....,This set is wonderful.....the acting is great and the writing is top notch. It is refreshing to see a seies that truly differs from what is on the tube today...although it is dated...it stands up well.
5,Great series; poor marketing,"I agree with S. Forrest. This is an absolutely fabulous series. I wish it were still on television. However, the marketing is flawed. If you already have a few of the show's DVDs you cannot know for certain if these are repeats or new DVDs."
4,Great series of TV viewing,"I wanted this collection of TV programs to give as a present because I knew she would enjoy it. The box of DVDs was shipped in a timely fashion in plenty of time to review and wrap before Christmas.It was shipped in a timely fashion, and has been greatly enjoyed. The episodes are extremely funny."
5,HI-larry-OUS!,"Go! Go now and buy all that is Dibbly, all that is related to the outstanding Miss. Geraldine Granger.This is a very fun program, and makes me laugh every time I watch them. They just never seem to get old. Dawn French is amazing in her role as the Vicar or the Dibbly parish in rural England.I highly recommend."
5,Sam's review,"I love the Vicar of Dibley, it is an incredible collection. This came at a time when The Church of England had just started ordaining women priests. Many people especially male vicars were upset and very angry. This collection is funny and offensive, it shows the human side of a female vicar and all the crazy people she puts up with. We have all known someone on a committee who is a bossy boots pain in the buns, another who can not make up which side of the fence their on, and the one who is so boring you actually avoid them. This cast of characters is absolutely incredible, and so well done, I have watched my collection twice. Warning if you are a religious conservative please avoid it will really offend you."
5,toooooo funny !!!,One of the best of the English comedies. I watched with my niece and we laughed til we cried. The Engagement and Easter Bunny episodes are the best. Be ready to laugh out loud!
4,Improved artwork for this Baron Fel story,"This is Vol 6 of the X-Wing saga, and the 2nd of 2 TPB's about Baron fel. Stackpole does the entire story here and we get a new art team of crespo Hall and Johnson with 4 ink and color people.The pencil work has very few lazy artist panels and only a 2 sections where the ink and coloring fell off so I give the art team a 3.8. Who ever did the pencils in last 25% of the book was a 4plus.This is a comic, I usually emphasis the visual elements in my grading. But this is the second half of the story of Baron Soontir Fel, the greatest fighter ace of the empire, and for a short time a Rogue, and the guy the Wedges sister marries. This comic is about the story and you will like the story. It is a strong plus that the artwork here is about average."
2,Paper jams constantly,"I've owned 4-5 HP printers over the years, and this is the only one I've found to to completely unsatisfactory. The paper jams constantly, and when it does, you can't delete the print job -- I usually have to reboot the printer AND the computer to clear out the printer queue. When it does print, the machine is s-l-o-w. However it does one thing very fast: eat through print cartridges. So...it's cheap to buy but very expensive to run. On the positive side, I can say that the print quality is fine. I guess this printer could be OK if you have very low volume requirements. To be fair, I have overtaxed what it was designed to deliver. But there's no excuse for constant jamming. Bottom line: this machine wastes hours of my time each month. Or did. I've just ordered a n Officejet 6310 to replace it."
3,"as conan says ""good for the money""","The product is easy to use but if you are using it on a desktop it takes up a lot of room,not in its foot print but in the space it takes when the leaves are open for the feeder and the printed pages. Printing speed is slow and the ink carts are used up quickly. If you are not a frequent faxer it's fine and you dont need many copies as well. This machine is meant for light use not an office machine."
3,"Inexpensive, but functional","I bought this to replace the ""free"" Epson all-in-one that I got when I purchased my MacMini. The Epson was a disaster; it worked (barely) at first, then needed all color cartridges to be replaced ($$$)and then refused to work after 2 sheets had passed through with marginal readability. Thus far, this machine has done all that I've needed, though I don't make extensive copies on my home computer. I don't FAX, so I've no experience with that element.As a side issue, the Air America advertising blackout by Hewlett Packard has made me extremely unlikely to ever purchase their products again. There are other choices and this kind of reactionary stand by a producer/retailer is sufficient to make me look elsewhere."
4,"Small, dependable. easy to use.","I previously owned an earlier model of this printer/scanner/fax and it lasted more than 3 years before it went bad, which, I am told, is a good run for such an inexpensive item. I prefer this to a flatbed scanner type. For a small home office it is perfect and easy to use. It has settings for better printing, like photo work, which looks ok. I was unable to find this printer/fax at any local stores. My last one was from Coscto, for $130. So, I was amazed at the omline price of 89.99 with no tax and no shipping, delivered to my door. Yea!Amazon"
3,Not bad for the price but won't scan,"I can get it to print, I can get it to copy. I can NOT get it to scan.At least the ink cartriges are cheaper than the Lexmark I used to have."
1,The Mystery Fax Machine,I bought this product for only the fax function. It was cheaper then other just fax machines. The Mystery was how many pages of a fax I sent would actually arrive. If I sent a 5 page fax 3-4 pages may actually arrive. Sometimes all of the pages might arrive and the machine would print out an error notices. I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they sent a replacement machine in under 24 hours. (Have to love that about Amazon) That machine had the same problem and was also sent back. I went to Office Depot and bought a Brother Super G3. It works great and my faxes are no longer a mystery.So much for cheap fax machines
4,Good printer !!,"Nice working all-in-one printer - copies good, faxes good and good quality printing - haven't tried the scanner out yet but I'm sure it works just as well as the others. Good value for the price !"
3,Good printing,"This is a good machine, but why couldn't they include a USB cable, which is required to hook it up to a computer, which is required to use most of the software applications? For this reason, I say three stars on this one."
2,"Ok Printer, Little Slow and Can not use for booklet copy/scan","This is a functional printer for low usage. A normal 20 page presentation takes about 20+ minutes to print. While it is good in whatever it does, and supposed to, do not buy if you want to copy pages from books/passports etc as it is not a fat blad copier/scanner."
4,nice home copier/fax/printer,"I got this model a few months ago, for a newly opened home office, and it has been very reliable and of good quality. i like the user-friendly manual and very easy to follow video graphics, e.g., how to get rid of paper jam (which doesn't happen very often). got it with HP black ink cartridge, which is also good quality, and the cartridge is very easy to install. It does go through the cartridges quickly, so 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, a great all in one copier/fax/printer."
3,A step down,"This printer is definitely a step down from my previous printer, an HP T series 3 in 1. The paper feed is an issue, and even when there is paper in the tray, I get an error message that the paper tray is empty. It will not take any specialty papers, such as:labels, postcards, or thicker card stock. It would not even take regular weight colored paper. This purchase was a mistake!"
3,Compact printer,"Takes up little space. Produces clear concise copies. Makes a lot of noise. Cartridges sometimes get stuck after printing and have to open printer or turn off computer to get them to work again. Cannot copy books because it does not have a flatbed. Good for light use, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Didn't Last Long,"I liked this printer - while it worked. Its lightweight and easy to use. The one complaint I had with it was that the ink gauge was always off significantly. It would suggest I replace the print cartridge several weeks before it actually ran out of ink.My main complaint with the printer was that shortly after the warranty ran out the scanner malfunctioned. This prevented using it for scans, copies, and outbound faxes - the only thing I could do was to receive faxes and print. I only use the printer a couple of times per month, so was very disappointed with the short shelf life."
3,good simple fax machine,"the fax machine is a replacement for an earlier HP model which no longer was able to print-and no longer able to receiove faxes since the roller from the printout paper didnt work. The new model seems to work okay but it lacks a phone, you need to use a separate phone if you want to call before faxing. Also some of the construction seems a little shoddy-particulary the cheap plastic printout tray. Overall the machine was very easy to setup and use. Ut was a very good buy-an inexpensive decent fax machine-I dont use it as a scanner and copier since I have other scanners and copiers but I needed a simple inhome fax."
3,Perplexing...,"First let me state that my 3 star rating is not based on the machine -- it seems to be an excellent value and time will tell if it holds up -- but on the frustration encountered in receiving the machine. As you will notice, you have to order the cable separately -- and it ships separately. I received the printer but no cable UNTIL DAYS LATER -- so there it sat, of less use than a doorstop. Why on earth HP and Amazon -- two heavyweights of the manufacturing and retail world -- can't provide a complete setup is beyond me. I'm sure the cable (standard USB to connect to computer) is right for 98% of customers, so why not include it? Add the 5 bucks to the cost of the machine, but don't leave us holding a piece of equipment that's useless without a simple cable."
1,paper refused to feed ever.,Bought this brand new. Only one of the two paper rollers worked so the paper would never feed. Called customer service ahd they said they could not helop me other than to encourage me to return the unit. Must be a manufacturing problem. Very dissappointed that HP would not have tested this in the factory. I am very ticked! Will not buy HP again.
4,HPOfficejet 4315,A very good printer and copier for those people who do not require a flat bed platen for copying. The copy speed is slightly under the speed represented in the literature.
3,The printer won't print....,"I'm having to edit my review. After having this printer for one week, the flashing light that says cartridge error will not shut off. Originally that was just annoying but now the printer will not print. We've tried alternate cartridges, and followed the limited instructions to correct the problem. With no success, I'm returning this printer to amazon for a partial refund. I'm not able to update the number of stars I'd originally given this printer, but I would adjust my rating down to zero stars. Still looking for a reasonable home printer...."
1,worst printer ever made!,"My poor grandfather owns this printer. Every other week he needs my help with this horrible printer. The cartridges slide back and forth noisily with any requested task -it takes forever to print, it jams every time. The yellow light flashes signaling a paper jam of which there never is, this is just a piece of crap . I helped him to order another thinking we maybe just had a lemon...the second one was just as bad if not worst. Don't waste your frustrations on this one. I would recommend a HP laser jet printer and separate scanner and fax. This is by far the worst all-in-one I have ever used!"
4,all in one printer,i love my all in one printer & it takes up such a little space. and it does almost everything. i did have a problem scanning & then emailing but I really didn't spend much time on it.
3,Not worth full price but does the job,"Not worth the full price advertised but does the job for quick printouts. Also I did not pay this price originally. Ink price is reasonable $13.00 to 19.00 per cartridge and depending on where you shop. Good for quick printouts, goes through lots of ink though, screen very difficult to read, would be nice if it was backlit for easier reading. At least I don't feel like I'm paying more for the ink than the printer."
1,Avoid this peice of garbage,"I have had this all in one for a couple of years and it rarely works as it should. The last straw is that it will no longer recognize the scan function as of this day. All attempts to correct the software through HP channels result in the message ""there is no known solution to the issue"" Look elsewhere and avoid HP at all costs."
3,"Decent hardware, poor Mac support","I have now had this printer for a few months and can say the print quality is good.Scanning works well. The buttons on the front provide quick access to scanning.I cannot comment on fax performance and I imagine copying performance is similar to scanning, which works well.I have a Mac with Mac OS X Leopard and I find the included HP software is over-complicated and confusing at times (I am a software developer, not a computer neophyte). I can always get it to do what I want it to do but it is awkward and irritating at times.Another minor issue I have is with the timing of the ""low ink"" warnings. They're too early. It seems you can still print quite a bit (perhaps 20-30 pages) when the ink is ""low""."
1,Fix far more than print...,"The HP 4315 All-in-One printer is aptly named if by All-in-One they mean frustration, anger, and wasted time ALL rolled into one. It frequently locked up in a print queue when I ran it on my old XP system. Now that I'm running it (or attempting to) on my Vista system, it does the same thing. Only difference is under XP I could occasionally get it to work. Under Vista, I've uninstalled and re-installed the driver and the diagnostics. Nothing has ever printed. DON'T try to use this printer (or any HP printer?) on Vista. Also, it's in a circular hell of sorts. The hung file can't be printed but it also can't be deleted. HP help (across the pond) was of no help. I'll try Kodak -- save some money, some ink, and a whole lot of frustration."
3,"Worked Good, While it Worked","I used this primarily for printing, and sometimes as a scanner and it worked fine. However, after less than a year it just stopped feeding the paper. Can't get the rollers to roll the paper through (tried everything, different size papers, etc). It's not worth the cost to get it fixed, so will probably get a different brand."
2,"Small Printer, Small Cartridges, Small Price, Big Headache!","OK OK - I know I got it cheap but I expected more than this as I ALWAYS buy HP Printers and have always loved them. I bought this printer because it could do everything and was small - I could take it on business trips! That part is good. I am now done traveling and it is in my home office. Not up to HP usual standards - the cartridges run out after 10 - 15 pieces of paper printing and I am not kidding. It is costing me a fortune in ink. If you should mistakenly jam a piece of paper in there and you have to turn off the printer to clear it - then turn it back on, you then have to reboot your computer to get it to connect to the computer again. It's frustrating and I wish I had spent a bit more to get a printer that can keep up with my business. I guess it is good for someone who does a lot of scanning, but not a lot of printing."
2,No Good For The Long Haul,"At first, things were great. After awhile, the rollers loosen and you really have to baby-sit the machine to do much of anything. I would say this machine is okay for extremely light use, but if you do alot of scanning and/or faxing, this thing is likely to give out on you after about a year."
4,Officejet 4315,I was looking for a fax/printer that didn't take up too much space and didn't cost a lot. I am really satisfied with this product especially considering the price. It prints quickly and the print is clear and crisp. The cartridges are easier to replace than my Lexmark. I've had no problems with the fax function. As a matter of fact it faxed very quickly. I like that the trays fold up making it less obtrusive. I didn't expect a big professional office fax/printer but the 4315 performed better than I expected. You sacrifice some ink tank size for a small printer size but it's worth the trade off. It's not the quietest printer I've used but still not bad. I've sent some pretty big files to it with no problems. I like that it warms up quickly and you can print within seconds of turning it on. Overall it's an excellent printer for the price.
4,Great price for a fax machine and copier. Not a bad printer.,I wanted a fax machine and copier that were independent of the computer and didn't want to spend a lot of money since they won't be used on a regular basis. This was the perfect answer. I am very happy with all of the functions of this machine.
4,satisfied customer,"this is the neatest , cutest and best all in one i have ever owned . HP rocks maan"
2,Ribboncraft?????,"This is simply a quick & easy craft book with the usual craft items...paper, glue, boxes, etc embellished with a piece of ribbon. The photography is great & instructions are clear but hardly qualifies as ""ribboncraft"" when you're only using a few inches of ribbon."
1,is it really gold?,I bought this for my girl friend and she has worn it20 days now.....and the cheap thing snaped like cheap metal. It got snaged on the carpet and broke.....not bent but broke.... is it really gold? there is no stamp stating 14kt..........I want a refund or another one.......
3,47th St photo Powershot kit,very pleased with service and equipment. compact kit provides tele & wide angle capablities + filters.Camera & everything fit into small carrying case- & kit included a versatile tripod
2,Nice looking on the outside...,"When I first received the locket in the mail (gift for my girlfriend) I thought it looked beautiful. However, upon opening it, it seems that there isn't much possibility for insertion of a picture. Most lockets have an insert in which one could trace the outline upon a picture to cut it out and fit right inside the locket. This one offers no aid in fitting a picture inside and the bracket on the locket is quite loose. I don't recommend buying it if you plan to put a picture inside."
4,Good gift,I bought this for my mother in law for Christmas. She loved it. No complaints. Although I did buy a longer chain for the necklace.
2,Not a great product overall.,"I'd say its a glorified sticker and not worth the money put into it. I give it a 2 because they didn't lie about the product, they just didn't tell you the whole truth. If you ever take it off, it refuses to stick on the ds, so it is not a re usable skin. And it is fairly cheesy."
5,Slap--Slap---Slap--Your Mistress is angry.,"One of the best games on the market, in my opinion. Just love being the bad guy, instead of the regular good versus evil scenerio.The game actually teaches you how to play, which is rare any more in the gaming industry. Build and manage you money. Some levels are easier than others, but then there is one that you have a killer time beating, as you get attacked wave after wave and unless you build a prison, immediately, no way to get gold easily. The addon, is okay, but I think it could of been better.The second DK 2, wasn't as good as the first one, here. Too much shading and the graphics are not the best for such an expensive game.DK 1, love it and wished there had been an offical level maker/editor. I wished EA would make another game similiar or identical to DK1. I would buy it in an instant!!"
3,wrong,"""As a woman, you are at risk for developing osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and related diseases as you grow older.""not exactly correct.actually men are also at extreme risk. any bone book written for women only loses credibility. men accountfor 25% of osteoporosis. and that's about 2 million of us... strange that a ""bone expert"" would not know this."
2,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed in this purchase. I gave it a good chance and hoped it would get better but with each chapter, the information became less and less worthwhile. I definitely would recommend Preventing and Reverrsing Osteoporosis by Alan Gaby instead."
4,"Well designed example of the ""enigma"" adventure","At last, the huge module (96 pages!) that covers the adventure of Alias in the Forgotten Realms - the heroes (levels 6-9) awaken to find curious blue sigils wrapped around their skin - what could this mean? Worse, their ""mark of Cain"" makes them VERY intriguing to some horrific evil that they'd rather not contend with... this adventure will teach your players paranoia in a way that only life-threatening fun ever could. :)"
3,It's okay but there are better books out there,"This book was great when it initially came out. However, nowadays, you need some new stuff in order to make it in. Considering the fact that a zillion people bought this book and wrote based on it, admissions are on to it. I suggest From High School to Med school by Raju and Yanofski for some fresh essays. It's written for accelerated medical programs, but they have some good essays in there."
3,Interesting essays with some useful pointers,"I found this book not as useful as it claims to be. The essays feature here are usually too unique to be used as ""model essays"". Most of these candiates are best of the best students with tons of great experiences or personal accounts. I still enjoy reading through many of these essays and the pointers the book provides. However DO NOT expect to use these essays as model for your personal statements. This is not what this book is for."
3,"Doesn't have the best essays I've read, but does help.","This book is half information and half essays. The majority of the essay writers seem guaranteed a pick of any school due to their background. Many accomplished extraordinary work in addition to having doctors in their family. The first half was great, but, though I am not a very good writer, I could tell that some of the essays needed improvement. I think this book's projected audience is Ivy League students."
3,Useful but not completely,"This book has a lot of good advice but all the sample essays are from people who got accepted to Harvard Medical School. I know most of us haven't volunteered in a 3rd world country or published research papers or saved someone's life, so it would have been nice to read some essays from a non-superhero applicant. Also a little variety as to what schools they were accepted to would have been nice. They were all Harvard and other Ivy League schools. It also sounds like the authors consider those to be the ""top schools"" but they may or may not be depending on whether you're talking about research or primary care. Bottom line: needs more variety of example essays. But overall it was a pretty useful guide."
4,Essays That Will Get You into Medical School,this is a good book that was helpful in giving me an idea of the type of information that should and should not go into writing a personal statement.
2,Disappointed in the questions,I found myself skipping over many questions that i didn't feel were very..interesting. I first got interested in the book when i saw a poll online for you to vote for the top question of 2008. Many of the questions were very interesting. But the ones in the book..not so much.
3,arrived damaged,Purchased this for a gift and I was disappointed that it was chipped in the corner. My son (the recipient) said it wasn't worth returning it (very heavy so it would have been expensive to ship). Other wise a very nice product and arrived quickly.
1,String Broke.,"This was a gift. When my parents received it, it was broken. The string that slices the cheese was snapped. Super bummer."
2,Logrey,"I would not buy a marble cheese slicer again, at least not this brand. The hole that holds the handle is too large so the wire does not stay in the channel. I have to keep moving the arm after each slice. A real pain."
2,Cheese Slicer Unhappy,"The marble slicer is pretty to look at and has a good weight to keep from moving around counter when cutting cheese, but it doesn't do a very good job on cheddar sharp cheese."
2,Cheap construction. Wouldn't buy again.,"I got this slicer as a Christmas gift for my brother and his wife. It came in the mail just a few days before Christmas. If I'd had time to send it back, I would have. Other than the nice hefty block of marble, it feels like something I bought at the dollar store. The arm, plastic handle, and wire all seem prone to breakage and just feel cheap. There is a note on the bottom telling you how to align the wire with the slot...it says to simply slide the arm in or out of the block as needed. There's no adjustment screw, or notched settings or anything...nothing to keep the arm in the right place once you have the wire aligned.Cheap cheap cheap."
2,Looks great!,"This is a beautiful cheese slicer. However it does have some draw backs. Cheese sticks to the marble top, so sliding it around is not possible. With that its hard to get consistent pieces of cheese. The wire cuts through easily, but mine seems to drift a little and does not want to end up in the groove. Maybe my handle is bent. Also that grove is a pain to clean! You need a brush to get in there. One month after Ive owned it, one of the legs broke off. Its a simple fix.... Looks like the manufacture used super glue to put them on. Figured they would have used something stronger. Honestly I wouldn't buy this again!"
4,Corningware,"The CorningWare 23-Ounce French White Oval Dish is the perfect size for two people, for so many things -- marinating a small piece of meat or fish, a serving dish for vegetables, baking a small casserole, defrosting small items in the microwave. I can't imagine why Corningware stopped producing them."
3,The lid is not as pictured,"I ordered this item after trying another size that I really liked, but when I received this one the lid did not have the blue ""vent"" in it as shown in the picture. It came with just a plain white lid."
5,nontoxic frozen dinner cooking,"I had searched forever for a nontoxic alternative to heating up frozen dinners in their own plastic trays. Until I found this CorningWare 23"" oval dish, none were satisfactory--too big, too narrow, too deep, too wide ... This one is perfect. I often take frozen LeanCuisine or similar frozen entrees to work. They're great and a relatively healthy choice for busy folks like me--as long as I don't have to risk the outgassing of toxic chemicals from the trays and cover when heating the food ... This CorningWare 23"" oval dish is perfectly sized to pop your typical frozen entree into before heating in the microwave. It's also a perfect single serving au gratin dish ... great for eggs florentine or eggplant parmigiana. It's also sturdy, easy to clean, has good eye appeal. A real winner."
5,O.J. IS GUILTY BUT NOT OF MURDER,This book is excellent! I truly believe Mr. Dear has solved this crime. I hope his book will reopen the case and the guilty will get the help he needs before he hurts someone else.
5,AWESOME,"What a book! Bill's discription of his 6-year investigation was so vivid I felt as though I was there with him. He has definitely confirmed in my mind what I have thought since almost the beginning, and I wish him the best with the final outcome. In my opinion, this is his best book yet. Thank you, Bill, for devoting your time, money, your health and that wonderful investigative mind so that others may have a better idea of such a terrible event."
1,OJ's Son Jason...,"...is who William Dear pins the murder on, and it is even more ridiculous than all of the other non-OJ murderer theories out there. I think the same people who are SO SURE OJ didn't do it would be just as outraged at this alternative theory. It's a shame, because I enjoyed Mr. Dear's previous books and marveled at his detective work (albeit Mr. Dear's ego is a bit overwhelming at times, and possibly clouds his judgment in this case). This is an expensive book, so I felt it my duty to at least let a potential buyer know where the direction of the investigation heads and therefore you can just for yourself whether or not you want to spend your hard-earned money and time on this interesting, but thoroughly implausible theory. I just wonder what dirt Mr. Dear has on Charlie Sheen to get his glowing review. No offense to Mr. Dear, I highly recommend either of his previous books should you be able to get them."
1,Absurd.,"In my opinion the theories in this book are totally unbelievable. Dear fails to explain many, many instances of evidence against Simpson as well as his behaviors. It certainly did not make a believer of me. Even after studying this book I think OJ did indeed get away with murder."
1,Give us a break...,This is a silly silly story. The proof was there..Many mistakes by the D.A.s office..They just didn't know how sneaky the Defence was.O.J did it and he had plenty of time.Did you ever see the movie Pulp Fiction..They blow this guy up in a car-blood all over.Take it to a place.Stand in plastic sacks and undress.He wouldn't have much blood on himself from Nicole.He knocked her down then grabed her hair from the back leaving a shoe print on her back while he sliced her thoat.Ron didn't have a chance being off gaurd...I think this book is hog wash but I am sure some will enjoy it to see all the made up stories that can come out of the truth.
4,Great Watch,"Great watch overall:Pros:Lightweight - highly recommend titanium vs. stainless steelStylishNever needs batteriesAbility to show two time zonesAlarm (loud enough, but not obnoxious)Cons:Slow to switch display between time zonesSquare face can make some areas difficult to readNeed to find a jeweler to adjust braceletCan accidentally turn the crown which can unexpectedly change the display modeAlarm only works with home time zone"
3,My experience is negative.,"My experience is negative.When I've got the watch, it had a little defect: the second hand does not point exactly to the time marks, it points about 1/3 of mark clockwise.[...]In general it is a nice watch."
3,Hope you packed a lunch!,"This is a beautiful watch, but it takes forever to set the alarm. When you go to ""alarm"" mode to set the alarm time, the hour and second hands travel slowly around the watch face to meet the current alarm time. Very tedious!!!"
3,Too slow and too little,"The book is great if you just need to know MFC in few days. The plus point is use of good examples. But what is lacking is ""why you have to do that"" explainations. Also, something which is very irritating is the almost constant reference to the companion book (how to program in c++). It is almost as if telling if you dont have that book then you cant expect to accomplish much."
3,Very Elementary,"Fair book, but if you have any knowledge of MFC, go for something else. It doesn't cover any of the more complex classes."
5,JAE,"A good introduction to using MFC. Makes no use of confusing wizards so it's easy to see what's going on in resource files. Well worth the few hours of time it takes to go through all the examples, code for which is available free online."
3,exactly what it says,"I am a unix/C ""old school"" programmer switching to windows programming. This book is exactly what the title says. It is an INTRODUCTION to MFC. Very basic. If you just want to get a few dialogs running then this book will help you do that within minutes. But it does NOT use any wizards(why else would you want to know MFC?) and it only goes into the most basic C++. This would be a good book for maybe a middle-school to high school class. So basically, I give this book 3 stars because it is what it says and will help you in ""getting started"" but that is absolutely it. If you want real understanding, if you are trying to figure out what the wizards can do for you or if you need to do more advanced applications, then you will need another resource."
2,"Interesting, good examples, but not all that useful","Positives: First I thought the book was very good in that it was very explicit in its examples. Most books have enough ambiguity so that running the examples is cumbersome. Not so in this book where instructions are explicit, examples have no typos and screenshots are useful. I also found the content interesting - it shows you the inner workings of MFC. Finally, I applaud the authors for trying to write a smaller book (only 140 pages compared to 1000 pages for most programming books).Negatives: The book does not use the Visual C++ wizards. The author states this up front. But who would actually use Visual C++ without the wizard tools? I think after showing the information about MFC the author could have then shown how to do the same things with the wizards."
4,The other side of James Brown,"Excellent mellow album, quite unlike anything else from JB, the mellow side of JB.First heard the track on Jazzfm!! they are excellent for finding unusual tracks and albums like this.Mike Michael"
5,ProTech 8505 Commercial Carbon Monoxide Monitor,ProTech 8505 Commercial Carbon Monoxide MonitorExcellent CO monitor have 2 of these in commercial setting they do work well and with a little math you can calculate the event time very easily.
2,Marketing information,Not a very interesting book. Reading it is like reading pure marketing material from Nokia.
5,Quick Solutions With Dreamweaver,"As someone who has been handed an existing Dreamweaver website to administer, I found this book to be extremely useful. Knowing nothing about the software, I was able to reference the book to quickly fix problems and carry out updates. To really use Dreamweaver a proper tutorial would be required, which this is not. It's targeted at those who need to work with Dreamweaver without a great deal of background knowledge and succeeds 100%."
2,Doesn't Fly,"I bought 2 of these, and the rip cord keeps getting caught and can't be pulled-then after a lot of finagling it pulls again-I can't even get it to work, much less my 6 year old."
5,Fun toy!,"I bought this for my 11 yr old and I bought a different one for my 6 yr old. They've had hours of fun playing with these. It's probably a litle young for the 11 yr old, but she has fun anyway."
3,Kinda gets the job done,"Really, if you need one of these, your saddle needs to be reflocked or it just doesn't fit.But if you are like me and pick one up to hold off buying a new saddle, you might consider spending a few extra bucks and just picking up the full length one. The first time I used this, it repeatedly slid out from under my saddle. I spent the whole ride standing up and shoving it back up under the saddle. Seriously annoying.I solved the problem by stuffing it in a pillowcase and then placing it under the saddle, with the rest of the pillowcase laying normally up under the saddle like a pad. It stays under the saddle now, but I'd still say that the full length riser would probably be a better investment.Oh well."
4,Good for women in their 50's,"I have been taking 3 cups a day for almost 3 months to help with energy balance and hot flashes. It is good for women after Fifty who has problems with all of the above. There is one problem though, I started to have muscles pain in my arms and neck which make me stop taking it. I think this formula contains too many conflicting ingredients."
4,Detailed account of the formation and breakup of Yugoslavia,Christopher Bennett gives a very accurate history of Yugoslavia from before WWI up to 1994. Very detailed beginning with 1980 forward. Very informative. Worked well for a research paper I prepared using it.
5,Gambit is the Best,"Although ""stereotyped"" Super heros are no longer cool. Remember Superfriends in the 70's or 80's. Anyone that appreciates Nawlins and the Cajun archtypes,has to love the Gambit. Anyway as far as the book itself it was an X Mas gift, for my kids. After reading it, they agreed that ""Gambit is the best"" They also thought Gambit should of been in the Movie, not ""Cry Baby Cylops"""
3,Landscape in the Mist--The DVD version.,"I have been waiting for years for this extraordinary, beautiful film to come out on DVD. The film itself easily rates five stars, or more. But, sadly, not this DVD. The old New Yorker video was woefully inadequate. Unfortunately, New Yorker seems to have done nothing more than transfer the video onto DVD. The ratios are clearly off and the picture quality is very poor. Even the subtitles are ugly. There are no extras worth mentioning (scene selection, if you want to count that.) This is a travesty against one of the greatest cinematic artists of our time. Criterion, are you listening???Since there are no other available forms, by all means watch the DVD or the video. Just be aware that you are not seeing the work as it was intended by the artist, Theo Angelopoulos--alas, better a poor copy than nothing at all. But hopefully, when Artificial Eye in the UK finally gets around to bringing out their version, they will do more justice to the film."
5,The best movie i ever seen,"I saw this greek movie, and i did not even know it was so great, it was late at night and i started crying all the time, it`s a really heavy drama, there are a lot of symbolisms during the movie, long silence shots that makes you think about the chaos around us, if you like drama, you can't miss this one!"
5,A movie not to miss,"I saw this movie years ago. Whenever anyone asks what my favorite movie is, my reply is always the same. The only film in my life that really stuck, ""Landscape in the Mist"". Allot of movies Iv seen are good but I soon forget its name and the plot. This film would be defiantely worth anyone's time. Beautiful and touching and unforgettable!"
4,Great As Always,"You can never go wrong with a Bose product. A little pricy but worth the money. I have been using it for the last few months without issue, I love having music in multiple rooms throught out my house"
5,Manners and Customs of Bible Lands,this book is helpful in understanding the perceived harshness of the Old and New Testaments. easy to read. good reference book to keep near your Bible!
2,Not what I thought,"The item is very well made and is pretty but it doesn't keep my insulin cold it looses its temperature so fast!The problem is You can't freeze the ice packs because you will change the temperature of your insulin, you have to put them in the fridge but when you go out it does not last very long.The shipping and everything went so smooth. But They should say that the ice packs are not freezable for insulin users."
3,Enjoyable but less creative,"Since I have all of the Ripps CDs and 50% of the music I listen to is the Ripps, I quess I am a fan of the Ripps and I consider their CDs to be the epitome of uplifting, warm music. Let it Ripp is no exception in that regard, but I do think it is not quite as melodic as previous CDs.I have two ways of measuring my enjoyment of CDs: 1) How many times I play it before I like it and 2) How many times I play it after I have absorbed it. This CD took many plays before I began to appreciate it and I am not playing it as much as their earlier CDs.If you are a Ripps fan, you will eventually like this CD, if you are not a ""fan"" then you'll likely be disappointed. This is a matter of perspective. Compared to their earlier releases, it's not as interesting; but compared to others in their genre, it is heads and shoulders above them all."
2,"Erm, lets not let it ripp","After being a fan of the rippingtons since tourist in paradise, iv listened to all the rippingtons music since the beginning (there best efforts being between 1987-1992), since then, the complexity and general realness has slowly declined, with russ using none of the band members on some albums. On this album however, most of the tracks feature real instruments, a nice break from the electronics of 'topaz and russ freemans drive', the only snag is that the music really is the most unimaginative stuff russ has ever made. Some of the tracks sound so alike (high life + stingray) that you could be led to believe they just couldnt be bothered. The original summer sparkling sound they used to have is no more, and its quite sad really as they are a superb group of musicians, especially kim stone (damn!!). They really have hit rock bottom with this album and its very dissapointing stuff, not worth the dollars everyone."
2,Leftovers?,"This album sounds like stuff left over from their other CDs, stuff that didn't make the cut then. It doesn't now either. I'm not happy with this CD at all."
1,let it R.I.P.,"I guess RIP stands for ""rest in peace"" as the band seems to have been comatose or near death during the writing and recording of this CD....a big disappointment"
3,"Almost , but not quite. . .","A common practice with my first listen/review of a CD is to review the insert. Russ indicates that, "". . . our fan's seem to really love our high energy stuff, so we decided to go for it."" Well. . . ., almost. This CD is a far cry from Weekend in Monaco, Curves Ahead and nowhere near the brilliance of their first recording Moonlighting. There was a certain edge to the upbeat stuff on the earlier Rippingtons CDs that disappeared somewhere around/after the Black Diamond release. Let it Ripp certainly hints at some of the ""lost energy"" but never attains the heights. Now, this review is not a complete pan. The musicianship is top notch - kudos to Bill Heller for some really nice keyboard work and Eric Marienthal is solid as always and a great addition. The tunes are solid (albeit with the Russ Freemanisms mentioned by another reviewer) but the group, as a whole, never really ""lets it ripp."""
3,Motion is not always progress,"First, I am a huge fan of the Ripps...having purchased nearly the entire collection, and had the highest hopes for the new album after having my socks blown flat off by the sterling 2000 effort, ""Life in the Tropics"". That CD dazzled; this new one fizzles. Don't get me wrong...good production values, good writing, good playing, but the inspiration, drive and variety, well noted in the 2000 effort, and some stunning past releases, are just not there in this one. Perhaps it was because they avoided bringing in guests, unlike recent albums in the past, but, sadly, this is a sonically monochromatic effort, and I am used to hearing them in Technicolor!The true Ripp fan will pass on this one other than just to add to the collection, making a complete set. Sorry, guys! Give me another ""Avienda Del Mar"" or ""Til We're Together"" next time...and bring on the guests!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I am a fan of the Rippingtons since 1989. Seen numerous live concerts of them perform. Own almost all their CD's. But then, this album....with a title like LET IT RIPP.... is extremly disappointing. What happened Russ ? Barring a few songs like Private Getaway, Bella Luna & Cast a spell, the rest of the songs lack melody & direction. Russ seems to have lost a hold on this one. The instrumentation could have been much better with less/milder usage of sax & horns. Come on Russ...you are capable of something much better than this."
3,Lost its magic,"Having been an ardent fan of the Rippingtons who scoured the earth for the rare albums, I am afraid to say that today's Rippingtons has lost its magic.Much of that magic was from percussionst Steve Reid. Without him, the music has lost its sparkle, surprises and excitement. Having listened to Let It Ripp at the shops four times at a leisurely pace, I couldn't bring myself to get it. The musicianship is still there; the compositions are pleasant enough... but that raw energy, that Steve Reid mysticism, the stunning dynamics and interplay during the solos... all are absent here."
3,Dad's project,"I given this book in hopes of helping me build a play area for my son. The book was informative, but it did have limited ideas for play areas. It was a good reference tool, but again iI am looking for another book with more options and building ideas for the weekend builder."
2,Interesting but ulitimately unhelpful book,"Several people suggested I read this book because they found it the best book about being a submissive, especially a service oriented one. While reading this book was interesting, I found almost nothing in it that would help me in my relationship with my mistress.The goals and ideas Baldwin sets down are not ones that resonate with me. I read the whole book and felt frustrated that I wasn't getting what I wanted out of it. I didn't feel like I understood service submission any better than when I started the book.Personally, I would suggest the two Miss Abernathy books. Epecially the work book which is full of exercises to do. I don't agree with everything she says, but I agree with most of it and I have found it extremely helpful."
3,A little too flowery,"I read this book for many reasons, the most obvious being the top reason. I found the slave that wrote this book talked in circles, with a most flower power, over the top verbiage that had me screaming ""Get to the point"". As I understand there will be slave indentified persons that will find this to be their bible, I can not subscribe to his way of thinking. It did get repetitive and a bit confusing and congested with his many metaphors. I found that there were many of his concepts that were on the right path but ended up incomplete and left the reader exposed unfulfilled. Ultimate, this will not be on my recommendation list but I could definitely see why some slave indentified persons will subscribe to this book.A."
2,Difficult read,"I know many who swear by this book, but I found it rather difficult to read. Other books kept my interest and flow better while giving nearly the same information."
1,Boring and repetitive,"The book is a disjointed rambling which attempts to elucidate the author's philosophy on slavedom. Instead, he repeats, over and over, again and again, that being a slave is simply a state of mind. What makes it intolerable is his annoying use of amateurish mixed metaphors that don't make sense. The writing is uninspiring and boring, simplistic pedestrian grammar and prose. The only redeeming pages are those authored by Pat Califia, whose professional writing stand in stark contrast to that of the author."
2,Caviat Emtor,We bought one for my Daughter and she LOVED it! But the launcher broke the first day. So we returned it and got another. And the launcher broke again! I'd return for cash but my three year old loves the stupid DVD cartoon that comes with it. She watches it over and over and over again.
4,FUN,"I was very skeptical when I saw the commercial of these dolls flying, but to my surprise, they really do fly! We had a lot of fun with this toy."
1,Frustrating Waste of Money- All Varieties,"This toy is disappointing piece of junk. If you follow the directions exactly, you can expect it to work about 10% of the time. It is quirky and there is not really a method to when it does or doesn't work. When it does, it's moderately interesting to watch it ""fly"". Please note that another reviewer gave it 5 stars but a negative review (citing an injury!). When you consider that mistake, it's pretty clear that there are better uses of your money than the sky dancers dolls."
5,A Kids View of Skydancers,"I am nine and remember getting this toy from some birthday money. It is a great toy, and very fun to play with. The bad side. . . Well, I would not recommend this for anyone under 6. My little sister has trouble pulling the string to get the doll flying. . . Sure, she can get it spinning, but not enough to get it flying. Other than that, I've had no problems. My sister who is 16 months younger than me enjoyed playing with mine so much she got her self one. I got this Camille Skydancer doll with the dvd and I think it's great. . . But I get a bit bored of the movie. Doesn't everybody my age do? Great product!"
5,Outstanding Animation,"My whole family and myself enjoy Firebreather. We are very much hoping for a triology as well or even more so a series.Firebreather is very detailed, the storyline is great and the animation stands out to the extreme. ITS A MUST SEE...!!!"
1,Beyond disappointing,"Sony should be ashamed to have their name associated with this product. It's absolute garbage. If I could have returned it without shipping fees, I would have, but as it is, I just considered it a $28.27 (with free shipping) lesson. The sound quality was far worse than most cheap PC speakers. ""Tinny"" would be an insult to tin. You can get far better sound for less or the same money. It's too bad, because I like their size and style."
3,"Good enough, not excellent","I would have given these speakers 3 1/2 stars, but it's either-or on Amazon, so I'm rating them 3. I bought them because at the time I had a badly designed laptop with the speakers on the BOTTOM of the unit, so even at full volume I could barely hear it. These speakers did what the laptop couldn't do-- deliver the volume I needed. However, if you're looking for theatre-quality awesome sound, you won't find it with these. Even with a slight hearing impairment, I never forget that I'm listening to small travel speakers, and you probably won't either. They snap together for easy transport, but you have to wrap the wire around them since it's not retractable. For something to get you by, it's a good value, but for better quality, you'll probably need bigger speakers."
2,Short wires,"The wires are too short on these speakers so I have to dock them on one side of the screen; I was unable to place them on both sides of my screen/laptop, which seems kind of useless to me."
1,don't go near this,just remember you get what you pay for. spend a little more and get something descent!
2,Mediocre,"I just bought a pair of these very speakers from Walmart (they were on clearance for $17).I originally bought the iHome Portable Speaker for iPod/MP3 Player (look it up, they sell in on here) for my MP3 player, and the sound was so good, but they used up batteries like crazy. I stared using them speakers for my Macbook Pro (because they even sounded better than my laptop speakers), and I was going to buy an adapter, but they didn't have the 7.5 adapter I needed at Walmart. So I bought these Sony speakers instead.The sound of these speakers is not good. Yeah, they can get you by, but it's so light, and it really made my music sound really high in treble. The sound from my laptop speakers is better. I'm going to return them, and buy a universal ac adapter for my other speaker instead."
2,no bass,"as soon as i plugged my ipod in, i knew these weren't what i was looking for as far as music goes. these speakers are great for listening to say, a class lecture. for music though, you're better off getting either the imaingo (about $35), or the ilive (also about $35 for black version). if space is an issue, the imaingo is fantastic. i plugged my imaingo in immediately after the sony speakers, and the difference between the two was night and day, and the imaingo is only slightly bigger than the sony speakers. if you have an outlet available, the ilive is even better. it charges your ipod and also has an fm radio, and isn't big at all. it's much smaller than your average boombox.i give the speakers 5 stars for voice situations, but 2 for music."
4,meets my need for portability,"I work as a park naturalist and conduct breeding bird surveys. Part of the survey protocol involves playing a recording of a birds mobbing an owl. I needed something small to take out in the field with me and these speakers are perfect for hooking up to my mp3 player. They are powered with 3AAA batteries and have a volume control. The ""tinny"" sound that some other reviews describe doesn't really matter if one is playing bird calls--most of which fall into high-pitched ranges anyway. This will be my fourth year of using them in the field. They don't take up much space in my backpack, I like the volume control and the battery life has been really good. I also occasionally use them to listen to music and they are fine, though the bass range is lacking. All in all, I've been very, very happy with them."
4,speakers,Nice speakers for camping and traveling. Sound is average but the size of the speakers makes them very nice.
3,"Weak and tinny, but worth the $$","It's very handy to have battery powered speakers. These sound fairly tinny, but they're better than the laptop."
3,Great but price went up,I usually order 2 packages of these every couple of months for my Labrador who loves them. They have always been a great buy. But they price just went up $5 per package. I'll definitely order them much less often now.
2,Cheated,I have ordered these chews several times. Three out of the last 4 bags were duds. 50% of the chews in the bag were the diameter of toothpicks. I will not waste my money ordering them again. Two stars because my dog actually loves the chews that she can have. The rest are garbage.
3,Bully sticks,"Hoped they were still 12"" long. Not so, 9"" and my Golden goes through them much faster. Almost bite size for her."
2,1 lb pack of pencils...,"I usually get my dog's bully sticks from Costco, but these looked to be about the same and about $10 cheaper (at the time, Jan 2013), so I gave them a shot. To start, there wasn't a stick in the bag that was thicker than a pencil. My dog did all the normal tricks required to get one, so it obviously smelled right to her. It took my dog all of 2-3 minutes to finish each one, so she obviously enjoyed it. However the ones I get from Costco usually take her about a half hour to get through. As of Feb 2013, the price has gone up $10 and they are now more expensive than the ones I normally buy that are much thicker and come with about the same number of sticks. Guess I'm stickin' with the Costco brand ones."
2,check each bag,"out of three bags we have received, one was full of soft and or very thin stir stick size pieces. Not suitable for a big dog, maybe okay for a tea cup chihuahua"
3,"Too thin, shorter than 1 foot which is what I espected",My dog can chew these and finish them in 2 minutes. They just aren't thick enough. There are a lot of them but they are just too thin.
1,Smells bad and made my dog very sick,My older dog devours them like they are treats. My younger dog tkaes longer to eat them. She has had VIOLENT diarrhea for 3 days since eating the first one. I am throwing the rest away. I wouldn't give them to ANY animal.
3,Dog treat,Our dogs enjoyed the bull sticks. I have a jack russel terrier and a goolden doodle. It takes them 3-4 days from start to finish. A bit pricey for a treat.
3,Thinner and thinner each time....,"My puppy was recovering from a hip surgery and was restricted for his daily activity. I was very happy reading all the good reviews about the bull sticks. For the last couple months, we went through 4 bags of this 1 lb large bull sticks. Though my puppy is always in heaven when he has one to chew on. The quality of the sticks is, sadly as other reviewers mentioned, going down hill. I just received the latest bag from UPS today, and the majority of the sticks are like pencil size. No kidding, PENCIL SIZE!I'm glad that I always add items to the cart first. This way, you'll be reminded any price change. Though I'm not happy about the size of the sticks, my puppy does love them. So I'll keep my eyes open for better options. At the mean time, guess he'll just do with pencil thin bull sticks!"
4,GOOD BUY,"My dog loves these. Only thing is they do have an odor, but that doesn't stop her from enjoying them.We take her to the park and she gets one when she comes home and then to her doggie bed for the night.Only gave 4 stars because of the strong odor. ok if you can keep them out of the living area."
2,Not like the picture! Half the sticks are short!,"The picture of this product shows sticks that are large and uniform in size. In the two packages I received, about half of the sticks were 6"" or less. I bought sticks from the same manuafacturer at Costco for about the same price---and all of the sticks were large size. With half the items being short, this becomes a very pricey product."
1,"""Large"" Bull Sticks Sickened my Dog","These bull sticks carry the same name brand as the Costco standard, Cadet Bully Stick, but are not as uniform in shape or nearly as large. Instead of smelling like dead animal, these bull sticks smell like dirty underwear. The smell didn't bother my dog... at least at first. My dog threw up each time after chewing/consuming the bull sticks. Her dumb owner (me) wasn't sure what was making her sick at first, so we had three opportunities through the week to chew and clean up. The rest of the bag went to the dumpster.If your dog has a sensitive stomach or anyone in the family has a sensitive nose, avoid these rawhide chews."
2,Bull sticks now much thinner/don't last,"My dog LOVES this product and it does help keep her teeth tartar-free, BUT the stick is much thinner than in the past and my dog can now chew through one in less than 1/2 hour as compared to 2-3 days in the past. Too expensive and too dangerous as she will swallow the stick when at 4"". Company called and they had no explanation for why the sticks are thinner, so will buy the thicker braided 12"" sticks through another company on Amazon (1/2 price vs. store pricing)."
5,"Love it, my pooch is ADDICTED","My brother's Siberian Husky loves this item so much he will do ANYTHING for them...When I received them, I was dubious, I wondered how could a great dane possibly chew something so thin and enjoy it ""for hours""...It doesn't last long (I'd say 2-3 hours, if they play with it) if the pet is a big Chewer (like my brothers pooch)BUT....it is worth it..in the long run....As I said, he'll do a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g for a stick, and so far, I've trained him pretty well just by using this.I intend to stock up."
3,Very stinky but apparently taste good,"Dog loves them, they last a long time (some almost a week, which is great for a terrier) but they are so stinky I have to open the bag outdoors while holding my breath - I store them double wrapped!"
1,Skinny Bully Sticks,I was very disappointed with these bully sticks. They were incredibly skinny. I have been ordering these bully sticks from Rawhide Depot for quite some time and have never been disappointed before. There is usually one in the package that could be better but on the whole they have aways been an acceptable size. These are priced very well. I cannot afford to buy them anywhere else. My doggies may have to do without. I may take a chance again in the future but if I receive the same incredibly skinny ones I will never buy them again. The shipping was fast and there were no other glitches. I love that Rawhide Depot offers free shipping on this item if the minium purchase is met and it isn't very high - I think about $30 just off the top of my head. I always shop Rawhide Depot for dog treats and will continue to do so.
1,"No comparison with "" 12"" Best Bully Sticks"" made by BBS","Don't waste your dogs time with these skinny minnie ones. My bulldog puppy shreds any one of these in about 10 minutes.I ordered a pack of these only because Amazon discontinued the prime shipping on 12"" Best Bully sticks (by BBS).Absolutely no comparison. These guys dish the sticks out by the pound,not like BestBullySticks by the count, and the sticks by BBS are much thicker and keep my dog happily busy for a long time. Do yourselves a favor and get the good stuff from BBS."
1,Yikes!Overpriced!,"One star because my dogs loved them. BUT, 13 sticks in the package and 6 of them were thinner than a pencil!I usually feel that I can depend on cadet for both quality AND price- not in this case."
5,bully sticks,My dog loves these bully sticks! I only give them as special treats when she behaves well! A great treat!
2,Some of these are REALLY SKINNY,"I had bought these from Costco before and could pick out packages with nice thick sticks, so when I bought them on line I was disappointed that they were pencil thin. My mostly-toothless 16 pound dog can finish one in one day!"
2,"Item description should read ""Long Bull Sticks.""","Sticks are too thin. Maybe two of the sticks were a good size: 1/4 - 1/2 inch. Majority were very thin, even bendable. My puppy goes through them in minutes. Not what I expected."
1,Diarrhea in a package,"Dogs got diarrhea everytime I gave them one of these, threw them out, will not try them again, sorry for the dogs."
4,Very Good Value,Good treat. My new 4 year old rescued girl friend thinks they are great. Product would be better if thickness remained constant.
3,"Good value, but the smell is horrendous","My bulldog loves bully sticks more than anything. These sticks are a good value, and last quite a long time, but I must say these are probably the worst smelling bully sticks I've ever purchased. My dog sits beside me in the evenings while I watch TV or read, and I gag at the smell of these when she's near me. Will be looking for ""odorless"" sticks next time around."
1,wrong quantity,The package did not contain what they promised. It is hard to speak to a live person. Everything is done via email. I feel as though I am a victim of false advertising.
3,Large bully sticks.,My dogs love these. There are about 14 per package. Me female Boxer can chew through one in 5-10 minutes. My male Boxer can chew through one in 10-20 minutes. They do not last long at all. These are cheaper than the ones I have found around town. I hope to find an alternative to rawhide that last just as long as rawhide.
1,Smell is terrible!,Don't waste your money. I made a mistake that didn't read reviews before purchasing this. I am throwing this away. I am surprised about the high rating of this product.
1,THESE ARE..MADE..IN... C H I N A!!,I BOUGHT...I READ...THEY WENT IN THE GARBAGEIF IT DOESNT SAY...MADE IN THE USA....MY FUR BABIES DO NOT GET!GO TO FDA.GOV UNDER PETS TELLS YOU...NO PET FOOD FROM CHINA TO BE GIVEN TO YOUR PETS!
1,Do not buy,My dog is a 9 month old husky. He ate one in 5 minutes. All products from this company are horrible.
2,Raging Bull ?,Ever asked yourself where all these bull penises are coming from and how they are obtained?It is pretty crazy to kill animals artificially to feed their penises to other animals--guess that is the human species for you.
4,Pricey but good product!,"As another reviewer mentioned, it is expensive. But my dog loves it; these are a fail-safe method of keeping him busy for few hours atleast. With a very active Siberian Husky in cold Minnesota winters, thats always a plus!And also, couple of hours of chewing on one makes his teeth seem cleaner and whiter."
1,STINKY!,"I ordered from this company a few months ago and was happy, but I just ordered again and the bully sticks were so stinky that we threw away the entire package. In fact I tried to give them away to a friend with a dog and she wouldn't take them. They smelled up my entire house during a party which was a bummer for me and my guests. Now I'm looking for an odor-free alternative."
2,Most of them are thin as straws,"My dog loves these, however this past order the quality was poor. There were only about 4 in the bag that were at least a 1/2 inch in diameter, the rest were straw sized or thinner. She can chew tthrough those in 3 minutes. The larger ones keep her busy for an hour or two and she loves it. For the price, it's not worth buying them with so many skinny ones coming in the package. I might try it again and see if it was just a bad batch, but then again, I might not."
2,Not what they use to be,I've purchased these sticks a few times in the past and they have always been of good quality providing a long lasting chew. About half of the sticks in the last order were hollow and brittle and were gone in a matter of minutes.
2,"I think it is the ""Left Overs""","Random lengths, sizes and diameters.Not anything like the picture.My package had anywhere from 1/4"" dia. to 3/4"" dia. and over.Longest was 12""Shortest was 7-8"".Package had 15 each.I think these are the LEFT OVERS from the Premium Packages,and randomly put in the packages until it reaches ONE POUND of product.Best buy is at Costco, same brand and look just like the picture.On the positive side my Chihuahua's really liked them.I gave my Chihuahua one of the very small diameter sticks and she ate the whole thing in about 10 minutes.The ones at Costco are larger diameter and usually last the Dogs a few days."
3,Cadet Large bull Stick Dog Chew,It was okay but I was a little disappointed in the size of the portions. We have ordered this brand before and the individual sticks were thicker.
3,Particularly Smelly Batch,"We've ordered these bully sticks several times, and while they have always had a 'distinct' odor, this batch was beyond bad smelling. Luckily, this seems to make the dogs love them even more! But we can't stand to even be in the same room when the dogs are chewing on these...yuck!"
4,To expensive,I purchased these because my dog loves them. They were a reasonable price on amazon but by the time the purchase was over with the shipping cost was more than if I went to the store and purchased them. So I won't be purchasing them again.
3,they're ok,"I thought i was purchasing bully sticks, my mistake. I didnt cancel the order though and gave them a shot. The only problem with these sticks is that they break apart and get devoured very fast, unsually in a minute or two. For 15 bucks a back its heardly worth it when bully sticks for 25 bucks a pound can last much much longer. The dog goes like them very much, its just to costly."
1,You get what you pay for,I was disappointed in this product. In the past I have purchased a different brand which was a bit pricey. I thought the price of this product was reasonable and hoped the quality would be about the same but it is not. One of the other brand of bully sticks lasts my labradoodle a few days; he can finish one of this brand within 30 minutes!!!! You get what you pay for.
4,My dog loves these bully sticks.,My 11 lb. puppy loves these sticks and they keep him busy while I'm away at work during the day. The smell goes away and is something I'll put up with as it makes him so happy.
2,shorter than before,"This package contains about a dozen bull sticks, ranging from 12 inches to as short as 6 inches long. I have ordered those before and the length of previous orders is about 12 inches. This shipment contains more shorter sticks than longer one. I am disappointed at the shorter sticks as my dog is a large breed."
2,"12"" Inches? Yeah, Right","I've gotten these from my local pet store, and am very picky about getting the tallest, fattest one I can locate. Recently the price for one jumped from $2.99 to $4.99, which is ridiculous for a chew stick that lasts no longer than 24 hours, on a good day. I learned of this ""economy package"" and though there's many, many negative reviews, I thought I'd give them a whirl. Well, I am now in the market for new bull dicks altogether. Exactly half of them were 6"" tall and the 12"" tall ones were completely anemic. I myself, if this was my business, would be embarrassed to sell this product. There's clearly no quality control. I cannot speak to odor, as I've not opened the package yet, so I cannot comment on that. Maybe that would knock off the last star possible."
3,Not as good as it used to be,"My dog used to love these and would chew through an entire piece in less than an hour. With the new one, it's been over a week and there's still 3 inches left. They seem to be thinner, but they don't stink as much. However, if that's what my dog wants and I am buying it for him then I rather it be something he wants to chew even if it stinks."
3,just okay,"The value was there. but my dog barely touches these, which is rediculous. the pet store versions seem more desirable to him for some reason."
4,Siberian Huskies Love Bull Sticks,"My Siberian Husky, Jack loves these treats. Yeah, they smell. But to him it's like prime rib. Music to my ears."
3,"Thin, but a good amount","There are a lot of them, but the bag is made up of sticks about the width of a pencil with the exception of three thick ones. Much cheaper than buying in a store for sure."
5,"Thanks, Rawhide Depot","We are grateful to have a source that isn't outrageously expensive. And we looked up pizel, which we recommend that you don't really."
1,Poor fake,It reminds me of a cheap imitation patch that my grandmother would sow onto a hat. I have several MLB hats and this isn't anywhere near the same quality.
3,"Cute, but a little dissapointing","It's exactly like the picture, except smaller, and the metal feels kind of cheap, like it could break very easily. If I had seen this product in a store for $25 I would have passed it by, probably worth closer to to the $10-15 range. In the end it's cute and was a great gift for my Australian Shepherd loving friend, it just felt like a cheaper gift than it was."
2,Disappointing after a great live show,"I saw this band in Providence last year and took a copy of a three song demo they were handing out. ""Ira Jones..."", ""Sun"" and one other (can't remember the name) hooked me and I couldn't wait to hear ""Hillside"". Where's the spunk and attitude I saw on stage? I'm disappointed both in the guitar and vocal work, especially after hearing a much livlier sound on stage. I hope they can recapture some of that spirit in the studio for their next effort because I think they have great potential."
5,"Something in, something out","Some people I know, myself included, drink this album like it's the nectar of poppies flooding the plains of heaven. We play, swim. Rising ever higher, our minds melt into an absolute breakdown of musical convention. A band from 1998 England sounding like psychodelic alt country from the far future, warming your mind across the span of time. Go figure. This band does what it likes. Get it or don't. That said, their 2002 full-length, Bahama, isn't nearly as good."
2,snore along with arnold,"i'd heard great things about this record and was thrilled when i found it still wrapped for $1.99 in princeton. suffice to say that the measly two bucks i spent is the only thing keeping me in good humor regarding this record.i feel as though i've heard these songs a hundred times before and immediately forgot them only to hear another sad, breathy band try and foist them on me again. lethargic tempos, pedestrian acoustic strumming and unengaging melodies with a few odd, annoying castoffs thrown in for bad measure. too many other bands (pernice brothers, red house painters) do melancholy and wistful better to bother with arnold. love the cover though."
2,I wanted to like this album..,"""Fleas don't Fly"", the opening track unwinds all acoustic, Floydian, a great song. But it's largely downhill from there..few of the following tracks come close to touching that song's lulling insularity. Instead, we get the mildly annoying quiet/heavy dynamics of ""Ira Jones.."", the smarmy self-satisfied ('hidden tracks are easy to find, just let the disc play out' they offer helpfully on the back) air of the mock-country 'Country Bisquit' and so on. I don't like to put down bands in this manner, especially one as sonically capable as these guys, but that feel of 'almost there' that I get from this LP is way frustrating."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"This model of the Prodyne Cheese Slicer is somewhat of a disappointment. Although it slices cheese, it has much more difficulty in doing so than the earlier model which it replaced. For some reason, the wire seems ""dull"" and takes a long time to work its way through a firm cheddar."
3,Not The Quality I Expected,"I read the reviews and picked this slicer. It arrived and was a little smaller than I anticipated but I am ok with that because what I would be slicing was small.Immediately the slicer wire did not align with the slot in the wood so it would not cut through and past the cheese for a clean cut. After a couple of months messing with the alignment wire with little success I am now ready to rate this slicer. I believe I have been generous with a 3 star rating. The cuts are not clean and the overall fit and finish is nothing short of the result of mass production. It will cut cheese, I recommend looking for a better product."
4,Just Like SLiced Cheese,Hey - - It's a CHEESE Slicer.It slices cheeseAlso makes cheese crumbs - like all the other ones.Seems to work fine.Aesthetically pleasing..Happy with the purchase.Merlin
2,Cheesy,"As others have mentioned, this is a good looking slicer. Unfortunately, it has not been durable. I've had this product for something over a year, and over that time the cutting wire has stretched badly. It is no longer able to make even slices, or even cut though to the bottom of the cheese block. There is no way to tighten the wire."
4,Best way to slice cheese,I had been looking for a slicer like this in the stores and couldn't find one. I could not slice cheese evenly with a knife. This works extremely well.
4,love the cheese slicer works great,Works just like it should. Would have given it 5 stars but it does not clean itself and because you should not put it in the dishwasher.
3,Just OK,Its not as good as the one I used to have and bought this as a replacement. My old one lasted about 20 years. The wire slicer on this one seems flimsy and does not match up with the notch in the board with every slice. I was a bit disappointed when I used it. I would have bought a more expensive one to get a better product.
5,Awesome!,"I love this slicer. My friend has one and recommended it to me. It cuts the slices evenly and easily! The hand held ones always irritated me because there wasn't much control with it and my hand would always end up jammed against the counter. Plus, the slicer would never cut the end off right so you'd end up with a torn piece of cheese! Needless to say, I am thrilled with this new slicer."
2,A big disappointment,"A wood-slab cheese slicer such as this one is a must-have item in my kitchen. So when the wire broke on my old one after many faithful years of use I was anxious to replace it right away. This model looks attractive, but right away I noticed that the wire was not nearly as taut as that of my old one. It did not do a very good job cutting cheese. Moreover, the more I used it the looser the wire got, so that it would ""bottom out"" before finishing a slice. Eventually I found an extra one (of a model that is no longer available) in the attic that I'd forgotten I had, and I junked the Prodyne."
5,Great product,"I had a marble version of this same product, made by a different company, for years. Eventually, all the wires broke and I replaced them with thin picture wire. Then, however, the handle cracked and fell apart and it was time for something new.I decided to try something different since the marble piece had been a little bit cumbersome. Initially, I bought a really cool handheld piece with a wire and roller, as well as the ability to adjust the thickness of the slices. It was horrible. The wire wouldn't stay taught, it was unable to finish slices smoothly, and in general was a giant step backward.So, I thought I'd go back to what I new in the form of this product. However, I chose this one because I thought the wood board looked better than a marble one and I was hoping it would be a little lighter. I wasn't dissappointed. It looks great, works very well on all types of cheeses, and due to it's light weight stores very easily. Great product, I'm very pleased."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I'm torn... the slicer cuts very well. But after only a month it appears the varnish on coating on the wood is peeling off. It kind of makes the slicer look unappealing and I hope we're not accidentally eating the coating. That said, it stays in a cabinet and is cutting well."
5,Cheese Slicer,Received the Prodyne Beechwood Butcher Block Cheese Slicer. I bought one for my daughter-in-law also and she likes it as much as I do.Thank you.
2,Pleasant & Poo-Poo,"To be fair, over half of the selections sound like they were recorded in the 50's or 60's. These are pleasant Peter Pan recordings that exude the Christmas spirit. However, around seven of the songs (#3 and #13-18) are accompanied by what sounds like an inexpensive keyboard. Moreover, the singers on those seven songs are really bad! ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"" is listed as song #18 but is actually #3 on the CD. No big deal if just listening to but if you want to ""rip"" to computer, you'll have to manually retype most of the selections. It would have been better to have 15 great songs rather than 22 with seven annoying holiday selections. If you can find this CD at a very low price, it is worth it for the 15 notable Christmas songs. However, over $5 and you're duped!"
3,My daughter loves wearing this phone!,"This cell phone is a wonderful look for girls aged 3-6. I bought it for my daughter on her 4th birthday and she was the cutest kid at preschool. My only complaints are the horrible reception and lack of features. But if your daughter is just needing a simple cell phone to wear for a play-day, you have found the best!"
5,My steam curl iron,"Steam curling irons are hard to find, so I feel lucky to have found this one. I received it very promptly and love it, thank you so much, Toni"
2,Nowhere near the first CRIMSON RIVER,"Jean Reno,A fine actor. This movie just wasn't worthy of him. The first ""Crimson River"" was one of the finest filmed movies I have ever seen. The cinematograpy was gorgeous. Angels of the Apocalypse just didn't measure up. Sort of a Davinci Code with ""ninja monks""?"
2,"OLIVIER DAHAN, OPUS 4","** 2004. Written by Luc Besson and directed by Olivier Dahan. Two policemen try to understand why a group of months are committing ritual murders in the neighborhood of an old monastery. After the excellent first episodeThe Crimson Riversdirected by Mathieu Kassovitz in 2000, ANGELS OF THE APOCALYPSE is a big letdown. Christopher Lee undoubtedly accepted his role to pay his taxes, the French pop star Johnny Hallyday slurs four words, the whole movie seems illuminated by blue, red and green spotlights and there are some hectic months making a lot of diarrhoeal Chinese jumps in the background. Inadvisable."
3,Just a taste,"Don't judge Crimson Rivers, the first film by this follow-up. That was well made/directed. This film, although presenting what could have been a moody atmospheric mystery, is not at the same level. Uninvolving sometimes confusing direction is the downfall. It will provide a taste of the ""Crimson Rivers"" world but does not reach the same intriguing level."
3,Entertaining,"CR2 is like a hollywood movie in French. Sure it's corny, but it's entertaining. Reno is great (as always). It's nice to see Lee speak French (even though I doubt it's his voice.) If you need an entertaining thrill, than CR2 is it."
1,Crimson rivers: Angel of the apocolypes,I dont know how to review a movie i never got because it or the other 4 dvd's i purchased.
4,"...Five, Six, Grab Your Crucifix...","I've loved Karen Black ever since I sat rivetted by her performance in TRILOGY OF TERROR, back about a million years ago. THE PYX has Ms. Black as Elizabeth Lucy, a heroin-addicted prostitute, just trying to get by. Unfortunately, she gets drawn into a horrific situation, resulting in her demise. The movie opens at the point of her death. Christopher Plummer (Dolores Claborne) is a cop named Henderson who tries to unravel the mystery surrounding Elizabeth's homicide. We are taken along as things grow increasingly uneasy and disturbing. Henderson himself must come face to face w/ evil, and forces he cannot understand. His facial expression tells it all during the finalé! I like this one a lot, and found Ms. Black's music to be both haunting and tragic..."
4,Do you're research,"Did a ton of research before I bought this vacuum. I don't have much to compare it to, but I can give you some details.ProsThe thing sucks like a shop vac, and as advertises, never really looses that suctionBag less (amazing)The HEPA filter in it is washable (even more amazing)The engineering on this model is really nice. High quality materials, innovative designs.... little things that make it niceConsIts loudWhen might want to empty the container outside... it makes a big dust cloud if you are not careful"
2,AWFUL Sound!,"We purchased our Dyson DC14 for our new home. We had the carpets professionally cleaned first, and sometime in the second week of using the vacuum it started making this AWFUL grinding noise. I looked it up, and I'm not the only one with problem. Thankfully, I didn't have to deal with Dyson, I took it straight back to the store I bought it from. I'm going try a different Dyson, but was not impressed with this model. Although, I do have to say, that when it wasn't making the noise, it was an EXCELLENT vacuum :)"
3,"Enjoyable, but very abridged","I bought 'Der Kleine Hobbit' in Stuttgart to help me retain my German. I purchased this 'sonderausgabe' (special edition) audio book so I don't forget what German sounds like. It absolutely serves that purpose. However, it is abridged which makes it difficult to follow along in the text which is how I reinforce my German usage. Someone who wants to enjoy Der Hobbit and not spend the additional time of listening through an unabridged edition will do well to buy this version. If you want an audio rendition of the entire text, I would recommend looking elsewhere. It is produced with very solid production values and is certainly enjoyable and the passages it skips past do not harm the overall intregity of Tolkien's story. If you are an avid Tolkien fan who wants to explore his text in German, this may not be the right choice for you; but if you just want to spend some time listening to a quality rendition, this does the job."
1,"ouch, not good, buy Bo instead","George picked the worst way to show his voice.Songs are so boring and he doesn't stay in the right key!Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad, yuck for Georgie!"
5,Creme Of The Idol Crop,"Just my opinion, however. :-) George Huff has to be the most likebale, most marketable of the Idol finalists I've seen. This is a good effort, but as someone said, George can make anything sound good. I just hope he does a *real* solo project in the furture. He's a rare voice. Pick this up if you dig George..."
4,One Great Christmas Album--One Great voice!,"I always liked the voice of George, along with my favorite Idol Jennifer Hudson and was hoping for George Huff to release a normal Cd for his Debut, but still this cd is really good for a Christmas album. He has a very nice voice and I really like his incredible personality and charisma."
3,I can't wait until George's FULL album!,"I was a big fan of George Huff on AI3, he was great especially with upbeat songs like Ain't To Proud to Beg! His almost rhaspy, excellent vocals are truly impressive, enjoyable, enchanting and just great. I can't wait until George's full album is released, as he can reveal his true potential (not just a Christmas EP)"
3,ok...but not good,"To make it clear, I am not the the kind of person who likes only one idol and hate all the idols. I think this cd is not good at all because George's style doesn't fit with these songs at all. Honestly, I think Silent Night and O Holy Night was a bit horrible and there were a few notes that were off....maybe it's just his style doesn't fit with these songs...i hope his singing gets better for other songs.Tell it on the Mountain is a good performance though. There is feeling in it and certainly power as well."
5,What a series!!!!!,"If you can imagine what a thrill it was to grow up in Detroit in the 50's and 60's, and you miss a time when starting pitchers finished games, closers were just that, watch this video! In 1968, a rt handed shortstop who hit .230 against southpaws, and .061 against righthanders was called a MINOR LEAGUER. Forget the fact that Denny McClain won 31 games, this series featured a centerfielder (MIckey Stanley) playing shortstop! Mickey Lolich won 3 games for Detroit the last on 2 days rest. Pretty good for a guy who was right handed and taught himself to pitch with his left hand after a childhood injury. Mickey also hit his first career homerun in this series. Considering the fact that most of these guys had off-season jobs to pay the bills, now this was baseball. Two great teams, two great cities, playing a game out of love. GET IT!!!!!"
5,"The smartest, funniest show to ever live past one season...","That's right, I'm making that claim: Wonder Showzen is the smartest, funniest show to ever last longer than one season. Really, I'd say ""ever"", but who cares. Now, some people will not like this show, but for those who appreciate dark comedy, you will know what I mean. It may take two or three episodes to get on WS's wavelength, but once you're on it, you will agree that it is unsurpassed. Sometimes the show can seem a bit dumb, but keep at it. If you are one of the lucky ones who can enjoy this masterpiece, you will never enjoy anything else as much. Every month, I break out both seasons and watch it all the way through: It's that good. However, I'd suggest that you start with season 2 if you're planning on seeing this show for the first time. It's a bit better than season 1, and maybe more accessible.Do not let this show pass you by. Everyone should own this DVD."
2,funny but disappointing,"This had the potential of being a cutting-edge compilation of bizarre satire and funny skits. It just missed---too repetitive, and just missing the real humor. Robot Chicken was far superior."
4,the puppets kind of creep me out.......,"wonder showzen is a perfect for anyone who is sick and twisted, or just has a good taste in mtv comedy. i love all 8 episodes and i can't wait to buy it. in my opinion wonder showzen and the andy milonakis show are the best ""sic em friday"" tv shows on mtv. i've been waiting for this to come to dvd sinse i saw the first epiode. i'm not telling you to buy it but...it's the best show and needs to be loved by someone(or a million)buy it!!!"
4,"I love this show, but Season 1 is missing the pilot","I bought a bootleg of season 1 at a comic shop a while back, and it contained a 9th epsiode pilot called ""Kids Show."" This pilot was similar to episode 1, but things were arranged differently and Clarence skit was completely different, longer, and far superior to all the Clarence skits in season 1."
3,She's worth watching,"The basic premise as explained by other reviewers was made believable in the movie. The actors made the brother/sister connection work. Unfortunately it takes up to scene 13 before any good sex enters the movie. From there on the story is much more interesting, especially the kitchen scene; and her action when she realizes their parents know what's been going on."
5,clap clap clap,"wow, what can I say... I'm impressed. FINALLY after many soft-core movies this is the best one by far. Not only the sex parts are really good but the whole story will get you into it. Yeah, I'm the kind of guy who fast forward to get to the sex scene parts and never cared about the story, but this one actually caught me. Renne Rea (the one on the picture) reminds me of Britney Spears, so.. yeah.. THAT IS QUALITY."
4,Cool movie!,"In a genre crowded with mediocrity this little gem delivered on all levels! Great looking women (although I would've given 5 stars if there were more than 4 of them), nice ""action"", EXCELLENT story, and quite a bit of craft involved with it's production. Also the fun DVD extras were a nice surprise, it's like hanging out on the set. I did a credit search and it seems like the Producer and Director were responsible for a bunch of Playboy's better titles."
2,Simple,"That's a good idea to make a movie where forbidden things happen, but the production was very simple."
1,"Terrible movie, save your money!",I have to agree with the other 1 star reviewer. This movie is terrible and not worth buying. Not a good movie for female viewers!!! Now I am stuck with this piece of garbage.
2,Weak acting and weird story.,"Other than the firm sexy bodies and the steamy erotic scenes I don't find another reason to watch the movie. I was particularly astonished with the weak acting capabilities of the cast and the weird ending of the movie. What was intended to be a twist at the end of the movie, turned out to be more of a confusing unrealistic tease!I don't know when are we going to get a decent erotica movies that respect the viewers' mentalities and do not undermine the audience expectations."
1,Don't Bother,"I suffered through since I had paid for the DVD, but it went in the trash bin as soon as it ended."
4,JD struts his stuff,"JD comes out from nowhere to take the music world by storm. Everyone of his 12 songs feature some other big name like Mariah Carey in the incredible song ""Sweetheart"" and Jay-Z in the chart topper ""Money Ain't A Thing."" JD also teams up with Snoop Dogg, Slick Rick, Warren G, Nas, Ma$e, Da Brat, Usher, DMX and more.It makes you look forward to see what JD has to offer next."
4,Hanging w/ my girl Mariah Carey!?!?,"I was really looking for the single ""Sweetheart"" by Mariah Carey. Sadly disappointed that there is not a single for this out yet, I managed to find out that if I wanted to groove to my girl Mariah on her latest single ""Sweetheart,"" I had only one option -- buy Jermaine Dupri's premiere album. I liked the music video w/ Mariah showing her incredible body and thought that it was cool the way JD was throwing them lyrics down. I checked out this cd and I give it two thumbs up 'cause JD got it goin' on. If you have any kind of nice system in your ride, you gotta groove to this. A nice added surprise were all of the guest appearances --- especially Slick Rick! The profanity on it is a bit harsh - but all in all it adds its element of humor much like the way Chris Rock uses profanity in his comedy act. If you want something to make your head nod, then rock w/ JD and Mariah -- they are on fire!"
2,just weak,"this albums got some catchy rhymes and might keep u listening for a couple of days but overall its just plain weak. he has a terrible voice and the guests suck, slick, mase, lil kim, jay z and nas? what the hell get some real mcs, at least he has x and snoop but even they arent as tight as usual on this cd. im not gonna say this is a bad cd, just weak thats all. its an average cd that isnt worth buying but it isnt s*** like those bad boy cds. u want real hip hop, go get some no limit or 2pac, RIP pac, im out, peace"
1,Whoa was I stupid,"This cd is awesome. Jazzy Hoes is an great song. But it doesn't end there, this cd is full of awesome songs and is a must get if you like rap. Yay that's a lot of bs. I typed this a long time ago when I was an ignorant, mainstream rap listener. In actuallity, this cd sucks. Jermaine Dupri is contributing to the destruction of rap culture."
1,wack,puffy imitations is not flattering.this album is one big waste. sweetheart is a direct bite of honey and the other cuts just fill like filler.boring.
3,Good production but weak lyrics at points.,Life in 1472 starts off strong with all-star guest performances by Nas (Turn It Out) and Jay-Z (Money Ain't A Thing). These are the strongest tracks on the album . While the production is superior the rest of the disk is merely average. I expected more from JD.
5,Hot to Death,"Every track on this album is hot. I cant even choose my favorites cause every track is so tight. This cd features a list of basically whose who in the hip hop world. With hot dance beats and JD's unique voice adding to the flavor, this album blows up."
5,Great Album,"This album is unbelievable from start to end. The appearances of DMX, Slick Rick, Snoop, and Mase make this album even better. The duet with Mariah is one of the best and unexpectedly dirty songs. Slick Rick makes a great comeback. JD deserves credit for such a well thought out and perfectly executed album."
4,Life In 1472 Should Be Bought In 1998,"The only comparision between Life In 1472 and Puff Daddy's ""No Way Out"" is that they are producers, they try to rhyme and they use a lot of R&B based loops. And that's where the comparisons end. In my opinion this album is better than Puff's because of 3 reasons. 1 - he didn't use only people in his camp. Slick Rick, Snoop Dogg, Nas and Jay-Z are enough reasons to buy this album. 2 - he didn't produce all of the tracks. DJ Premiere and a few others did some work too. 3 - his rap tracks are solid. Tracks like Don't Hate On Me, Get Your Ish Right and Protectors Of 1472 are mad tight! In this day and age of Hip-Hop there are many emcees who can handle 10 songs solo so I don't see what the big deal is that this album is full of appearances."
1,J.D. is wack,"When I bought this CD I thought it was going up to be tight cause the songs he did with other artist was bumpin. This album is straight up some weak sh**. Please, PLease do not call this hip-hop. You don't want to buy this garbage. If you are, just buy his singles. You'll save money."
2,A vanity album. Not good at all.,"I thought we had heard enough when Puffy took the mic. I guess not. Every song on this album is driven by a formula, nothing sounds original and that style of rap is very tired now. Someone with his production credits should have come tighter. Not recommended. Peace \/"
5,The best cd that ever came out from so-so def recordings,JD has a great rythem and style during the beat dropping and his lyricaly aclamed style. When this record comes out it will be popular among many age groups and clubs etc. Well i wish luck to jd and hope his style of rap can esclate to another level in is next solo efort as the c.e.o. so-so def.
4,This cd is one of the best I've ever had!,"This album is just great especially the songs ""Money Ain't a Thang"", ""Fresh"", ""Turn It Out"", and ""You Get Dealt Wit"". Overall it's an album that you just gotta buy. It's awesome. Personally I think J.D. is a great rapper to not just producer, I like his voice. If you haven't already bought it, do so right now. Hey it's what all your friends are talkin' about.(Slick Rick is awesome) I tried rating it five, but it wouldn't work. It came out as 4, but I give it a 5 even though it doesn't say so."
5,"It Is A PHAT, PHAT, PHAT CD!!!!!!!!!",Jermaine Dupri has proved that producers can be gerat rappers. The best rap CD in years.
1,Kim Anderson,"Bought this book thinking it contained photographs from the famed photographer, Kim Anderson, whom specialized in photos of children. The actual pictures in this book do not appear to be from Kim Anderson and his name appears no where in the credits. Though the book contains some quality, on topic pictures, I was somewhat disappointed."
2,"Great music, unfortunately all re-recordings.","I've been a Merle Haggard fan all my life and this CD is about as great as he gets. But, if you want the original recordings of these hits, look elsewhere."
1,worth it if it is free,"If you get it for free, it is worth an hour while you are driving. If you pay for it, it is worth the money in a coaster. The voice is very dry and puts you to sleep and what he talks about isn't much better."
4,cool,"Its a great mouse, especially if u like games. It has 8 programable buttons and has a laser optical eye. The only downside is that its got a cord. But i love it."
3,Sorry He's Gone,"Rick was a great talent - his importance to the success of The Band and their place in history was clearly understated/unrecognized during their salad days and beyond. Unfortunately, neither that nor his passing make this CD any better. Not the legacy he would have liked, methinks."
5,Great quality,"Nice and simple solution for making the trail. Like it's bright colors, as it makes it easier to see even small pieces between the bushes and trees."
1,"superficial, judgmental, and egoistic","the author did some short advice clips on cable tv. she would go like, this guy is a jerk, that guy is a 0. these type of guys, just brush him off. her ideas were like, when he calls, does he have a plan in mind, if he does, 10 points. if not, 0, loser! i can see some guys just follow some socially acceptable, pretentiously polite and smart moves and pass the test and turn out to be a totally bad husband. while some honest and sincere guy can get misjudged and go into the ""just brush him off"" category."
3,"Some good, and not so good","Asking yourself questions about the man you are with is a very good idea, so this book should be read. But, some of the questions are either dumb, or are just common sense. One of the questions you should ask yourself about him that really irritated me is: How does he treat his mother. If he doesn't talk to her much, then that means he would make a lousy mate?! I don't think so! I have met some women who weren't very good mothers, so this question should be left out. This is a good book, but you should use your common sense with some of the questions. The author doesn't know men as much as she lets on. This should be treated as just a starter book."
2,Italian cd defective,Sounded like a scratch but was continuous throughout the producrion. Ithe interuption in the dialogue was very distracting. Would like replaced
4,Pure class!,Burt Wolf gives a different perspective on traveling & we enjoyed this very much. What we did not enjoy was the cruise DVD's. You really do not get to see much of the countries he is visiting. It is more about the cruise ship & shows how limited you are at what you can expect to see when traveling by ship through Europe.
3,Candid review,"The book is lacking in definitive pictures, a general over view. Not waht someone would need if checking for authenticity, was a bit dishearted with the book. Does compliment other sources."
3,Good Entry Level Airbrush,"I bought this airbrush as a replacement for one just like it. The price was good and the shipping was fast. As a medium quality airbrush, this deal would be hard to beat."
5,Greatest book ever,I love this book because all my books on my Kindle Fire are also so BORING but when I got it I tried to read it in a day but it was 2 days.......... but one more thing the title does not match the book but I love it anyway
4,Mallory on the move,I really wish it was a longer book .I loved itI am excited to read more awesome Mallory books
3,Tea scoop,Smaller than I expected but good enough for my purpose for holding loose tea. Only problem is that the closing latch if very hard to open and close. Otherwise a nice little jar.
4,Step Back in Time,"An interesting collection of actual articles regarding base ball, primarily from newspapers and magazines. At times, the style of writing can get wordy. Still there is good information about the beginings of the game."
1,"Great kettle idea, too bad it exploded in the microwave",Got this kettle as a wedding gift. I used it and hand washed it as directed. LOVED using it for teas and other quick hot water drinks and meals. Today put it in the microwave and POP! BURNT smell and SMOKE everywhere. Thank goodness my microwave didn't catch fire or anything else. Love the idea but not worth the potential fire hazard.
1,Burnt Through,"I placed the water level at 2 cups and using the microwave setting for hot water two cups, and started the heating process. I have used this kettle for about six months. The kettle whistles just as the microwave finishes. The whistle stopped last week, but the water was still hot...then today I noticed a strange odor. The lid of the micro-kettle has a small toothpick sized hole burnt from the center to the outside of the lid. Water was on the glass plate of the microwave with black specs in it. The pieces have been washed by hand or on the top shelf of the dishwasher w/out heated drying. I think there is a problem with the product. I wish my little Wal-mart glass micro kettle hadn't shattered when I dropped it, after 12 years it never had a problem. This was the only product on the market similar to what I had..."
5,Perfect Wings on the First Try!,"Got my fryer yesterday, fried up my first batch of wings today. Couldn't be happier. I was concerned with some of the reviews I read about the unit not getting the oil hot enough resulting in soggy food but 15 minutes and my wings were a perfect golden brown nice and crispy just the way I like them. Thrilled with this fryer so far."
4,Thanks for the great Reviews they were very helpful,I agree with the previous review that the fryer defintely does not come up to the correct temperature but after moving the oil around it seems to work great. It does take some getting use to but I am really starting to enjoy this fryer. I found that if I put the cover on while frying chicken it comes out great. I also did some french fries and salmon and no problem the taste was good. I think the company needs to go back and look at the temperature issue but once it gets going good this fryer does a great job. Thank everyone for your review of this product because I read everyone of them before deciding to purchase and I am so glad I did. Thanks Amazon for giving us this forum I really do check out the reviews before purchasing a lot of the products that I use.
3,Second deep fryer I have owned,I had a single basket Delonghi that was a dual zone and cooked better but the electronics went twice on the unit costing $80 each time. I liked the way this dual basket looked so I gave it a try. It cooks pretty decent but not as good! One good thing is the simple controls which haven't failed.
2,poor design,"I bought this fryer based on all the good reviews which I'll have to disagree with. There is no divider in the middle of the baskets, so you have to use tons of oil-even if your just using the one basket. There is a cover but it's useless because you can't open and close it while your frying. It also feels cheap and flimsy-very light. We don't use it. Should have sent it back!"
5,Simply amazing.,"We love this unit to death, and what I mean by that is if we keep frying foods at this rate we really will love this thing to death."
4,Good Quality,This product meets all the expectation I had. I have used it about ten times now and it works very well.
4,Deep Fry,The unit is nicely designed. However the baskets are flimsy- could have been more solid. Otherwise its just what the doctor order! Then he advised me against fried foods! LOL
4,Presto 5466 0ProFry Stainless-Steel Dual-Basket Immersion-Element 12-Cup Deep Fryer,"Presto 5466 0ProFry Stainless-Steel Dual-Basket Immersion-Element 12-Cup Deep FryerI'm very happy with this purchase, I wish it was all stainless-steel though, but again for the $money$ you can't go wrong.I would buy it again if i had too."
1,Could not be made any cheaper if you tried,We purchased the previous model of this fryer in 2004. It was well built and did a great job. However the control burned out and we decided to replace it with another one. The material and construction of the new one is awful. The only thing that prevents us from returning it is that the control fits on the older model. Presto it appears no longer build quality. One can rest assured that when we need to replace the one we now have it will not be one made by Presto.
3,Presto Deep Fryer,Size wise it's a great fryer. The only regret I have is the temperature control tops out at 375 degrees. I have recipes that call for 400 degree oil. Wouldn't have purchased this model had I realized.
2,Don't Buy This One,"I bought 2 of these to fry chicken legs and tenders for a school function. Everything about them seemed easy and how hard could this be. Well, we had these 2 going along with a similar Waring fryer and ended up just using the Waring fryer. Like several reviews say, this doesn't get hot enough and that's critical when you are frying. I wish I could return these two as it's doubtful we'll use them again given our terrible experience."
3,fryer,This takes too much oil and is much larger that I pictured. Probably my fault for not reviewing specs closer
2,didn't like it.,don't know why. i think i am not a deep fryer person. I thought i would be. but not.
3,Size matters.,"It is too early to rate this product as I haven't had an occasion to try it. It's a pretty simple, time-tested principle, so I don't expect any problems. It seems to be pretty well made so I expect it to last. The one mistake I made is to, once again, choose a product that is way too large for a bachelor who only entertains on occasion and fried foods are best, in my opinion, served freshly cooked.You may check back in a few months for a rating if you choose.DOC"
1,very unhappy,"We purchased this based on the Amazon ratings, despite the fact that most people say it doesn't get to optimal temps. And it certainly didn't in my case. We gave it plenty of time to heat up, and made sure the potatoes were prepared exactly as suggested. We had about 2 baking potatoes worth of fries, didn't seem like very much. As soon as we put them in, the temp dropped to 300, and it never came back up. We left the food in twice as long as recommended, but they never cooked all the way through. These were not huge, think fries either."
2,Condition received,"When I received this product and upon further review of it. The condition in which I received the item was not what I would consider great or good condition. The outer stainless steel hold box has some dents in it as well, the metal box that holds the oil itself is broke near the top. I can still utilize this product and like the performance. If I hadn't already thrown the box away and shredded the paperwork I would have sent it back for exchange."
3,Convenient 2 basket frier,"I have only used it once so far, but I found it worked well. Convenient having 2 baskets for cooking different food.Although advertized as having fast recovery time for heating the oil, I found it took rather a long time to recover when putting in frozen fries for example.I tried to do the double fry method for cooking fries, but because of the time taken to get the oil back to temperature, even with partly cooked fries, they still didn't come out crisp."
3,presto 5466 pro fry,BECAUSE of the size it uses more than gallon of oil. food does taste a little oily. use must have to use this often to get the use of the oil. should have personally gone for the smaller one.
5,Presto 05466 Stainless Steel Dual Basket Pro Fry Immersion Element,We have used this item so many times since we have purchased it. everything comes out perfect. We just love it.
4,Good Investment,"We had a fish fry and it was great being able to serve hot fish to everyone. I rotated the baskets so that some fish would be frying at the same time some fish would be ready to eat. Clean up was a breeze. After the oil cooled down, I picked up the inner container and strained it through cheesecloth. All the little pieces of coating were caught and the grease didn't smell fishy! The only catch is there is no lid to keep the oil from spattering. However, if you don't overfill the baskets it should work just fine. I would recommend this to my friends."
4,Presto deep fryer,"I am very pleased with this product. The ordering was easy; the product was shipped and received quickly; no damage other than the metal liner of the top is not connected on all sides, but I decided I can live with that as opposed to shipping it back. Cleanup is easy."
5,Awesome,Works well and love being able to multitask. Baskets are spacious and well built. Have had no issues of any kind with my fryer. Would work well with a small fish frying party.
3,beaten up,"This came with only a shrink wrap on the box. When my son opened it this morning, it was beaten all to pieces. Don't know if it was dropped or what, but wish I had opened it before I wrapped it. Loves the product, but it will have to be replaced. Next time, pad it with foam or something in another box. Very disappointed!!!!"
2,fries good but other downfalls,"This Fryer is very large which is what we were looking for. However we didn't realize the things that our old one had that helped alot. The lid that latches with a filter is very important, if you don't want your whole house to stink like fry oil. This has a lid that just sets on top but it doesn't filter anything. After we made fried chicken one night all of our coats that were hanging in the back room where we fry had to be washed they stunk so bad. Our back room is even separated with a swinging door but the smell filled the house and the bedrooms smelled like grease when we went to bed. Also a downfall is it is hard to drain the oil our of this one. But without the lid snaping tight on it, if you leave the oil in it, it smells all the time. Another downfall is there is no timer on it, which our other digital one had. All and all our old smaller digital fryer had many other pluses that we didn't even know were important."
2,Magnetic cord problems,"Had problems with the magnetic cord staying in place, the first time I used it. The magnetic cordwould not keep constant contact thus the oil was not always up to the 350 degree setting.The french fries took for ever to fry and chicken too...not impressed with this fryer because of thecord not keeping in place. Otherwise, the fryer has many features that are great."
4,Good Fries,Heats up pretty fast concerning it takes a gallon of oil to fry in. First batch of fries came out nice and crispy. One reason I double fry fries. Easy clean up not so easy if you filter the oil after each use which I do. The oil last longer. The baskets and immersion element clean up easily. It was messy for me filtering the oil. I put the oil container in the sink put a funnel into the oil container and put a metal coffee strainer in the funnel. I used a paper cup to remove most of oil from the fry tank then to the filter and oil container. Be sure the oil has cooled down. Don't want to have those fried fingers. The next step was picking up the frying tank and pouring the remaining oil into the filter/container. Took some time to do this and spilled some oil and hands became oily. Next time I'll use nitrlie gloves or similar. Even with the hassle of cleaning this fryer is far better than my old fryer.
1,be careful,"We bought this to replace the old one that we had, and thought wow this is great. Well, that lasted for about 10 minutes. This thing had some sort of coating or something on it that made it smoke every single time we used it. We thought it just needed to burn it off and be seasoned.......but no it just kept doing it. We figured we would live with it until one night after using it my eyes started to burn from the smoke, and an asthma attack like I have never had before followed a few hours later. I haven't had a single problem with my asthma since we stopped using this. We even again took this outside and tried to burn off whatever it was that was causing the smoke, but 2 hours later it still smoked. So to me this product is not worth the money or the potential trip to the hospital."
5,Great product and Very fast shipping,"If you are looking for buying a deep fryer, you should buy this one. It works great and it is very easy to clean the whole thing. Love it!"
5,GREAT!!!!!,"The dual baskets are a great way of pleasing everyone. You can use 1 basket to fry your items crispy and the other basket for light frying to please everyone. I have used it several times and have no serious complaints. It takes about 15 minutes for it to heat up and a few times a couple pieces of fish stuck to the basket, but it was nothing major. Nothing is without some flaws, but mine are very minor. If you do alot of frying I highly recommend it."
5,The best deep fryer we ever had,"Its fast, easy to clean and cooks evenly. It works flawlessly and as an engineer I can not see anyway it could be improved. The large basket will fry enough french fried potatos for the whole family in less time it takes the make the hamburgers. The submersible heating elements is the only way to have a deep fryer for direct heat transfer to the oil and I would reccomend using peanut oil. The Amazon price is the bargain of the century for this product. It was such a wonderful unit that I bought one for my sister-in-law for Christmas."
1,"Tried every suggestion, can't get it over 280 degrees","I've read all the reviews and discussions here and tried all the suggestions, stirring the oil, etc.It is rare that I can get this thing over 300 degrees after an hour (I'm using a quality candy thermometer to check temp).I'm going to call Presto tomorrow to see what my options are.My only other option is to unscrew the temp sensors from the heating elements and let them hang in the oil. Otherwise I hope I can return this, I've had it a few months now."
4,Deep fat fryer,This Presto product has beat my expectation! I would reccommend it to all who enjoy deepfat fryers.
3,presto profry,"am excited about using this fryer!i was VERY disappointed, though, that one side of the fryer was BENT.....but i did not want to go through the process of returning it......"
3,fryer,"Like most fryers, it loses heat when food is dropped in, and it takes a while for it to get back to temperature. good for small portions, but don't try frying for a large party, you'll be in the kitchen all day. Overall , decent product."
5,Presto ProFry,Larger than expected and cooks a lot of food at once. Heated up quickly and cooked the food evenly. Love this deep fryer.
5,PRESTO DEEP FRYER,"I bought one for Christmas last year. Everyone griped about how much counter space it takes up and the large amount of cooking oil needed.Today, almost a year later, this appliance is the most used one in our kitchen. We love this thing and use it for seafood,chicken, pork chops ,burritos,corn dogs and many other things. If you like fried foods, you will never part with this jewel. Don't wait, BUY IT NOW. (I also paid a hundred bucks for it) It's priced lower now."
4,Great for 5 years!,Well I have had this fryer for 5 years. I have to purchase another one due to the fryer shutting off. I have to push it against my cabinet in order to get it to stay on. What do I expect after two moves and tons of usage. Over the five years I loved this machine. It worked great and was easy to clean. I definity got every penny it was worth out of it.
2,If you want to open a wound,"I misread when I saw this. I thought this would be the facts behind the OCB: how it happened, the trial, how the victims' family mourn. Instead the narrator immediately says, ""Judge these uncovered facts for yourself."" This whole work is about whether other groups, detestable ones, helped McVeigh accomplish this tragedy. That's not a question upon which I really want to dwell. Those who love conspiracy theories may love this work. However, I was looking for something inspiring that would help viewers overcome and survivor terrible events. I thought ideas would be offered about how we can prevent an OCB from ever happening again. You won't get this here. This is a dark, dark, dark work on an equally dark subject."
3,A super mish-mash,"Here's another of many Blue Öyster Cult compilations and, like each of them, it features just a few things the others around it lack. In this case, those curious to see what ""The Red and the Black"" would sound like if the band skipped the intro and jumped straight into the main riffing - or maybe that's just the edit - can find out here in its live form. ""7 Screaming Diz-Busters"" is also a nice surprise, but ""Cities on Flame With Rock and Roll"" and ""Shooting Shark"" are curiously absent from the line-up, despite both making a fair climb up the charts during their respective decades. All things considered, it's not the worst place for a BÖC newbie to start; it's easily better thanBest of the Blue Öyster Cult, but pales in comparison toDon't Fear the ReaperandWorkshop of the Telescopes."
3,I love BOC too much to play this CD,"Listen to me carefully- Blue Oyster Cult is MUCH more of an album band, which means, picking up any one of their regular albums is guaranteed to give you a very consistent and listenable experience. Super Hits just gives you the icing on the cake, or the free food sample at the supermarket.Buy their first three albums to hear what it was like hearing a band mixing progressive hard rock with punk, and pick up their other albums to hear a band that's just plain weird and lyrically interesting. Don't buy Super Hits, because even though the song choices are excellent, Blue Oyster Cult is so much more than what's offered here. You know it's true."
2,"WHY, WHY, WHY!",This is a pretty good collection of BOC'S best songs. But you can hit people over the head for so long before they yell ouch. May this be the last greatest hits album of BOC.
5,Classic!,"This is an awesome cd! The vocals and guitars are legendary! Blue Oyster Cult is a great band, and this compilation, produced by Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden fame, includes some of B.O.C.'s best. Definetly worth owning; for anyone who loves great pop/metal music!"
4,"Great watch: super solid, maybe too solid","I've had this watch for several years, and it has always run perfectly. It is totally accurate (deviates by less than 2 sec/month from atomic clock) and it has never run out of power since I've had it---even when left in a drawer for months. Very slick styling, lots of compliments on the looks of the watch, and it has very nice night visibility. Very heavy stainless case and band is literally bulletproof (or at least quite scratchproof.) So heavy that it might take a little getting used to, but nicely rounded links are quite comfortable, and the clasp is as smooth as any I've seen."
2,Don't expect Whigs album,"I bought this based on my love of the Whigs and while Greg D.'s voice brings some familiarity to this album, it does not compare to previous Whigs material. I did enjoy a number of the songs on this record though. There is that mix of mystery and style in most of the songs that I am accustomed to hearing from the Whigs but from a ""good tune"" perspective the album sounds flat at times. I know this album was not meant to be a Whigs album and it is supposed to have that quiet, laid back, smokey room kind of sound. It accomplishes that but the songs just aren't that good."
5,a fresh sound in an era of copycat music,without a doubt one of the best albums that i have heard. i initially bought it because i have been a casual howling maggie/afghan whigs fan and i heard one of the cuts on the local modern rock station. my only regret is that i did not get an opportunity to see this band during their short tour.oh yeah....the five star system does NOT do this album justice :)
5,Dulli does it again,"Greg Dulli, frontman of soul rockers The Afghan Whigs, turns in what is pretty much his first solo record. With able help from Harold Chichester and the ever soulfull Shawn Smith, this is one groove filled afair. Some of these songs sound like lost cuts from ""Black Love"". The only weak point is ""Love"", which is a rewrite and recording of ""Black Love"" which was on the ""Monument Ave"" soundtrack. The original was stark and sinister compared with the electro/drum version here. For those who care, the original can be heard over the closing credits of ""Monument Ave"". All together a great record to get down to and tide you over until the Whigs next one--hope they tour..."
1,I HATED THIS BOOK!!!!!,"I did not like this book at all. This is one of the wrost Love Story books that I have read. The characters in this story were awful. Lilly was so full f herself, she thought that any guy should be sssoooo greatful just to gt a date with her. She didn't even change in the end either. And Charlie don't even get me started on him. Purple converse. Need I say more. Usually it only takes me a day to read these stories but it took me about a week to read this one. Don't waste your time or money on this book. If (god help you) you do read this story go to the libabry. If you want to read a good Love Story then read ""At First Sight"" by Elizabeth Chandler."
3,The Day I Met Him,This was an ok story about a popular girl and a mechanic that started dating because of a bet. It wasn't bad but other Love Stories are better.
4,Book good,"This book was cool, but I've read better....(They really need to get a better cover)anyways some people are gonna love it...some might hate it I liked it but others are better"
5,new lid,I broke my original lid for the casserole almost 2 years ago. I'm thrilled to be able to find a replacement lid. It fits perfectly.
1,Wrong product,"I ordered dish w/lid. Received lid only on the day after the item was supposed to arrive, with wrong invoice. I was credited the cost after mailing item back."
3,NV Stands for NOT VOICE,"First I would like to say that the description on Amazon is wrong. Hopefully they will fix it by this review, but this modem is NOT a voice modem. NV stands for NOT VOICE. This was the main reason for me to buy an $80 modem as most $5 win modems will do just fine.Now, the three stars is not because there was a bad description and I got the wrong modem, that is not the modem's fault. For faxing, it worked fine. However, we also use the modem for auto dialing in Outlook and for whatever reason, Outlook could not get the modem to work. Out $5 win modem worked just fine, but this modem would not. This problem occurred in two different computers with two modems.I am hoping to by the Voice modem from the same manufacture since they do get good reviews and they do have Vista x64 drivers updated 3/19/2009."
5,Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!,"Anoushka Shankar is a master in her field. You don't have to be of her ethnicity to appreciate and relate to her music. Anoushkar's melodic tunes are a must to help me unwind after a long day. It's also great at setting a romantic mood. This album is terrific. I highly recommend this album as well as that of her latest, ""Traveller"", where she fuses indian classical music with flamenco from some of today's leading Spanish artists. A MUST buy."
3,return to tana mana,"Very pleasant fusion of Indian and western traditions. Brings to mind her father's great experiment, Tana Mana, which was truly groundbreaking when released in the 70s. Anoushka has a very nice expressiveness to her sitar playing that I quite enjoy. A solid three stars."
3,Nothing Special,"If Anoushka Shankar were not Ravi Shankar's daughter, she would never have a recording contract. She needs to spend much more time studying the fundamentals of sitar and learn to improvise on her own. This album is nothing special and sounds like New Age music of 20 years ago. The real masters of fusion music are Zakir Hussain and L. Subramaniam. They spent many years first learning the fundamentals of Indian classical music and then expanded into fusion. Ms. Shankar is a little too young and inexperienced to do the same and needs to get out of the spotlight and learn her art for a few years more."
1,barely Rise!,"If Rise is what is trumped up as Ravi Shankar's legacy, it is quite sad! I am not writing as a purist or someone who even has much knowledge of Indian music. I do know good music and this barely makes it to Bollywood, barely!!"
1,Musak!,"This CD is backgrdound ""musak"" best served in an Indian restaurant as one reviewer has appropriately noted!"
2,--,"Well, I hate to admit it, but the album is slightly over-hyped.No doubt, Anoudhka Shankar is talented, and quite humble about it,but..I mean, for her age, she is amazing ,and an excellent youth icon.But as someone mentioned, the area she lacked was probably that she was too rehearsed..and not very spontaneous.The music sounds amazing live because of all the energy the musicians radiate.Not as thrilled with it on cd.But if you need something for when you're driving, or meditating or just relaxing, its worth a buy.Some of the pieces just tap into your inner mind and flash pictures of serenity and peace.For what she is aiming at , it is an excellent attempt.I didnt give it more than two stars simply because there are musicians more skilled than her."
1,tasteless music,"This is a tasteless CD that is like bad movie track music. As many reviewers have noted here correctly, this artist would not get a record contract but for the Shankar name!"
5,excellent music and an intellectual musician,"I totally agree with the review of Ravichandra Kulur , a musician who has worked with Anoushka. She is indeed a genius and child of Goddess saraswati. I am a musician and I see all the intricasies of her compositions. This not just another electronic album. This is new music. She is her father's daughter alright."
3,Not as Inspiring as the previous ones,"The first time I listened to Anoushka Shankar was when I bought the ""Live at Carnegie Hall"" CD. That music to me was very inspiring and moved me in a very delightful way. The next one I listened to was ""Anourag"" and that too left me in awe. But I couldn't find the purity and inspiration of her earlier works in ""Rise"".The items I like in ""Rise"" are ""Prayer in passing"" and ""Voice of the Moon"", but I found the rest to be very average, in a relative way.Art affects people in different ways, depending on ones receptivity and consciousness also, so you may feel differently about it. I hope she creates something in the future that moves me the way her earlier CDs did."
4,Yes - you can play this at work...,"Very nice for listening to at work - had no trouble at all playing on the office computer. Soothing, rythmic - a nice contrast to some of the other music I play while working (Dr. John, Moby, etc.). I especially like the addition of different types of musical instruments."
5,Fabulous music,I am a grade 7 student and our teacher brought this CD Rise to class and played it for us as she had attended a solo concert of Anoushka in New York 2 weeks ago. She said Anoushka was amazing and a youth icon.She told us that we should all go and see her in concert sometime. We loved the Cd and danced away to Red Sun. I went on Anoushka's website and she is so beautiful.
5,BRILLIANT!! BEST ALBUM OF 2005,"This is the most excitng world music/Indian CD to come out in ages. The arrangements are supurb and the sitar is tastful and well executed. No, Anoushka is no Ravi, but a first rate talent in her own rite.Not mainstream Indian music by any stretch, but this is exciting, mood enchancing music that will grab you from the first cut and hold you through till you hit replay.This is the best new album of 2005"
4,good in the car,saw her in concert with her father in Houston and that started the desire to find her music. this is a very enjoyable CD in the house or the car.
4,Seiko 5 good mechanical watch,"I got the watch for Christmas. I had a Seiko 5 maybe 20+ years ago, lost it in an airport. This watch keeps good time, gains about 5-6 seconds/day which is not bad for a mechanical watch. I found that if you shake it for about 2 minutes (as in winding it up) it will gain about 5 seconds. Three things about the watch I don't like: you can't hand-wind and it does not have a hack function, but all Seiko 5's are built that way. Then there's the bracelet. I replaced the metal bracelet with a more comfortable leather band.Overall I like the watch, and you can't beat the price."
5,The best book on selenium EVER!,"This book goes into great detail over this essential trace mineral called selenium. I've bought other books on selenium and this is by far the most detailed, yet it is still very easy to read. I couldn't put this book down once I got it!"
4,Boy does this guy know how to write a catchy tune,"And there are far too many dry, commercialized, pre-packaged formulas swimming around out there nowadays. I loved Extreme back in the day, and clearly Nuno was a prime contributer to their musical flair.There are quite a few stand out tracks on this one, the slower ballad type songs especially. His choice of chord changes really spice up his songs and he sings with passion and feeling. These songs 'go somewhere,' and don't just stagnate with a boring melody and locked into the same four chords over and over.Also check out his best of Nuno cd which I got last week. This guy knows how to write a memorable song. Wish there were more Nuno's in the world, but there aren't. However, isn't that what makes it such a treat when you finally find a gem like he?"
3,Average Movie,"This Italian made WWII movie is average at best. The major cast members are luminaries from the United States, France and England. The battle scenes are well-done with plenty of tanks and extras, but there is not much of a plot. The story, focusing on a group of friends from different nations who go separate ways during the war, is improbable and only dwelt one sporadically. Recommended only for WWII movie fans. The VHS from Media is of good quality."
3,Okay Movie,"In many ways, this movie seems to be a remake of the movie ""The Victors"". It sort of has the same theme, the futility of war. 2 of the actors are the same, George Peppard and George Hamilton. But ""From Hell to Victory"" just doesn't measure up to ""The Victors"". I just wish I could buy ""The Victors"" at a less than ridiculous price. ""From Hell to Victory"" is a pleasant story; it's a pleasant way the spend the time of its run."
4,must see for Umberto Lenzi fans!,"I checked this out because I really like Umberto Lenzi and George Peppard. I was not disappointed, this is easily my favorite of Lenzi's WWII films. The film is about the effects of WWII on a group of friends, basically. Plenty of action and drama to keep you entertained. And George Hamilton is actually really kick ass in this, I was surprised!The dvd ain't so hot, though. Its vhs quality but it is watchable and the sound quality is okay. Its worth picking up if you want to see a different side of Lenzi, are interested in Italian WWII films, or if you like George Peppard."
1,Small & smelly,"These ears look nothing like the picture. They are small and some of that length is made up of the knobby uncut base and not the ear. Again, the picture shows a cut ear without the base. Worse, they smell...badly. Don't think I can store them in the house and can't handle them without getting the smell in your hands. Seems like the smell is coming from the ear base. I've bought nice, clean, white large ears from another supplier and these are nothing like them."
4,"Large cows ears, dog loves them",I ordered the 100 pc cows ears as our dog loves them and pesters us until he gets one each evening. These were very large and we could cut them in half. I will order these again.
2,Cow Ears,"I've ordered cow ears several times and my dogs usually love them, but they are sniffing and turning their heads on the last order of cow ears. The ears are smaller than previous orders and they do NOT look like the photo discribing the cow ears. I ordered ""natural"" cow ears this go around from another company and we will see how this goes. Hopefully this new order won't be a waste of money like the last one."
3,Cow Ears,This order had smaller ears than my last order. Sometimes the ears are really large and other times they are really small.
3,just okay,The add led me to believe the cow ears were much larger than they actually were.The dogs really like them.
3,100 Cow Ears,"The ears were delivered fast. They are very small, not what I'm used to getting, but the price is OK for what you are getting. Some of the ears looked like they were from a calf, and were VERY thin."
5,Great Ears for a Great Price,"These ears were just what I needed to give as a gift. The sizes vary from HUGE, to decent size. No slivers or those puny ones (and I have gone through 300 now). The nice thing is that they arrive in a box, but are bagged in groups of 10 I think (they get opened and dumped so quickly I never looked at how many are in there). So if you only needed half, you can store the rest in their un-opened bags. I really like this seller and will continue purchasing these ears several times a year to give out in our gift bags."
3,Awesome Value; Revised,"The original review was for Rawhide Depot. They came 100 ears in a box, no plastic, no smell, and were ""flattened."" These from BestBullySticks were curled, as if just getting cut from the cow, were stinky, and packaged in plastic 25 ears per bag. The dogs don't seem to care. They are still the best value on Amazon, but I may look to other vendors in the future. I don't know how BestBullySticks inherited my review from Rawhide Depot.Original Review:This was an awesome value for these cow ears. They are very large and my dogs just love them. I used regular shipping and they arrived in about a week. I thank you, and my dogs, Dollee and Chee thank you.Added: I have made several purchases from Rawhide Depot, and their cow ears did vary quite a bit in size, shipment to shipment."
4,Attention Grabber From the very beggining!,"Atticus was one of my most favorite books I have ever read. It inthreades you into it at the very beggining. You couldnt put it down even if you wanted too. Atticus takes off from Colorado to retrieve his sons body from Resureccion. You begin to think of why he commited suicide, he seemed like such a happy boy. Then Ron Hansen throws the reader off again. Atticus suspects he was murdered! Through all these twists and turns in the book you find it hard to stop reading. The author doesnt stop there...A couple more twists and turns and the ending presents itself. Icouldnt of found a better book to read (other than Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings). It was a good book over all and I rate it four stars."
1,Low rent Cormac McCarthy,"Perhaps I'm missing something, as this book is well reviewed by many. To me this book is simply a variation of Cormac McCarthy themes, poorly written, almost pompous in a sense."
2,Atticus was poorly written with a weak plot and characters.,"The author was trying way too hard to please the book critics here. The plot was thin, the characters either too canned or too ethereal to be believed. I couln't ""feel"" them at all. I like to get lost in a book and I couldn't even get interested, even when I guessed the ending correctly half-way through. It was like icing on a store-bought cake...it looks great when you see it, but it tastes heavy and greasy. What a disappointment"
2,Love it or Hate it. I choose the latter,"This was my first time reading a book by Hansen, and frankly I was not impressed. The book is about a Colorado rancher who leaves for Mexico after the suicide of his son. There are so many different characters to keep track of, it is hard to keep it straight. There is also much information that just does not need to be there, for example references to the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The worst of it all just about half way through the whole story is retold from a different viewpoint, I was not exactly ecstatic about the change. On the other hand, there were a few instances of great descriptions, that is what gave this book the two stars. Overall you would not have wasted your couple of dollars or $0.74 if purchased used."
3,Atticus stuck in traffic,"The book Atticus by Ron Hansen is a great mystery with a creative climax that builds the plot. Atticus starts off slow and the introduction is rather slow paced as well. The beginning and the end of the story reminds me of sitting in traffic because the story doesn't seem to go anywhere and once the story starts picking up, the story stops suddenly. The main character Atticus went to Mexico in search of his son who died without reason. With twists and surprises, Atticus searches for the truth about Scott's death. The only reel interesting part of the story was the climax, everything else seemed seamless and slow without direction. For example, the resolution to the story that retold what actually happened through the eyes of a different character. By this point in the book, I lost interest and felt the book ended poorly. Atticus only entertained me for a few chapters, besides that I felt like I was driving in traffic."
2,Atticus,"I read this because of a recommendation by a person in my book ckub. I found the idea of the story interesting, but I think the author did not do a good job in connecting all the parts and characters. Nevertheless I finished the book. But I knew the outcome before the end. Predictable."
4,The twist and turn,"After forcing myself to read this novel by Ron hansen titled Atticus, i found it to quite the heart racing page turner, after the first few chapters. The novel begins off rather slow, giving the reader an overveiw of the characters as well as the location and some history of the family involved. As one moves forward into the novel and reads how Atticus goes to Mexico to bury Scott, he finds some situations rather odd, Renata being one. She seems a little distant emotionally. As well as Stuart. So atticus begins to suspect murder, but does not know where to begin his search. Once i had hit this area, i sought to read further to discover the culprit. Once the novel pushes the reader further into the plot, one will not know who to blame and for which part of the plot. This novel has many twists and turns around each chapter. I suggest this book, if it wasn't already forced on you to read by Jesuit"
4,Great story,"One of the reviewers called this novel a ""literary"" mystery. I think that is a perfect description of this book. Hansen weaves a tale full of emotion and compassion while at the same time crafting a superb ""who-dunnit"". This is only my first of Hansen's works but there will definitely be more."
4,"Mexico, a good place for a US mystery.","I wanted to become an expatriate with the others in Mexico but there were some questionable plot devices for adding characters. It was easy to get into the pattern that Atticus was following and I was anxious to see the next twist. The flashbacks brought enough meaning to the present action that the coincidences didn't seem forced but that they could have happened just that way, at least in Mexico"
3,Slow But Good,"To begin this book was very slow and very boring. It seemed obsessed with useless and unnesasary details. However, after the story began to move, which wasn't until late in the book, it was pretty good. Ifelt what saved this story form being just another murder mystery was the final twist. Without them the sory would most likly have a very bland feeling. If you like twist and turns and don't mind waiting for them this book is for you."
2,The book that went on and on and on...,"I started reading this novel with anticipation; however, I ended it with disappointment. The story of Atticus going to Mexico to pick up his dead son only to suspect murder intrigued me.However, when I was reading the novel it just seemed to go on forever. It didn't interest me until the middle of the novel where the reader can actually start to suspect murder. Just a couple of pages further my interest was immediately lost with the author's ""suprise solution"". The other half of the novel consisted of an extremely long and elaborate explanation to his solution.The end of the novel was abrupt and explained nothing, as if the author got tired of writing and just finished the novel right there. I did like the themes that the author chose, they were strong and hard-hitting. Perhaps this is a review of an ignorant teen-ager who has just finished his first mystery novel,but it is just a review."
4,Atticus-A story of discovery,"Atticus was a hartwarming story about a man's search for answers about his sons death. His son, who lives in mexico has committed suicide and his father goes down there to retrieve his body. When he gets down there though,he finds clues that lead to a suspicion that maybe his sons didn't commit suicide, and maybe there is much more about what happened to his son than meets the eye...Atticus is a very exciting novel that willl keep you rivited throught the story. It can be quite confusing at times, but it is worth working through to reach the extremely climactic ending. This book has alot of twists and turns in the plot and I would highly recommend reading this book to any fan of the mystery genre."
3,Atticus,"Ron Hansen's ""Atticus"" is an intriguing novel vividly describing a man's search for meaning in a murder mystery setting. Atticus Cody is sucessful Colorado rancher who has a troubled relationship with his son Scott. When Scott supposedly commits suicied in Resurreccion, Mexico Atticus leaves to bring his son's body home. Being an old fashioned man Atticus does not fit in to his son's rowdy town. He feels alone in a strange place. Instead of accepting his son's death he investigates it. He comes to the conclusion thathis son had been murdered. Hansen takes the reader on a wild ride as Atticus searches for his son's killer. Although Hansen's writing style is hard to follow at times, the mysterious story line keeps the reader hooked to the book. I recommend this book solely on its beautifully crafted story line, even though it is hard to follow at times."
3,Be Careful,"I really loved the songs which brought back many memories, but was disappointed that the original artists were not singing."
5,Its just plain Good!,"I love You, Willie!! Your ""Midnight Rider"" and ""Blue Skies"" were great gifts for my mother! If anyone likes you music willie than they have to but this CD. Love Ya Willy!"
4,"Great CD, But Not the Best","This is a great collection of Willie's best songs. However, it leaves off the classic ""Poncho & Lefty"" without adding anything essential in return. For my money, Columbia's ""Super Hits"" collection is the best Willie Nelson sampler on the market."
5,a Great Set,"I always have dug Willie Nelson.His Take of ""Georgia on My Mind"" is Great.""Always on My Mind"" is Great Here.His&Elvis's Version are my favorites of that song.I Also dig ""On The Road Again"".I Wish Willie's Version of ""StarDust"" was here?but Nevertheless a Strong Set."
3,It's okay.,"Not too bad of a collection. Most of his big hits are here, as the title implies. I just was hoping for some of his Waylon duets, but I guess I could probably get them on one of his other 40 collections of songs. Regardless, his catalog is excellent, and seeing as how I'm not the biggest Nelson fan, just a casual fan, this cd was pretty decent. If you aren't a hard-core fan, this cd might do it for you. With the deletion of a couple songs and the addition of a couple more, this cd would have been much better."
1,16 hits my a**,"RIP OFF. 5 hits, all familiar to Willy fans, and 11 absolutely awful songs that were never hits. Even ""My Heros Have Always Been Cowboys"" is awful. It is a different version than the one with Waylon Jennings, which was classic and tone perfect. This one has a lot of background violins and a chirpy chorus. The arrangement could have been stolen from the Osmonds or Lawrence Welk. Eco, whoever that is, is buying rights to rejects, songs it is hard to imagine were made by someone with Willy Nelson's talent, and falsely promoting them as hits. Don't be conned."
4,Great Willie,"This is all the songs I used to listen to of Willie's. Rebuilding my music collection honestly, by paying for the music..only right.There is at least one song recorded live ( I do not care for them) But the rest seemed to be his earlier rougher voiced Willie."
5,Excellent Book!,"This was an outstanding book. This book manages to cover thehistory of organized crime from the early days until the present time. All of the famous gangsters are covered in this book,fromAl Capone,Lucky Luciano,up to the present day Mafia dons. Youare given insight into some of the businesses the the Mafia wasentered into such as gambling and bootlegging. Also recieving good coverage was the evolution of the modern day Mafia throughthe takeover of Organized crime by Lucky Luciano,Meyer Lansky,andBugsy Seigel. The Mafia presence at the House UN-American activities hearings is also given good coverage. An excellent book on the subject of organized crime. You will not be dissapointed."
5,Book Nitty-Gritty,"Released in 1975, Playboy's Illustrated History of Organized Crime is a chunky brick of a book, 377 pp, 3 pounds. B&w; illustrations throughout with some color plates.Hardcover: cloth over hardback boards with a sewn binding. With dustjacket.

1,Dont take the trouble to get this cd. Overhyped Stuff...,"The jacket says its a brahmsian concerto, a fantastic work of the 20th century. Thats not true. Most great music becomes memorable in few stray hearings. I have listened to it 3 times , yet I cant say I comprehend where the music is heading. I coudnt bring to my mind a single hummable, musical phrase to endear the work to me. This CD will gather dust. Instead spend this money on a burger or something, money better spent. May be Maw's ""Odyssey"" will be better..lets see"
3,Best game I've ever watched,"I've played the previous games in this set and enjoyed them. However, this game is not a game you play, so much as a game you WATCH. If I ever have a bunch of time to waste again, I am going to total how much time is spent watching this movie, uh, I mean game, and how much you actually DO something. Waaaaay too much diaglogue.I agree with some other gamers that the controls are bad at best and hard to get use to. Fighting was something I came to dread, it was so awful to manipulate your character. I usually had to fight each bad guy at least twice before I survived the ridiculousness of it all.On the plus side, the visuals, music and voice-acting are really wonderful. The story line is OK and the few puzzles in the game are easy to a little-bit-harder-than-easy.A fun time waster, in all."
2,Game Controls ruin this gaming experience,"I was so excited to play this game. While I think the storyline is good and the graphics awesome, the awkwardness of the controls makes this game a chore. I can't count how many times my character has gotten killed because I couldn't smoothly navigate out of danger's way. This control clunkiness has kept me stuck in certain sections of the games for hours (if not days because I've had to ""walk away""). On two occasions already (I'm only half way through the game), it's taken me 10 plus minutes to get up a staircase. Ridiculous. Several times now, I've considered abandoning Dreamfall because of the frustration factor. Don't buy unless you have a gamebox or the equivalent or a joystick for PC."
3,"Good game, too short.","I got this game because i was a big fan of the first game ""The Longest Journey"" which is also by Funcom. its a great game. good graphics, well thought out main characters and an amazing story line. My only problems are that the game is too short, and the end leaves much to be desired. Many of the characters had almost no background at all, and some of the mysteries in the game just end unsolved which leads e to believe there will be a third game, but so far I haven't been able to find one. However, if one does become available, i will fight someone for a copy. plain and simple. solid game."
2,Waste of time !?!!,"I know this wont be a long and full review sorry, but I have to say something. This ending was the worst ive played in years !!no endings at all where givin to you just a bunch of questions.not one question was answered in this game and for that i give it a bad score.i felt it was a complete waste of my time.ok, its fine for tv where we can see the closing within a week but for a game that takes 4-6 yrs to make, this is completely ridicilous."
2,NOT the best adventure game......,"I'll keep this short....First off, I had to reinstall OLD drivers for my 512 meg video card to make this game work correctly. Half Life 2, HL2 Episode One, Oblivion and Painkiller all worked without a hitch.Second, the controls are the worst. As many others have mentioned, I got tired of bumping into walls and spinning in circles. And to have to HOLD DOWN the shift key in order to simply walk instead of run is crazy...Third, I wasn't as impressed with the graphics as others. Check out Half Life 2 and it's add-on Episode 1 or Painkiller and it's add-on for really nice graphics. The charactors looked like something out of games from 3 or 4 years ago...and I had the game video setting maxed out...Fourth....not much going on in gameplay...your course is set....no exploration allowed. Just aweful.I did think the voice overs were WAY better than Oblivion but not as good as HL2.Very dissapointed....especially since the first version was really well done...."
4,LIKED IT EXCEPT FOR.....,"the controls for pc suck!!!!! but otherwise, it's fun. If I remember right I didnt have so much trouble moving the character around on the first Journey game...the controls were much better...what happened?"
4,Great adventure game,"It was a very entertaining game, with a good story line and great dialog to back it up. The game environment is immersive and nice to look at, but the character modeling could use a little work."
3,Beware if intending to play on laptop without game controller!,"I purchased this game because I loved the original The Longest Journey. The story and graphics are great, but I hate the PC laptop interface using the keyboard and/or touch pad. Within the first few minutes, I almost stopped playing, the user control is awful! But the story is engrossing and I did eventually get used to the PC controls. Also, I do not like the fighting (the original did not have it) and I do not like the changing of characters. However, I am still playing because I like the story so much. I understand that a game controller makes the user interface much better - but who wants to lug that around with the laptop. Besides, I don't intend to play any more games requiring it."
5,3 Years after comleting this,"A few years later and i still think about this game during the day. I don't even know what it is about it, it's just a nice relaxing stress relieving game!"
5,Dreamfall is a must have,"This is by far the best adventure game I have seen in years. The characters are believable and the sound and graphics simply stunning. Zoe is ""real"" and the game gave me and my family many hours of enjoyment. It's nice to see a game like this. I haven't yet played The Longest Journey, but will definitely play it now."
2,Controls are very bad and ruin the experience,"I resend my original review. After completing the game, I can tell you it is a masterpiece of art. The puzzles are extremely easy but the artwork in the game is of the highest quality.The controls are bad if you do not have a game controller. If you have a game controller then the controls are easy as with most games.It's great and I now give it 5 stars."
3,A Huge Disappointment..,"( - )- most linear gameplay that I have ever seen in a game- uninteractive world- tons of unnecessary dialoque accompanied with dull looking characters- terrible face animations- 5/minute loading screens- idiotic puzzles- nasty control system and outrageous camera angles- most of the time average graphics for todays standarts (and below average indoors)- Cheesy mtv style pop songs- ex boyfriend addicted Zoe, bad looking April- waiting for this game for years( + )- Zoe's introduction scene and it's music- Casablanca, Streets of Arcadia- Menu theme and soundtrack (not the pop songs)- voice acting- other sounds"
3,Very difficult navigation & interface.,"The mouse drags s-l-o-w-l-y. I am still stuck in the house because when I pick up her cell phone, it won't let me read the messages. I have a brand new computer with Windows XP and can run almost any other game on it. I gave up trying to play it until I can find a patch. Also, I hate having to ""run up"" on things in order to get a huge box to show up around something to see if I can interface with it. It is slow, jumpy, and awkward. What a shame, because I think if I could get it to work better, I would really like it.I feel like someone gave me a delicious piece of pecan pie ala mode but handed me an enormous pitch fork with a 6' handle to eat it with.I'll try to play it some other time."
5,A true Adventure game,"Okay, I love it. It has great graphics, an imaginative story, and fun but not impossible puzzles. It is like reading a novel (in that I was totally immersed in the world) but with something extra. I think this is a great follow-up to Longest Journey and offers a little more interesting than just a shooter."
1,Game? This was a GAME?,"This was one of the MOST disappointing letdowns I've had about a game in a LONG time. There was practically no game to play; it was really just a series of whichever character walking from one conversation to the next. I do NOT consider a puzzle to be finding a single object for 5 different people who need the SAME thing simply to give it to one another. I ALSO do not consider a puzzle running into an obstacle and overcoming it simply by touching a few matching symbols.I hear people talk of the wondrous graphics of this game. All I seemed to notice were boxy, repetetive 3-D renderings that were fairly dull.The original game on which this farce was based blows it out of the water. DON'T waste your money or time on this piece of garbage."
1,Check your video card before buying.,"There are many video cards this game does not support and only a few it will work with. This game will *not* run on a computer with a non-supported video card. It would be a good idea to check your system against the game's requirements before purchasing. I own the game, but cannot use it on any of my 3 computers."
2,Basically - as a game it sucks - great movie but not a game!,"Graphics are good, too much dialogue for a game. The fighting is slow and sloppy, moves are highly circumscribed and lack creativity. There is little in the game to challenge an experienced game player. You know where to go and what to do because that is all you can do - no exploration of the worlds is available, no side quests to be had, no weapons changes for any of the three characters you become. I found the entire game to be fairly one dimensional. The story was entertaining, but I never became a part of the story. The game was simplistic to play - it took me less than 24 hours to reach the end of this game (as a comparison - the original shadow-man took me over three months of play time. ) - and the ending was the final and ultimate disappointment. I do not rate this game very highly as a game for those who enjoy challenging and engrossing gameplay."
2,Moving/mobility character is AWFUL,I really have enjoyed the storyline BUT simply moving the character around and interacting with and within environment is difficult at best on this PC game. It might be easier to play if played in a different format- Xbox or PS2 but NOT PC version. I got sooooo frustrated with not being able to easily move the character that I had to stop playing the game. I guess I am used to the fluidity of motion that comes with playing other PC adventure games such as Nancy Drew.
2,SPOOKYMYSTERY,"WELL, AFTER WAITING FOR SUCH A LONG TIME FOR A SEQUEL. THIS IS NOT THE GENIUS THE FIRST ONE WAS. TO MUCH RUNNING AWAY, FIGHTING AND PC PLAY WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. SORRY, NOT MY CHOICE FOR A GOOD SEQUEL."
3,It's Beautiful (Yawn),"The Manuf says how there are so many ways to do something. But in reality there is no different result. Whatever you do, the game plods on, easily, linearly, and with little cohesion. It had some adult language, but why bother? A sign for the ""rooster and cat"" (I paraphrase) next to a sign for ""The Salty Seaman"" is not really daring. It's just kind of out of place and crude in the beautiful background. Why not take out that junk and make it marketable to 5-10 years old? (which is about the challenge level offered.) My advice, get HL2 or HL2E1 instead. Don't reward this half-hearted effort by buying it. There are too many other worthy games out there."
2,Dreamfall: The longest disappointment,"I was really looking forward to the sequal to the Longest Journey. Although in Longest Journey, there were many long long conversations, the storyline was enjoyable and movement uncomplicated. Unfortunately, Dreamfall is disappointing. First of all the movement through the game is difficult using the computer controls. It is easy to be trapped in a situation because of this movement. Also, there is combat. I was looking for another game which utilized strategy and puzzle solving. Unfortunately, there are silly combat scenes which distract from the game playing and are frustrating to a player like myself who is not interested in an arcade type game.The positive aspect of the game is the graphics which are superb.Apparently, from the other reviews I have read, they have left the story hanging at the end in order for a sequel to be made. I'm not sure I would be interested due to the negatives I refer to earlier."
2,A 20-hour movie,"This is not really an interactive game. It is a 20 hour movie, with some trivial occasional user input in between long scenes.Having said that, the plot and the characters were interesting. The ending, however, was disgraceful, with pretty much every major plot point left unresolved. It is like watching a long movie, and then, 20 minutes before the end, the screen goes blank.Is this a shameless attempt to sell the sequel? Someone's idea of a joke? Developer ran out of money? Or maybe someone just likes to mess with people's heads.Your guess is as good as mine."
2,Sequel,I wanted a sequel to The Longest Journey. I got a sequel to Lara Croft.I wanted to feel a sense of achievement solving puzzles and making progress. Instead I feel success when I manage to walk through a door without hitting the sides and finishing up with a view of a plain boring wall.How wise of Funcom to NOT issue a demo!
1,"If you wanted to make a movie, you should have just made a movie...","I've been playing adventure games for years and this was by far one of the worst I have ever encountered. Dreamfall played out more like a movie, with at least half of its game time being devoted to extensive movie and dialogue sequences. Granted, the story was great, but if the developers wanted to make a film, that's what they should have done... this game offers very few puzzles of the kind you would expect of a top-rated adventure game, and any choice leads directly to a singular conclusion. The end of Dreamfall would be great for a movie, but, for a game in which you have invested 10-20 hours, it is very disappointing. I definitely do not recommend Dreamfall to classic adventure gamers... or anyone, really."
2,Not a real adventure game,"I really like Adventure games. But this is not really it. Those of you who remember the old interactive movie games, will know how Dreamfall plays. It has a really good story to it, though, and that is its most redeeming quality. Very sub par game, and not a proper sequel to The Longest Journey, and I marvel at the awards it got last year. Worth 20 bucks or so...but not much more. Few puzzles, little combat, or gameplay. Mostly you spend the ENTIRE game going from 1 person to another and talking...and talking...and talking. Occasional item crafting, but again, you spend the game going from point to point and talking.If you really want to see the Longest Journey's story progress, you can get it. But there are better adventure titles out there for you."
2,Have you watched Dreamfall?,"This is less like a game and more like a movie that you have to click around a few times on to get the next scene. There were hardly any puzzles and the cut scenes were too long. I LOVED the first Longest Journey and this one is a great disappointment. Add in political preachiness and you get a game that generally falls flat. The graphics are beautiful, though!"
3,Dreamfall MN review,I was entertained by the game but it was not as interactive as I thought it would be.
3,Not for the uncoordinated,"Okay, everybody's talked about the poor interface. Buy a gamepad. But do not buy this game if you aren't very coordinated. There are several sequences I had to play over and over (even with a gamepad) because I'm not the most coordinated guy. Very frustrating."
1,A frustrating journey of absolutely random nonsense,"Definitely get this game if you are the type who enjoys random strange plot twists that have no bearing on actually accomplishing anything in the game. Stupid, stupid, fight system, and only 4 or 5 fights! Also, no questions raised by the plot are EVER RESOLVED!!!!!!! The story is compelling in it's strange plot twists, but overall it completely fails to deliver any sort of satisfaction through resolution or connection of said plot twists. The story seems promising, like ""gosh this is confusing, but when it all gets tied together in the end it will be super awesome!"" but, then the implied promise of the main character's actions actually leading anywhere dissolves into meaningless new questions imposed at the end. This game is unforgivable."
1,A Five Star Gaming Experience,"Yes!! I think this is the best game ever created and the most original story ever been told,it offers the most satisfying gameplay experience it features the most user friendly control system ever invented and Ragnar Tornsomething is the god of the gaming endustry.. we love you funcom (P.S. don't forget to buy the expension. only 39.99 !!)"
1,Doesn't work on my computer,The game doesn't support my graphics card (intel extreme graphics).The game lists this limitation but the web site doesn't.
1,Cornball: The Longest Borefest,"THRILL: to a story almost good enough to appear in a seventh-grade science fiction fanzine! HEAR: enlessly repetitive dialog read by a wide selection of Irish actors! SOLVE: the puzzle of why you just traveled between worlds, escaped from prison, ran around and around town, and then went back home, without changing one single aspect of the game! WIN: by doing something really, really horrible!OR: devote 20 hours of your life to CSPAN coverage of Senate debate on an omnibus appropriations bill. It'll be less tedious and you may learn something useful."
1,A First Class Fiasco,Holie Cowiee !!! here is the good 5 star... You run around like a mad cow all the time and then.. Blahblahblahblahblah.. Blah..lahblah..!! Oh my holy fork.. hitting the space button has never been this boring before
1,What kind of strange stupid accent is that???,I was just about to buy this game. Overall the reviews have been pretty good but they I watched a game review video on google video and.. my God! The main actor speaks some kind of disgusting primitive British english. I normally don't mind normal British but she sounds like some kind of primitive street person. What is that all about?There is no way that I will every play that game and I highly recommend that you watch an actual game video before you buy it.Otherwise it looks very nice but the gameplay seems to be very minimal.
5,Great Shovel,"I am very hard on shovels because i live on a corner and don't want to be shoveling all day so this shovel did me good for the short time i used it this winter. Looking forward (well not really) to using it next winter. Only bad part was that the handle could be a little tighter in the shovel, otherwise a great product."
5,The best writer you aren't reading,"In 30 years, Howard Waldrop will have the same authority as a speculative fiction writer that Philip K. Dick has now.His stories are so insanely off the wall that no one else could have possibly even thought them up and so brilliant that only a master could have pulled them off. He manages to take familiar tropes and items that we know and put them in an entirely new context without the slightest hint of pastiche.The title story is War of the Worlds set in Texas."
5,Big Hit with the Guitar Lovers,"Nice, colorful, pretty accurate versions of the guitars - was very well received as a gift for a guitar loving daughter."
2,So-So Sequel,"Without the witty repartee of Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen, the sequel falls flat. Some cool effects, but you can say that about a lot of stuff."
3,It is okay,"What can you say...it is a remake of a classic horror movie. I think the evil spirit at the end was really lame. Oh well! trouble of being a horror fan, can never find an awesome movie to watch."
1,bad experience with seller,"I ordered this ring, looked unique. When I received it, I did not care for it. It sat up very high, really big. I sent it back and asked Hope Chest Jewelry to credit my visa, they did not. So I called them, the first thing they asked me was if I insured the ring when I sent it back, I did not, should have. They said ring was damaged in shipping, e-mailed me pictures of torn package and the ring, which we could see no damage, and the ring I sent back had tags on it, this ring did not. Asked them to either send me my ring back or money. Neither. Beware of this seller!"
4,"An Interesting Translation, But Not To Learn On.","Since my father was a devout Anglo Catholic, the ""King James"" was the translation I first read. In my opinion this translation is best read after one has an understanding of the scriptures. Remember, neither Christ nor the Apostles spoke Elizabethan. In my opinion, one should learn the Scriptures on something like the Revised Standard. (One that is plain and easy to read.) After one has an understanding of the scriptures, then this version is a beautiful study."
4,Great Value,"For anyone seeking a good cross-section of Mountain's best work at a bargain price, this disc is a fine choice. Vastly superior to the hackneyed ""Extended Versions"" (a hodgepodge of sloppy and very poorly edited live performances), this one delivers a nice sampler of Mountain's best studio work. The track selection is quite good, including ""Blood of the Sun"", from Leslie West's ""Mountain"" solo album (produced by Felix Pappalardi), which led to the formation of the band, as well as highlights from the band's heyday. This disc is a good pick for anyone, showing the band at their best, and delivering good music at an exceptional price. Highly recommended."
5,kill your television so that all you do is listen to this cd,"ok so you're thinking about buying a new album, and im here to tell you to buy this one! From the first song to the last this cd is packed with catchy lyrics and a great sound which includes a keyboard. my favorite song is probably Star Searching, but other great ones include Stuck on You and Dedication. That's all I have to say about that, this album is one of the best of the year, i strongly recomend it, and i also strongly recomend seeing these guys live cuz they're amazing! Hope you like it as much as i do!"
2,Could have been so much more,"Dissappointing is all I can say. Their influences are so right on and so worn on their sleeves that they COULD have made a real statement. A shameless nod to the Cars and to 80's synth pop plus a modern sensibility. Instead they hint at it with so much of a self-conciously ""home-made"" sound that it loses me by the third song. They obviously went with a producer by name value instead of with someone who realy undertood them and the result is, sad to say, generic.I still think they are a special band under all this; but this is not that special record they could have made. Recommended for only the faithful. If you saw them live and loved them, this will NOT take it to any new levels for you. And that's too bad."
2,Sky dance doll,My daughter was very excited to get this toy after the commercials were playing constantly on t.v. It was very hard for her to get the doll to fly more than a foot or so high. The cord also sticks and it is definately a hazard if you ar not careful as it hurts to get hit in the head with it.
3,Masonic Flag,"The product wasn't exactly as I hoped, but wasn't misrepresented. It cost a dollar and at that price it was quite a value. The shipping was more than the item, which wasn't a plus, but no fault of the sellers. The members I showed it to were impressed by it for the price and I will probably purchase more.The item can quickly, like 2 days and that also was a plus.Overall I was very happy with the transaction"
2,A Shoddy Sampler,"This album is missing way too many great Bangles songs. Get the individual albums instead. To really have the best Bangles material, get:1. Getting Out Of Hand/Call On Me -- their first single on Downkiddie Records. If you can still find it.2. The Bangles EP, on Faulty Records. Raw, rockin', less polished than their subsequent stuff, but better off for it. Also hard to find, but well worth the search.3. All Over The Place -- their first LP. This is a greatest-hits collection all by itself.4. Different Light -- a great, polished album, with many of their biggest hits.You can safely forget their last album, ""Everything."" That one was lousy compared to the above offerings. You'll spend a bit more to get these selections, but it will be worth it compared to buying this entirely non-definitive ""hits"" collection."
2,Not I was hoping for,"Don't expect these to be magical.I am pretty easy on tools, but these aren't that tough.On one stuck bolt, the first one I used broke without even giving up a fight. The 2nd one grabbed well, bu then it bent like a piece of licorice.I would recommend these for very light-duty work.Fortunately Amazon was amazing in the return process."
4,Handy Items,"These inexpensive bits will be useful whenever I get another bolt stuck. However, I have not used them yet so I do not know the exact strength or how long they last. It was a good price for the common size extractors."
3,disappointing,"Very verbose, little power, read Patey if you are truly interested in Waugh. It is a pity someone of such little breeding has addressed Waugh at all."
1,Total disappointment.,"This DVD did not arrive very quickly.When I put it into my DVD player I was faced with a warning:""Playback prohibited by area limitations"" on the screen.I now need to find out what I can do about the problem: the itemsold to me is totally unfit for purpose."
5,Nostalgic Christmas Songs!,"Don't buy this for the Snoopy's Christmas song. Buy it for great kids' Christmas music like ""Christmas Mountain."" These ar enot your run-of-the-mill boring Christmas songs. They are inventive Christmas ditties that are fun and yet sweet. As a kid, my family practically wore out the Caroleers' LPs with these Christmas numbers on it. This CD says the singers are ""The Peter Pan Singers"" but it sounds just like the Caroleers' versions that I recall. The quality of the recording is great! This is a super album for the young and young at heart. I only wish they recorded more of the original Caroleers' songs like ""The Christmas Tree That Ran Away"" and ""There's A Hole In My Christmas Stocking."""
5,Great way to trip down memory lane!,"If you ever wanted to hear some of those old records you might have had as a kid in the 60's, this cd should do the trick. Even if you had those old records, chances are they're full of pops and scratches from the abuse they took at the hands of a typical 6 year old. This is great way to hear some of those old songs."
4,Weird and Wonderful,"I really like these a lot. The author/photographer is great at finding cute scenes for Blythe to hang out in, and her home-made outfits are cool, hip, and adorable. Depending on where my friends and family members live, I'll send them postcards based on the opposite time of year: the beach for my sister living out cold winters, snowy days for friends living in hot, muggy climes, etc. They're tons of fun, highly original and all of the cards in the pack are different.My only suggestion (total pie-in-the-sky ridiculousness, considering the company doesn't make new Blythe dolls) is for someone to make Blythe-style dolls of different interests/nationalities and have them hang out in the photos, which I think would be fun."
4,Helpful Book,"This book is really helpful and interesting to read. But I can't really believe that these other people are claiming that by using this book, they were speaking French in 2 days. This book has a very good explanation of pronunciation in French -- which I have never seen anywhere else before. It made the seemingly random omissions of letters in French make sense to me. However, even though my daughter attends a French school and I have been studying this book, I would say that I am really far from being able to come close to having a conversation in French. I think that it would be much more helpful if this book came with a CD or cassette. I am fluent in Spanish, Russian and English, so I think that I am fairly good at picking up languages; however, I learned the other languages in the University setting. This is the first time I have tried to learn a language without a teacher or a class, and even with this well-written book, it is definitely a much less effective method for me."
5,This book is absolutely fantastic,"I got this book on Wednesday (today is Friday) andalready I can read and speak French ratherproficiently. Gail Stein makes things very clear.I do not remember being confused while reading this book.The pronunciation guide makes even the toughestwords simple.Not only is ""Complete Idiot's Guide to French""easy to use, but it teaches the language witha bit of humor, unlike a standard textbook.Ce livre est très bon, mes amis"
5,USRobotics USR9630,"My USRobotics Skype equipped, cordless phone does everything I expected it to do. It is great to be able to walk around and do other things while I am using the phone, as opposed to being tethered to my computer while I talk. I have 4 other cordless phones in use on the same phone line and the sound quality is great, whether I am talking through Skype or through my phone company. I'm not a geek, but I found the entire installation process to be quite simple."
1,not working,"I have constipation for two weeks and the doctor prescribed fibercon and citrucel to me. I bought fibercon in Walmart for 14.5 dollars. However, I didn't see any effect after taking for three days.To test its' quality, I put a capsule in a glass of water overnight to see what it would do. I expected to see a glass full of fluffy bulk, but the next day there sat the caplet, looking exactly the same as it did when I put it in the water. I poked at it and it fell apart, and looked like a tiny pile of kapok, then I put hot water in it, it does not change very much!I am very regretful to buy this product!"
4,"Florida, My Eden","Great book for the southern parts of Florida. It was hightly recommended by our Plant Nursery. Fairly good pictures but great discriptions of plants, trees, shurbs etc."
3,"Florida,My Eden","Product as described. Problem free transaction.Couldn't find some plants that I wanted to look up, but overall the book will be helpful."
3,"Good guide, but incomplete botany","This is a good book to start with if you've just moved to Florida and need to understand the landscape. It's well illustrated and laid out logically, but you'll find yourself looking for plants and trees you've seen in Florida that just are not in this book."
3,Hamish Macbeth DVD,"While the DVD's are very enjoyable, they are disappointing to someone who has enjoyed the novels. Outside of the title, they have very little to do with M.C. Beatons books, so don't look for the residents of Lochdubh or even Hamishs girlfriends. Cute is about all I can say, a pleasant watch"
1,Oh dear what happened?,We have all three Hamish Macbeth series. The first two series are a delight and we eagerly awaited the availability of the third. Oh dear what a disappointment! While the scenery is still there and beautiful and the characters are the same the scripts are poor. It seems that the writers have had to repeat themes (the singing and hockey competitions between the rival villages) and descend into parapsychology to finish the series off (which it literally did). The whole thing could have been done so much better. I'm not surprised this was the final series nowhere near the same high class as the first two. What on earth happened?[Edit]I guess the positive reviews for this are based on cultural differences. The third series I've viewed again and I still think it's poor compared to the first two.
1,Quality Control?,"Ordered this one twice now, and both times it arrived but would not play in any of my three DVD players in the house. ""Formatting Error"" came up in every instance. The DVD is advertised as created on demand, which leads me to believe that Pipin himself is burning this disc in his living room. Amazon, what gives? I live in California, and this DVD should have no problem being played. Amazon quickly replaced the first one, and I'm reluctant to try a third time when returning this 2nd one. Booo!"
5,Another Great Resource!,"Having previewed a pre-press copy of Judith's latest book, The Visible Librarian, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to solo and team librarians, alike! Whether you are new to the profession or an experienced information professional, you'll find The Visible Librarian to be a wonderful resource in this time of career and economic uncertainty!"
4,Visible Librarian: Asserting Your Value with Marketing and Advocacy,A nice read for librarians. This is a wake up call to all librarians to stand up and defend their rightful position in whatever environment in these changing times. Delivery by amazon was prompt.
2,soup ladle,"Seemed nice when I got it, but after a few months it was dropped on the floor and the ladle snapped right off the handle. It was clear they were cheaply attached with glue, so buy this for looks if you want, but be careful because it's not sturdy."
1,pseudoscience rules again!,"And here I thought only Lindzen and Singer could write with such deliberate obfuscation in mind. Hooray for the status quo, let's do nothing until it is too late."
3,Not sure why,"but my unit adds a lot of hum, even when grounded. I read the reviews on this before purchasing, which said it didn't add hum. Not the case with the one I received."
4,Pre-amp for turntable - amplifier connection,"This is necessary to connect my older analog turntable to my newer Pioneer tuner-amplier. It seems to work very well, but is another piece of equipmet. Allows me to listen to some good music on my old LPs."
4,Worked as stated,"I was looking for something that would get my 30 year old turn table to work with my receiver. I saw this item and after reading the reviews decided to order it.When I received the item, I plugged it in as directed, including attaching the ground from my turntable, and it worked like a charm. I'm now able to enjoy my record collection that has been gathering dust!The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because of the toggle switch on the power cord. Seems to me there would have been a better way to turn this on and off."
3,Good Preamp Starter,"For the money, this is a decent preamp. Easy to set up, easy to use, and it'll make your record player audible. For me, however, it ended up not being at the quality that I had wanted. There was a small, constant hum and became more noticeable the higher the volume setting. I tried to let it warm up for two or three weeks and the problem still persisted. The reason I gave this three stars though is due to the fact that the company was really cool and quick about returning it. Was given a full and timely refund and they even wanted to try to work something out when I first contacted them about my problem with it. Even if the preamp isn't great, I would definitely do business with phonopreamps.com again based off of their customer service. In short, I got what I paid for but wasn't up to my standards. Would recommend this to someone who wants a quick startup for a good price, wouldn't recommend it for those who are looking for a higher end audio experience."
3,not grounded?,"I bought this for my son so he could connect his turntable to his stereo, and so I could have my stereo receiver back. He says it needs a ground wire which it did not come with, now we have to start looking for one. Kind of frustrating."
2,Works well,This is the third phono preamp I bought. The first two were DOA and returned. I got this unit because it seemed a bit nicer. It works well. No hum.
5,A new favorite.,It is difficult to describe this book. It starts out as a thriller and then gradually transforms into a fantasy.
3,Not for everyone,"The novel involves the abduction and abandonment of Robin Kerr, a seven-year-old girl, to the wilds of a mountain top in the Ozarks. With Robin are a menagerie of animals and a spirit presence.I appreciated Donald Harington's writing. Several chapters are written in the point of view of a dog, something few authors could really pull off. His abandonment of reality really worked in the novel's favor. The characters are sympathetic and likeable, and I really wanted to see what happened to them.However, Harington overestimated the cognitive and physical abilities of a girl Robin's age, and the story of her sexual growth wasn't realistic, either. There is a theme of pedophilia throughout which, while never grossly inappopriate, made me question the author's own sexual interests. For that, I gave the novel 3 stars instead of 4, and though I enjoyed Harinton's obvious talent, I don't think I could really recommend the novel to many people."
4,One of his most difficult novels,"This is a brilliant novel from Donald Harington, but it is difficult to read. The subject matter is hard to connect with, and even his usual humorous storytelling seems distant to you as a reader. I think it's just the shock of what's happening. Over time, I've come to think the novel is very well-written and I would recommend it as a great literary novel. But the child-character and the details of her story are hard to digest. I love Donald Harington, and I will probably re-read this novel down the road, but it isn't for everyone. After everything our main character goes through, you are utterly devastated. And the ""triumph"" she has at the end is quiet and sad. Appropriate for the subject matter, beautifully written as always, but difficult to read."
4,Surprising,"I thoroughly enjoyed the shifting perspectives. You begin to overlook all of the horrible situations, and simply enjoy Harington`s careful and creative storytelling. This is one of the few original books I've read. Ever."
4,Me Likes,"I'll be honest: I never heard of Count The Stars until March of this year. How did I find out about them? Someone asked one of my co-workers about the stars he has tattood on his hand. When he explained that it because he sang for a group called Count the Stars, I figured, 'what the hell' and took a listen. And I'm glad I did! Chris has a good voice; the music is catchy and the lyrics are a) believable and b) unique (despite what other reviewers will say) in a time when ""radio-friendly"" (a term Chris used) bands all sound like they came from the same cookie-cutter."
3,"Good Songs, Weak Album","A poppy approach to punk (sort of like Sugarcult, Mest or New Found Glory). Individually the songs are awesome, which is what drew me to the album. The problem that comes is when you listen to the album straight through, all the songs have similar sounds to them. If you listen to songs randomly in a mix or shuffle manner instead of full albums then you will love this album. If you listen to albums all the way through, then it might take you awhile to really adapt to this album."
3,Disappointing,"I went out and bought this only having heard one of the songs (Brand New Skin) and thought since I liked that song, hey, they might be an okay band.I was wrong. This album lacks originality. I might as well have shelled out 2 more bucks for a Good Charlotte CD and I might have gotten a better deal (not to bash Good Charlotte ;).For a relatively new band, it was all right, but I'm not going to be waiting around for them to get better."
3,"Count these stars, wheres the other 2?","Well I am not going to bash this group. Because I do in fact find the cd quite catchy. But that also is where the problem lies. There is very little originality or thought put into these songs. Given there are some stand out tracks that include ""My best mistake"" and ""Saving Myself"". But those tracks do not save it from the mediocre 3 star rating I feel forced to give this album. Don't get me wrong, if you are a fan of pop/punk in vien of ""Green Day"" or ""The starting line"" then this album was made for you. If your looking for something new or fresh, you may want to just borrow it from your friend or download a track before purchasing."
3,It's okay.,"This is emo-punk, plain and simple. Not every song sounds the same, but some do. For as mega-young as the band members are, they do a pretty good job. They remind me of a young Blink 182, they could be on the verge of something big. Which I'm sure Victory is hoping for.Standout tracks are: ""Taking It All back"" and ""Understanding."" All and all this is one of those cd's you can play on a hot summer day just hanging out with your friends."
1,Stop now...,"Why does the lead singer sound like an Englishman? Each song sounds generally the same, and we have heard it all before."
1,displeased,do NOT buy this item to use in the microwave!!! the lid rim for the 1 1/2 qt casserole that I got at the same time splintered and left shards ranging from 1/4 inch to two inches of length in the food (I have not even had it a month yet); I was replacing old lids which lasted MUCH longer -- the original product carton specifies a 2 year warranty on the lids
3,Mismatched Sets...,"This review is more about how Amazon fulfilled the order rather than the product itself necessarily. I ordered 2 sets in the same order, so 4 sticks. When the order arrived one set was full height (3cm tall) DIMMs marked ""Assembled in Taiwan"" and the other set was half height (1.75cm tall) DIMMs marked ""Assembled in China"". The packages were marked with the same model number and specs. I just hope the actual specs are the same. I will of course install the matched sets in matching slots on the motherboard. I'll edit this review if I notice any stability issues related to these DIMMs.So if you are ordering just 1 set this isn't an issue, but if you are ordering 2 and a little a-retentive like myself you may be in for a surprise. It seems the people at Amazon that pull the items for orders don't use any common sense."
5,"It worked, need I say more!!!",Easy to install and it works. All from a brand you can trust at an affordable price!!!
4,Great Lens,"Love the lens, takes clear shots without the uv filter. The uv filter will cause image to badly blur out. As long as your not using this for sports images the focus speed is very good and the length of the zoom is excellent. Works very well with my rebel. the price is great for the lens and extras. The only reason it gets four stars not five is the uv filter. I would recommned this to anyone looking for a good starter zoom lens. Priced in stores and this is by far the best deal available. Thanks to Amazon."
5,BLENDING,THE SONGS HAVE A BLENDING OF NEW AND NOSTAGALIA AND ALSO A HINT OF GOSPEL. THE OLD HELLO AND THE NEW MIX OF HELLO TAKES YOU BACK AND BRINGS YOU UP. THE SONG ARIELLE HAS THAT HINT OF GOSPEL AND HAS A VERY IMPORTANT TO BOOT.THE CD SENDS YOU ON AN EMOSONAL ROLLER COASTER.
3,OK for more advanced programmers,I would not recommend this book for an inexperienced programmer. Topics can be complicated and examples are not always clear. Good book for some of the more esoteric aspects.
4,A lot of valuable info,"With a more reality-like setup example that uses several dll:s, perhaps on a machine with a policy that prohibits new code to run this would have been a perfect book!"
4,A welcome addition to our leather history,"Many how-to books have been written in the last decade, but no autobiographies that I know of. The author perceives his leather journey as spiritual, and shares that journey with the reader. The style includes flashback vignettes - simultaneously relevant and sexy -- that work uncommonly well. The domination and submission elements in the flashbacks were delicious without being lurid."
