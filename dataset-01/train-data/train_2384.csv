2,BORING!!!!!!!,"You can't judge a book by its cover and you can't judge a computer game by its box. Granted the game looks cool, but its sooo confusing! The instruction booklet is like 2 pages and just gives credits for who made the game- who would want to take credit for this awful game? The game is way to boring and takes a Harvard graduate to understand. If you want a real game get Age of Empires or Empire Earth."
1,Rise of nothing!,"Rise of the nations does not suck nor it is a superhit.Starting's ok but then,BORING.It's just one of those stragety games which have gone bum after a few days.The controller is pretty sluggish.The countries are almost the same.There is not even one part in the game where 'oh!It's so exiting' comes to your mind.Warcraft is much better.Beleive me"
5,This game is going to blow the rest away!,I am already blown away by this game and I have not even played it yet. The screen shots speak for themselves. This looks like it's going to be the strategy game of the year.
2,Needs non-combat,"My friend and I have played this game. We say it is great as far as the genre goes. However we are now both bored, and conclude that it places too much emphasis on aggressive game play. If you get into that kind of play all well and good. But having played Star Craft etc., we are now looking for something that is closer to the reality we know. The history of the Nation State runs together with non-nation state forms of organization: The gaming community, and software-producing geeks are examples. We are looking for a simulation game that can show us how both Nation State and Non-Nation State organizations network and support and control each other. Why? Because it would help us understand how things really work rather than the simple fight, bribe, buy and dominate modes of simulation games. Fun, but the genre still needs development."
3,It may be a great online expeirence but SP doesn't appeal!,"So Rise of Nations, a real time strategy game which in my opinion is more of a militaristic game than most. One of the main problems about Rise of Nations is its length. It took me 3 days playing it to beat the game and I have no appeal to replay this one. Ive heard that the multiplayer aspect to the game is great but when I review I like to judge the SP more than MP. To get away from my rant of the length, I have to say that I found RON's interface quite easy to use. The graphics were very well done and pleased my eyes.To some up my review, while I was playing the game I loved it but when the expeirence ended, my joy ended!"
2,Unfun,"I find RON so similar to Microsoft's Age of Kings series game mechanics. If you enjoy Microsoft's approach to RTS then I would recommend you buying RON.On the other hand, If your tastes are more inclined to Civilization then don't buy RON or you'll find it boring. I've honestly tried playing this game five times and I just cannot bare it. I eventually go back to civIII because I find it much more intelligent and deeper.In RTS it's not so much about the latest graphics, it's the playability and the challenge that counts. I find the graphics of RON better than those of Civ but it's just not enough I'm afraid.Drakan"
5,I AM A VETERAN RISE OF NATIONS ONLINE PLAYER!,I have to say the first time i recieved rise of nations i did not get the concept of making an empire with armies and the collection of resources through historical significant features.I have played online for along time and if u are thinking of getting this game you should consider online play as the best. i always play in any of my online games and they are fun. If u read my review and get the game and go online and u see Nemesis Immortal or ISC_Will_02 say hello and tell him that you read this review.
5,Best Strategy Game In a Looooong Time,"I play just about every RTS game that comes out, and this is the best one since the now-dated Age series. Game runs impressivly well on my older system. The background of the designers of Alpha Centuari and Civ II is clearly present."
5,Great,"first i ordered this, it came with no problem in 2 DAYS! then i popped it in and it was like heaven of all RTS and strategy games. everything about this game is good.i have CeasarIII and age of empires, i have also played empire earth and all 3 of them combined would not even compare to RoN! GET THIS GAME NOW IF YOU ARE READY FOR A REAL STRATEGY GAME!!THIS GAME IS THE BEST"
4,Great (for a limited time),"I've played this game 2 days and its already gotten tiresome...Once u become familiar with all the features it tends to get boring, especially with no missions/campaigns or different gameplay options besides the a bunch of scenarios and the usual ""survival of the fittest"". The graphics and features are however great, and the national identities are quite convincing."
2,clumsy game,"One second, there is too much to do. The next, you are waiting around to collect a resource to research or build something. Citizens needing to be told to go to work when there are open slots at your mines or woodcutting area is tedious and not fun. Having to research at seven different buildings instead on a single area is a poor idea. The AI does not need to search to find just the right building (which all look very similar) to study something, so why should the player?At the easiest, slowest setting, the player should be able to learn and crush the opposition, but even then, you are struggling to keep the AI out of your cities. Not much fun. Perhaps if you have been playing Warcraft or another real time strategy game for ten years, this is all second nature. But for a newbie, this is more like work than play."
4,A good game,"Rise of Nations is a very good game, it has smooth gameplay and brings some interesting and very cool innovations, such as having different cities to expand territory, which influences taxation income. I would have givin this game 5 stars, but for the graphics. I play strategy games like Warcraft 3 and the Warcraft 3 expansion set a lot, and playing a 2-D game like Rise of Nations is a bit of a let down after the other 3-D games I play. I've heard people say that the AI is too hard, but I had no trouble beating the computer on moderate after a few hours. The AI is very versitile and has many difficulty levels, which is a very good thing in strategy games, as in some games the AI is weak and slow. Even though the graphics are dissapointing, I would reccomend this game."
4,A good game,"I really like the risk like single player campaign. I would love to see that part of the game for multiplayer. This is a great solo game but I am more of a multiplayer kind of gamer. Unfortunately, this game doesn't have a big multiplayer following so finding good games on the net is kind of hard."
5,Risk on steroids,"Everything I love about Empire Earth is here, plus some. The graphics are not as great as some of the newer games, and if you play too many characters (people or bots) on the larger maps, it can sometimes slow down the play, but overall this game is fantastic. You can play a single game, or choose to conquer the world. Best of all is playing with friends on the network -- very very cool. But you know what does it for me? One little thing: when you create people and don't assign them to anything, they go where work needs to be done. So if you've built out a mining operation for 6 workers, and only have 3 assigned, any new people you create and don't quickly assign elsewhere just find their way over to the mining site until all empty slots have been filled. I love this. EE doesn't offer this.One tip - the flashing messages on the screen as your character and others advance can get annoying by blocking your screen a bit every couple minutes. Just turn them off."
3,lacking in some important areas,"Terrain and elevation don't affect gameplay at all, and you don't have walls that you can build. So the game begs you to play offensively. This is really disappointing and limiting to gameplay strategies. Also, though you can toggle some of the settings to make the game progress thru advancements more slowly, the default setting pushes major technology changes every 5 minutes! What is the point of entire Ages of Humanity going by so quickly? You can pause the game and make adjustments, but basically this is an RTS with a slightly more complicated technology tree. If you like Civilization, you may greatly dislike the limited depth and speedy pace of this game."
1,Poor design and play,Poor Design. The World map play is dumb. If you attack (and win) the capitol you get all territories of that country (no matter how big). The battles are the similar to the `Age of Empires' with a few new twists.I was not impressed.
2,Cheap re-make,"I love good strategy games, but this doesn't qualify. This is a cheap remake of Empire Earth. The graphics are worse than that of Empire Earth, and the unit movement is very glitchy.Advise to microsoft game development crew; ""Start over!!!""Yes, the upgrades are cool, but repetitive.This game held my attention for about 4 hours. Then I got sick of it, and was ready to sell it back."
1,Total ...& Unoriginal,This game was a lousy RTS and was simply another ... of Microsoft's to copy other games and sell them for [$$$] a pop. Have you ever played 'Age of Empires' or 'WarcraftII'? Well then you've also played 'Rise of Nations'. I wonder how the programmers of this game can sleep at night knowing that this game is simply a copy of other RTS games that came before it. But this game is MUCH WORSE because its graphics and gameplay suck for a game that just came out in 2003.I'm dumbfounded by the lack of originality in this game as well as all the other [copies] out there.I'll end by saying that this game is like a bad sequel. You expect it to be as good as the original but it ends up being disappointingly worse.
2,I didn't Get the idea of this game.,"Must say i played it for a day and never played again. I really didn't understand the storyline of this game, if it has one. Every campaign has only one map and mission. They just put you in a map to gather resources, develop your forces with endless upgrades and destroy the enemy. There is no more objectives in this game. For me this is like playing always in skirmish mode. Age of Empire was better."
1,IM disappointed,"well, im bored by the monotony of all those RTS games (WC3 is one rare exception). DOn't be fooled by what they called innovative or creative elements that were added to this game. I'd rather spend my money on some European games, believe me or not, strategically, European games are far superior."
1,Missing the Challenge,"I had played games likes Civilization, Age of Empires and Empire Earth. I had found this game to be lacking the challenge. I could end the game in a couple of day. Unlike Civilization, Age of Empires and Empire Earth, it kept me playing for a few months.I would say this is a great disappointment, I had expected more from it. The only plus point about this game is the graphics. It is very good but gameplay - it is BORING"
2,Buggy Code,"Be careful with this game -- while a ton of fun, it managed to corrupt 2 of my computers. The Conquer the World section is a ton of fun, but crashes half way through almost every time."
2,Impractical,This is one of those items you buy then realize it was a waste! It's bulky and just plain impractical...doesn't feel like it's doing anything.
2,"Great concept, comes up a little short (literally)","Was looking forward to this lens hood, with its collapsible rubber extension. Unfortunately* the actual hood only extends an inch out. i wish it was at least twice as long.* the rubber has an unattractive, uneven color, ranging from white to dark grey* the rubber also has a strong, chemical smell to it. makes me a little paranoid.* the base is made out of plastic, not sure how long that will last* it's not worth it to pay shipping to send it back.To its credit, it has* threads on the front end so you can attach a filter* It's similar in appearance and length to this at about half the cost:B&W; B & W 37mm Rubber Lens Hood #900 Lens Hood"
3,"Very thorough book, on American Cichlids only.","This is a beautifully illustrated book with great information, if you are interested in American cichlids only. It is clearly stated on the front cover and spine that this book covers American Cichlids, but that fact is not mentioned anywhere in Amazons info. The book is worthless for what I wanted."
2,"Disapointing, Playboy-style","The power and ongoing appeal of this tale must lie the imagination, because I could not get into Ms. Kloster's photographs. Appeal of the women is surely a metter of taste, but these are all of the heavily made-up, big-hair variety, a la Playboy. The ""action"" is uniformly soft-core and not really intriguing. The lavish sets themselves do not create a real presence for me as much as they seem dressed up and rather silly. Ms. Kloster has some other work I would recommend before this."
4,The Best Crusoe Movie Ever Done!,"I saw this movie when I was like 10 years old. I like it so much I saw it three more times. After that I read the book, which was okay, but I liked the movie better. Hugo Stigliz does a great Robinson Crusoe. The whole film is narrated in first person by the main character ( since there is no other human being to talk with until Friday shows up at the end of the movie! ) There was a sequel to this movie which was more action oriented with the pirates and all that stuff. It was good too, but I liked this one better...even more than Tom Hanks CASTAWAY, which was more realistic, but not fun at all."
1,Worse than the book!,"I found this movie to be boring, even more boring than the book was. The story although many consider it a classic, it's really not great at all. There is a very linear plot: Boy runs from home,joins a ship's crew, a storm hits, he is left all alone stranded on a desert island....That's about it, there's not much to see. Even fans of the book will find the classic book, transferred to a 4th rate movie.Note: This is a great movie to watch if you have trouble sleeping."
5,So glad I found this!,"After my divorce, I was given a copy of 'Created to be a Helpmate' by Debi Pearl and it changed my life. I was able to grow so much into what God wanted me to be in terms of a wife. I thought I was golden when I got remarried, but this book by Dr. Slattery takes that information to a new level. Much more specific, discussing the power we wives have, our preconceived notions about marriage, how to make our opposite personalities work together, what we can do to create and ensure intimacy with our husbands, and a lot more. Even the taboo subject of submission is looked at with clear eyes and spoken of with real love and wisdom. I fully intend to read this book at least one more time in the next three months and then to read it once a year. There are so many truths to be taken in in one sitting. Definitly worth the purchase. Enjoy the wife you become and the marriage you help create, no matter how newly-married you may or may not be. God Bless!"
3,Some Good Some Bad,"This book has some good informaion in it, but I found the over all tone to be pretty negative. At the end of the book she sums it all up by saying that all marriages are disapointing and unfulfilling but that you stay married because you should deny your own needs and wants for Jesus. What she says is not necesarilly wrong, but it was far from inspirational. I like to think that I stand some chance of having my husband fulfill my emotional needs and my needs for companionship."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"If you've never read about submission in Christian marriage, this might be a good book for you to start with. I have read lots on this subject and found this one to be in line with what the other books said (but I did not learn anything new).If you have read extensively on this subject, you might be disappointed with this book, as I was, and I would recommend that you try ""The Excellent Wife"" by Martha Peace."
1,Poor design for children,"This camera is made of a very light plastic that does not hold-up to being carried around by a child. My son broke his the first day just by carrying it by its strap. It is likely that he knocked it a few times, but this camera should be built sturdy since it was marketed for children. Also, this camera does not have flash memory, so if the batteries are removed or loose charge, all of the photos on the camera are lost forever."
4,The Spice Merchants of Riner,Well--they've done it again--I read a book by this writing team a while back--EONTIMEOC--now they have another collection of Christian science fiction--and a good one--the characters are true to form--the stories are good basic science fiction--with a strong Christian theme--so often it would seem--that the scifi genre forgets that people can believe in God and like a good science fiction tale too--this book is hot--on a cosmic scale of 1 to 10--I rate it a 9--can't wait for another one ...
1,Does NOT fit the Velbon 9000,"The description says that it fits the V9000, but it does not. Now I am out $4+ on a $7 product to send it back."
1,not good !,the book comes with a card that have a registration code to study online ! Why didn't I receive it ? I paid 15$ to buy the registration code online ! you didn't send me the card so I need you to pay me 15$ because I did purchase 15$ for the registration code !Here is my email address : nkth82144@yahoo.com
1,Zero stars is not an option,I have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on. This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in. avoid like the plague.
1,BECAUSE ZERO ISN'T POSSIBLE!,"I actually recieved this from a friend of mine, which he bought for $0.98. Anyway, I said that there were television shows that I thought were interesting, but were only sold over in the UK (and so on). He told me that the AR MAX was a REGION X DVD reader. So, I took it home, and decided on buying a TV series that was a Region 2, and just recieved it today, to my surprise (not actually) the damn thing didn't work. Now I'm stuck with a Region 2 DVD with nothing to play it in. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT! If you are buying this for the reason that it reads other Regions of DVD's...DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is junk. However, I am thankful that I didn't even buy this product, but it was given to me. I hope that someone planning on buying this, reads my review first. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!"
1,Don't Buy It! Mine was dead 8 hrs later!,"Here's the deal. In the box you get a CD and a Dongle. Some dongles are also 8mb memory cards. As was mine.You pop the dongle into a memory card slot - it only seemed to ""see"" it when it was in slot #01- and then pop the CD in and boot your PS2.After about a 30-35 second load -which feels like forever- you're treated a pretty slick GUI and upbeat music. The interface is easy enough to use, it auto downloaded codes, I even browsed some save games and everything. Neat.Then I went into the memory manager and as one memory card, an Official Sony brand one was getting full I moved some saves from off it onto the dongle.Then played some games, tested out some codes and had a lot of fun. Fast forward 8 hours from the time of purchase and booting it up I'm greeted with:""Please insert your Action Replay MAX Hardware now.""Wonderful. It now refuses to see the dongle and my saves are trapped on it.Bottom line. Do not buy this. Try a Gameshark instead."
3,DOES work with slim PS2,"Okay, I'll admit I bought this cheat thing for one reason only - to see the ""hidden"" games in GTA San Andreas. It worked just fine on my slim PS2 right out of the box, although there was a long load time as it updated from the website, and of course I had to find the codes and enter them manually since some paranoid loser at CodeJunkies decided to take the GTASA codes down. It takes a long time to put all those dang codes in and it really wasn't worth it for the hidden content. Buy it if you want to tweak your games a little, just don't go overboard or it will freak your PS2 out just as messing too much with Windows will freak out your PC."
5,Best thing ever!!,"Works wonderfully, no problems. I have heard if you update this through the internet, it can cause problems, so I have avoided that. Amazing product, works just as advertised, couldn't ask for more!"
3,very good product,i updated the code list from codejunkies site and was pleased with its performance but because of a review read here i have decided to stay clear of the memory crd manieger there looks to be a problem with it
2,Playstation 2 Action Replay Max,"This CD is good, it is hard to use though. Especially for a child. Directions are not very clear."
1,The version I received doesn't work with a slim PS2,"The AR disc I received would not play in my slim PS2. I checked with Datel and found that only AR versions 3.30 and up will work with the slim PS2. The version Amazon shipped was 3.06. As another reviewer has stated, Datel says that they will exchange older versions for a 3.30 version if you send it to them together with your sales receipt. Not sure if they make good on that offer as I decided to return my AR to Amazon for credit."
3,This version doesn't include media player.,"I read few reviews about this disc and expected it to be able play music and trailers from USB flash drive. Unfortunately the version of AR MAX on this disc is 3.70(build 13080) which don't have media player(it was in earlier versions). I can still use this disc to play DVD's, DVDX application is still there as well as use cheats in games. I connected console to the router and was able to update cheat database, which now includes titles like God of War 2."
1,garbage,just bought an action replay max.. it takes at least 10 mins to run on my first try and then the next time i used it.. it took forever so i gave up... it might be the incompatiability of the earlier models (mines is 30001).. but if it works.. its great..
1,"May be useful, but Corrupted my memory card","All I can say is, I've been using cheat software from day one. I've owned Game Shark stuff, Action Replay stuff, and Codebreaker stuff. Nothing has made me as mad as Action Replay Max, though. It corrupted my memory card, causing the loss of dozens of hours of saved games. To add insult to injury, the corrupted games still take up space on the card, but I can't find any way to recover them. I guess I'll have to reformat the card and wave goodbye to hours of hard work (play)."
1,Don't purchase this product,"You can save 5 bucks, easy updates without buying an online adapter(flash drive is needed), and get superior codes. Go out and pick up a code breaker. You can buy code breaker at www.codebreaker.com"
1,HORRIBLE,This product works just fine but at what coast may i ask AR MAX comes with many problems like the possible corruption of your memory card and the fact that using it to much on any one game can totaly ruin it because it changes the game itself you can alter the codes to much and say good-bye to your game i used it to much on kingdom Hearts and now the game turns on for about five mins then freezes and shuts down so if you do bye this product keep this in mind the game is worth more than the cheats
1,If you have the newer slim ps2 design then.............,Then this will not work on your console.But if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console.If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark.
2,Cool.. but so S-L-O-W !!!,"This is a great little cheat device to use, but it's unbearably slow on the PS2. I own both the Gamecube and PS2 version, and with the Gamecube one I'm up and running in about 1 minute. With the PS2 version, I literally have to sit there for 5 minutes waiting for the codes to load into the code list. That might not seem like a long time, but imagine sitting there and just waiting for 5 whole minutes.. it gets really old really fast. Sometimes I don't use it just because of how irritating the wait is.The good part is being able to download codes off the internet and transferring them to the PS2 on the included memory key. Well, copying over the new codes takes quite a while too, so prepare to wait for that as well. I really don't know if the PS2 is to blame or the Action Replay.. but it really should be faster."
1,Not with PS2 model 50001!,What a complete waste of time could not get it to work on my new playstation 2! Intec support is useless as they seem to not know the answer to any question. Make sure the store you buy it from excepts returns. UPDATE: Finally got an answer from Intec had to ship my disk back for an updated version. Works fine now and I'm happy with it. Word to the wise make sure you keep the CD clean and unscratched!
2,This thing actually has a use now...,"I honestly do not like cheat devices, but since Wild Arms 4 came out, it actually now has a use. Let me explain...Unfortunately, thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Puplishing (the company that translated Wild Arms 4) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device, or a similar device like a Gameshark. Since this is the cheapest of all said devices, if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game, you'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this.If it wasn't for this reason, I wouldn't even be interested in this product."
4,Need help beating that game? Here's your solution,"I got this action replay because I no longer have reflex or free time or 10 year old to finish games that I like. Although I prefer playing the game the way it is written, many times I just don't have enough time to do all the dirty work - like collecting experience points and collecting money.This worked as advertised. It is little hassel to load this up _every time_ I need help. Since it take a while for this to load up, it's not convenient as popping my game disc and playing.I think it works reasonably well.. Used on 2 games so far. It's unfortunate that this doesn't let you play import titles. I've heard gamecube version had that functionality.It has tons of codes already on the disc. Unless you are trying out a recent game, you don't even have to enter a code."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT - Costs you more than you paid for!!,"AVOID THIS PRODUCT, wait till PS3 with it's Hard drive an hope something better will come out.Memory cards are flash memory an flash memory is FRAGILE, one whoops an it's destroyed.Damn to hell Sony for making us pop 25 bucks a memory card in the first place.BAD:STAY AWAY FROM MAX MEMORY MANAGER... DO NOT LOAD GAME SAVES FROM THE INTERNET ONTO YOUR MEMORY CARDS. IT WILL CORRUPT AN DESTROY YOUR MEMORY CARD/CARDS. One memory card is worth more than this stupid thing. I lost two memory cards an ALL my bazillion hours of gameplay.ALSO... the disc sucks, when the PS2 is warm, it won't recognize the disc & if you break or mess the disc up, no way you can make a copy of it an use that. Your screwed!GOOD:The codes work an it's great to whip through a game that was driving you nuts or stressing you out before.If you have complaints, call Datels US office(727) 431-0650"
2,CAN I USE THIS FOR SOCOM CA?,i have socom ca socom 2 and socom 3 will this work on any of them?i also have call of duty big red one and call of duty ff
3,Nice tool but a bit heavy,Im a contractor and use this tool almost every day. When receiving it I was a little surprised how heavy it was and it quickly developed some surface rust from using it outdoors. I take care of my tools and always wipe them down after use in the rain but this one must have a sub par coating on it. I may try wiping it down with some bees wax to help protect it better. The other prob I found with it was that the rule's edges are very sharp and need a bit of dulling with some emery cloth.
2,Not for me,Very good product except for the fact that this model comes with a regular finish on the blade which is difficult for and old guy like me to read in the wood shop......so I exchanged it for model number C33H-12-4R which comes with a satin chrome finish which is much easier to read under artificial light. Having compared the two the 11H-12-4R is just as well made as C33H-12-4R.
4,Good tool for the price,"I bought this square to set up my woodworking tools. I am an engineer by profession and work with tolerances in the millionths of an inch. I got this knowing that Starrett is a name brand and has a long established history for quality. Overall I am pretty happy with this square and it appears to be quite accurate. If I were to find a gripe with it is the fact that the ruler has a flatness that is just over .010"" along its entire length, I checked with feeler gauges and almost sent it back but then convinced myself that this should be acceptable for setting up my saws etc."
3,Rusty,"I bought a Starrett 11H-12-4R Combination Square with Cast Iron Head and Black Wrinkle Finish, and it's stained and a bit of patina/rust on the blade. The head it's in excellent condition. I think this was for improper handling/storage.I'm from Mexico, so, return the square ts not an option because it's cheaper to buy another one."
1,Very flimsy. Handle broke within minutes.,Very flimsy. Handle broke within minutes. What more can I say?
2,Academic Study of Saladin and his role in the Muslim Empire,This is a dry biography of Saladin and his role in the Muslim Empire. It provides a thorough study of the rise of Saladin and his family and the politics of the Arab world. There is little in this book to bring the man or the period to life for a lay reader interested in Arab history.
3,Kate and Allie,"I also hope that they are not releasing syndicated version of this show. HOWEVER, since it only says SEASON ONE and not THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, I have the feeling that it will be the syndicated version. I have found that to be the key. SEASON ONE (or whatever number) means syndicated. THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON (or whatever) means uncut episodes."
4,Great show - disappointing quantity :-l,"I love Kate and Allie. Watching it brought back memories from when I was a kid - I watched pretty much all episodes.I was disappointed though, that there aren't many episodes here. What they should have done, is combined a couple of seasons to make this a more complete package.Look at Kate's date in the first episdoe - a very very young Kelsey Grammer. Funny. There are some cute story lines here, but not enough material."
5,Wonderful show,This is a wonderful show but one wonders why the distribution is lame to say the least.
3,Buy the Canadian version,"Seriously, go to Amazon Canada where you will find the complete seasons 1 & 2 in one set at less than the cost of this U.S. Season 1 set. It is the same DVD format, so don't worry. This is a little dated as a series, but it does hold up, and really was groundbreaking for its time. 5 stars for the Canadian set, 1 star for this set."
1,"A """"Universal "" Ripoff",This is not a review of the series but a critical coment on Universal's marketing procedures that should be protested. Besides Kate & Allie-Wings and That Girl are being released this spring. The latter two like Kate & Allie were short first seasons-However Sony and Paramount are releasing both seasons 1 and 2 for only 7 dollars more than Universal is charging for 6 episodes of Kate and Allie. Why didn't Universal do the logical thing like the other 2 studios and release seasons 1 and 2. Greed? No respect for the consumers? Shame on Universal Studios!!
1,seasons one and two available for less,"If you like this show, you can order seasons 1 AND 2 from amazon.ca for about the same price counting curency conversion and shipping. I just got all 28 season one and two episodes delivered from them. This 6 episode set here is a complete rip-off.The only I give the item 1 star is value, the show is 5 stars all the way."
1,Wait a month and get the real deal,Just noticed that the Canadian release of Kate and Allie will feature the complete first and SECOND seasons at a fraction of the price - preorder $25.00 Canadian dollars (about $20 US) on the Canadian website! Hold off a month and go for this package of 28 episodes (plus bonuses) out on June 6th.
1,BEWARE OF MAJOR RIP-OFF!!!,"As other reviewers have stated, this ""Season One"" is only six episodes long since this show was originally a mid-season replacement. I'm so glad I realized this before the item shipped and was able to take it out of my cart. Why can't Universal release seasons one and two together? The marketing genius at Universal who decided to release six episodes at such an inflated price at should be fired. I agree with the reviewer who said Universal is displaying their greed and disrespect for the customer. Over $20 for less than 3 hours of the show? I don't think so. The SERIES itself gets 5 stars, however, I am only giving this craptacular packaging one star. I'm waiting for a full season 2."
3,Too Much for ONLY SIX Episodes,"Kate and Allie is a great buddy comedy. It had heart. It was not Lucy or Laverne & Shirley--it was character driven by human emotion and a love of family. It was a sitcom above the restWhat ticks me off is the high price for SIX (yes 6 ) Episodes. Somebody lined their pockets on this DVD release-Hopefully someone will re-release these six with season twoIts worth five stars, but if is was more of a price break, i would rate it higherBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
1,A Huge Ripoff,"I cannot believe that they are selling this as ""Season One"" with only 6 episodes!!! For the price they are charging it would have been nice to have season two thrown in. The sad thing is, this was a great show and broke a lot of the ""rules"" that society had made for divorced women in the 80's. I ended up taking it out of my shopping cart before it was shipped once I realized how many episodes it contained. Hopefully if enough people complain, we can get season two added to the mix. This is the ONLY reason I gave it one star!"
3,"Re-issue of George cartoons, but no Super Chicken or Tom Slick","Most of these cartoons have been issued before in the original 8 tape release of George of the Jungle. Unfortunately, this time it is only George. The better cartoons, Super Chicken & Tom Slick have not been included. I would suggest getting the original 8, the asking prices of the used copies reflects the popularity of those over these.THE GOOD NEWS: This tape is recorded in the SP quality mode!Tape includes:""The Sultan's Pearl,"" (from Vol.5)""The Agent,"" (aka The Forest's Prime Evil)""Animal Power,"" (aka Next Time Take The Train from Vol.6)""Little Scissors."""
5,The book came in good condition,Was very happy that the book arrived in such good condition. It is nice to now have all of the books of the series.
4,Great book,"I only rate this book a 4, because the first book in the series, ""The Frontiersman"" is the best, and I rated it a 5. But really, this book is great reading."
4,Great for Beginners,"This exercise video is a wonderful starting place for those of us who have trouble jumping into a heavy duty workout. Simmons takes you through a warm-up phase, a workout, and then does stretches, some in a chair as a cool down. If you are already fit, this is going to be too easy for you. It is aimed at(and very well, I must say) at out of condition beginners. If you are in that group, this is a great tape."
4,Recovery Exercise,"I just went through surgery related to breast cancer and ""discovered"" this videotape. It has been a perfect way to work on my fitness without the jarring associated with many aerobics tapes and the stretches are do-able even with my stitches. I get a safe workout."
5,Worth the money!,"If you are over 50 or just in poor physical condition, I'd highly recommend this video. It's divided into two sections: The first section is a low impact routine (and I do mean low!) that just gets everything moving. No complicated dance steps to learn, no jerky motions and no headbanging music. It goes at a very leisurely pace and there is no floorwork. The second section is a toning routine designed to strengthen various muscle groups.Richard leads a group of senior celebrity parents through the program and each section is about 30 minutes long. The only equipment you need is a kitchen chair for the second section.Again, if are physically limited but can walk, Richard Simmons Silver Foxes would be my first choice. Nicely done!"
2,Not consistent,"I purchased this book to help me plan a unit for teaching Bless Me, Ultima to a class of 10th graders. It offers some wonderful suggestions for intro activities and ways for students to work through the book. For example, the author recommends using 4x6 note cards to summarize chapters and he outlines a unit portfolio for students to turn in at the end of the novel. However, the quizzes and tests aren't very good. The quizzes for chapters 1-8, for instance, have questions that require knowledge of chapters 9-12! The glossary at the back is helpful, but the information and glossary in the Cliff's Notes is far more useful as a teaching guide"
2,AP teachers beware,"Though I applaud an attempt at writing a study guide for this marvelous novel, I was very disappointed with the level of this guide. I had hoped it would be targeted at an AP or college-level audience, but clearly it is more appropriate for middle school readers. The questions provided are surface-level at best and the essay questions are not very probing.One bright spot was the addition of a ""translation"" guide at the back of the book for the non-Spanish speakers.Overall, I cannot recommend this book to any educator who teaches above 10th grade."
3,The song playing during the wedding.,"I thought the song playing during the wedding scene would be on the soundtrack; however it was not. I heard the beat on the rapper ""The Game's"" 300 Bars and Runnin' underground cd. It is on a song called ""Olivia."" However after further research I found that the actual song on the movie is called "" Family Reunion"" from Jill Scott and it's on her second cd ""Beautifully Human: Words and Sounds, Vol. 2"""
2,"Disappointed in Soundtrack, but loved the Movie","Don't really care too much for the soundtrack because the songs I was looking for was not on the soundtrack.To RR ""Lovely"" the name of the song that played while Kenya & Marcus was having dinner I believe is ""Change It All"" by Goapele. A song with very liberating lyrics. I've been looking for this song since the DVD came out. I heard it over a friends house this weekend."
3,Something New Moroccan track,Do anyone happen to know the name of the Moroccan track from the movie Something New? I can't find it anywhere! Thanks!
4,Van Hunt,"I knew that Van Hunt song way before the movie was out. So imagine my surprise when I heard ""Seconds Of Pleasure"" in the movie. It was the PERFECT song to play at the time. I think it's a fantastic way of promoting his album, dontcha think? He IS a BRILLIANT artist. Try his other songs ""Dust"" and ""Down Here In Hell (With You). His CD is a definite must-buy. LOVE IT!There is also another song in the movie that I'm DYING to find. It's in the scene where Kenya was on a date with the other dude at the restaurant (what's his name? Kenya's brother's friend? The guy she went out on a date with after she broke out with Brian?)...Can someone help me find out who it is? Thanks alot!!!"
3,Is this really a soundtrack?,"This is a great movie, not over the top on race issues that affect a relationship. . A story of two people falling in love. Situations that affect all races when it comes to dating outside your race. Love is love , it doesn't have a color. Great chemistry between all the actors. The soundtrack is great but not perfect, i wish all the songs were on the Cd . I hate watching a movie , loving the soundtrack, rush out and buy it and all the songs are not there."
3,Just a quick comment,"How could they not include Jill Scott's ""Family Reunion"" on the soundtrack?? I'm so speechless...this was the song that literally wrapped up the movie and went into the end credits. I'm thinking this is for marketing purposes. If so, that is false advertisement for the soundtrack. They want you to buy Jill Scott's entire albums and flip through them until you find out. If she weren't such a formidable artist - almost icon-like matron of neo-soul - i would be furious."
3,Something New Original Soundtrack,"Very eclectic. Some of the tracks were very good and romantic, which I expected given the type of movie they came from."
1,Something New Soundtrack,"I ordered this item in May, 2006 and I have yet to receive it. I did inform you that it was being shipped to my old address and to have it re-routed to my new address at 3853 Chapparal Drive, Fairfield, CA 94534. Please let me know the status of my order and when I finally receive it, I will be happy to let you know what I think of it."
4,"great, but could use more colors.","I like this, but I would like to see more color variety for the packs. and more basic colors. so far easy to use."
4,The best book ever written about Oliver North.,"I enjoyed this book because it told about Iran-Contra Affair from Oliver North's perspective. It also told about his life, his years in the United States Marine Corps, his service in Vietnam and with the National Security Council. The book describes how the White House and the CIA attempted to aid the Contras in Central America. I also liked the book because it also talked about Oliver North's life after his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. This book is really interesting and is worth reading."
4,Under Fire,A very good author. Nice to read his point of view. I have a better understanding of what went on during the time Mr. North writes about
2,The Cocktail on the cover art is the best thing about the film!,"This is a boring, tedious film. The director has no interest in the screenplay, his actors (most of whom are bored beyond description), or, for that matter, anything else. And, Geoffrey Horne! He was the closest thing Hollywood had to a male Bella Darvi! Any wonder his career went absolutely nowhere.One or two saving graces, however: Georges Auric's score and the great Saul Bass's credits."
3,'Whoops',"Would've been more captivating had it been the first time I'd seen this kind of movie, but it wasn't. Technical aspects held my interest -- especially the cinematography; the use of black and white for the present and color for flashbacks was effective. The performances were okay. Jean Seberg is easy on the eyes. Her real life story is more interesting than any of her film roles. It's an inkblot."
5,Amazing movie,"I just saw this movie on the screen at the Film Forum in NYC. I'm a Otto Preminger fan but this time I fell in love with Jean Seberg she is such a natural. So cute, sweet, talented, devious and yet innocent. Her hair style is how Emma Watson (Harry Potter) has now also!!"
5,We've been blessed,"We didn't realize the emotional impact that, ""One True Vow"" would have on us until we read it. We both cried. Eva wrote our story about my long term illness, just as if she'd been living here with us. We've truly been so blessed throughout the long, hard haul that it almost seems a dream that it's been so long. God has erased so many bad memories, but through it all, we hung onto Him. He was our source, as I'm sure he was each and everyone elses in, ""One True Vow.""I'm so blessed that my husband took, ""in sickness and in health serious."" He's upheld our vows.An excellent encourager to those doubting what God can do in their marriage. It should all start from the wedding day and meaning the vows we repeat to one another. Great gift for those intending to marry.Be blessed,Bobbi McGillI pray this book will be used to God's glory."
3,"will only fit Cables to Go Keystone jacks, from what I've read... get these others instead!","1. the Cables to Go keystone jacks have a cutout in 'em so they can lock-in to these things, and apparently that is non-standard ( from what others say about NORMAL keystone jacks not fitting in 'em )2. these, where you get the jacks & the surface-boxen *separately*, are far more expensive than getting 'em together...Therefore:3. what you WANT are probably these things...Cables To Go - 03837 - CAT5E Surface Mount Box 2-Port WhiteCables To Go - 03835 - CAT5E Surface Mount Box 1-Port WhiteCables To Go - 03836 - CAT5E Surface Mount Box 2-Port IvoryCables To Go - 03834 - CAT5E Surface Mount Box 1-Port Ivorywhich I only discovered when I searched Cables to Go for ""cat5e surface""!TIA!"
1,Don't go by the photo. This is just an empty box.,If you are looking for a surface mount box with a jack inside (like the photo shows) this is not what you want. This is just the empty box and nothing else. You have to buy actual jack portion separately. That would not bother me if the photo did not clearly show the jack and punchdown portion that goes inside the housing with it.
3,Good but ...,This was a good romance story. I felt like it was also a lot of History 101. Maybe more history than romance.
3,"Made the Grade: Reckless Series, Book 1","It was a good book, no doubt about that. However, it dragged on enough that by the time I reached Chapter 10 I knew I couldn't finished the novel, so I stopped reading it altogether. =0/Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(To read a teaser from this novel check out my blog)"
3,These refills run out of ink too fast!...,"It seems like every other week I'm replacing black ink in all my Phd multi pens (and I have many so that I'd always have one on hand). I've decided that as much as I love that pen, I need to find a replacement for it just because replacing the ink that often is not very cost effective."
5,You people are crazy,"First off, Over Kill is considered to be the greatest metal band of all time by many of us. You so called ""fans"" should be ashamed of yourselves for writing bad reviews that can only hurt metal music. These guys do what they love each day. What do you 45 year olds out there do for a living? This CD rocks."
2,"Last album produced by Colin Richardson,Why didnt he stay?","I think the main problem with this album is that unlike W.F.O which was completely produced and a great effort, this one sounds horid and leaves much to be desired. Also Linsk is the worst guitarist Overkill has ever had, and i hate to leave out Derek(The Skull) because i don't even know how, or what he contributes to the band. These songs are just boring, and very repetitive as stated in another review. Also whats with Blitz's hillbilly heavy metal ho-down vocals on this album? Its hard to say this album sucks, but its even harder to say it doesnt. Get the new Kreator(Enemy Of God) album instead, hopefully Overkill will get out of there slump with the next release."
1,"Pure TRASH, not Thrash.......","I get so tired of metal masters such as Overkill (& Ozzy, Metallica)who are CHANGING their long loved style of music.THIS IS OVERKILL'S WORSED! Very boring, NO GUITAR RIFFS OR SOLO'S!!!!!!!!!!! Enough reason to not buy it!"
5,ANOTHER MASTERPIECE,"If you are into Overkill, you already know what you are in for with this one. But, that is a good thing! This album is typical Overkill. It is not better than any other Overkill, it is not worse, it just is. It is a great, heavy, solid album from beginning to end. They haven't experimented or messed with their proven formula. Overkill is like Motorhead, it's all kinda the same, but it is always a great album! You'll never get sick of them or toss them aside because they tried to be another band."
1,embarassing release sadly a full out fall on your face fall,Ihonestly tried to like it but i find it an embarassing cd overkill has done many cd some great some not so great but this is the worst(i'm embarassed for them)i find this cd boring and very lame by overkills standards.
2,their worse cd yet sad!,this cd must have been for the money because it lack heart totally.this is easliy there worse songs ever writting and recorded maybe that's why tim left!
1,I wanted to like this album...,"but unfortunetly the band does not allow me to. I have been a fan of Overkill for 16 years and have liked every record up until this one. It is uninspired, boring and poorly produced. Come on guy's...give us something worth listening to. dissapointing at best..."
3,Classic Overkill,"Classic Overkill, the sound and style have not changed but that's sometimes a good thing. Some of the late '80s - early '90s thrash bands changed too much and were never able to capture the feeling they started out with. Overkill is consitent. You know what to expect and you get it. They played a great show in Allentown, PA on this tour, playing songs from the new Relixiv CD that fit in the set very nice, and topped off an awesome night that included metal newcomers Beyond Fallen on the bill as openers keeping pace with the mighty Overkill."
3,Not practical,"Recipes are designed with food that is hard to find and/or expensive. I see this for maybe weddings, and a crowd of very ""fancy taste"" clientele."
1,Bad advice for Pulled Pork,"To a serious BBQ'er Susan's recommendation of ""simmering"" AKA boiling a pork butt in a briny water before smoking is tantamount to sacrilege. I am morally offended by this suggestion. I'm definitely going to knock it before I ever try it, because it sounds like a perfectly good way to ruin a $25 cut of meat. Shame on Susan Wyler."
2,not for any crowd I'd cook for,"Lots of recipes but not what I or anyone else I know would prepare. If you are wanting to cook for people who walk around with their pinky in the air buy the book, other wise pass on this one."
3,"Informative, but lacking in imortant areas","This book has a lot of information about Seattle, its surrounding parks as well as hotels, traveling with your dog, etc... However, its description of parks is short on detail and also out of date as well -- being that it was written four years ago.The back of the book has a list summarizing the best parks -- but it's poorly organized, leaving out Marymoor, for example, which the book earlier mentions as the 'best dogpark in the Northwest.'I'm hoping to find a more thorough and up-to-date guide for me and my pooch."
2,Not Household materials,"If you are a crafts person, like you have a house with a lot of craft materials in it then this book is perfect. I dont have a lot of craft materials. I dont consider craft fabric, tailors chalk, embroidery thread,felt, varnish, extra buttons, fimo, ect. I got these directly out of the book. I dont have any of those things. I couldnt preform any projects because I didnt have any of this. Now if you have some of these things then this book is great! It explains everything with pictures and easy-to-understand words. I'd like to hear your comments too!"
5,Fantastic Orchestra.Abbado is a great Mahler conductor,"What one can say ????The orchestra is fantastic. The soloists are exceptional and the enthusiasm is evident. Like the DVDs of the number 2,5 and 6 we have here one exceptional reading of one of the most problematic Mahler Symphony .Abbado is discrete , conducts for the orchestra and not for the public. The conception of the work is very correct, and maybe this is the most convincing recording of this Symphony I heard. Different from the antiseptic Mahler of Boulez ( conductor that I love in other repertoire)Abbado communicates all the emotion inherent in this work.After seeing and ( principally) hearing this DVD I'm very happy: for the first time the incoherences of the work are no more incoherent . For the first time I enjoyed Mahler's seventh."
5,An excellent blacktail book!,"Boyd's BLACKTAIL TROPHY TACTICS is an excellent book that every blacktail hunter should have. Boyd has made a science out of hunting blacktails and shares information that most hunters wouldn't gleen in five lifetimes of blacktail hunting. If you want to gain a full appreciation for blacktails and the art of hunting them, you must have this book.--Wesley Murphey (author of BLACKTAIL DEER HUNTING ADVENTURES)"
4,Sound Advice for Blacktail Hunters,"Boyd Iverson is a self-taught trophy Blacktail deer hunter. He learned through hard work and observation. He saves the reader some of the hard work and time by passing along his great knowledge in a well written easy to read book called ""Blacktail Trophy Tactics"". I've been hunting Blacktails in California for 40+ years and have taken several with archery equipment, yet I learned a lot from ""Blacktail Trophy Tactics""."
3,Millay,"Millay's poetry are so touching and inspiring to the soul. You can't experience poetry until you read ""Rennaisance"", and so many of her other poems that give you such a love for the human body and the nature around us. R.A.E."
3,Good general introduction to Internet security for non-techs,"The subtitle of this book is misleading, as much of the advice is geared to consumers rather than business owners.However, if you'd like a good overview of risks involved in participating in cyberspace activities of all sorts, the book is worthwhile."
3,Expected great massage type relaxation music,"I wouldn't recommend purchasing this unless you listen to all tracks first.I was not pleased with the depth or complexity of the music. Being a Reiki Master and Pranic Healer and Polarity Therapist, I've purchased quite a few albums over the years. This is on my, ""sell on ebay"" list.It doesn't quite transform or take one on a journey or inspire the imagination. I found Halpern, Master Charles, and some of the others much better and more appropriate for my needs. I am definately disappointed."
1,Very Poor,"This book is very poor indeed. It is very badly written, inaccurate, poorly organised and woefully out of date."
3,Waste of MONEY,"Waste of money yes, to an extent. It took 30 minutes of me repeatedly cleaning the dryer and then the brush, but it did pull out a lot of lint. However, it also pushed a lot of lint down further and caused a clog in my attic pipe which was a much worse hassle than taking apart th dryer and cleaning it."
5,A Money Saver!,Ordered this after I tried to dry an afgan that had fuzz that was so fine it wouldn't collect on the lint catcher on dryer. However it collected at the bottom and refused to move. The dryer would heat up but the clothes would not dry. I inserted the skinny brush down the lint catcher opening and got gobs of this stuff out on the first swipe. There is still a little down there but I have removed almost all of it and the dryer is working again. The only problem I had was the handle needed to be about 2-3 inches longer to get all the way to the bottom. Glad I tried this before buying a new dryer or calling in the repair guy.
1,Awful Camera,"I purchased this camera for my daughter for Christmas. It was small,compact, and fairly inexpesive, perfect for a preteen. First, it took forever to charge (the instructions indicate that it takes four hours). After waiting for hours, my daughter attempted to take pictures, but the camera would not work. The manual shows several different symbols that you should see in the LCD display, but none of these symbols appeared on this camera. I am returning the camera immediately and I would not advise anyone to purchase one."
1,OMG!!!,This has got to be the worst camera out there. I don't even think it's suitable for my 13 year old son. The pictures come out horrible! Good thing it was purchase mainly with gift certificates. I'm still sorry I wasted them on this piece of junk!
4,Eco friendly and it works great!,I don't know about everyone else but I like to cut back on power whenever possible which is why I purchased this! It works very well. Sure my potatoes are VERY slightly lumpy but do you really need them super smooth? It was a great size and even after two years I still love it! I highly recommend. It is a bit on the pricy side but at least amazon offered free shipping. Love amazon!***Would have gave it 5 stars had it not been for the price.
4,very nice masher,This is just what we were looking for - a good old-fashioned type of potato masher and it works very well. Also excellent at smushing avocados for guacomole and mashing the heck out of refried beans.
4,Waffle Head Potato Masher,"Masher is of excellent quality, has a solid feel to it, sturdy and very effective. Best part, Made in America!!"
4,Read some not yet finished,It's recommeded by a former law school student. I read some and did not finish thought it should be a quick read. It could be a helpful guide for personal statement.
5,Better than my own garden,"These were bigger than I expected and are the perfect size to use with the Maxim Treehouse set we have. My kids love to play with their figures and have them put the veggies in the baskets of the trehouse and pull them up on the pulleys. Very durable, but still too small for kids who still mouth their toys. Love this playset."
4,Little wooden garden,Great little garden toy for its value. My little granddaughter has enjoyed it time after time. She played with it at a friend's and wanted her own. It has been a good investment and teaching toy as well and pleasure.
5,Wooden Plan Toys are always a good buy,"Prices for wooden Plan Toys are always all over the map, so it is nice that Amazon has a nice selection of them available with Free Shipping and at competitive prices. Plan Toys dollhouse line is great, and we use them for other dolls (1/12 scale), not necessarily for Plan Toy dolls. I bought this as well as the other garden and have been happy with the pieces. They come wrapped within the box, not loose, and it appears the company takes great care in quality control. Would buy again and am currently purchasing other items from the collection."
4,Fabulous Toy,We got this for my daughter when she was 6 yrs old. She still plays with it in her doll house. (she's 9 now) Very cute and easy to use your imagination to play gardening. very durable!
2,too small not worth the price,"The kids liked it but I was hoping it was bigger. Not really worth the price because it was so small, I would say 5 bucks not 15."
1,A political treatise...,"I found Mr Blanchard's book to read more like a political treatise than a manual for responsible gun ownership. Indeed, I found the book to be more of an NRA recruiting pamphlet than anything else. In his book, Blanchard makes some inflammatory statements about race and religion that he puts forth as fact, when indeed they are opinions.Advocating that gun ownership is fine and good is one thing (and I agree with it). Suggesting that black people are only free if we own guns is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard."
4,Pay Attention Women!,"Kenn Blanchard's first book is an eye opener for many reasons. Chief amongst them is that this book should wake women up. All women should be concerned with their own safety, and Kenn's book is proof.This is an informative book about gun control and the effects it can, and has had, on society. Not a difficult read!"
3,Another Controversy,"The main event of Edgar vs Henderson ended yet in another controversy over who really won just like Edgar vs Maynard and Edgar vs Penn. Edgar and Henderson will rematch once again at UFC 150. I would've like to have seen and decisive finish; but it was still a very good fight.I was dissapointed in the Jackson vs Bader fight along with the Akiyama vs Shields fight. I would've like to seen those fights be a little closer or end by tko or submission.The Hunt vs Kongo fight was short, but the the best on the entire card in my opinon."
1,Feeder not like picture!,"I was very disappointed when this feeder arrived. It is not like the picture of the one I ordered. It is SO small! The one in the picture is navy blue with a different label from the tan one I received. Hopefully they sent the wrong one. No response yet from seller. I Do NOT think this container could hold 3.5 lbs of dry food. The feeding space does not look as wide as the one in the picture. If this is the right one, don' t waste your money on the feeder unless maybe U have tiny, tiny animal that eats a mouth full a day. This review was written several weeks ago and I have not heard from seller or Amazon.com. I reguardly order fromAmazon.com, but will no longer if a response is not given to me immediately!I just read online where another buyer also received a tan one instead of the blue one, and he also was disappointed. You should sell what you advertise!"
4,Just the Ticket,Bought this feeder for my cat to use while I was on vacation. It worked out very well & I'd recommend it to anyone.
4,Feeder,Nothing mechanical about this feeder however it does the job will. Easy to wash and put food. Great for cat. Would recommend! I not giving this 5 stars because it took long to deliver.
4,CAT FEEDER,"This came in very handy when we left on vacation and neighbors only had to check on our cats once a day (or if they missed a day it was OK). It works well until the food gets real low. Then it doesn't feed out the food as well and our cats have to use their paws to pull the food out. However, since it has a fairly large opening this is not as hard as it could be. All-in-all, a good product."
4,What See Is What You Get...,"The food dispenser turned out to be great! now for the waterer, well is over flows so don't invest in it."
2,Brindle Boxer water bottle,I was dissappointed in the size and quality of this item for the price charged.Would not buy again.
1,Gramma's Gift,The poem is great but the bracelet was just a ribbon. I would have liked it to me a little easier to put on the baby's hand and a little more of a keepsake.
5,ABSOLUTLEY AWESOME!,"a truely great album, the mighty fear factory are almost back to the form the showed on demanufacture and obsolete, christian does a brilliant job on guitars, he may not be technically as good as Dino, but he surely can write some cool riffs!. Burton as good as ever, the new bassist also seems cool, but what can you say about raymond, truely a metal drumming god, his bass drum playing is out of this world!!!, buy, this is a great album, classic fear factory!"
2,This album was lame.,"Ive been a fan since I heard Zero Signal many years ago on the Mortal kombat Soundtrack. Soul Of The Machine was great,Demanufacture was also great, Obselete boring, Digimortal I enjoyed alot. Archetype had a few songs I liked but nothing special. And i read that the band is comparing their new transgression album to Obselete well if this is the case Im getting ready to get disappointed once again. Bummer. I hope things pick up soon."
3,"Damn,","Like many said, Dino was the band. I recommend that you dont buy this album, unless you are a Hard-Core FF Fan, cuz it kindof sucks, but their is a few good songs. Burton didnt do his best on this, and he should of tried harder. The lyrics are pretty lame, except 3 songs, and even then they are still weak. Dont get me wrong, FF are tight but without Dino their gonna just go downhill from here. Id give them 3 years, maybe, and they will be done."
3,That's not Fear Factory,"the first time i listened to this CD i was in shock, i said to myself, Fear Factory could have done better, the second time i listened to it, ahh, alright few songs are good, the 1st, 2nd, 9th, but i was really disappointed, specially after i've heard that they have put a CD together, after we all heard that Fear Factory was to be put in sleep, their best album was and still Demanufacture, that album blew me away, it's a killer album, however i must give credit to Raymond Herrera the drummer, oh my freaking GOD."
4,I LIKE IT,"If you're a long-time fan of FF, then you already know how their music has evolved over the years. If you're one of the uninitiated, it's time to join the club. ""Archetype"" has the best elements of the previous 4 albums all rolled into one. Another outstanding effort. By the way, if it's a surprise to you that metal bands use double-bass pedals, you obviously spend more time listening to Hicky Dicky Doo country music while kissing your cousin on a hayride than you do listening to metal."
1,Don't bother,"Having been a Fear Factory fan for quite some time now, I was staggered to hear album. Anyone who thinks kicking Dino out was a good idea should listen closer. The riffs are not structured very well on this record, and the overall quality in the song structure is scant at best. Some people could blame Dino for the lack of quality (which like most things, is opinion based) on Digimortal, but these people need to think about the rest of the band and their contributions. The softness and the minimalistic hip-hop style was (from what I know of the band) almost completely derived from Christian and Burton. If you compare the songs on this record to those of the earlier Fear Factory records closely, you can hear a massive difference in song writing talent. And if you decide that these earlier songs are better than this album (which I feel is the final nail in the coffin for one of my favorite bands) make sure you take a peek inside at who had a hand in writing those songs. RIP Fear Factory."
1,Garbage,"There are one or two songs on here that are ok, the rest is just crap, the sung choruses are so cheesy sounding it's hard to believe that Burton did them. This cd is even worse than digimortal. It goes to say alot that their own web page promoted this song as a throwback to demanufacture, instead of saying they have fresh new ideas, no, they just have recycled and mediocre ideas. Dino made a good call to leave the band, Fear factory are dead on cd. They rule in concert though."
2,tired,"MY GOD is this band tired. Not only does every album have pretty much the same sound but the tracks are in the same composition on every CD (ending with neoballad.) Dino left the band because he was bored as hell and I don't blame him at all. I went to their concert last month and I could tell that even the band was bored with it's own music. Burton comes out and just acts like ""ok here's another show."" He doesn't take it seriously at all. This band needs to stop now before the memebers kill themselves because there is nothing else to do that would spark creativity. The songs on this CD are better than digimortal but that's not saying a lot. If your going to get a fear factory CD just buy demanufactured or obsulete, they were just starting to feel drowsy when they made those."
1,FILTH!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"Garbage, 3 songs that are worth anything, and one of them doesn't have any singing in it, kinda a trance thing. I despise this album and can't believe that it has such a high review! I would give it negative stars."
4,Simply Awesome!,"I waited a long time to listen to this album for fear that they would be sub-par without Dino. Boy was I wrong. Corporate Cloning is one of their best songs in years. Bite the hand that Bleeds is an awesome ballad-type track. Burt's clean vocals are the best they have ever been. Ray's drumming is amazing as always and Christian's bass shines through. However, this is a four-star album because without Dino, there is a shortage of memorable riffs. It doesn't matter that much because the songwriting is so strong. The title track takes shots at Dino (""The infection has been removed, the soul of this machine has improved""), And they have (since Digimortal, anyway). Is it their best album? NO. That distinction belongs to Demanufacture, but Archetype is still a worthy purchase. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy it!"
5,FF wants your soullll,"I admit that i wasn't a fan of fear factory since their debut because i was way too young but i do own obsolete,digimortal and now i just bought archetype which i realy fell in love with it. I love the songs here & it dont sound like obsolete or digimortal at all. If your a fan of ff and want to keep it that way then get it."
3,In the Mood,"When I popped this CD in I expected Hardcore beats, knock me out of my seat thundering riffs, what I got was a heavy Depeche Mode. Don't get me wrong, being an eclectic music lover I give DM props, but that was not what I was expecting. Listen to ""The Hand That Bleeds"" and you will know what I mean. In contrast, ""Slave Labor"" delivers if not exceeds my expectations, but the overall feel does not. Are sythesizers and electronic keyboards back? Is the Krokus generation making a come back? Artistically it is a great CD and I truly enjoy it, but if you are looking for Hatebreed, Chimaira, or U.P.O. keep looking, this is not the CD for you. If you are a Depeche lover looking for a harder edge you have hit the mark ... buy it now!"
4,good to have them back,"3.5 stars- for Fear Factory, I'm happy with this album. Some lacklustre tracks, but more hits than misses easily, and burton and raymond put in enormous performances.To the guy that criticises Christian for using the low (B by the way) string too much... have you ever heard Fear Factory before!?!?! The machine gun low string riffs have been their signature sound for so long...Some vicious moments, some big melodic (poppy even) choruses, not the extraordinary comeback of Machine Head (TTAOE i truly believe to be their best album) but nonetheless good to see them going for it again. The clipping on the guitars isn't very well hidden. production wise the guitar is a little weak compared with those early Dino tones. But a Fear Factory fan should be satisfied with this one, plenty of good stuff, especially considering all the problems they've had- here's hoping they still cut it live!!"
5,The Best Album I've Bought all year!,"O MY GOD!! I can't remember the last time I bought an album and thought that every song on it was atleast good. My fav song is Archetype but, I thought most of the songs were really good! The last two tracks were the only two that weren't amazing."
2,DINO WAS FEAR FACTORY,"LET'S FACE IT DINO WAS THE TRUE METAL FORCE WITH THE SOUL AND PASSION IN FEAR FACTORY,BURTON SINGS U2 SONGS IN THE SHOWER I F**** HATE U2 AND CHRISTIAN WAS NEVER A HUGE FAN OF METAL AND IT SHOWS ON THIS RELEASE,SURE CHRISTIAN CAN DO A GOOD IMPERSONATION OF DINO BUT HE LACKS THE SOUL OF DINO BECAUSE HIS HEART DOESN'T LIE IN METAL THE NEW ALBUM HAS GOT NO BALLS,IT IS TIME TO MOVE OVER FEAR FACTORY,SWEDISH METAL AND BANDS LIKE KILLSWITCH ENGAGE,CHIMAIRA AND LAMB OF GOD KICK YOUR ASS,YOU USED TO BE MY FAVOURITE BAND,LONG LIVE DINO CHECK OUT HIS OTHER BANDS BRUJERIA AND ASESINO BRUTAL METAL THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE."
2,fear factory really needs dino back,"I got my archetype cd yesterday and listened to the whole album and realized that it doesn't really change except for the last 2 tracks. They got rid of their signature sound and have hardly any keyboards in it. The first single cyberwaste, what is so cyber about it hardly has any real electronic stuff in it and the video I saw on tv and it looked like everyone else music video low budget and not creative, just the band playing to a crowd of people. Look at the resurrection video from the 98 album it was creative and cool. It seems like fear factory tried to sound like every other metal band played on tv. Lets face it their best albums are demanufacture and obsolete and it is going to be extremely hard for them to top those 2. I give it a 2 out of 5 because you get a pretty long album and a cool dvd and the album wasn't that bad overal just could be a lot better and after digimortal I really thought that any follow up would be much better but I guess I was wrong."
1,"Ugh, didn't these people break up?","After listening to this CD my only question is WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? I thought Fear Factory was no more, that was why they released that blast from the past retrospective, CD 'Concrete' a while back; because they needed more money to hit the strip clubs and drink their liver out or something. I guess they had a little extra and found themselves sober enough to get to the studio... unfortunately not nearly enough to produce anything of quality. This band has no soul. Maybe the reasol 'Soul of a New Machine' was titled that way because their drum machine has more emotion & soul than they do when they play their instruments. Fear Factory is such a tragedy, even more so than the downfall of Static-X after the first CD. Pain... PAIN!"
2,give it up,"about 10 years ago there were 4 guys looking to mesh the sounds of godflesh and napalm death. well, they couldn't get it right and over the course of 10 years(going from ""death industrial"" to ""metal"" to nu metal back to whatever the f*** they're at now) they still haven't gotten it down. apparently they're not rich enough yet so they have to keep releasing this filth. and of course their pimple faced RPG playing fans will cream themselves over this junk. fear factory-get dead"
1,These guys suck!,"If anyone out there thinks these guys are good musicians, then you really haven't listened to much music and really should explore what's out there. The only semi-original aspect of this band's sound is the over-use of the ""machine-gun"" sounding double bass sound they use. Unfortunately, it is a gimmick! The drummer is using two Duallist pedals that create a double-stroke for each foot/leg motion. Hence the double-stroke bass drum. If these guys are ""The Standard"" for metal's comeback then I think I'll pass."
4,I thought it was Dino the whole time!!!,"I had been listening to this album forwards and backwards, inside and out. I had no idea that founding guitarist, Dino had left the band until I discovered the news online. Before then, I thought Dino played all of the guitars on this album. (I recall even saying, ""Dino's playing is improving."") This just proves that Christian Olde Wolbers does justice to Fear Factory.The first time listening to tracks 4 and 5 made me want to listen to them over and over again. Track 9 has one of the best choruses I have ever heard. It's melodic, heavy, and dark simultaneously, just the way I like it. This FF album is better than every preceding album."
4,You'll need this book...,"This book is a valuable tool for those taking the FTCE.It reviews every competency you'll need to know for this exam, including a neat summary of the basic psychological theories at the beginning of the book. I took this exam in 1998 without any prep book like this available and I did pass the exam.This book tells you the pass score needed. At the outset I was thrown by the questions, but the strategy I adapted apparently payed off.Going in, all I had to prepare me was the skimpy test booklet provided by the State of Florida certification division. But if you're really serious about getting through this exam at the first go, then this book is a must. I am now using this book as a tutoring aid when I coach others for this rather quirky exam.One quick hint for test-takers: this particular exam's questions are best answered by the process of elimination.Good luck!"
3,"A good, not great, CD",These are basically re-runs of old radio shows and good from that standpoint. Chet Atkins was great as usual.
3,"For Journalists, For Sure...","This book was a disappointment after reading all the glowing reviews.First, this is an anthology of writing columns by author and the book has a cut-and-paste feel to it.Second, this book is primarily for journalists.Although this is a good book it definitely reads like a newspaper column and lacks the feel of a great book despite all the five-star ratings."
5,Cute Bathroom Read,"Sorry to be crude, but this book is great to read in the restroom. Makes me feel happy reading all the little sayings."
4,A Guitar for Christmas,"I enjoyed the superb musicianship of Robin Bullock! I stumbled upon this by accident but will certainly be purchasing future CDs. I rated this a 4 only because I was hoping for a better balance of upbeat songs with ballad type songs. However I do enjoy it immensely and have been able to better educate my young children the sound a classical guitar makes. All they thought a guitar was good for is rock n' roll! Sooo, being that my son wants a guitar for Christmas, this CD was a necessity in our home. Beautiful sound, excellent musicianship...well worth the money."
2,Favor boxes,"I kind of felt jiped. Found the same package at Michaels for cheaper. Oh well, business is business."
5,It is in the top seven books about Y2K in my opinion.,"This is MinnesotaSmith, author of a Y2K website. I am proud to know J.C. Cunningham as a friend. His book is one of only seven (out of the hundreds currently available) books related to Y2K that I have classified as ""must-buys"" on my website. It covers practically every topic you will have to consider for getting your family to the other side of Y2K, and gives you numerous leads to follow to go further. There are many resources listed both to obtain goods and additional information. If you think there is any chance Y2K could be much of anything at all, you should obtain this book.END"
3,Nice feature rich phone at an affordable price,"I have been using this phone since quite some time now and I have been very impressed with the features this phone offers at such a low price. The voice clarity, battery life, speaker phone, LCD display and overall build quality are amazing.The only regret is that it has a limited phonebook memory...It allows only 100 numbers to be stored and you can store only one number against one name. Also, it does not display the name of the person from the phonebook, if a call is received from that particular number."
3,"Great product, but broke in 6 month","The base broke in 6 month, but it's still on the warranty and now is being send to Uniden for repair. On-line RMA request process is very convenient and easy to use.UPDATE: Uniden replaced the phone (base and headset) in the timely manner. Great customer service"
3,Ok unless you are really in to ringtones,I've had no problem at all with this phone. Great battery life.I love the fact that everything lights up. I just wish it had more or different ring tones. There are about 12 of them and they are mediocre at best. Going to buy another cordless and put this one in my daughter's room.
1,The Window,"Poorly translated. Doesn't match poetic intent nor tempo.Translation is a bit of an word for word english repetition of text rather than concentrating on the poetry. After all it is poetry that is being translated. Without knowledge of the Hebrew, poems appear very bland and soul-less."
5,Ahhh yes...,I got this soundtrack not really knowing what to expect since i had never purchased a video game soundtrack. I loved the music in the game but wasn't sure if it would have the same affect listening to it on my ipod...but it does. This is some great music if your a Halo fan or just a fan of music...awesome!!!
5,Great CD,"Recieved this item in excellent condition, Recieved it much faster than I expected. Two thumbs up on this one!"
3,"Great Game, Mediocre Soundtrack","The game ""Halo"" was awsome, no doubt about it. I expected a great soundtrack when I bought this. And, in some aspects, it is great. I enjoyed listening to ""Opening Suite"", ""Rock Anthem"", ""Halo"", and ""Brothers in Arms"". However, most of the other songs are ploddingly familiar drum beats and orchestral sounds.This isn't a bad soundtrack; Halo fans (myself included) should be pleased. However, if you've never played ""Halo"" or just don't like it, you should proabably spend your money on a Final Fantasy soundtrack instead."
3,wrong disk,"A sticker on the packaging advertises a BONUS DVD with the HALO 2 trailer, demos and more music, but the second disk that came in the set was actually for Bible stories. Obviously a mixup in packaging and a lack of quality control."
2,Not as good as I remembered,"Besides the memorable main theme (punctuated by strong a cello section), I found the majority of the album lacking spirit or liveliness, that is, boring."
3,Recreation,"Why the only three stars? Because of the (not so) audiophile quality.While the quality of the arrangements themselves are superb, the limited sonic life of the songs remind me to much of a lifeless General MIDI sound module and therefore lacks drive and FATNESS. If you are into audio post/production run it through some tube compressors (with low ratio of course) or a similar audio enhancement and your get close to the vibe this fantasic record deserves to sparkle with."
4,A Great Game and a Good Soundtrack,"I really enjoyed Halo and I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Its funny, but listening to the soundtrack at home and in the car made me realized how much ambient music Halo had.Playing the game after listening to the soundtrack is more of a treat. It really places you more in the game and you anticipate your favorite sections. Lasty, if you have a sub in your car prepare to be blown away. This CD is heavy on the bass and will keep you awake.PS - This soundtrack won Rolling Stones Soundtrack of the year for an electronic game (PC and Console). That's how good it is."
5,Awesome soundtrack!,"Great soundtrack, just like the game. Very easy to relax to and drift off thinking of the story. Worth the money several times over!"
5,If you are a fan of Halo and its music...,You will want this CD! Most of the music you hear in the game is a shortened version of the score that was written! It is an eclectic mix of contemporary rock with a classical flair! I strongly recommend this to music lovers as well as gamers that enjoy Halo!
5,NOW- Thats what I call great game music,"HALO: Original Soundtrack is everything everyone says and more! The pure instrumentals of the music can reach into your soul and make you wonder how somebody reached into Heaven and grabbed a choir of instrumental angels. This CD is beautiful who has not fully enjoyed the music in the background of Halo, or even someone who loves the music and would love to be able to hear it all the time. Though later there will be a special Halo Soundtrack avaible with more songs and extra features right now, this is the one to buy!"
3,It's cute My son likes it but not our favorite....,"This book is OK, yes it does teach a bit about getting dressed but in a boring way -- it's written in the same tone as Elmo's world the show i.e. Elmo says this....what do you say? (speaking in the 3rd person). My son enjoys it but it's not our favorite. It is colorful and has pictures of children which I think may be his favorite part."
2,"Oh, Brother! Not Very Good At All!","This book started out okay then went downhill very quickly after the first couple of chapters. I think the authors lost me somewhere after getting the notebook and writing a bunch of dreams and desires down. It was too run-of-the-mill for me.Then it gets worse. It talks about affirmations (like every other self-help book out there) and the same rehashed every other self-help guru talks about.I wonder if the authors of this book are rich beyond their wildest dreams. I can almost guarantee that they aren't. They remind me of hippies running around the country preaching love, prosperity, and happiness while living in a tin-can trailer with dirt between their toes.I recommend The Trick to Money is Having Some and The Little Money Bible, both by Stuart Wilde.Pass on this book for sure!"
2,Nothing Magical,"I purchased this book several years ago - pre law of attraction craze. Read it diligently, wrote in my notebooks and had other family members do the same. Fast forward to today (Feb. 10, 2010) I was cleaning and came across piles of notebooks and I'm disappointed to say, none of what I had written down came to reality.This book was an enjoyable read but I like, Write it Down, Make it Happen much better. It helped me land my first radio job out of college with no experience!Reviewed by M. L. Woods"
3,RIght up until it started preaching.....,"Okay....LOVED the book....right up until the author started spewing his religous views and similar ilk. UGH! Thanks. If I want that I'll read the bible thank you. I LOATHE being ""preached"" to....or told that the only way to success is to worship according to someone else's beliefs."
4,"Great, but could have been better!","I liked this book a lot, and it was very interesting. I especially liked the ""assignment"" of buying a .79 cent spiral notebook, and creating the lists of what you want in life. I still use the notebook, and refer to it often keeping it updated. The book could have been MUCH better, but sadly, the authors use it to pitch their $2,500 Quantum Selling and Quantum Marketing seminars!"
4,IM rich beyond My Wildest Dreams Book,I started reading the book & am halfway through it.. i like it alot. Very informative & i believe what it says to be true. I will be doing all the exercises it says to do & will see what happens. I am optimistic...
4,George Petrossi,"Such a balance in sound, and such a perfection in interpretation. Theinstrument in the skilful hands of Moazen turnes to a living beeing able to express the most hidden and pure emotions of artists rising from different cultural eras. The Flamenco is as lively and exact as the Indian music inspired Latin tunes, or the modern pieces. And when it comes to the guitarist's own compositions, one can absolutely feel the mystical soul of Iranian music. Here guitar finds allit's values.George Petrossi from Chicago"
2,Nothing new - amature production,"I bought this DVD hoping for some keen academic insight that I could offer my college students as an alternative to the liberal media ""scream"". This DVD fell short on credibility. It does state up front that it is biased, OK. But it never offers a counter position -- never. At least INDOCTRINATE U demonstrates reasonable ""investigative"" reporting. DO AS I SAY is truly preaching to the choir. Plus, it is very boring. I do not recommend buying this DVD if you can watch it on YOU TUBE instead."
5,This is the best financial dictionary on the market,"I think highly enough of this book that I've given it to many of my clients, and I'm giving it to more clients for the holidays. When buying this book, I looked at them all. This one has the depth that I need, and in simple language that I enjoy for myself and my clients."
5,Nougaro,I fell in love with this jazz-pop fusion while I lived in france. And I still love it. The music on this disk melds its self to your mood and never misses a beat. It will be as beloved to you as your baby blanket.
5,connection and growth,"After reading Taylor's ""An Altar in the World"", I read this to get more context and understanding for what she was going through, but it's an amazing work on its own. Reading about her attraction to religion, I felt connected to her; understanding her following burning-out experience sounded like a clear warning for me (who is in the process of applying to seminary); seeing her growth and understanding of God in all aspects of life is entirely refreshing. I'd recommend it for anyone who labels themselves Christian - it lends a greater understanding to just how big and all-encompassing our God is. I also recommend it to people who find themselves repelled by the label (and culture of) Christians - it explains what's going on under the surface for some of us."
2,Not Her Best,"While this book is a memoir of a woman leaving the parish ministry, it does not seem as she has left ""church"", if by that she means the Episcopal Church. When I completed the book, I felt as if she had been describing a time in my own life (and I am not a priest) when I was overworked, pushing myself too hard and not having time to think. A contemplative, which I take Ms. Talyor to be, needs space and time alone. This book could be about any perons who does not seize the time for quiet in whatever occupation."
5,A kindred spirit,"I felt like I found a kindred spirit as I read Barbara Brown Taylor's journey of faith. I didn't want the book to end any more than I want a good coffee time with a friend to end. Barbara remains respectful throughout even as she ""camps out on the edges"" of the church world. A beautiful memoir."
5,"""Leaving Church? or Leaving Home?""","This is a book that I do not want to finish. It is jam packed full of liltingly descriptive prose of how her life grew bigger as she became smaller. We are allowed a secret look into her most sacred changing world - her life!The author spins a thread through all humanity (especially those who work in ""The Church"") gathers us all up, and strips away any self appointed entitlement that may be perpetuating our walk.She knows that under all our fine wrappings, we are completely naked."
4,Cool Picks,These were a birthday present for my husband and he loved them. Good way to make playing that much more interesting.
1,very poor quality on reprint,this is a review of the reprinted hardcover version.i purchased this book having read a friends copy. upon receiving my copy i was bitterly disappointed. the layout is atrocious. the reproduction and re-sizing of the photos substandard and the text is misaligned. it looked as though an eight year old had printed it on a home computer. this for AUS$80. random house should be ashamed of themselves.
4,Love her books,"I look forward to what ever Nigella writes about and her books, columns and other articles. She is a wonderful passionate cook with a great deal of interest in enjoying life, all of it. It comes through in her recipes and books. Not only that, she is pretty....a beautiful woman who loves to cook, doesn't mind getting her hands in the sink and mixing up a batch of good things to eat!!Sally larhette"
4,Take note if you're making the chocolate orange cake,"There is a mistake in the body of the recipe that may lead you to believe the cake contains butter. Supposedly, it does not, and this was a mistake on the part of the American publisher. I want future purchasers to know this so you won't have to spend an agonizing afternoon like I just did, second-guessing a recipe (and guessing wrong that butter does belong in the cake) the day before I planned to serve this cake at a party. (It's gluten free, great for your celiac friends.)Now that I've got THAT off my chest ... I love this book! It made Christmas dinner a hit (the Brussels sprout recipe is divine!), and it is beautiful to look at and a pleasure to read, as are all of Nigella's books. Just mark that butter thing on the chocolate orange cake, and you'll be fine."
5,Super Feast,"Nigella Lawson, you are truly amazing, I have been ""feasting"" my eyes overly this truly fabulous and funny cookbook. Not quite sure that Shoprite stocks ground venison however! but I will check this out tomorrow. a real twist on some traditional favourites, cannot wait to try the Xmas pud flames and all. My American version of Feast is great, and to have stockist and websites is a real help. For anyone living in Northern America and cannot get to the fabulous Myers of Keswick in New York try visiting your local Irish store, where you should be able to track down some Horlicks and other British delights.I am only on page 78 and this is the best read since Forever Summer! buy this Cook book as soon as possible and enjoy!"
5,Excellent Customer Service,I bought this for my wife's car. It didn't fit. (Note: Not all trailer hitches are the same size.) All Sales stepped up and sent me the piece I needed to make it fit.
5,Hitch cover,"I bought this because it is so cute, I am very passionate about flip flops, I wear them year round(in arkansas).I thought that they were a perfect cover for me to buy,they got here fast and fit great on my truck. I love them!!!"
4,Book Description,"SWEET RUSH TO RAPTUREShe was Lady Lettice Kenton, one of a long line of titled temptresses with hearts of ice. He was Charles Murdock, and American rebel out of place in elegant, fashionable London. She called him crude. He found her shallow.But on a ship bound for the colonies, in a stormy clash of desires, Charles showed Lettice that beneath her aristocratic pose beat a true woman's heart, yearning as any other for the ecstatic surge to passionate surrender - with a lover as willful and fierce-spirited as the land they claimed in the name of freedom.Time setting is the American Revolution"
4,What a steal!,"I listen to soft music before falling asleep. I have quite a collection, and this is a beautiful addition. Buying it ""used"" made it quite a steal! I highly recommend this CD for soft and pensive moments."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"The product came just as described. No markings, on time. Great book if you are looking to broaden your dance studies."
5,Excellent Buy,Our doctors suggested taking these over a decade a go. The price was cheaper on line than at any other drug store or health place in the area.
5,Great book! All you need; easy to find; beautiful to look at,This book was perhaps the single most helpful investment I made since getting my puppy. The timeline in the back was particularly helpful as it walked me through the day by day process of raising my puppy and pointed me just to those pages I needed on that day. And the piles of photos clarified everything and allowed me to put it into practice with my pup right away. And the results speak for themselves: my pup hasn't started formal training yet but already knows more than my last dog ever did.Thanks for a great book!
5,Best Puppy Book Ever,"Finally, someone who knows what new puppy owners need: answers and fast. Devoid of long and abstract tracts on training theory, this book goes right to what the owner needs, explains what you need to know and solves your problems asap. But it's much more than that. It contains a systematic, rigorous and totally thorough approach to raising your puppy along with tons of photos that show you how to do everything. There's more in this book than in books twice the size. In fact, once you read this you'll set all the others aside for good."
4,There's a Puppy in the House,"haven't had time to read enough of it to give a review but my granddaughterhighly recommended it! Have taken the advice on how to get him to sit, stay, etc."
1,Save your money,"This is a very poorly written fantasy trip from the author. The only people I can image getting anything from this are prostitutes or lebians. It's not for the average married woman, even one with an open mind. Includes very trashy, tasteless language."
1,sexist crap,"I picked this book out of a free pile in a second hand store. I intend to use it for a mixed media piece exploring misogyny and sexism. It's impossible to take the writer seriously. One reviewer here suggests that the author made up his ""interviews"" and I agree. The fact that Mr. Masterton was the first editor of the British edition of Penthouse should tell the reader a great deal about how his sexual sensibilities inform his writing. If you want a good laugh, or perhaps a peek into the mind of a sexual troglodyte, read this book. Otherwise leave it alone."
1,Thumbs down to both.....,"The water feeder was as another reviewer wrote ""a real pain"" and the food feeder is okay if your cat knows how to go to the opening , and use its paw to pull the food down into the dish....it has be a bad idea to leave your pet for a period of time and think this will work...your cat may starve waiting for the food to drop down.....thumbs down to both products....."
2,Amazon vendor delivered product timely,Amazon vendor delivered product timely. Preferred a more automated pet water system in a different category.
4,Chinese Flash Cards,"These Chinese flash cards are perfect for those studying beginning level Chinese with any of the most common textbooks. The only negative thing I can say about them is that Traditional and Simplified characters are completely different sets, so for those trying to learn both simultaneously, you'll need to buy both. Other than that slight gimick, they're exactly what you need if you're looking for Chinese flash cards to supplement your text books."
5,The definitve novel of 20th century Japan.,"Natsume poignantly portrays the lonliness of the modern Japanese individual, inticed by Western freedom while bound by tradition, in this beautifully crafted novel. If you want to understand the alienation of Haruki's characters, this is where is all begins."
3,slow...,"this book is a classic in japan, how eer i think its kind of dull, I had to read this book for a history class, it gives a good perspective of japan during the 1900's."
1,Why?,I'm a college student that has read plenty of classic American novels and when a teacher gave Kokoro to the class. I was kinda intrigued but the first 50 pages made me feel like i was wasting my life away and i convinced my friend to read me a couple pages so i wouldn't have to look at it. I read the book in four days and I'm ready to torch it because i could sell it back to the bookstore for $3 but I don't want anyone to suffer like i did.
4,Amazing Book with a Fantastic Ending,"When you first get into Kokoro, you may think that this will be a boring book. But I urge you to not only look deeper into the words, but also keep reading. Section III of this book was amazing. The detail that Sensei goes into about his life as a college student is amazing, and the there are numerous themes that appear especially in the final section. I was not particularly fond of Japanese writing before I read this book, partially because of lack of exposure to Japanese writing, but after I read Kokoro I immediately wanted to go out and find some more Japanese writing. I promise you that you will not be disappointed with the time and energy you put into reading this sensational book!!"
1,these are not bass clarinet reeds,"before buying these reeds look carefully at the box, these are not for bass clarinets. my son opened the box before i was able to check them out and found them to be clarinet reeds, not for the bass. will be giving them to another student of the clarinet."
3,Okay product but advertising is not quite right,"I have ordered a total of 4 of these, quality not bad, just wondering who is measuring the waist band? Because IT IS NOT 3 inches by any means, it is only 1 and 3/4 inches wide on the waist band for the white ones and the black ones are only 2 inches wide."
1,EXTREMELY POOR PRODUCT,"Ordered two athletic supporters. Both fell apart after the first laundering. Straps came apart from the waist. Would NOT recommend buying this product. Very dissatisfied. No response from manufacturer, despite repeated requests. Bad product. Poor response from maker."
4,good enough,"i find out that is kind of confortable really like it , better if get a size much bigger than you fit,really tight"
1,Product Not As Pictured,"The item received wasn't as shown. The waistband wasn't as wide as it appeared on the website. I have other Bike supporters that look just like the ones shown on the website, but they have an inch wider waist band. I am very unhappy with the whole situation."
3,Seriously? Review a jock strap? It's expensive but works,"yeah, it's a jock strap. yeah, it works. yeah, it's cheaper than a lot of other ones but just as effective. and yeah, even at the price it's still expensive, hence three stars. otherwise it could have gotten 4 stars. just can't rationalize giving a jock strap 5 stars under any circumstances. maybe if it smelled like lavender. can't hardly believe Amazon asked me to review this, but here it is."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was so looking forward to this DVD. Major let down !!!! While it IS funny there is far to much interaction. When I pop in a DVD I want to relax, enjoy and be entertained--instead I was constantly pushing buttons, little time to relax and enjoy-it didn't flow til I pushed a button...NOT my idea of entertainment! Again, don't waste your money..if the DVD was only $4.99 I would say buy it but at $19.95..NO !!! If another one is released I hope there is no button pushing or I won't buy it. Major let down."
2,"Cute, but battery drain problem","I bought this for my 5-year-old son. It's cute and fits nicely in his hands, but it drains two AAA batteries while turned off, in a matter of 2 days! It doesn't matter if they're rechargeable or not...it won't work when you come back to it more than a day after replacing or recharging the batteries. And since it holds the photos in its built-in flash memory only as long as there's battery power, any photos not already downloaded are lost.Picture quality is okay if there's enough light, considering it's a cheap camera, and although it doesn't have a flash it does have a helpful feature where it gives a long beep and doesn't take a shot when the light is too low, thereby saving you time and wasted memory. Obviously, though, I'm going to return this camera due to the battery problem, so its positive aspects will go unappreciated."
1,Son is very disappointed,My son received this camera for Christmas and that day we lost pictures twice and the camera would not take pictures consistantly. We waited for the camera to be off before removing the batteries to change them because the camera wouldn't take pictures but maybe every 4th\5th\6th... try. To only find out that when the camera was turned back on all the pictures (32) my son had taken were gone! Bad choice even for the price.
5,Only one song we like,"One song is the reason for the video purchase. My daughter loves the ""Every Move I Make"" video and calls it ""shoes"". The other songs/videos do not entertain my toddler.2011 Update.. As she has grown so has her love for this video and all the songs.."
4,"Essential Orientation for J2ME relative to ""Samll Footprint""","I have scanned Eric's book and read the first half deeply. Its principal value has been to place J2ME in the larger context of ""small footprint"" Java -- both historically and contemporarily. As with any such text, it helps to view it through the lens of first having a job to do, and second determining if J2ME will help get it done. Eric's J2ME orientation helpfully goes beyond Sun's MIDP implementation to introduce other SDK implementations, including Motorola's and RIM's. Eric argues important distinctions between device profiles -- ""Is the Palm a MID?,"" for example. Unless it has been your job to closely follow the fits and starts of the ""devolution"" of Java ""from its roots as a language for programming consumer appliances,"" this book should be required reading for exploring the potential of the J2ME initiative."
2,Palm code is paltry,"I used the existing web resources to learn J2ME and build a simply text entry Spotlet. Hoping to increase my knowledge and gain some insider tips to Palm development using J2ME, I purchased this book. I am very disappointed with it. In all honesty, I could've written the Palm chapter in this book, and I've only worked with J2ME for 2 weeks. Considering the price I paid, I am probably going to return it on Saturday.I recommend you read the web resources, save your money, and wait for Sun or a 3rd party to create a larger J2ME API for the Palm. If you can't wait (like me), better buy a C reference and start programming in C/C++."
2,Good for beginners.,"The book provides a very good overview for those that are just beginning to do this sort of work. However, the details that are provided are sketchy at best and can easily be pulled from free external sources like the J2ME specification or the installation files from various J2ME Tools.So if you're a seasoned java programmer ... stay away from this book and stick to doing research on you're on. There really is no insightly information that justify the cost of the book.On the other hand ... if you are new to Java and to the J2ME/Embedded programming space then this book is for you."
4,"Good overview book, but ignore the little code that is there","This is a great book to help you get a handle on the Java2Micro Edition. Need to know the difference between a Profile & aConfiguration? Wondering where PersonalJava fits in with regards tothe J2ME?The weakness of this book is the 'code' aspect. Theauthor goes through various implementations with a Tic Tac Toe game,but fails to go through in any detail of the main API's that aren'texactly in the J2SE (Records, Connector, how to draw low-level, Highlevel GUIs, etc..). Also, after reading this book it failed to mentionwhich DataStructures are available. Also, the detail of theimplementations is either slightly out of date, very light orboth.Besides all that, it is a good book (hell it's the only J2MEbook that I know). For an overview book you couldn't ask for more.Easy writing style and helpfull diagrams, but not overdone. I wasinspired enough to write a J2ME game..."

1,Good overview but not for Professionals,The title is misleading. The book is more for a manager than for professional developers. You can get most of the stuff in the book from Sun's web site.
3,Little more than a review of the J2ME specification.,"I like Eric's books normally; but this one is a bit dated and not much more than a review of the J2ME specification, which you could obtain on the internet without buying the book.Lots of spec stuff and very little 'how to...' stuff. Give it a miss and buy his newer book with Ortiz as the co-author."
5,Awesome book for professionals!,"Although this book was published about a year ago, it still has an incredible value to everyone seriously interested in developing applications in J2ME. It is one of those few books that is capable of covering major topics without being too broad and digging deep into details without being boring.Eric explains how to think in Java in J2ME. The thing is that normal Java programming paradigms often will not apply to J2ME, since we have to work in a very constrained environment. The author from the beginning gives you an overview of what can be done and what should not be done with J2ME. Those first chapters are worth the price of the book alone. Subsequent chapters cover the essentials of J2ME for different hardware platforms including Palm OS.All in all, I think this book is a must for everyone who intends to write professional software for mobile devices."
1,Not a good choice,"Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this sprinkler! I went through 3 of them before figuring out they just don't work. The multi-position oscillating part sporadically works, but only at first. It soon quits working all together."
5,Thoughtfully written and thought provoking,"Unlike other dry law school casebooks, Dukeminier captures the humanity in this study of Trusts & Estates. The editor footnotes and some of the case studies read anecdotally--giving the concepts a historical and personal dimension. The notes after the cases study the social implications of the courts' decisions. Especially interesting are Dukeminier's disucssions of the implications on the legal order caused by same-sex marriage and transgender issues. This book is thoughtfully crafted, a must read for law students or lawyers interested in this area of the law!"
5,Easy reading,"This is a very well wrtten text for a very complicated subject. The chapters and sections are ordered logically. First it gives you a definition, then a basic description of a rule, system or method, then it explains exceptions to the rules, THEN you read a case. I wish all of my books were written this way! It was so easy to quickly access the information and know exactly what you are suppose to be getting out of the readings. I would even recommend it as a supplement to another, less accessable textbook."
5,Best Law Text,"I love this book. The authors do a great job of selecting interesting cases, covering the material thoroughly, and adding humorous footnotes that together make this the best textbook in law school."
5,She is so cool!,"I got Tia a few weeks ago (my sister got Courtney, too) and she is so cool! I love her cute clothes and her shoes aren't too bad. Her hair is kind of frizzy, but I don't mind it that much (and my sister did a really cute hair-do with it!). Her purse is so cute! The crown keychain is really cute and her phone and blush are cool. I give this doll 5 stars!"
1,Acu Wrong!,This outdoor thermometer shows the temperature as 10 degrees higher than it acutally is. This is unacceptable! What good is a thermometer that is inaccurate.
4,LTJ's best work since early Earth and Progression Sessions,"Great Jazz/Latin Jazz licks, samba-esc..I would give this 4.75 stars. Not quite a 5 star rating..I would recommend you purchase ""Logical Progession, Level 1"" for the full LTJ Variety trip..First and then this album is in his Top Three or Four downtempo beats. Listen to a few of his Earlier Earth series to check which one also works for you via the Amazon music samplers..His work with MC Conrad is better than most of the downtempo out of the USA so check that out too. If you here a male MC on his works its usually Conrad and he is is much more together than 90 percent of the so called rap masters out their. Also check out Thievery Corps ""Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi"", Rockers Hi-Fi-the group. Kruder and Dorfmeisters ""Sessions"" double cd set.Amon Tobin is also exellent in this Drum and Bass catagory as a root of many sounds heard thru-out this community. Talvin Singhs ""Sounds from the Asian underground"" is excellent too."
4,Not bad at all...,"I'm a funkateer and 70's funk-jazz lover. I was into both the American and British acid jazz scenes of the early to mid-90s as well as their residuals (""trip-hop"", ""downtempo"", and all those other sub-genres), but I wasn't a follower of any particular act. I was never into drum-and-bass, though. LTJ Bukem was more of an abstratcion; I knew the name, but didn't know what he was all about. What made me buy this album? Well, in the space of a few weeks, I heard ""Aztec Girl"" by Jon Beltran on a couple of D.C. radion stations. I loved the song from the get-go, but I couldn't find it anywhere.After hunting around, I found it via Amazon. Much to my surprise, every song on the album is exceptional with Beltran's ""Aztec Girl"" being my favorite closely followed by Makoto's ""You're Divine."" WOW!!! Again, I'm not wild about drum-and-bass, but I even liked Bukem's OWN cuts on this album."
5,Outstanding effort!!,"I first heard of this band on a Limb Records sampler CD titled ""Louder Than The Dragon.[Also an excellent CD] These guys got it down. From mid-paced pounding heavy songs to faster shredders to slower balads. This CD has a variety of song structures but stays in the realm of traditional metal.This CD is a must for any power metal or classic metal lover. The vocals are clear and the singer has the range. The guitarists can fly with anyone and the rythms they fit into each song are simply awesome. There are so many great songs on this CD that it will be in your player regularly. Don't miss out!!!"
1,babble,This book was such a waste of my time. I found the author simply babbled on without saying anything new. Save your money and pass this one over!
1,Disappointing,I found this book to be disappointing at best. Too general. Too elementary. Not at all what I expected or was looking for.
3,Minor Betty,"Not one of her best. Trite story and only one musical number. When there are better examples of Grable's films still on the shelf like ""Meet Me After the Show,"" ""The Farmer Takes a Wife,"" ""Diamond Horseshoe,"" it's puzzling why this is on DVD and the others are not."
5,Flaco's Book,I bought the book for a friend. He is studying the Nahuatl language. He really enjoyed the book and has learned a lot. I plan to buy more for him.
5,Brian Gari Sings Brian Wilson Songs!,I've been a fan of Brian Gari's music for a couple years now and everytime his CDs get better and better. This is a great CD of Brian singing Brian Wilson songs. He has great music abilities and this is no doubt going to be a huge hit for Brian. Way to go! Nice work.
4,Useful tool for professionals,"This book provides useful information for the professional interested in decreasing bullying in his/her school. There are role play scenarios and discussion of teasing dos and don'ts. There are also reproducible screening checklists and surveys to measure the extent of bullying on your campus. How to appropriately conduct an interview with a bully is included as well. While this is not a comprehensive resource, it is a great jumping board to begin ridding your school of bullies and it provides a list of additional resources one may look in to."
5,Comes with a companion CD-ROM of extra material,"A bully can make a student's life miserable and make them hate school. ""The Bullying Prevention Handbook: A Guide for Principles, Teachers, and Counselors"" is a guide for school administrators to deal with the inevitable act of bullying and teasing in their schools. Dealing with both the bully and the victim through counseling is important, as are discussing things with both sets of parents, and how to reverse the damage caused by the act, as well as simply discouraging the act through education. It covers the wide range of types, from elementary school recess about a kid's large ears to cyber-bullying, to far more serious taunting of LGBT students in high school. ""The Bullying Prevention Handbook"" comes with a companion CD-ROM of extra material, making it a must for any responsible school administrator."
2,Too many notes,"Wonderful musicians but not great music. ""In the Moment"" is especially good. This album wears me out with too many notes and not enough space."
3,MELLOW,"One cannot question the skill of these two muscians,they are extraordinary.I being a big fan of Dream Theatre was expecting something with a little more kick.Instead of writing a lengthy review i just want to warn buyers if you get this cd expecting it to raise your adrenaline level you will be disappointed.The songs on this disc i can safely say are relaxing enough for nap time."
5,not too dream theatrish,"this is an awesome peace of music, although it doesnt have much to do with Dream Theater but more with experimental music. my favorite peace is furia taurina which has a really awesome melody that I cant get out of my head :) If you like John Petrucci and you expect some hardcore shredding al the way through, youre obviously wrong with this one, but if you enjoy listening to music you might enjoy this album ;)"
1,Does a good CD Binder exists?,"I have noticed that CD binders(detachable pages) is never as good as a CD wallet(non-detachable pages). The problem with CD binders is that the metal binder is NEVER tight, so some pages will fall out eventually. When the CD Binder is full of 192 CDs/DVDs, the weight is heavy enough to bend the metal out place and makes it extremely loose.The other problem is turning the pages. With a FULL CD wallet, you can move easily between different pages but with a FULL CD Binder, it is packed so tightly that it is hard to flip the pages and IMPOSSIBLE to move from the 1st page to the last page instantly or vice versa.Also this CD Binder has a capacity of 192 CDs/DVDs, so you can't add more pages to it. I was under the impression I could add more pages.The only reason to buy a CD Binder is that it is organizeable. I'm still trying to find a sturdy CD Binder/Wallet that is organizeable, with detachable pages. If you know one, please inform me."
5,Hush... Be still,"This is a collection of the very best songs taken from Nusound's Erotic Moods compilations; compiled/mixed into one nicely flowing record as the smooth, sensual rhythms blend together seamlessly. Some tracks are stronger than others but it's all in all a solid album filled with many different chill-out styles that are soothing yet get the body moving too with synapses of pleasurable melodies riding and stimulating the senses. The moods are meant to be erotic (hence the name) and in a gentle way they are but don't expect to hear dirty beats and/or heavy breathing/moaning here. Instead look forward to some tranquil world and jazz grooves that are perfect background music for a romantic rendezvous with your significant other or to simply relax to on your own.I was pleasantly surprised with this album and, unlike some people have expressed, I do hear the similarities but this is hardly an Enigma copycat. Albeit a good set of tunes, their sound is distinct and can not be challenged."
2,If you have nothing in your collection to date...,"I think this has been stated in other reviews, if you already have Enigma you don't need this album. Otherwise it's decent. I would suggest Babble's ""The Stone"" (out of print); b-tribe's ""sensual sensual"" and Olive's ""virgin"" as other mood music choices. I have yet to find that perfect album that is very sexy but not cheezy - might just have to live with iPod playlists folks..."
2,not erotic,"Okay now, this is not an erotic CD. Don't get me wrong, it is relaxing lounge type music.....but NOT erotic.So I'm still looking for a truly erotic CD that isn't dumb panting or cheesy junk."
4,Decent connector,"This is solid design and still works well after several months. I would've given it 5, but felt misled as I was searching for items made in the USA when this came up (I try hard to support American workers and companies that manufacture locally) .Only when it arrived did I see that it was made in China.So be aware that only some Gilmour items are manufactured in the USA and check closely before ordering."
4,Chester's Way,"I am currently student teaching and I chose this book for a read aloud in a first grade classroom and the kids (both the boys and the girls) loved it. I think that it is a really cute and funny story and since all the characters are mice you don't have to worry about any kind of racial implications. Lilly, one of the main characters, has such a strong personality and I feel like first graders can really learn a lot from her. I think that she shows that it's okay to think outside the box and just because you are female you don't have to be this quiet, proper being, you can be free and out there. It's a really fun book and I encourge parents and teachers to read it to young ones."
5,My Eye,"When I read this book it made me reminisce about my friend and me. We do everything together.When Lilly moved in, it was bad for Chester and Wilson to not like her. Then it was nice of her to help them out when they were in a predicament."
4,"Henkes dazzles us with his characters, and fun situations!","With a style of writing that children adore and understand, and illustrations that capture wandering eyes, Kevin Henkes portrays a very real situation that children can relate to. The loveable characters and an histerically-cute chain of events, this book is a favorite to all who discover it."
3,Chester's Way Book Review,"In Chester's Way Kevin Henkes teaches us to introduce yourself to new people. Chester and Wilson are friends and they learn that even though Lilly does dangerous things, they can still be friends with her because you never know what might happen. Chester and Wilson were ""practicing hand signals"" when some older boys rode by ""popping wheelies"" and being mean. When Chester and Wilson were sad, a ""fierce looking cat"" jumped out of the bushes and scared the older boys away and that's how Chester and Wilson and Lilly became friends. I learned that you can be friends with different people because you never know when you will need them...Daniel H."
5,Opening/Closing Credit Songs,"If you love the opening and closing credit music of Naruto, then this CD is what you are looking for. You should also check out the Best Hits Collection V.2 (Version 2)."
2,"Some useful info, but overall not very good","The weapon lists (complete with hidden stat/combat effects) are handy. The armor - not quite as much. The rings/accessories? Seriously lacking!There are no maps at all, which is a huge letdown for a guide like this, especially one with over 250 pages. They could have saved most of those pages by condensing most of the item lists into concise tables instead of wasting so much space and spreading the information out so much.One more word of warning: There is at least one instance where the guide instructs you to take a certain action which causes you to skip large segments of dialog and plot (and possibly costs you experience as well), and doesn't even tell you that you're missing anything."
4,"Satirical autobiography: often great, but occasionally lost","Marcia Aldrich provides a series of essay of what it was like growing up female in the fifties. Marcia fails to fit the image of the perfect female as defined by her mother and apparently society. Females kept a home clean as they wore their pink outfits. Marcia was a rebel with a cause as she failed at every essence of traditional feminism as defined in the fifties.GIRL REARING is a coulda book that never decides whether it is a satirical autobiography or a disconcerting attempt to shake up the world with a philosophical primal scream. When the essays are introspective, the reader has a gem of a book. When the essays attempt to nuke the universe, the book loses sight of its objective. Overall, Marcia Aldrich demonstrates writing talent that make her memoirs an interesting read.Harriet Klausner"
5,Great For Your Home Files,I am obsessed with organizing everything and these file folders help me keep my paperwork filing very simple. The price was great and they arrived very quickly.
1,These don't work at all!,"These are HORRIBLE. They don't fit into any other ""end caps"" that go on either end of the extenders... and both my husband and I tried several brands of end pieces! The problem is that the threads on any of these (no matter the length of extender you choose) don't go down far enough to accept the screw that goes into it. Therefore, you're stuck with an area that is nothing but threads outside of the extender that your pages get caught on. Cheap for a reason. I'm really surprised Pioneer has such a hack product."
4,Pins solve the problem,I used 12 of the pins to secure a bed ruffle. I put pieces of felt on the box spring first to help prevent the pins from tearing the fabric. We then turned the mattress end-for-end and the bed ruffle stayed in position perfectly. There are enough pins to do another bed. I give them 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the price - $8 is ridiculous for a box of pins.
5,Quick fix,"Nice and Easy, I love how simple is to use them and secure the bed skirt just around the frame."
3,Twist pins,Not easy to use. Does hold dust ruffle in place. Some of the pins break. Would not recommend to others
5,The best I've found.,"Being new to golf, I read many books and purchased many videos. This book has been the most helpful by far. Over Jim McClain, Bobby Jones, Ledbetter etc. It truly communicates what you need to feel. Learning mechanics is one thing, but until you FEEL it, you won't progress. Personally, my iron shots now are great! From just one pointer in the book and it is now hard not to hit my irons straight. Great book. Great teachers."
5,Great - finally puts the body parts in the proper order,"After many lessons and lots of soul searching and bad adjustments made to my swing, this book really sets out the priorities of what makes a good swing. I supposedly swing outside in and have a slice. I have tried to use my legs, swing inside out with the clock method, swing slower, have a stronger grip, etc., etc. In frustration I locked my wrists and could manage a 23 handicap with mainly shoulder action. Finally this book tells how the hands lead, then the arms and the shoulders only follow. I also concentrated on a good follow through, but now know that it will be better when every thing else gets in the right order. Now that I have concentrated just on the hands for a while without any other movement, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Hitting is a lot easier on the body and when I do get things right it goes pretty far! Hooray."
5,Great Golf Instructional Book!,A great golf instructional book! I think it would be especially helpful to the beginner. The book was written in a very logical sequence and in the order of importance to help reader understand the entire golf swing. Drills in each chapter were simple to perform and effective.
5,"If I had to pick one golf book, it would be this one.","""Just"" the basics. This book will allow you to ""feel"" what is good or bad about each shot that you make. This is important because knowing what you have done right or wrong is half the battle in learning golf. I also like this book because there is a lot you can learn about your swing without even having to hold a club...you can develop your ""feel"" just waiting for the bus"
2,Don't full me...,I read it more one time and I feel that it's incomplete to learn the swing. Perhaps it's a book to read with a professional.
4,Excellent resource for anyone working in performing arts,"Written in a breezy, easy-to-understand style, this book is a must for anyone--actor or otherwise--who works in the performing arts field. The author understands the unique nature of their jobs and how it relates to taxes, deductions, etc. It will save you money in the long run. The only problem I have is that it only comes out every two years."
5,Tax information for Performers,"A snappy read for the perfect solutions for taxes, which are often confusing,in the business of entertaining. Self-employment info when the need is great ,and you want to know what's going on instead of trusting others to handle your money."
1,"NOT AS PICTURED, NOT 16 INCHES & NOT ACCURATE!","DESERVES ZERO STARS! Don't waste your money, it's not even 12 inches, the map is wrong and there are only three colors on it!! These were to be hung in the library, so....having an accurate map of the world is kind of important."
4,Educational toy,Great and thrifty way to teach geography. Can't beat the price. My 5 year old daughter lives it. I recommend this.
4,Inflatable Globe,"I bought this for my three year old son because he loves playing with balls. This is a great indoor ball. It also is great to teach about how seasons occur (using a flashlight as the sun) and the seas, continents, oceans, etc.It is easy to inflate and has lasted through many playdates."
2,It is not what it looks like,"The globe does not look like what is shown in the picture. The colors are dark purple,brown and green--highly unattractive for a kid to play with.D"
5,Excellent,The item arrived just in time. You can see clearly the names for each country and it is a very good educational toy.
1,colors are not exact,I did rate this product - which is 0. the color is a brownish tone. I thought it would be a more pinkish tone. I would never buy this product again and I cannot be bothered to package it up and send it back
3,Important historical text on radiative transfer,"This book is considered one of the standard books on the subject. It was out of print for many years and I could not locate a used copy. I finally bought it when it came back in print as a Dover publication.It is a very difficult book to work through. I am not a big fan of PN and SN type methods since I belong to the Monte Carlo form of transport religion. The book will not be particularly useful in writing computer code; it focuses on theory. However, it is still worth the buying considering the low cost."
4,A thoughtful book from a great teacher,"I had the great pleasure of taking Prof. Griffith's seminar in Colonial literature during graduate school at Bucknell, and this book was part of the required reading. It is a highly insightful and theoretical look at the literature of colonialism and its impact on the colonized 'other.' Highly recommended!"
4,All Breaks No Vocals,I bought this off Itunes a few months ago. Not a bad album but not GREAT either. I am a huge ICEY fan which I think this album is more directed too. If your looking for some great VOCAL Breaks this is not for you. I still give it 4 stars since it has some great beats. If you can get it for 9.99 or less I would get it.
2,Not one of my favorites,I listened to this CD once or twice and I find it boring. I prefer his CD's that have more full-length vocals and this one does not have many of them. I'm tempted to put this one up for sale again.
3,"Not as compelling as the flowers of evil, but still has its moments","I think I prefer the flowers of evil, but Baudilaire's attempt to create a poetic prose with these short pieces is still full of lots of fun. He's a cynical provocateur par excellence, and unlike Nietzsche, he doesn't get all bogged down by his own ideas. It made me want to wander around the streets of 19th century Paris and stalk doughy faced, down-on-their-luck peasants all day."
5,Paris Spleen Book,"I used this book my freshmen year of college in an English class. It was very interesting and insightful. Although the read is very hard to understand because of the language, if your are able to take the time to really think about the messages and look up the meanings of the really hard ones, you will find that it makes a lot of sense. I liked and thought it made me step out of my normal realm of thinking."
4,45mm Hybrid fenders,"I knocked a star off because they don't list the fender width. I figured that ""Fits 700C Road"" meant that it would fit my 700C bike, but they are 10mm too wide.Nice sturdy fenders though..."
1,Don't Bother,"I purchased this gate when my daughter was crawling. I wouldn't use this gate to keep a dog safe, never mind a child! Also, guests can never figure out how to get it open the right way. It is easier to just pull it open as a toddler would do, rather than correctly try to pull the tab up to open it. It never truely ""locks or latches"", any toddler can just pull it open. It often closes enough to look locked shut, then my daughter will walk by and pull it open with one hand. It does not latch shut is any way, it is sort of a magnetic lock. Really not a safe gate, especially for stairs and WAY too expensive. I thought the ""Eddie Buauer"" name and the price would ensure quality, it does not. I would purchase the Evenflo Top of Stair Gate instead. It is half the price, much better quality and you can use it in any doorway (not just stairs). Eddie Bauer's Gate is an accident waiting to happen!"
4,Nice wood gate but installation may require special parts,"I bought two of these gates. Once installed they look nice, are quite sturdy and relatively easy to operate. However, they made assumptions about the installation that will require some custom work and parts. For example, if you have baseboard on both sides of the stairway or a round knewel post, it will require that you make a custom mount. I had to buy washers to mount to the knewel post and a custom cut piece of wood (a difficult cut because of the thickness) to mount the other one."
1,I hate this gate,"We made the mistake of buying this gate for the bottom of our stairs because 1) it caters to wider areas than the standard gates, 2) it appeared sturdy , 3) it looks nice. But its just the most awkward gate ever to open/close. You have to lift the very small lever out & up, then pull the gate out while still holding onto the lever. Impossible while holding a child and still takes multiple tries even without. Even to close it you have to push it twice to click both top & bottom pieces into place. We have a Safety One gate at the top of the stairs which is literally a 1 step handle to open/close. Definitely returning this product, especially considering the price & the fact that i am having to climb over it every time i want to get in/out which defeats the purpose of a gate. Hope this helps."
2,Hard to use,"Not easy to install: template for screw holes was way off and the latch plate comes off the wall easily. If installed right, it is sturdy and it looks really nice, but it is really hard to use. Needs two hands to open and really has to slam shut."
3,Good gate cheap hardware,"We installed this gate at the top of the stairs, and really liked it until it broke. The plastic ""hinges"" have cracked and broken. We are hoping to find replacement parts, since this is the only gate that we have found that fits in our stairway. We do not want to pay another $100 for a new gate. I would suggest that if you want to buy this gate, get it at a store that will sell you an extended warranty, so when/if it breaks they will replace the gate."
3,Deliberate Schubert,"I have to agree with the Gramophone review, only perhaps with greater emphasis. Compared with Brendel et al. (Philips) (and also with the excellent Peter Serkin et al. (Vanguard); not to mention Rudolf Serkin et al. (Sony) who are also pretty good), this is a pedestrian, plodding rendition of the Trout Quintet."
3,Works great while it lasts,"I have used this for the past 7 months in South Florida. I like the neat, clean look of carrying all of my cords inside and have the velcro carrying it across on one of the docklines. Problem is, it's not cheap and now after 7 months it has completely deteriorated to the point where it is split in many areas and has to be replaced. I will probably pony up another $50 for another but wish there was a longer-lasting product or a lower price point."
4,Works fine but confusion in quantity description,"Ordered these as they seemed to be a good price for a two-pack so we ordered 2 (for a total of 4 cartridges). However, we only recieved 2 cartridges. I emailed company and they shipped two additional cartridges out. While the service was fine, I had asked in the email about the product description but the company did not answer. There is a discrepancy. ""Part Number RS3-DS12-05 Item Package Quantity 1"" and lower it states ""RS3-DS12-05 Features: -Set of two replacement cartridges.""-I am still confused as to where the error was.. the product description or in shipping. If the price is for one, it is more expensive than locally."
4,"Not a particularly cool product, but a good price","Water filters? We have a couple of whole house filters with cartridges that need replacing about every three months. We use different filter cartridges in each. This is one of them. Our water tastes good. I used to buy these at places like Home Depot, but Amazon beats the prices, especially if you buy enough stuff to get free shipping. If you need to add to your total to get the free ship, check these out:A Call to Arms! Out of the Pews and Into the StreetsProstitutes, Tax Collectors, and You"
2,odd smell,"The pillow actually had an odd smell to it, like plastic or something. Tried to air it out outside, but it didn't help. Also tried putting it in the dryer with a dryer sheet, that didn't help either. Bought this for my 6 year old that loves candy, hershey is her favorite, and loves bead pillows. Another complaint is the pillow was not as full as others I have bought. She doesn't use it and got an angry bird pillow for Christmas that does not smell and is fuller, so she uses that one."
3,good stuff,"Invited me to buy a product is the value of similarities cheap and also the image of the product, but I was expecting to have more quality and weight as well."
1,NOT for a B6 passat!!,I had read on several Passat forums that these would fit a B6. They do not!! They are too big and the inner clamps won't fit on the stock exhaust. Look for the 61-1105 model.
2,"good price, good fit, didn't last long",The tips(2) came and fit right on my 2006 Mazdaspeed 6. One of them fell off the mounting bracket after 2 weeks. Since they're so inexpensive I'm going to buy a replacement for the one that got lost somewhere on the road and I'm going to strengthen the bracket connection by welding a patch. We'll see how long they last.
2,Doesn't fit VW Passat (2007) w/2.0T,"Listed in the Amazon ""Fits Your Car"", or whatever that section is called, for a B6 Passat with the 2.0T engine. Not even close to fitting the factory exhaust pipes. Well made and packaged impressively though."
4,Tip,It worked good and looked good. Car needed a little change so it did it so I was happy and didnt spend much so its a win
5,Great way to add to your car's look,"These are every bit as good as the ones you'll find at your local auto parts, but they are at a reduced price. The tip consists of an inner clamp that is positioned/installed and then the chrome outer shell is attached to it with two small screws. The clamp is mid-range inside the shell so you will need at least 3"" of exhaust pipe to attach it to, in case you're trying to butt it up against your muffler. The chrome outer shell is oval so your existing pipe needs to be close to no more than 2"" or the inner clamp will be too expanded and difficult to slide the outer chrome sleeve over. I installed two of these on my 2004 Accord V-6 with 2"" existing exhaust and it was a close fit but looks great and I'm very happy with them. Air flow through the gap between the clamp and the chrome shell seems to be keeping the tips from discoloring also.I'd recommend them to anyone with a 2"" exhaust system."
3,Could be better designed.,"The clamping system for this is a joke, I wanted to attach this directly to a muffler with a 2 inch outlet, since the muffler is designed to fit OVER a 2 inch pipe it was slightly bigger causing the clamping system to be too small. The clamping system in the tip is very unforgiving. It looks like one of those conduit clamps made to attach to a wall and hold a piece of metal conduit. I ended up cutting two slots on the underside then fed a stainless steel hose clamp through the slots so it would clamp onto the pipe, worked like a charm and only took a few seconds to put on the car. Looks good too."
4,not too fond of the color,"It fits perfectly on my Jackson Roll. As stated there is no zip to close it, it's like a sham in that the back of the pillowcase overlaps on itself. Wish it came in other colors though."
1,Misleading Product Description,"I ordered this product believing that it was sold in boxes of 100 sheets. I received a box of 50. I contacted the company by phone and sent a copy of this Amazon advertisement. No response. So, buyer beware!"
2,Least Essential D.I. Release,"If you're looking for a worthwhile final dying gasp from this most remarkable band, then you will very likely be disappointed with this CD. The terrific, but impossible to find Technicolour was a much more fitting exit point, leaving this release seeming like so much boring, unfinished filler that should have been left unheard.This is for diehard fans only, and even they will consider it disposable."
3,Big Circo,"This CD is not what I expected. If your are looking for some new Tejano music then you have found it but if you are looking for something along the lines of Kumbia Kings type of songs then this is not it, try again. The cumbia's on this CD are good to listen to but I didn't care for the baladas."
1,Okay but not really good,I was disappointed when the box of choclate arrived. The foil that wraps the cigar doesn't quite cover everything at the bottom and shows the cholocate. The wrapping blue tin foil looks very cheap. I would not recommend it.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book while researching resources for a class I will be teaching for a group of ministerial students on Balance and Vitality in the MInistry. The work sounded intriguing and I began reading it the day it arrived. But although the premise is interesting, I didn't feel the author really deleved into what he promised. The book left me with the feeling that ministers need to be aware of the dangers of burnout, without offering any real solutions or preventative skills to build. (We're already aware of this, I think.) The section on the Inneagram was sketchy and more anecdotal than helpful in describing the types in terms of ministry, their strong suits, and their weaknesses. It was a few paragraphs to a couple pages for each, pretty much listing the above. Clearly the author feels it's a time for healing. (I agree with him.) But once he makes this point he doesn't offer what I was looking for in the way of addressing the problem preventatively."
3,"Not bad, but...","While this book is alright, I must admit... isn't there enough Wicca 101 type books out there??? Llewellyn Worldwide seems to be stuck in a rut! For the past 10 years they have done nothing but publish ""Witchcraft for the beginner type books."" What about the intermediate and advanced practitioners out here? What about us who've been practicing the arts for more than 25 years? While Kala's book is alright (it's not the best newbie book, by far) I think that there needs to be a little more attention to detail and a little less hype. There is a wider target audience than the beginner neophytes out here!"
4,exercise in a pinch,"A very unique, inexpensive piece of exercise equipment. I love this disc as it does not take up a lot of space, it's quiet, inexpensive and low volume impact. I can travel with it and exercise anywhwere, anytime I want. It is so convenient."
4,Great for a skating spin trainer,"I got a tip to try this instead of the more expensive spin trainers that are used to improve spins in figure skating. While I've never tried the more expensive ones made specifically to practice spinning, this one seems to do the trick. It helps me get the feel of spinning around quickly, which should help me feel less dizzy when I try to spin on the ice. For the price, it's worth a shot."
2,the twist board is small,"This thing is so small do NOT bother. I wear a 7.5 women's shoe, and my toes are almost hanging off."
1,Waste of money,I do not recommend this product if you are looking to lose weight or tone up. You can stand and twist and work the same muscles as you can with this. Very disappointed.
1,UNSTABLE ITEM.,I found this item very small and very unstable to be used as exersize equipment.I returned it for a refund and sought another form of equipment..
5,Makes work a workout!,I bought this when I converted to a standing desk at work.In less than a month I have really seen and felt the results. This works your back and side muscles. Its flattened my stomach. After years of sitting at work this is helping me recover better form. Can't wait to see the final results a few months more down the road.
4,"Nifty little device, for the price :)","I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend a few days ago, so I haven't had it for very long, but so far I am happy with it. I had read a previous review that suggested it might be a little small, and I may need two; one for each foot. After trying it out I realize that one is just fine. I am 5' 5"" and 195 lbs so I'm not a very small person, but I still had no trouble fitting both feet on at once. The construction seems pretty sturdy and it spins nice and smooth, even with all my weight on it. I wanted it more to help stretch my back than for actual exercise, but after using it I'm kinda thinking it's a good way to practice balance, in addition to working my abs. (And yes it does make my back feel good too!)"
3,doesnt feel too reliable,"feels like one of those ""As Seen On TV"" products but it does what it says it does and it was not a terrible price. i'm thinking if i can make myself use it, it could not hurt me anyway."
4,cool stuff,"I had this on my wish list, and Im not sure who bought and sent it to me!? Thanks!Out of the box, I was concerned that it was a little flimsy. Ii could lose 10lbs, but I'm looking to just trim a bit... but this is like two frisbees with casters, or rollers between them. (Think of your microwave's turntable.) But it works.I stepped on it and twisted a handful of times, and I was sore in my solar plexus. I tried a few minutes later, thinking that if I squat down that surely that would get rid of the sore feeling up higher. Ha! nope... got a hip/thigh work out though. The trick is to not forget to squeeze your lower abs while twisting."
3,Twist Board,This item shipped fast and arrived in excellent condition. It doesn't seem like it's that study. I'm 150 lbs and I have a hard time keeping it from sliding to the sides. The first one was by Bally Fitness and was better.
2,why did i buy this thing?,it was fun to use at first. but i quickly forgot about its existence. it was better for me just to sign up for classes at the gym.
3,Small board,"You can get a good twisting motion with this board for your waist. It is a fun and easy to travel with workout. However, the board itself is a bit small for a larger person. Unless you have cat-like balance and yoga poses, it is hard to put both feet on this board.I suppose it makes for a better exercise. Flexing and working all your muscles to support yourself. Someone needs to make a board with a larger base."
4,"excellent, small, portable aerobic exercise device","I must do aerobic exercises daily, but since I live in a studio apartment, there is no room for aerobic equipment. Fast walking is great when the weather is good, but bad weather and traveling hobble my exercise efforts.This little device is excellent and I've recommended it to friends. I recently brought it on a 3 day trip and was able to exercise several times daily without interrupting the flow of events. I wish I could bring it to the office with me! It's really easy to use anywhere.I get my heart rate up to 125, which isn't super high, but does the trick. Note that I ordered a different make with a wider diameter from another company as I think more foot room would increase comfort and speed. That said, I'm very satisfied with this product and use it daily, which has been especially helpful as I'm recovering from a hip injury."
4,Excellent for a small person,"As many other reviewers stated, this product is very good value. Very smooth and quiet. Caveat: My feet are size 6. Can't imagine someone with feet bigger than size 7 using this. Good exercise, tones abdominal area."
1,Duralast? More like lasted a DAY,"I bought this board to help me lose weight and tone up. There is no max weight limit for using this product and I was happy to do just that... unfortunately it broke while in use the second day I had it. I was using it properly, I wasn't doing anything crazy or beyond what it's *meant* to be used for, and yet it's nothing more than an oversize paper weight now. To say that I'm disappointed would be an understatement, and I have no interest in paying more in shipping and handling to get a replacement than what I paid for the thing originally by making use of the ""warranty"".My advice? Skip this, and find something more durable."
5,Everlast Twist Board,"For such a small piece of equipment you get a great workout and lose inches. I use mine while watching or listening to a program. I've noticed my waist, hips and thighs starting to tone up. I highly recommend this product and Amazon."
4,"a little small, thin plastic, but fun","I love my twist board. I use it multiple times a week and enjoy having home exercise equipment that small enough to stow away, quiet during use, and easy to use while watching TV or reading on my Kindle. It took a bit of time to figure out where to place my feet, and the plastic does seem a little thin for the intended use of the board. I frequently hear it shifting and cracking under my feet when I step on, and I'm always worried it will break. Given the price, though, I'm not too worried about having to buy a replacement if needed."
4,So far so good,I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it seems working. It's nice and small and possible to store easily anywhere.
4,Fun and Easy,"I might not feel like I am getting much of a workout, I don't get out of breath or very sweaty, but it is fun and easy to use and gets me off the couch. :-)"
3,"Basic, Cheaply Made","The twist board works, but isn't really what I'd call heavy duty. It's very light and the Everlast sticker on mine was peeling off and bubbly.I'm also about 130 lbs with size 5 feet and you could heard bits of the plastic edges of the two ""plates"" that make up the back and front sides rubbing against each other about 70% of the time. They don't do it if I'm perfectly centered, but that's sort of difficult since the board is pretty small.It's fun, but I keep feeling like I'm gonna twist and crack it one of these days."
2,"too bad, but it just doesn't last","I bought this item, but had to return it because it broke the first time I did more than take a 30 second spin on it. Instead I bought this one:GSI Quality Electronic Figure Trimmer Balance Musical Twist Board - LCD Screen Displays Count Of Twists, Time, Fat And Calories Burned - For Diet, Weight Loss And Keeping FitThe GSI was much better and I recommend it. See my review of that product."
2,Balance Problems,"I don't really care for this product. I feel it should have a much larger platform to stand on for the exercise it is designed to do. It is smaller than I imagined and hard to stay on it as you try twisting. I wish I had known how small it was before I bought it. I am not large, wear only a size 7 shoe in fact and although I do this barefoot, I do not feel it is comfortable enough to stand on or very safe either. It is easier if you stand by a wall or use something to hold onto as you twist as it is easy to fall off of it. Holding onto something helps you stay on it. Balance can be a big issue for this product. It is not a recommendation of mine."
3,Too small for adult,"My shoes size is size 9, and this twist board is just enough, sometimes I feel too small, not comfortable to stand on it. My husband want to use it but it's way too small for him to step on it!"
3,Twist Board,I would have like this product more if the surface area for footing would have been a little bigger. Only used a few times but seems to work OK.
5,An informative and candid look at growing up in Korea,"My Treacherous Journey: Guided By The Wisdom Of A Korean Mother is the life story of Kyung Soon Yun, a survivor of war, poverty, and the loss of her mother. Fulfilling her mother's final wish (to write her life story) Kyung Soon Yun candidly recounts the ups and downs of her life, including her marriage and children, and subsequent departure America. Her life after reaching American soil is the planned subject of the next volume of her autobiography. My Treacherous Journey is, by and large, an informative and candid look at growing up in Korea despite the devastating effects of the Korean War and its aftermath. Highly recommended reading for students of 20th Century Korean history as well as a compelling and memorable personal story."
2,Review,Interesting story but writer needed editing help. Got bored many times due to the redundancy of the material and the story line. I believe she is going to write a follow up book. Hopefully next time she will get assistance. LS
5,A documentation of family and courage,"The author, an innocent eight year old, observes the history and lasting effects of the Korean War on its people, revealing its impact on Korea's poorest and on the psyche of its children in My Treacherous Journey. Soon's mother, dying, wished her tenyearold daughter to raise her three-year-old brother and to keep a diary of her life struggles: this powerful biography is filled with insights and a documentation of family and courage."
2,Not Quiet,"Some reviews and specs say this gun is quiet or more quiet than others. This is not the case, it is just as loud as other heat guns."
2,White Washed,"Playback is White Washed Through Most of the Film. It is watchable if you are willing, but if not this would be difficult to get through.Avoid this version."
5,New Civil War Era Hero,"Union Army Captain Joe Monroe, finding himself a fugitive falsely accused and then captured and imprisoned, will be tagged by the voracious media with the undeserved name of ""Bloody"" Joe. His efforts to exonerate himself, along with those of the few who believe in his innocence, bring him into contact with a fascinating assortment of crooked politicians and military men, loyal family, supportive civilians and bloodthirsty manhunters, as well as figures of national historical significance. The author's attention to detail and historical accuracy combined with a well-thought-out plot, believable characters and a satisfying ending will appeal to Civil War buffs and adventure readers as well, leaving readers eagerly awaiting a sequel."
3,It's All About Culture!,"Cameron and Quinn do an excellent job of laying out how to diagnoise and change organizational culture. Importantly, they also provide methods and rationale on measuring culture given the competing values framework. One dissapointment was that the authors did not update the performance of many companies discussed in the 3rd edition. However, overall I am pleased with this scholarly publication that explains organizational culture in detail."
3,Good enough but...,But many pieces included were only excerpts from longer pieces. I prefer complete selections. It is easier to listen the soprano than to watch her.
4,Family time,We have truly enjoyed it. The rugrats go wild is our favorite. My husband and our grandchildren could spend hours watching
5,i love rugrats,Rugrats is my favorite show it brings back great memories... I grew in the 90's so this was the best of the best when I was little. I love all the movies and just love rugrats in general :D
5,Great DVD for kids,I love this DVD! I bought this for my kids in Children's Church! The kids are able to learn the songs from reading the captions. This DVD is a wonderful tool to use to get kids excited about Praise & Worship!
1,Phil's Online Poker Secrets STINK!,"This is probably the worst instructional poker DVD I have ever seen. It's only about 35 minutes long and all he talks about are the acronyms used while playing online (i.e. ROTFLMAO = roll on the floor laughing my a** off) and really not much else. If you have his other 2 DVDs from the same series, don't waste your money on this one. It's not worth it."
2,No value - But kind of entertaining,"When I watched this DVD I really had to laugh. I find it kind of amusing how Hellmuth could release such a DVD. It absolutly has no value if you're looking for an instructional DVD. You ""learn"" things like ""LOL"" means laugh out loud, or that the advantages of online play are that you can play whenever you want, you can multitable or listen to the radio while you're playing.And of course this wouldn't be a Hellmuth DVD if he didn't tell us how a great pokerplayer he is.The only reason I give this DVD 2 stars instead of one is, because I find it kind of entertaining. I like listening to this guy and his storys, I really have to laugh about how he is promoting himself.But if you're no big fan of Hellmuth, don't get fooled to buy this dvd.. it has no valuable information - not even for absolute beginners."
1,Million Dollar Secrets!? How about Two Dollar Secrets,Phil could offer so much. Instead all we get is his self-promotion.
1,Rutherford,"I was less than impressed. It was flimsy and felt broken the minute I used it. It served its purpose, but I would not buy it again."
1,"wrong product, returned for full refund Thanks Amazon!","This was advertised as the transformer for the slide viewer I ordered. Well, Amazon messed up on this. It was a total mismatch. Amazon did refund my money and they were very professional about it."
1,Over priced & not needed !!!!!,Price almost tripled when bill came.This is not needed with the camera scanner. Power comes through the computer connection.
4,Everlast for Her Wobble Board,"I bought the wobble board because I used one like it in physical therapy. For foot and leg exercises, it is great. I also tried some of the exercises on the leaflet that came with the wobble board. The exercises were challenging and fun.It is difficult to do the exercises which require sitting on the wobble board due to the bumps."
2,Not a great workout item.,"The product isn't a good workout method at all, the one with the ball underneath is better.This is just a knock off brand, I'm returning as i text."
3,Wobble board,"Not a bad value, inexpensive. Not very difficult or challenging to use (for a normal person) but it is what it looks like and is a nice starter for balance."
5,Vocal Genius,"Not only does Jonell possess one of the most incredible voices on the planet, she also brings an intelligence and art to her music that I have never witnessed. I was fortunate enough to hear/see her perform recently in Dallas. Wow! I was weak all over. Awesome!"
1,Ridiculous revenge fantasy,"This appears to be an excuse to depict as many gross-out forms of shooting and stabbing human beings as is possible in 75 minutes. Dead bodies pile up in Rockaway NY but no cops seem to exist in this silly pulp action film with no plot other than a march to the death by an Afgahanistan vet bent on avenging his girlfriend's stabbing. He gets his eyeballs poked out with a sharp knife by one of the many bad guys, but barely bleeds, manages to walk away and then, later, to singlehandedly shoot everyone else dead while blind! Great concept. Do not waste your time on this unless you like watching unrealistic scenes of bullets blasting huge chunks of human flesh."
1,Rockaway,"Real poor quality acting, if you like a boring story with no plot then this is the one for you."
5,Women's Bible Study Guide,"This is not a book to read thru. It is a study guide for women. It applies to both the single and married. It is practical truths that never are outdated. I like it because it gives me scripture to look up and then asks questions with a place to respond. I have not finished this book, but enjoy it."
3,An up-to-date book on strategic management,"This book was the text for my strategic management class, and it was one of my favorite textbooks. The authors of this book tried to explain the concepts of strategic management. The case studies were very interesting, and the book gave insight into successes and failures of some companies. It may be wordy, but it's packed with useful information and analysis."
4,Astoundingly Beautiful!!!,"I gave it 4 star because the bracelet/watch band is really flimsy.I love it so much that I can't stop looking at it. Considering the cost, it looks like something far more expensive - someone guessed $1800. It looks way better than the pictures (elegant, expensive and stylish). The blue color is vivid and deep enough not to look cheap, and both the bezel and dial change colors when lights hit the watch at different angles.For 24 hours, it didn't lose even a second.A minor things:0. Flimsy watch band1. I really wish it came with a sapphire crystal window even I had to pay $100 more. :-(2. It's slightly small to my taste but that's a personal thing.3. The bracelet is very long. Not a fault but if you don't have the tools, take it to a jeweler.4. The bezel is very hard to turn. It may even break your nail because you have to dig in hard."
3,I am happy but not wowed!,"There are no major problems with the watch and it looks nice but it is not close to the glowing descriptions given by others. Setting the date, is not difficult, but coordinating the date with the correct day of the week is something I have yet to accomplish though I have had the watch several weeks. It is not like this is something I work on daily but I read the instructions when I first got the watch and don't remember anything clear about this. Additionally, I do not need to know the Spanish days, which are included.Would I recommend the watch, yes. Brag about it, no. Does it look like a more expensive watch, maybe. Does it perform like one, no."
4,Bulova is a quility watch with a good warrenty.,I liked the quility of the watch and the price the blue face and that it is a dive watch.
2,Not worth the money...,Bulova was once the watch I always bought but after 7 months of wearing this Marine star watch the seal broke and water started seeping in. I ended up spending 300 dollars on a Citizen and really love it.
2,Very disappointed,When I saw this watch I fell on love with it because I love diver's with blue faces. But when I actually got the watch it took an act of congress to turn the bezel and I use it a lot and the other thing was the second hand would not line up with the markers and I've never seen a quartz watch that was 20 seconds a day fast. If those things don't bother you than this is the watch for you but I returned mine and I bought an invicta automatic pro diver signature series and I am very pleased with it
2,Looks good but its movement is off.,"This is a nice looking diver watch. In my opinion, this is one of the best looking blue dial diver watches found on Amazon besides the more expensive options. However, the movement is subpar. This watch is off by 1/2 of a second. I have bought cheaper watches with better time than this one. *If anyone who has bought this watch believes that I might have gotten a dud , please leave a comment so I may return it for a replacement.* Thanx."
4,"Gorgeous, dependable watch","This watch is very good looking, has a very nice weighty feel and keeps time very precisely. So why four stars? Well, it is $150 and not an Omega. I compared it to an Omega in a store and the fine work on the Omega really does show that $2000 means something. For instance, teh bezel does not move very easily or precisely on the Bulova as it does on the Omega. But this is a very, very good deal and I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Bulova Paper Weight,"I purchase a Bulova Harley watch 76B02 and my complaint is not the watch but the lack of not being able to purchase a replacement watchband. This is a very special band that fits around the watch and is not available. How can such a great watch maker not have replacement watchband for the items sold. Not I'm stuck with a bulova watch paper weight.Thanks,Joe"
5,Really nice watch!,"I've had this watch for about a month now and am very happy with it. Not much to add since most of the other reviews have it right. The blue dial is a little darker than the picture. A lot of people mentioned the bracelet being huge. This is correct and a little disappointing since you take it out of the box and can't use it right away unless you know how to remove links. I went to my local mall for this. To give you an idea, I'm a pretty big guy and they had to remove 4 links for a perfect fit. I also like its heavy feel. Setting the day and date isn't hard if you follow the instructions. I especially like the screw down crown that insures no water getting in. I've always been a Seiko customer and this is my first Bulova. I recommend this watch and would buy another one."
2,Not a quality watch.,"I purchased this watch several years ago. It never kept good time. It would loss about 40 minutes a week. Bulova replaced the movement, and the watch is better. It now gains about 20 minutes every 3 days. This watch also eats batteries: I had to replace the battery every 7 or eight months. Replaced the battery 4 times already. It's a beautiful watch and it looks like the Omega. This brand has some real issues with quality control.A watch has one job: To tell time. I gave Bulova two chances. I guess I'm beat for the money I spent. There are many watches in this price range; you may want to consider them."
3,Chinese-made watch,"Bigger and thicker than advertised. I'm totally sick and tired of THICK watches. There's no reason for it in this day and age. It doesn't matter than it's a 200m watch, they can still be made to fit a wrist and not take out every door-frame in sight. Jeez. Movement is cheap, Chinese. Plastic movement ring. Nice looking watch, but just made to last until any warranty is over."
1,Watch quality not as promised...,Water resistant to 200m?! Yeah right!!!!!!!!!! The deepest this watch ever went with me was 7' (2.1m). It leaked and was ruined. Not a happy camper.
4,Bulova 98c62 Marine Star,"Bought this after it went on sale for about a week at 135 - had to wait several months for the price drop. Rotating bezel is a little stiff at first, but it loosens up with a few rotations and a drop of oil. Keeps within 1-3 seconds per month. Size should satisfy large and small wrists alike, and styling is among best in it's price class. Have had it about three months or so, and am satisfied. Would not want to pay mall prices for it."
5,Best Diver's Watch,"I have owned this watch for about six months and have worn it every day since my purchase. It is by far the best watch among the sea of watches out there, and, hands down, the best I've ever owned, and I have owned a TAG, Tissot, Rolex and Cartier. In terms of function and aesthetics, it is better than the Rolex Submariner and Omega Seamaster. Trent Preston does a great tribute to this Marine Star here: [...]."
4,Nice watch,Nice everyday watch. Easy to read face and appears to be good quality. No problems at all. A good buy.
4,Nice looking watch,"Watch arrived in approx. one week in good condition. Nice looking watch, heavier than I expected (a good thing). At first I thought the crystal was substandard until I discovered the peel-off clear plastic. Appears to be a mineral crystal. The directions for setting the watch were somewhat confusing but I eventually sorted that out too. Watch band requires sizing since it comes in size Hulk Hogan. No directions for making band shorter, so I went to internet and tried the procedure I found there to no avail. Finally took it to a watch repair shop where the jeweler shortened it while I waited ($15). Keeps better time than my Rolex (but so does my Timex)and is easier to read in daylight and at night. All-in-all a fine buy."
5,Really cute,It is exactly as described. I may have like one larger but it's the size I expected. I hung it in a tree with the planets all around it so when they looked out the spaceship window it looked like they were really in space.
2,Astronaut Needs Air,Astronaut came with a pin sized whole in the seam. I would have returned it but the shipping and handling cost more than the product.I needed it for V.B.S. space theme so I tried to tape it and just kept blowing it up. It was cute when it had air. Just didn't last long.
3,size does matter,"Buyer beware......if you are looking for a 27"" astronaut.......look elsewhere. This is not 27"" as indicated on the product discription. In actuality, it is only 24"". The shipping alone costs more then the product and with the size difference, I would have bought this product elsewhere that sells exactly what they say they will sell. With the cost of everything going up, you would think you can actually get exactly what you order. Sad."
1,HUGELY OVER-PRICED PIECE OF JUNK!,THIS LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP TOY FROM THE DOLLAR STORE AND IT COST $45 WITH SHIPPING...RIDICULOUS!!!
3,fun for bassoon lovers,"Sometimes, even bassoonists need to be a little silly, and this fits the bill!"
3,508 Matias Keyboard,"Keys have a nice touch/feel, but if you accidentally hit the insert and delete keys at the same time, the keyboard locks up and you have to reboot."
2,"dissapointed,nothing there.","after buying red white and blue forever,I was very dissapointed to learn that there was only three songs on the cd,and only one was new.I wouldnt recomend anyone to buy this album unless you want to hear airborn ranger and closer to home again in the short version and acoustic version at that."
3,works but...,"it works as advertised, but the pointy end is actually pretty fat. it didn't fit some of the wrenching points on the lens i was working on. i need a finer product."
5,qualtiy but somewhat delicate spanner wrench,"I purchased this spanner wrench when I was looking for a way to remove a notched ring on part of a old analog tape recorder. In the end, it really did not work well for that need. I did not want to force it in removing the about 1/8 inch thick ring screwed on a shaft about 1 inch in diameter. Nevertheless, I have used the tool for several other jobs since then. It works best on small objects such as watch cases. The two working ends come to very fine points, which works very well for things with small notches such as watch parts, but seems a bit delicate for more heavy duty situations. At the same time, the tool has a very solid feel, and it is pretty easy to adjust the spacing. For its intended use on small parts, I highly recommend it. I have even been tempted to try it on somewhat bigger tasks, and it has held up very well."
1,received wrong size,"The product itself, other than its size, was fine, but it wasn't the size advertised, and was completely non-workable for my purpose. I was further dissatisfied with the return process. I was told I could handle that through a local store, which I did. But the exchange ended by costing me more money than it was worth. In the end I did finally get the advertised product, but at a far greater cost than was advertised. A totally bad experience.RegardsFred James"
5,Great Pins,I love these white pearl head pins because the white pearl heads are large and it is easier to find if you drop one. I highly recommend this product.
3,OK but not tops,"Pins are not strong enough and bend too easily with pressure. I am still looking for the quality of steel pins that used to be sold and were easily found in stores 20 years ago. Nonetheless, these pins are good compared to what one can find on the market today but not top quality for sure."
5,Holly Hobbie is a hit!,My three year old daughter absolutely loves Holly Hobbie and Friends. This DVD has such a sweet message about helping a family out that has lost a Father and Husband. This is truly a Holiday must have!
5,Holly Hobbie is a great,My granddaughter has watched this movie many times. Even when it isn't christmas. I think all young kids should watch this movie. It teaches them all about helping other people and sharing. It's a really great movie.
3,"Goldman is amazing, but where is she?","First, note that this documentary is available in widescreen dvd, from the PBS store. I don't know why amazon isn't carrying it.America Experience is a little too sappy for Emma Goldman. She was an incredibly influential pioneer & political philosopher, and a brilliant american orator. Yet this film hangs around her personal story a bit too long. It is an amazing story, but she would have found the emphasis frustrating, I believe. It's the issues that are important here.The only inaccuracy is ... her voice. She sported a radio voice, with an american accent -- very authoritative. For some reason, they used an actress with an eastern european accent to read her writings aloud. This isn't right.Highly recommend her autobiography, which can really make your head spin. Or even ""Reds"", where Maureen Stapleton won an oscar for playing Emma, quite well. The movie is a little melodramatic, but interesting."
2,Did not work,"I received the Pana-Vue #1, made sure the batteries were inserted correctly, then put in a slide. Nothing. Put the batteries in another device to make sure the batteries were okay. Put the bulb in a flashlight to make sure the bulb was okay. Everything checked out, but I could not get this thing to work. Then I went to work trying to figure out how this slide viewer got its juice. I was able to discern that a connection was not being made and I bent one of the copper connectors so the existing gap was no longer there. I got it working but, really, this is a VERY poorly made product and the electrical design looks like something out of the early days of electricity. Now that I have it working, the image of the slides is slightly distorted and not bright enough. Don't waste your money."
2,Very flimsy! Overpriced!,"I also had problems with the battery connection on this product. It took my engineer father two hours of playing with the connections and finally jerryrigging it to get the light to come on. Also, the on/off button doesn't stay pressed down to keep the light on. In general, the construction of the unit is just cheap; it's lightweight plastic that I expected to be much heavier. The images look okay in the viewer, but I was surprised that so much of the viewing area is taken up by the border of the slide. If you have old slides at home, there aren't a lot of other options for viewing them. But this product isn't worth more than a cheap flashlight."
3,Slide Viewer,It is exactly what it is a slide viewer. It works and the quality of the viewer is ok. Slides are a thing of the past and thats why it was as expensive as it was to purchase.
1,Pana-Vue slide viewer and transformer.,I used this product about three hours and after that it quit working. I changed the batteries and light and it still does not work. This was a waste of my money and most disappointing.Ed Kiefhaber
3,The back lighting does not work very well.,"The viewer works okay when the back light is functioning properly. However, the electrical connector does not always work well."
3,NOT HAPPY,"I was not pleased with the Item. the electrcal conections are not good. I can make it work by shaking it,After I worked on the conections. It did not work at all when I received the Pan View. I only need it fora few hundered slides then I will pitch the Item."
3,Images distorted,"The images appear slightly distorted in an hour glass shape. The lighting is otherwise good and the batteries last a long time. It has a nice compact size and its easy to load and unload slides. Overall, this viewer is ok for sorting through slides."
3,Functional but Flimsy,"This is a functional but flimsy slide viewer. It does the job, however, vast improvements could be made at little cost. The incandescent bult should be replaced with a high intensity, white LED. Besides using less current, the LED would virtually last forever. In addition, the bi-metal switch that turns on the light is unreliable. The light came on a couple of times by itself, just due to setting the viewer down. A hermetically sealed, momentary contact switch would solve this problem."
3,SS (Sort of Satisfied),"This is a product for viewing slides one at a time. It could work a little better. The light does not go on and off as it was designed to do and to turn off the light you have to remove the batteries and the door to the battery compartment falls off and has to be replaced each time. The switch to turn on the light is flimsy - but what the hey, for the amount I spent I guess I got what it was worth."
4,Panavue,"Product worked as expected. Instructions for installing the batteries was incomplete.there was no diagram to show the correct position of the batteries. Not a big issue, just annoying."
4,I like this slide viewer,"I fortunately had a new ""C"" battery on hand to test the viewer. It worked exactly as I expected and I have been satisfied with its performance. It's simple and easy to use."
3,Pana-Vue Review-,"It does a reasonably decent job for editing purposes, such as culling out those not worthy for copying. The lens unfortunately distorts the edges a bit, but not enough to negate its effectiveness for the intended job. Of course the price can't be beat and due to few moving parts, very little can break."
1,Waste of money,This is a piece of junk. It didn't work properly right out of the box and then fell apart in my hands on 2nd use. Deserves zero stars.
1,Useless Item,Item was COMPLETELY useless. It would have produced similar results and would have been cheaper by using a magnifying glass and an ordinary light source like a lamp. It should not even have been in the market.
1,outdated,"This book has a copyright date of 1995. Some of the information and laws have changed since this book has been written. The scanners that are on the market today did not exist 12 years ago, therefore most of the information on the scanner itself is hopelessly outdated. Other than radio theory which at times can be confusing, this book is a waste of time."
3,Desperately needs an update,"All technology and frequencies referenced are over 15 years old at this point. That's several lifetimes in scanning. For example, trunking and digital transmission are referred to as future technologies! Sadly, as a result, over half of the book is obsolete to the point of being useless.In its day it was deep enough to keep your average hobbyist busy for several years. Were the author to update it this would be one of the best reference manuals around."
2,not what i expected,The book arrives is good condition. But it contains no frequency information like I thought it would. So its pretty useless to me. But thats not the sellers fault...its mine.
1,worthless,book was written in the 90's and a lot of things are out of date. Contains no secret frequencies. I would not recommend this book.
2,Not Good,Title overstates the content of the book. There are no secret frequencies.Title overstates the content of the book. There are no secret frequencies.
3,Kettle,"The product is attractive but doesn't have a very substantial feel to it. Perhaps others would not mind, but the whistle is way too loud. It would wake up a whole household if one didn't get to the kettle as soon as it began whistling."
3,Perfume,Eh it is what it is! Got what I was supposed to I just ordered the wrong thing and tried to cancel it but wasn't allowed !
5,Superb its a nice surprise for some one u love :),"The smell of it makes me mad , This is what i think when i think love .. perfect for the one i loveThanks"
5,Luis rojas,Excelente la mercancíaLlego en buen estadoLlego a tiempo la mercancíaRecomiendo a este compradorEstoy muy contento con mi producto...
5,Essential Reading for Pastors and Church Leaders!,"This was a good book. Easy reading and easy to understand. The book was written to ""alert"" pastors about ""well-intentioned saint"" who pose problems that can be detrimental to a pastor and the congregation. Shelly (the author) provides in-sights as to the ""dragons"" and how you might deal with such persons. This is good reading regarding conflict management."
4,Exellent book that touches this subject very well,"Really really enjoyd this book that was recommended to me by my pastor. It took me 2 days to finish it, because i could not stop after i had started reading the book.I find the subject difficoult for people to talk about, so that is another reason why this book is SO important for people to read. Its written in an easy way that is very easy for the reader to understand.In some way I think this book should be a requirement for pastors to read. During my own 4 years of bible college we never touched this subject but being involved in ministry I very quickly could see how this problem is very very real and serious.Thank you for a goood bookEmil"
3,show tunes and hymns thrown together.,"I love Motab. I hate show tunes. throw the two together and I've got some serious mixed feelings. This CD treats you to a beautiful, non-Mary-worshiping version of Ave Maria and then assaults you with ""When Johnny Came Marching Home."" My recommendation: buy the songs you want on Itunes and stay far away from pieces taken from Broadway musicals."
2,Rehashed,"The material in this collection is fabulous but not all original. I forked out some hard-earned bucks because I thought I was getting new fiction on the cutting edge by authors that I had read and admired and found that this book offered a lot of warmed up leftovers. Most of the big names in this collection gave the author rights to reprint material from their previously published books, books that were several years old. I think the book was marketed in a misleading way."
4,"A bit dated, but still effective","This workout is full of the old leg warmers and sweat bands, but you can't beat it for great toning exercises. It focuses mainly on the hips, thighs and gluts with some ab and arm work. It is a very thorough (45 minutes or so) toning workout."
5,This is indeed an excellent tape,"It is hard -- in the beginning, we hardly got past the warm-up; then it was a major fight to finish the first round of thigh exercises, etc. -- but very well done. You just feel like finishing it, for Greg Smithey keeps your interest going, and all these ordinary people behind him seem to be able to do it, so why not you... This is the only exercise video my wife and me have ever done with pleasure, and, subsequently, with clear results."
3,Ouch!,"Good hip and bun workout, if you like being sore from a workout this'll do it. For me it really slims the hips more than the buns. Love Greg Smithey, he's hilarious. I'd give this 4 stars but the first side is always worked out more than the second side, in one case 10 min. on one side and 5 on the other. But I just switch which side I do first each time I do the workout. When I remember to. Well, now I do right side first on odd days of the month and left first on even."
4,Dated or retro still a great workout.,"After using it for 11 years, this is still one of my favourite workouts. Of course, everything you've heard about the dated 80s look (complete with headbands and legwarmers) the bad music and the hosts goofy sense of humour is true. But you can always turn down the sound and play your own music. Even if it's dated, I still like it for the following reasons: the host gives excellent directions and it's easy to keep up, the opening cardio section is challenging but low-impact. The floor routine that follows will burn every muscle in your legs and booty, but contains some stretching and yoga that kills the pain. Beginners won't get lost, advanced will still feel the burn, and when it does, eventually, get easier - do what I did - add leg weights.My only criticism of the video is the crunch section. I like to go more slowly with crunches and carefully guard my neck position. So when I get to that section I usually turn it of and pop in an Abs of Steel instead."
5,Original and best: Quick & Effective; Deserves cult status,"As often happens with an exceptional entry into the 'creative' market, this videotape is unassuming, clearly modest with no ridiculous claims or expectations of becoming the hit it obviously became. (Now ""Buns of Steel"" is a trademark sporting several subtitles, which doesn't stop another trademark from having Buns of Steel as a subtitle.) This tape spawned the market, and it is (...at least one of...) the best of its kind.If you are looking for an exercise video that will have you using it despite how difficult it is, how silly you feel, and how long it takes (at 50 minutes it may be the longest straight video like this) this is the one. It's tough. But you find yourself going ahead despite how hard the work is. DON'T GO FOR A SEQUEL FIRST! look for this one (now called ""Buns of Steel: The Original"" - make certain it has Greg Smithey!) END"
2,tough!,This tape is the Original Buns of Steel and promises visible results in (I believe) six weeks. This tape is very tough and not for beginners. I felt frustrated as I tried to get through the tape and I was so sore that I decided not to continue a few times that I attempted to do the tape. Plus I felt the tape was long and I found myself concentrating on when the tape was over instead of form and what I was doing.Skip this.
4,There is nothing like the original!,"I've tried a couple of different videos to target hips and buns and this original video is a classic. Being a classic however, you do have to make sure that all the moves are still ok from a medical position. Personally, I think they're all fine.This video is the best at targeting your hips and buns.Never mind the old, dated music, just know the exerices work."
5,Happybuns and thighs,"Even though this tape is older the workout is excellent! I keep the remote control close by so that I can pause it when I need to. I recommend doing these exercises at your own pace, don't try to keep up with them. The results for me were felt more than seen for a long time and now they are also seen. Everything that was going south is now back in place and when I get out my routine my muscles will ache until I get back into it. If you want results over the long term, this is the tape to have."
2,Really? Buns of Steel?,"First, it is funny to see the style of the '80's. Wow! What were we thinking?I do like the instructor Greg, but the workout is an all over body workout and doesn't focus on the buns as the title claims it does.The speed at which the exercises are done, leg lifts, etc. are done at a rather fast pace and though it's okay, personally I think the pace could and should be slowed down a bit. So I played the 'floor segment' in slo-motion and found that it was much better. (I don't do the other portions.) You get the burn either way but with the slo-mo you have more control of your movements and less chance of feeling an ache or pain in your joints.I say $20 is a bit steep for the quality of this work-out. I'm sure there are better bun workout DVDs out there and so my quest continues......"
2,Good customer service,This product was defective and not usable. I emailed the seller and was credited for the item. Good customer service.
2,More than just buns,"I thought BUNS OF STEEL would concentrate on exercises to improve your posterior. While it indeed teaches several such exercises, the video also takes you through other moves not related to your lower half. It seems as though the filmmakers shot a workout class and later decided to market it as a glutes-exercise video.Other BUNS OF STEEL reviews correctly point out the instructor's non-stop patronizing chatter. Too bad he didn't discuss basic information, such as recommending how often to exercise or injury prevention.BUNS OF STEEL lasts for about an hour with no breaks. I would have preferred if they followed the lead of the excellent Tamilee Webb video tape ABS OF STEEL, which guides you through three 10-minute routines, one routine per day.There may be better glute exercise tapes out there. But you can learn a few things from BUNS OF STEEL, despite its flaws. Bottoms up!"
1,How are we supposed to like this video?,"What is this video doing? Oh, the 80s music was great! NOT. The instructor was GREAT! NOT. GO to the 8 minute things cause those are waaay better, you don't get some instructor in a skimpy outfit with bad clothes. A bit dated is right! It's all about style"
5,"Great challange, really enjoy those late 80's styles!","Tough workout, I've been doing it every other day for a week and I'm just about able to make it through the whole tape without stopping. It's a burner. You'll love the way it makes you feel because you know you're DOING SOMETHING GOOD FOR YOURSELF! Many thanks to my girlfriend and next door neighbor for turning me onto the tape and working out with me. One hint, we mute Greg and put on a good CD."
5,Squeeze those cheeseburgers out of those thighs!,"Greg Smithey is awesome! Don't be deceived by the high cheese factor and prevelence of 80's rejects in this video, you will get a great workout. Your buns will actually begin to feel different in your pants after the first few workouts. Just know the pain will go away, and will be well worth it. The only thing that irritates me about this video is that it seems like Greg loses count of the repetitions sometimes. I alternate sides each time I do the workout (left leg first one time, right leg first the next) just to ensure I get an even workout. Far better than any of the later Buns workouts I've done. Greg, although quite a dork, makes you feel sexy and beautiful. It's almost like you have to finish the workout just so you don't let him down!"
5,Still a GREAT workout,"I am a group ex instructor and I taught for Greg at the Hip Hop Club in Alaska!! I was there the day they shot the video..Those were my friends and I LOVED them all!!!..YES...It was 1987....THE clothes were horrible and yes...HE did have a ""curl,"" but who cares. If you took the SAME exercises today and did them in class, which I sometimes do, you will see that they are effective and they are hard. Now that we are all so much more educated and we have core training and sport specific training etc....sometimes getting back to the ""basics"" of lots and lots of reps and different angles is a REFRESHING change!They waited for years to review it and raked it over the coals and I thought it was very unfair, and yet today it's STILL a favorite....Get over the clothes and the hair and the music and get a great workout....LOL!!:)Have fun!!"
4,80's flash back but good!,"I used to do this workout in the 80""s and 90""s. The clothes and hairstyle's date this workout but it does a great job on your hips, inner thigh and buns. I was happy I could purchase it on DVD, since we no longer have a VHS player."
5,Excellent,This work out video is the best. I have only used it for a day but my backside and my thighs are killing me from the intense workout. I am sure if I use it everyday I will surely start seeing results.The only downside of this is that the video looks pretty ancient. Apart from that its not a big deal because the work out routines are fantastic and I think beat any of the modern workout videos there are for buns.I think that its a video worth owning.
4,Brutal But Effective,It is a brutal tape but it is extremely effective. I gave it a 4 for not being on DVD. I want this one and Tamilee Webb's Buns of Steel on DVD. I am currently using the Tamilee Webb version on VHS and fear it will snap soon. It is also very effective but shorter. You have to be careful with both of these or you could hurt your knees.
5,This workout rocks!!,"This is my first review on a workout video but I had to come to the table. First who cares about the retro looks?? At the time of taping it was the ""IN"" Clothes, hairstyles, and music change with the times but a really great workout is timeless!! And that my friends is what you have with this workout! A realyy Great timeless workout that will get you results guaranteed!! This is the 3rd time I am buying this since the late 80's lost the other 2 in previous moves. Now I am in my mid 40's and wanting to still look good in a bathing suit, so this is the workout that will do it for you. I highly recommend this to anyone with a vhs player and a desire to ""Melt away the cheeseburgers"" as Greg Smithey says. 5 stars all the way and 10 stars if the option was availabe. Only draw back is it is on vhs and not put on dvd as alot of people just don't have vhs anymore! Maybe in the future it will get converted to dvd. Happy Melting!!"
5,BEST WORKOUT!!!,"First...this is a great workout. Yes, it is 80's...but it is really humorous. It is the best workout for your butt and thighs...you will be sore! My question is when are they going to put this on DVD?"
4,Great workout,"Nothing like the original Buns of Steel to get your lower body workout. The only negative is that Greg sounds a little nasal and drives you batty after a while. Also, the music is VERY monotonous. Hey, it's the 80's..."
4,"Tough, but effective","Greg is cheesy, and beginners may have difficulty finishing the entire workout. Nothing I've tried works as well for toning and shaping the lower body, though. Even doing as much as you can at first, you'll still see results."
5,The Best,"This is a great workout video. I used this tape religiously in 1994 and began to notice my butt and hips actually shaping up and getting slimmer. It is the only thing that has worked for me in toning up this area. I put the video away for a while and have just started using it again. I am eager to see the results again, but it's hard work and you have to keep it up! It's a cheesy old video, but hilarious too because of the music and the hairstyles. Greg Smithey is cheesey too but keeps you motivated. A great video that really works."
4,Great Workout with Caution,"I purchased this video back in 1994 and the reviews I've seen here in Amazon are 100% on. This is the toughest and most targeted of workouts I have ever done. The music and dress are wayyyyy outdated, but, like the majority stated, the results do speak for themselves. I combined this tape with Cher Fitness and Tamilee Webb Abs and in three months, I lost 18 pounds.My word of caution is this: If you are injured or with injury, I would not reccomend this tape. The majority of exercises are done on the floor and require that your anchor, your back and abs, be extrordinarily strong."
2,Around The World,"This CD was not what I expected. I had been informed that the fourth hymn was outstanding -- but it was/is one of the weakest pieces by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I listened to it once, and that was it. Sorry."
1,Not as it seems,I am very disappointed that the cover shows vinyl siding there is NOTHING in this video that I recieved that says anything about vinyl siding it is all about wood lap siding.what a rip do not purchase as a how to guide to vinyl siding.
3,Sincere advice with one little problem,"I don't question John Tesh's intentions in writing this book. It's all common sense advice. The chapters are called Dream, Purpose, Passion, Risk, Faith, Courage, Fulfillment, Legacy. He discusses walking away from Entertainment Tonight to pursue the music he loved, and therein lies the problem. When he discusses ""walking away from a seven figure salary,"" my reaction is ""he had a seven figure salary to walk away from."" Yes, he took a risk. Yes, he's been ridiculed as often as he's been applauded. Good, heartfelt advice, only slightly tainted by the fact that it was a lot easier (financially) for John Tesh to pursue his dream than it is for most of the people who will read this book. When he gets to the ""do what you love, and maybe the money will follow"" section, it's a little insulting...even though I'm sure he didn't intend it that way."
3,Early History Only,"For a mass market book of this type, it is long on early history, i.e., on or before the middle of the 18th century, and short on modern history. In particular, it does not discuss the seminal event in America's love affair with alcohol--Prohibition. It's hard to see how a book which seems to purport itself as a retrospective history could omit this painful and exciting period."
3,valuable but too long,Little else is on this topic and there is much excellent information but also much irrelevant speculation and the author is at times a bit pretentious. The illustrations are important but unhappily the reproductions are so awful that it is impossible to see what the author says is in those pictures.
3,A USEFUL REFERENCE,The book contains a lot of useful information for people working in the satellite communications area.The english could be better maybe because this is a translation from the french. All in all a good reference.
1,"Aaahh yeah, ok","This movie is just pointless. If you want a good movie with different lives, then see ""Sliding Doors"" or ""The Dead Girl"". Besides, there are subtitles in spanish that you can not turn off either by the DVD player or the DVD itself. Don't bother with this one. It is very stupid and pointless."
5,PBS gone nuts!,All 472 PBS American Master's shows on 19 dvd's. Even if you don't like all the shows this is still a good buy.
1,Home from the Hill by Fred Webb,I would rate the stories as okay but I couldn't get past the profanity and filthy language to enjoy them. I would not recommend the book to anyone.
5,Crashing Success,"At the last minute, another teacher and I teamed up to teach a summer course in study skills for middle school students. Neither of us had taught this class before, and we were ready to hit the panic button until we came across this book. A quick look at the table of contents told us that this was what we were looking for, and we have followed most of the contents religiously so far (we are one week into the course we're teaching as I write this). The information, the games, the exercises, student activities -- everything in the book is proving helpful to us. The reproducible handouts and worksheets are great, the kids seem to like the activities and are often surprised at what they learn about themselves and their study skills. I think the book would be equally helpful for teachers to work on study skills intermittently during the school year; but for a class which concentrates on these skills, it is indispensable!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS CHEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"CAUTION!!!!!!!!!!! I purchased AND PAID for TWO of these. I received ONE,with invoice showing ONE,Receipt shows paid for TWO.They provide a telephone number for any issues, I called and it is a fax machine,(Never a live person,or even a recording). I sent THREE Emails to no avail. They do NOT RESPOND!! This vendor should have no affiliation with Amazon as they are giving a bad name, I am now shopping elsewhere as Amazon lost my business..........."
3,smells great!!!,"didnt realize how small product really is!! for the price,its worth it to test out the different scents. they do smell great...all of them!!!"
3,I got it!,It is much smaller than this photo size in website. But it is ok as a small gift for my friend.
2,tooo tinie,ok the delivery was very fast but dam this thing is small and is not like the picture at all any way im satisfied and one advice if your looking for a big or medium cologne dont buy this one
2,Cheap and best,I got it for a mery 5 $ each set which I feel is the best deal on this set.But... these were tooo tiny in reality.. they were not as big as they look like in the picture.
4,good movie,Entertaining and well done. Builds up to a final battle at the end. Would have like to see more samurai action throughout but good none the less.
4,Excellent movie,"Plenty of others have went into plenty of descriptive detail.Movie is a bit slow the first half, but sets everything up for the second half.Gets almost frantic and fast for the last 45 minutes. Story of samurai in a sense like some of the American westerns are stories of famous gun fighters.Good movie and not at all like shallow US action movies of recent years."
4,13 Assassins,"If you can read and like Samari, this is one of the better movies to watch. Great plot, good story line. Very bloody. Not for kids"
5,Great Chanbara!,"Bloody, gritty, Violent... Realistic in the sense that the fighters get tired killing their enemies... Must see if you're a Samurai movie fan!!!"
4,Kept me entertained,"Was it the best movie I have seen? No, but it was pretty good and I would watch it again. The story was good but moved a little slow at times. The action scenes were prety good. I've never seen a scene like the one where the girl writes the note with her mouth - yikes! Talk about a chilling visual part of the movie."
3,Typical,"Typical ""Karate"" movie. A few good guys doing battle with hundreds. Jet Li's ""Fearless"" is a great example of a great movie. Check it out instead."
1,13 Assassins,"I purchased the 13 Assassins BluRay disc. There is absolutely no indication on Amazon or on the DVD that is sub-titled. I know there is a sub-titled version listed, but this one makes no mention of it. I would not purchase a sub-titled DVD. I can't comment on the movie, since I did not wish to sit through a mivoe with sub-titles."
3,Good not Great,"This movie is a very good movie, but not a great movie. It is Ok for adults, but no kids under 16. Even though I enjoyed it, my wife hated it."
4,That was fun.,"I watched this on Netflix streaming. All I have to say is, make sure that you use up all of your ammo(arrows), before going in to the final fight. Just my opinion."
5,13 assassins,"If you like well made japanese movies of this genre then watch this movie.It's well directed, well acted, well filmed and I wish there were more like it."
2,samurai drama,"Starts out as an average samurai drama but devolves into a pathetic Computer-generated imagery (CGI) battle fest that is too long and idiotic. 170 swordsmen can't beat 13 skimpy swordsmen. Okay, so if you have the brain of an 8 year old drooling mongoloid you'll love this, but if you love classic Japanese samurai films of the 60's, avoid this."
5,Opus of death,"This movie was stunning from start to finish. Portraying the truly undying spirit of the samurai. Beautiful cinimatography, choreography. Lots of blood and guts and glory and honor. If you like kung fu, samurai, gore, ninja, roasted rabbit than this is for you."
1,The worse mailing service,"Im still waiting the deliver of the movie, the worst service, 13 day and counting,im not buying anymore from this provider.About the movie, i dont known,will see."
2,"If you like historical pieces, then this one's for you","I have studied martial arts all of my life and love watching actions movies about my favorite subject. 13 Assassins is a very well made movie, but I wouldn't call it a marital arts movie by a longshot. I watched all 2 hrs. of this movie waiting for it to morph into my kinda of movie, but unfortunately for me it never happened. The Man from Nowhere morphed and I would highly recommend it (over 13 Assassins) and it was all in Korean with English subtitles. Hence, you know it had to have been a better movie. Why am I writing this review - to save 2 hrs. of your life and whatever it costs you to rent it. Buying this movie would be a big mistake, unless of course you're into Japanese history. LOL"
1,"Unless You Are 12-16 Years Old, Skip It","I can't understand how anyone over 16 could like this movie. In my opinion, the hallmark of a great action movie is intelligent plotting and realistic action (e.g. Die Hard I or The Departed or Casino Royale). This comes nowhere near, offering nothing more than mindless action. It's like a YouTube compilation of Samurai fight scenes from movies. Unless that's you're thing, skip this one. I'm still trying to figure out how it received such high marks on Rotten Tomatoes..."
1,Why 126 min and not the full 141 minutes?,I can't understand why Amazon or the other sites this film is available for viewing on does not have the full 141 minute version.
3,Worst Preview - Trailer on Amazon,"A man gutting himself? Really not a great selling maneuver nor does this do justice to this, a very good film."
4,Awfully Good,I watched this movie from Amazon Prime. Looking for something new and different led me to this enjoyable movie. The acting is believable and the story in the Shogun era of Asia.A plot against a cruel shogun who has a dark side that would have almost everyone signing up to join the 13 Assassins.Albeit you would have to have been a Shogun descendant to take part. The down side of streaming this movie was keeping up with the sub-titles. I am going to purchase this movie as I believe that you can have a dub over for the spoken parts. I am rating this a four star on that premise otherwise the rating would have been a 3 star.
4,Good Story and Sword play. Okay Martial Arts.,"Might not want to watch at night on a full stomach. 13 Assassins is a good movie worth watching. I'm not sure what language is spoken, however, their are english subtitles. The action takes a little time to develop, however, once it starts it is non stop. In my opinion, this is not a kick, punch, and flip flix. It is true to the time period and showcases Sword play. Not what I expected, but, still enjoyable."
2,Brainless action movie,"The praise for this movie is ridiculous. ""Historically accurate""???? Puh-leeeze. Don't make me laugh. This is NOT a serious samurai drama. Its more of a brainless action movie. Think... the Bride Vs. Crazy 88s in Kill Bill. Pretty much the same thing. Except, this one has old Japanese men with bad haircuts."
2,at lease I watched to the end,"But could anyone tell me , the bandit guy (armed with rock ) was killed by a short sword , I can see the sword cutting into his neck ,and in the ending part , he just came back alive and jump like a monkey again? So it makes me wonder , is the mystery in the cutted 20 mins that everyone else is talking about ? mm-hmm . anyhow , the story telling was clear . you might already have an imagine of the whole storyline after about 25mins of watching it . remind me of the 300 . oh and better subtitles next time ,please ."
4,Action...,"I rated this BD 4 stars because of the colors:compared to ""flying daggers"" the gray and black are ok,but the bright colors are dull.But for the sound and the action,5 stars!"
4,Flaming Bulls!,"So pretty much all the 3-5 star reviews are pretty spot on. I never saw the theater release so I don't know about the missing 15 (or so) minutes. However there is a character who might be a forest spirit or a bandit that is kind of hard to explain. Apparently some of the missing 15 help with that.The 1st hour is a little hard simply because the bad guy is really bad. Some of his badness was hard to view. This makes the last hour worth hanging on for. Once the action starts it doesn't stop. There are flaming bulls involved. I don't know if this was supposed to be funny, but that was the best humorous beat down since Jet Li beat the Samurai at the end of Fist of Legend with his belt.If you liked ""Seven Samurai"" or even ""The Magnificent Seven"" you'll know what's going to happen, but you'll like it anyway."
3,Good plot and action sequences,"While the movie had excellent sword play and admirable adherrence to the samurai code, it fell apart (for me) towards the climatic finish, because it appeared to transition from rational, to fantasy."
3,a real butcher shop!!,"pretty thin compared with other samurai classics. however, the set-up for making 11 to odds an even match are clever. it's ok, but i prefer the more classical tales of the samurai and only the best asian writers and directors are able to pull off!"
5,Blown away,I just watched this movie. It has been a while since a movie grabbed me like this one. I have traveled to Japan many times and I really enjoyed this glance at their history. I am glad that this movie used subtitles. The energy and passion of the Japanese language was thrilling. This is a great guy movie. I will watch this again. Wow.
5,Loved It!,"This was everything an action film should be. The sword play was well done and choreographed. Very entertaining. It reminded me of both The Magnificant Seven and Chushingura (The 47 Ronin). Amazon came through again with great service, tracking, shipping."
3,I don't get it,"I rented this based on all the praise this has gotten from critics. It seemed like a typical samurai film to me. Tons of blood and death, but not overly gory or anything. It was fun to watch, although the prolonged fighting started to get tedious at times. But that's being pretty nitpicky. It'll keep you entertained. My problem is that it isn't an incredible movie. It's entertaining if you're in to these types of movies, nothing more in my opinion."
3,So-so,"This is a mostly-forgettable movie along the lines of ""The Seven Samurai"" (or the western ""The Magnificent Seven"" which was inspired by it). The action is fine if that's your cup of tea, but 13 protagonists is just too many to allow much in the way of characterization."
2,Disappointed,Not sure if I just didn't read the description but I thought this was a martial arts movie not a samauri with swords.
2,A rare disappointment from miike,"I've seen most of Takashi Miike's movies and I can say this is a rare disappointment from his previous films. I've seen hundreds of different Yakuza/Samurai movies and when compared to them, there are simply better movies to be found.13 Assassins does 2 things right as far as casting excellent actors for the movie and the cinematography is amazing. However the movie's downsides are blatant use of CG, why would you make such a beautiful picture only to ruin it with horrible Computer animations? Also the movie feels rushed, the character development is made unlike something like the 7 samurai where the build up each supporting character, no one really cares about their deaths which makes this movie fall short.If this is your first samurai film, yes it will be amazing and thats why this one is rated so high however there are better works to be seen like izo, Lone wolf and cub, and the 7 samurai just to start. Veterans like myself will be disappointed to say the least."
4,DISTURBING IMAGES!!!,"This movie could have easily been perfect, 5 Stars. The disgusting images very early on in the film should have been scrapped! I know the director wanted to convey just how evil Naritsugu really was. But, some things you can allude to without showing. The samurai plot is great, the actors are spot on, the sets are all awesome! Great action movie, but I don't know if you want the women and children to ever see this... With that said, this is easily the best and probably the most accurate portrayal of Feudal Japan on film!"
4,My kind of Movie,"After Ninja Assassin, I didn't think I would find a more recent movie depicting martial arts at its finest. This movie rocks. If you are a fan of martial arts movies with intense battles, you will enjoy 13 Assassins."
4,Excellent but pricey,"My 2.5 and I love this CD--very catchy and fun to sing along with, but I think it's overpriced. Why do I need 16 additional instrumental tracks of the exact same songs? Thanks, but I'm not interested in karoke with my toddler. Other than my complaint about the price, it's a fun addition to our kid-music collection."
4,If You Want To Hear Something Good...,"Listen to this. It's an excellent album, but unfortunately it won't be heard by many except for Mars Volta and At the Drive-In fans. I'd been looking for an album like this for a while, its experimental and demands your full attention as another reviewer said, but it is still listenable, unless of course you're used to listening to pop trash like Britney and Maroon 5. Omar is a superb guitarist and its a pleasure to listen to his playing on this album. I highly reccomend this to people who want to hear something a little different, but still excellent."
5,It's another Biochem Illustrated.,"It's a very good book, since it has enumerous diagrams which make you understand & imagine the biochemical processes better. It can be used in conjunction with the recommended textbook. However, it does not have Pre-test questions."
5,How to Run a Summer Camp Health Lodge,"I am an EMT running a Boy Scout camp health lodge. This is a great book, and provides protocols that are ready to adapt to any camp situation. I searched the Internet and found that the lowest cost for the book is on Amazon."
4,GREAT FOR NEWBIES....,"This is my first year as a camp nurse, and so far, I'm wing'n it. This book gives a lot of good information and helpful tips.<...>"
4,well done Mr. Freeman,"Paul Freeman's models are masculine and 'real' looking: not shaved and tanned and chiseled. They often appear as hard-working, hard-playing men you'd find at construction sites, beaches, or the neighborhood pub.Naked and natural, they are beautifully lighted and nautrally posed."
1,Typically Overrated,"'Broken' is sentimentally insincere, a melodramatic cliche, and is grossly overrated. It's amazing how easily groups cash-in by stringing together a few power chords, looping a few sound clips, and having some producer slice-and-dice the whole mess into a formulated 'hit'. The first thing I wondered when I heard this song was whether or not these posers could actually sing a song beginning to end.This song is a prime example of why listeners should educate their ears and demand more from a tired, uninspired recording industry. There is a lot of truly creative, fresh music out there. Work a little, find it, and give your money to the real musical innovators."
5,Broken is a fantastic song,"Broken is an awesome song. It's a collaboration between Seether and Amy Lee from Evanasance. It's a well written, played, and sung song. This also happens to be the only other way of getting it if you don't buy the Punisher soundtrack.Amy Lee has the best vocals in Rock right now. I love hearing this woman sing. It's a shame that Moody left there band and that they are on hold right now. Despite that she made herself another hit with this song. I love it when her and the lead guy from Seether are singing the chorus together. Duets aren't something we see enough of anymore in Rock.The song is just awesome. It's hard and soft in all the right places. It's gotten a ton of Radio play and Video play. Rightfully so because this song should of.If you like Seether or Evanasance you won't regret picking this one up. It's a great song."
5,YES!,I received this before I got the Sansa Mp3 player. Fast shipment. I dont know about the quality yet though...will respond back.
4,Good collection,"The only thing misleading about this package was that I thought (according to the pictures) that there were multiple LCD plastic covers included, it only comes with one. Otherwise, I am very happy, the case is really great!"
3,Its ok.,"The charger is great. No need to keep your PC on 24/7. The belt clip broke while trying to use it(cheap plastic), I use the arm band often hasn't broke yet. The band is solid but the rubber sleeve it holds on to seems thin. I've been jogging w/ for months and its still good, so I gues its ok.Buy it for the chargers and put the other stuff in the same catagory you would a free toaster for opening a bank account."
2,OK BUT DIFFERENT!,I have been a fan of bobby since he started & this lastest album is different. I was shocked when i heard it for the 1st time. The cumbias are faster i had a hard time keeping up with the song. He has change so much since his last album. I think he should stick to Tejano (what he does best).
3,Slide Viewer,Dust on the inside of the projector lens is hard to clean. Mechanism not tolerant of slightly bent slides - allows them to get stuck and hard to remove.
1,don't buy it,"I've had two of these. One was a while ago and it didn't work too well, but I needed another slide viewer and thought they had to have changed the design in 20 years, but no, they still aren't worth a dollar. It should be an easy thing to mfg., but they are still made with a very poor design. DON'T BUY IT."
4,Pana Vue Review,Product was perfect for what I needed. 500 Slides that had to be reviewed prior to converting to DVD. This Pana Vue allows for multiple slide viewing. Tricky to put together (loading batteries) but take your time and read directions very carefully.
3,very good,I needed to sort slides to have them put on a DVD. This was an inexpensive way to do this.
1,Bummer The rating should be ...minus a star.,We bought a new bulb and new batteries...It still wouldn't work. I returned it.
3,acceptable with some caveats,"Out of the box, it did not initially work with batteries. I had to take it apart about 4 times before I finally figured out that one battery contact was loose. I solved the problem by jamming a penny between the contact and the battery. Also the slide feeder jams repeatedly and you have to reach in and unjam slides. Finally small bits of dirt or lint get inside the lense and can't be removed. I used it to screen over 1000 slides prior to digitization. It is OK for that job."
4,Simple and effective,"This item was received as it appeared. It works ok, but I did have some trouble with a few of the slides sticking either in the intray, middle or out tray. Not too bad though and it was easier than feeding a slide in the single viewers."
5,35 mm Slide Viewer a wonderful classic,"The viewer is identical to the one that we have used for over 25 years. It is reliable, will accomodate a stack of slides, easy to use and the screen is large enough to be easily useble. My wife looks through our 35 mm slides, sorts them on a slide sorter, labels them and inserts them into capacity trays. She then updates the master list. We have a 49+ year library of our slides. This viewer is perfect for use in identifying the locations etc shown on the slides."
1,Pana Vue Slide Viewer,"This product is very flimsy and cheaply made. It worked OK for the first 100 slides or so, I put through it for viewing. After that it started consistently sending a second slide into the viewing chamber along with the slide selected. This really slowed down the viewing and could damage the slides. I do not recommend this product. As it turned out, in total frustration, I found someone with a old Kodak slide projector that would lend it to me to finish reveiwing all the remaining trays of slides."
3,Panavue slide viewer,"It took some time to get the batteries installed properly. After that, the unit worked as I expected it to. The bulb was bright and it was fairly easy to use to look at lots of slides."
3,not the greatest,device jams frequently which requires taking it apart and having to assemble it again. I thought it would be better
3,Very retro and still cool,"This unit is made in Spain. Yes Spain, how about that! Anyway it's not everything I imagined as the system is a little primitive and does not work that smoothly every time but hey, it does work. You have to repeat the shuffling of the slides mechanism a few times to get it to work occasionally but it does work! Still a good buy for the $."
3,Sunny Day Sunday Favorite,"It's not a bad cd after all. I had my doubts at first, but then I tried it. Sentimental Buss has real talent...but they could switch their style of song singing - that voice could be singing other great hits. My favorite would have to be Sunny Day Sunday because it's a mix of rock and up-beat tempos. Not bad at all."
3,Adequate research - poor analysis - poisonous portrayal,"Mr. Levy has provided his readers with what can only be described as a surprisingly mean-spirited account of the life and times of an uncommonly decent, and quite remarkable, man. The author's analysis of the research material cited must have been incredibly superficial, or else unfairly subjective, in order for him to have maintained, throughout his book, such a consistently negative and ill-informed opinion of General Cohen's character and achievements. The numerous detailed footnotes accompanying the text are, however, well worth re-visiting in their original form for anyone genuinely interested in trying to unravel the fabulously interesting life of the enigmatic General Morris Abraham ""Two-Gun"" Cohen."
2,tiresome and ugly,"In Shanghai in the late 1920s, a Scottish psychotherapist treats a woman suffering from hallucinations. The patient, Julia Paradise, is the wife of a Christian missionary and begins an affair with the psychotherapist, telling him her secret history as a victim of incest.The novel is incredibly short, just 123 pages, but manages to make of itself a rather offensive spectacle, dealing as it does only with ugly portraits of sexuality. None of the characters become worthy of our empathy or even sympathy. This is in rather bold contrast to Rod Jones' later novel ""Billy Sunday."" Perhaps ""Julia Paradise"" would have succeeded had Jones delved more into Julia's hallucinations, presenting them as the sort of surreal dream he accomplished with ""Billy Sunday."""
1,I can't actually think of anything good to say about it.,"Rod Jones was enthusiastically recommended to me by an Australian friend of mine. I have to say that I just do not get it.I found Julia Paradise to be disjointed, grotty, pompous, and at least a little bit silly. As a reinterpretation of Freud I found it obvious and not terribly interesting. I read it quickly and was not either moved or offended. It just seemed like a waste of time. Very difficult for me to see why this won a national fiction award in Australia.Perhaps I would like something else by Jones better. Hard to say. All I know is that I will not be rushing to find out."
3,Beware of Apex_Media,"I rented this book from Apex_media and noticed when the book came there was a small tear in on the back cover. Since it was not severe I did not think anything of it. However, when I returned the book, apex_media charged me the full price for the book due to some alleged damage to the cover that was there when they sent it! I immediately contacted Amazon and they refused the charge and apologized for the mistake. Beware of apex_media they do not go through Amazon other than being fulfilled by them!!Other than that, the book was ok. I enjoyed the read but the author is a little biased about family incomes and the probability of the parents being addicted to drugs and/or cigarettes. The author seems to have stereotyped families with low incomes. The truth is, it could happen to any family, not just low income."
3,Be Careful,"this book does not come with the access code to ""mydevelopmentlab.com"" that many college professors require you to have"
2,dissapointing remixes,Dissapointing remixes of some good Scissor Sisters tracks. Not worth ordering unless you are a collector.
3,Chevelle + Trapt + Hinder = Fivespeed,"Morning Over Midnight is your typical, generic hard rock record, with all the fixings and not as much style. Traces of all your favorites can be heard on this 10 song, major label release, but with the ammount of favorites most people have, there isn't really a need for a band like fivespeed. Generic to it's core, and only worthy of a listen when everything else has been played out, Morning Over Midnight is painfully bland."
3,"An ok song, an ok single","""Addicted to You"" was a song during Utada Hikaru's Distance era. The song is ok, but to be honest Utada sounds really bored singing it. Sounds like she doesn't want to song, but the song has very catchy parts like ""Keep me addicted"" and ""I think I'm addicted to you."" The second song is ""Addicted to You [Underwater Mix]"" and it's slower and more laid back then the [Up-In-Heaven Mix]. But once again, Utada sounds really bored singing. The single also comes with a karaoke track for both songs. I do recommend the single if you like the song or are collecting Utada's CD's. The songs themselves are a bit boring."
1,It should be called the Fascist Feminist Cookbook,"Wow, this book is absolutely the most sexist book I have ever read. Some of the things that she spouts are completely ridiculous. Not only does she present ""facts"" that are nothing more then something she conjured up; she is constantly refuting proven facts and studies, stating that she is right and they are wrong.I don't know if she has something against males or is just a hateful woman. I can't believe that anyone would actually publish such garbage.The book is called gender roles, but feminist roles is more accurate. The book only provides for one point of view and it constantly states how men are evil and constantly holding women down and making this world terrible.Read it if you want a good laugh and you can stand someone blabbing about some fantasies that she has for the ending of male society, possibly then ending of the male gender."
4,Deceptive Advertisement,"If there is confusion concerning this golf set, It is due to deceiving advertisement and picture. The picture displays a 5 iron and the set is described as 17 piece set. if you count the head covers, bag, 5-9, SW, PW, Putter, 1-3 Wood and 2 hybrid's you would have 17 pieces. Since the 5 iron is not included, they need to correct the photo, change the set to a 16 piece set to eliminate confusion and customer dissapointment."
3,not complete,"When I recieved the first set It did not have a five iron. I requested another set. When it arrived, It did not have a five iron either. So I sent back the second set and kept the first. For my troubles, You gave me $20.00 off of my credit card. I would rather have the five iron, but I'll take it. Could someone check on the order so I dont get charged for both sets. Cause nobody likes me when I'm angry.Sincerly,Russell Pierce"
5,not what you would expect.,if you are looking for the actual nes version of the game. try estarland.com but as far as here don't believe anything they say. all you will be buying is a computer disk instead of an nes cartridge!
4,Does the job,I brewed beer in this and it worked out great. Be careful not to burn something to the bottom though because it is very difficult to clean burned stuff from the bottom.
4,Progressive International Stainless Steel 20 Quart High Dome Stock Pot,"For what I am using it for, its great. I am in college and the low weight is actually a good thing. I have now used it multiple times for corn on the cob and soup and it works great. Vent is a little wierd, so my freind and i cut it out, sanded the edges down, and now it is fine. Overall, I would say that it was worth my money."
2,Barely 20 qt.,"Well, like the title says, it is 20 qt. but i'm very disappointed because you can't put anything else in there, only 20 qt. not even a little extra tiny needle, so if you need 20 qt of some liquid and then add some food or something else, get something bigger because it won't fit."
2,i returned this,"These stock pots are a good size, but much too lightwgt for my purposes. for an extra ten dollars I purchased, from amazon by the way, a much heavier 18/8 pot with five-layer bottom. They are probably good for someone who is able to spend the time in the kitchen while cooking is in progress, and needs something budget-minded.Concord 18/10 Stainless Steel 20 Quart Stock Pot With Glass Lid"
4,Very good for the money,"For ocassional use, great choice. Handles sturdier than expected and vent on top useful. Pot is on the thin side and wouldn't let it boil dry or use excessive heat - now I can make corned beef and cabbage without spilling water when the cabbage goes in!"
4,Good for the price,"I wouldn't suggest buying anything cheaper than this. I got it for home brewing and it works great, its just a little thin."
2,Not what I expected,"Way too thin--you can tell when you pick it up that it's not very sturdy because it doesn't weigh very much. Didn't work for what I needed it for, perhaps good for soaking things...returned on arrival."
4,A great pot for the price.,"The pot is just fine, and the price is right -- nice and big, not hugely thick, but as long as we don't abuse it, it will be fine -- perfect for lobsters, soup, and other large meals!"
4,nice all purpose pot,Very nice all purpose stock pot. Very light weight and excellent for soups and stocks. Probably not the best pot for cooking heavy things such as stews. The domed top has an adjustable steam vent which I really like.
5,Raves for review,My favorite developmental biology text of all time. Now in its' 6th edition it includes an interactive CD with videos and photos. It also has referenced many valuable websites. A truely great book with a fine sensibity to the historical perspectives of science and the complexity and beauty of natural forms. Gilbert publishes regularly in the field of develomental biology and his expertise is obvious.
4,"Good, but single author can't handle all","This is a superb textbook which includes a wide scope of current developmental biology. The new version also embraces a modern interactive technology. It's really cool! The text is fluent and consistent because a single author wrote all the chapters. However, its drawback is that the author can't know all the things. This is contrast to other reputated textbooks such as Molecular Biology of the Cell, Principles of Neural Science, etc., written by multiple authors who have expertises in each chapter. Developmental biology has expanded and now covers evolution, plants, and even behavior. I think Dr. Scott Gilbert is a genius. But I can't believe he can handle all of these stuffs. It's time to ask some people to write each chapter."
4,Strings and more Strings,"I usually prefer soundtracks that have the hard-driven drums and brass, but this classical-sounding score is very beautiful and very pleasant to listen to. I even enjoy the 2 vocal tracks, which is a minor miracle. The string instruments on this soundtrack are both energetic and lush in different moments. I'm glad that I bought this one."
3,not what i thought,i loved this movie and the song MaryAnn played at the end but that was not on this CD. i enjoy the soundtrack but most of the songs were short and didn't give me what i wanted. but i do still enjoy it.
3,Somewhat Dissapointed,"I loved this move & the music so naturally I wanted the soundtrack but was dissapointed when I found out my two favorite songs were not being sung by Kate Winslet like in the film but by Jane Eaglen, who has a lovely voice, but not for these songs. Her voice is far to heavy to do them justice.On the cover it says ""Original motion picture soundtrack."" that is not the case here. If it had been the original soundtrack it would have included Kate Winslet's version of the two songs, Weep No More Sad Fountains & The Dreame, that she sung in the film."
5,Jane Eagle's voice is very comfortable!,"I agree with other reviewer's opinions about her voice in some way. Yes, her voice might not be fit to the character in the movie, but I think her voice is not too trained for the movie. Instead, her voice is very comfortable to me compared with other characteristic divas like Maria Callas. Her voice is powerful but adequate. Overall, I really enjoyed this CD a lot."
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD, but I do agree with other reviewers, KAte Winslet's voice should be the one sining ""Weep You No More Sad Fountains"" Her voice is beautiful."
3,Not so good,"This book was difficult to read because it is so disjointed and un-clear. It has some good experience information, but is more like her personal discombobulated diary than a clear story."
1,Wrong measurements,"This says 3 and 1/2 inch inlet. I took it out of the box, and much to my shagrin, the inlet is 2 and 7/8 inches. Considering my tailpipes are 3 inches, I was quite annoyed. Even the length in the description is wrong. It says 9 inches, yet, once again....take it out of the box and it's 8 and 3/4 inches. Very odd measurement system used by this manufacturer. I'm not positive they really know what an ""inch"" actually is. Oh well."
4,All 4 volumes of Nesbitt's series are a must-read!,I have read all 4 volumes of Mark's series and I recommend them to anyone interested in Civil War spirits. Mark's writing style is convincing enough that you know the accounts cannot be hoaxes. You can't possibly not believe in ghosts after reading this series. Hope Mark comes out with a volume 5.
5,Great Ghosts of Gettysburg,"This was a great, yet small, book. I especially enjoyed the story of the young soldier, Culp, who took a message of his dying friend to his girl in Gettysburg. It didn't make it. Culp was killed, near his relatives' farm, and the girl was the only civilian casualty."
4,Prize for Social Studies Students,I purchased this book as a prize for my 8th grade Social Studies student with the best Civil War project. The girl who won has not put it down so I will take that as a sign that it is really good!
4,good ghost stories,A good book to learn about some of the haunted locations in Gettysburg and the stories behind them. A very enjoyable read of the history and what still goes on today from those 3 fateful days in July 1863.
2,I've bought better,Basically just word of mouth folk lore. I collect ghost related books and this one was pretty dull.
1,Received wrong item,I would love to read this book but Amazon shipped two of the wrong books to my home. Hopefully this book will be in one of the book shops in Gettysburg when I visit.
5,Best book on Breast Health,"Every woman should read this book and practice what this book teaches us about the breast health. It is easy to read and understand. If you practice what it recommends, it is a good investment towards good health."
2,This is like a soap opera SPOOF.,"Assuming you've already read the book description, I won't rehash the plot, as it would just make me dizzy. So many things going on, so many coincidences, so many unlikable characters. Still, I kept reading, knowing that the author was going to have somehow make these people redeem themselves. And they do, sort of. By the end of the book everyone was happy. That is, everyone except for me.When I picked the book up, it was just for light reading. The description was cute. But the angry, vindictive main character turned me off right from the beginning. There were many times I wondered how the editor, let alone the author, could read this book and think it plausible enough to be published. Talk about twisting a plot. This book was much too contrived to be believed."
2,Amusing but no substance,"If shallowness could speak, this book would roar. Family dysfunction, selfishness, and intimate secrets have their literary places, but this book misses the boat. Full of preposterous coinicidences, underdeveloped characterers, and a foul-mouthed rather hopeless heroine, I would say a light beach read, but no more. The ""lessons on life"" were too trite to carry much weight. If looking for a view from heaven, check out Lovely Bones, but this one is very skippable."
4,"Highly original, highly entertaining and highly educational","Rat is that rare film - documentary or not - that educates while it entertains. While definitely not for the vermin phobes amongst us, Rat offers a fascinating and truly entertaining struggle of one of the most hardy and intelligent creatures which shares our streets, businesses and even homes. Watch Rat and you'll develop new respect and fear of this most adaptive animal."
1,Useless for people who know VB6,"The title says all. I think the author simply replaced the word ""VB6"" with "".Net"" in his book."
5,Excellent resource de-claws VB.NET,"Mr. Foxall is a conversational writer who is easy to follow no matter what the subject matter is about. I have exchanged several e-mails with him and he is an extremely friendly person. Some of the Teach Yourself books are really not written for beginners, but this book is definitely easy to understand. As an experienced VB programmer, I found this book a great introduction to VB.NET."
3,Simon Says Review,This toy can prove very frustrating no matter what one's age. I've found that it was used by all the first day and now has been retired to the book shelf.
5,Great insight for our company.,This DVD was bought for our company...and have already heard great reviews. I recommend to others!
2,Doesn't work with newer computers,"Installing the program was a pain and once it was installed it said that quicktime was not installed even though I have the latest edition. Tech support, which to find was bit of wild goose chase, told me that I had to uninstall my version of quicktime and install the version of quicktime included with the software."
1,Barely Underwater not so Wonderland,"Very weak. Half of this video is shot in a fish tank. The quality is marginal and even the fish seem to know how poor this will turn out. This is a completely amateur production. I don't know about the inspirational messages, I turned off that feature after the first one, which wasn't that inspirational."
5,beyond belief,"when i went to write this review, i wanted to give it 6 stars. this album literally breaks the rubric. Hardcore, melodic, beautiful, mewithoutYou packs punch after punch, finally completing the cd with one of the most amazing songs of all time. If you dont by [A-->B] life your not truly experiencing music. The genre would most likely be classified as indie-hardcore, but in rare cases, the music speaks for itself. This album speaks for itself. Track 11 'Silencer' is my personal favorite song of all time. Check it out, you wont regret it."
3,Yeah its ok,"I like mewithoutyou. I bought this album after hearing 'its all crazy, its all false...' This album is much different than that one. I think this one is a little more raw. Its good."
2,lack of worked examples,I found the book less attractive due to the lack of worked examples given. The book is of limited use for a person who is self studying and is dependent on the quesitons and the answers in order to improve the theoretical understanding.An excellently written theory book is of no use if the application of it is not sufficiently covered.
2,"Beauty magazine makes you look ugly, if you get my drift.","Beauty magazine makes you look ugly, if you get my drift.If a textbook has anything to deliver, it should explain, show and demonstrate to the reader the ideology, argument and conclusion of the topic at hand. I am unfortunate enough to own this book and it failed in all counts. In fact many of my college mate (at MSc level) get more confused AFTER reading this book. I would say pay less and get the Outline book series instead."
3,Not good at all,"Authors have the knack of throwing in suppossedly profound but obscure comments, probably to show the depth of their knowledge. Doesn't make a pleasant reading at all."
1,This book blows,"Title says it all. I'm a math graduate student in pure math, and this text is used for a graduate-level probability course in the applied math department. The text is imprecise and often uses phrases without ever defining them (e.g. ""sampling from a distribution""). I hate this book."
2,A poor choice for any class or self study,"I am using this book in a graduate level probability theory class and I cannot recommend it. It's text is often terse and examples are few. The solutions guide (One Thousand Exercises in Probability) is just as bad. Proofs are left to the reader or completed in one line without explanation, even in the solutions manual."
2,Not for beginners,"This may be a good reference book for probability but certainly IS NOT recommended for someone who is just starting out with the topic. There is not much explanation of theories or concepts, examples are few. The exercises appear useful but without a good chapter behind the exercises, the exercises by themselves are of no use. The accompanying 1000 exercises is also written in the same manner. There is very little attempt to go down to the level of a beginner student, the authors appear to be so deeply immersed in the subject that they have forgotten what it is like when you encounter it for the first time."
2,"Probably a good reference, not good for teaching","This book was not much help when it came to learning probability and random processes. Many of the concepts that are explained lack sufficient examples to drive home the ideas, topics are presented and the next topic is discussed. When examples were given, key points seemed to be omitted that would have helped to illustrate the example. I won't argue that this is a good book for reference because it seems you should have a good grounding in probability and random process theory before picking up this book."
1,frustrating and confusing,"This is among the most confusing and frustrating books I have ever been forced to use. The examples are useless. Problems in chapter 6 require material in chapter 8 to solve.If you already know everything in the book and need a reference, you *might* have some use for it, otherwise don't bother.Come to think of it, it's probably not even a good reference. You can't find anything because definitions are hidden in the text with nothing to help you find them easily. Topics are introduced several paragraphs before their heading appears, so you can't find the information you're looking for if you forget to look at stuff 6 paragraphs before the heading that it should be under."
3,A great reference book,"I am a first year graduate student majoring in applied math - Statistics. Although I majored in math in undergraduate and computer science, I have been away from academic for more than 25 years. Recently, I resumed my graduate study and taking a graduate level Probability Theory course. I found this book helpful in the way as a reference book, meaning a book that points you to the right areas, from which you may pursue more materials or books that will offer you more detailed explanation or suitable descriptions to your level and taste. I also purchased ""One thousands excercises"" from the same author. But I returned it because the solutions of the problems are too brief for me. However, I kept ""Probability and Random Processes"" because this book covers almost any topic you may encounter in probability discussion and serves me as an encyclopedia of Probability. If you need more examples or explanations, you will need a more descriptive or introduction book to help you out."
3,A Very Terse Treatment of Graduate Level Probability,"I was a bit surprised that this book was so terse, given the postive comments given by others. I would recommend having at least the Schaum's outline handy when reading this book, especially if you want to really understand the more basic concepts well. The authors don't make any effort to expand/expound upon the basic concepts of probability so that the student understands how to apply the ideas in the exercises. However, it would seem that the authors enjoy spending more time writing about the less mainstream ideas and topics encountered in this book.And the exercises....well forget it. Those exercises will take up your entire weekend as you struggle through them, and the answers given by the authors in their companion answer guide are not much help in enabling understanding of the material."
3,"Good material, dangerous to practice","While I do not really know weather or not master M.Chia is a real Daoist master, I do know that most of the techniques in this book take 15-20 years to learn, and only after fully mastering the standing meditation (1 hour daily), inner smile, microcosmic & macrocosmic orbit (after many years of hard daily training), you may start practicing the iron shirt (which is indeed not really necessary for a healthy life).Just for a simple example, a friend of mine, who bought this particular book and started practicing it without consulting his whushu teacher first, got some major breath disorder and lost his erection for a couple of months.The book indeed contains some interesting topics, worth reading, but be very careful and practice only under a supervision of an experienced master."
4,Danger Will Robinson! Stop Packing.,"A very valuable addition to the qi gong literature, this is the first book I've seen to reveal the Golden Tortoise exercise, which is the basis for iron shirt training. However, the book emphasizes ""qi packing."" This is one of the most dangerous techniques around. You can easily damage your kidneys, heart, and give yourself high blood pressure and other ailments. Qi packing is not necessary for iron shirt training. Still, I'm delighted someone described the method in print. Just don't try it unless you're under the guidance of a very cautious and knowledgeable teacher. Bottom line: buy the book and read it for its revelation of formerly secret training methods. But practice the techniques only under direct guidance of a master."
2,Not as good,"I am very sorry but although the author of this book has touched on an important component of life (the way to nurture life itself), his writing style is so poor and disorderly that it takes a lot to figure out what the heck he is trying to say. As from his other books, he seems to always forget that people will learn the concepts only FROM WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN. He lacks a sense of sequence in introducing details; some important details come ONLY LATER, after the element they pertain to has been covered. His English is not always easy to understand either; sometimes what he writes is very confusing. This, among other things, causes progess to be slow.Yes, he has some knowledge, but he needs to offer it in a format that can be grasped easily and without ambiguity!"
1,"Good materials, poorly organized","I cannot argue about the content, very useful and promising.Yet, I quit after spending exhausting weeks trying to extract useful information from this book (save to practice them). I made notes, summary etc., but the book is too poorly organized.My sugestion is to treat this book as encyclopedia only, learn from the master or other books. Back to this book only if you want to check some details."
2,Easy information for beginners,"This book is very difficult to follow, and the topics and information is difficultly organized in this book.It gives you the idea that this was meant to be longer than it ended up becoming. This can be seen with the continuity of thought throughout the book.As an owner of the book, I would recommend one of Yang Jwing-ming's books on chi-kung, or ""Qigong Empowerment"". I am afraid that this book works too much on elaboration of very simple nei gung (mind energy direction) than giving more useful information.Just as well this book is good for beginners though, and the book if you follow it will help you to achieve.Look forward to spending at least an hour every day or kiss iron shirt goodbye.So this is neither a good or a bad book, yet after a while of trining you will realize it is all in the mind and that is what the training is all about, 'improving neural connections for strength training'. (Paraphrase from ""Job's Body: a Handbook for body work"")"
4,Brakes,These are mountain bike breaks. Disc breaks are the way to go but if you are just building a bike to ride around these will work just fine. I say this is a good purchase for that. Other than that I wouldn't buy this product.
4,recommended to fans of the British gangster flick,"Chronologically sitting between Get Carter & The Long Good Friday this is something of a lost classic British gangster / heist film containing all the tough , gritty realism of its better known peers - with Stacy Keach ( for some reason ) cast as an alcoholic ex-London cop . Highly recommended to fans of the genre - bit dated otherwise but still stands up against more recent films."
5,Fine Crime Film,"This is one of the very great gangster movies. In British film it can be ranked with Get Carter and The Long Good Friday. Believe me it really is that good.Direction,plot,script,acting everything comes together. Making a harder than nails film. Tough with real and scary gangsters plus a career best cameo from Freddie Star. And an excellent starring role by Stacy Keach.These are not geezer gangsters of the Guy Ritchie variety.These are down dirty and very,very nasty. A great film"
3,You ask yourself . . .,"THE SQUEEZE causes you to ask yourself . . . ""Hey! I've been watching this for 25 minutes. Are they writing the script as they go along?"" It is almost as if the director conceded that since we're not getting any laughs, let's make this into a mystery. Failing that route, it ended up trying to make the kids happy with a lot of special effects. Yes, Keaton tried to play the comic, but only manages to play a misfit-in-society figure. I give three stars to this movie only because I did not fall asleep; and also because Rae Dawn Chong worked very hard to act out her role, whatever that was supposed to be. I saw this movie again after a spell of ten years hoping that I'd find something in it after that time lapse. I think that I did detect a New Yorker's joke about New Jersey on the second time around."
1,An awful read,"I have read ""Crosses"" and ""Tomorrow Wendy, A Love Story"" by Shelley Stoerh and loved them both, so when I bought ""Wannabe"" i expected it to be just as good if not better. Boy, was I in for a surprise. The book has no plot whatsoever and it is obviously coming from someone who has no experience with what the book is about. I do not recomment it to ANYONE! Shelley Stoehr is normally a great author, but ""Wannabe"" is one of the worst books I've ever read!"
3,Wannabe,I thought that in this book there was too much swaring and it was very depressing. I think that it was very unrealistic because you couldn't drop the cocane that fast.
1,"Unfortunately, you can't tell a book by its cover.",Parents need to know that this book contains obscene and sexually explicit language. Comments on the back cover compare this book to Robinson Crusoe and Gary Paulsen's Hatchet. This is hardly the case.
5,Life changing!,"It's a slim volume that offers a life-changing perspective. Believe it.I read this book at a time in my life when I needed to grow away from blaming myself and others and to capture a truer and more authentic self. We all live in closets...some self-constructed and others foisted upon us. In this book Chris Nutter helps the reader discover a higher order of thinking about life and the world beyond any construct, be it closet or condition.This is not a ""gay"" book...it's a book for everyone who needs or wants to discover the joy in fully realizing their full human potential. Nutter is honest, confronts injustice and lays it all out in such a way that the reader is empowered to follow his courageous path."
5,Out of the frying pan - into the fire,"The Way Out: The Gay Man's Guide to Freedom No Matter if You're in Denial, Closeted, Half In, Half Out, Just Out or Been Around the BlockChris Nutter has nailed the issue of gay men seeking liberation only to find themselves in yet another closet; not necessarily of their own conscious making.Nutter has written stuff that a lot of men need to know about to help them cope with this strange world. And gay men need his sorts of insights more than others.This is one of those books that I've bought for my friends. I'm waiting for his next work."
5,Great book for the new Silky owner!,Good book for any Silky owner. One of the latest and uptodate books on the subject. Gives info on grooming and all the particulars as well as possible health problems.
4,It works fine,This is a standard size bread box that holds only one loaf of bread. I was originally looking for something a little larger and made of bamboo but when that didn't work out I ordered this one. The flip top works fine and stays on track (which was the problem with the bamboo one that I had at first). It's okay and it holds the loaf of bread but I'm not ecstatic over it. I will probably eventually replace this with a larger bread box.
4,Good !! But please keep reading on the subject !!!,"Good Book. Read it back in 1995. Thought it was one of the best until i kept reading. Some other titles : Shotgunning by Brister, The sporting clays handbook by Meyer, Sporting Clays by Atwill, Precision shooting by Russel ."
3,Good Range shooting guide,"I know at the range we call our clays ""birds"" but I thought the title was a little misleading. The book is very helpful for range work and ""taking more clays"" but was disappointed when I found only a small section indicating that the technique would be helpful in the field. Upland bird hunting is considerably different than range shooting and those differences deserve much more attention than this book provides."
4,rachid taha,"I was lucky to see Rachid Taha in concert in Brussels and he truly truly rocks. He had the whole crowd dancing to his amazing mixture of north african/arabic rythyms at a north american rock intensity. I'd never heard anything like it and promptly boughtic two of his cds: this one and Made in Medina. Of the two, Made in Medina has kept my attention longer because it has more energy (if you've seen Black Hawk Down, the song Barra Barra accompanies the helicopters to the city). My favourite song on this album is Ya Rayah (a big hit in Europe) because it always makes me want to get up and belly dance. The other songs are a bit softer or mellower than Made in Medina, but still have an edge. All the songs are in Arabic, French, or both. If you'd like something out of the ordinary, and not sappy boring ""world music"" or mushy euro-pop, then you'll love Rachid Taha."
1,Not what I thought,The disc I received after ordering this item was not made by Rachid Taha. In fact it wasn't even remotely like him. I suspect the website gremlins got to this one!
2,Ya Rayah fans beware!,"I bought this particular album on the strength of one song - Ya rayah, which I just love. I learned that it was the only song not written and composed by Rachid Taha which explains my disapointment. The other tracks are much different - more ""dance tracks"". So, be forewarned."
5,"Nice quality, good fabric",I was happy to see that the fabric used in this shirt was of good quality and soft and comfortable and not some of the heavy and rough fabric that I've found in some of the sporting goods stores in my area. Price and quality was better online. Very happy.
1,Not what I ordered.,I ordered the breakout pattern and was sent the mossy oak pattern.So don't think just because you order one thing that you will get it.
4,Good shirt,The shirt is a shirt. There isn't really anything special about it. I would probably just been your one from the local walmart next time.
4,Vibrant color,"I had ordered a large, but they were sold out. I settled for a medium and luckily they were made big so it worked out"
1,poor quality,I was dissapointed with the quality of the stitching. Ther were places on the sleeve that did not get any stitching.I had my wife sew the sleeve .
4,Slim fit,"I bought this to wear under waders in the early stages of the duck hunting season. It's not very stretchy for 100 percent cotton, and the fit is somewhat slim, and while reducing bulk is good for wear with waders, it doesn't leave much room for a base layer. Also, the neck opening is a bit tight, but I am almost between a 2XL and 3XL (which was not available)."
5,What a Soundtrack!!,"First, I love the movie. The story behind is really exciting and full of contents. There's passion, anger, emotion....It really made me think! Leo is at the top in this movie!When I bought this soundtrack I did not expect such a great score. As someone else before said this is not a ""relaxing"" score....this is is a compilation of songs which make you move your mind and think about life.Enrico"
2,No Comment!!!,"Que dire d'autre? De plus?La musique est tout simplement magnifique, elle mme et a une vitesse... elle vous replonge d'un seul coup au 19eme siècle ainsi quand dans le merveilleux film Rimbaud-Verlaine (Total Eclipse)Bravo tout simplement M. Kaczmarek."
4,Great Reading,"In spite of being at the Russian front with incompetent leaders and a corrupt system, Sergeant Asch overcomes the obstacles put in his way and manages to take care of his troops. To understand the mindset of Asch I recommend reading his books in the order that they were published. Hans Hellmut Kirst provides a good series that lets the reader know that even under the Nazism there were those that hated it and found ways to undermine the military system."
3,Fasinating study,I disagree with the above reviews that this is a work of 'fiction'. The author tries and i think suceeds in showing some of the hypocresy of Alexander Hamilton. He makes no attempt at 'explaning' the motivations of Aaron Burr. What he does do is write about two complex men who's destiny's seemed preordained. I would have rated this work a four star rating if only the author hadn't 'overwritten' parts of the book. I still recomend it as a 'fair' look at two historic people.
2,An Historical Embellishment ...,"Although a mildly useful work, the author seems content to conclude that a simpleton argument is the underlying reason for the two men's duel and fails to disclose perhaps the most revealing, yet little-known fact of all surrounding this most famous event -- that in 1804 Alexander Hamilton had exposed political moves by Vice President Burr, Jr. and Burr's cousin, Theodore Dwight, among others, ultimately designed to return the United States back to British rule. Like so many others here, I rate this book in the category of ""mostly fiction""."
1,This book was a huge lie,"The author of this book was no historian, just a man with an idea. When he tried to find proof that Alexander was the bad guy, he could not. He then decided to come up with as much falsified and non-backed evidence that he could. I found this FAIRY-TALE quite comical because of all the mis-directing lies. It was almost as if Bill Clinton had written it."
3,Review with a German and Lutheran focus,"This is both a German-centered, and a Lutheran-centered tour of the field. It is more focused on those who wrote about the nature of interpretation, rather than those who produced commentaries on books of the Bible.""Can the church live with Historical Criticism?"" That question, posed at the beginning is one that the book explores, but not in any shrill or light fashion. ""We believe that what is needed is a confessionally critical history of modern biblical criticism"" meaning an analysis that is ""seeking to be responsible to the church and its dogmatic tradition."" In the hands of those with less integrity this could lead to fundamentalism or to appeals to authority. Here it leads to a balanced, careful work."
3,Ok phone with some problems,"The phone works fine. The sound quality is good, and the range has never been a problem for us in and around a two story home. The voicemail indicator is an important feature if you use a voicemail service. It detects the stutter tone and lights up both handsets and the base. The intercom feature is really useful if you keep a phone in the garage or other remote location.Cons: The remote charging station died within a few weeks and won't charge. Also, the ""3 new calls"" indicator is a bit wonky. It pretty much always indicates new calls, and scrolling through the list of calls doesn't reset it."
3,A bit slow...,"After watching the exciting preview on another of my anime DVDs,I was slightly disappointed at how slow these first episodes moved. This DVD is mainly there to set up the story; it is like a 5-episode introduction. There were far fewer fight scenes than I expected; most of the episodes are taken up with Kyouta becoming a professional musician, with only tantalizing seconds of supernatural battle sequences. However, this DVD has some of the most beautiful colors I have seen, and I love the battle music. I got a little tired of the song ""Prism,"" which was played at such frequency as to become slightly annoying (but then, I have a very short attention span.) In summary, I recommend this DVD to all who are patient because the idea of it is very cool. I plan to buy the next DVDs in the series, because in spite of myself, I am desperate to know what happens next :)."
2,Very Let Down,"Honestly after seeing the trailer I was looking for a thrilling action packed anime.This was not what I received. The anime was slow (which could have been ok), unclear and confusing. The characters relationships were not clear at all. I had no idea what was going on. I watched it twice thinking I might have missed something (I didn't). It was dull and I was bored. Very unhappy with this waste of my money. The artwork was beautiful and the animation was well done though."
3,the slow age,"Five supernatural factions have been fighting against each other for who knows how many centuries, with the beginning of Aquarian Age always in mind."
5,CLEAR HIGHLAND TAPES THE BEST!,THIS IS THE BEST FOR TRANSPARENT TAPE. YOU CAN SEE THROUGH IT WITH NO FOGGY LOOK. IT'S TUFF AND GREAT FOR PHOTOS AND ESPECIALLY FOR WRAPPING PRESENTS AT CHRISTMAS TIME!VERY CLEAR CAN'T TELL IT'S THERE!
3,DVD EXTRA SUCKS,"I was very impressed with the CD but very dispointed with the DVD. Their was no stand up on it, liked advertised and it wasnt that funny."
1,Totally overrated,"I don't know what people see in dane cook, he's just not funny. Most of his jokes are something that a 4 yr old could come up with or they just don't make any sense at all. I'm sure dane might be a nice guy, but he sucks as a comedian."
4,A Decent Comedy Album,"I've been listening to Dane Cook from back in the days when you could download music illegally on Napster! I've watched this guy rise through the ranks and I must say that he has fallen off a little. I much prefer his older material to the jokes on this CD, but perhaps I'm being a bit to critical. This CD does have its memorable jokes and its forgettable ones. Sometimes it seemed like there was filler material on here. Those who have listened to Dane Cook are extremely polarized, they either love his delivery or hate it. I happen to like it so i think this CD is still very good. In my opinion, the comedian with the best delivery is Daniel Tosh. His non-sequeters and random remarks are extremely hilarious."
5,"Yep, Dane is still awesome","Dane Cook's ""Harmful if Swallowed"" is one of the funniest comedy routines I have ever heard. I didn't think ""Retaliation"" could top it--but it did. Although this routine is more adult in content, Dane's style has more of a chance to impress with the 3 disc format. The type of thing that has made him a star is present in abundance--both pertinent observations on the funnier aspects of life, and some flights of fancy. This CD is hilarious in every aspect of the word, and is a must-buy for anyone who likes to laugh (and who doesn't?)"
3,Not what I was expecting...,"I LOVE Dane, he's absolutely hands-down my favorite comedian, but this CD/DVD was a real let down. The DVD is mostly clips culled from small comedy central appearences, many of which are from Crank Yankers, which were not really funny at all because it's not truly Dane. As mentioned by a previous reviewer his stand up accounts for maybe 20 minutes of the DVD. The CD was OK, but seemed to be lacking something. All in all, Retaliation felt more like a teaser or a filler to make his fans happy while he wraps up Tourgasm and gets that out on DVD."
4,Dane Cook is Hilarious,"I bought this cd/dvd combo because I owned Dane Cooks ""Harmful if Swallowed"" and love his style. Although I was a bit disappointed that the only features on the dvd were snippets from other shows I am glad they put them on there, however I was expected a longer stage performance. I will say this though I enjoy both cd and dvd and would recommend for a Dane Cook fan or anyone who loves to laugh. I laughed so hard I cried and couldn't breathe which is my kind of comedy!! SU-FI!!"
5,Excellent Product & Prompt Delivery,This item was exactly as described in the item description. It was in the original packaging and is in excellent condition. I am very satisfied and I highly recommend this seller and product to everyone. Dane Cook is hilarious and I highly recommend this DVD.
4,A Different Kind of Humor,"If you're new to Dane Cook, his style of humor is one that is more random and animated. If you're looking for light-hearted, safe, transitional, chuckle ha ha humor, you won't find it here. Some nostalgic humor is here, but it caters very much to the younger generation. I saw Dane Cook live, and the majority of the crowd consisted of college students and people under the age of 30. Not exactly because his material is very offensive or controversial, but because older generations probably wouldn't get most of his humor if they haven't kept up with the times. This is definitely comedy for younger people, but if you're open to new things and are easily humored, then check this out - it's very funny in it's own unique way."
3,DC a comic genius? Now that's funny!,"This set has it's moments, you get one show on each disc -- a sweet deal for the price. His jokes about relationships are pretty good. My wife thinks he's hilarious, and Dane gets her thinking about things I'd like her to think about doing with me. And that's useful. The dude's funny, but way too overrated."
4,"funny, but profane","Dane is hilarious, I have to give him that. His material is funny, and then when he laughs at it himself, it makes you laugh even harder because his LAUGH is even funny. However, some of his material is rather graphic and uncalled for, and the explicit language/profanity makes me wish he could tone it down a bit. Brian Regan is my favorite comic, and it is pretty obvious that Dane is familiar with him, because he mimics him at times. The difference between the two (Dane isn't any funnier) is that Brian manages to keep it clean, yet he still ""kills"". Dane does good comedy, but it's definitely R-rated.In closing, I wouldn't recommend listening to this CD while driving. First of all, it could cause you to laugh so hard that you lose control, and second of all, when you reach your destination you will have deep laugh lines around your mouth. :)"
2,About 20 mins worth of funny stuff...,"and the rest is just filler. I think Dane's halarious, but this CD honestly had me nodding off. A lot of the jokes were so drawn out and boring that by the end, you forget how it started, and therefore don't get the punchline (upon repeated listening, it wasn't that funny anyway). It's really a shame to have so much of Dane and so little of it be funny. Stick with ""Harmful"" and download some of his better stuff."
2,Somewhat Ok...,I liked the first album better. This one stayed on the same subject too long... and the bonus DVD was a complete wash out.
2,Underwhelming,I recently picked this up and was surprised how weak it was.Cook's an energetic enough performer but not a very interesting writer. His setups are too long for so-so payoffs.Listen to the audience on these discs - not a lot laughs per minute ratio. Comedy is a very subjective taste but I recommend checking out Mitch Hedberg or Dmitri Martin instead.
3,Retaliation,"To really enjoy Dane Cook you have to see him perform the act. Just listening to him is good but you need to see him in action. I said it before, ill say it again."
5,Hilarious,"""Retaliation"" was my introduction to the menacing humor of Dane Cook, so reports of Cook being a physical comedian didn't effect me so much. He does a great job of creating visuals in the audio version of his rambunctious routines, so I highly recommend this if you have not seen Dane Cook before. Only after I caught a bit of his stand-up performance in a Comedy Central special (in which he used the same material) did I realize just how much I was missing and made me wonder, ""Where the F*** is the DVD?????"""
3,"Not brilliant, but has his moments","You know those really annoying, loud, raucous jocks/frat boys that you knew in college or high school who prayed openly to the God of Attention and seemed to get all the girls you couldn't? Well, you'd be a fool not to admit those guys definitely could make you laugh at times.This is Dane Cook's routine. A loud and boisterous 30 something frat boy who occasionally is damn good at what he does(The reference to Tekken 3 made me smile). The guy has plenty of energy which is a plus, but his shtick does wear itself out after a while. This guy isn't so much of a social commentary comedian like Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks(my personal favorites). Rather, he's the loud guy who came over to your domitory with a case full of beer and goofy grin.Not amazing, but not unfunny. You should check out his classic Tom Cruise impression as well"
4,Bust a gut funny...,"this 2 CD and single DVD set is great.. constant laughs with new skits and materials... i am subscribed to dane's page on myspace and i bought this the first day it came out... best 15 bucks i spent in my life...my only gripe, there was not more on the DVD... i would have rather seen dane on stage acting out the skits than cartoon acting..."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Dane Cook is not very funny and noticably imitates Mitch Hedberg in the way he phrases things. Most of his material involves describing scenarios that would be funny to witness, but don't amount to much when presented as observations. At one point he even comments on how memorable it would be to push a random kid's ice-cream into his face or s#%& on everyones coats in the coatroom at a party, to which the audience responds with uproarious laughter. There's no punchline, that's just it. This is what passes for clever observations? I don't think Comedy Central have ever put a significant foot wrong in anything they've released/produced before, but this is some seriously D grade comedy. I'd be hard pressed to think of any internationally known comedian whose material isn't better than this. Do yourself a favor and pick up Maria Bamford's The Burning Bridges Tour cd instead."
4,Cool!,"I thought this cd was cool. He is really great in person. The dvd could have had a full length show like the last one, but the content was good anyway. Buy it!"
3,Good but not a classic,"I know some people are big marks for Dane Cook and some will find in ghastly if I don't say the man is a genius ... well, sorry, he isn't. Do not get me wrong, his albums are entertaining. There are spots that are quite brilliant. Two of my favorite Dane bits are on car alarms and The Kool-Aid Man. That is some riotous stuff.But the key to Dane's performances are his energy and frankly, HEARING him isn't quite the same as SEEING him. Some commedians it really doesn't matter, but with Dane Cook, losing the visual element hurts.Here's the key: IF your interest is in TOP NOTCH WRITING then Dane Cook simply is not up there. He's a skilled performer, he can be a good story teller but as far as WRITING goes he's simply not up there with the likes of Todd Barry or Mitch Hedburg.Something about Dane Cook has obviously connected with A LOT of people. As for me, yeah, I enjoy him but not as much as others.And yes, he can be needlessly vulgar."
1,Terrible,"I'm absolutey dumbfounded as to why this guy has a thriving career...he really is terrible. I agree that he is one of those comics that just does the whole ""has this ever happened to you..."" and just animates everything buy jumping up and down. NOT FUNNY! If you've seen seen the MAD TV spoof on him, you'd realize just how much of a joke this guy's act is. Mindless garbage on a CD. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
2,"Wow, this CD sucks.","I've heard a lot of comedy CD's in my time, but this one takes the cake, the frosting, the ice cream, and the birthday party for being one of the worst. Cook's not funny. He's not. And if you think he is, you're probably really insecure, or one of those people who likes to run around and quote television shows. ""Hey, have you heard this one?!""He's got nothing more to offer since his last CD. Same excited delivery, same tired, boring material. Cook writes comedy to get himself laid. And this was his last hurrah. Teenyboppers and people will be over him in the next three years.The reviews for this CD are funnier than the CD. OMG, liek, he's the best comedian eva! SU-FI! Five stars!"
5,"Hey, as long as none of it is on my coat!",Great set from the ever hystercal Sir Dane of Cook.Perfect intro for new fans and has all his classics for the die hards.Great value for what you get.
3,it was alright,I thought dane's last dvd was better. His audio cds are still really funny but when I got to the dvd I was disappointed there was only about 20 mins. of his stand up and some other stuff. I was hoping to see more of him. Whats on there is still funny. But id borrow it from a friend instead of buying it.
3,"good and funny, but not as good as last","I enjoyed listening to the large amount of comedy on this album, but I would have to say that the last cd was better. It does give some hilarious moments, but I also found some moments that seem to be kinda of dead. The last cd, although shorter, seemed to be more intense, even causing me to pull the car over while driving.Dane Cook is a huge hit in the college crowd, and this age group seems to be his target audience. I would recomend this cd to any friends, but would think that they would be better off checking out the previous one first, espically since he makes some references to it."
5,Dane Cook yet again...,"Dane Cook is one of the most recognized new comedians of this year. His new release of 'Retaliation' is yet another genius performance to add to his reputation. His form of delivery and hyperactive performance is just an addition to his act that will leave you literally crying from laughter. Dane takes everyday situations and turns it into the most ridiculous and hysterical things in the world. This CD is the best comic performance that I have ever heard. Honestly, I would pay alot more than what is offered and it is worth every penny. If I could rate this higher, I would!"
5,So f'ing hilarious!,"This cd/dvd collection is by far one of the best comedy cds I've ever heard. I think the funniest things on the cd are the sh*tting on the coats, the car alarm, and the tarantino style story. This is quality goods if you enjoy raw honest humor - this guy talks about stuff that you normally think all the time, but never have the nerve to say out loud. Enjoy!"
4,Good Book to Improve Your Chess Knowledge,"I am mostly a casual player, but want to improve my game, especially the strategy part. I am only part way through this book, but I found the categorization of the various strategies and the exercises that were provided to be very useful. I have various other (older) chess books, but this is the first time I have seen this approach and I found it very effective.This book will help even beginners, but the biggest help is going to be for intermediate level players. The author avoids a lot of ""technical"" sounding analysis and focuses on the basics - again, this is in the initial sections. The latter parts may be more complex, but I am yet to come to those.The reason for 4 stars is the quality of the paper and binding. It is pretty sad - I can see this book falling apart with even a moderate amount of usage. It would be ideal to get this book in ebook form, especially if there is a way to do the exercises and challenges within the book itself."
5,"wide selection of topics, a real bargain!","I think Mr Burgess has done a great job by doing this book a very readable and it's a small inexpensive paperback, so I like to have it when travelling. It's suitable, in my opinion, for 'intermediate' beginners, having nice exercises: mates in two, combinations etc.(although I think they are a little bit too difficult in comparison to mate exercises. but they are taken from real matches, and could anybody say finding combinations with no refute is easy?!). this books contains a lot of opening info with traps and strategic play examples. Besides there is coverage of chess-related topics which you could probably not find in most of books.Get the book, you'll love it."
3,Label printer case,"This case is really big, much larger than I thought it would be. It didn't fit the label maker I bought it for, but I have three other Brother label printers, so one of them will probably fit. There is a slot inside for the label maker and foam cutouts for accessories. The case is a nice way to keep the supplies together and out of the way. I only give it three stars because I think it is kind of ugly and overpriced for a hunk of plastic and some foam. This is no Pelican case. Even so, I will eventually be buying another one when I find the right one for the label maker I had intended to keep in this case. (I will check the Brother website first this time, and get the proper item number.)Edited to add: As I mentioned, I did have other Brother label printers than the one I'd hoped would fit in this case. It fits perfectly the model number PT-1950. Surely it fits others too, but if you have that model, this case is the right one."
2,Paint rubbery,Wish I could say that this product was great but when I opened the paint colors they were all rubbery and would not mix or spread easily!
1,Disaster,"This product was an absolute disaster.I had a huge hole in my leather couch, which this product describes how to put a subpatch and glue the pieces together- except that the glue was old and putty-like; it would not hold anything together!Secondly, although it claims to tell you how to combine the basic colors to get any color in the world, its a very basic description - like, tan is a combination of yellow, orange, white and brown. this resulted in a salmon colored liquid when i tried to make tan.Anyhow, in desperation to get my couch not to continue to rip, I took out a needle and thread and sewed it together. Also now have salmon colored streaks on that cushion, which is not pretty.I returned the product for a full refund."
3,Matching color is a little tricky,"Tried this product to repair a restaurant booth that got several very small tears from a broken window. Matching the exact ""red"" of the booth seemed easy enough, however, when I came back to work on it again, the color didn't match as well as it seemed originally. Also, use the sandpaper very sparingly. I think the repair would have looked more inconspicuous had I not used the sandpaper at all. In Leather Magic's defense....I have little patience for this kind of thing and it probably takes more time to really get it right."
3,"Works, but only for tiny repairs - too messy","Just too messy for anything over 1"". Very binding, but very messy - not an even finish for anything over 1"" in size. Also, not for smooth leather."
2,Not for small holes,"I bought this product to try to fix and conceal several small holes in my car's leather seating. It really did a pretty poor job. The holes are still pretty noticable. I was able to get a good color match. I also tried the product on some minor scratches on a leather chair. That application worked much better. Overall, the product is probably better suited for scratches than holes or rips. And make sure to go light on your colors, because you don't have much white to play around with to lighten your mixture up. You will also need many more alcohol wipes than are provided in the kit."
2,Does not repair leather,"The past reviewer was correct, if you have a large rip, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, unless you want everybody to know where the rip is as it show up even worse.Would not recommend this product at all."
1,Should be called box o junk,"Ok I was allready to go with this stuff.... then I tried to use the adhesive, it got jammed as I was squeezing it out, so I popped off the little nozzle and applied through the larger hole in the jug, then the whole jug of adhesive got hard. There goes the adhesive... so I used some of my own adhesive... right now I am letting the leather patch dry but i am not hopeful, waste of $30.00 use that money for somebody to fix it for real"
4,it did the job,"had an 'L' shaped tear on seat cushion of my couch, maybe 4"" long. figured i would need a kit that was better than average given the size and shape of the tear. the item is as described, including more than enough fill to do multiple jobs. it could use more underlayment, but seems like you could use almost any cloth as such for future repairs. my couch is dark brown so color matching was quite simple. the most challenging aspect is prepping the tear, getting the tear to line up, and then holding it long enough for the glue to dry. kit includes one rubbing alcohol swab. not nearly enough for the whole job considering you clean the surface before applying the fill and can use it to smooth the fill between coats. and as posted by another, multiple coats are the way to go. i did not use the 2"" sq. patch included."
4,Worthwhile,Repaired a tear and touched up a few nicks. Saved me from buying a new sofa. I wish I would have matched the color a little better. That was my fault though. I was too impatient and used up all the white so i couldn't lighten the color more. Also touched up my black leather car seats. Black is easy no mixing.
5,Worked as well as could be expected,"I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect patch kit, then gave up and decided to start cheap (this one). It worked perfectly. Yes, you can tell there was once a hole if you look very carefully, but nobody is going to casually notice it. My couch is black so the color matching wasn't a problem. I imagine light colored leather, such as beige or brown would be quite difficult to match with this kit."
2,leather repair kit by leather magic,"didnt like it at all. just used it once on my leather couch. after using it, the leather got harder and started ripping more. I will never recommend this product."
5,Awesome product - would buy again,"we have a 6 year old leather couch that had worn on one cushion and a 3""x3"" hole had formed. It really needs to be reupholstered, but I don't have the funds for that right now. I bought this kit instead for a fix.I was super worried about using it because I'm not a DIY person and had never done a repair like this, but the instructions were so simple and the patch looks good. I'm not going to lie and say it isn't noticeable, but compared to the hole that was there before - this is a dream!"
4,Inexpensive leather repair,"This product works well when you follow the instructions, but it takes some patience. I accidentally oversanded the area I was repairing, which could have made the leather look worse, but the leather conditioner included in the kit seems to have fixed it. I was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair, and I think this repair won't be noticeable, as the damage is lower on a chair leg. Take the time to mix the color to match the leather, do the repairs in daylight, and be careful to keep the mixture as close to the damaged areas as possible when applying, and it works pretty well!"
1,BEWARE,"If you have a rip of any size in your leather I would not recomend this. The product says it repairs smaller rips, I had a quarter inch rip in my couch and followed the instructions provided and only accomplished one thing making sure everyone knows about the rip now. I would recomend looking for a professional to repair any expensive piece of leather."
4,Worked good,I was repairing a hole in sleeve of school varsity jacket. For my first time using a product like this it worked good. I spent considerable amt of time getting the color to match but finally got an exact match (yellow/gold/brown)
4,Works well,This product works well in repairing ripped or damaged leather. We used it on our ivory-color leather couch and also a black leather jacket. The only thing is that it already comes with glue so no need to buy a separate liquid leather stitch.
3,It worked,Does not have an awful lot of product to it but it will be plenty to cover a 1ftx1ft area. If you need more than this I suggest something else.
4,Good for what it is,"I bought this kit because I got a small tear in an expensive designer jacket. The trick to this stuff works to the best ability is A. a spot that can be blended, B. on non textured leather, C. a reasonable repair (Don't expect miracles). My jacket is black calfskin and very soft, very smooth, very fragile. I repaired it and you can't notice a problem unless I tell you about it. The jacket was a $2,000 John Varvatos and I trust this stuff on it. It will do just fine!"
1,Rip off,The book is tiny - around 6inches by 4. It is very old (first published 1999. the author keeps referring to such cutting edge technology as the Atari!) and a little too basic and generic for my use.
5,This was made for X-box's only,"I have read the other reviews for this xbox cable and most of them act like this is a rip off, and you should just buy a 50foot ""cross-over"" cable. THIS CABLE IS MADE FOR LINKING TWO XBOX'S TOGETHER! NOT FOR ANY OTHER USES! And using a ""50 foot crossed over cable"" doesn't work anyways. I bought one myself tried using it and no, it didn't work. That is because it was not specifically designed for the xbox. This cable however is made for xboxes, and will connect 2 xbox systems together so you can play certain games with up to 8 players on two different TV's, but still be fighting each other. But the ultimate recommendation would be to just get x-box live, that way there's no complaining about a system link that will only do what the package says it does(link 2 xbox systems together) and you can play more than 8 people whenever you want.PS-i'm not a kid, i just didn't want to sign up with amazon."
1,XBox System Link Cable Questions,"What is the purpose for a system link cable? Can I use this cable to transfer ""saved games"" from one XBox to another? What if I purchase a new Xbox. Can I then transfer to the new XBox using this system link cable?"
3,Research Study Guide Comments,"The book complements the textbook by the same authors. It is okay for more advanced students, but not useful as an undergraduate textbook."
2,Was ok,I bought this book to help me with my class. There were some helpful items in there. But most things were in the form of crossword puzzles - who feels like doing that! So I ended not really this book much before my final. I don't think it help me to better comprehend the material
1,"Very bad book, don't buy it","DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, PLEASE. I have to say this study guide is completely useless for my course. Its all about cross words exercise and absolutely nothing to help to prepare your examination or essay. The only thing worth buying this book is the CD, at least there are normal questions there for you to try it on. However, a lot of exercise there have NO ANSWER. It seems lost the plot for student revision, because you don't know you are in the right direction or not."
3,No More than the book,"This covers the material in the book in a less intimidating way, but th e accompanying book sucks, so how much more can you get out of a review or study guide? It's really a bunch of crossword puzzles. OOOOOOooooookkkkkk. Can we get a little more creative people?"
4,everyone's guide,"Having no evidence to go on besides the title I was unsure if this book would meet my purpose. I teach DTP and marketing to voluntary and community organisations.I was pleased with the amount of information in the book and the well organised layout.I would, however have appreciated some colour, particularly in the chapter called 'color that works'.I thought the checklists were a great idea and will certainly encourage my students to start producing their own.With the popularity of computerised Desk Top Publishing, perhaps the next version of the book should have a bigger section on this."
4,Schenker Missed Out...,"This is a very solid, complete effort from the UF portion of UFO. Muddy's Gold, Jerusalem, Whip That Groove, and Last Man in Space are very well sung & well played by the group. This is one of those albums that you wish had 12 or 13 songs on it. Cover art isn't too bad either. Although I think Force It had the best cover."
4,Moog and Way Continue to Rock,I was always a big fan of UFO. Thought they made some awesome rock 'n' roll in their day. From what I've learned from other Moog/Way CD's they must have been two of the main driving forces of that band. Hopefully they will continue to collaborate on new music in the future. I for one will be standing in line waiting.
4,How Sweet it is!,"4 1/2 Stars = Minor MasterpiecePhil Moog & Pete Way with this album trumped many of the newer UFO albums (probably all!), & is a true UFO album in the sense of song writing, that is sharp, metallic, & quick to the point, this album just cuts it through out it's entire length!One of the best albums I've heard from 70's heavy metal icons or dinosaurs, as some with no respect for the major talents of the 70's would say, but cut it anyway you like, this album rocks! The first two songs, ""Muddy's Gold"" & ""Jerusalem,"" could've of been on any classic 70's UFO disc, & the others are not far behind!If you love UFO, then this is a must! Get it before its price rises, & it will!"
4,ufo without the name,"This is a very good cd.Jeff kollman does a good job,although he is no michael schenker but who is.If you like u.f.o you will like this cd."
4,Shapes On Board-So Cute,My baby grandson loves looking at and talking to his shapes on board as they hang on his car seat/carrier handle. Nice toys!
5,YES!!,"I had this inside my filter for my 3 gallon REEF tank! It kept my water from 75-80 degrees F. It is very reliable and it was able to sustain a reef tank! Yes, saltwater. A must for all small tanks!"
1,hydor mini heater,I should have saved the pkging and returned this heater when it wouldn't heat up 1 gallon of water. It was a waste of money.
1,"Bought Two from Amazon, Did Not Work for Me","Like the last review said, some work some don't. Apparently the two I went through didn't work. No temperature change and it wasn't warm at all. This was for a 2.5 Gallon Bowl by the way.Amazon was nice and processed the refund for me no problem. I do not recommend this heater and you should pay $2 more for the other ones."
4,Good heater,I live in Colorado so my room can get really cold but this is a great way to off set the chill for my betta. Sometimes it does get too warm but it corrects itself and only use it in the winter or a cold room. Unplug during summer and you'll be fine.
5,Great Product!,"Works wonderfully for my 1.5 gallon tank. Keeps my water just under 80 degrees to keep my Betta fish healthy. I highly recommend it. It hangs on the inside, or you can hide it under the rocks. I bought one for my sister's tank as well. Amazing find!"
2,MINI HEATER Aquarium Heater 7.5W for Tanks up to 5 Gallons UL,"This heater doesn't hold the temperature even in 2.5 gallon tank. My betta fish was always in the cold water. The temperature didn't rise even to 78F.I am very unhappy with this product. It was OK for 1 week then the heater was cold itself. I don't know why it stopped heating, maybe it broke."
1,"Great at first,not so great later","Bought 3 of these last year. At first they did a good job of keeping my betta bowls warm. However, one quit working altogether, the other 2 are steadily ""winding down"". Now barely create any warmth at all. Will not purchase again."
3,Hydor Heater 7.5w,I purchased 4 of these to go in my betta bowls. I have two 2.5 gallon bowls and two 1 gallon bowls. These heaters do a great job in my 1 gallons but just ok in my 2.5 gallons. The temp usually stays about 78 in the 1 gallons. In the 2.5 gallons it stayed about 72. I ended up purchasing slightly stronger wattage heaters for my 2.5 gallons and the temp is now them is now 79. Theres no way just one of these could heat a 5 gallon tank.
4,for my betta tank,"i have a betta in a smaller 1 gal tank and this heater does more than a great job in heating the water.it doesn't have an on/off switch and although it claims to shut off by itself, i've had to unplug/plug it multiple times to keep it from being too hot/too cold.it's tedious, but not much of a problem."
1,Broke after three days of use.,"The heater developed a little star-shaped crack in the middle, and it ceased working after only three days of use."
1,NOT WORKING,"This mini heater not working at all, it cannot even increase just one degree. the tank is about 3 Gallon."
4,Works great in 1 gallon aquarium!,"I know it isn't advertised for small aquariums, but it's great! My betta is super happy now, there are bubbles EVERYWHERE!"
1,Dont waste your money,Just buy a better heater. This one seems like a good deal but I've had mine for only three months and it no longer works.. at all. Besides it doesnt have any type of temp control or automatic shut off.
4,"Good heater, 1 gallon or more","I use this for a 1 gallon fishbowl, and it keeps my betta around 80 to 84, which is on the high end for this type of fish. Actually it only gets to 84 when the water level drops (when I siphon suction out the crap) if I forget to unplug it before my weekly cleaning.Otherwise it's a steady 80. Warm, but not uncomfortable."
1,stopped working within 2 months,"i recently got a Betta fish and needed a small heater to keep him warm. this little heater seemed perfect for the small tank. the heater was working fine and keeping the water temperature at just the right level, but it broke within 2 months. I'm not sure how this happened but while the heater was submerged in the water it somehow splayed the plastic cover so much so that the embedded heating element became visible. I don't know much about electricity but I know that it, water and living animals don't mix, so I ended up purchasing another brand of heater for Alpha out of fear of accidentally electrocuting my little buddy."
4,Off label use: 1.8 gallon tank,"I use this to heat a 1.8 gallon tank for my betta fish. Ever since I started heating his tank at night, he has been more active compared to the sluggish mornings when the water temp. was around 72. The box says it is meant for 2-5 gallons, so far no issues with over heating or insufficient heat and I've been using it for about a month. The first night I used it, I actually got up throughout the night to make sure it wasn't over heating the water, but it keeps it at a toasty 78-82(any higher and I unplug it immediately). The temperature range of my room is around 73 +/- 3 degrees throughout the day. On warmer days I highly recommend unplugging it! The size and flexible shape is convenient. I have a curved glass bowl and it forms nicely against the bowl taking up little space. It does not have an auto shutoff mechanism, so be sure to monitor it for a day or two before leaving it in there for long term use. Also this was very inexpensive."
1,Doesn't work at all,"I bought one for my 5 gallon frog tank and either mine is defective or it's a poor heater. Either way, it failed to change the temperature of my tank water by even one degree. Putting my finger next to it, I feel no heat at all. It was inexpensive, though, and I guess you get what you pay for. I would suggest you save the $10 and skip this one."
1,Great idea for little tanks,These little heaters are a good idea but mine were defective and cracked opened exposing the heating element and wires. The problem was handled swiftly and I will continue to do business with the seller.
1,this product helped kill my fish,"First of all, this ""heater"" doesn't even have a temperature control or attached thermometer.......so while we trusted it was doing what is should do, apparently it was slowly cooking my poor fish, we only realized this after the fish died and we couldn't figure out why until we tested the water temperature and it was over 85 degrees!! We have another fish and the only differences are that we took out his heater and stopped feeding him so much and he looks like a new fish!!! While I truly cannot blame the heater - I know in my heart it was part of my fishes death - my thought is inferior product -"
3,Might not be enough for 5 gallons.,"Under ideal surrounding temperature this might work perfectly for the advertised maximum 5 gallons, but in general this heater seems to fluctuate. In the warmer season in hot areas, this heater goes well above the green zone of many tank thermometers, which is about 80F. That may or may not be a problem depending on the fish species. The problem is in cold season it may not be enough, again, depending on the fish. I suppose people are less likely to have such sensitive fish in smaller tanks that a dip well below 80 might affect, but even with any tropical fish on the average, let's say your home heater breaks for a day and you're wearing coats indoors. Your fish might kick the bucket or at least get sick with this heater in a 5 gallon tank. Unless you live in ideal conditions, for 5 gallons I suggest you go for a typical automatic glass heater, instead."
3,Really Quite big,This is a nice idea but the heater itself is to big. It would not fit in the fish bowl I have. it looks small in the picture but it is quite large. I did not send it back because it was not badly priced and I may try and use it in my 5 gallon to keep that water warmer in the winter.
3,Good When It's Not Being Finnicky,"This works just fine to heat one-gallon tanks during cold weather, however a major complaint is that it seems to be extremely sensitive to electrical variation. It does not work if it's plugged into a surge protector or power strip, or if it's plugged into an outlet that has those items plugged in through another socket. It basically only works if you plug it directly into a wall (in other words, directly into the socket that's in the wall, not through a power strip) by itself or with only very few other low-voltage ( <12v ) items plugged in. That makes it really inconvenient to use in my apartment since almost every outlet supports multiple devices, but once you find an outlet it will play nicely with, it works great."
3,"Works, but be very careful","I have used this heater for a 2.5 gallon Betta tank for over a year and it works well if you monitor it. I use it in the water connected to a light timer so that it turns on only at night while the aquarium light is off. This keeps the tank between 75 and 80 degrees. Otherwise, with the room temperature at a constant 66-68 degrees and the aquarium light burning it warms the water too much and will cook my betta. I think all aquarium heaters should have an automatic shut off when the water hits 85 degrees. Be careful with this one, but it will do the job. Don't even think about using this without a thermometer and close monitoring."
5,A must have!!!!,"I would recomend this item. I have my Betta in a 2 gallon tank and this heater is small enough and easy to hide behind a plant. I have had it set up for 2 days now and it has been maintaining 75 degrees. My Betta appears to like it, he spends alot of time hanging out by it warming himself. Try it."
4,one key for multiple lock,Was so very satisfied when I received the 1st one that I ordered another 3 but found that 1 key can open them all. Is this supposed to happen?
3,Not as mirrored as what is pictured,"The visor fits as it should. It doesn't seem to be as mirrored as pictured. The company that it ships from is very fast, but they lack in packaging. If I weren't experienced with delicate items, I would have sliced the visor badly. Be prepared to carry a wipe cloth, this thing shows every finger print."
4,Great Book,Great Book! If you need any type of inspiration this is the book to have. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the DVD got a little boring after a while.
4,More Website Design Eyecandy,"This book is jam packed with website home page eye-candy. Most of the screen shots are of website home pages but there are a few pages that dive a bit deeper into some sites. This book isn't about the inner workings of websites but more like a visual reference book for design layout, color combinations, type treatment and image treatment. All sites in this book have their URL posted with their screen shot so you can dive in deeper if you wish. The bonus DVD contains 6 interviews from 6 different countries each talking about different topics. It is interesting but not terribly exciting.If you are a visual communication designer this book would be an added bonus for your reference shelf."
1,the book is out of date!,completely out of date. lacks the explanations as to why each website was chosen. many of the websites have been already replaced by new ones..the dvd attached makes you watch the whole movie without being able to jump forward/backwards.
4,Full of Wonderful Websites,"Very useful for getting new ideas to create a website, it has a big variety of well designed websites"
2,"hardly consistant in quality, already outdated","Some books aimed at webdesign try to dig deeper than the superficial exterior. Probably because they wish to place a design into the right context, because they understand that a pretty picture doesn't make a good design. One needs to know its goal, target audience and so on to pass judgement on that. Or because they understand the interest of professional designers to exchange ideas, processes and methods. This book (and also for example the below average ""webdesign index series"") simply wants to offer you graphic junkfood. Just screendumps lacking any consistancy in quality and selection, and unfortunately most already outdated. A cynic would call these books an attempt by the publisher to make a quick buck. Publishing other peoples work, they don't get a dime and getting a hefty price paid in return..."
4,Diamond music shines with brilliance,"This cd proves that Karl Jenkins is truly capable of composing memorable and emotional music. Honestly, my favorite piece is the music from the diamond commercial, which is played wonderfully of string instruments. The other songs are also unique and grand, but they lack some of the emotion present in the tune that first appeared on tv in the diamond commerical. Nevertheless, this is a great cd to play at any time of day."
4,"first movement of Palladio is great, rest of CD awful","I LOVE the first movement of Palladio, the music you hear in the TV ads (""Diamond Music""). It's perhaps one of the greatest masterpieces of the twentieth century with a heroic and yet classical thunder reminiscent of Beethoven. The other two movements, in comparison, sound very formulaic and stiff. The Adiemus variations feel dead without the original choral accompaniment, and the string quartet was so boring, I still haven't listened to all of it. So to get to the point, I strongly recommend this CD for the opening of Palladio, it's awesome! But just don't expect much from the rest of the CD. But then again, if you're one of those people who like ""modern"" sounds, then the rest of the CD may appeal to you. If you like classical and romantic classical music, then the first movement of Palladio is the only reason to get this album."
5,My Diamonds,I was happy to find this CD. I had purchased it about 12 years ago and it became damaged. My 6 year old grandson was fascinated by the music and I let him have it. He is now 18 and still enjoys it (along with other music)
3,nice but you only get 1 book and can't choose it,"When I purchsed this item, it showed a picture of 3 books. Also, the product description says ""Rock a bye Baby, I'm a Little Teapot, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"". This makes it sound like you will get all three of these books, but in reality you only get one and you don't get to choose which one that is. I was disappointed that only one randomly selected book was sent when they do not make it clear in the item description that this will be the case. Despite that, it is a nice audio book. We ended up with the ""I'm a Little Teapot"" book. It seems sturdy and my daughter loves it. Just don't buy this item if you're wanting a specific book or if you're expecting to get all 3 of them."
3,Other Books,"Had to read this, while not too bad, I much prefer Blue Fin, or Storm Boy. This is the story of some German immigrants who come to South Australia to make a life for themselves, and the hard work, troubles and rewards that they encounter along the way."
3,fine for an overview of the decade...,"...however, I found this other book ""Fashionable Clothing from the Sears Catalogs: Late 1950s"" to be more helpful as there were more images despite the narrower span of time. Also the images are in color in the book I mentioned."
4,broken zipper,skull candy backpack was great until the zipper on the outside broke then couldnt find anyone willing to repair it
4,"good tape, hard to find","I ordered the 665 and 666 at the same time. The 666 has a split liner which left a visible line down the middle of the tape. Thats probably not a problem for most people.I prefer the 665 because even though it does not have a liner, it also does not have the line down the middle of the tape. Would like to see the tape with a 1-piece liner."
4,Enjoyable...,"This is the first of K. Ranneys ""Highland"" series. The beginning. Even though this story got a bit off track for awhile, it was still told exceptionally well once the Author pulled it back together. I was thoroughly captivated with the dilemma facing the ""couple of interest"". Cute, ""safe"" plot with lots of History thrown in."
2,annoying heroine,The heroine of this book was irritating. The writer tried to make her seem headstrong and strong willed but she was really just rather stupid to provoke men who were much more powerful than she so openly. She was just extremely lucky that the hero was a good guy and stopped her from getting hurt. She tries to defend men who are complete cowards and just cause trouble and let her take the consequences. There was zero chemistry and the you just don't care about the characters.
2,tediumanyone?,"A bit on the overdone-arty-side, as in 'studio-doodle-ing'... Art? Keith Richards usta muse, ""far as I'm concerned, Art is short for Arthur""."
2,No Growth,"I loved Depeche Mode and Adam Wilder but this record is lacking for me. Adam still tries to hold on to the American ghetto culture in a way that does not work like it did on Liquid.The songs are long and often boring without much substance. An Eh?, spin."
5,What a collection!,"Since seeing my first Galaxy Angel episode in 2005, I decided I wanted to collect as many of the episodes as I could. The Galaxy Angel What's Cooking Limited Edition Box is a fine addition to my collection.Granted, the box only contains the first DVD of the show with four episodes, but there is so much more inside! In addition to the DVD, a special booklet with part of the Galaxy Angel managa is enclosed, two pencil boards showing the girls in all the glory and even five figurines of the Angels!Not only that, but the box can be used to hold all 4 DVD's of the series! For any Galaxy Angel fan, this is a good deal and a purchase I do not regret."
4,Good Read,"Midnight Sun is a very good read and I would recommend it to my friends. The only reason I did not give it a five star is because it was short on the edge of the seat thriller, normally Kat Martin provides."
4,Fun,This is a great romance with lots of adventure! I couldn't put it down and thought it was written well. A light fun read.
3,good quick read,"This was not Kat Martin's best book, but it was entertaining. The plot moved quickly, but at times very predictable. Good for a plane ride, or vacation reading. Easy to put down and come back to later. Worth picking up to read."
2,I Didn't Care,"This is the first book I've tried by Kat Martin and may be my last. I purchased it on the basis of the location - the Yukon.I'm sorry to say that I only read half of this book and then gave up due to lack of interest. I had a good book about Vietnam waiting in the wings and just couldn't force myself to finish this dreary tale of the spunky, blonde prospector and the wounded, morose gazillionaire. The suspense plot just interrupted any flow and frankly, I just didn't care. The 2 stars were given on the basis of the love scenes - Ms. Martin does know how to write a hot encounter."
3,Bluetooth Buyers Beware,"After spending sevral hours trying to make this work I decided maybe it was time to visit the company website.After searching through many clicks I found a page that simply says that this item is NOT compatable with ANY PDA loaded with PPC 2003!In fact, if you take the time to research each adapter located here at Amazon, most aren't. I strongly suggest that you check out the COMPANY'S website to make sure the one you select is.I will give this a 3 however since I did get it to sync to my SE T610 phone. The software and instructions are very well done. This also is a good value for the money.Once they get the drivers for PPC 2K3 worked out this would be a stronger recommendation but until then this is the best I can give.I'm stuck paying return postage to Amazon so I hope this helps you so you don't have to."
1,Not the original GameStop charger for sure,This charger looks nothing like the Gamestop charger I remembers (the writings on it was Black and couldn't be see without holding it up to the light; but with this its on a white paper
2,Fell apart!,"We had an extraordinary bad experience with an Oceanic regulator. We had one on our boat for emergencies and pulled it out one day when a line got wrapped around our prop. The regulator as about 3 years old and had never been used. When I pushed on the plastic purge valve, it fell apart into many little pieces. When we called Oceanic, they informed us that this plastic piece is supposed to be changed frequently during the annual inspection. It has a life of between 2 and 6 years. WTFIT! I have been using scuba equipment for more than 30 years and have never heard of anything like that...avoid this product line."
4,"not realy an ""amazing grace""...","Of corse, an amazing voice of Kathleen battle... but for this title, I was expecting ""more grace"", the titles are short and very different, more a ""overview"" low"
5,Incredible voice,"I love this CD. I don't know how many times I've gotten it out from the library. :) It certainly won't be long before I get it for myself. Kathleen Battle's voice is absolutely clear, light, and accurate. Her trills, ahh :)"
5,AMAZING!,"Kathleen's voice is like an angels. A bit thin at times, but other than that beautiful. Get it and treasure it forever."
1,"Found it by a dumpster, should have left it there","If you expect to get insight from this book, you have no business talking to a woman. However, this book is good for a laugh. It goes from slightly misogynistic to raunchy in short order. The author takes himself much too seriously. I'd like to know why he's thanking so many other women in the foreword. Maybe they helped him out with some of the ideas. Great Gag Gift!"
5,Worth the Read!,"Riveting, soulful. Had me turning the pages in anticipation. I have recommended this book to family and friends."
2,Impersonal and unsurprising,"I am not a big Barry Norman fan. Not by a long shot and I'm glad he was sacked by the BBC. This book is just Norman all the way through: cold, objective and clearly someone who doesn't particularly like films very much. With the exception of Gregory's and perhaps Sleeper, all of them are the kind of films that critics love and appear on every critic's top 100 list: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Some Like It Hot, Unforgiven... They're all in there. What's more, Norman barely tells us why the are actually on his list and the entries themselves not insightful at all and just plain dull. Sure, he says ground breaking techniques, superb acting top notch script and genius directors, a film that others have copied since its release, but rarely says anything about their entertainment value or why he personally loves them so much. Worth a glance to big fans fans of cinema and Barry Norman fans (if such things exist), but little else."
4,I agreed with both...,"the positive and negative reviews of this book. The positive reviews correctly pointed out that Hill points out numerous flaws in single-member districting, such as the unrepresentation of demographic and political minorities and the dangers of gerrymandering. But the negative reviews correctly pointed out that the book includes lots of gratuitious conservative-bashing, thus limiting its appeal to anyone to the right of Ralph Nader."
3,Important Topics but Hyper-Repetitive,"I really struggled with this book, but not because of its message. Indeed, the thorough review of the failures of American Winner-Take-All elections is impressive. Phenomena like voter apathy, low turnout, campaign smear tactics and sound-bite politics are all expertly traced back by Hill to the systematic marginalization that is the hallmark of our Winner-Take-All electoral scheme. But this book is infuriatingly redundant. Don't get me wrong -- I love reading; can't get enough. But this book is so repetitive as to try any book lover's patience. A more discerning editor could have trimmed this book down to half its size. So I would defintely recommend buying this book -- but be prepared for a long, meandering journey."
2,"good nugget of information, but too short","When I read the title of the piece, I thought it might be helpful. Upon further reading, I was lead to believe that it would be six pages. After spending six bucks on it, I found that it was barely three. The first to pages were simply the Harvard Review title, and the rest were half covered with pictures of Parcells. Everything Parcells says is true and informative, but it's so short of an article that I feel a little ripped off. Players and employees appreciate honesty, I've played on crappy teams and a good one, and the coaches on the good one weren't afraid to tell me if I sucked. Likewise, I've had the chance to work for a myth by modern standards, a highly sucessful small business. The owner of that taught me a valuiable lesson, better to be upfront and honest than to meddle in deception. This is a good article, but I have a sick feeling that if I just googled around, I could of found it for free."
3,"good a-side, nice remix","this is an ok blur single. the a-side is one of those nice sad songs that are a good listen. it's damon singing in the first person which isn't common. the cornelius remix of tender is excellent. it takes a folky song and makes it faster and a bit kitsch. definately some good work there on his part. 'so you' sounds like a demo. it's pretty unpolished, but still, isn't really awful. i would only recommend this to blur fans or anyone who liked their single 'tender', because the remix is really the stongest work on this record."
4,And I found that I was indeed searching,"This really was a good book. And don't be discouraged by the fact that it says it's for ages 9-12. I'm 15 and enjoyed it thoroughly. For most of the book, the main character, Emmaline is about 16, so it's ok.It is fairly depressing but uplifting as well! It tells the story of Emmaline, in England, as she battles to survive and take care of her deaf younger brother as her mother becomes addicted to laundanum and pawns everything they own to get money for it.I won't give it all away, but that's the gist of it. when her mother sells little deaf Tommy to a chimney sweep for 5 years of service, Emmaline goes to London to get him back."
3,Not really for Fortune Tellers but Okay as a Translation.,"There are various forms of ""fortune telling"" divination that are routinely used by the Chinese for prognostication. And after using these forms ""plum blossom divination, etc."" the I Ching is then interpreted accordingly. When used in the usual fashion by way of coins or yarrow stalks, the I Ching does not fortell the future so much as it offers guidance on personal conduct. That being said, this book is a fair modern translation of the original Zhouyi or Book of Changes."
2,Torn packaging,The product I ordered was fine except the packages were both sliced open. They were shipped in a plastic package that was completely ripped open. I ordered two of these for my grandsons and had to go out and buy a sports bag to put them in because they were a gift and I couldn't give them to them the way they were delivered. I ordered these in good faith and they weren't a bargain they were supposed to be new and I was very disappointed.
3,Nice product terrible packaging,Shipment arrived promptly. Items (I purchased 2) were in the original packaging which was torn and filthy. There was even a third glove in one of the sets?! Other than having to clean and dust my purchases they seem to be as described.
1,Unreadable...,"I have to give this one star based on the fact that it was almost unreadable.The font type used for this printing is terrible and not easy to read. Also, the font appeared to be bold throughout the entire book, making it hard on the eyes. Maybe too much ink was used for my printing because the font also appeared too dark and blurry in many pages."
3,the picture doesnt match,"I needed this book for a literature class, and when I received it the product was an older edition than that pictured here. Wasn't a problem for me, but just make sure."
2,Plays like a broken record......,It's interesting for five minutes...and that's when you are flipping through the pages.He is always coming back to the same points.This should have been a summarized and compressed phamplet.
3,"Interesting, yet hypocritial","Well, he even talks Amazon.com as a cathedral of consumption, and brings up such facts as doing what I am doing, reviewing books on amazon.com. I found it to be hypocritical for him to badmouth consumption so much, yet he profits from the things he badmouths, such as my purchase of his book at amazon.com He claims most are subject to consumption. Well, unless you go around naked, live in a cafe and eat sticks, everyone is. This book serves as a valuable tool to look into the methods of consumption that rule our daily lives, but don't get too caught up it how bad it is, consumption feeds the author and his family also."
3,A little on the quiet side.,"I replaced the burnt out flasher with a tridon 552, which turned out to be the same part number as the old one. Works for the most part but I will say the new relay is considerably quieter then its predicessor."
5,Didnt last too long but worked!,Didn't last forever like it states on the box but it lasted long enough to give power to the set of LED turn signals on my Kawasaki Ninja.
4,"""It's crime fightin' time...again.""","I was so excited when I finally heard the last of the episodes of C.O.P.S. was finally going to be on DVD. This show really takes me back. I find it ironic that while they limited the violence such as punches, kicks and anything traumatic to the series, they never showed any reluctance by putting out a toy line that let kids use potentially dangerous, smelly firing caps, that if you're not careful you could catch your hand or finger, and of course that little homage to A CHRISTMAS STORY, you know the one. ""You'll shoot your eye out."""
4,Wish they had the PSA at the end,I loved this show as a kid and am happy to have it at home again. I just wish the show came with the PSAs at the end of the episodes.
4,Fun cartoon,"I was about 17 when C.O.P.S. came out, and it holds up pretty well over time.When the most interesting parts to me is the Nightshade/Mace romance. There are two episodes that deal primarily with it, and it is also an important subplot of the Miss World competition, in which Mace is proved right that Nightshade was pretty and talented enough to win honestly. The romance is interesting as most US animation wouldn't attempt a relationship between a villain and a hero, and the character growth that results for Nightshade.Lots of good episodes at a cheap price to complete the C.O.P.S. collection."
4,Great Kids Book,I am not sure of the IQ accuracy but it is a great puzzle and educational question book. my daughter enjoy doing the questions like a puzzle book. The only negative is their is just two tests in the book. I wish their were more test or this was part of series.
4,Great book!,This is one of my daughter's favorite books that she has for her LeapPad system. It was a gift from her aunt who is an elementary school teacher. It's one that she goes back to time after time and will sit with for long periods of time.
4,Cute and educational,"I bought this book for my 3 year old's leap pad, with the idea that he would do an activity on his own that wouldn't entail watching TV.This particular book keeps him busy for a good 20 minutes, sometimes more, which is great for that age. I gave it four stars as I don't know how long he'll be interested, and it's probably a bit advanced for his age, so far I'm very happy with how the book keeps him entertained and learning at the same time."
4,Solid,"Book can be sectioned pretty well. MacLean is brilliant in painting a portrait of the type of tough, intelligent men who are the smokejumpers. His telling of the tale of the disaster is gripping and detailed just right. By not being maudlin about the young men's deaths, a more dignified grief is achieved. The manly, uncomplaining lingering deaths of Sylvia and Hellman will bring tears to the meanest of men. MacLean is brilliant in piecing together why these men met their disasterous fate and why three of them were to survive. MacLean gets a little plodding at book's end when he tries to explain fire science-important work, to be sure, but dull to the layman."
2,Rambles,"I haven't read a river runs through it but I enjoyed the movie and since I would like to become a smokejumper I figured this would be a perfect fit. Unfortunately this books rambles on with insight and info interspersed between paragraphs of dribble. Very literary and refined dribble to be sure. If you want info and facts stick with wiki, if you like pointless lit..."
5,great tribute,"as a firefighter, I was very interested in this case. The author did a great job of describing the events of this tragedy."
1,"A terrible, poorly written account of a magnificent disaster",It is always a bad precident to sit down to read a book that the author never finished. In this case it is fair to say that he never began. This book is a loose collection of notes and incoherant narratives which McLean intended to use to make a book. It was then complied and allowed to stand on its own merits as an unedited first draft. Don't waste your time since neither the author nor his publisher expected anything more from themselves.
1,My Book Club Hated It,"Only 1 out of 9 of us bothered to finish reading this book. The author rambles, gave too much details. I don't think he ever intended to publish this book. The entire book seems to be just notes on the Fire. The book ends with a parallel to the death of the author's wife from cancer to dying in a fire. It appears to be an aimless rambling, just like the rest of the book. Skip this book!"
4,an unfinished masterpiece,"Norman Maclean, a professor of English at the University of Chicago, was obsessed with two events: one was Custer's Last Stand, and the other was the Mann Gulch fire, the subject of this haunting book published posthumously.You can tell that Maclean hadn't finished writing--sections are repeated now and then, and as a whole the work is formless. Nevertheless, what you'll find between the covers of this volume will haunt you: it is about hubris, fate, death and tragedy. Maclean seems to feel so acutely the fear in the men's eyes as they burned to death. Making sense of this tragedy becomes a miniature study of the meaning of life and the meaning of death. The project must have been especially poignant given Maclean's own failing health as he tried to finish this work. Even in its rough form, this book is a masterpiece."
5,A great story,"I loved this book. The detail and analysis resulted from decades of research and Maclean is a terrific writer. I love the piece-by-piece, methodical dissection of the story. I find this method of story telling and anaylsis similar to John Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"". I would like to see more maps and photos, but those that are included in the book are sufficient by most measures."
3,"Lackluster, but interesting nonetheless.","Readers and fans of A River Runs Through It will be disappointed if they're looking for the same meditative, lyric narrative on fire that they found on water. This is not literature, as other reviews have stated. But as a study of a disaster and the series of errors that led to it, with some approachable fire-science thrown in, the book is worth a read. Especially since the same mistakes keep getting made, and fire gets no less dangerous. Skip through the parts where you get bored and you'll enjoy it more."
3,Young Men and Fire(reviewed by M. Wolf,"Young Men and Fire is a book about smokejumpers. It is set in Montana, in 1949. At this time, smokejumpers were a new thing to the forest service, and most of these guys didn't have much training or any experience. In the book, fifteen smokejumpers are sent in to the Mann Gulch fire, to assist a ground crew. When they got there they had no maps or anything to guide them because they thought the ground crew would have them, but they never found the ground crew. Then the winds picked up and the fire chased the men away from it. It was moving so fast that only three of the men survived the run, and one died the next day from the burns.I think that this is a good book and probably would recommend it. It does have a weakness in its description, which is probably because the author was not there to experience the event. I think people from Montana would like this book, but people who come from places with no rugged mountain areas would not understand it like we do."
5,A fitting tribute,"Norman Maclean was born to write this book. As an outdoorsman, a wildland firefighter of the same generation as the books subjects and one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, Norman Maclean's voice becomes the ideal homage to the hero's of Mann Gulch. While fans of Maclean's fiction might miss some of the poetry of his previous works, they will visit a new side of the author in this work as he pieces together the puzzle of Mann Gulch and makes peace with his own personal ghosts. Here the author, in his words, seeks to let the ""tragedy become a story"". The tragedy is told in detail, both honestly and reverently. Maclean labors to remain dispassionate and honest, to, ""not become to sentimental"". The tragedy he relates is horrible, the story of the tragedy is beautiful. It is a fitting tribute to the crosses of Mann Gulch and the memories of those who died there."
4,Solid effort,"You can tell Young Noble takes his craft seriously from listening to this CD. He touches on topics such as family, integrity, pain, death, and joy. The solo as well as the possee cuts are high energy and give you your moneys worth. I would definitely recommend this album to other hip hop fans."
5,Respect Ourz,"I bought this album from Yoyomusik(one of the sellers) and wow the CD is great, Tracks I like:Respect Ourz, it is a very dark and aggressive track.Another good one is the slow Godz Handz,the loud and that's how its going to be track Hate me or love me,The true Baby Mama which suggests respect to women,Get Bac- Young Nobles declaration to the rap game,Timez up(great beat) and it has the game but he sounds like Dr Dre in a way(good rap but he is way better now).Gatz up, I like this track except E.D.I kind of sucks.I like Baby Girl on Your World, she's a great rapper for 10? years old. And the rest are okay."
3,"Not the worst text book, but I've read better","Let me start by saying what I find is the biggest stand out in this book. There is no glossary. To my way of thinking that is a bad thing for a textbook, and in this case it is a textbook with a lot of specific terminology so a glossary is really necessary.On the plus side there is a reference page at the end of each chapter instead of at the end of the book. Further it is a fairly quick read, although the chapters are entirely too long. Overall if I were an instructor I would look for a more ""learner friendly"" book first, but if there was nothing else this would do. If you are not compelled to buy this because it is required for a class I would not bother."
2,Less Than Impressed,"I had one of the authors as a professor for my speech development class, and this was the assigned book.Although the authors are clearly knowledgeable, the text fails as both a learning tool and a reference book. If you actually read the book through, the writing is awkwardly casual and filled with less than helpful examples. The chapters titles and heading make finding specific information difficult, and the index is not user-friendly. There are also several times where statistics provided seem contradictory.Although this edition contains several valuable additions, overall the previous editions are better resources."
4,Entertaining.,"If you've watched many of these sports documentaries (e.g. Running on the Sun, A Race For the Soul, 140.6, The Runner, even Trek, and others), they tend to all be very similar in story...overcoming odds to accomplish some physically daunting, albeit seemingly ""impossible"" task. There's the usual physical and emotional struggles, some things predictable, some not. Still, this one is on par with most of the others. Entertaining and worth watching."
4,A great value for the money,"This is a great book to use to learn Kabuli Dari (the version of Persian spoken in Kabul). I have not been able to find a better book in English for learning Dari. Most of the books available are for learning Farsi (the version of Persian spoken in Iran).I feel that some of the other reviewers have unfairly harsh in their reviews. This is a relatively inexpensive book (currently $12). It does not come with an audio CD. I don't think anyone should expect to be able to learn a language from a book and have perfect pronunciation. If you want to learn the language properly you will need an audio companion for this book or ideally a tutor. The book that the other reviewers offer as a better alternative (Thackston's Introduction to Persian) is for learning Farsi, not Dari.This book is a great way to try out learning Dari with minimal financial investment."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I agree with the first two reviews that were written concerning this book. I've been going back and forth to Afghanistan for almost 4 years now and purchased this book because I misplaced a different one I normally use. I had my interpreters look through this book and they all agreed that it is not a proper book to use for beginner's because it is very confusing. Why would you learn to write a foreign language before you learn to speak or pronounce the alphabet or words? There is no need to go on about this, I'm not an author and do not have the skills to write a book on this topic and should just say...this is not the book for beginners."
2,Characters lacked viewer sympathy.,"I was interested in viewing the movie because of a newspaper review. I could not find a place to rent the movie in my area ofWhittier, California so I finally decided to buy the DVD.For the price I paid I was disappointed with the movie. I was hoping for more depth in the development of the characters and their relationship in the time prior to the baby kidnapping.I may need a second viewing to fully appreciate the story line and some empathy for the characters. Sometimes seeing a movie more than once creates a better appreciation of it.The good news is after several months of trying to find the movie to rent my quest is no over."
2,QUE ES?,"This is one of those movies that tries too hard to be artsy and substitues content, with close ups of the lead actors face. I was bored to tears in about five minutes. Plus it didnt help that the movie was in spanish without subtitles. I speak enough spanish to find the nearest bathroom in tiajuana but beyond that it's not easy to follow a plot."
3,about this title of DVDfilm/movie 'battle in heaven',"This film is all about Ana (general's daughter) whose chauffer could not resist to sexual urge end up having sex with Ana which she later also slept with her boyfriend. ( a lot of other portion of the story in front) and end up Ana been stabbed to die by the chaeuffer due to his problematic personality which end up.....(very interesting, up to all to find out). Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVDfilm/movie.Battle In HeavenWritten by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahMR Franc MBBS for Avoxin, True Vecomycin etc and medical findingGPS for professional photographing from RPS for scenery.Director David Yates for Hary Potter, Order of the Phoenix.Director Paul Greengrass for Bourne Ultimatum.Director Bill Nichie for Notes on the Scandal.Director Ron Howard for Da Vinci Code.Thank you and have a nice day watching my films."
1,Really Really Bad,This film had no idea what it wanted to be. It is disjointed and utterly awful. Even the sex scenes were awful. I bought it and simply tossed into the trash after one viewing.
4,Great book. Track of the wolf has the book for $25,It's a good book and a great help understanding Hawken design.Track of the wolf sells new copies for $25Asking over $500 for a used copy is nuts.
2,Just not to par.,"As other reviewers note... this one just doesn't meet the standards of the two previous DVDs in the series. I'm not at all bothered, and neither is my child, by Elmo's Dad shaving off his mustache OR Prairie Dawn's Mom getting a more contemporary hairstyle... their voices and mannerisms are the same. It's just like in the real world... peoples looks vary over time. But, I was bothered by the poor sound quality of the ""live"" recordings between Matt and Romy. Also, their interaction wasn't as cheerful as prior parent/child segments. Matt really seems to be quizzing Romy the whole time. Not too much fun to watch. And, the songs are not as ""catchy"". Overall, disappointing."
1,K.N.,"Our 13 month old daughter is a sesame street fanatic since she was 9 months old! We owned the first two ""sesame beginnings"" DVDS and she just loves them both. She dances and claps her hands to the music, and her smile just lites up the room. I was so excited when I had seen the new Sesame Beginning DVD, ""Exploring Together"", so, naturally I ordered it. VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTING!!! The music was disappointing and boring. My daughter's attention span was limited for this particular video. I hope the next video will be better!"
2,Sound Quality Poor,I agree with the previous reviewer. The sound quality is different. My 14 month old son loves the first two of this series. I wouldn't bother buying this one. He loses interest after 5 minutes too. The songs aren't that exciting and start to sound simliar after awhile. Maybe this one would be better for kids over 2.
3,A bit of a disappointment,"My 14-month-old son and my 2-year-old niece enjoyed watching the first two (Beginning Together and Make Music Together), so I thought that purchasing the third one would be a good investment. This third one seems to be filmed differently (I can hear lots of background noise when the parents and Matt/Romy are being taped) and Prairie Dawn's mom and Elmo's dad are different. My niece was confused and didn't know who those two characters were. Her comment was, ""That doesn't look like Prairie Dawn's mom!"" I think that the Muppet interaction and the music are great, but my niece and son have attempted to watch this video at least 6 times, and every time, they loose interest about 5 minutes into it. I really wish that Sesame Street would have kept the third movie the same as the first two!"
1,Not great,"We watched this twice before I gave it to my cousin for her baby.It was totally annoying. All the segments of the real parents and kids interacting were totally boring and irritating to both me and my children.The songs were all repetitive and bland.Matt Laurer and his daughter's interaction seemed forced and rehearsed.There wasn't enough actual acting by the muppets and I was really turned off by most of this DVD with the real people.The concept was good, but it totally could have been better."
4,Just okay!,This one doesn't seem to catch my daughter's attention. There's only one that does (Sesame Beginnings: Make Music Together).
2,AFAICT this is a gullible rip off,"Look - all I can tell you is this stuff looks and acts identical to premium packaging tape. Why am I paying $13 for 15 yards of packaging tape to stick on my book cover, (worth $.30, roughly)? I bought a full roll (300' / 100 yds) of 4"" tape with a 4"" permanent dispenser for $8 from Staples. Another brand. Can't tell the difference. Maybe the adhesive is better - that's possible and I don't know cause I returned this roll (thanks Amazon.) Years ago I bought some binding materials including a roll of clear tape that was 3 or 4 times thicker - that's what I thought I was buying again. Just FYI."
2,Packaging tape does same job for less,"While this tape is a tiny bit thicker than the standard Scotch packaging tape, I can't see that it is really worth the higher price. As with all new products, I like to try them out exactly how the directions say before doing things my way, and the directions for repairing a paperback book are pretty much useless. The tape rips easily, so trying to make precision cuts with a normal pair of scissors was basically impossible for me to do without the tape simply ripping the whole way across. What ""tabs"" did manage to not tear off were of no use repairing the book in question, so I quickly abandoned the suggested way and did my own thing. I am thoroughly not impressed with the product and am very disappointed in its quality, especially considering the price."
1,really?,"really,all this is is packing tape that I could have gotten at walmart or anywhere for alot cjeaper price!! not a good purchase!"
4,Does the job,"I have a roll of this tape, and another roll of Scotch Shipping Packaging Tape. The latter is widely available at drug stores, food center, and so forth. The width of the two rolls is the same: two inches. The adhesive feels the same to me. Why bother to go looking for this ""book tape?"" Maybe the book tape is a bit more transparent. I don't think it is quite as strong as the ordinary tape.It is a fine product, like everything else that Scotch makes. I would not go out of my way to find it, because their ordinary tape is similar."
4,Time will tell,"It is a bit hard to tell this tape from regular packaging tape. Scotch is claiming that the big difference between this tape and regular packing tape is that this tape will not yellow over time. Hopefully, that's true, though it's impossible to say right now. One thing I did like was that there were instructions on the box to show the best way to use the product on both paperback and hardcover books. That was helpful. It did seem that once I cut the tape as instructed for my paperback, (in a ""T"" shape along the spine), it seemed to rip too easily when I tried to fit it onto the book as instructed. But overall a useful product."
5,"Made to LAST--here's why, I'm told....","I used to work in a library and I know this product well. It is designed to last for years on books, magazines, and whatever else you might think of.The reason it lasts, I was told by a 3M person, is that the plastic tape itself is thick, which prevents the adhesive from drying out. Have you noticed how paper masking tape lasts only a short time? That's because the adhesive is not protected by the porous paper, dries up, and falls off. Cellophane ""Scotch"" tapes are better, but still are a bit porous. Thick tapes like this book tape almost totally prevent drying out of the adhesive and thus last a long time. Of course, the adhesive itself is super strong, which helps.At the library we used adhesive labels for videocassettes that had a thin but impermeable layer of foil between the adhesive and the paper, which completely prevented dryout. Those labels stayed on forever (and are still in place), while all the paper labels eventually fell off."
5,Fast Fix,"We needed to repair books with a 2"" spine; the 4"" width works the best. Unfortunately it isn't carried in the local stores so I was delighted to find it on Amazon. The product is very sticky, and yet easy to use for those who have done little or no book repair. Excellent product."
1,don't waste your money,"Based on the reviews, I thought it was some special tape. I got it to repair pages that my daughter ripped. It works just like any other clear packaging tapes, except more expensive. Don't waste your money. I was disappointed. I was looking for something that's more gentle to the pages and matte finish instead of glossy."
5,Great tape,"I send tons of books out every year. This tape is WONDERFUL because it is thick, easy to cut and stays stuck. I also used this on paperback spines to keep the cover secure. Wish it was a little less expensive but other than that this is great."
3,The cost is a bit much,"Sure, this tape will do everything the small illustrations on the package show (which are apparently for people who never figured out how to use tape...). However, this tape is not any different from the same tape you can get for less in a generic form anywhere. It does not seem appreciably stronger or thicker (which would be detrimental to strengthening edges of books in any case) than the cheap packing tape available at any department, discount or hardware store. I love this kind of tape for repairing or preventing damage to larger format paperbacks (like my Rise and Fall of the Third Reich), but the price on this roll of simple clear tape is just too high. Get some of the cheap stuff for $1-2 and get the same results."
3,Not exactly what I expected... but it worked.,"I recently got around to using this product... I was a little surprised. I've worked in shipping and receiving on and off for years. The product didn't appear to be any more then a standard roll of 2"" heavy duty clear packing tape. I was expecting something a little different being as this is for book repair... maybe something acid free.I used it, it works for the purposes required, we'll see for how long, but I could have just used packing tape I already have since there didn't appear to be any real difference."
4,Much better then regular tape,"The tape fulfills a real need. It permits book repairs which are effective and simple to implement. The tape is thicker and wider than the usual office cellophane tape. It solves the problem where the binding has split in the middle, and opaque tape would conceal text if it were used. It is flexible enough so that the repaired binding still handles the way a book should."
3,Clear packing tape works just as well,"I didn't find anything special about this product. It's a clear tape that is similar (if not the same) width as clear packing tape and it also seems to be equally as thick. In light of the fact that you should have a dispenser to use this tape, I simply didn't find it practical to use (I didn't have the dispenser). I think I may have been more impressed with this product if the box somehow could have been fashioned to be the tape dispenser for ease of use.I used this product on a damaged hardcover book and a school folder that was falling to pieces. It does provide adequate coverage however again; I didn't see how this product was any different from clear packing tape. It's wide, shiny clear tape - that's it.Unless this product was priced significantly less than regular packing tape, I'd probably pass on this."
4,Pleased and I liked that it was clear,"I was very pleased with this product. It basically looks like clear packing tape, however I was pleasantly surprised with how heavy it was. I also liked that it was clear. Generally when I think of book tape, I think of the thick, colored stuff that librarians use. This was heavy, not with that type of texture, but was clear so it allowed you to see the book. I liked that."
4,Works well.,"We've been using this in our household to repair our many beat up copies of role-playing game books, and it's been a lifesaver. It works better, and looks better, than the packing tape that we usually use for this purpose. I'll admit that I was initially skeptical -- tape is tape, right? -- but this tape really does get the job done."
4,"Works good as tape, but I don't see why it is called "" BOOK TAPE.""",I use this tape just like I use regular Scotch tape to mail packages. It doesn't seem any thicker or harder to cut or tear than regular tape. I just personally did not see the difference between this tape and regular Scotch mailing tape.
4,For Those who don't want to get rid of old paperbacks &LPs,"Some of us have products that we've had for years, whether it be a book or album, that we either can't or would prefer not to update to a newer format. For me, I have a few old paperbacks that are no longer in print and several vinyl albums. After a number of years, some of these things can start to come apart. This Scotch book tape addresses that need. I think this is a very good idea for those with large book or record collections and allows preserving the old favorites."
4,Thick & Rich,"Thicker than plain mailing tape. Will make any needed repairs to your ole books & magazines look like your butler did it. Professional hard-wearing results.Would definitely call this a speciality item. Not sure if I have ever seen in a ""normal"" store?"
5,A little bit of magic in this tape!,"For years I've been repairing book covers and pages with regular Scotch tape, which as many know has a tendency to discolor, curl and lose its ""stickiness"" over time. But that was all that was available as far as I knew.As a book lover I'm delighted to have this tape made especially for books. The width is great and covers a multitude of tears (especially some jagged ones on favorite children's books.) Also like the transparency - recently repaired a dark green book jacket and the tape all but disappeared.What I don't have is a proper dispenser for this tape so I lose a little by folding over so it won't stick to itself. As far as I'm concerned that's a small price to pay for the tape my books have been waiting all their lives for."
3,Looks nice,I got it in a short time...however the watch itself is not quite satisfaying for me....although it looks nice...but that part should be around the wrest is not well combined..so it's easy to fall.
3,Not please with quality on this...,"This was obviously a previously opened and returned watch. The packaging had been cracked and the instructions/guarantee were gone and the plastic backing was off the back and then re-added making the back all sticky. There was no plastic covering the face to keep it from scratching and that's not normal either. Very unhappy with this purchase. Would have liked the watch itself, perhaps, had it arrive in better condition."
2,Doesn't work,"The base idea for this book is to look for a ""Core Night"" which is the first time your baby sleeps for longer than usual. Once he does that the author says you can expect him to do it all the time by not going to him during those Core Night hours. She says the Core Night is the Secret Weapon and happens usually in the first 4 weeks. But what if you miss is? What if your baby is older than 4 weeks? And what if he cries very hard during those Core Night hours? There are a few ideas throughout the book, but I found a better one that had a more specific plan called The No Cry Sleep Solution which is for babies of all ages."
5,Excellent,"After reading many books to help me get through the first few months of parenthood, I was given this book . I wish I'd read it while still pregnant, this book is excellent, a great resource, very practical and gives you good suggestions on how to extend your baby's night sleep. I borrowed it from a friend whose baby was sleeping 10 hours a night at 6 weeks old, if it worked for her I thought it was worth a shot and i really think its helping. i highly recommend it."
5,Great product,This product was a steal of a deal and a great product! I would not look at any other brand for the value you get here!
2,Theremostat broke?,"I got this product used, but I tested and it does heat. Problem is, it doesn't stop heating. I have a 72 gallon tank, and I set it to 80. THe tank stayed steady at 85 or 86!!!I lowered thermostat to 75, now 72. Still at 86 and about 87 at the peak of the day!!! Not sure if it was used and abused, but damn, thats too hot. Will not get same brand."
1,useless,I had the heater set at 87 degrees my tank remained at 78 no higher for the last two days.... Useless!!!!!!!
5,"Raw, but fun","I had never heard of Kevin Fowler before seeing him at the Cabaret in Bandera. He has a great sound and puts on a great show. This CD is worth buying if you are a fan of Texana music (or progressive Austin country music as some people unfortunately like to phrase it). Beer, Bait and Ammo is a great song. There are four or five others that are quite good. He brings the typical sense of humor associate with this great musical genre and reminds me of a raw Robert Earl Keen, but closer to Charlie Robison. If you buy this disc, you won't be disappointed."
5,Great Texas Country,"I think it's funny this has no reviews. I don't even really like country but this cd is the exception. I guess this isn't mainstream Country but this is by far the best country cd I have ever heard. Bear, Bait, and Ammo says it all. Just listen to it."
3,Something most people don't know,"I just recently got to see Kevin in concert here in San Antonio. I am not a country fan, matter of fact can't stand country. But I like Kevin. He has is own sound and doesn't follow the trends of media manipulated pre manufactured trendy country music that I always here on the radio. I also got to met him and he is a real cool guy to talk to. If your a country fan this is a must have. He reminded me of Phil Anselmo of the heavy metal band Pantera in his on stage antics. Also somthing most of you don't know, Kevin Fowler used to be part of an 80's metal band called ""Dangerous Toys""."
2,Kevin Fowler is number one,"Kevin Fowler is the best Austin musician around. He puts on an awesome live show. The whole band works so well together and are super to hang out with and make every gig feel like the best. I AM Kevin's biggest fan and anyone wanting to have a great time should go and see him live. For a great CD, buy Beer Bait Ammo, it will surely become one of your favorites. It is genuine and 100% Texas country."
1,PASS ON THIS ONE,"This guy is almost good. This recording has a fake country sound to it. However if you like Reba McIntyre, Kevin Fowler is the male equivalent."
3,Small Ceramic Heater,"I like the product it's just that it doesn't seem to make any difference what you set the dial on, it's all the same.I use it in a small bathroom in the early morning when it's cold. It works fine for me just don't except it to heat a large area."
4,Great tent heater,This is the second one I bought. One for myself and one for my son to use for camping. Keeps the tent warm and is safe to operate. Love it.
1,Diasappointed,when this Pelonis is on it produces odd smell. My previous Pelonis was OK. I am not able to return this purchase.
3,Good but Noisy,"Bought 2 of these and they heat up a room fairly well only thing is that the noise is somewhat irritating especially when trying to watch TV.I gave it 3 stars because of the heat it produces in a short amount of time plus the automatic cut off in case the unit is tipped over by someone or a pet.Very small in size but it does the job,good unit if you dont mind the noise.Would I buy these again?No, not with the noise problem(the wife doesnt care for the units)"
1,Bad motor after 4 days of use!,"I turned this unit on last night after only 3 days of light use. It made a horribly loud sound and then put out a strong electric burning smell! I now know why they say never to leave one of these units unattended! My husband things it turned a bearing in the motor. I will be contacting Amazon about returning and getting a refund. I actually purchased two of these, one as a Christmas gift! I am thinking of returning that one as well!"
4,Mighty Mite,"but it is noisy for such a little fella. It will heat an average size bathroom in a few minutes, the four is for the noise it generates. I was surprised by its small size, it will fit most anywhere. Overall, I'd recommend it."
5,A treasure,"These guys perform with their hearts on fire, and their minds on ice. Their skill is astonishing, their passion evident, and their selection of music superb. Without a doubt, these are two of the greatest musicians alive today."
4,Amazing stuff,"This is a wonderful CD, & the bonus video is also fun. The music is truly amazing, although it is not the type of disc I will keep in frequent rotation. I'm certainly glad I own it, and I play it on my iTunes lists."
1,You gotta be kidding!,"Bela Fleck and Edgar Meyer are both truly adept at their respective instruments. But a whole bunch of classical pieces performed by Banjo and Double Bass??? Yawn! What's next, Kazoo and Bells. Thank god I listened to this CD before I dropped my cash. Some may enjoy and god bless as far as I am concerned; let me at my stack!"
5,"Fun, and well done","Lets see, 2 virtuosos, tackling music genres deemed off limits by the musically uptight, having fun. I say, this is great stuff. There are a few pieces which lets face it, fall out of time but its a gasser to see a banjo and double bass go to their limits and gasp, JAM."
4,Broad Spectrum Virtuosity,"This album runs the gamut of styles and genre. It is hard to get bored when a musical turn is but a few notes away. The two musicians integrate their instruments with incredible skill. I hate to give it a four star rating. The music is worth the 5. The loooooong, live applause tracks detract from the album. The asides by the musicians are sometimes hard to hear. Minor aggravations aside,this album plays frequently, very frequently, in our home,car, iPods, etc."
2,Extremely loud,And not by baby standards. I'm a rock musician and these are some of the loudest shakers on the market. Maybe not the best for baby's ears.
5,My favorite book on the civil rights movement!,"Although it is certainly not as well known or acclaimed as Taylor Branch's Parting the Waters, Egerton's Speak Now Against the Day, is perhaps my favorite book on the civil rights movement. Stories of origins are always interesting and this tale of the activists in the generation prior to the modern movement is riveting, especially in its telling of the story of many who have been forgotten, some of whom were never well known. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about this period, about the enormous courage, strengths, and blind spots of those who led the way - the John the Baptists if you will. Many were white southern liberals, some were moderate segregationists, others were radicals. They tried to convince their brethren of the necessity of change. Their failure set the stage for the titanic clashes of the '50s and '60's and as well as the counter-reaction which followed."
1,Dull and Boring,"For those of us who are familiar with Civil Rights, Egerton's book (along with his pathetic, overblown prose) is a letdown and a bore."
5,Great!,Required reading for doctoral program in Strategic Foresight. Text is engaging and worth the cost.I would highly recommend it for anyone desiring to developing an understanding of Scenario Planning.
5,Works great for me,"I have a 8g nano reef and it works great for me, and ive had it for half a year now. If you have a nano reef that needs some flow this is a great buy."
1,Gears wear-out by 3rd month,"bought two of these deflectors and setup on two different powerheads. worked great for 2months but the continous water pressure pushing on the interal plastic gears wore-out the gears by month #3 ... tried cleaning the gears with a toothbrush but the gears had loosened up so much that the thing quit spinning and became USELESS. you could sit there and hear the gears ""chattering"" and the thing not spinning. a total waste of $15."
4,Interesting mixes to good songs,"Very interesting mixes of some very good songs. The great majority are sung by different people, including Baby Spice. Here's where the story ends, has shown up on a few other cd's and is a great song. They remix old songs with new artists singing them. It makes for a very interesting way to listen to an old song. Very much worth the money if you like European styled music. Unfortunately they are not very well known yet it the United States."
4,Great storage,This tape storage is compact with the ability to add units as the collection grows and looks great in my den.
2,Flimsy & overpriced,"This stand is adequate for the Westcott 5X6 collapsible background (the fabric is lighter in weight), but too flimsy for the 6X7 collapsible and totally useless for the backgrounds with train (e.g. Lastolite). Two of these stands may be able to support a 6X7 without train, but you better check before purchasing."
2,Beautiful...BUT,"Rizzoli, and the Vatican, have produced a beautiful volume; the colour reproduction, binding, and printing are first rate BUT it seems that no-one bothered to read the text before the book was printed. In a not very careful reading of the text I found a number of glaring errors that cast very serious doubt on the reliability of any information contained in this book. Thus, I cannot give this book more than 2 stars.I have been in contact with Rizzoli about this matter and they have provided me with some corrected information that I will share on request."
4,An important corrective,"This important book serves as a useful corrective to typical liberal-Christian theologies of religious pluralism, as well as the indifferentism that plagues a great deal of secular comment on religion. Dinoia takes the claims of the religions seriously--if a Theravada Buddhist, for example, seeks the cessation of the cycle of craving and suffering through pursuit of the blissful extinction of the ego that he calls nirvana, one does him no justice by claiming that he is really pursuing the Christian ideal of eternal life in the Beatific Vision of the Trinity. Dinoia argues that the diversity of religions is real (e.g., they're not all ""basically the same""), and he makes the case that this diversity is providential in a Christian theological sense."
4,It works...,Mine was pink...oh well. I have used it some and it works well. I can feel the muscles really working between my thighs and it works great for toning my triceps as well! Definately will keep using it.
2,Does the job for now,"This thigh toner does not seem that sturdy. It look like it might not last that long, but for now it does the job. I perfer the orignal thigh master I had in the past. This is cheaper in price and quality."
4,Surprised,"I must say that I was surprised when I received the product. Truth be told, I was expecting a piece of junk that I'd probably end up throwing out. However, I was surprised that for the price it's not bad. I keep it in my office and use it throughout the work day. There isn't much resistance, but enough that if you do 15 to 20 reps for multiple reps throughout the work day, you feel it. I'm at my desk for many hours during the day, so this helps (anything helps). So, for the price, its not a bad buy."
1,Not Good Quality,"I owned the original ThighMaster several years ago and decided to purchase one again. I decided to try the Everlast for Her Thigh Toner instead. Big mistake! This thing is not sturdy at all and doesn't work even half as well as the ThighMaster. It's wobbly between your legs--not at all sturdy--so it's difficult to keep in place. There is very little padding, so it hurts your legs after just a short while. The minute you pick it up, you can tell it's not high quality whatsoever. Also, the one I received was pink--not white as it is in the picture."
2,keep away from this piece of junk!,"it hurts to put it between the thighs as the foam is much to thin. One may be tempted to buy it thinking it's convenient, but it's not b/c you will only use it once!"
3,It's not bad,I don't use it as much as i thought. The plastic in the middle comes loose but it does work just fine
2,shouldve gotten the original,"i mean its ok, but the original thigh master i shouldve gotten.when you use it, it hurts!"
2,do not waster your money,I recently purchased this & I was very disapointed.This Product seems strong but the ease of use is all bad.I tried to use it but it seemd to keep either bending or popping out.Really a waste of money.
3,its ok,"i decided to give this equipment a chance since i do sit around for hours at a time in my job.. i figured it wont hurt to do some kind of a work out and decided to try this...its ok... it doesnt work miracles if that what your expecting... it just works you enough to feel a bit of strain on you legs... i also use this for my arms and position it in a way where i can also work my core a little bit... its not bad for its price you definitely get what you pay for.definite CONS: it hurts after a while, its unstable, the black plastic in the middle where they hide the spring comes apart and cracks ( still usable but still an eyesore)all in all.. i would think of this more of a toy than a serious exercise equipment."
3,ehh its ok,"The product is fine, but not great. It doesn't have as much resistance as I was hoping for, and it's pretty uncomfortable to use. Better for arms for me than legs."
4,Not much resistance,"It's not very strong and it's constantly trying to turn itself sideways because of the configuration of the spring in the middle. It's okay if you're going to be sitting there for a movie or something, but takes a long time to feel any kind of burn and I have to hold the black middle piece the whole time to keep it from turning."
1,Unusable!,"This piece of junk is COMPLETELY USELESS! It does not what-so-ever stay between your legs and when you hold it there to make it, it torques ridiculously under pressure. There is no way anyone can use this, the design is awful, it doesn't make sense that someone would make this and sell it believing it could work. Did they not test this out? I'm still in shock that a manufacturer made this and thought it was acceptable. I could bend a hanger in half and get more use of it between my legs than this. I've wasted $10 because I just threw it away."
2,oh well!,"I purchased two, so my daughter and I could workout together. The item is flimsy and not the quality you would expect from a name brand company. The item is awkward to use."
1,No,"I have not yet used it to its full potential, I suppose. I found it a bit annoying to work out with. Nevertheless, I am going to give it another try."
1,Not enough resistance and uncomfortable on the inner thighs,"I was very excited to purchase this product, thinking that I can do this anywhere. Unfortunately, the handles are very wobblely and uncomfortable on the inner thigh, and may cause bruising, unless used with a towel wrapped over each of the handles. The resistance is minimal. The black piece in the middle is basically plastic. It would be a great exercise tool if they made the handles flat and made the resistance level adjustable. It wasn't a lot of money so I figure I got what I paid for and kept it."
4,Good tool for exercising under the desk !!,"If you are thinkin to use thigh toner while you are reading e-mails and talking on a phone in the office, the action with thigh toner is mach easier than pedaling squeaky mini-bike or up-and-down youe legs with weight(2.5 lb/ea).(That I was doing...) The resistance of ""Everlast for Her ..."" was PERFECT for me. I minused one star, for its appearance- a pad with wrinkles. Well, it is not a big deal,though."
4,Sparkly!,"While this certainly doesn't look like an expensive piece of jewelry and is clearly costume jewelry, it's quite pretty and I shall enjoy wearing it. It's very sparkly and fun, and the purple CZ is a beautiful color. And at that price? So affordable!"
5,Loads of fun!,We bought this game for my daughter and she really enjoys it. I've even played it myself and it is quite addictive :-)
2,The landscape is changing,"Alan, please go rejoin Depeche Mode. If not you then maybe Vince Clake.Blues and Electronia doesn't seem to work. Go and jumpstart the greatest electronic band of all times again."
2,BAD,"VERY LOWER LEVEL THAN EXPECTED...SORRY, ALAN, BUT I GUESS YOUR ARTISTIC ABILITIES ARE NOT SHOWN IN THIS ALBUM"
2,Sinks Under Its Own Pretensions,"Wilder's project, Recoil, sinks beneath its often pretentious ambitions to marry electronica with the New Orleans soul blues sound. Coming from a cold, Anglo Saxon, it sounds like a more desperate attempt to bridge some sort of unity with rich pop stars and the bereaved poor of NO. The album is mostly murky and gets absorbed in the background. Wilder sounds like another tony Londoner trying to take on more than he is capable. As far as being the soul of Depeche Mode, people forget the power of Gore's songs and Gahan's delivery. Wilder has always been a technician and not a musician. Technical prowess does not equal talent."
5,Good Celtic Wisdom for Life & the Planet,"The Mist-Filled Path is a book that seeks to heal. It offers healing to our connection to nature, understanding of our ancestral wounds, and seeks to heal our connections with each other. The reader of The Mist-Filled Path will be invited on a meaningful journey through a series of topics that hail from the Celtic vision of the spiritual life, but in a way that is alive and practical. One reviewer suggests that MacEwen's writing is PC (politically correct). On the contrary, I think his ideas are powerful and visionary. His words issue a call to us all to heal the divisions between us and to work toward a world of peace that includes nature again in our lives. This is not PC; this is wisdom. Expect more from this young man."
1,A weak book by a weakminded man.,"The mist filled path is filled with selfloathing White discriminatory politically correct idiocy.If one is writing a Celtic book then By the Gods be true to the Celts, Frank is not true to the Celts his ""supposed"" people.To sell out ones own people by shifting the blame of all the worlds ills upon them is the greatest of sins.He should maybe stop writing books and start working at the salvation army instead, perhaps he can then feel justified in being White."
2,Troggs - 'Live' (Rollercoaster) 2-CD import,"Sorry to have to admit that I was pretty let down with this 2-CD release.Disc one is a 42-minute live performance of the band with two original members,vocalist Reg Presley and guitarist Chris Britton.Even though the guys do their best on ""I Can't Control Myself"",their Buddy Holly cover ""Peggy Sue"",""Feels Like A Woman"" and ""Wild Thing"",it remains a fact that 'Live',disc one just doesn't make the grade.Plain and simple,it sounds weak and lifeless.However,maybe all isn't lost as disc two is a decent interview with Presley as he covers a variety of subjects.Plus the cover is quite a piece of work.STRICTLY for British invasion collectors and Troggs completists."
3,An OK Way to Waste 80 Minutes,"Station West is the story of a guy (Dick Powell) who goes to a western town to bring justice. Everytime a wealthy woman tries to move her gold, it gets stolen. Powell's job is to find out who is stealing it and bring them to justice. In the process he meets a crooked group including a beautiful woman (Jane Greer) who he needs to provide information.The film is utterly forgettable but holds one's interest throughout. Nothing too exciting or notable happens; the events are standard for western films.Powell is very good in his role as a tough good-guy. As a fan of Powell, I was able to ignore the western setting, but I would not recommend this film for those who don't like the genre."
3,cannot obtain service in Brazil,"length of band of the watch is too short and I cannot obtain service in Brazil, Authorized dealer (Vivara) says this is an outdated model.I just bought from Amazon. I do not know how to proceed."
5,Another Great Book!,"We are so happy to read this book! Tiptoes Lightly is our favorite fairy and my daughter was falling asleep curled as Jeremy Mouse for many nights! This book brought us more beautiful stories from our well-loved world of Tiptoes. Reading them while celebrating the very same festivals brings another dimension to the stories.But I just have to warn you about something!!! My daughter, who is almost 5, started making her own stories based on the one we have read. She also acts most of them - so our bedtime ""routine"" is much, much longer now :)"
5,"Wonderful, gentle tales","I was so excited to find this book. My children are very sensitive and it's been difficult to find quality stories that don't frighten them, so I was delighted to find a book full of gentle, imaginative stories that are absent the dark, thrilling (and frankly, sometimes scary) characters and situations common in many children's books these days. It's a bonus that my kids beg (literally beg) for another tale after I finish one. The chapters (or tales) work wonderfully as individual stories or read in succession. A great addition to any family or classroom library."
5,Celebrate with Tiptoes,"This is our second Tiptoes book and the second in the delightful series of magical tales by Reg Down about the little fairy named Tiptoes Lightly. In Festival of Stones, we follow the continuing adventures of Tiptoes and her animal, human and gnome companions through the fall and winter, including the many festivals of these seasons: Michaelmas, Halloween, Martinmas, Advent and Christmas. Although my children (4 and 6) attend a Waldorf school and it deepens their understanding of these festivals, the book is more than accessible to any preschool to early grade school child who loves stories about forest friends and celebrations. The lovely line illustrations are the perfect compliment to this chapter book. We usually read two chapters a night, often with a request for ""just one more."" The plot is easy to follow but varying enough to hold their attention night after night. We love this book and plan to revisit it year after year."
5,Festival of Stones,My 10 year old loves this book~now she reads it herself. Before I would read it to her before bed. Great book! Helps their imaginations flourish!
5,Wonderful artistry,This CD captures the artist at her peak. The concert is thoroughly enjoyable. A CD to be listened to again and again.
4,ChalkBoard Art,"I like the product, but it tends to be little streaky at times. It helped me with a Chalk Board piece I had to complete, but I would recommend practicting before using professionally."
1,will ruin your walls,"These pens will ruin your chalkboard painted wall. You can not get the imprint off. You will have to repaint. And the company agrees that they won't work on chalkboard paint on walls. Too bad they don't warn you on the package of their very expensive markers.from Chalk Ink company:Unless you have a very hard surface like a porcelain on steel board or a manufactured, baked surface, or a semi-gloss painted surface- you will always have that issue. Chalk paint is very porous and not hard so it is something that will need a regular touch up. It's the nature of the material."
2,Not what I expected,"I had read one or two of Gottfried Benn's medical poems in a poetry workshop. I loved them and bought this book thinking I'd discover more gems. Instead, I found myself challenged by language and construction that were, at best, obscure, and at worst, barely made sense, at least to me. Some of this problem might have had to do with the fact that the book translates essays and poems from German; perhaps some of the interpretations were awkward. Much of the content is also philosophical, which is not my cup of tea. Finally, it wasn't clear whether he was a Nazi sympathizer or not, and the ambiguity was unsettling. What was clear is that he identified strongly with whatever the national character was going through at the time the material was written, and that was the one aspect of the book that was provocative and compelling. I may still try to tough this one out, but it won't be easy."
5,No Other Beat Like This.,"This is a great song, and the beat, base and sound is awsome. Buy this and you wont be disapointed, it rules."
1,PD IZ SUCH A THEIF,FOR ONE THING IF IT WASNT FOR THE LUNIZ PUTTING THAT TRACK TOGHETHER FROM THE BEGINNING PUFFY WOULDNT EVEN HANVE A SONG. IM NOT A HATER BUT BAY LUV IZ IN THE HOUSE FO REAL THE SONG IS CALLED I GOT 5 ON IT.
1,Don't waste your money.,This book was a total waste of time and money. The book did not contain any tips for winning at poker.....just tales from the past.
1,waste of time,No secrets in this book....just some stories fron the 80's...don't waste your time or money buying this book.
5,Great Buy and Product,"This is the best buy on reeds. If you have family that play, buy them here. The product is the same as you buy in local stores and the shipping is super fast. Recommend to everyone :)"
5,Perfect in every way!,"This is an excellent score to Stargate, and the orchestra performs and sounds very good! This is, from what I can tell, the complete score, which I am also pleased with. Some of my favorite tracks are the overture, Slave Rebellion, Kasuf Returns, and the closing titles intro at the end of the soundtrack. Overall this is perfect in every way: sound, performance, melody, orchestration! A must-buy for every Stargate fan!"
5,Terrific!,"David Arnold has written a magnificent score. It is a thematically, lush score. It feels a cross between ""Lawrence of Arabia"" meets ""The Mummy"". I wish Arnold would do more film scores because he is a rare talent among the new crop of composers out there that can't seem to make any score thematically memorable. Arnold definitely can. His style is in the league of Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, Maurice Jarre, etc... Excellent score!"
3,"It just a magazine reprint - it's a good article, though","This is just a reprint of a 5-page article from Harvard Business Review, January, 2001. It's a good article, though, but it's not a ""book"" in any respect. It only covers the ""peer review"" aspect of a 360."
4,An entertaining read,"A well done story of a truly fascinating man, perhaps the only thing that could have made it better if it were a bit longer."
1,All of the ones we bought will not hold a charge.,We bought about 8 or 12 of these AA batteries marked DIGITAL. They will charge and show 1.25v on a volt meter but they have no LOAD capacity. We tried running them in a remote control truck and they would not move the tires. When the load hit the batteries they failed to push the truck. I have been throwing these away. Right now I've got 2 in front of me and they are headed to the trash can. We can charge them for 2 days and they still have no load capacity.
3,Batteries would not hold a charge,"I ordered 3 sets of batteries. I charged two sets, and neither set would work after charging. All the batteries had some corrosion on the bases, so I'm assuming they were old.Amazon made it very easy to return the batteries for a full refund, and didn't charge me to ship them back. This is a very good service.This is really the first negative experience I have had with Amazon, and I have ordered many, many times. I will continue to do so. They do stand behind their products."
4,A good one this time,"This book seemed to get back on track after the disappointment of the previous book (Check Out Time). I love the characters in this series, and this book lets us get to see them a lot more. Of course the maid Gertie is my favourite, but I love to watch the interplay between Cecily and Baxter as well. Cecily and Baxter are trying to solve another mystery that seems to involve their hotel. Young gypsy women are being murdered in the woods beside the hotel, and they are being discovered without their heads. And an axe seems to keep going missing from the hotel's woodshed. This is a fun series with wonderful characters set in the Georgian time period. I would recommend it to anyone who likes cozies."
2,Read reviews before watching,"I am thankful I read the reviews before watching the film. Watching the film without the reviews would result in mass confusion. Reading the reviews first makes the film watchable. For example, one scene a white woman with blonde hair jumps out the window but through the window a short dark skinned man with a mustach and grey wig comes through the window and then changes back to the woman. Put it in slow motion and it is great. So many other classic scenes that are only good if you know they are coming. Vampires hop like bunnies until they fight. Movie is two movies spliced into one so the transition of scenes make no sense. A side character who we really have little to no information on becomse the robo cop. He somehow has jedi powers in scenes where he uses the force to obtain his weapon. If you can find it for $2 or less get it. If not, avoid."
1,the good the bad and the ugly,"If you like bad movies, laughably bad movies, then robovampire is a film for you. It is simultaneously a good, bad, and downright ugly film. However, if you have seen robovampire and are looking for another film like it, devils dynamite will disappoint. I would suggest catman: lethal track, it is not quite the exhibition of poor film making that robovampire manages to be but it has its moments. In conclusion, I suggest buying robovampire by itself if possible."
3,Interesting,"You at least have to hand it to Ms. Eaglen for doing Wagner and Bellini. It's wonderful that someone still finds it important to do both, realizing how much a Wagnerian performance can benefit from some bel canto proficiency. Still, the Bellini just seems a little limp. In interviews, Ms. Eaglen seems like a humorous, opinionated, forthright person, but these qualities don't come across in this recording. However, if your main interest is a Valkyrie warcry complete with trills as written, you won't be disappointed."
2,Disapointed,"When I first bought this recording I was very impressed by Eaglen singing of Bellini and Wagner. But after listening to singers as Callas, Sutherland, Nilsson she sounds inadequate.I don't no why she thinks she can pull this off. The person who wrote that Eaglen's Norma was the best must be out his mind.I whas also stupid enough to buy her recording of Turandot. Eaglen and O'neil both sound awful on that recording. The only Eaglen recording I can recommend is her Tosca. Forget everything else."
3,Vocally secure but no Maria Callas,"My husband & I find it impossible not to admire Ms. Eaglen's tonal beauty, her ease of production. How difficult this music is, and how one must have to love it to pieces to dare approach it. But after listening to the Pirata piece (Col sorriso d'innocenza) three times in succession, we brought out Callas, for *dramatic* coloratura---sung with accents, layers of meaning, exquisite rhythm, and musical and dramatic momentum. One one hand, a scene; on the other, a entire panorama of sound and meaning...But we sense that Ms. Eaglen has the capability to fine-tune. We'd feel we'd be foolish to give up on her, so we shall not. By any rational standard, she is a rarity in today's age, thus not to be dismissed out-of-hand. Also, she deserves better conductors, who will keep her voice ""out front"". Is there a Tullio Serafin lurking in the house?"
5,Stunning,Bellini and Wagner at their BestI was just listening to The Immonlation Scene in gotterdammerung and teared upJane Eaglen is absolutley brilliant
5,Great Read!,"I didn't read the first book from this author, but this one was a good, succinct telling of an interesting story. I'll be looking for him again."
3,A new author for me.,"My first book by Gabbay. The book is not bad, he appears to be a good writer, the book is easy to read, the characters are mildly entertaining, the book is a great period piece and captures the period nicely. Lisbon during and just before WWII must have been a fascinating place. Lots of intrigue and spies. This book has something of the movie Casablanca."
5,UNDERRATED TALENT,"IF WE HAD MORE ALBUMS LIKE THIS,R&B WOULD BE SO COMPLETE.THIS ALBUM IS PLATINUM MATERIAL.I GUESS IT WAS PROBABLY SLEPT ON"
1,Has problems keeping a stable temperature,"After a few weeks of accurate operation this heater became very flaky, first running my aquarium up to a very high temperature and then becoming inconsistent at any temperature setting.I am surprised all of the reviews of this product here on Amazon are generally favorable, a number of people have had the same problem I had, you can read about it at Marinedepot.com.Would not recommend this heater, its not worth the risk to your tank."
4,It is a heater,"Turned it on, it warmed the water, perfect :) but with all things, not every single item made can be perfect and there are bad apples in every batch, If you need a heater of this size, this one is very nice. Mine has had no issues defects or problems."
1,Mine broke in the tank,"It somehow cracked and broke in the tank (sometime at night when everyone was alseep). I work up to find my fish tank completely shutdown because it tripped the circuit breaker. Looks like I probably only lost one fish, but they were all hiding so I'll know for sure later. Not sure how this would happen, but I'm not buying this heater again."
1,Do Not Deal With This Company,"My Hydor heater malfunctioned (overheated) two months after purchase, killing $150 worth of fish. Per their instructions, I spent $13 returning the heater to them, asking for a refund including shipping and handling. Instead, they sent a replacement that I won't use."
4,Not bad..,"Like most of the other reviewers have pointed out, the temp on the knob is inaccurate. A little bit of common sense and an accurate thermometer will get it set up in no time. Each click is about 2 degrees F. No issues with temp fluctuations or the thermostat sticking. I don't care for its overall appearance in the tank. There's some sort of graphic design near the top that makes this heater hard to hide in the back ground. My pleco likes it so I gave it an extra star. I would not buy another one but I would recommend this heater to someone that needs a solid-performing heater that's cheap."
1,Disappointed,"After buying the Hydor power heads, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this company. I was very disappointed when I installed my heater, set the temperature to 78, and came back a couple hours later to find that my water was at 84 degrees! To try and counter this, I unplugged it, let the temperature settle back down to about 74 degrees. Plugged the heater back in, set the temp to 72. Came back a couple hours later, water was at 79. I double checked to make sure that I ordered the correct size, and wattage (which it was). Stick with the power heads, avoid the heaters."
1,NO GOOD!,"After 8 months, the heater stopped working. We kept very good maintenance, too. This is a waste of $; go with a heater with a warranty!"
4,"No complaints, here.","the product arrived promptly and works fine. It does what is supposed to do and keeps my tank warm, which is about 40-50 gallons, even though I keep the air conditioner on all day. I recommend, just make sure this heater is suitable for your size tank."
4,"IS THE ""MILK"" SONG ON THIS DVD?",i was wondering if the milk song was on this dvd. i'm a big fan of the music and i can't find out if it is on this dvd anywhere i look...
3,Feel like I got scammed,"I purchased both Volume 1 & 2 expecting to get the straight run of episdoes. Instead, you get one episode/season/per disc + a few snippets of popular songs. I must've missed this information while researching these DVDs. I am returning both immediately and I'm very disappointed."
3,"Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 (1969-1974)",I LOVE Sesame Street! My husband and I enjoyed watching the episodes that we grew up with and then again there were other episodes that were missing too. Hopefully I will not be disappointed when I purchase Volume II.
3,Brings back memories but....,"I was so excited when I saw this was finally available. Put it in the DVD player and.... major disapointment. It is chopped up, there aren't really any ""episodes"" and it was so short for the price paid. But, I still will try another ""season"""
2,Disappointed with Sesame Street Old School Volume 1,"I was so happy to finally be able to see the old Sesame Street. I even told my grown kids to plan on a Sesame Street Night to relive the fun & introduce their kids to the beginnings of Sesame Street.When I viewed the 1st disc I was only a little disappointed to see the entire 1st episode. There were even repeats within the episode. What I expected from the discription was a montage of excerpts from the 1st season: the whole 1st season, not just one episode.Disc 2 was the same way: just 2 complete episodes; there were even repeats. And disc 3 was boring. I fast-forwarded through most of it.The best parts of the 3 discs were the cut-outs.Truthfully I was anticipating Volume 2 and also the Electric Company. However, I guess those volumes will only contain 1 or 2 episodes of each season. What a disappointment with all the possiblities of each year.S. Markel"
5,Excellent and worth buying,"As a child of the seventies reared on Sesame Street, I always found that it supported my own early interest in reading and books. As a parent of two young children, I have really enjoyed watching the shows with my children and discussing the material. The content is smart, explained carefully and very nostalgic while keeping diversity and well-being at the center. At first I was disappointed that every episode of all seven seasons was not represented, the first episode of each of the first five years is there. Then, on each disk, there are the greatest moments of the seasons that can be watched and enjoyed - quite a lot - seven and a half hours in all. I have watched all of the segments out of interest and have found that both of my children - age five and age one love them."
3,Too Few Episodes,"I adore classic Sesame Street. I it's much more clever, educational, and charming than today's show/ other children's educational shows. The ""warning"" at the beginning of the episodes, saying the dvds are for adult entertainment purposes is ridiculous.I'm only giving 3 stars because I think it's crummy there are only 5 episodes. The bonus features are fun but don't count for much. For $22 (on sale from $40!) there should be more episodes. Netflix online gives you 12 episodes and YouTube has playlists of your favorite characters. [...] will take you to the playlist page.I will most likely end up getting the other old school collections because my son loves them so much, but definitely not at full price and probably used."
3,First DVD,"The DVD is a good DVD, but I was disappointed for several reasons. For one, they left a lot of good stuff out of the first DVD. Second, they repeated several skits (if we want to see them over, we can play them as many times as we want...so I feel that it was a waste of DVD space.) I also wish that they would continue to release classic Sesame Street DVDs in a timely matter."
5,Sesame Street DVD,This is a great DVD. The booklet that comes with it has a lot of great information about that time period and the show. It arrived very quickly!
1,Very disappointed - only 5 shows.... Not complete ....Buyer beware,The shows they have on the 3 DVDs on Vol. 1 only show a total of five programs .....not the complete series of programs from 1969 - 1974 as advertised. I was very disappointed in the selection for the money paid. Had thought Sesame Street name meant more or maybe it is A Sony business plan for profits. So read all the info before purchasing.I had also bought Volume 2 and Volume 3 .... For a total of $80.76 you get a very few shows....not the complete set of shows. Again......buyer beware this is not all shows from 1969 - 1974.
3,Not what expected,"I loved seeing the old skits that I remembered and loved as a child. I was so excited to share them with my children. But, I expected a complete library of all their skits from 1969-1974. They only included a few letters and numbers, and even repeated some of the skits which irritated me. I didn't pay to see the same skit about the number 2 three times and the letter D twice. My kids still love them, but I was disappointed with the collection."
4,True old school fans will love it.,"If you watched the show as a kid anytime before the 90's , you'll love it. It has the great humor that fits not only children but adults as well. (wasn't that the point after all?) Loved it. Can't wait for the next few dvds."
4,great set--but confused about something...,"First, I have to say how thrilled I am to finally see this on DVD. My 4 year old son has now memorized all his favorite sketches.I was just wondering if anyone else noticed that the Wanda the Witch sketch plays twice during the first episdoe. I just want to make sure my disk isn't defective.As far as the disclaimer, I was a little surprised when I saw it. I guess it's just how times have changed. I think the ""Over, Through and Around"" is probably one of the big reasons for it. Nothing like a bunch of kids crawling through pipes and playing on a construction site! Ah, the good old days."
2,Missing too many episodes!!!,I would pay a lot of money for a complete set of the ENTIRE series for 1970-1979. Why doesn't someone make one for each year and make it COMPLETE. Buying it this way was a disappointment and a tease. I would do ANYTHING and pay A LOT to find all the episodes for the 70s as I don't want my child to have anything to do with Elmo.
3,a good past time kids television show,"This volume is very different; since Oscar the Grouch is orange in the beginning of the television show...normally he's green. The introductary segments are very new to me, since they don't show kids running, playing in the structures or ridding on a animal. Other than this the show is entertaining to the eye...unusual."
4,old school rocks,this is a great set if u wanna go down memory lane..and I mean way down memory lane - in this piticular volume the episodes included were around and airing before I even existed but I was curious how it all started and it has been interesting - though I thought I would have more episodes than I discovered - turns out its one episode 4 every year - and a few extras but never the less its sesame street so how can u go wrong right - I recommend it 4 stars cause I felt jiped on episode count but other wise I'm luvin it :)
3,Sesame Street Old School Vol. 1 (1969-1974),"Although the product is of good quality, I was dissappointed in the very few daily episodes included in the set."
3,Sesame Street DVDs Volume I,"I was a little disappointed by this DVD set. I thought we would receive more than 5 full length episodes of the first 5 years Sesame Street was on TV. I do like all the highlights that include all the songs that are on the Platinum Greatests Hits CD that my daughter sings along with. I also wish that the viewer warning, These are not intended for young children, but rather for the parents to enjoy, was listed in the seller description."
3,A Good Start...,"I bought this because I have a toddler daughter who was starting to be exposed to the evil that is Elmo and wanted her to grow up with a Sesame Street that focused on learning and not merchandising.I love the episodes that are included on this set. I hate that they only include 5 full episodes. It is really inconvenient to have to flip through the ""extras"" menus just to see some clips that are buried in the episodes without tags, or that were in episodes that didn't merit airing in their entirety. Why couldn't they just have done what every other TV show in the world has done, releasing complete seasons?In summary, this is a nice stroll down a small stretch of memory lane, but it could have been so much more."
1,FIVE episodes -- definitely NOT worth it,"Like other reviewers, I THOUGHT I had read the description carefully, but apparently I didn't. I thought that a few years ago I had seen complete Sesame Street seasons DVDs at my friend's house. So I went searching for them for my son. I put these on my son's Christmas wish list and he received both volumes 1 and 2 as gifts for Christmas. I wish I had read closer and not opened both of them up. I put Vol 1 Disc 1 in the DVD player and couldn't figure out how to navigate to the rest of the episodes on the menu. Oh, that's right--because you CAN'T. There is ONE episode on the whole disc. So, be forewarned, these are NOT COMPLETE SEASONS. I'm very disappointed. For this price I would expect complete seasons, not 5 measly episodes. Now I'm sorry my family wasted their money on these."
3,Why no closed captions?,"This is all good stuff, but it's confusing that no one thought it would be worth going back in and adding closed captions to the shows: They've been added for re-released sitcoms from the 1970s; surely it'd be worth adding to an educational DVD set that the whole family might watch together.That said, it's a lot of fun -- the orange Oscar the Grouch was a shock -- and definitely worth getting."
4,Fun to watch,"Check out the pilot episode that started it all! If you grew up on the show like me, then this is great fun to watch. I'll always swear by the original series - political incorrectness and all. Cause it was funny AND educational."
1,Sickening,"This show is disgusting. It is filled with sexual content, racism, bestiality, necrophilia, nasty fetish scenes, heavy petting and attractive teenage girls in bikinis. In one gut-wrenching scene, Big Bird and Ernie spewed several racial slurs to a little girl and then sucked on her toes!!! THIS SHOULD NOT BE SHOWN TO LITTLE KIDS. Also, Cookie Monster is a horrible example for young children! Vegetable Monster would've been a much better idea. Avoid this piece of filth and show your kids Full House or anything with Bob Saggot instead."
5,I was small when Sesame Street started!!!,"I grew up watching Sesame Street when it was in it's heyday!!! I sure am glad it is still on the air!! I first watched it in 1970!!!I grew out of watching it in 1976. Then realizing that Jim Henson's Muppets were the big stars of that show, I missed it after a while. Then watching The Muppet Show in the late 1970s, I saw Kermit the Frog again!! I even watched Mister Rogers, Zoom, and The Electric Company during my childhood on television station KPBS TV channel 15 in San Diego where I grew up and live. I was 2 when Sesame Street debuted in 1969!! It makes me think I might want to buy this product for my new nephew!!!"
3,"Wonderful, but disc 2 has a defect","I'm a big fan of this set of episodes (no Elmo or Zoe, yay!), but on Disc 2 the Play All function does not work, so you have to play each 2-3 minute clip separately, which is annoying if you aren't sitting right next to your child while watching. Disc 2 is essentially useless to us."
4,NOT FOR VERY YOUNG UNDER 1YR,I BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDSON EIGHT MONTHS. THE PICTURE IS TOO OLD NOT COLORFUL.BUT FOR OLDER KIDS LOTS OF EDUCATIONAL TOOLS
5,Sesame Street DVD,"It's a great package deal and the episodes are from way, way back when. It kinda made me feel old. But in a good way."
4,Great stuff,"This DVD has some great stuff on it. Of course, I wanted more, but I enjoyed the content that was provided."
1,Used Item?,"This was not shrink-wrapped and looked used. I was trying to buy a NEW DVD. I was not pleased at all, and I have not re-ordered."
2,Not as great as I thought it would be:(,"The product's description made it sound like there would be several episodes on each disk, but really its one to two episodes per disk. The quality of the film is pretty fuzzy & even somewhat blurry. The drawing that does the announcement is really annoying, luckily you can skip over him. I bought this for my young son, and while he likes it- I'm thinking I should have went with the newer episodes. I was really excited about buying the vintage episodes, but having seen them now I probably wouldn't buy them for a child, maybe an adult that would remember them the original time they aired."
1,"Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1","I was very disappointed with this DVD. I thought the DVD would be full of the original episodes, but there were only five. I thought it would contain at least a whole season."
3,Kind of Boring,"While my 15 month old son loves the extra bits on the first DVD (""Bein' Green"", ""Rubber Duckie"", ""I Love Trash"" & ""ABC-DEF-GHI""), he much prefers the DVD's ""A CELEBRATION OF ME- GROVER"" & ""ELMO'S SING ALONG GUESSING GAME""."
1,slurprised,I raised my child on the original Sesame Street and as a kindergarten teacher my class watched a bit of it each day.I was surprised and unhappy that the DVD was not digitally remastered. It was fuzzy and not fun to watch. I just expected more from The Childrens Workshop.I had planned to purchase the next release. I am not too sure that I will now;
1,"SS -Old School, Vol. 1","Very dissappointed in the quality of these CD's They have NOT been re-done at all, the pictures are so grainy and hard to see my grandaughter won't watch it. Don't waste your money."
1,Where's Stevie?,I want the complete episode with Stevie Wonder. Check out YouTube to see what I mean. You'll be blown away.
2,Old School Sesame Street is Just That,"This product will not appeal to today's children. I did not know that prior to buying it, but when my three year old daughter had no interest in watching it, I decided to see why. Once I started to watch the video with her, the narrator came on and said that this product was for adults and would not appeal to today's pre-school age children. He was right and that could be because the children of today are over stimulated and Old School Sesame Street does not stimulate them. If you have fond memories of waching the Sesame Street characters of old, and believe your children will too, let me warn you that they will not and you will be wasting your money on nostalgia."
2,it's too old,My 3 yr old dau rec'd this as a xmas present last year and she didnt much care for it - i guess the graphics and special effects were dated for her - she's a huge fan of the new ones we catch on tv.I definitely wouldn't recommend this for children of the 21st century - it's too dated. She does on the other hand LOVE all the old muppet shows my hubby and i grew up watching.
2,"Good material, for what's there","As a viewer of the original series, I was looking forward to giving the same SS experience to my kids (today's ""Street"" is too scattered when it' not focused on the over marketed Elmo). Unfortunately, only a few of the classic episodes made it onto this set. I am a little dissappointed at this, so - 2 stars for quality, but minus three stars for lack of content."
5,Good Stuff!,"A few weeks ago, I rented the documentary ""The World According to Sesame Street"". I had caught bits and pieces of the show on PBS every now and then, but never really saw the whole thing. Thoroughly enjoyed the video and it prompted me to visit Amazon to see if it was available for purchase and to check out what else was available on the subject. Didn't find the DVD, but I did find the book - ""Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street"" so I ordered it. I also ordered this DVD set ""Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 (1969-1974)"" to watch as a companion to the book. It was a great decision, many of the early first year videos discussed in the book are in the set, as well as the original sales pitch film. I recommend both the book and the video set."
4,WHEN SESAME STREET WAS AT IT'S BEST(A Few Edits though),"This is when Sesame Street was at it's absolute best! But, there are a few edits from what I remember. One is how they cut the song Consider Yourself in episode 1 right after Gordon finishes putting faces on the anything muppets. Instead it fades out after he puts the faces on. WHAT A SHAME. There is also a suprise (easter egg) SPOILER HERE: On disc 1 on the special features menu, above the words old school is little bird. Keep playing around on your remote until little bird is highlighted in red and click enter to see a photo gallery of concept drawings, and stage pictures. There are a few more edits I didn't mention but the Consider Yourself one is enough to knock the dvd down to 4 stars. So I recomend this dvd but BE WARNED OF SEVERAL EDITS."
2,not worth the money,There are not many shows on each CD. It is not worth the money. There should be a lot more shows on these CD's for this price. It seems that there could be a whole lot more in that since there were a lot of sesame street shows during these years.
3,Okay,"We enjoyed the nostalgia, however, expected more episodes. It's dated but still wholesome entertainment for our child."
2,Not what I expected,This dvd set only includes the first show of 5 seasons. 5 Sesame shows in all. Not worth the price even if the education benefits are definitely present.
4,Flashback City,"Boy, did this bring back memories! At 32 years I still remembered singing the ""Ladybug Picnic"" and the ""Adventures of Letterman""! This is an awesome series and if you watched it when you were a kid there is no reason you can't enjoy it now. Your kids will love it too!"
4,Finding my way back to Sesame Street,It was soooooooo wonderful revisiting my childhood with this dvd set. Sesame Street had so many creative tools to get across the basic building blocks of learning. There is absolutely nothing out there now that compares to the show that was Sesame Street in the early 1970s. My three year old watched the shows with me and fell in love with the same characters that I grew up with. I am ready to buy Volume 2. The reason why I didn't give it five stars is tat I truly believe that there should have been at least three full shows on each disc.
4,Education is difficult,"This product is great for learning how to teach. I am observing what techniques Sesame Street uses to teach young children and am learningwhat are some good techniques. It's also interesting to see what was used to teach kids from the early 1970s. Plus, it's still a hilarious show for adults to watch."
3,Heartbreaking,"This really should be a five-star item: Sesame Street always brings back great memories and is fun to watch with my kids. The prospect of sharing the ""Old School"" Sesame Street shows from my childhood was very exciting.When this DVD set arrived today, I immediately put a disk in, only to find the whole family would not be able to enjoy the show: this DVD set is not closed-captioned for the hearing impaired (as was listed when I purchased the set), nor is it subtitled in English or any language.We'll end up returning the set and missing out on what would have been a great experience for the whole family."
4,Wonderful but...,"Looking at Sesame Street from then and now all I can say is WOW!!! My wife and I were watching the first disk today with my 7 month old son, and all I can say is that my oldest son missed out on some great learning material. Today's Sesame Street does not even compare to the SS that us 30 somethings grew up with. We actually learned from the ""Old School"" Sesame Street, not like today where the whole show is centered around a red monster who refers to himself in the third person. What kind of nonsense are they trying to teach our kids today with that? A wonderful set except it would have been real sweet if they had included more episodes in the set, my reason for this set not getting five stars. Other than that, the Old School Sesame Street is the REAL educational program not this imitation rip off PBS program that's devoid of educational content being shown today."
4,The Yankees aren't the only Bombers from the Bronx.,"Friday night July 15,2005,the Orleans Casino in Las Vegas, Mr. Dimucci,better known as Dion takes the stage. After going through familiar hit after familiar hit the band takes a break and leaves Dion alone on the stage with just an acoustic guitar. Dion then proceeds to knock out the audience with one blues number after another. when he's done you say to yourslf when is he going to put that type of singing and playing on a cd. Sure enough someone upstairs is listening. You play the cd for the first time and can't get over how great it is. By the 15th play your totally in love with the songs both the singing and guitar playing. The only remaining question is when will part 2 be released?"
3,"BLUES ALBUM OF THE YEAR !!!!!! ""NO DOUBT ABOUT IT""","IN 1961 I PICKED UP A DION ALBUM ""FROM A COUNTER TOP BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO"", AND HAVE BEEN HOOKED EVER SINCE. THIS IS BEYOND A DOUBT THE BEST BLUES ALBUM OF THE YEAR. HOW THIS DID NOT WIN A GRAMMY IS BEYOND ME. WHERE ELSE CAN YOU HAVE THE HISTORY OF THE BLUES ON ONE CD AND HAVING THE ""MAN FROM THE BRONX"" PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER BRONX STYLE? HIS VOICE IS STILL GREAT AND HIS ARTHUR AVE. ATTITUDE IS STILL THERE. ""NO DOUBT ABOUT IT."" EVERY SONG IS A KILLER: WHO DO YOU LOVE/CROSSROADS/ HONKEY TONK BLUES/BUILT FOR COMFORT. THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY COLLECTION. A WISE MAN ONCE STATED: ""YOU CAN TAKE THE KID FROM THE BRONX, BUT YOU CAN""T TAKE THE BRONX FROM THE KID."" GOD BLESS DION DIMUCCI - THE KING OF THE NEW YORK STREETS!!!!!!"
5,Dion,All been said before. Go out and get all of Dions back catalogue. I play them regularly on my radio shows here in Perth Australia
3,Another Pretty Good Blues Outing,"It seems as though everyone wants to jump on the Blues bandwagon these days; with mixed success. I have always liked Dion and this is a competent if somewhat hackneyed performance. However, it seems to lack the raw emotion of a true blues man or woman, and that's what the Blues are all about. I like it but prefer the originals. (PS-a D- to Bob Schnieders for his liner notes-calling ""I Let my Baby Do That"" a Dion original is unforgivable; he owes Hattie Hart a BIG apology. If you want to hear it done properly check out Rory Block's Version on ""Gone Woman Blues"") Anyway, if you are new to the blues this is a good introduction to a lot of the old standards."
3,For dedicated fans and blues lovers only,"Dion albums are few and far between these days and as one who followed his career though ""Teenager in Love"" to ""Abraham Martin & John"" and ""King of the New York Streets"", any new recording has to join the collection. That said, it's a more subdued DiMucci on this collection of blues tunes that were his first musical influences. It was recorded in two days with just Dion and Bob Guertin on drums and percussion, so it couldn't be more bare stripped. Let's just say it won't be discarded, but equally won't be among my top-played Dion CD's."
5,Dion .. never a disappointment,"what can I say ?? .. Dion is never a disappointment when he makes an album. No matter what genre, the man is great. I don't like rap music, but if he made one I would buy it !! By all means, buy this CD. I borrowed it from the library and took it to work with me. I thoroughly enjoyed it .. over and over again. Great Stuff !!"
1,AM radio junk,"I bought this based on reviews and that was a mistake. This is AM radio crap. I kept thinking a real blues guitar would kick in but that never happens.All sounds the same ,very nasal ,I mean this really stinks!!!!!!!!"
4,DION gets to the root of the blues,"His roots...when he heard Robert Johnson, Charley Patton, and other originators of the genre...Dion had to do this album. It was in him for years, but labels, producers and others he should have ignored would not let him do it, probably. Just Dion, his guitar and a little more here and there....GET IT."
5,old muso's keep getting better,"Having been a fan of Dion's from the Belmont days it's amazing to hear him singing the blues....the mother of most modern rock,pop and folk.Classy rich tones and smooth phrasing makes this a definite must have album.Sparse backing sounds enables the listener to hear a true vocalist who entertains with his range and interpretation of classic songs.Buy it ...you won't be sorry."
5,A great acoustic blues album,"I really liked this album a lot. Great guitar and singing. He has a nice vibe going here and there is nothing to complain about. This is the best or one of the best acoustic blues albums that I have heard. All the tunes are done well. For comparison, I like Jerry Ricks, John Jackson, Precious Bryant and Etta Baker and similar performers. I like this album as well or better than any of theirs. Hope that Dion does some more in this vein as I am not a fan of his other music, inventive and orginal as it may be. Very good blues."
5,Blues north of mason-dixon,"I'm a huge Dion fan and this album still surprised me by how great it was. I've heard many of these tracks played by both the original artists and in cover versions, but Dion clearly understands and is motivated by the feeling behind these songs, particularly the Robert Johnson tunes. I was doubly surprised by his own guitar work as I always think of him foremost as a singer and songwriter. One of my favorite albums this year worth many repeat listens."
5,"Dion is for real, this is the record of a mature artist","Dion go to the masters and he does it with respect .He knows what he's doingand deliver amazing vocal performances ( anyway , is not that what he always does ?) and very good guitar playing . This is the kind of record that can have several repeated listenings, that is based in respect for afro-american culture and tradition and is soulful and meaningful.If Dion keep releasing records like this , wow! what's coming next?"
5,He Just Keeps on Keepin' On,"I saw Dion a couple of years ago in San Diego. Here's a guy, 67 years old, who will just not fade away. His musical recordings have delved into several genres of music. He's truly an artist, in every sense of the word. He doesn't seem to care if his music reaches the charts or not, rather he is more interested in testing his abilities and sailing into uncharted waters. His life certainly has movie written all over it and Hollywood would be remiss if they didn't do a biopic on his life. This newest album is just another link in his fabulous musical career. It's the music he grew up with, along with country. Remember, there was no rock 'n roll when Dion was growing up, he helped invent it! I like this album!"
5,A really great blues CD,This stripped down treatment by a master singer is truly a work of art. The musicians who originally wrote these songs would be proud of the manner in which they were recorded.
5,Great Album,This is Dion like never before. A great set of evocative blues songs and gifted guitar playing. Every tune a winner. All classics. Even my husband loves it.
5,Better Than He Was 40 Years Ago!,"Dion Dimucci's ""Bronx In Blue"" showcases a talent that has matured over the years as well or better than any fine wine. The voice is strong. The choice of material and arrangements are first rate--listen to several other releases of ""Who Do You Love?"" and you'll settle on Dion's every time. You'll also discover that he's an excellent guitar player--something we had no way to know in the under-three-minute days of early Rock and Roll.""Bronx In Blue"" is a great tribute to the blues, and to its origins in the Old South. Its only flaw is that there isn't enough of it."
5,Bravery beyond the call of duty,"An acoustic blues album from a 66 year old white boy who is still remembered by the less informed music fans as a bumptious do-wopper could have been a complete disaster. Dion has always been confident in his ability to ring the changes and still sound authentic and his albums from 1989's Yo Frankie onwards have all been different-and brilliant. Too many guitar hero veterans have tried to ressurect flagging careers by turning too the blues with varying degrees of sincerity. Dion gives the blues a Bronx slant and someone listening to it blind would know instantly who the singer is.D, if you read this please be very sure that England awaits you!!"
2,Didn't fit my bike,"The problem was the angle wasn't correct, so the legs didn't reach the ground. The bottom of my frame was slanted in a way that didn't work this this unit.Nothing against this product, but there was no way to adjust it..."
5,"good stand, good price, fast shipping","This is a good well made stand, the little caps on the leg ends needed to be glued on to keep them in place but it works well and holds up my 150 lb. motorized bike just fine. Nice heavy metal construction."
3,Its not the best out there and no top plate,"I have ordered 3 double kickstand so far. The sunlight, the M-wave, and the Pletscher. The Pletscher is by far the best. Here is how I rank them.#1 Pletscher: Swiss Made engineering wonder. Has everything needed to install and works excellent#2 M-wave: has a top plate and works ok seemed sturdy on my bike, but had to replace the allen bolt with hex. Made in china#3 Sunlite: no top plate (OK if you have a mounting bracket) higher build quality than the M-wave but lower functionality. Hangs lower, and really only designed for bikes with mounting brackets."
4,2nd unit bought,Installed on my new bike. it is a little close to the ground and the feet touch when I turn a tight corner.
4,Does the Job,"I bought this center kick stand for my motorized Beach Cruiser. The stand appears to be made well and supports my Heavy bike complete with 80cc motor & gas tank. I did have to glue on rubber feet on the tips of kick stand but that was no problem. My bike was a little tall for stand so I added flat washers to the top to make the stand taller and raise my bike up about an inch or so higher. Bike stands upright level and does not fall over. The clearance in the tuck position is good and has no issues. Gave my motorized bike a more motorcycle look, and people have told me it looks good when bike is parked along with other bikes."
4,"Robusto, sencillo, fuerte, Dahon, Vitesse","Muy buen producto se ve robusto y le quedo bien a mi bicicleta Dahon Vitesse subo más fotos par que revisen el resultado, el detalle es que esta un poquito grande para la bicicleta plegable, pero para una normal esta perfecto..."
3,good at first then got wobbly,"i am a 100% commuter, don't ever drive, don't own a stinky car, i haul mega wattage groceries on my bike, when loading the groceries in my panniers i hated how my old kickstand (very strong and sturdy) was allowing my bike to list to the left, so when i saw this i was stoked. and at first i was happy. it has slowly gotten loose and I'm not sure what to do, i contacted the company but no response (coupla wks ago) i'll probly buy something from YUBA they make cargo bikes."
5,Solution for motorized or heavily loaded bicycles,This kickstand solves the instability problem associated with heavy bicycles. I installed it on my Bionx converted electric powered Trek and my gas powered(Dimension Edge) Dahon Folding Bike. I no longer have to worry about them falling over.
5,KICKSTAND IS GREAT!!!!!,"When building an electric bicycle we needed a substantial kickstand -- this fit the bill nicely.about 50 pounds in batteries, before we climb on - so it does have a lot of weight to hold securely, and does it well."
2,Not quite right.,"First of all, it comes with bolts to attach to the bike, but no top plate! I had to rummage on ebay to find one. If your bike is like most mainstream American bikes, it has no built-in kickstand mount, so you'll need to find a top plate to get this thing mounted.Second, it has a tendency to bang into my cranks, so I have to keep it tilted at a very special angle.Lastly, one of the rubber feet fell off. The design is clearly poor in this regard -- there's no way the designers could have expected those tiny rubber caps to stay on for very long.I recommend checking out Velo Orange's porteur kickstand."
3,Good quality BUT,"I love the look of the stand , the price was fine and it seems sturdy enough. It could use bigger feet with a flat side.. BUT before one buys a double kickstand look at your mounting plate or the bars where they will mount. If you have a bike where there is a substantial upward slope where your mounting will be then this item will not be recommended. Your bike will kick down and over too easily because they don't offer any wedges to compensate for the angled mounts on various bikes. Look for an adjustable one or one that has more of a slant to the left. You'll save yourself lost money and frustration not to mention damaging your bike and goods."
4,Too Short for 26inch wheels,"Good company. Their product details need more clarification. I might not have bought this product if I knew it it does not quite fit a 26"" wheeled bike. It teeters a little. Still works okay if you JerryRig it a little. Product looks good, Nice and heavy."
1,Not as good as I expected,"Based on the other customer reviews, I was very confident about this purchase. Big mistake. I have had this kickstand for about 10 weeks and I am looking around for a replacement. The rubber end caps both fell off within a couple of weeks, but that was minor compared to the overall poor performance of this kickstand. It could not support the weight of my bike and was too short for both feet to make contact with the ground together. Maybe this would work on a smaller bike, but I can't say I ever thought of my bike as anything but average sized..."
1,Will not work with Electric Bike with Batteries,"I read a review saying it worked well with electric bikes, not true, very unstable, don`t waste your money on it."
2,Great idea but too short,"I love the idea of the double support stand which makes parking a heavy bike very convenient. I have a tandem bike. When installed as is the bike is only supported one one side because the legs are too short. I have 26"" wheels. I added 3/4"" of washers to create a spacer. Now it works as it should. My rear wheel is off the ground by 1/2"" and fully supported by kickstand. I had to get a longer bolt and because of the washer spacers the stand can now rotate under pressure. Now not as secure as it was designed without the spacers. Hope it last."
4,good stand,Great center stand works very well .The rubber feet wont stay on even with glue. Bought to install on motorized bike to be able to start enginein a stationary position but that dosen't work.Still a good buy
3,not what cracked up to be & title is misleading,"I had read rave reviews of this book and had high expectations for it but it is simply not the kind of book I was hoping for. It mostly applies to tree stand hunting and although it has a good chapter on still hunting those who hunt in areas other than the western rainforest jungle part of the blacktails range are going to feel left out. It has a few chapters pertaining to judging trophies and preparing your animal for mounting which is great for those who are looking for that but I bought the book thinking to learn more about blacktail deer and also different hunting methods that work. It should be titled, trophy blacktail tree stand hunting, or some such thing. A nice book for what it is and those into that method will surely enjoy it but it is not what I thought I was buying."
2,Need better size information before purchase,"This exhause tip needs better information on the size of the incoming tailpipe. My tail pipe is 3"" and you would think this would fit but it didn't. The internal dimension of this tip is 2 1/2"" so the tip would actually constrict the flow of exhaust in my case, and it couldn't even be attached with the bolt on adapters. The product itself is excellent if the correct sizing information was supplied so you could make an intelligent buying decision."
2,Statler Brothers - a rare disappointment,It may have been my fault in that I didn't read that it was Statler Brothers with other people singing. I was going to gift it for someone that loves Statler's music. I ended up not doing so because I knew they would be disappointed. This was someone tossing a few songs on a disc just to make money.
3,Statlers Christmas DVD,"Not nearly as good as the previous ""An Evening with"" and ""Another Evening With the Statler Brothers"". A little too slow paced for me."
4,SPICE GIRLS LIVE IN ISTANBUL!,"This video is very good for any Spice fan who wants to know more about the girls. The video starts out with a 30 minute interview with the girls. It then goes to the good stuff! The Spice Girls first every concert! It was filmed in Istanbul, Turkey on October 12, 1997 infront of 8,000 fans and millions more through pay-per-view! The BIG flaw of this video is that they edited out half of the concert! Songs on the video are If You Cant Dance, Who Do You Think You Are?, Say You'll Be There, Step To Me, Naked, Two Become One, Spice Up Your Life, Move Over, and finishes with Wannabe. Songs that were edited are Something Kinda Funny, Saturday Night Divas, Stop, Too Much, Love Thing, and Mama. Why did they edit so many songs! A plus though is that Geri is still part of the gang during this concert!"
3,Not the entire concert... disappointed,"The video itself is great, but I would have liked to seen more of the concert. The best songs were missing."
5,Great video!,"I love the Spice Girls!I'm sad that Geri left, but I still love the Spice GIrls anywy! You should buy the new singele!(It's super-de-duper-great!)Girl Power Emma, Vicki, Melanie C, MelB, & Geri(even though you left, I still love you lots!)"
2,They destroyed a work of art.,This is not the whole concert. the deleted about 7 or 8 sings from the original concert. They even deleted 2 of my favorite songs. Mama and Too Much. It is a disgrace to the Spice Girls. Because I saw the concert live and it was better than the video.
4,Something's Missing!!,"I was a die hard Spice Girls fan, and when this concert aired on Pay-per-view, I taped it and seriously watched it everyday! Now, over the years, things get lost, misplaced, etc so I haven't seen that tape in a long time. Needless to say I was elated to find this on Amazon and couldn't wait to watch it! However, when it started, I was immediately disappointed because this is not the full concert! Off top, I can say the following performances are missing from this tape.Something Kinda FunnySaturday Night DivasStopToo MuchIt's not a bad concert at all, and I would still recommend it for any Spice fan. But geeeeez it drove me crazy to see those performances missing!"
4,"fun, but edited","this is a must have if you are a big of their debut album spice. only two songs from their second album appear. i had to wait for abcfamily to see the entire concert, and now i've missplaced that tape. if you are free for an hour and like the first album this is the tape for you."
5,VIVA LA SPICE,"Well,i think girl talk was really nice.The concert wasn't cool as wembly stadium concert."
4,A Great Video but Not the Best,"This video is very fun to watch I still watch it every once andwhile but however a lot of the good songs aren't in there such as,DENYING, DO IT, VIVA FOREVER,(my favorite which i would have like to see with Geri just for curiosity)SOMETHING KINDA FUNNY, LADY IS A VAMP, TOO MUCH, STOP, LOVE THING, NEVER GIVE UP ON THE GOOD TIMES. But I would still reccomend it to Spice fans. The rehersals are really cool to watch and the part where Scary Says ""I got my rice my peas and Chicken"" and she is dancing is FUNNY!!!!"
3,Istanbul conert,Good video but it was too short...should have gone on longer. I don't think its worth the money since its too short...but if it was longer then yes. SPORTY SPICE RULES!
2,The Ghost of Sesame Street DVDs Past,"I was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized. And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over.Imagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing ""All though the Year"" from _Elmo Saves Christmas"" among others). The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage.If you don't have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars. If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity. Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative."
1,No Creativity!!!,"I was so disappointed by this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! As all the other reviews have noted, it is just old material recycled. But the transition into this old material was also horrible. My two year old daughter even recognized that these were just the old movies rolled into one."
1,Visited by a Sesame Street Christmas Past,"SAVE YOUR MONEY...........IF YOU OWN ""CHRISTMAS EVE ON SESAME STREET"", ""ELMO SAVES CHRISTMAS"", AND ""HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM ELMOS WORLD"" THEN YOU DONT WANT THIS. i am in my 20's but i love the muppets, and when i saw this on here i was totally stoked at the chance to see a new chapter in the muppet vault only to pay $10 for a movie with 25% new movie and 75% clips from the movies listed above. if owning one with a little sample of all 3 hits is what you want then but this item, if not buy the 3 pack of all 3 previously listed movies @ target, Walmart or on here for a great price."
3,Oscar's Garbage Can Emptied On Christmas Eve!,"That's what this movie is like. Dump out some old Sesame Street footage! Dump out the animation! Dump out the scenes about Hanukkah and Kwanzaa! Dump out the frightened delivery boy! (What is this, the 'Hood?)There are, however, three things I like about this movie:1) They didn't include any Moslem celebration. (I guess the producers didn't deem the fasting of Ramadan or the self-mutilation of Ash-Shura festive enough.)2) Lots of Oscar the Grouch footage is included. (He's one of my favorite Sesame Street characters!)3) Santa Claus was well done, with great acting and an excellent, original wardrobe!I hope Sesame Street produces another ""Christmas Carol"" more true to Dickens' original novel, and to Sesame Street. Oscar would be ideal for the role of Scrooge. It would be nice to take a look into his past and gloomy future, too!"
5,develops critical thinking skills while having fun,This book is filled with all sorts of fun pencil&paper activities to help children develop their visual & critical thinking skills while having fun.
