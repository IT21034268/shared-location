5,Too many coincidences to dismiss,"The book presents some very interesting examples of a message that geographically separated ancient societies wanted to convey. My attempts to explain away the strange similarities seem empty and counter productive, much like sticking my head in the sand. I am following up this book with further exploration on the subject because it is important enough to research even if only a small percentage of his theories are correct."
2,Good while it lasted,"I guess I should not have expected too much for the price. It was good while it lasted. I have purchased cheap mikes, middle of the road and more expensive name brand models and I have yet to find one with staying power. Don't waste your money on this one; you will end up back where you started in less than 6 months."
3,HELP!!,"I had just bought this item, and I know it needs to be applied online... but how do I get it started and where do I go??"
2,"Nice pictures, that is about it.","If you just want to look at every single heating method available, then this book is for you. If you want some help repairing a problem, or adding ducting, this is not the book for you. All it has is many many pictures of various systems."
1,Heating and Air Conditioning,I try to know how to do this application to buy the book on shopping but something I don't understand if my card was right if anything happen I don't know if it safe to used my credit card and I hope you with send me the book if my card alright
5,Great for stadium use!,"We keep it on hand for football games, for the unexpected shower or downpour. Works great, and very comfortable to wear."
3,Decent Introduction and Summary of the Topic,"As with other books in this series I thought that this was a decent intro and summary to the topic. I enjoyed the color plates. However, I would have liked to have seen a MUCH more extensive Bibliobraphy so that you could continue your research into the topic. This series kind of leaves you at a dead end."
4,ein wenig besser als Teil 1,"Dieser Band ist etwas besser als der erste dieses Duos. Was ich in jenem geschrieben habe, trifft zwar auch hier wieder zu. Doch insgesamt ist dieses Heft stimmiger. Leider nicht vollkommen. Aber wo findet man schon so etwas?"
4,Strange movie- but you've got to see it!!,"This movie is a Russian fairy tale come to life. It's a fun movie, very entertaining! It's very odd. But after I saw it I knew I had to find it for my movie collection. It's one of my favorites!!"
4,Suspension of Reality,This film suspended reality for me - I was entranced - the stop-motion technique alone lends to the eery feeling little Otesanek brings to the screen. I began to understand this woman's obsession with having a child - and how she would covet this tree trunk... am I mad??? Fabulous recreation of a disturbing fairy tale.
4,Interesting and strange,"I'm making this short and sweet. I wanted to stop watching this movie all through it but just couldn't make myself watch for wanting to know what was going to happen next. Really odd and disturbingly amusing at the same time. I felt strange while watching it, kind of the same way I felt when watching movies like Eraserhead and any one of the Divine movies. If you like odd movies and don't mind subtitles then by all means watch this one."
5,Verbatim 94971 4.7 8X white,"The most reliable discs I have used with no malfunctions, skips or rejections as I had experienced with silver discs."
5,Finally a book by someone who STUDIED actual Trauma Victims!,It was so good to read something on this dreadful subject by someone who did acutual studies of Trauma victims instead of just dismissing the subject and saying there is now way for someone to forget and remember such horrible things. More and more research is showing that truama leaves physical scars on the brain and I hope that it is only a matter of time before there is an easy and proven way to test a person with recovered memories for this physical proof to back them up when searching for justice. Thank God for Lenore Terr and researchers like her who are looking for the Truth and NOT a way to prove their ideas at the expence of the truth!
4,Good Snips for Rag Quilting,"These snips are great for rag quilting. The snipping of all the seam allowances can be pretty tedious, but the spring on these snips help to save your hands. The only problem I've had with them is that the little clip that slides into the groove to lock the snips when not in use will fall down into the groove between snips. I solved this problem by putting a piece of scotch tape around the handle to keep that retainer clip out of the way. A small annoyance, but it certainly doesn't outweigh how well these work."
3,Heather,"I guess I can't give an accurate opinion on these, because I used them wrong. I tried making hard candy suckers out of these molds and they melted and got all distorted. So, I just wanted to review and let everyone know that these ONLY work for chocolate, not hard candy!"
5,Air Supply's Crowning Achievment!,"This is by the far Air Supply's finest album. I was introduced to Air Supply by the song ""Goodbye"". I immediately went to purchase the album and have been a fan since. It was then that I was introduced to the ""80's Air Supply"". The album begins with ""It's Never To Late"" and closes beatifully will ""Thinking About You"" and packed in the middle with some awesome tunes such as the title track and the their best song ever...""Goodbye"" Absolutley an album to have for any music lover!!"
5,Nicely Detailed,"This album is detailed for the headphones. The intro, lead guitars, piano and ethereal vocals of ""It's Never Too Late"" are reminiscent of tonic Air Supply sound. ""Faith"" is great - not unlike an integrated gospel choir in Beverly Hills. My favorite, ""Goodbye"", was written by David Foster and Linda Thompson. Production is rich and detailed, signature of Humberto Gatica. (If you use headphones, try to get a pair with frequency response of at least 8-25,000 Hz, with sensitivity rated at 98 dB or higher. Real brain ticklers.)"
2,no one has ever read the bible,"Jesus""If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters--yes, even their own life--such a person cannot be my disciple.Luke 14:26"
3,Some Good - Some Questionable - Some Not So Good,"My main issues with this movie are:(1.) Thinking in categories is an inherent characteristic of human thought and we are aware of the pitfalls, yet the movie still succumbed to categorical framing in it's questions and answers without controlling for the biasing effect.(2.) The premise that a particular God is the creator of the ""goodness"" in humans without examining other explanations.(3.) Little recognition of other religions, let's say, Native American beliefs which may be more exemplary, arguably, to some idealized relationship of humans with all of life on Earth, if not the health of the planet as a whole.The most interesting segment was the game show style, with separate conservative and liberal teams, discussion of controversial issues presented as independent questions devoid of interfering tags such as conservative or liberal which would have biased their responses. I would have liked to have seen more of that type of interaction."
1,Lord Save Us From Your Followers ... with a decidedly Christian slant,"Great title ... one that really dupes the viewer into thinking this might be a unbiased, non-religious documentary. The host is clearly biased toward his Christianity, and his ridicule of non-believers is prevalent in just about every opinion and comment he makes. This documentary is pro-evangelical Christianity masquerading as a secular documentary. I recommend you pass this one up."
5,An Unbelievably Thought Provoking And Just As Inspiring Film,Simply put; I am a Christian because Jesus Christ loved me enough to die for me. This movie may forever change how I go about living my life as a Christian.
4,Pretty good movie.,"I enjoyed this documentary, as a Christian. There were a few things that I feel didn't portray Christians truly (like the gameshow. We aren't all ignorant of non Christian culture! We weren't always Christians, ya know...). It made me laugh a few times, and even tear up somewhere close to the end. I think it's good for Christians to see, so that they don't make the same mistakes that some are making, giving Christ a bad name when in fact He is the answer to every problem known to man. I would recommend it, and I'm pretty sure anyone would enjoy this movie, not just people who love Jesus."
5,Country Rock rollercoaster that never gets old.,"This is the best country rock recording I've ever heard.The first Carlene Carter album I ever owned was Musical Shapes. I thought nothing could be better than that in the world of country rock. I went and bought up most all her other recordings to see if she ever did anything else like that great ""country punk"" album from the 80's. This was the gold nugget of the lot (although all her stuff is enjoyable to me).Some recordings sound like projects that the musicians work hard at and are glad when they're over, and some recordings sound like everyone is having fun. This is the latter.If you are a Carlene Carter fan at all and you don't own this album, you should. If you own this and don't own Musical Shapes, then by all means get that one too. And, if you've heard of Carlene Carter and you're wondering which one of her discs to buy first, this is it!"
4,10hp Muffler - Tecumseh,The muffler installs relatively easily once you get the proper screw driver to install the muffler to the engine. There is very little room on the left-hand screw where it attaches to the engine - a special driver it necessary but costs like $3 at a hardware store.Once fired up the muffler works okay - not as quiet as I expected but it is an improvement over the generic muffler that comes with the engine (on my generator in this instance). Wish I had a noise meter to quantify the noise reduction.
3,"Good, but BCO-2 is in some ways better.","MCO is basically a collection of the openings from many thousands of master chess games, with evaluations, all well presented. This is a very useful thing for club-level chess players to have.The main competition in book form is from Batsford_Chess_Openings 2nd edition. BCO-2 is newer and more up-to-date, better organised, and has less errors in most openings. MCO-13 is not bad in these areas, but BCO-2 is better.On the other hand, MCO-13 has better written chapter introductions and includes a few complete games for most openings. This is useful for players as it shows what types of middle- and end-games they are likely to get into.Both books now face tough competition from computer software."
5,This is the classic opening reference for Good Reason!,"This is the definative opening book, unless you want an encylopedic set for a lot more money! The book is very systematic and gives good background information. I don't think it will be outdated anytime in the next few decades... The MCO is a necessary reference for anyone studing from any chess book, as well as being highly instructive on its own merits. This should be one of the first books a player ever buys!"
5,"Extremely easy to use, absolutely necessary, a gold key!","The MCO is a handy one volume reference which covers is both exhaustive, and novice-friendly.Nobody can study chess with an opening book, and this is the one to have! Openings are organized by moves, discussed historically and philosophically, and are easily compared!"
3,Good Book,"The book arrived prior to expected date and in perfect condition. The styles are probably not what I would have my daughter wear all the time, but the instructions can easily be tweaked to make them more modern. The instructions are easy to follow and the patterns are easy to use."
3,Needs to have clearer instructions,"I bought this after viewing all the positive reviews. This book does contain information for just about every article of clothing a toddler would need, as well as ways to deviate from the standard pattern. Patterns for 4 different sizes are included. I feel that I am mid-level when it comes to sewing, have sewn with commercial patterns, basic instructions off the internet, and basic items without a pattern. Having said that, some of the instructions are missing, or assume that you know a lot more about sewing. There are some good ideas in here, but if you want to sew just one or two of the items, I'd recommend buying a specific pattern."
5,staying mom,Our local public school uses this book for gifted children. My 4th grade girl is not in that program. But she loves this book. She basically reads it herself and enjoys solving the problems. A very good book to sharpen kids thinking skill. I think this is the best I have so far.
5,Adding the music to math...,"This is a fantastic tool for getting primary kids excited about math. My ""mathletes"" love the characters and fun problems."
2,"No brain teaser, only regular school math.",The exercises mainly try to make regular elementary school math fun. I want a math brain teaser for 1st/2nd grader. This book doesn't do it.
2,Ripping you off,"This is book is what in marketing they call the rip-off strategy.Chances are you're not going to pay this outrageous price for such a boring book unless you are forced to for a class, as was my case. It's bad enough that the publisher has jacked up the price into the stratosphere, but to rub it in with black and white pictures is just wrong. Shame on McGraw Hill. Shame on the author. Shame on everyone involved in the selling of this book, including Amazon.Then there's the content of the book. And even by marketing standards (this is my 4th marketing class) it's outrageously bland and dull."
5,"Book order to Toronto, Canada","The book was in excelent condition, I would recommend for future buyers to invest extra bucks on the shipment to get a faster delivery."
5,A complete delight!,"Claire Cook has written a laugh-out-loud novel about the way we live now. She casts a flinty eye on marriage, motherhood, suburban back yards. This is a big-hearted, beautifully written romp that will have readers nodding and laughing in recognition. Give yourself a treat and buy this book!"
1,Embarressed for Her,"The charachter Beth writes numerous and lengthy emails to her traveling neighbor and makes comments about his infrequent responses. Did anyone else feel that Beth was delusional? From her comments on the things he did say, I got the feeling that he was not that into her. I was embarrassed for the character. I did not like this book."
1,Disappointing...,"I like Claire Cooke, but I was very disappointed in this one. It's like she couldn't think of what to write for a next book and decided just to do a one sided email conveersation and, apparently, that's a novel? That's it....a one sided email conversation throughout. I didn't realize that's what it would be when I bought this book...I mean...a few pages of an email conversation....between two people...ok....but a one sided email conversation for the whole book? Very disappointing. I couldn't even finish it."
1,Ready to Barf!,"I decided to read this novel because I live on the South Shore of Mass. I figured ""why not support a local writer"" (actually someone gave me the book - she was going to use it as kindling). . I couldn't have been more disappointed. This book is poorly written, amateurish - no substance whatever. I guess I'm just not a beach reader. I don't like trite storylines in books or movies. If you want to read a REALLY good novel, try WATER FOR ELEPHANTS - they need to make a movie out of that one! . . . Claire's books are pure drivel and certainly not ""movie-worthy."" How did she find a publisher?"
1,Wish there was a -0- rating.,"This is one of the most insipid books in the universe.The characters have no redeeming qualities, unless you count vanity and whining.It's amazing to me to see how many good reviews have been posted.This is not quality fiction and it's a pity people like this find publishers.I was not at all sympathetic to the main character...yes, life in the suburbs might be boring and the man you married years ago might not be as attentive as he once was...but that's life. Deal with it!Don't be looking over the fence...there's too much at stake to play with fire like that!"
1,My spare time is worth more than this!,"I just spent the last hour trying to figure out HOW airheads like this get published and serious authors flounder?This bit of fluff about a neighbor and her secret fantasy via the internet is the most vacant piece of junk I've read in a while.Before I was finished, I wanted to smack 'SwimSlave' Beth and whack her silly neighbor 'Wanderlust' Thomas....they were both too over the top for my tastes.The jacket of the book says it was written while the author was waiting for her daughter to finish swim class...early in the morning...maybe she should have had coffee first.I WON'T be reading any more of the precious Claire Cook.What a waste of my valuable spare time!"
4,Funny and Enjoyable,"I read this author's book, 'Must Love Dogs' and was totally charmed by it, to my surprise, I had not expected to even like it! (Based only on reviews of the film, see what a mistake that was!)I enjoyed this book, too, but in a different way. It touched a bit close to home. I have an Aunt-in-law who basically ignored everyone in her life but her on-line computer chat room 'friends', not a pretty sight!But, the story kept me reading, and I was able to laugh at the funny parts of this book, and feel sorry for the main character.Books with a 'message' like this one, cautionary tales, are never ones we embrace, are they, necessarily? But, neither does that mean they are any less worthwhile than the stories we do cherish.I think it is a book that is worth a read!"
1,"Absolutely silly and stupid, not to mention boring!","The title of my review says it all. Wasted time reading it, not going to waste any more time reviewing it. And please, don't waste your money."
4,Dea incessu patuit,"""Dea incessu patuit: 'And she revealed herself to be a goddess' (Virgil), as Venus did before Aeneas. And so, we are challenged to find our own goddess within, the part that makes you uniquely YOU."" The life of Beth has become the Life of the Unfulfilled and Underappreciated, as she raises her 3 children into adolescence and struggles to find something to say to her spouse of many years. And then ... she plunges into the cyber world through e-mails to her traveling neighbor. Will she thrive and survive with this new allegance, or is she coming to learn more important things about herself? Through one sided e-mails, we go along on her Special Delivery discovery tour. It isn't necessarily Great Fiction, but it is fun and it is honest and written with plenty of wit. - The Goddess Mamalinda"
4,I couldn't put it down,"I picked up ""Ready to Fall"" because I was intrigued at the thought of a book written strictly in the form of emails. It was a nice glimpse into the life of Beth Riordan, but what I felt was missing was the other end of the conversation with her neighbor Thomas. It left too many gaps for me. However, you can still follow the conversation quite well and see the transformation of their relationship. it was much like reading someone's private diary."
1,Unreadable.,"Hans Habe, Off Limits (Crest, 1957)A review on the front cover of this turkey calls it ""the finest novel yet released about the American occupation."" If that's the case, people were writing some serious drivel after World War II. There's not a single word anywhere in this book that conveys anything other than Habe's utter boredom with his subject. Two-dimensional characters, both American and German, move through occupied Berlin just after the war, trying desperately to give their lives meaning. They fail just as much as Habe does in trying desperately to give the reader any interest.Thankfully, Gunter Grass came along to write much better stuff about occupied Berlin a couple of years later, and this faded into well-deserved obscurity. Best to let it lie in its shallow grave. (zero)"
3,"Great design, but god-aweful durability","When I first found this, I was very interested, considering the Zeta Gundam is my favorite Gundam. Right out of the box, a majority of the pieces I had were bent in some way, and it was an ABSOLUTE PAIN to attatch the wings to the figure, unfortunately. It's also hard to take the hands on and off, but I think that's standard for these kind of figures. To make things slightly worse, it took me longer, for me, to transform it than the MG Zeta, and it wasn't the directions. After a feww days, the joints started to get extremely loose, much like what happened to my PG Wing Zero [:-(]. If you were to go for a good Fix Figuration, this probably isn't the best choise."
1,Worthless,"I agree with the other posting. I was hoping to leverage all SBA features as well as vaildate I was using the product correctly. This book was so incredibly basic it ceased to be of any value whatsoever. I am sending it back for a refund. Don't waste your money. Wait for a more advanced guide writen by a CPA or at least someone who understands business or accounting, not a part-time freelancer."
2,Didn't Finish,"I'm only on page 76 and I'm bored. I thought this book was going to be full of stories from college students but I'm seeing essay from parent after parent after parent (even though the one about hugging was very cute!) I'm disappointed and I'm glad I didn't pay much for it, because I'm selling it right now."
2,Not like the Soup I know,"I've read several of the Chicken Soup books before, and this one fell completely flat. There were few stories, and most of them were by a select group of the same authors, which also happened to be the people who put the book together. In previous books, I've found more stories from a number of submitters. This format seemed more comforting and provided a better book instead of just a bunch of inspirational jib jab by people who get paid to do it. The previous books had stories from the heart, that affected me in one way or another, and the College edition fell flat as to describing the real college experience and the soup that one needs."
4,It relates to me,"Chicken Soup for the College Soul: Inspiring and Humorous Stories about College was a great book. It had many stories that related to me, and they were not stories that would only happen to certain people but they could happen to anyone. It really inspired me and influenced me to be more outgoing."
4,Chicken Soup Is Good for You,"Chicken Soup continues to publish sappy stories, but they touch you none-the-less and are always there for a good cry! More importantly, the stories let you know that someone else has had the same or a similar experience. You're not alone."
5,Powerful,"Like all of the other series, this one was fabulous. College students, especially need some Chicken Soup. If you like this book, you'll love Major in Success, by Patrick Combs. I teach at a University and this book changes lives."
1,Chicken Soup?,"Chicken Soup is not for the soul. It's for people who are sick and can not digest anything of greater substance. It is thin, watery, and its few free-floating chunks of meat have been long-since sapped of all their juices and most of their nutritional value.In this sense, I think this, and the rest of this series of books -- are very aptly titled (""Watery Medicinal Broth for the Soul"" might have been even better, though.) Stories for the consummate, naive, irrationally sentimental, all-American moron. It only takes a glance at the cover to realize that you're going to have your intelligence and aesthetic sensibilities insulted; but actually reading through a few of these dime-a-dozen parables really drives that insult home.Ditch the Chicken Soup and get yourself a nice, juicy Steak instead."
2,outer space wall hanging,Not a quality item and edges were frayed. Sent it back; refunded product cost but cost had to pay shipping twice.
4,Enough phrases but pronunciation help not there,"I had a hard time as a beginner to Danish because there is no pronunciation help given with the phrases and words, only a pronunciation guide at the beginning of the book."
2,Not really useful as phasebook OR dictionary,"I purchased this because it was the only Danish dictionary at my local bookseller's. Unfortunately, I have to say after a few months of having used it that it's not terribly effective in either function. The phrases are not cross-referenced in the table of contents for easy access, requiring one to page through most of the back-half trying to think of what sections might be relevant (example: try finding ""please"" and ""thank you."") Several of the perfectly mundane words I wanted to look up (""beads,"" ""bacon"") weren't in the dictionary.Previous reviews have mentioned the lack of pronunciation guidelines within the dictionary itself, and I too found using the 'systematic pronunciation system' far more difficult than simply trying to parrot a native speaker. Buy a Berlitz traveller's phrasebook, then cross your fingers that someday Bantam will publish a Danish dictionary."
1,worthless,"I speak a very small amount of danish as my mother's family is from there.Since it had been 30 years since I had been to Denmark , I thought a danish dictionary would come in handy.Don't waste your money on this book.The translations are spelled in danish of course , but there is no english pronunciation right next to the word.The beginning of the book has the danish alphabet and language rules , but if you knew how to read the language and how the rules apply , you'd already be speking danish !Worthless !!"
1,For beginners,Im very disapointed. I needed a really dictionary - and I got a dictionaryfor beginners or for readers of children-books.Its not fair that Amazon don't write thatAnd as I am only supported by Amazon in my Kindle - please get a gooddictionary!! In fact I need it - when I use my Kindle outside my home :)regardsLeif O. Dahl
5,Awesome!,"Loved it! Both 5.5 & 7.5 daughters had fun being creative with this kit! Even my 2.5 worked on one. I bought another kit since in couple of hours they went through most of the shapes, cutouts--they did this with two other friends similar ages--friends loved it too!"
5,Creative and fun!,"Encourages a child to MAKE THEIR OWN CARDS, and get involved with arts. I prefer to have children learn to be creative and make things instead of buying everything."
4,Make your own cards..,This is a cute set easy for kids to make cards totally independently. Easy to follow pictures or they cam create their own ideas. My daughter lived this and now I use it as gifts for girls ages 5-9
3,OK,"Our niece was not overly enthralled with this gift...I do not think it was anything against the product itself, but rather a poor choice on our part in choosing this particular product...good activity kit for the right kid (with parental assistance)."
4,Card Kit,What a nice collection of all the things a new artist would need to create her own cards for people. I especially liked the number of cards that could be made too. Other kits were smaller for the money! Nice opportunity for the young artist to send a card and be artistic about it! Nothing says it better than homemade.
1,Bad Album,"I like most of Hammers stuff, but in Funky Headhunter he is really a big disapointment. IMO, Hammer is trying to sound like Gansta rap w/o the explicits and he is not that convincing. The album also lacks the appeal of his other four. There are a couple (and I mean just a couple) hits in here, but as a whole this is one of the worst albums I have bought! Oh well, at least Hammer improved on his next album (Inside Out)..."
4,"Overall, the best Hammer album","With his previous albums, Hammer relied on huge hits to sell his albums. This time around, he he didn't score any huge hits, but the result isn't that bad. Hammer's technique has definitely improved, and the beats are funkier. ""Pumps and a Bump"" is the obvious winner here, even though it's way too long. A lot of good tracks, though, with ""Don't Stop"" and ""It's All Good."" The album falls off a little bit in the second half, but overall, it's a pretty good effort. It's a shame it didn't sell well, probably because America was so enthralled with the stuff Dre and Snoop were throwing out (although those were their best days). If you're a fan of Hammer or even semi-hard rap, it's definitely worth a shot."
4,Great for test prep.,"This book was invaluable for the AAPA Pathologist's Assistance Fellowship Exam. Not only does it give numerous Robbin's based questions for practice, it also helps focus on imoportant areas, giving extended answers with explanations and page #s for review."
3,There are better books out there on this subject,"I bought this book at Home Depot for $14.95 because I was there and that was all they had. It is cheaper here on Amazon, first off.But second, I am kind of disappointed. It is such a ""surface"" type of book. It looks good on the exterior but really lacks any type of meat.We really want to put in a wet bar and an exercise area in our soon to be done basement and there really was only like a paragraph on each subject. I think it tries to tackle too many subjects and leaves no time to go into any of the subjects.This book would look good in a doctor's office where you only have 10 minutes to peruse through what is there. That is about all it will accomplish.The best thing about the book is definitely the floor plan symbols and the grid. So it isn't a complete waste of money. But don't expect for this book to go too in-depth on anything at all."
5,Characters delightful. A real page-turner. Wonderful.,"I found this love story to be completely charming. The characters are fresh, and the tenors remind me of three famous tenors singing today. I learned basic principles about the voice, and warmed to the story immediately. Recommended highly."
4,Some cons but really cool.,"First the cons: Full doesn't make the picture bigger just blackens around the image and keeps the size of the screen the same. Also on my computer it wouldn't let my modem work. The on-line help that I printed days before said tocheck with the ISP but I knew before hand they couldn't help me. What I ended up doing was unplugging the card and changin my modem's IRQ setting. That then enabled the card to be used. So I think that you will have to take a look at the IRQs and play with them (which windows says you shouldn't, but that is the easiest thing to do).But overall this is a really good card. Some of my channels come in blurry but that is due to my cable line, not the card. The remote control makes it conveninet to sit back in my chair and prop up my legs to watch tv. When I move I'm going to have the computer in another room so it will be nice to watch TV and play on the computer at the same time.Due to the Installation problems I give it 4 Stars."
4,tv on your pc,its handy to have tv on your desktop. If you hate bookwork as much as I do it really helps. Do'nt expect hd quality picture but it works fine.
1,Waste of Money,"If retailers need to know the information contained in this article, they probably won't stay in business long. I should have assumed it wouldn't hold much value just by looking at the title ""high energy market"". I'm sure the author meant expensive energy, not that the marketplace is high energy.The article suggests tried and true retailing tactics such as upselling, add- ons, improved signage, etc. There is nothing here about marketing weatherization services, which is what I was looking for."
1,"good insight, not much to execute on","Well Hagel has managed to as least salvage some of the venture money that was pumped into 12 Entrepreneuring. So THIS is what he was working on for the 2 years he was there. A solid documentation of all of the work that he and the employees did. And he is smart to be making some $ from the whole thing. My sense is that Hagel is selling his reputation with this book, and not much content, and certainly less actionable content. I don't think John Seely Brown wrote anything other than the preface.The good news is that there are several clear ""bullet point"" type of take-aways... but nothing that isn't obvious.In summary, Hagel is a classic consultant: very good at talking about what to do and deducing ""notions"" --- but there is a definite business execution component missing. I'd pass on the book."
2,Not Yet,"This book is definitely well written, but web services went the way of the Internet Bubble. Both John Hagel and John Seely Brown tried unsuccessfully to make a commercial splash in the web services world at their previous venture 12 Entrepreneuring. Great book on a topic that has come and gone. Question the sources - if they really believe what they've written then why couldn't they make it work?"
5,Awesome book...,"I finished ""Nature Lessons"" over the weekend. It was an awesome, powerful book. I thought it really captured the complex, love-hate relationship with a family member whose behavior is totally unpredictable. It also gave a touching look at the scar that apartheid left behind. If you know anyone who is looking for a good read, say, ""Lynette Brasfield, Nature Lessons."""
2,Not recommended,"This version of Philip falls into so many shallow traps repeating the errors and outright lies of Philip's enemies, it is frustrating to read. He makes blanket statements which are just ""let me tell you what to think about this"" without backing them up.Having read at least five other bios of Philip, my estimate of this one is that it no where near does justice to the man, his spirit, character or reasons for his decisions.Walsh's is the most interesting and best researched, even forgetting that it was written long ago. He has the most love for his subject. He really shows Philip's heroic character and immense pressures, along with flaws.Kamen's is an interesting read, though it almost ignores the Catholic aspect of Philip."
5,Best price found!,I hope any of you aspiring to add to your Holiday Gold collection take advantage of the sale AMZN is currently having this month. It is first quality and lovely! Each year I add as many pieces as possible (my Dad sends me money for Christmas). Lenox also has a nice sale this time of year too with several pieces discounted from this collection. Happy holidays!
1,You get what you pay for.,This item is very cheap. The material is extremely thin. The cut is also weird and I found them very uncomfortable. I ended up throwing them all out after about a month. I would recommend paying a little more and getting a better product than this one.
1,Problems with loading WinDVD 8 Platinum,When I tried to load WinDVD 8 I received 18 error messages about not being able to load some .dll's. After it finshed loading I tried to run the program and it gave me an error message that it was unable to run the program. I tried to load this copy of WinDVD 8 on three different computers and all gave the same error messages. I downloaded a trial version from InterVido's web site and it loaded and ran OK. I contacted InterVideo about the problem and their service rep said it was a problem in the installer program that was on the CD. The InterVido service rep. said they had corrected the problem in the WinDVD 8 program that you can download from thier web site. This is a problem with InterVideo's WinDVD 8 CD and not with Amazon.com.James Ellett
1,Don't buy anything from Corel,"I own WinDVD 6 Platinum. I bought it directly from Intervideo, before they were bought by Corel. I paid for the disc. Spent over $ 100. Worked just fine. My computer crashed, I reinstalled the program and I need a new activation key. I have spent one month trying to extract the key from Corel. No help. No tech support. Their e-mail address does not work. They want me to buy a new product. But I won't."
1,Beware -- Dont Waste Your Money,"Besides being terribly buggy, this programs is impossible to reinstall, as many of us are doing on new Windows Vista computers. Like many of its ilk, Corel (which brought us the infamous Ulead Video Mess), makes it nearly impossible to get a renewed ""activation"" code. I've searched all over their site, but obviously they want you to buy the product again (and again).Instead, go for free dvd player software available on-line, or if you need basic editing software, go with a reputable seller. AVS for example has an inexpensive package of tools -- and a free player if thats all you need.And that really is all 98% of home users need.Why waste your time and money ?"
1,no support no support no support,"Geez, i can't believe that the online demo version of this stuff worked so well and the boxed store version would not even load. Don't waste your time trying to contact these buzzards either. After 45 minutes on hold I couldn't take it any longer. This stuff is a joke. There's got to be something better out there. My windows vista runs windows media player just fine. I don't even know why I bothered to spend hard earned cash on Intervideo. Save your money to buy a pizza, at least you'll be happy in the end."
2,Poor Tech Support,I had a simple question about making clips from videos and why I was not getting sound. Do they even have sound? Its four weeks plus and I still have not recieved an answer.
1,Defective software,The WinDVD 8 software came with a serial installation number that could not be used because one of the characters (a circle with a slash mark across it) is not on the keyboard. I sent an e-mail to WinDVD 8 and they never answeredme. Amazon refunded me for the full purchase price. Amazon deserves an A+!
1,Don't even think about it.,"I have purchased WinDVD 8 to upgrade Win DVD 7: what a mistake!I have made another mistake purchasing Win DVD Create 3 at the same time.Win DVD 8 won't start at all whilst Win DVD Create 3 always locks up during encoding! Bear in mind that I have a very clean and proven PC configuration and that I have this kind of issues only with these two programs. I have tried for hour to solve the problems, uninstalling, cleaning the register and reinstalling these applications, the video drivers and so on but it was only a big waste of time. I have contacted Intervideo's customer support the very next day after the purchase, asking for a refund, but I have got only promises for two months. In the end I have wasted money and time. I am very disappointed and surely I will never purchase anything from this company anymore in the future."
1,Not working and never worked,I bought this download and it never worked. What is worse is that I could not get any help from Coral either. I even wrote to their head office in Canada and my letter was ignored. These people have taken my money and produced nothing and I am extremely angry about it. What makes matters worse is that I cannot seem to get it off my computer even though it doesn't work!!
1,Terrible,"Great controls, layout etc. Crash, crash, crash. It constantly locks ALL of my computers up all 14 of them. Don't use this product even if you get it free."
1,Too Much for the Average Reader,"I read this book, not knowing that Robert Whitlow was a christian author. I read the back and it seemed interesting(how I choose most of my books). I was overwhelmed, and not in a good way. The born-again christianity hidden within what would have been a decent story, turned me off. It made me doubt my very existence, and I think that should have been mentioned somewhere on the dust jacket. Don't misunderstand me, I was raised Catholic, and am not anti-religion, or anti-christian in any way, but the feelings that the characters described as hearing God were unrealistic, and for those of us who apparently lack this ""calling"" it made me feel like I was worthless, and frankly had a very negative reaction to the book with a severe emotional breakdown. Please don't try to ""save"" me. I just wanted to give a warning to anyone considering purchasing this book."
1,No where near Grisham,"I finally put this book down after reading about half of it. I love intriguing mystery stories, courtroom drama, & adventure stories. The cover of this book looked promising. Boy was I wrong. I simply got tired of the christian preaching that was going on. I don't know what happened at the end of the book, and frankly don't think I could have stomached the relentless preaching to find out. The story line was very good, and had the author kept going without introducing his religious beliefs mid stream, he would have had another fan. Sadly disappointed."
3,interesting plot,"It was refreshing to read a book with an original and attention-grabbing plot. Unfortunately, I had no idea this book was ""religious"" fiction until I began reading the book. I felt somewhat tricked. The author should disclose this somewhere on the cover. I almost put the book down several times, but because I had become so fascinated by the intriguing plot and couldn't wait to see how it turned out, I simply ignored the religious preachings and enjoyed the remaining parts of the book. I will not buy another religious fiction book."
3,a good beginning..,with a great story concept which lost momentum soon thereafter. most of the book is concentrated on the 2 main characters love story and ones search for salvation before the pace picks up again slightly towards the end. have to admit i was a bit disappointed
2,Christian fiction,"I got this book out of the library for my e-reader. I wish there was something in the description of the book about the Christian aspects of it. I really wanted to know what happened with the list, but I couldn't get past all the religion. If I'd known it was a Christian book, I would never have gotten it from the library. I'm just glad that I didn't pay for it."
4,A good book.,This is another great book byRobert Whitlow. It is well laid out with a real life feel.
2,Objection!,"The story idea is interesting and captures you immediately, but like many of the reviewers have said, Whitlow uses most of the book to try to tell you his denominational views. I almost expected Renny to start speaking in tongues. There's also a few stupid things in here (like someone who should be smart, as he is a lawyer, trying to break into a mansion, only to have a security system go off...wow, who would have thought that a mansion would have a security system). There are some interesting characters in here but instead of developing them, he uses his time focusing on a prayer room and discussing topics that I as a Christian don't agree with. In conclusion, here are some books to read: The O'Malley series by Dee Henderson, ""The Ishbane Conspiracy"" by Randy Alcorn, & ""Out Of The Shadows"" by Sigmund Brouwer."
5,"Suspensful, believable",Master of english. So very enjoyable. Could not put the book down. One of those books that I read in 12 hours. Will always recommend it. Planning to take book to my best friend and tell her to take a day and get lost in this book.
5,Can't put it down,I have read half the book and had it 3 days with only a couple of hours each night to read. I can hardly put it down. Each sentence makes you want to read the next. I can hardly wait to finish it!
5,Fascinating Book,"This is the first book I read by Robert Whitlow, whom I never even heard of before, but it certainly inspired me to seek out and read more of his intriguing mystery stories. Whitlow has a flair for details and The List is a high quality Christian suspense novel that I would highly recommend."
5,A Fantastic Book!,"I took this book on vacation with me, and read it practically non-stop! I enjoy John Grisham's legal thrillers, but Whitlow's books are laced with ""hope,"" something that you don't find often in the themes of Grisham's novels. If you are looking for an equally interesting read with a solidly Christian theme (keeping to a ""law"" theme) - you will really enjoy this book! This is one of my favorite Whitlow books, and I have read many!"
3,DC Literary Society,"This book, chosen by our book club was not a favorite of mine. I felt that the ending was shallow. I could not agree with the author's point of view."
2,not really a good deal,you are honestly better off getting the toxie triple terror box sets out there and get the other movies that were packaged with it too. the movies are not all bad. i have personally owned the box sets mentioned and the unincluded movies are good too. i suggest getting the other box sets other than this for not only price but also other good troma movie releases.my 2 stars are not for the movies themselves but this pack itself as a bum deal.
1,Mercy Me,I have to say that this for me was not a good buy. It deals with the making of a hit song. I just felt it could have been put together with the Cd or with another Dvd release.Cheers Richard Glenn
4,Quite a challenge,"This was one of the most challenging books on the Christian faith that I've ever read. Dunn explores the charactaristics of the early church to explore what the prevailing theology of the time period was. His findings are at times shocking with the diversity of lines of thought and the quite shattered church that he discovers.This book's writing style is quite boring and the amount of footnotes is distracting at times. Unless you love the subject it has a high chance of lull you to sleep quite quickly. Its implications however, are both challenging and compelling."
1,Very disappointed,"I dont mean to be so negative but I'm a business person and I dont have the time or energy to send this back and im annoyed. I was looking for some good educational information and this was a joke. This is an outdated video of three guys catching fish and complementing each other. No tackle discussions, no bait discussion. I am frankly floored this is even being sold. A guide to saltwater fishing should take you through tackle, bait, techiniques, locations, tips. I have 5 other videos of the series and I hope they are produced with education in mind."
5,The Book of Life,"I have read this Book cover to cover six times and I am almost finished with the seventh. Every time I read it, I discover better and better treasures hidden in it. Whether in the form of historical narratives or poetry, it is filled with timeless truth about God and man. If you will read one book cover to cover all your life, please let it be this one!"
2,Poorly written!,"You read a certain verse, and then when you like at the NRSV, you've see that they've used some sort of lackluster term.They've tried to translate it to please people who trash the Bible because they don't know anything about Biblical matters.It's not totally bad, the structure is similar to well-received Bibles like the NRSV, but it's just a rough translation of the Bible... Almost paraphrase in some instances!"
2,Revelations,"Almost all of the book of Revelations came from someone who had major hallucinations or someone who wanted to mess up what Jesus really meant. I prefer the Old Testmanent and the Gospels rather than what the apostle Peter has to say and the Book of Revelations (at least they make more sense). I don't even read the Bible anymore because I believe much of it is misinterpreted by the authors and they were not really ""divinely inspired"" from God. Basically another boring Amazon book and very expensive."
1,The New International PerVersion,Throw this bible corrupted by Satan in the trash and get yourself the only Holy Bible available: The King James Bible. What are you talking about might you ask? Does you Bible have Acts 8:37? Go ahead and look. I didn't think so. (...)
1,Rather Incredulous,"I hate to say it, but I was rather disappointed with the storyline of this book.The transitions are awkward and the story, while fantastic, was not enjoyable. I usually like science fiction, but this one had too much old English and not enough scantily clad martians.A lot of hype has been coming out about this book,and has even stemmed many a debate in Washington, D.C. I understand that politicians tend to enjoy this book, but I am brave enough to stand up and state that this book is not that great. The action scenes were not very eventful - more graphic details should have been used, and the lack of adjectives was a prominent flaw. The Bible had ridiculously high standards for its readers.Also, the author should know better than to use the second person - only amatures make such a mistake.All in all, this book was poorly written and not well researched.Don't read it."
3,Good but outdated and could use more analysis,"Getting some books on opening traps is perhaps one of the best moves any serious chess player should take. I like that there are a lot of traps, but the drawback is this book is older than the hills so considering getting a more up to date book on opening traps in addition is what I would suggest.The traps in this book are arranged by type of opening. This makes zooming in to the traps in the openings you play easy with the drawback as mentioned, it may not have the modern variation you use. The tactics in these openings will be helpful for everyone though. Most people should improve their tactics anyway.If I was writing this book I could also improve it by doing more analysis on the moves before the trap itself. Notes are sparse leaving you wondering what should have been played instead of the move given a question mark."
3,LEARNING OPENING TACTICS is great - this book does have some drawbacks,"There is probably nothing more effective to get results in practical play than to know the traps and tactics you will find in the openings you use. Therefore, the idea behind this book is excellent.It covers 300 different opening traps in many openings. No problem them there. The problems are as follows,a. it is in english descriptive notation.b. it provides very little analysis and in many cases ignors telling you the reasons and improvements when there is a ? or a ?? given.c. There are mistakes in the analysis.This book will still be useful in helping you improve your knowledge of opening traps but which I feel is important, but this is not even close to being the best opening traps book."
4,German romantic psychology laid bare,"only downside is noisy dvd video. The acting is beautiful and poignant, and so are the actors.The story is about youth who despair of any life that cannot perfectly fulfill desire. They play with a pistol as they party. Complications include absent parents, and an unhealthy closeness between a brother and sister. They are not quite incestuous; they share a male lover for whom they compete. The sister wants many male partners; she refuses to be any man's possession. At the same time, she thinks nothing of sleeping with the man her brother loves and wishes to possess. The result is very German."
4,Enjoyable Toy,This toy has been very fun for my 11 month old. He loves the animals and the sounds they make. It also educates with all the clever fun facts. This is a very enjoyable toy!
5,Very Entertaining,I bought this after watching how much fun my daughter had playing with one owned by family friends. It keeps her entertained which is great when I am trying to get things done in the kitchen. It plays music and tells the animal names and colors. It is also great for matching.
5,Wish it wasn't out of production!,"We got this magnetic farm as a birthday gift for my one-year-old daughter. She is now 3 1/2 and still loves it - as does her brother (age 17 months). It is just perfect. I have videos of both kids dancing to the little songs it plays. At age 1, the kids just like carrying around the magnetic pieces. Then they learn that the pieces fit into the toy, and later they learn about matching. It's just wonderful. I wanted to buy one for a cousin who was just born, until I saw that it's gone out of production and Amazon has tripled the price! Really? Nearly $50? It's really too bad. This will become one of those ""antique"" toys, like the ones Fisher Price has put back in production after all these years."
4,Great toy with room for improvement,"This is a great toy and the kids love it. What's not to love with fridge magnets? The thing is, wrong body parts match to make silly creatures. Perhaps no noise should occur when that happens or the correct parts should be the only ones that ""fit"" together like a puzzle. My improvements are really for older kids and if implemented would then require more pieces.Still a great toy, especially for the age group specified."
3,Not as entertaining as I hoped!,"My son played with this toy, only few times. He doesn't seem interested in it at all. Very dissapointed!"
2,"Okay for kids, but parents beware!","If your child receives this toy as a gift, you have two choices: re-gift it, or spend the rest of your life singing, ""You have the fist half of a pig and the last half of a cow...."" Your friends will hate you, and you may very well wake up in a cold sweat after dreaming that Farmer Tad is chasing you. My godson likes music, so he enjoys the musical elements, but there are so many other great toys out there. Save yourself!!!"
1,confusing for young ones,My kiddo got this when she was 12 months and we have encouraged her to use it ever since.. now she's 26 months and has never understood the concept. She's much more interested in Destruction rather than putting the shapes on there. Glad I didn't pay for it. Worthless.
5,Great toy for while your cooking dinner.,"Great toy to keep the kids busy while your cooking dinner.Great sound, love the animal mix ups!!Very cute toy!"
3,Not that durable but great concept.,"I bought this for my one year old as she is obsessed with the other magnets on my fridge. It stopped working after a week. Now she does drop it on the floor when she takes it off the fridge but since this is for a kid, it should be more durable. If she was banging it everywhere, I understand. But it is being ""dropped"" from a height of 12 inches. Toys made for little kids should be a bit tougher."
4,Must like banjo music,"My 2 year old granddaughter still plays with this even after 1 year. She is just getting to the point where she is able to match up the correct pieces. But, the banjo music part of the toy really sticks in one's head! All of us have been imitating the catchy songs it emits when a particular button is pressed! But, Natalie still uses the toy on every visit and it is one of her favorites. I can see this toy being used about 1 more year. Definitely a great value for the money!"
4,cute toy to put on the frig,"My 14 month old shows interest on and off. It's a good toy to entertain her for 5 minutes while I'm in the kitchen. She likes to push the leap frog button to play the main song but hasn't yet figured out the other features. She also likes to take the animal halves off and throw them on the floor, only sometimes actually putting them onto the frig. All of the animal halves have black marks on the corners from being thrown on the floor. Once my daughter figures out how to put the animals together and in the farm house, I think she will get bored with it b/c there's only 4 animals."
5,Great toy,"My 1-1/2 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves this toy. He loves dancing to Farmer Tad and I've noticed that he's gotten better at making matches over time. We're teaching him, 'quack, quack', 'mooooo' and 'oink, oink'. Whenever he hears it on the Fridge Farm he'll repeat it. It's been great for us. While we're in the kitchen, it keeps him entertained ... not to mention, it allows us to join in with him."
4,Great Fridge Toy,"When I was looking for a magnet to put on my fridge for my infant, this surely rates a great product."
3,Lower quality than previous versions,"My daughter (15 mo) has loved playing with this toy at 2 of her friends' houses, so we finally bought one for her for a road trip. I was so disappointed to find that the current version available feels & looks much cheaper than the older versions we saw at her friends'. The plastic is flimsy, and the toy has no weight to it. Also, the earlier models with the frog (rather than duck) sang a song when you pushed on the frog button, and this one doesn't. All in all I am disappointed that I bought this new rather than looking for a used, but higher-quality, version."
5,Great toy,My 1 yr old loves this toy as well as his 5 yr old brother enjoys playing with it with him. I definately reccommend this toy & I dont usually do that sort of thing
3,"Fun toy, but false advertising","Yes, this toy is cute and amusing to my not yet 18 month old son, but when Amazon features in large lettering that all pieces for this item can be stored on the back of it for easy travel, and I receive it to find out there's really no way to do that, I consider that false advertising. There are magnets on the back just a few of the pieces can stick to, but it certainly doesn't hold all of them, nor would I travel with it that way. That was the feature that sold the toy to me. Now I have another toy with numerous loose pieces to keep track of. We're keeping it because, again, my son likes the toy itself, but Amazon really should not be advertising this item that way."
5,Great!,My grandaughter is 18 months old and has had this item for about 4 months. She absolutely loves it and is has learned the colors and the names of the animals! Sometimes she will stand at the fridge and just push to hear the music while she dances. She also has the Fridge Phonics set and is already learning some of the letters at sight! What a geat idea! I wish they would make one with numbers!!!!
3,Cute but problems with the magnets,It's a very cute toy but the magnets on the back have started to scratch the refrigerator.
1,Lead concern,The paint chips easily on the animals and so I tested it for lead with Lead Check Swabs. The hair on the horse tested positive for low levels of lead on two tests. This is a great toy other than the fact it uses a toxic chemical!
2,Not that great,We requested this toy as a gift for our 1 yr old daughter after the great experience we had with Leap Frog's Fridge Phonics. The paint easily comes off the animals halves and the toy did not hold our daughter's interest.
2,Magnets will Travel,"Other then the magnet halves being ALL over my house, this toy was not a huge hit. The sounds are great, but it's hard for little hands to manipulate the magnets into just the right spot to make it work. I found once they were able to figure it out the entertainment value was pretty low and didn't last long.There were only a few facts about each animal and they were pretty basic. The main song is repetitive. I wouldn't buy this toy again."
4,Daughter loves it,"My daughter loves this toy and uses it a lot. We got this for her when she was 16 months old and she is now 2 and still enjoys it. I personally am not thrilled at the purple cow. I wish they would have kept all animals true to real color, but oh well. My daughter gets really excited when she makes a match, and she also loves the song it sings."
5,Another great Leap Frog Toy,"Good toy to keep the little ones buzy while mom or dad is in the kitchen. I can put on the side of the refridgerator that is away from what I am doing-so no one gets hurt. My children learn Spanish, English, animal sounds, logical thinking, and so much more. I find the kids play with it the most early in the morning while I am getting ready for work."
4,fun toy for the money,"I have a 10 month old and she really loves this toy. She crawls over to the refrigerator and presses the buttons. The animal sounds are very realistic. It is just a very cute and fun toy. The only thing is that I found it to be a little loud, even on the lowest volume setting."
5,Love it love it love it!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas 2004, when he was 20 mo. old. As soon as he opened it and saw the different animals, he was wanting to play with it! He loves the easy to hold shapes, and likes to match the animals halves - and loves to mismatch them!For myself, I like the volume control :) All kidding aside, it's an important thing to have! It has a switch with ""off"" ""low"" and ""high"" positions. I also like that each animal is a different color, helping the little ones match them more easily.It's also nice that inside the fridge isn't the most interesting thing in the kitchen anymore! Instead of begging me to open the fridge so he can peek around, he plays with his fridge toys.In addition to the Farm set, we also got the Alphabet set, which is also great. (and with volume controls!) Buy this one - buy the alphabet one! You won't be disappointed with either!"
5,My toddler is obsessed!,"Of all the gifts my daughter received this Christmas, she loves her magnetic Leap Frog Fridge Farm the most. She stands in front of the fridge dancing to the music and laughing/squealing and cries when she has to leave the toy.The music and speaking voice are pleasant (and usually are from Leap Frog, in our experience) and not overly loud. It's light enough that she can take it off the fridge and carry it around but heavy enough so it stays in place. If I had another magentized surface, like a desk or interior door, I would buy another for her.I bought this as a distraction so I could do work in the kitchen. She enjoys playing with the toy more than opening cupboards and she's so transfixed by it that she stays in one place where I can watch her.She is also younger than the recommended age; my daughter is 16 mo. and I find the toy we have to be perfectly safe and age-appropriate for her use."
5,11 month old loves it!,"My 11 month old daughter loves to look at animal books and loves for us to make the animal noises. She absolutely loves this toy. We have it on the fridge and she will sit and play while I cook dinner. Only con is that sometimes the pieces get lost under the fridge or she crawls away with them, lol. My older kids had this same toy when they were younger."
5,A toy that lasts,"My son got this his first Christams and loved it then and still loves it today at 2 1/2. He loved the music and animal sounds as a baby and now he loves making matches and loves ""Farmer Tad"" The only thing I disliked about it was that it said to store the extra pieces on the back...which doesn't work so well. We keep them in a washed out Kraft mayo container and that works much better."
5,Great for the hard to please kid!,"I bought this for my son for his 1st birthday. He loves it! He does not like toys that aren't ""big kid"" toys. He insists on playing with his older siblings toys and rarely touches his own, but he absolutely loves this toy. He loves the music and making the matches. At 2 years old he is still playing with it. Of all the toys I have ever bought any of my children at this age, this is the only toy that has kept their attention longer than a few days. I would recommend this toy to anyone! It is durable and adorable. Great buy!"
5,Great toy!,My son has played with this toy for almost a year and still has not gotten tired of it. My husband likes it because it goes on the refrigerator and doesn't take up space on the floor! It gives my son something to while I am occupied in the kitchen.
4,"Nice toy, a few complaints","We have had this toy for awhile and out of the Leapfrog toys it is used the least.Matching the animals is fun for awhile but after the kids get that one down this becomes pretty boring. Even though it would not compliment the farm motif I think more animal matches like lions, rhinos etc. would have been a nice touch to keep the kids interested.Also, it is LOUD. The low setting is plenty loud. The high setting I can hear on my bottom floor when my DS is playing with the set in his 2nd floor bedroom.I'd prefer to use the Baby Einstien's DVD to teach the kids farm animals."
5,Held up for 6 years...and going strong!,I bought this toy for my now 6 year old nephew when he was about a year old. It then got passed down to his little brother and now back to my daughter! It is a lot of fun and very educational too! It corrects the child about which animal is which without being negative about it!
3,Came with sapped batteries,"The toy arrived with sapped batteries that made the animals sound like they were being strangled. Other than that, it's ok. The toy could benefit from different singing voices for each animal, rather than the same woman singing every song in the same tone."
5,Great for Travel!,"Everyone has a fridge, right? So what better toy to take along on trips than one that sticks to a fridge AND is both educational and entertaining?! We stayed with family out of town over the holidays and this toy was a huge hit with our 18-mos old daughter, who quickly figured it out, as well as her 5 yr old brother. They spent lots of time dancing to the music and creating silly non-matches with the animal pieces. It's so nice that there's no mess on the floor to clean up and I love the suggestion another reviewer had to take along a metal clipboard for in the car play. Overall, we're very happy with this purchase!"
2,Not for small children who eat toys,"Would have given this a 4-star rating, except we noticed yesterday that the paint is chipping off of every piece that our child has eaten over the last 2 days. Not that this toy is for eating, but if it's being sold to 1 year-old children, expect it to go in the mouth. We're hoping the paint is non-toxic.That said, if your child isn't an in-the-mouth-goes-everything kind of kid, it's a lot of fun for them to mix and match animals. What's quite nice is that there's no ""wrong"" answer; even animals that don't belong together teach a lesson of mix-and-match, and provide appropriate animal sounds. Downside for small hands is that the magnets are relatively strong, and fit well inside the ""barn doors,"" which means getting them out if your a little person isn't so easy.So, would have been better if not edible, if easier to use for small hands. For older todlers and children, would certainly recommend."
4,cute,"I just purchased this as a gift for my grandson's 1st birthday. Its cute but not as much as what I'd expected. Its a red barn with 4 different animals--each in 2 pieces.You can mix and match the pieces and they make sounds. It tells you when you've made a match and sings a short song about the animal and color as in WOW, you've made a purple cow-you made a cow. Then the cow will moo. Its all magnetic so will stay on the refrigerator or it can be played with on the floor. I do think Liam will like it since its bright, the music and voices are very clear and I'm sure he will be entrigued by it. I would purchase this again even if it wasn't quite what I expected. Leap Frog products are almost always great learning toys and theres only been 1 that I was somewhat disapointed in. However the baby I bought it for wasn't so what can I say--they're worth the money. I think parents and grandparents should buy as many of these toys as possible for their little ones."
3,OK TOY BUT HAS A FLAW,"My child seems to like this product although I am on the fence with this one. My main gripe is that the description of the horse is incorrect. The toy says it is ""Orange Horse"", but the horse is actually BROWN. Leap Frog Enterprise needs to hire someone who isn't colorblind for quality control in my opinion."
3,close supervision recommended,"My daughter got this toy for her first birthday. She loves playing with the animals and running around the house holding them. She also likes to put them in her mouth as all one year olds do. By doing this she ended up eating the paint (or whatever it is) off a few of the animals. So, know I keep the barn low enough for her to push the button and the animals up high so she can't reach them. We take them down once and awhile and play with them together, but it's a shame she can't enjoy them at her own level. Cute toy but I recommend close supervision."
5,My son loves this toy!,I got this toy for my 20 month-old son for Christmas and he loves playing with it! He's really into animals right now and he loves being able to hear the different animal sounds. The songs aren't obnoxious and it really encourages imagination by creating funny animal combinations. The pieces are easy to take off and put on and the animal shapes are very cute!
3,My two kids would not play with it,"I have a 4 years old who got this toy 2 years ago. He was never intersted in it much. His brother is 20 months and also loose interest after 1 minute playing with it. Unlike other users I did not have problem with the quality of the toy. It is durable but again, maybe it is because it does not get used much in our house."
4,my daughter really likes this,"I recently bought this for my 16 month old daughter. She really enjoys it becuase she loves animals, and it helps teach her the barnyard animals and the sounds they make. The only problem my duaghter has is fitting the pieces in correctly but I supose she will learn that as she continues to play with it! I also like it because it keeps her out from under my feet when I'm trying to cook but I can still see what she is doing!"
5,Just what baby loves,"My grandaughter loves anything in the kitchen. She loves to put things in and out, so we thought this would be great.She is 10 months old. I bought one for her house. She sits at the fridge forever and changes out the animals with a little help. But as the days go by she's doing it on her own more. She loves the sounds and songs. She bounces and dances. She loves it so much, that I bought one for my house. She heads for the kitchen when she comes to grandmothers. My daughter bought one for a friend's baby. She said her baby loved it too. This will be the gift to buy."
5,Good toy,"My son was 11 months when he got this. He LOVES magnets!! So far, he only pulls the animals out when you put them in & then carrys them with him. Even though he cannot put the animals in, he loves to hear the songs that it sings. I think this is a great toy!"
5,Cute and fun!,"My 17 month old got this for his first birthday and has loved it before we even managed to get it out of the package. He does periodically get scared of some of the sounds but that has been a phase he's been going through with animal sounds since his birthday and not just this toy. When he is afraid of a certain sound for awhile, we just put that animal up higher on the fridge until he gets over it.He likes being able to mix up the animal parts and make it make different sounds and likes the songs it plays. He also just likes to play with the magnets themselves. It is a good toy to occupy a little one while they're keeping mom or dad company in the kitchen."
3,Great product except the magnets,"My son loves the fridge magnet idea, and is always playing with the Leapfrog word whammer. He also loves to play with this Farm Animal version. We have been happy with the product on paper (he enjoys it), but frankly the magnets are of very poor quality compared to our previously purchased word whammer. Almost half of the animal magnets don't magnetize strongly enough to stay on the fridge (they stick mildly and slowly slide down and off the fridge). I may have just gotten a defective model."
4,Fun for little ones,"We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. Although she can't match the animals yet, she has a lot of fun pushing the buttons to make the sounds. It is great that it even makes up animals when the animal parts don't match by naming the pieces of the two halves. The only problem we are having is that it doesn't stay on the fridge. The pieces are really easy to take off the fridge and end up all over the house as our daughter wanders around with them."
5,Little ones love it!,"My friends threw a huge circus-style birthday 1st party for their little boy and he got a ton of presents. They say out of them all, this is the one he plays with most. He likes to hang out with mom in the kitchen and interact with the toy on the fridge.After hearing about that, I bought it for my nephew's first birthday. It's not on the fridge, just on the ground, but he's crazy over it as well."
5,Great fun in the kitchen!,"My daughter got this for her first birthday. She loves this toy! She has a bit of trouble getting the pieces to fit, but I'm sure that will change with time. She loves pressing Tad to play the farm songs. She walks over to the toy, presses the button and then dances. It's been great while I'm cooking dinner!"
4,Gr8 for kids,My kid used to play this toy not even on fridge but also anywhere at the homeThe blocks and the device is strudyLoved it!
3,fun but will scratch you stainless steal,"My son played with this while it was on the fridge, but we noticed it left permanant scratches on our stainless steal. May good for black or white refridgerators.."
4,Keeps my 23 month old entertained,"This set does keep my 2 year old entertained for brief periods of time while I am cooking and I love that it has a volume on it. The songs are cute and not too annoying. ONly reason it lost a star is because I wish the animals were the color they are supposed to be. The sheep is purple for Petes Sakes. Kinda card to teach my toddler correct animal identification with this. Just a small annoyance to me like schools that use K's in their name KIDS KAMPUS SKOOL.....ummmmmm really?Otherwise I would recommend this toy. Funny enough, my 10 year old son likes mixing the animals up (1/2 cow - 1/2 sheep) for my 23 month old who thinks that is hilarious."
4,MAGNETIC ANIMAL REVIEW,"I sent the gift to my son for my one and a half year old grandson. Verdict? The boy enjoys the toy and the parents find the music ""obnoxious"". If it keeps him occupied while my daughter-in-law makes dinner, my mission is accomplished!"
3,good toy,"My 1-year-old grandaughter loves this toy. The tune is catchy, and whether you correctly match the animals or not, you still get a cute song. The volume can also be controlled, which is a plus. I definitely recomment this for toddlers."
5,Awsome Learning Toy,I purchased the Farm Magnetic Animal Set for my 16 month old Grandson for Christmas this year. His parents put it on the Fridge as soon as he opened it. He immediately started playing with it. He loves it. Its a joy to see him play with it.
3,Magnet Problems,"My 1 year old daughter received this product as a birthday gift. Once I took the pieces out of the packaging, I discovered that two of magnets are so weak that they won't stick to the refrigerator at all. I contacted customer service to request new pieces. After giving them all the info twice, I was told that they were out of replacement pieces and that I could call back in 3 weeks to see if they had any. If they are out of replacement pieces, it makes me wonder how many of these products are defective. If I had the receipt, this Fridge Farm would be going back to the store."
2,Fun Toy But Paint Chips Easilly!!!!! DON'T BUY!!!!,"This is a really fun toy. My son received it for his 1st birthday. My son LOVED it but the paint chipped off within 2 weeks of him playing with it. I found this out when he had weird green and yellow flecks around his mouth. I quickly figured it out that it was from the farm set. I contacted LeapFrog and let them know that. They said it wasn't a concern to them that the paint flakes off. If we wanted a replacement or credit towards another toy, we'd have to ship the toy to them and pay for shipping on a new item. I found that to be ridiculous. I had a couple problems with some Fisher Price toys and they shipped out replacements right away, no questions asked, no money required.This toy would still be a part of this household if the paint didn't chip off. For that, and for LeapFrogs' lack of proper customer service, it went in the garbage."
2,The Year the horses came,"I found this story VERY hard to stick with. I had just wasn't able to connect with the story. The first half of the book felt like it was lacking details. What few details there were, seemed to portray some tribes as free loving of everyone and everything and the other tribes as viscous killing rapists. I read the reviews of this author and this series,and started reading this with high hopes of a great and enthralling tale. I MUST say that I am very disappointed. The story ended abruptly, and in an odd way, as if the next chapter was on the next page but that was it. I WOULD NOT recommend this book to any youngreader due to some of the killing and raping details. I had purchased all 3 books in this series so I will read the other 2 and hope that they're better than this one."
4,A delightful yarn,"Mary Mackey is an extraordinarily gifted storyteller, and has crafted an enthralling world, at once coherent and diverse. Some may dispute the underlying archeological and anthropological premises; so what (most archeologists and anthropologists can't seem to agree on which side is up, anyway)? They are - although Ms. Mackey herself might think differently - irrelevant to one's enjoyment of this delightful yarn. The more so as Ms. Mackey never preaches, never talks down to her audience - and would be more than welcome to sit by this reader's side at a campfire."
3,Interesting,"My main review is in book three. In short, this is a very sexy group of people who use sex as a social statement, but mostly of the oral version which could upset teens.At lest the trilogy is not like another prehistoric series where the main character is a pushover for any one. She hardly met a man she didn't like"
5,"exciting, romantic and beautifully written","I fell in love with the characters. Her description of the places and events was such, that I could see the places. The story was so romantic and touching. I cried and cheered. Thank you, Mary.. there was one problem with the book.. it had to end. I could have continued reading it on and on."
4,"I was ""wow-ed""!","A great read- one of those books you rush home from work to continue reading. The author gives a poignant account of an Earth-worshipping culture as it clashes with a male-centered culture of destruction and death. As a Wiccan myself, these battles are still being fouight today, so it seems all too real at times.The book is not without it's problems- it ends abruptly, perhaps to leave the reader hungering for the sequel? Also it seemed targeted at an 18-year-old female reader, who might typically love horses, and be enchanted with adventure and heroic male characters. At times the character development seemed to center around the two romantic characters, at the expense of Marrah's brother and other Goddess figures who seemed most interesting but were not well developed.All of that not-withstanding, I still found it a great read and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel from Amazon."
4,"Everything Smaller Than Expected, but Works as Promised","This 3 in 1 Breakfast Machine contains a toaster oven, hot plate, and coffee maker. All the items are smaller than if you bought them separately, but if you are tight on space this is definitely handy.The toaster oven was probably the biggest negative. It is only wide enough to fit 1 slice of break. Fortunately there is a top burner and a bottom burner so you can stack 2 pieces of bread on top of each other and flip them in the middle of cooking.I cooked eggs in a basket on the hotplate and it cooked the egg in about 5 or 6 mins.Pros:Space SavingDial Timer 15 mins maxCan turn on/off top and bottom burner individuallyReusable Coffee FilterEasy to clean removable hot plateComes with baking panNegatives:All components pretty small, can't toast large itemsDon't expect to cook for large parties, but if just cooking for yourself not bad.Timer clicking down can get annoying"
1,Coffee maker stopped working after about 8 uses - no help from manufacturer.,"Great concept, especially for our RV but the coffee maker stopped working after about 8 uses - no help from manufacturer."
3,okay for the money,"This works as promised. Takes little space in our tiny camper, which was the idea. The coffeemaker is a bit hard to deal with and I'm using paper filters now. Takes awhile to toast bread, does a fried or scrambled egg well. Overall, fine for quick breakfasts for one or two before hitting the road."
2,Elite toaster oven,Found the product useful...but the plastic handle on the timer broke...bad idea to use plastic parts and the coffee filter basket would not stay in the hole it was suppose to be in...The product could have been made much better...But for the price...It was good. Lasted about 6 months...I Received about $7 a month out of the ease of using it. So the purchase was justified. Getting ready to throw it in the garbage and believe it or not buy another one!
3,Torn on how I should rate...,"Let me preface this review by saying I love Annie Chun's products.That being said.. I'm not a huge fan of this specific flavor.Like all of the other Annie Chun products I've consumed, this one is no exception in having a nicely sized portion, excellent noodles, and being the ONLY product I've ever consumed that had dehydrated vegetables that actually tasted/felt like they were fresh once re-hydrated.What is keeping this from being 4-5 stars is that the Teriyaki sauce is just terrible. I truly cannot imagine how people can say it's ""delicious"". It doesn't even taste like Teriyaki. I'm eating my last bowl of it right now, and I would say the flavor just tastes like terribly seasoned soy sauce.Overall, I would give the noodles/veges/portion size 5 stars, and the sauce 2 stars (generously)."
1,terrible,"These taste terrible. I threw away the bowl I cooked after one bite, and I will prepare the noodles from the other bowls with any sauce other than the sauce they came with."
1,Sauce not tastey at all!!,"The sauce has a vinegar flavor not like regular teriyaki. As a matter of fact the thai noodles don't taste like thai sauce either.I would not buy this product if you care about taste.Noodle okay, spongey though."
1,Disgusting Never Again,I bought a package of these noodles and one from simply Asia brand. I tried the simply Asia ones first and they were so gross I had to throw them out. I was still hungry and decided to go for the Auntie Chuns but that was it. The noodles are so nasty they smell like plastic and I don't know why they call it teriyaki flavor if all it tastes like is soy sauce with extra sodium. I would rather eat ramen noodles for a month than have to eat one of these again. I am definitely staying away from Asian microwaveable foods.
2,Practically no veggies; just noodles and sauce,"I agree with Audes, the picture on the front amounts to misrepresentation. Even calling the tiny amount of dried veggies in the packet ""topping"" is stretching it. And the procedure for draining the water from the bowl (in which I lost yet more of the topping) is downright dangerous. The noodles and sauce taste fine, but there's nothing to the product but that, for all practical purposes. Will not purchase again."
1,"Annie Chun's Noodle Bowl Teriyaki - Pain, much pain!!!","I had this for the first time today and I am in so much pain. My mouth, throat, and stomach feel like I am on fire. I LOVE spicy food, but I feel like I have been burned clean through with this dish.I will never, NEVER, eat this again. Could this be poison?"
1,Gross!,"I just had this stuff for lunch, and it's terrible! The noodles are okay, the dehydrated vegetables were fine (not as many as pictured though), but the sauce is SO GROSS! It tastes nothing like teriyaki! It also smells like crap, I'm getting sick just from the smell.I took one bite and that was it. Not buying this product ever again, I'll stick with ramen thank you."
5,High quality noodles,I heard about Annie Chun on TV and had to try this noodles. Can report they are outstanding.They are not that hard to prep and cook. Annie hit the Teriyaki flavor dead on perfect.These are well worth the 5 star rating for value and taste.
1,Ugh,"Looked good on the package, seemed worth trying for a quick dinner at work. All I can say is ""ugh"". The noodles are acceptable. The sauce is dreadful - a mixture of salt and plastic."
1,HORRID!,"This is the absolute WORST noodle bowl I've ever had the displeasure of tasting!! ANNIE CHUN PRODUCTS ARE HORRID!! I wish I could get my money back. There are no vegetables to speak of, the noodles are sticky and the sauce is way too salty! I learned from this dreadful experience to always read the reviews first! Yuck!"
2,Weak Sauce,The sauce is the deal breaker for me. Its basically just straight soy sauce. It is not Teriyaki sauce. The noodles are fantastic however. If it only had real Teriyaki sauce it would probably be pretty good. And I don't even mind soy sauce. But this tastes like salt-less soy sauce. Its horrible. I will be eating the last 5 meals with store bought sauce.
4,Really 3 stars but I don't care for ramen noodles,"For a fast alternative to junk food this was hearty, easy to prepare and fast. I would have liked to see more vegtables in it. It enclosed a tiny vegi season packet and terriyaki sauce(sweet). Flavor was good but if you pour this sauce on ramen noodles, they would taste good. Why 4 stars? I like the way the noodles are packaged. I bought this a grocery store and would not buy again or buy this on Amazon. I ended up throwing some chopped up noodles in mine."
1,What the...,"This is terrible food. It tastes like chemicals... even the thick 'teriyaki' sauce they give you can't hide the noxious flavor. On top of that it is so grossly over packaged I actually felt bad trying to get to the food, yet on the back they say they're ""saving the earth one bowl at a time"". I looked for further information on this magical plastic bowl, but found none, and they invite you to donate 19 cents, but fail to mention their donations to this cause. Classic ""green"" company, all marketing, no substance and making more bad food for people to digest. I don't know about the other products, but the Teriyaki Bowl is awful. No debating that."
5,"Quick, decent tasting, and inexpensive","My kids, ages twelve and fourteen, love these things better than they love their dad. With boiling water, they think themselves to be gourmet chefs... this is like, ""food of the gods"" for them when they come home ""starving"" from school. For parents, that's a great thing. Trader Joe's sells this product for about $2 apiece. I wish I could find them online for less, or at least a comparable price. I have to drive about 100 miles to find a TJ's. I grab a bucketload of these every time I drive there."
1,Noodle sause has bad taste,"Although the shipping was quick, the taste of the actual product did not appeal to me. The sauce packets used in these noodles (and all of their other products, it very similar) was not very good. It was too sour and had a distinct off-flavor. I ended up not even putting in any of the sauce packets just to finish the carton off. I prefer the noodle bowls and ramin sold in supermarkets to any of the Annie Chun noodles, and the store bought versions are much cheaper, but may not be as healthy."
4,If you want to control your music then this is what you should buy.,"This product is a hands free headset/headphones for most sony ericsson phones. I used it with my w810. It works very well. The sound quality is just like the quality from the headphones that came with the w810. This thing lets you control the volume, change songs, and stop and start your music without having to reach into your pocket. The only thing that is keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that there is a slight delay after you push the button. Basically it takes a second or two for the phone to react once you give it a command. This can be kind of annoying. Its not a deal breaker though. Overall this is a very nifty device."
3,Decent headphone for the price,"I bought these to use with my Sony Ericsson W518a phone. They work, but the sound quality isn't up to par. Lot's of static in these headphones."
3,Fine. not like the original received with the phone,"Fine. not like the original received with the phone, the original with the phone had far better sound compared to this"
1,shotty craftsmanship,This headset would have been great.. if it didn't break within a week of use.. the part that plugs into the phone cracked and now won't connect.
4,Magnetic dart board,"I bought this through Amazon; and as always, it was a good experience. The dart boards are very cool and fun for kids to play with. I got 2 for my grandkids - one for each parent's home. The darts on this particular brand are somewhat small so I'm not sure if it they'll be as good as others I own. I don't expect it's going to make a big difference but they are lighter. Time will tell, but I think these are great dart boards."
4,A Real Suspense,A very suspenseful novel with many twist and turns! The story will keep you guessing. I look forward to reading more of his writings!
2,"I didn't realize this was a ""Christian"" book...","Well, at least I didn't realize it until the ""God"" references started cropping up in an otherwise interesting story. Amazon didn't bother to mention in the Product Details section that this was a book in that genre. If they had I wouldn't have wasted my money. Looks like I need to do more research before I spend my money."
2,Not enjoyable in the least,"Bell is definitely a lawyer...not a novelist. His characters are stereotypical in every essence and not very well developed. I found myself disliking each of the characters more and more as they stumbled through their own journeys of typical and unimaginative self-discovery. The twist at the end of the book was not very believable nor was the storyline well developed. Overall, I would not recommend."
2,???????WHA????????,"Sorry but with every new release from Kalonji I am becomming more and more dissappointed. Weak album Sizzla. I had expected so much more. Who ever it is that's making you're music, get rid of them star. Bless upI'm sorry, most distinguished gentlemen/ladies above me here, but I'm comparing this to the albums sizzla puts out that I cant bear to stop playing. Yes he is changing with the time but with his production schedule, he's loosing the gut feel he always portayed through his music/lyrics.Sorry, still a **"
1,Don't waste your time or money if you want music!,"Once again, those who want to make money shamelessly off of Deep Purple fans have done it again. I am certainly a big fan, but this disc was a disgrace to the ""Machine Head"" name. I had hoped that this disc would FINALLY be THE disc that gave us complete live performances of the fantastic tracks on this album/CD. There were none that I saw. After wading through the ""primary"" material I lightly checked out the ""bonus"" material. As it didn't seem much different I gave up. I am thankful that I chose to rent it via Netflix before purchasing it. This disc is worse than the sham ""Made in Japan"" documentary.If you want interviews and nothing but tantalizing clips then this disc is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time nor money."
1,no subtitulado,"ESTE ES UN ITEMS QUE A TODO FANS DE DEEP PURPLE NOS GUSTARIA TENER - YO YA LO VI, DEBIDO A QUE UN AMIGO LO TIENE . EN REALIDAD NO ES NADA DE OTRO MUNDO, SALVO IMAGES EN VIVO DEL AÑO1973. TE DA BRONCA PORQUE TE MUESTRAN MATERIAL QUE DESEARIAMOS TENER Y ELLOS LO GUARDAN NO SE PARA QUE - ESTE DVD DURA APORXIMADAMENTE 1 HORA - DIFINITIVAMENTE ES PODRE - EN REALIDAD TENIA MUCHA EXPECTATIVA HASTA QUE UNO LO TIENE EN LA MANO Y SE DA CUENTA QUE SALE DEFRAUDADO - Y A LOS SEÑORES DEL SELLO EDITOR LES PIDO QUE NO ESTAFEN MAS AL CONSUMIDOR , SI ANUNCIAN QUE ESTA SUBTITULADO QUE ASI SEA. NO ESTA SUBTITULADO - ASI QUE SI NO SABES INGLES SOLAMENTE PODRAS OBSERVAR LAS IMAGENES DE ESTE SIMPLE DOCUMENTAL"
5,Great Companion To a Great Album,"Part of the fantastic ""Classic Album"" series, this one chronicles the making of the landmark Machine Head album, one of the most influential hard rock albums ever made. The interviews are fantastic, with all the members providing input. Great extras, too. A must purchase DVD."
3,I wanted to like this more,"I am roughly the same age as the musicians in this group. MII is THE DP lineup as far as I am concerned. And Machine Head is their defining album. I REALLY wanted to like this DVD.I had so thoroughly enjoyed the Pink Floyd DSOTM doc, that I went after others in the Classic Album series. But this one matches neither the insight nor the technical ""under the covers"" nuggets found in the Floyd's.There were good moments. The Smoke on the Water story, although pretty well known by now, is entertaining and informative nonetheless...and the Highway Star ""how do you write a song"" clip was cute. But no real Blackmore contribution other than the SOTW riff (did you see Gilmour's stuff on DSOTM??) and Paice, who was one of the era's best drummers, was a wallflower.Entertaining if you like DP MII as much as I do, but far inferior to others in this series, to be perfectly honest."
2,Overdubbed footage. Big letdown,"When I saw this DVD for sale I figured, Great finally some live footage from the Deep Purple early days. Well, most of the live footage was overdubbed with studio music and some of the footage or I should say very short snips of it was overdubbed with a different song than they were playing live! It was mostly interviews. How many times are they going to tell the Smoke on the water story? It was a yawn fest."
2,no subtitles,MACHINE HEAD could be a great dvd because its music is wonderful.But it isn't iust so.Where are the subtitles mentioned in the back cover? J think they are essential in a documentary
1,It's [bad],"I want my money back; they forgot the first 40 second of the first song where it whines up, with out that hook you don't or can't enjoy this DVD"
3,Modern Resonance transformer Design Theory,"This ""book"" is actually a spiral bound collection ofloose leaf notes, hand sketches, and typed discussions confined to thedesign of Tesla style, air core, resonance transformers.However, the total surpasses the initial reaction to the cover. This is a concise and yet fairly comprehensive design note book for anyone interested in design of a Tesla coil. It assumes a basic theoretical understanding of the Tesla and tends to focus on in depth issues of design such the implications of physical dimensions on Q factors. There are also some interesting historical tidbits thrown in for those interested in that type of thing.Over all, an enjoyable and interesting read for anyone interested in a more in depth discussion of Tesla coil function than is normally given in the ""how to"" type manuals often found on the web or in a magazine."
2,"where's ""maybe god's a woman too"" ???","Like many others I was extremely disappointed that the soundtrack of the fabulous movie does not include this song ""maybe god's a woman too"". Would really like to have this song to my collection but just can't find it. Anyone can help?"
5,THE BEST SOUNDTRACK EVER,I enjoyed The Thing Called Love because it was a soundtrack for everyone and it had Trisha Yearwood she is great
2,so sad for river and the others!,I find great the singing actors of the movie. How unfortunate not to have a REAL SOUNDTRACK!
2,Unrecognizable songs,I thought the movie was fablous but I don't recognize most of the songs. Don't waste your money!
1,Missing Original Artists!,"Mainly I was interested in Samantha Mathis singing ""Maybe, God's a Woman Too."" As I looked down the list of songs, none were by Ms. Mathis or River Phoenix. Too bad. Not interested. Perhaps one day, you'll get the original sound track."
3,"The dvd is awesome with extended fetures, but what about the music?","I absolutely LOVE River Phoenix's voice...amamzing!! why would they not put it on the soundtrack? Samantha Mathis and Dermot Mulroney really add to the music as well. If they made this extended DVD version, well maybe an extended soundtrack? Thats what the movie and the storyline is about; its about their music. The music on the soundtrack was ok, but disappointing because the songs you love in the movie aren't there, Someone else is singing the ones that are in the soundtrack. I just wish we knew how to let the ""higher up"" people know we want the REAL music!!"
1,That's Messed Up,"I have not bought the CD or any other audio of this soundtrack because the music that I and many people want is not on there. Why are the entertainment industries choosing songs that the consumers do not want? Regular people should be choosing these songs, and not the people who control the soundtrack compilations."
1,Clarification Folks,"The song everyCowfolk thinks is ""Maybe God's a Woman , Too"" (5 Stars!) is actually called ""BIG DREAM""...check the credits at the end of the flick.And it is a complete mistake NOT having the specific songs from this great movie on the so-called ""soundtrack"". So I too will pass on this collection of decent songs because I want the songs FROM THE MOVIE. duh. ""I Don't Care if it Rains or Freezes as Long as I've Got My Plastic Jesus Sittin on the Dashboard of My Car"" is not on the ""Cool Hand Luke"" soundtrack either. Go figure."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this also thinking that I'd be able to hear River Pheonix and Samantha Mathis singing as they did in the movie.. If those tracks were on the the CD, I would have easily given this soundtrack a 5 star rating.. As it is, I'm being generous by giving it 3 stars.. BOO to the record producers who didn't include those songs on the soundtrack!"
1,What You're Looking For Is NOT Here!,"I was so excited to get this CD as a gift. What a disappointment to have neither of the Samantha Mathis songs on it, especially ""Big Bar Hair"" (what a fun song) and ""Maybe God's a Woman Too."" Returned it without even opening the CD, as I mainly wanted those two songs! Guess I'll have to keep rewinding the videotape to hear them. Bummer...."
2,Where are the originals?,"There's always something missing on soundtracks. Just like on this one. Where's Trisha Yearwood's ""She's In Love With The Boy"", Elvis' ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" and ""Make The World Go Away"", Johnny Cash's ""Hey Porter""...Movie is a really nice presentation of what country music's all about. But the soundtrack is lame. Why did they put on different versions of ""Until Now"" (Rodney Crowell), ""Blame It On Your Heart"" (Deborah Allen) and ""Street Of Love"" (Kevin Welch) when movie versions are absolutely better. The only songs I really like are ""I Can't Understand"" (Trisha Yearwood), ""Partners In Wine (Randy Travis) and ""Standing On A Rock"" (Rodney Crowell).This could be a really nice country songbook."
1,"Good film, Rubbish soundtrack.","Please consider very much whether or not to buy this because i personally think it is a waste of time. It has less than half the songs on here and most of them aren't the ones most people like anyway and if they are then they are sung by different people rather than the people like River and Samantha who sang them in the film (Personally I think that they did a way better job than the guys on the CD anyway). It's just such a shame that such an amazing and inspiring film could have such a rubbish soundtrack. Please, if you really like the film, don't buy the soundtrack since once you've heard it, it goes way down on the list of things you hate and most of the time drags the film down with it."
1,Where are the songs in the movie?,"Definitely not a soundtrack. More like a ""my take on the soundtrack."" Like the other reviewers said, where are the songs that were featured in the movie? This is a disgrace!"
1,PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT !,"It's a disappointment to find out that this is NOT the original soundtrack. No songs by River Phoenix, Samantha Mathis or Dermot Mulroney. Where can those performances be found ??????"
2,The CD-ROM does not work on WINDOWS-95 !,"I was very disappointed when I tried to install this book onto my PC and failed many times ! Seems something wrong with this CD-ROM and it can not be recognized by Win-95 ! If anyone out there has any idea how to install it or get a refund on the CD (not the book itself, since I still need it) from Amazon, please let me know. Many thanks in advance !"
5,Another dynamic duo release...,"If you've been a fan of their previous releases then this too is for you. Ella's voice sounds very mellow on these recordings, and she really swings on ""I've Got The World On A String"". Her vocal interpretational skills are superb. As usual Joe Pass is in great form also."
2,Heard it all before,"Divided Multitude sound like a band that has developed its skills just enough to be able to copy its influences. I was reminded (and not subtly, either) of Pallas, Dream Theater and Symphony X, and even Queen in some of the vocal arrangements. That being said, Divided Multitude lack the virtuosity, speed and creativity of these bands. The singer sounds like every other singer in the genre, and the lyrics are poor. They probably should have sung in Norwegian - that might have made the album more interesting. As it is, there are some really predictable, cliche and hokey forced rhymes - and thinly disguised Norwegian accents. Nevertheless, the music is often catchy - even entertaining if you play it loud enough. It's not a bad album, per se. It's just desperately lacking in originality.Is it a convincing attempt at progressive metal? Yes. You know what they're up to and recognize the contours of the genre throughout. Is it an impressive attempt at progressive metal? Hardly."
5,Almost Better than the movie!,"One of the best things about the film Dazed and Confused was the killer soundtrack that we heard while watching it. With artists like Foghat, The Runaways, War, Alice Cooper, and Black Saboth, just to name a few, they made the movie about the 70's."
3,"Good soundtrack, with a couple of glitches.","More of an FYI, as this is otherwise a decent CD:Tush by ZZ Top: the version that appears here is an 80's remix, from when much of their catalog was remixed to sound more like ""Eliminator"" (added echo/80's drum sound), not the original 1975 version. The original can be found on the old ""Best Of ZZ Top"" CD, as well as on the more recent ""Fandango"" remaster.Rock And Roll All Nite by Kiss: also an 80's remix (from 1988's ""Smashes, Thrashes and Hits""). The original 1975 studio version can be found on ""Dressed To Kill"".Otherwise the sound on this disc is quite good (not over-compressed/maximized like more recent releases), and the track selection is fine (save for the use of remixes)."
4,Aerosmith????,Great collection.... My only question is where is Aerosmith???? The first song played at the very beginning is Sweet Emotion and the whole plot of the movie is going on summer vacation with the goal to get Aerosmith tickets. Aerosmith is also absent from the second CD
5,The movie's great and the soundtrack makes it all good.,I loved this movie so much! I own it and have probably seen it a million times. I can't wait until I get the second soundtrack. You guys should deffinately get it. It's worth it.
5,great soundtrack....,"Simply put, the Dazed and Confused Soundtrack 1 and 2 is the best 70's rock compilation ever put together."
4,Good Music,"These were two solid sessions by Miles. They each stand up very well when compared to the sessions for Prestige done around this time frame; these have a clearer recorded sound and reasonably definitive performances (Miles sounds cool and beautiful).The highlights here were to be revisited (""Dear Old Stockholm"" a few years later on Miles' Columbia debut, and ""Weirdo"" here becomes ""Sid's Ahead"" a few years later) but there is still some nice jazz here and very nice ambience to the sessions. Horace Silver's piano on the latter session sparkles."
5,Great early Miles,"This cd shows the early stages of the Miles genius developing. This was when he was a struggling musician, I think. He certainly was not srtuggling with his horn. His tone signature is unmistakeable but still somewhat raw in this set. Fabulous listening."
4,Fabulous Times,"I was introduced to this movie by my roommates, and then I told all my friends about it. I absolutely love the movie, even though its longer than traditional american movies the story is very engaging and the music and dancing, while a bit different, are fun. The english translation in the subtitles leaves a bit to be desired and the sound quality isn't very good, the music and singing is very loud but the dialogue is quiet, you end up turning up and down the volume often. This isn't your traditional love story, its three all woven into one combinged with a good message about friendship and forgiveness. And there isn't any lewdness or any sex scenes at all so its appropriate for all ages!"
2,I don't understand the hype.,"So I read all these wonderful reviews and went out and rented the movie, b/c everybody LOVED it. I don't get it. I just sort of wished it were over. And I Really tried to like it. That's about all there is to say about that."
3,Solid Read,"This is one of those fast, easy-to-read novels that I managed to finish in about 24 hours while on vacation.Compared to some of his other works, this one is less horror, but still suspenseful. The main character, Avery, is out fishing one day when some punk teens come down to rob him, but the leader of the pack decides to blow the man's dog's brains out instead. What follows is Avery's quest to get an apology from the leader of the pack and see that he is punished. But when the boy and his father decide to play hardball, then hell breaks loose.This was a good, quick read, and the main character was well developed. A few parts seemed a bit too propostrous (like a beautiful, young reporter sleeping with the old man-- kind of came from nowhere), but the final result was satisfying. Also, the Leisure paperback version includes the novella, THE PASSENGER, which was a pretty brutal story that was more like what you'd expect from Ketchum.Overall, I suggest this book!"
3,"Not Great, Not Bad!","I went into my first read of Ketchum thinking this was going to be on the stronger side of horror fiction. He certainly has a way with words, so I expect to try some of his other books, but this is not a horror story at all. I should have read some more in depth reviews on the story, which is my fault. I recommend others who are looking for the horror side of Ketchum to start with The Girl Next Door or on the brief side, Peaceable Kingdom for a variety of his short stories. Those will be my next reads."
4,"Pass the ""Red"" Ketchum, please.","I liked this book. Sometimes Ketchum gets too graphic. So much so, you wonder why is he even bothering with a story line. This book has very real characters and something unbelievable happens to his best friend. I can see this happening in this day and age of senseless violence. You know that he's not going to let these people get away with it or let them off the hook, no matter how hard he has to fight or how nasty things get. Good for him! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was too short! The short story at the end was a nice treat, too."
3,Enjoyable With Some Reservations,"It may not be the most original story and I don't know why the book was labeled as a ""horror"" novel, but Red is very entertaining nonetheless. A little predictable at times, however, I couldn't seem to put it down. It's more of a drama with some aspects of a thriller that is well written and contains some powerful images. It's such a simple story that I think might make a better movie than a book -- one of the rare times. I look forward to seeing more of Ketchum's work from the Leisure horror line... let's just hope that ""horror"" is what it is. The other novella in the novel is called The Passenger and it's not nearly as good (2 and 1/2 stars). The Passenger goes off on many strange tangents that never seem believable and contains too many coincidences. That said, it's still worth buying for the story of Red."
2,needn't be re(a)d,"i agree with thye review from publishers weekly. i would like to add that this is standard stuff, we've since it before and it wasn't good the first time. too slow to be suspenceful, too unoriginal to be interesting, the writing style isn't that bad. this is too simple, and it could easily have been done better"
3,I have tremendous respect for this guy's writing,"As a writer, Jack Ketchum doesn't have to prove anything to anyone--and I know this, and write the following knowing this.The tale is basically fine. The only problem I had with it is when the author goes into the protagonist's background (and this basically ""derailed"" the story for me--in that it was way too much that I wanted or needed to know.)Also, I half-expected a big payoff at the end, instead of the ""lackluster"" finish we got.But okay, the writer writes the story he feels like writing--and owes nothing to anyone. That's the way it (ultimately) should be.This is merely one man's opnion here.All I can say is Jack Ketchum has earned his respect/fame/success (and worked his [...] off for it, no doubt) because the man (has proven with other books) that he knows what the hell he is doing."
2,A huge fan but not of this book,"I love Jack Ketchum's novels but never got around to reading this one. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of horror in this novel and the slow pace. Especially since the novel is basically a novella. Also some of the character's dynamics didn't make sense to me,,, for example the young reporter that falls in lust with the main character. Ketchum doesn't give any backdrop or anything for this encounter other than describing the man as a less than desirable physical speciman. But we are to believe that she falls in love with him INSTANTLY?????? The novel is too short to give an in-depth character study but yet the book isn't intense either like some novellas are.for example, the novella that it's packaged with ""The passenger"" is much better at pacing and intensity."
2,Not what I expected,I've been hearing the name Jack Ketchum for a while now and finally decided to read one of his books. There are so many 5 star reviews here for Red I have to wonder if I read the same book. I was incredibly disappointed. The writing itself is nothing more than competent. The characters are cardboard cutouts standing in for real people and the plots are wholly unoriginal. The story seems to be there mainly for Ketchum to set up violent scenes just for the sake of having violent scenes.
3,Better for domestic,"I think this book is more appropriate for domestic adoption. There were a few things that bothered me such as that ""usually"" adoptive parents know something about birth parents. Most people I know through adoption groups(international) know pretty close to nothing about the birth parents."
4,Great book for preparing our birth child for adoption,We have a 5 year old son and are planning to adopt a child through county DHR. We looked everywhere to find a book that explains adoption to our birth child. This one did the trick. It is written to the adopted child but we were able to use it with our birth child. It is full of facts instead of just being a sweet family story. It also points out that children don't have to look like the rest of the family.
3,Good info but too long and involved,"I liked the information this book has and it's a good conversation starter, but it's too long and detailed to keep their attention (5 and 7 year old) for very long. It's doesn't apply to all adoption situations so I have to kind of modify when I'm reading to make it fit us. (international and transracial)"
4,"Good video, bad spelling","Top left corner of the DVD case: ""Fun with DinAsaurus""So far, no misspellings in Russian on the first DVD, will have to see how's the rest."
4,Great way to start,"Have had some Whistlefritz DVDs for Spanish and I believe them to be of high quality. So I compare this set to the Whistle fritz DVDs. I would say so far, only getting through the 1st DVD, that these are pretty well made. There is a lot of repetition, which is great. In my opinion they spend money on visual effects. This does keep my 2 yrs olds attention pretty well.There does appear to be some randomness with skits in this, but I don't speak Russian."
4,A CLEAN SHAME,A very amusing collection of sex-related material that will have you both tapping your feet and laughing out loud: Recommended.
4,Super Soft,These are our favorite winter sheets. They are warm before you get in them and much softer than our other flannel sheets.
5,"soft,comfy ,affordable sheets",These sheets are great. They easily fit on a pillow- top mattress. One of the best things I ever bought for myself. I love them.
2,Comfy but way too much pilling!,"I love the color and I love how soft they are -- BUT I washed them first (always a good thing) and the FLUFF was amazing!!! There was already pilling -- bits of material fluff all over them...so I tried it again (by the way, I fluff dry with very low-heat and washed in cold water). Less fluff but still there. Its been a few weeks now and a few wash/dry cycles and every morning I wake up relaxed from the comfy warm sleep but finding bits of camel colored fluff in my hair on my jammies -- and on my cat! Not recommended. Ditto for the Duvet -- I only washed and dried it once and decided to NOT use it as a cover for my bed. I'm going to cut it in half and use it as batting for quilts. Ditto for the pillow covers."
2,junk,"you get what you pay for... $14.99 and free shipping..Do not expect much, because you won't get much..."
3,very soft sheets,"I really like these sheets. I was trying to find some flannel sheets that would look right in my room and these were a good fit. I have a new mattress so I needed ones that were deep enough to cover my mattress. I will say that they will shed alot in the wash a couple of times when you first wash them. I got pieces of the sheets all over me the first time that I put them on. They were on my pajamas when I woke up. I was trying to find some soft flannel sheets - they are very soft. I would recommend them, but I would also recommend you to wash them a few times before you put them on the bed."
5,Excellent All Around.,"Great service, quick delivery, the order was exactly as described, and the sheets are really the best flannel sheets I've owned. Thanks!"
4,Great bargain,These sheets are very soft even after being washed multiple times. They are also made to fit the larger mattresses with lots of room to spare. You don't have to struggle to get them on. I've really been happy with the quality of these sheets for this excellent price.
3,Warm but pill-y,"These sheets are warm and snuggly but pill a lot. Flannel is almost a necessity in the winter, but these sheets were kind of a pain. I keep using them to stay warm, though."
3,I like flannel. This product re-enforces that sentiment,This product meets all expectations. I would recommend consumers look into it. Very comfy!
5,"soft, thick, warm","Nice flannel sheets for the money. Soft, thick, warm. Just like flannels are supposed to be. Good value at $30. Only wish they had plaids."
5,good product - great price,These sheets were everything one would want them to be at a price that can't be beat.
3,Ehhh....,"Mediocre, these sheets are. They get worn pretty quickly. They definitely help keep you warm and the bed soft, so long as you put ALOT of fabric softener in the washing. However, that will lead to perhaps some itching and breakouts."
2,More pills than Walgreens,"Had to pre-wash these sheets twice because of the amount of lint shed, which isn't uncommon with flannel sheets, but these things seemed to lose half their volume in the lint filter. The pills that showed up after washing were ridiculous and made the sheets look as if they'd been used for years and feel rough to the touch.I bought two other sets at around the same time because the price was so low (expectations weren't really high, thankfully) and didn't even think about using them on the beds after the first set, but since they were on sale, I didn't throw away a bundle on them, and so decided to keep them, cut them into smaller pieces and use them as the inner layer of rag quilts, where the pilling won't be visible, anyway. For that use, I'd probably buy again if the price were low enough.On a positive note, the sheets didn't seem to shrink an unreasonable amount and would've fit the mattress fine had I been tough enough to sleep on them."
4,Flannel sheets,The cal king flannel sheets are great. It was wonderful finding a fitted flannel sheet that fit our mattress. They are very comfy and warm. The only thing that doesn't make then totally perfect is that they have lots of fuzz balls that come off onto the floor. But I know flannel sheets do that. I've only washed them twice so far. Maybe that will stop.OVERALL They are Great!!!
2,"Great price, low quality!",We anticipated receiving some great sheets at a great price. But what we got were shabby flannel sheets. After the FIRST wash they were all balled and rough - not soft at all - and we wake up with little fuzzies in our hair and all over our PJ's. We will not buy these again.
2,Couldn't resist the bargain but . . .,should've. I just recieved the sheets and washed them. The washer was full of wet fleece clumps. The dryer lint fliter became full and the sheets themselves have clumps on them.
4,Great Price!,"These are great sheets for the price. Nice and soft. I love them, wish I had ordered more."
4,"comfy, but not a great fit",the fitted sheet corner pockets are way too deep for my mattress. i have a standard beautyrest with a pillowtop. i am not sure what they used for the pattern??!!??but they are soft and comfortably smooth.
4,warm & cozy,"These sheets are as I expected them to be, very warm & cozy. They are thick and fit the mattress nicely. After washing them they do give off alot of lint but I expected that from flannel sheets. Would purchase another set if needed to but I'm sure these will last a while."
3,ok quality,"The quality of this item is not excellent, after a few washes it broke down! Would you expect much more for this price?"
4,Good Quality,"Good quality, beautiful garnet color and very warm. Will be giving one as a gift. Reasonably priced..you couldn't buy this kind of quality in a store. Woo-hoo...free shipping, too!"
2,You get what you pay for,"These are not luxury sheets by any stretch of the imagination. We have had multiple pairs of flannel sheets for a number of years. The ones we have had in the past were ""standard"" flannel sheets - not luxury. They were however, far superior to these. We have alternated between two sets on our King bed for years now and have not witnessed any piling. I don't believe we had as much dryer lint when they were new either (there is obviously none now). These sheets were also more expensive though.We have washed and dried these new sheets twice now (right out of the package) and the amount of dryer lint and sheet piling has been staggering.Would I buy these again for this price? - maybe, but I would not expect even standard flannel sheet performance. These are discount sheets at a discount price. Amazon should advertise them as such."
2,Flannel Sheets,"These really seemed to ""shed"" when I washed them the first time. I had to clean my lint trap in the dryer 3 times."
4,Very nice flannel sheets,I didn't expect much from these sheets at this really low price. They are only slightly less plush compared to a much more expensive set I bought last winter. They have held up very well after a couple of washings too. I don't think you will be disappointed in any regard.
4,Love these sheets!,I bought these sheets for the price....and was surprised that they are so comfortable. They have a few loose balls after the first washing...but hopefully there will be less after that. I would recommend these to others.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!,"I would have urge anyone reading this not to buy these unless you enjoy being covered in lint! The first time I washed them, it was like have of them had turned into lint balls that covered my house.HORRIBLE!!! I have other flannel sheets that do not this at all. I returned them immediately!"
3,Flannel Sheets,"I bought 2 pair of the cal-king sheets and was very pleased with their softness. They aren't as warm, as I would like them to be though and it takes a while for them to warm with body temperature. After changing them for the first washing, there were a lot of lint balls at the foot of the bed. I can only get one set of sheets in my washer at a time and when I took them out of the dryer, I noticed that they generated as much lint as my towels do, very wrinkled and they still had a few lint balls on them. When I placed the sheets on the bed, I was able to pull the rest of the few lint balls off easily and smooth the wrinkles out on the bed and they were still soft but I do not know if they will ball up, at the foot of the bed, again. I am not sure if I would purchase the sheets again."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I read many positive reviews on these sheets, so I decided to give them a try. They are indeed sheets. I am giving the company the benefit of the doubt and will accept the premise that they are flannel. As far as the quality goes, one wash and they already began to pill, as did the matching duvet cover. The pilling has increased with each washing. These are not sheets you would want to put out for guests--they look worn and somewhat skanky even when they are just out of the dryer. They feel somewhat stiff but not hair spray crispy--certainly not baby soft flannel. For the price, I probably shouldn't have expected much better. For $50, I have a duvet cover, pillowcases and one sheet set. I would not buy from this brand again, even with the low price for the set. Pretty crap overall."
2,Flannel sheets pill and shed,"I purchased these sheets because they were a good buy but not so cheap that they would be uncomfortable.But, I never figured they would pill so badly. When I first washed and dried them I had to empty the dryer lint filter twice on that load. But I thought all of the loose material would get out of them that way. No, they are still shedding so I cannot recommend them. They are soft though but the pills stick to your pajamas."
5,Mmmm.... Toasty,"I bought this for my special lady: when I asked her by email how they were (for this review), she practically jumped through the computer to give a big hug! She lives in WA (state), and nights can get awful cold up there-- but these sheets, et al keep her warm no matter what the temperature. Highly recommended! Buy a set while you still can!"
3,entertaining but inconsistent,"I thought the book was great, although, while I enjoy reading a good drama I enjoy reading about factual history as well. There were several examples in this book that so contradicted themselves it was fairly obvious to see where Scotti stretched the truth some. However I would still recommend this book to anyone who may take an interest in the our country's history of natural disasters."
4,Relevant to Hurricane Sandy,How many billions of tax dollars will we pour into rebuilding on the coast after Sandy? How many after Katrina?Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results - Albert Einstein
4,Compelling and thorough writing.,"Though not ""real life adventure writing"" in the same sense as Jon Krakauer or Sebastian Junger, Sudden Sea nevertheless takes the action packed storm of 1938 and constructs a similarly told story of science, adventure, and humanity in the face of powerful natural forces. What made this book even better was the tendency to avoid speculation and to present several sides of the same story to show how terrible and confusing the event was. There is ample attention given to geographic and meteorological detail."
3,good read,"It was an interesting read.If you have knowledge of the coastline of New England,it helps.Its amazing that a cat 5 hurricane hit New England with no notice and so many people survived."
4,The Terrific Tale Almost Tells Itself,"The Great Hurricane of 1938 was a wonderful choice for author R.A. Scotti to have selected as it would be hard not to have a successful tale to tell with a story of such inherent drama. The author does an admirable job in Sudden Sea of letting the story tell itself without getting too much in the way. The few small lapses (the thinly set context for this time and place is perhaps one misstep) are quickly erased as the hurricane barrels its way up the coast. The author wisely selects her scenes and the reader is captured by the tension of the life-and-death struggles of the survivors judiciously highlighted. This book is a little in the shadows next to a classic like Isaac's Storm but it still provides a great, late night of nail-biting (and very often quite moving) reading."
1,Color me football helmets craft kit.....makes 12,I want to know more about it before I buy....I dont know how big it is....need to know the size...
2,Horrible CD player,"Well, maybe I should give it two stars because of the four units I tested in Target this one definitely sounded the best. HOWEVER, the CD player is downright pathetic. It will not play any homemade CDs and I suspect it might have something to do with the company that built it (Sony is well known for their hyper-strident stance on copyright issues). So, we can't use any of our friend's productions (I have several musician friends who record their own music) and we can't play any of our own compilation CDs in it. Bummer. CDs that play in every other CD player we own but not in this one. In addition, older CDs have a tough time getting kick started. Newer ones (last 10 years or so I guess) are OK. So, if radio is all you want, this unit does sound OK. Just don't try to play anything besides mass produced CDs."
5,Great value for the price,I recently bought this Sony CD/Radio for my kitchen and found it very easy to fit because of the template and the adjustable spacers. The sound quality is surprisingly good for such small speakers and the bass enhancement helps.I live in Hollywood so there is a huge choice of radio stations. I downloaded a list of the stations/frequencies for each band and it was easy to program them in. The two FM bands gives scope for 10 stored FM stations.I also have another radio that can pick up weather band (in theory) but I couldn't get it to work on that radio or this unit. I'm assuming that I'm in a bad reception area.The TV sound works though not as clearly as the other bands. It's accademic really because TV's will soon go over to digital sound so it won't be able to pick them up then anyway!Yup... I'm happy with the unit!
3,"Nice Package, Mediocre Sound Quality","I was at a friend's house and he had Sony's previous model that this one replaced. Sounded terrific, though it was slightly larger. This new model looks sleeker and has a shallower profile. However, the so-called ""Mega-bass"" is a mega-disappointment. The difference between 'off' and the highest setting are almost imperceptible. Very disappointing. The other good features are great reception in my area and the handy weather and TV bands. I wish Henry Kloss designed an under-counter model before he passed on."
2,My CD player stopped working too,I see I'm not the only one with the CD problem. I have had my CD/radio for a little over a year now and the CD just stopped working. It is too bad because I love having the radio/cd (especially the cd) in the kitchen and it seems like Sony is the only one that makes them.
1,HORRIBLE reception. TINNY sound. Rosey reviews are wrong.,"Sorry guys, but I've evaluated this radio carefully now for months. And while you can move the powercord to improve reception, it is station specific, and a bulky powercord is just not something you should have to move around all the time, and worse: have hanging around your countertop. The entire POINT of this radio is to have it up and out of the way.Secondly, the ""mega bass"" is a joke. The sound (CD too) is horribly tinny. I have speakers of similar diameter which produce far more balanced sound. How dare Sony put out a product like this. If it hadn't been a gift given to me several months after purchase, I would have returned it instantly.1. Do not believe the rosey reviews. If you need a product like this, look elsewhere, or perhaps Sony's later models. This kills me because I am normally a sony fan, because their products are almost always predictably competent. Not this one.2. Repeatedly read #1 above as needed."
5,Amazing Kitchen Clock Radio,"This item is simply amazing. It is so slim and sleek and fits right under the cabinet. It was easy to install, has the CD option, which is great.. AND.. a remote. The Sony name, at this affordable price, who could ask for more? And at this very affordable price.. it makes a great gift too."
1,"Looks good, but avoid unless you want a paperweight","We went through 5 (yes, five) of these within a year. The CD mechanism was very poor and would eventually stop playing CDs. Luckily Target exchanged it every time for us. I kept exchanging it out of spite until Target got an updated model, the Sony ICF-CD553RM Under Cabinet Kitchen CD Clock Radio (Silver), which I paid 20 bucks more for and have not had a problem with it at all.Maybe it was just a bad run, but it seems from other reviews that Sony quality control was sleeping when these went out the door.Definitely spend the extra $ and find the upgraded Sony ICF-CD553RM - it's slightly bigger, but it works and the sound is better, too."
2,Christmas Gift,"I live in an urban area with generally good radio signals. The radio reception for this system is very poor. The AM antenna is internal and the power cord acts as the FM antenna. The reception is horrible. The unit does not accept an external antenna, so options are limited. All other features of the system work well but the radio is unusable."
2,Model defective and Sony service stinks,"For the four months we've owned this cd player, we've loved it. Love that it's off the counter. Love the remote on the fridge. Love the sound and ease of use. Then, the cd player just stopped working. When we contacted Sony we were informed that our only option was to mail it to their repair center at our cost and have a refurbished model sent back. Shipping set us back about $25 (not including the cost of packing materials). It doesn't speak well for Sony that they wouldn't send a UPS label to cover the cost of shipping, particularly on a product that broke with only a few months of standard usage. We are very, very disappointed."
1,Budget kitchen renovation for clear sound,"Like other reviewer's, the CD player stopped working after a couple of months of use. It took several months to get my unit fixed. It was very hard to deal with their uneducated customer service reps. Fortunately, it has been working since the repair.AM/FM reception is poor. Most stations are unpleasant to listen to due to the high level of noise. What Sony suggests for optimal reception is rotate the unit horizontally, stretch the power cord and reinstall the unit."
1,"CD-Failure, Very Disappointed",We bought this for our kitchen around Xmas 2003. We loved the idea of a compact unit for our kitchen and were excited to install it. Once done we tried to play a CD - nothing !!! We took it back for a replacement. Second one worked great and the system was exactly what we wanted.Forward on 11-12 months...........the CD again has stopped working. We no longer have the receipt and plan to buy a non-Sony system (once we can find one !!).We had a home mini-stereo that went the same way. My advice - Sony are good for TV's and Video camera's. Any other appliance - buy a different manufacturer.
1,Another One Bites It,"Like others, mine stopped working after just over 12 months of light use. The replacement cost is more than a new one on certain on line stores. It is a piece of crap."
4,Wished for more AM/FM station presets,Nice design with easy installation. I only wished that it had more than 5 AM/FM station presets.
2,No aux jack,"This has been a workhorse in our kitchen, but as soon as I started using an iPod, it became almost useless. No aux cable outlet on it. And I'm pretty sure I paid about $100 for this 5 years ago, and not the outrageous price listed here (over $1000? huh?). Must be a typo. The sound quality is ok for what it is. Will upgrade to a new one with the aux cable soon."
3,"Very good, but one problem",This radio really filled the bill in our kitchen. Easy to install and good sound.But after about a year the buttons are starting to fail. They just quit working one by one. We use the remote to change stations or volume now. If not for this I would have given 5 stars. We will probably look for a different brand next time.
1,Loved it- until it stopped working,"We purchased this radio, loved the tv feature and used it a moderate amount. Then the volume button broke and would constantly turn down the volume rendering it useless. I very much want another one but am nervous about purchasing the ""new improved version"""
5,great Kitchen CD Clock Radio,"This CD Clock Radio has been a very nice addition to our kitchen. It plays clearly and has sufficient volume for every setting. It is great to have it out of the way, but very accessible."
2,nice cd player / bad radio reception,"Just bought and will now be returning this item. Cd sound is good but it can't get high powered radio stations clearly. It seems these units not only fail after a year as in the other reviews, but they cheaped out on the antenna/tuners when they made them. I get better reception on a 20 year old clock radio I have at home."
1,Practically Unusable,"It looks like I'm not the only one who had a problem. My CD player also stopped working after a couple of months. In addition, the radio ""fuzzed out"" most of the time. I'd steer clear of this brand. I discarded mine within the first year."
5,Great sound and excellent quality,"I bought this Sony kitchen CD player/radio for my husband as a Christmas gift, and we both love it. Not only was it incredibly easy to install, but it's just the right size and fits perfectly under our cabinets. I hardly ever listen to the radio, so I really can't comment on the FM/AM reception quality, although it seemed to work just fine when we tested everything to make sure it worked. The unit was easy to program and the CD player works great. I was pretty amazed by the sound quality, which is very good. The bass is also very impressive, and the volume can be turned up very loud so we can enjoy music throughout the main floor of our house. The remote control is also very handy, and it even has a magnet on the back so we can stick it on the refrigerator without worrying that it might get lost. All in all, this radio is excellent, and it's a great value for the price."
2,CD does not work,"We have had the radio/cd player for about 8 months, we use the CD maybe two to three times a week. We wanted to get in the Christmas spirit and play Christmas Carols, nothing came out of the CD player. I should think a CD player would last more than 8 months. Very unhappy about the quality of the CD player."
4,"big capacity and fast download speed, but pricey","Great storage capacity! 256MBytes is big enough to store up all the pictures I can shoot on trips away from home. For example, I can hold hundreds of shots taken at high resolution on my Fuji Finepix 3800 camera (200 shots taken at 3 MPixel resolution, or 640 shots taken at a still respectable 2 MPixel resolution). Pictures download rapidly from this card to my pc, much faster than from a smartmedia card I used in a previous camera. And of course xD cards are so much more compact than smartmedia cards.On the downside, these xD card are so pricey! For example, Amazon sells 128 MBytes of card memory for about $60 in xD format, and just $35 in smartmedia format. So card format is definitely something to consider if you're still deciding on which digital camera to buy."
1,Worked great -- for a month,"The FujiFilm cameras seem like an exceptional value with excellent features, but how reliable is the xD card storage medium? I purchased the 256 MB card and it worked just a few weeks before it began to malfunction. When it was inserted into the Alladin kiosks, now at many stores, it had to be reinserted again and again. Then when the pics are printed they are too dark. Apparently one of the metalic contacts has become damaged. Upon close examination it appears far to easy for this to happen. Given the many removals and insertions that may be required using the xD card it seems less well constructed than rival cards. Sadly, this also impacts the usability of the camera. When I contact Fuji, I find a knee-deep phone menu with plenty of deadends, and the customary ""due to unusual call volume ...."" message. I've received no response to the email or voicemail messages I've left. I'd be less likely to buy a FujiFilm digital product after this experience."
1,Would NOT recommend,"We have owned our camera for less than 1 month and already on our second Fujifilm xD-picture card (256mb). After taking an evening of pictures - we found out the card was defective. All pictures were lost. We had to purchase a 2nd card and after taking a week of pictures on vacation - this card is also defective. All pictures lost. Apparently there is a way to retrieve the pictures, but is a VERY expensive process. Iwould not recommend this product at all - very disappointed!"
1,"works fine, but has compatibility issues...","I am using this XD picture card in my new Fuji Finepix camera and it is working fine. I also have a Olympus camera that also uses XD picture cards. I bought the USB reader/writer for my Olympus camera, it attaches to my computer and all you have to do is pop in the card and not have to deal with the camera hook-ups and all that mess. So I figured since it was a reader/writer for XD picture cards that it would work with every ""XD"" picture card. I was wrong, it only works with ""Olympus"" XD picture cards and not Fuji. Even though the cards look exactly the same except one says Fuji and the other says Olympus. Can't they make a universal card so there wont be so many extra things you have to buy for everything!? I had to bite the bullet on this and I now manually connect my camera to the computer to download pictures. This annoyed me a lot so I gave it one star, otherwise the card works perfectly."
1,I got a spatula instead of the picture card I ordered!!!!!!,i cannot believe that whoever packed my order.gave me a kitchen spatula instead of a picture card!
1,Cheated.,"This item was sent used - instead of new, as requested - without any packaging, from a person who simply sold it out of his pocket.Amazon's reply to my complaint was to give me the runaround."
1,Hopefully a Mistake?!?!,"I ordered this item just prior to leaving for a month in Colorado. (actually I did not mean to order it but made one too many ""clicks"") I did not receive it until we returned in early September, just prior to Hurricane Ike - which knocked out our power for over a week. But, the bottom line is that I recieved a 16 MB xD picture card instead of the 256 MB that I ordered!! I can only hope that was a mistake on the seller's part and not an intentional rip-off!"
4,256 mb xd card,"Good price, quick delivery, works great. I have doubts that it was actually new but it works and that's what matters to me!"
1,Does not work in FujiFilm F700 cameras,"The Amazon product description omitted that this was a Type M card. As a result, it would not work in my FujiFilm F700 camera."
1,"Poor product, bad since purchase and no customer service","This product is not recomendable in no way, there is no way to return it without aditional charges. It's bad to begin with. Sent back since DEC and there is no way to track it!!! I could bet on the 30 day return is going to pop up. If a policy such as this exists, this product should no be part of amazon's list, it only creates insatisfied customers for ""penny"" cash."
5,Great practical gift!,"My boyfriend had recently bought a digital camera and he only had the memory card that it came with. It held very few pictures, so he was delighted when I gave him this memory card as a gift. It was easy to use and holds many pictures."
5,Loved it!,"Great characters with depth and complexity! Tense, mysterious, involving plot! Riveting action! Give me more like this..."
4,Use in 2013 still useful,"Yana's depiction of those in the trades still works and should not be over looked. As a career coach I still turn to her work for construction, service industries resume samples for those I train on seeking employment."
5,FAB BOOK! - Great Resource!,Very comprehensive & gives great examples of all kinds of job situations & resumes to meet unusual needs.Wonderful book!
2,"old edition is, well, out of date","I purchased this through Amazon marketplace and was sent a much older edition than I expected. It was from 1996. And a resume from 1996 is as dated as a PC from 1996 would be. Yeah, it served its need well back then, but it's a dinosaur now."
2,200 not so good examples,I was very disapointed in this resume guide. Not fresh or powerful and not much worth using here.
5,Excellent!,I used it to update my resume and now my resume is 10 times better than before! One of the many things that it includes is a list of tough problems that you might come across. This list tells you where to find the specific example resumes to illustrate solutions to each problem.
4,Almost Perfect,"I really love how the book has layouts for even the oddest job and for people who have experience, but as a recent grad from college and not having a whole lot of experience in the workforce, I found it to be not as helpful as I'd had hoped it to be."
1,An excellent example of non-science and quackery,"Hoagland's presentation in this video masquerades as a serious scientific seminar on the ""Mars anomaly"", but it isn't long before it becomes apparent that Hoagland has no concept of standards of proof, logic, or of the scientific method. Tenuous assumptions are taken as fundamental truths upon which even more outlandish theories are proposed. If you do watch it, don't be put off when it starts to get boring. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with shots of people leaving the auditorium around the time that Hoagland tries to tie Mars, crop circles, the pyramids, and ancient Mayan temples to a massive NASA conspiracy that's keeping the truth from us. Uh-huh. After the show is over, you'll be left feeling slightly embaressed for this man takes himself very seriously, but whose theories are more at home in a bad X-Files episode or an L Ron Hubbard space opera pulper."
3,Nice idea,"Nice looking watch, with features as advertised. Voice is mechanical, but that's fine. The watch was heavier than I anticipated and rooster alarm crowing at 2:00 a.m. because the alarm on button was inadvertantly pushed is rather startling!"
5,Great book!,This book is a good read. It gives you the story behind the hymn. It is a wonderful tool to get your family worshiping together. I will treasure this book and use it for years to come!
4,Fascinating,"Love having the stories and the music together. Paperback format is inconvenient to actually play the songs, but not insurmountable"
5,Then Sings My Soul: 150 of the World's Greatest Hymn Stories,I love this book!!! Learning the origin and history with each song brings a clearer understanding and a sense of brotherhood with these saints of yesterday.
5,The entire process was great and so very easy.,This book has information that I never thought to question. It adds to the singing of these hymns in ways that just are hard to explain. I never thought of the authors and what enspired them until reading this book.
5,Then Sings My Soul,"Oh, my; what a fun book to look through. It gives you wonderful insight on hymns we have sung all of our life."
5,I love the hymns!,"It is a wonderful experience to read of each & every one of the basis for the writing of the hymn, definitely inspiration from God himself!"
5,A Singing Devotion Book,Great old songs that our generation still love. We read the story and sing the song together. It brings back wonderful memories and gives us amazing information about the inspirational author.
5,Lovely hymn study book,"If your goal is to learn hymns and would also enjoy knowing the history behind them this book will be a welcome edition in your library. It is very interesting to read, I am enjoying sharing what I learn with others including my children."
3,Close but the format got in the way,"Then Sings My Soul is organized in chronological order from 820 ad to a hymn from the author dated 2002. The book is printed in a forced format with the music on the left and the story on the right. This format has two unfortunate consequences. First the text has to fit only on the facing page. This leads to very short stories that can lack in character development. Also, in at least one case this format artificially truncated the music. The chorus to ""When the Roll is Called Up Yonder"" is missing since the additional music apparently would have carried over to the next page. Since I was looking to arrange this particular hymn, not having all the music was a disappointing shortcoming.Overall this is an agreeable book covering many important hymns and with a brief on the music or text. However, in my opinion, the hymn stories series from Kenneth Osbeck is a far better reference in depth and detail."
5,Nicely Put Together,This is a lovely collection of hymns with a small history of the song and songwriter. It also comes with the music notes for playing as well. Great addition to any library!
5,"Songs for the Heart, Mind and Soul","""Then Sings My Soul"" is a unique presentation which offers a historical synopsis of many of the most popular hymns of all time. It is a book you can read cover to cover or just pick up and open any page and be captivated. This would make a wonderful gift for anyone who loves the music,poetry and spirituality of these well know hymns."
1,Totally misleading description..,"The book I received was not what I was expecting. The description posted on Amazon was very misleading; I thought I was getting (The meaning of God's names). For example, El Shaddai, the Satisfier, the God of sufficiency, Nakkeh Lo Yenakkeh, a righteous Judge, Jehovah-Jireh etc.The book I received was completely different.Next time, I don't think I would order a book on Amazon because it’s better to flip through what you are paying for before purchasing.Josie."
1,not for kids!!,The thought never crossed my mind that a book on ancient Greek would be too inappropriate to give as a gift. The book has many illustrations which range from innuendo-laden to pornographic. NOT a good choice for younger audiences!
4,A relatively fun book to read...,"I am enjoying reading this book, but it is not anywhere close to my first language book, or even my first Greek book. I enjoy the humor and information in the book, but I'm not sure first time language folks would grasp it too good.There was one disappointment. I'm not generally too uptight about this sort of thing, but in the very first chapter, there is a cartoon with a naked lady in it, and I have no clue what the purpose was of the cartoon or what the purpose of her being naked was, I only know it heavily reminded me of the cartoons I saw in Playboy in my younger days, which I found slightly offensive, especially because I was reading it on the bike in the gym with people all around. Maybe its just me, thought I'd throw that out there."
5,"Peter Jones' ""Learn..."" books: excellent beginner value!","If you're self-learning a language, and finding standard textbooks to be drier than toast, give Peter Jones' ""Learn ___: A Lively Introduction to Reading the Language"" books a try! I have his book for Latin, and it enabled me to get over the initial learning curve and see that I would be able to learn this language after all. So, when I saw that he had another book for Ancient Greek, I snagged it as quickly as possible! These books began as a popular series of newspaper columns in the UK, and were subsequently published as books due to popular demand."
4,About time,"It's about time this little gem was released on DVD. It was nominated for 6 Golden Globes and 2 Oscars. It won the Golden Globe for Best Comedy. Set during WWII when Italy surrenders to the Allies. Anthony Quinn plays Bombolini. He becomes the town mayor and has to devise a plan to save the town's million bottles of wine from the now occupying Germans. Hardy Kruger does an excellent job as the German officer trying to take the wine.My favorite scene is when Bombolini finds out that Fabio, the local hunk, was making love to his daughter, Angela. He says, ""I'm going to punish that boy so that he remembers it for the rest of his life."" In the next scene we see Fabio and Angela leaving the church as a newly married couple.See the other comments for the VHS version of this film.The Secret of Santa Vittoria"
4,Hidden Treasure,"This is a must see movie that is a true Anthony Quinn classic. And all the actors are great in this movie that is both hilarious and dramatic since it takes place during the Second World War. I, and many of my friends and family, would love to see this movie come on DVD. I could see this movie over and over again and never get tired of it."
4,Mighty Quinn,"I had watched this film when it was released a good 30+ years ago, and Antony Quinn, one of my favorite actors even now, just stole my heart with his performance. I personally think this is one of the great performances (amongst many) by him."
4,Hide the Wine!,"THE SECRET OF SANTA VITTORIA (1969) is a long, but utterly charming WW2 comedy about a small Italian village and its attempt to hide its ""pride,"" a million bottles of precious wine, from the Nazis.Stanley Kramer directed this handsome adaptation of Robert Crichton's novel, which stars Anthony Quinn as the town's drunken ""clown,"" who inexpiably becomes the mayor and chief mastermind in the plot to deceive the German troops. They are led by the honorable, but duty-bound, Hardy Kruger.Also in the fine cast are Anna Magnani as Quinn's wife who initially can't stand the man, yet develops a new respect for him as he deals with the enemy, Virna Lisi as the daughter of the village's once aristocratic family, Sergio Franchi as the peasant soldier that she falls for and Giancarlo Giannini, playing a young villager in love with Quinn and Magnani's daughter.Michael B. Druxman"
1,A Good Maps & Charts Book - I'm Still Looking,"I was looking for a series of charts that would combine people and historical dates. For example, in Daniel, how do the various prophets line up with the various rulers? When do Daniel's dreams take place chronologically?This book didn't come close. This book has outlines of each of the books. I can get that in almost any commentary. This book gave cursory discriptions and discussion about each Bible book. But, the authors did not provide enough detail to make the reading worthwhile. That level of detail made reading a waste of time.This book is supposed to be a ""Complete Book of Bible Charts and Maps!"" It's NOT. Even the drawings of things like to ark of the covenant are small, roughly drawn and basically unuseable.I was VERY disappointed with this book."
5,Great aid for any bible study,"For someone who learns best from short lists, organized thoughts, tables, flow charts, visual aids, this book is great! It breaks each book in the bible into a time line, main ideas or concepts, diagrams of travel routes, compares first and seconds appearences (or before and after ideas) of the same concept. (ex: Compares Paul's first and second voyage, compares Adam to Jesus) It's a wonderful tool for learning."
3,COMPLETE BOOK OF BIBLE MAPS AND CHARTS,Adequate for my needs--often more information than I need for the class I am taking.
3,Mainly for guidelines,This book is mainly for guidelines of the books inside the Bible. Not much charts or maps as I was originally seeking.
1,Had to send it back - no maps!,"I purchased this item for my Kindle Fire, but after it downloaded, I had no maps! The only maps included were so small (and not re-sizable)that I couldn't read them. I'm not looking for a commentary, just an atlas. This isn't it."
2,Not my favorite,This book is hard to navigate. Maybe I need a someone to show me how to navigate. I'd love to be able to use it easily.
2,Not enough actual maps,"This book has lots of information in condensed forms about authors, historical context, but very few actual maps. I was very disappointed, I think the title of the book is very misleading. If you want concise information at your finger tips about each book of the bible; this might be just fine. . . looking for maps of the areas in question. . . prepare to be disappointed."
5,Nelsons complete book of bible charts and maps,Excellent for learning about the bible.All the important information on each book of the bible. Not any needless information.Gives short overviews of each book with some maps and charts when necessary.
4,forensic buff,This CD is enjoyable and easy. You do have to keep the CD in CD drive in order to play.
1,wrong fit,"i have a 64 bit Gateway CPU. It is fast, it does all kinds of tricks, but it is totally unable to run many games because they were not built for the newer machines. I love word games, but this one fails."
3,Games,Was not what I was expecting. It is not the same games that you show and display. Very disappointed. Some of the games thati received are fun but most of them are not what was reported on your display.
1,Annie's review,"Would not open up right on my laptop! What a disappointment! The games were not very challenging and my husband doesn't even play them. It was a gift, not a good one"
1,Unable to use,"I was not told that these two games, Galaxy of Word Games, and Word Mania were not going to work on my Windows 7, 64 bit laptop! I am very upset because i usually have good experiences with Amazon.com. Please send me a refund or send me the new version of both of these games that I can use!Thank youMichelle Griffone"
5,Great Presentation of Human Anatomy,"I have looked high and low for a book that explains the anatomy and function of the human body in a technical way that is neither too basic nor complicated for a general reader like me who also needs to explain it to inquisitive children, and this is the book that really got everybody's attention in the family. It explains all the systems of the human body :1 Cells, skin and epithelium2 Skeletal System3 The Muscular System4 The Nervous System5 The endocrine System6 Cardiovascular System7 The Immune System8 The Respiratory System9 The Digestive System10 The Urinary System11 The Reproductive System12 The Human Life Cyclealong with some disorders and modern medical treatment related to each system. The illustrations are very clear, impressive and greatly detailed; The information is up to date."
2,Great book- very poor kindle version,The actual written contents if this book is excellent. In fact one of the best stories about smith wiggles worth ever written.BUT the whole book is ruined by a really poor transfer to kindle which spoils it.Here are the issues.1. Table of contents is there but does not link to the chapters. In other words it is a list of static text.2. The first letter of some words appears separate above the rest of the word.3. The actual photographs are missing that the paper book includes.4. The front cover is missing so we don't see the nice artwork the paper book has.If it wasn't for being a big fan of Mr Wigglesworth I would have sent this back.
5,Bought for each of my kids,I bought five copies a few years ago so each of my children would have their own copy for when they grew up and needed a great book to read their kids. It was out of print but Amazon found five and they all came as used but in very good condition.
1,Historical accuracy? Ha!,"There is little historical research in Cassie's books, aside from what might be found in an old Cowboys and Indians show from the 1950s where all the Indians were noble, all the whites were bad (except for the heroine, OF COURSE) and everyone understood everyone perfectly. Either all the whites speak the (insert tribe name here) language or the Indians speak perfect English.The love scenes are laughable, there is no plot and the characters are barely two-dimensional."
2,Doesn't live up to expectations,I bought this book based on other reviews. But was disappointed. It is a thin paperback with big type. The authors have done a cruise from Southern California to Baja and just don't have enough expierence for the ambitious title. They made plenty of mistakes in their cruise and are honest enough to admit it. But due to lake of experience there insights on the right way to do things are limited. Would I buy again? NO.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased the book based on the review in Latitudes, and found I had to push myself to read more than 5 min. at a time. Large print, and very little substance. Very nice couple though, I met them at one of there seminars in San Diego. Better luck with the next book."
1,Not particularly informative or entertaining,"Basically this book was a dissapointment. Written by a well meaning but hapless couple who seem more interested in putting down stakes in a live-aboard community than cruising. I knew going in that there would be scant information on the technical aspects of sailing and cruising but I was at least hoping for some enlightenment on on-board living. It is replete with lame advice like 'try to shop around for the best fuel prices' and other obvious tidbits. The live-aboard etiquette section was quite interesting although the description of the lifestyle seemed more like squatters than cruisers. If your goal is to get on a boat and go places and do things, this book is not your cup of tea."
2,If you are going to read 50 books on cruising...,"...then make this one of them. I think I've read that many, and my attitude is that if I can get ONE good idea from a book, then it's money well spent. The one good idea I got: that the most important thing to care for on a boat is the relationship between those who sail her. I read this entire book in about three hours, and it was three enjoyable hours. On the other hand, it only scratches the surface when it comes to describing the basics of cruising, let alone doing it comprehensively as one might expect from the title. For those of you who see the blurb on the back from the editor of Latitudes & Attitudes, don't let that scare you off. These authors seem to be people who respect other cruisers and the traditions of the sea. There is no sense of the ""biker"" mentality. Those people contemplating cruising should read everything they can. Once you've finished Pardey, Roth, Marchaj, Cornell, Rousmaniere and Toss, pick this up as well."
3,Fair to midlands,I think the book is overpriced for the large print in all 192 pages. It has some great ideas for those that have never moved into new situations. The first half of the book and a good part of the rest seems talk about dealing with stress. If stress is the main issue of cruising then this is the book.
3,Practical co-cruising advice from the heart.,"I found this book both charming and frustrating. The authors generously share both their love of cruising and what they've learned from doing it. But as writers they often use 3 metaphors when 1 would do and pad their sentences with too many adjectives and verbal cliches. The effect on me, the reader, is that instead of being drawn deeper into the wonderful experiences they are sharing I feel pushed away by all the verbal noise. But there is lots of good advice in this book for couples on how to be clear about each other's cruising expectations. And low income dreamers will find plenty of useful tips on how to buy a boat on a budget."
4,Fascinating!,"An exciting, action-packed page-turner about a relationship with a very controlling and powerful political figure which quickly escalates out-of-control! Although Jo is a strong, determined and independant woman, she cannot shake off the dangerously obsessive man who refuses to take ""no"" for an answer. It was highly captivating and thrilling to read how this situation would eventually play out. The military setting adds an unusual and interesting balance to the romance, and the helicoptor missions inject enthralling adventure into the story."
4,Another excellent adventure from Merline Lovelace,"This tale continues the story of Jo West, the helicopter pilot who saved Carly Samuels and Ryan McMann in a previous book (I can't remember the title). Unlike some of the other reviews, I thought this was an fascinating story because the ""knight in shining armor"" is NOT. Jo stays in character as a ""I can take care of myself in a male-dominated occupation."" She even acknowledges that you have to play by the unspoken rules (as she observes in the pilot ready room) to get ahead. I only wish that the book had another chapter. Was Deke able to recover and return to active duty? What else motivated Alex to be the way he was?"
3,Good overall story but....,I don't understand why the author doesn't put more effort in developing a good ending. I felt cheated and wanted more.
2,Dissapointing,"I was very excited about reading this book. I have been looking for books with suspense and romance combined and I hoped that this one would be better than it was. First, I didn't like how most of the story was told from Jo's point of view. I like books where there are the main characters and sometimes the pov from the secondary characters as well. I felt that the story would have been better if the reader would have understood where Alex was coming from. At the beginning of the book he seemed like a sweet and caring guy, if a little intense. That's what most readers like in a hero though, and at first you got intense with Alex. Then he got creepy. Not creepy enough in my opinion. At the end of the book I still wished that someone could have helped Alex.I really wouldn't recommend this book. It was a fast read, but again, it was very dissapointing."
2,Simply nothing,"Definitely is not the best book, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget the story.In the middle of the book, if not before, you know that Alex is the bad guy, why can't see this Jo if she is one of the bests pilots of the USAF?I can give other examples but I will tell you the story of this book (that I don't recommend at all.)The worst part of the book is that you will not take anything if you read it, no lessons, no messages, no nothing."
3,Long term pond goldfish feeder,"This product is very good for feeding your pond fish. In a 100 gallon + pond the disolved plaster doesn't really make a big difference. The block will feed 8 medium sized goldfish, koi, for about 5 - 10 days. The price for the blocks was best I could find, but was disappointed in the cost of the shipping for product. I will look at shipping cost for this product before purchasing online again. The product is hard to find at this price in pet stores locally."
1,Useless,I put two of these in my pond with a large population of goldfish and a month later when I was doing some cleaning I found both of them on the bottom unchanged!
1,Give me a break....,"I love how everyone assumes that when they write a review they just HAVE to give it 5 stars... I mean, I'm just trying to figure out if I'm the only one who actually read the book. I'm not sure. What I AM sure of is that if you're someone looking to find out what karma is all about from an eastern perspective, SAVE YOUR MONEY. This book is like Billy Graham trying to get all new-age on us. Believe me,I'm the first person to jump up and tell everyone I know when a book is good... And uh, well...I'm just kinda sitting here right now."
4,onyx chess set,Product arrived as promised in excellent condition. Nicely done and we have it where all of our guests can see it.
2,Hard to judge.,"It may be a good product, but I can't tell because at the sound of the spray pump my cat heads for the hills."
5,esoteric classic,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this classic work of theosophy, anthropology, hypnotism, mediumship, psychology and occultism...so let me make a few brief notes...A learned 19th century work of european witchcraft, shamanism. spiritism and occultism...it belongs in the library of every serious student...the core of the book is chapter xi on gypsy witchcraft where the author enters fully into a discussion of the ""trance state"" and the methodologies used by european ""folk doctors"" etc...for entering the ""other world""...so to speak...leland studied under those who knew and practiced the ""old faith"" and he combines this with the erudition of a fine scholar...very valuable resource...and a great read !"
1,"""Gypsy"" Sorcery? Are you serious?!","This is one of those books that should go over to the fiction section as quickly as possible as it's little more than a make believe; a 'history' of Lelands concepts of Gypsy ritual and society.This book does little to clarify the complexity of Gypsy (Romani, Sinti, Kalderash, etc...) society and culture, but rather plays up to an age old exoticism of and futher alienation of this group of people from society, and society from them.Leland's ""Gypsy Lore Society"" was pretty much a group of middle to upper class white men (and women) who spent their days (mis)appropriating a culture they could barely understand. It's time this was debunked and demystified.If you want a book of fanciful 'sorcery' and imagery, then sure, get a copy of this book, if you want to understand Gypsies and Travellers, don't look here."
2,"good range, terrible keyboard",I returned this after a week because I couldn't stand typing on it. I thought it would be a great all in one solution for a media PC I built.The keys feel terrible and the mouse action is SO PAINFULLY SLOW as to be completely worthless.I shopped long and hard for this but returned it. I bought a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse instead which does the job much better and actually goes the rated 30 feet from my PC.
1,Beware of Upgrading your computer,"I had an old version of Timeslips running on a Windows box. I bought a new computer. I cannot transfer the program to the new one. Sage says they no longer supports the old program. They want me to buy a new program for almost $500.00. I don't need the new program. I am perfectly happy with the old one. I paid for the license to run it on one computer. That's all I want to do. (Actually, I don't think support knows how to move the old program to a new computer.) These people are not really interested in the small firm or single user.There are other billing programs out there. Use one of them. Better still, switch to a MAC."
4,"Classic, solid Jazz","I am really glad to have found this CD, unwrapped and in great shape. Great sound, 3 particularly great songs and a fine purchase."
4,Get up to 'speed' on the superb acting of Scott Caan,"I've been a huge admirer of Scott Caan ever since I first saw him on the big screen. The son of the great James Caan, his pedigree may well be taken care of, but he still had a lot to therein live up to. And he did so in an amazing list of acting jobs that include 'Gone In 60 Seconds,' `Novocaine,' `Varsity Blues' and even the cheesy 'American Outlaws' and 'Ready To Rumble'. In 'Speed of Life' Caan is the central character that takes care of his `fast-fading' father in much the same way a new mother would take care of her newborn. Finally pushed to levels he never realized he could feel, Drew (Caan) turns to drugs to relax, but ends up losing his job, his common sense and finally his judgement. That all said, it's Leo Burmester's ('The Abyss,' `The Neon Bible') role as Caan's relapsed father that steals the show and the heart strings well before the tortured end."
3,Good first try,THis is one of Scott Caan's earlier movies and I found it to be true to life regaring the portrayl of a young man caring for his terminally ill Father and the trials and tribulations that come with it.
2,Sewell fan,The series is formulaic and not very compelling. I adore Rufus Sewell and that's why I bought it. Don't recommend unless you are a Sewell fan.
2,Not all that hot ---,"This was described as a cutting edge sort of CSI --- with paranormal and scientific cutting edge themes --- the opposite is the truth --- I watched one disc and put it into my ""stupid"" pile... It is not even comparable to CSI --- I thought, from the way the description of this show was given, that it would be something akin to The Fringe --- which I think is really great. But this show is very adequate only --- if you have to watch something, you can stick this into your player and take a nap..."
5,Check out the other reviews,Search for the product under its correct title - Eleventh Hour - and find at least 18 more 5-star reviews on a separate page. Hopefully someone at Amazon will pick up on this and merge the listings.
1,ridiculous,I downloaded this from Google Books -- this is in the public domain so that price is simply outrageous!
3,"Easy, but ugly","You can easily follow the instructions, but what you get at the end of the (short) road is an ugly product! You can make beautiful origami just by googling. There are many good sites. Honestly, I still regret to buy this book!"
5,Impress your children!,A great book for rainy days and to entertain the young and the young at heart. A wonderful Oragami starter book. The Frog is my favorite!
2,Ben Harper: Narcissism and self-worship,"This video is a great snapshot into the mind of a narcissist. I like Bens music, but some of the footage he really comes off as condescending, overbearing, rude and unpleasant. Be sure to watch for dramatic pauses as he waxes philosophically, being sure to give us commoners a clue he is going to blow our minds with his knowledge. Also watch as he shows what a diva he is during interviews- you better not ask him a stupid question, or you shall face the wrath of Ben!!!To summarize, this is a pretty good showcase of his music, but I left watching this losing all respect for the guy."
1,Its NOT Closed Captoned,"Yes this is plenty reason to flunk this dvd. I have dvd's 10 years old that have CC.As you hit the ""not helpfull"" button, understand, that it was not long ago someone like Ben would not even be able to play the places he does now, because he is black.If you dont think both of these are the same issues, your ignorant. Not stupid, ignorant."
5,You don't have to be in the medical field to enjoy this book,I laughed myself silly and then cryed with the Jones family. I think that life is sometimes stranger than fiction. I found it spellbinding. I think that Mike's ability to land on his feet at times when it seemed impossible to do so was remarkable. I would recommend for anyone (not just those in the medical field) to read as a comment how one person can overcome discouraging circumstances.
2,"Well written, but quite a downer...","I've been a physician assistant for 13 years and was excited to read what turned out to be a well written, but very depressing account of my profession. I disagree with reviewers who think that the author's experiences are typical of physician assistants. If I would've had as many bad experiences in medicine as this guy did, I would've found another line of work."
4,Very interesting!,"I found this book to keep my interest and to be very enjoyable to read. As a future PA I found the book sort of upsetting and could possibly turn many people off to the PA career path. I also found many of the author's actions to be very odd and did not agree with most of his religous/family/career choices. Even so, I really liked the book and would highly recommend it."
4,A complete narrative,"Although I am not usually a fan of science fiction, I found this book to be as detailed and fast-paced as Dan Brown's DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons. The strength lies in the completeness of the world that Stark has created with its numerous characters and descriptive settings. It was also thought-provoking in its comments on organized religion, humankind's need to believe, and the quest for power by those who control the delivery of the myth to the masses."
5,Pep Torres' best cd yet!,"Even though I'm not a Chicano, I love this cd and even more then his English cd You & I. This cd is more energetic then his other one, more uptempo and exciting. Honking saxaphones blarring on some track and sparse trio on others, but it's all GREAT! You don't have to speak Spainish to enjoy the ultra-cool cd. Hey I play this in my 49 Mercury at car shows and I'm a hit with all the hommes, and have made a lot of new friends from this cd. There is something really cool about rockabilly being sung in espanol! Awsome, cd. not only one of Pep's best but just one of the best rockablly cd's of the 90's! Hey we're lucky us OC locals we got Pep over in Fullerton and Big Sandy over in Anaheim. OC rocks with rockabilly greats!"
2,"Smells like Ginger, but doesn't work like Ginger","For digestion issues, I take Ginger because it has worked very well at alleviating my problem. I have been taking these pills for about a month now and even though I prefer not to, I am switching back to Nature's Way Ginger caps because these pills just don't work as good. I wanted to use these because they are vegetarian capsules and I don't like the fact that the Nature's Way is made from a Gelatin capsule; however, they work really good. I am very disappointed in this product. I gave it two stars, because it does indeed smell like Ginger, but for some reason it just doesn't work like Nature Way's Ginge caps. I guess I will switch back over until I find me another vegetarian Ginger cap. I just hope I can find some that work as well"
3,(certain kind of) mood music,"I like that this disc sounds fairly far removed from a SD record. The vibe is funky and esoteric. Probably not everyone's cup of tea. There are times when I just love to hear this music. I think I can listen to the song 'Surf and/or Die' endlessly. Something about that one is just downright hypnotic. Love those stratlike clean, delayed, ringing two or three note guitar chords playing thruout."
5,"Cool,Reserved, and very tasteful !!","You know how Billy Gibbon's voice fits perfectly with ZZ Top's music?? You wouldn't want a CD of Billy singing Christmas carols...right??? Same with Walter. At first listen his voice seems a little weak, but then you realize that no other voice would do this CD justice.I love this CD. There is a refreshing humor present, very unusual and tasty chord progressions, and very revealing and honest lyrics about the man's moods and experiences. Get this CD and listen to ""Hat Too Flat"" for a coupla days and it will become an alltime fave. If you've ever spent night after night sifting thru rerun after rerun on TV... just trying to sort things out...then you need to listen to ""Girlfriend."" And if you've ever been forced to take an honest look at your selfish tendencies concerning an intimate relationship with a special woman, then you can connect with ""This Moody Bastard.""This is a very unique CD in all aspects....and it is absolutely brilliant...........and fun!!!!!!"
4,A revelation-not really,I should have known this was going to be as good as it is-how did I miss the original release? Becker minus Fagen still cuts the mustard. Try it buy it-you will not be disappointed-it creeps up on you like all great albums.
2,Stick to The Dan Walter,"Now we know why Walter doesn't do any vocals on Steely Dan albums! Walter has many talents as a musician , lyricist and evrrything else that make Steely Dan so great - but his singing is woeful! That's not to say that some of the tracks aren't catchy. The songs are basically good - they just cry out for a good singer to deliver them. Book of Liars is the standout tune and the one that suits Walters droney voice best. Some of the lyrics are great - as we would expect from someone who has written so many of Steely Dan's incisive lyrics."
3,For die-hard Steely Dan completists only,"With this solo effort from 1994, Walter Becker unfortunately shows that he is definitely Steely Dan's weaker half. To its credit, the album has some deep dark lyrics and haunting backgrounds that introspective songwriter types may find interesting, but from a standpoint of pure listening enjoyment, this album has practically nothing in common with any Steely Dan album, or even Donald Fagen's brilliant Nightfly album, and Becker simply does not have the distinctive singing style or voice of his longtime SD partner."
2,If you love Walt...,"I am a die-hard Steely Dan fan and love most of the solo work I have heard. And even though I am more of a ""Walt"" guy than a ""Don"" guy, I found this CD lacking the phenomonal production and performance standards Becker has previously set for himself. Most of it is not bad, but not particularly good. It just is. And I don't have room on the shelf for anything average or below."
2,Initial Disappointment....,"This is the first Steely Dan, Fagen and/or Becker related album that I didn't like and find totally addictive on first listen...I'm going to to give it a couple more spins but, initially disappointing : (11 Tracks Of Wack S**T"
1,Steely Don,"As a long time Steely Dan fan (as far back as ""Can't Buy A Thrill""), I thought that perhaps I passed over a hidden gem in this album. A friend of mine loaned it to me and all I can say is that it would've been better titled ""11 Tracks of [junk]""! This CD is unlistenable! I tried to imagine what it would sound like if the tunes had been sung by Donald Fagen but that wouldn't even help this weak effort. I honestly can't find one redeeming thing about it. Walter's vocals are about as unemotional and monotone as one can get. The compositions are predictable, uninteresting and amateurish and I've heard better production values in people's studio bedrooms. It's amazing to me that Mr. Becker is half of the writing team of one of the most brilliant writing duos of our time. As well as the CD title, the band should change their name to the real writing/singing strength in the band ""Steely Don"""
4,A Great Discussion Starter!,"I understand the concern that partially surrounds this book, i.e., does it encourage children to engage in potentially risky behaviors in order to help animals, but I think this book does a lot more good than harm. For example, I doubt that by reading this book, a child would be compelled to free an opossum from a roof gutter. Yes, I suppose that could happen, but realistically, I doubt it. What this book does really well is get kids and their parents talking about the respectful treatment of animals. It also encourages children to treat animals with kindness, which is fantastic.Matilda Mae: The Dog Who Needed a Name"
4,"Good, but small","Looks can be decieving.. This book is only a bit bigger than a 3x5 notecard. Its packed full of good recipes though, just a little on the tiny side when it comes to actual cook books. Although, it has an awesome authentic cover!"
2,Great German Recipes,Contains the most popular German recipes. Recipes seem to be consistent but instructions are not detailed. Probably would not have purchased the book if I had seen it beforehand.
4,compact booklet!,this recipe book is compact and easy to use. we haven't tried all of them yet but are working our way through the book!
5,GREAT METAL!!!!,"STORM WARRIOR is pretty much Germany's answer to MANOWAR. With titles like ""bound by the oath"" and ""defenders of metal"" you got to love it. all the songs on this one are fast, heavy and tiumphent songs about wielding axes, saying your iron prayer and defending metal with the sons of steel. This disc will have you pounding your fist and screaming the words. If your a fan of HAMMERFALL, MANOWAR, and DRAGONFORCE this CD is a must own."
5,Early Helloween's lost and unreleased album,"No, not really but if you love the very early Helloween material with Kai Hansen on vocals, this album will make you very wet.Excellent production and killer true power metal from Germany. Remember killer songs like RIDE THE SKY, PHANTOMS OF DEATH, SAVE US, VICTIM OF FATE, well you'll hear plenty of songs like that on this album - fast, loud and proud."
5,Perfect,Arrived on time and a good price. Our second pair from this company...great service both times.
2,Unknowledgeable Customer Service,"I called the customer service dept. of this seller before I purchased this item. I wear a woman's size 8 & the product description said that up to size 8 is a size 1, & size 8 & above is a size 2. Since my size fell into both categories and this item is non-returnable, I wanted to be sure that I'd be getting the right size. The person in customer service that I spoke to had no idea and was not familiar with the product. I ordered the size 1 & it was too small for me (it looked like it was sized for a child & it was supposed to fit up to size 8!) Now I am stuck with it, because they don't accept returns, even though I never used it. Also, this item is priced close to $40 & I was able to purchase very similar products for 1/4 of the price! Save your money & buy the ones they sell in your local drugstore, as my doctor reccomended."
3,Getting better!,I have purchased every heel pad available to help with heel pain. I even tried sleeping in a few braces to help stretch my arch & help the pain in my heel. My sister suggested I get these heel cushions - they look very much like some I had picked up at Walgreens but I was willing to try anything! I have had them for a few weeks and feel a huge decrease in the amount of heel pain! The only problem is they slide around in my shoes especially flats or walking shoes so need to be adjusted often. For the price I could only get one pair and need to switch to other shoes but so far Im happy with this investment! Shipped one day early!
4,well worth buying,"I think this is a beautiful journal to keep all of the memories of your precious animal that you miss so much. I like the little things like the first time you saw them and what happened the first time you brought them home.There are pages for photos and other things you might like to keep, like fur etc. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the beautiful memories of their pet."
4,Great book!,"When my dog died, I was devastated. This journal gave me a place to put those feelings. It gave me a place to remember him. I didn't give it a 5 star, because I would have liked to see a bigger book with more questions and journal space. Otherwise, it was great. I apprecaite the author for writing it."
5,Very Theraputic for Grieving Pet Owners,"A very good friend sent this to me when I lost my dog, Cosmo to cancer when he was just 8 years old. I found it very helpful with my grieving, so I have since sent it to four other friends. It is now filled with many fond memories and pictures."
4,Gothic Thailand,"The author continues to have a great eye and ear for the differences between Thai and farang (Western) culture. He humorously exploits these bi-cultural differences usually in a hip and slightly edgy way. The stories are fun and often take unexpected turns. If you have been to Bangkok you will probably feel you have sampled little bits of Dragon's Fin Soup tales.I have a personal prejudice, in that I loved the author's early science fiction works. At some point, however, his writing changed direction and he became a teller of gothic horror tales. For me, gothic horror could have stopped with Bram Stoker, and the world would be no worse off.While there is still more than a whiff of the abatoir in most of these stories, they don't sink under the gratuitous (and frankly boring) darkness and decay of his vampire novels. These stories show many glimmers of the imagination and savagely funny social commentary that made ""Mallworld"" a minor classic of science fiction."
5,Buy This Book,"I am a Police Officer, fingerprint examiner and composite artist and also possess a degree in psychology. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, cover to cover. This book is Karen Taylor's, but in many ways it belongs to all of us in the field of forensic art and illustration, because we now have one excellent source to refer to when needed. The documentation and references compiled here are immense. This is not a self-glorifying autobiography, or fodder for a made-for-tv movie. You won't see Ms. Taylor on Lifetime's Intimate Portrait. This book is Karen's masterpiece, a gift to all who toil in the trenches of police investigations."
5,A must read for forensic artists,"As a 20 year veteran of law enforcement and two years as a forensic sketch artist, I found this to be a very comprehensive text book to enhance my skills as a forensic sketch artist. For the forensic artist, this book is a must. It complements any forensic sketch class you may attend. Karen's book covers it all. She knew what was needed and did a great job of putting the information together in a well thought out book. I believe it will become the 'bible' of the forensic sketch artist."
5,I was very for,"This content, which was very easy to understand, made &#8203;&#8203;for.To their work in the future, is one that can be utilized.I think the world would like to introduce to everyone."
4,Forensic Art,"This book gives the complete history of forensic art. It also provides technical advice for the aspiring composite artist or forensic sculptor. It includes detailed photos, illustrations, anatomical diagrams, references, and detailed instructions."
5,Phenomenal Resource,I work for the television series Forensic Files and can honestly say that I have referenced this book more times than I can even begin to count. Karen Taylor is one of the most talented and creative artists. The dedication to her craft is clearly illustrated throughout this book. This book is a must have!
5,Forensic Art,This reading covers just about everthing that you need to know and keeps you entranced in its style.
5,Karen Taylor is still at the top!,"Though there is a new book out by another author, this is still the BEST book on forensic art. Karen Taylor's expertise and vast knowledge of forensic art, combined with a well thought out and readable style, sets it apart from the competition. If you want to be a master of your craft you need to learn from the master. This is the bible of Forensic Art!"
5,Nothing like it,"As a mystery writer I have to keep up to date with forensic developments, which can get pretty expensive--good forensic resources cost a lot more than mysteries. Forensic Art and Illustration is no exception in that regard, but it's more than worth the price because it's the only book on the subject I can imagine needing for the next decade or two. It covers simply everything, and even manages to do it in an interesting, extremely well-written manner. I actually found myself sitting down and reading it just for pleasure. A perfectly superb piece of work."
5,Invaluable resource!,"This text is a must-have for anyone interested or involved in forensic art. Karen Taylor does a remarkable job of providing the reader with a wealth of information in a clear, concise manner. The illustrations and photographs are not only useful, but exemplify how accurate forensic art can be when it's done well. This text is truly an invaluable resource."
5,The Ultimate in Forensic Illustration,"This is THE ONLY complete source on the subject of forensic illustration available today. Karen T. Taylor is not only artistically talented, but she can explain, communicate and relate her science so the lay person can fully understand and appreciate the art of forensic illustration. In today's computer world, it is important to understand that when it comes to composite drawings of criminals, etc., there is nothing better than the human hand and the art of listening, hearing and communicating to get across what is necessary to complete a true and accurate composite. Karen T. Taylor can take you there in this well-done and extensive source of forensic illustration. It is a must for every potential police sketch artist and every law enforcement agency!"
5,Memories,"My daughter recently turned 29 and this was her favorite book when she was little. I looked everywhere for the book and when I found the book I was so excited. My daughter laughed when she opened the present and said remember this book! Thank you for making my daughter's day. Excellent service and once again, thank you."
2,Text does not match announced title,"Book is described on cover and by Amazon as containing the Oedipus at Coloneus. However, the text is actually that of Antigone. It is not a bad text of the Antigone, especially since it has ample room for notes in the margins, and is fairly large and legible. As with almost any facsimile text like this, that's the main point, and anyone purchasing a Greek text will presumably realize that serious work requires checking against a more up to date edition. But since it's not the right play..."
3,3.5 Stars,"This is my favorite 2Pac album, although it's not the best. The raw hip hop emotion that he shows on this album is just to hard to describe. Makaveli is just full of classic material like Hail Mary, To Live & Die In L.A., Against All Odds and Bomb First. This is a definite MUST have."
5,"Don't think, BUY","If you think twice about buying this cd, you've already thought too long. This is the quintessential rap album and will likely never be topped by another rap cd ever. By far this cd is Tupac's pivotal point as a rapper, person, and political figure. If you buy one cd in your lifetime, this MUST be it."
4,Must have,"Any real fan of music must have a copy in their library, I wonder if Dick Clark had an original in his. It is just to bad that we have to keep buying the same things over and over through time. They just keep changing the format to how we listen."
5,Best 2pac album ever,"In my opinion this has to be the greatest 2pac album created. I do enjoy the rest of his work, but this album by far hands down is the best."
5,Best CD Ever!,"In my opinion, this is the best hip hop/rap cd ever released. It's better than Paid In Full, Ready To Die, or Illmatic. Sure, those albums are all considered classics but this album is still better. It has so much truth and heart, how could it not be the best? Any rapper can use multisyllabe flows, or paint vivid descriptions, but few could speak from the heart like 2pac could. This album shows people that 2pac wasn't just the weary remorseful rapper on Me Against The World nor was he completely the thug rapper on All Eyez On Me. This a great example of the duality of man and how we all feel different feelings. Few rappers could so easily describe feeling sad to angry to in love to suicidal like 2pac could. This is what makes this album better than all other hip hop/rap albums released."
5,2pac everlasting,The Makaveli cd is one of the hottest cd's he has out. If you don't have it please get it. Because it shows his sensitive side and his rough side. He is very multi-talented and when you hear this cd you will know why. This cd is BLAZIN'.
3,not the best,"This is my fifth favorite album by 2Pac. My favorite songs are ""Bomb First"", ""Hail Mary"", ""Toss It Up,"" ""To Live And Die In LA"", ""Life Of An Outlaw"", ""Just Like Daddy"", and ""Crazy"". But the song ""Me And My Girlfriend"" was a major disappointment. That's the reason why for the 3 stars."
3,Weak,"Unimpressed with the production and guest rappers. Love Pac always, but he can't really dis Nas since Pac himself never made an album as good as Illmatic."
5,Essential to Rap Collection,"Not many will disagree that 2Pac is one of if not the best rapper of all time. I don't know how BIG won out in the Source but so be it. This CD should be a staple in your collection. Right along side the classic Dr. Dre-The Chronic and SNoop DOgg-Doggystyle should be this album. It is tough these days to find an album that can be played all the way through without a few overly weak tracks. This CD doesn't have that. Even the Intro has a tight beat but Pac's lyrics and voice take it to a new level. This CD is pretty old by now, but it needs its props as a staple. Hail Mary, Toss it Up, Life of an Outlaw top 3."
5,Keepin It Real,This is the best rap cd I've ever heard. Me against the World and ThugLife 1 are also klassiks.
5,this is the bomb,"this album is deep. it has heaps of hidden messages, and the beats are all good as well. the song against all odds is phat, and how it sticks it to nas makes it evan betta. westside till i die. Tupac aka makaveli R.I.P"
5,The Bomb,"This cd is 2pac at his finest. I luv every track on this album. All eyez on me was great, but i like this cd even better, especially ""krazy"". This album has sold over 4 million copies to date."
5,Makaveli The Don,Makaveli A.k.a. 2pac alot of people think that he is nothing but violance and gangs but if people just listen to what he has to say and understainds what he stainds for i think alot of people would understaind. I also think that his death made his words more powerfull because alot more people listend to him.~ANONYMOUS~WEST COAST REGULATAZ
1,cover offence,I have never been more offended by a cover on a CD in my life I like 2Pac's music but this cover made me sick this guy is not Jesus and they had nerve to make a cover with 2pac on a cross.They talk about videogame's that offend people they should look at some music and Cd covers like this.
5,not pac's best but makes you wonder,"This album is started off with the phrase ""Suge shot him"". Now I think that Suge Knight killed 2pac for the money. This is not 2pac's best album but it has amazing production (bomb First and Hail Mary). I'd still add The 7 day Theory to my collection though."
5,Tupac Black Jesus,First of all it would not make any sense for suge to have tried to kill Pac come on that little money he owed pac is nothing compared to what he's getting sued for now so all you idiots hush with that noise. Anyway this album is timeless you could listen to this in 2059 and it will still be relevant. True LEgend
2,okay/alright,"Another over-rated album by 2pac. This album released after his death is Pac's most modest effort. The stand-out tracks, ""Bomb 1"", ""Hail Mary"", ""Toss It Up"" are his best, but not powerful enough to save the rest of this CD. Supposedly the wrath of his alter-ego Makaveli, this CD covers no new territory, sticking to the same ""been there, done that"" themes on ""All Eyez on Me"". Only HIS hardcore fans will call this a masterpiece. In my opinon, 2pac had already peaked.Peace El-715"
1,Good cd nope,I bought dis cd. Its bad. All of 2pacs death row stuff is bad bad bad bad bad!! II hate dis. Get Me against tha world instead its probubly 2 pacz bezt cd eva. It only has 2 bad songs but the rest arent dat bad. so get dat instead.
1,wack,"I cant find one good song on the whole thing, just ignore this record because it's wack.get me against the world though."
4,LUCKY # 13?!,"THIS BODY OF WORK WAS JUST ""THE BEGINING OF THE ENDING"" OF AMAZING HIP HOP/POLITICS/ACTING 2 COME.......CUT SHORT!"
4,Jaw droper,"This e-book is a good refresher course for MS ACCESS basics. It comes with a demonstration disk with examples,data filled tables and much more. The jaw dropper was the price. Amazing."
5,Another Fabulous Thriller,"Another spine-tingler by James Scott Bell, this book delves into the dark world of pornography, betrayal, and murder. Readers join Dallas (a successful pastor's wife) on her descent from a mega-church ministry into jails and seedy motels on a quest for truth--a truth that, if revealed, could cost her marriage and her husband's ministry. As always, Bell weaves subplots and dizzying twists into a mind-bending story.Memorable characters, engaging dialogue, and page-turning plot twists made this a book I couldn't put down. I loved the dramatic court case scenes, as well as the tender scenes between mother and children.It's not mere entertainment--it contains a message that many apathetic Americans need to hear. Pornography is a dangerous trap and industry leaders will not easily give up the dollars they filch. Bell portrays those truths without getting preachy, though it's one of the best sermons on purity I've read."
5,Another hit novel for James Scott Bell,"James Scott Bell doesn't disappoint, but that should be expected from the author of the definitive book on plot and structure. The writing is tight, the characters well-drawn, and there are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end."
4,A really great read!! 4 &1/2 stars,"This is the first book I have read by this author, and will definately be back for more. I loved the twist at the end, I never would have guessed. If the characters were better developed I'd have given it a 5 star. The secondary characters were very,very flat, but the book kept moving. All in all a pretty good read."
5,Another great novel from James Scott Bell,"Bringing in perhaps his most detailed plot in recent years, Bell has pulled out all the stops for this one. A pastor standing against pornography is suddenly accused of killing a porn star. That's enough for most writers, but Bell chooses to look at the story from the eyes of the pastor's wife--who is hiding a past of her own. I loved this book from the beginning to end, and the plot twists toward the climax really kept me reeling. I would easily put this as one of the top three he's written (and at 17 novels, that's saying something). Highly recommended."
5,The fear of God,"James Scott Bell is one of my favorite Christian writers, and this book will certainly put a healthy ""Fear of God"" into any man who has any chance to have any relationship with any woman other than his wife. I bought an extra copy for our Assistant Pastor at the church where I am the Pastor. I plan to reread it about every 6 months and suggested that he do likewise. Jim S"

1,Broken watch band,"Within a week of receiving the watchband, the clasp broke. I had to jerryrig the clasp with a piece of wire."
3,not her best,I have read many of Nancy Pickard's books & I have loved all of them until Confession. It starts out very slow. I put this book down the first time I started to read it but I went back to it. The second time I started to read it I almost put it down again but I know her books are good so I stayed with it. It did pick up a little & then it would get boring again. I did finish it & the ending was a surprise but not thrilling. It is not a book I will pick up and read again.
4,"Good price, Good garage stool","This is a very comfy, nice stool. However, no matter what we did, or how many time we took it apart and put it together, its wobbly. It's for the garage, so I guess its okay."
3,Looks good in the man cave.,"I bought this to go in my garage when I'm tinkering with my cars. It looks good, but there is not a lot of padding on the seat, so after awhile it starts to get uncomfortable. But I can't complain to much because it was not a real expensive stool."
2,A little wobbly... needed work.,"The stool is reasonably nice considering the price, but two of the legs were too short and caused the stool to wobble. I had to shorten the longer legs by cutting them to match. Now it sits fine."
3,"This book is isn't bad, It's meduim (Average).","This book had a lot of Crystals and Gems that come in all shapes, sizes and colors."
5,Crystal & Gem Book by DK Publishing,"Crystal & Gem (DK Eyewitness Books)This book is a great reference book for anyone wanting to enter the world of crystals and gems. My son asked for a diamond and talc so he could compare the hardest and softest minerals, so this is what Santa brought him since diamonds are a tad pricey!"
3,"My bad, didn't read the description thoroughly - nothing new","I already had a dvd with both of these movies, but the picture on the front was different. I saw this on sale and saw it was a 2-disc version and the description led me to think that there were extras not previously released. When we received and watched it, we obviously couldn't find anything different. So, I went back and compared my old disk with this version and found nothing new. It's just repackaging. Totally my fault, and although I have a blue ray and it won't go to waste, I'm still bummed that I bought it."
3,"Case was made for one disc, not two!!","**Note, this is just for the packaging I received. I haven't even watched the movie yet which I'm sure my kid will love.**I opened up the case and the blu ray copy was fine and where it should be, but the DVD copy was loose. I thought it just came out of its holder, but alas, there was nowhere to put it! It's a case made for one disc, not two! I easily switched out cases with an old movie we have a steelcase for, but still, this was just freaking weird."
5,Cute movie with cute extras,"Positive attitudes prevail. Good lessons, clean humor for kids and adults. Both movies/episodes are on there, plus the extra short. Cute extras are a surprise."
4,Very entertaining kids movie,We gave this to my daughter as a pre-Christmas gift. She has really enjoyed it and has watched it several times already. It was well worth the money.
5,Excellent Holiday Movie!,My niece & I enjoyed this beautiful and entertaining movie! Very creative and modern approach on elf's gift delivering. Both Prep & Landing and Arthur Christmas were the hits this last season!
5,Love it,These are two great movies and would recommend the short in the bonus features. My son watches it over and over even when it is not Christmas time.
2,Very disappointing,"Compared to Arthur Christmas this lacks in all aspects, but especially the story and the characters which isn't expected with a Disney production."
5,Kid at Heart!,I've watched this every year on prime time and decided it was time to buy the set. I'm still a kid at heart and enjoy this regardless whether it's x-mas or not. Great all year long!
5,Family Time Hit!,This was part of a Christmas gift to my two sets of grandchildren. It has been on every day in both houses.
5,Great addition to our holiday Collection,I picked this up for my 5 and 7 yr old girls and they loved watching if before Christmas. They laughed and smiled as they watched it.
5,Rocking flick!,"Each show is about half an hour, which is perfect timing for a quick feature prior to bedtime..This show is making its way into our Christmas traditions."
4,New Holiday Classic,"My 2 and 4 year olds love these stories. I actually enjoy them myself. I just wish the feature was a bit longer, but there is enough bonus material to make it worth buying."
5,I loved it and my kids live it!,Do I really need to say more? It shipped quickly and was on my doorstep waiting a day before I was expecting it.
5,Great movie for the family.,Three great video (one of them is a short) that are great holiday entertainment for the family of all ages.Happy holidays!!!
5,A New Favorite Christmas Movie,From the first year we saw Prep & Landing on TV we've loved this Christmas show! Our daughter's Elf on the Shelf brought this as a special present before Christmas. Both programs are great and the shorts and bonus features are equally great!
5,Best Christmas Special of my Kids' Generation,We absolutely love Prep and Landing and the Blu Ray is awesome with LOTS of bonus material. We will be enjoying this for many many years to come.
5,Hilarious and Heartwarming shorts,Prep and Landing are the most recent addition to our Christmas movie collection. They are definitely on our yearly watch list. I'd recommend these for everyone.
5,Short But Priceless!,"Each episode short, about 1/2 hour each, but priceless! Good entertainment for kids and adults. A great compliment to your holiday collection!"
5,One picks up where the other one left off,"Disney never seems to dissapoint me. They are always coming up with new and wonderfuf things. I decided to buy this because, I really enjoyed the first episode ""Prep and Landing""--which is included. The second installment-""Naughty vs. Nice"" is just as good. These are bound to be instant Christmas classics for the whole family. Highly recommended to everyone!"
5,I hope they make more...,I had seen these shows on tv before I purchased the dvd. I thought they were great. We need more decent family entertainment like this.
4,Fun family movie!,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and she loved it. The animation and story line were both good and entertaining, it's a great watch for the entire family!"
5,Delightful Disney humor!,"Short and cute stories even the little ones will be able to sit still for and enjoy! I love animation, and Disney did not disappoint."
4,good dvd,bought it for christmas for my grandson. he loved it. i thought the theme was a little peculiar but overall it was good.
4,It works well,ProsIt is well built. A strong and long eiough handle.Cons.The head is a little wide to get into tight spots.
2,Problems with tool design,"The lights in my 2002 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor were completely misaligned. I used this tool to realign the lights. As I backed the adjustment stud out to aim the vertical aim of the headlight it trapped the wrench on the 4mm hex end because there was not enough clearance between the hex end and the radiator. I had to screw the hex back in with an adjustable wrench after removing the radiator shroud cap, removing this tool and making the adjustments with the adjustable wrench, then replacing the radiator shroud cap. About four times the work of not using this tool. I gave this tool away to a friend three days after it arrived.If it were an open end wrench of the same design it would be great but the closed design causes problems in tight spaces.-Pete"
2,"This 7/8"" Thick Wrench Is Too Thick For Some Cars","Get the KAS-5529A Ratcheting WrenchKAS-5529A WRENCH FORD HDLGHTinstead. It is about half as thick as the Lisle Wrench. The KAS-5529A wrench looks more like a conventional box end ratchet wrench, and comes with both 4mm and 4.5mm ends to fit other vehicle headlight adjuster bolts.This ""Lisle 14540 Headlight Adjusting Ratchet for Ford"" is made moderately well, but it is too thick to fit properly between the headlight and radiator firewall of my 1999 Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor. This wrench's 4mm sleeve is held in place by press fitted washers on either side. It can't be made much thinner.This Lisle wrench may just fit onto the top adjusting bolt, but if the bolt moves backward to raise the headlight beam, the wrench may not be removed from the bolt. The headlight retaining plate(s) must then be popped loose to allow the headlight assembly to move forward enough to allow the wrench to be removed from the adjusting bolt."
3,The head was too large to work properly,"After I replaced the old faded headlights on my 2000 Ford CVPI, I noticed that they needed to be adjusted. I called a ""local and official"" state lamp adjusment shop and they quoted me $80 to adjust the two new headlamp assemblies I bought on E-Bay for $50. Right. So I tried to adjust them myself but it was very difficult and time consuming. I bought this tool from a local Napa Auto Parts store. The tool worked OK but unfortunately because the head is so big, it would only turn to a certain extent before being stopped by the other metal piece to the rear of the headlamp assembly unit. Another reviewer below mentioned the same problem. So in the end, the tool was really useless because I could not use it to completely turn the small screws all the way back towards the rear. Ford made such a poor design of their frame that I cannot believe how hard it was to change out my bulbs and headlamp assembly much less adjust them properly."
3,Good little tool,"Turns out I didn't even need the darn thing. On my '94 Bronco the adjustment screws extend up above the facia enough so that if I'd known better, I could have adjusted the lights with a pair of pliers. I can't imagine having to use this tool in a tight place or having to reach down and in to try and find the adjustment screw. The fit is very tight and I had trouble fitting the end of the tool into the end of the screw to turn the screw. So know exactly where the adjustment screw is before you buy this product. If you have no other way, then I definitely recommend it."
4,"Good for reference, needs some clarification...","This book is loaded with great information! The only issue I have with it, is that it lists lots of vitamins & supplements to help many conditions, but doesn't tell you if you're supposed to take ALL of them or SOME of them. Also, it doesn't always tell you a dosage you're supposed to take, just lists the name. I have found the supplements for fibromyalgia very beneficial! Recently used it to find natural cures for sinuses and colds as well. Overall I recommend it for finding out more information about natural healing, but would suggest asking a doctor or pharmacist about how much to take & what to take together."
3,"Has Some Good Information, but...","Tried to put into practice the message, but it was not very easy to implement. I ended up not using this book as much as I thought I would. I have not picked the book up again after reading it. It was not practical for me."
3,natural is not cheap,"This is a good book and has many great ideas but the remedies are not cheap to use. With natural being so needed, it is ashame the cost of doing it the right way"
4,Good Source of Relevant Information for Todays Health Issues Now,I found this book very informative about so many of today's ailments with simple easy to follow instructions that are very doable without great expense. A very good book for your health library. Make the investment into this book.
5,ss under counter paper towel holder,Works great and the price is so reasonable. I have absolutely no problem with any size paper towels with this holder.
2,Not very good.,"This tpwel holder doesn't hold the towels well. One has to hold the towels FIRMLY with one and and pull, to keep it in place. If you tear the towel off with one hand, the whole roll of towels lands in the sink (ours is attached to a cabinet above the sink)."
5,"Attractive and modern, easy to install and use.","When I purchased this item, I planned on hiding it on the inside of my kitchen cabinet door, but when I saw how stylish and modern it was, I changed my mind and mounted it just as it is seen in the Amazon.com advertisement photo- in full view. It's beautiful, and very easy to use. Great gift idea too."
2,Garbage. Rubber balls come off,"had it for less than a month when the slot on one of the rubber balls tore. The ball comes off now, evertime i change rolls"
2,Nice design - but not well put together,"I love the look of this thing, and it works well when it's holding together. BUT... the rubber balls that hold the roll of towels on and just stuck onto these metal points. Now that we've been using it for 1-2 years, they come flying off when you try to pull towels off. It's become a real pain, and I'm replacing it."
1,Not Recommended,Finally got rid of this thing. Over time the rubber balls do not stay in place. Very frustrating.
1,The worst paper towel holder on the planet!,"Who knew one could feel so strongly about a paper towel holder? Yet, I curse mine at least twice per day. The problem is that this holder doesn't hold ...the paper roll falls right off just about every single time you try and tear off a sheet. In fact, I actually get a little rush if I manage to tear a piece off while keeping the thing on the holder. Worse? The black spongy balls sometimes fall off and I've actually cut my hand in the sharp metal edge on two occasions, drawing significant blood. I just bought a new holder and can't wait for it to arrive!"
3,Works pretty good,"only issue. installed in our RV, and after about 2 hours of driving, half the paper towel has come off and is laying on the ground. No tension to keep it from un-rolling. Fiix that, and that is a 4-5 star."
2,Flimsy,I' not a big fan of this item. I tried screwing it under my cabinents for easy access but the screws were too small to make a good strong connection. It's pretty flimsy materials and very hard to get a roll of paper towels in and out easily. I would not buy it again.
3,Functions well and looks great,This item works well and looks good but after buying it I found a similar one at Walmart that was a little heavier guage stainless and about $5 cheaper so I wish I had looked in the stores first.
5,Paper Towel Holder,This is the best under counter paper towel holder out there. I had purchased two before this and installed them under the kitchen cabinet at work and they always gave us issues. Finally a product that did exactly what it should.We all thank you!
4,Can't Complain,"I bought this to replace one I bought at target that snapped in half when I tried to change the role the first time. This one has no moving parts, looks good, and it solidly built. If you like the way it looks, buy it. You will not be disappointed."
1,Not spectacular,"I bought this paper towel holder because I wanted an under cabinet model with a brushed stainless finish to go with our kitchen remodel. The big problem: when you tear off a paper towel, the whole roll comes off of the holder more times than not! Very annoying. We have only had it for about three months - my husband is so frustrated with it that he asked me to find a different one, and specifically asked that I post a review here so that others will not waste their time and money."
2,Looks nice but towel roll falls off easily,"The towel roll is held on by 2 balls that fit into the paper towel roll. Unfortunately, over time the slots of the balls that meet the metal arms widen and easily fall off. Chasing the ball from under the fridge has me shopping for a new holder. I gave it 2 stars because it is stylish and easy to install but too frustrating to use - unless you can figure out how to permanently attach the balls to the metal arms."
2,Mediocre,Doesn't hold the paper towels with tension so it takes two hands to tear it off. Not what they advertised.
1,Don't Buy,I have had this exact same paper towel holder. The biggest problem is the sharp metal edges rub and grind the paper towel roll. This causes huge amounts of paper / saw dust piling up on the counter top. Junk.
1,Does NOT fit a 1978 MG Midget,Beware!!! This part does NOT fit a 1978 MG Midget that it is advertised for. My MG was off the road for two weeks while I went back and forth too get the correct part. It is obvious this fits the MGB and NOT the Midget.
3,ok,"I love Dantone's WTC 2 which is probably the best harpsichord WTC 2 I've heard so far. But in WTC 1, he is too indulgent. Which is perfectly fine in the preludes, but it seems to me that when you pause too often and use too much rubato in the fugues, it totally breaks up the counterpoint. And this is what happens with Dantone fugue after fugue.I like Dantone so I'll keep this CD regardless but it is not one I return to often."
5,Music that Rocks and Swings,"I discovered Jimmy Sutton through JD McPherson, and after watching tons of YouTube performances I knew I couldn't go wrong if I bought this album. And I was totally right. This music rocks and swings and is even a little bit humorous. Jimmy and the guys are talented musicians and obviously have a great time making music. Can't wait to grab their other album, too!"
4,Better Than the First!,"I actually like this one better than the first release. It's a great, eclectic mix of FM radio hits from the golden age of FM radio. (I was 15 in the summer of 1976, so maybe I'm a little biased.)All of these songs were part of the soundtrack of my life, played at suburban basement make-out parties and blasted from the windows of gas-guzzling old American cars. How I wished I could have grown a mustache like the ones sported by Foghat!"
5,Where's Bob Dylan's Hurricane?,"I'm also a bit ""miffed"" (and that's the clean version!) to say the least that another classic track isn't on the album. Aerosmith's 'Sweet Emotion' is a painful loss, I agree with ""music fan"" who mentioned the same. It was a hell of an opening song and really set the mood. And the main characters were going to buy tickets to an Aerosmith concert at the end, so it's an obvious omission. Oh well...cool album anyway!!"
4,A good choice but the first album is better,"Even More Dazed and Confused picks up right where the first album left off, collecting all of the tracks which the former left off. On the whole, however, the first album consists of a slightly higher quality of music making it a better album. That is not to say though that this album isn't quite excellent in its own right, but maybe it would have been better to package the two as a double disc set. In the end, my only real grievance is with the fact that Bob Dylan's ""Hurricane"" was passed over, a spectacular song which would have been a far superior choice to ""Lord Have Mercy on My Soul""."
5,excellent 70's album,"this CD combines the great music before disco, when rock and roll was just great fun to listen to. If you remember sitting up all night jamming to ""Never Been Any Reason"" and being rather sentimental when you heard ""Summer Breeze"" this Cd may be the one for you. This is some of the best music of the 70's"
5,even more dazed and confused,"This CD is AWESOME. Once I saw the movie on TV, I was hooked. All the music on this CD was in my time era in High School in 1975-1979. This Cd takes me back to those days of High school, the party's, music, and all of the fun. I believe this is my favorite CD that I have in my possession. High School was one of the best times of my life."
4,Even More Dazed and Confused,"If you loved the Dazed and Confused soundtrack, you'll love this one too. It contains all those songs that they couldn't fit on the first soundtrack. Great CD."
4,A Very Good Companion Piece,"Though it's not quite as good as the first volume, this follow-up companion piece soundtrack is a great selection of songs both from the movie and from the time period. I can think of a few songs on here (""Summer Breeze""! Excuse me, did I cough?) that are a little out of place (it fits though, because it was in the movie), but that's not my call. What's on here I can't argue with. Chances are, if you're checking this out, you have at least a passing knowledge of classic rock, and this album is a great way to acquaint yourself with some of the excellent rock n' roll from this time period. All in all, a fine companion to the first volume and to the movie. It's chock-full of good-timey playful rock from the mid-to-late 70's."
3,"Great hits, but something's missing","This album was a terrfiic purchase, if you are looking for classic 70's rock you should certainly buy this CD. However, I was disappointed by the absence of such songs as 'Boston' and 'Champion.' These two classics (and others from the movie that were left off the first album), certainly should have been included on this CD. Nevertheless, two thumbs up!"
4,Outstanding Nostalgia!,"I have to preface this by saying I have not yet listened to the first ""Dazed"" CD (though I have seen the movie at least 5 times). Boy does the movie and the music hit home! I spent my high school years in a similar town in Mississippi during the late 70's (76-79) where the main activity was cruising (I drove a Chevy short-bed with a 350 4-barrel w/ 3 on the column shifting) with an 8 track player (complete with cardboard shims to jam in to help the tape play correctly). Drinking beer, cruising and being part of high school was our life back then and boy does this music bring that all back to me.I can't wait to listen to the original soundtrack.Patrick Mahan Santa Cruz, CA"
1,This book is s ripoff,It says Lilith Prints.It is a 12 page litany of God having intercourse with Lilith... Very disappointing.Only 2 images ....
1,difficult installation and support,"first of all the installation asks for a serial number that you have to get from corel with your proof of purchase from amazon. than you have to email this proof to an address that does not exist. then make a phone call and wait on line for 12 minutes. Then creat an account online where you need your SERIAL NUMBER (which you dont have) in order to set up the account in order to send the email requesting help. Then wait for 24 hours for a reply. Mean while I am wasting my life away putting up with this nonsense. No I take that back I will throw this cd (WinDVD Gold 8) in the trash, and use another product."
2,Retruned - did not work with my setup,Returned software as it crashed my computer several times before I uninstalled it.I ran SATA RAID Verion 1 hard drives Mirror on an AMD 2500+ cpu. Software worked intermitantly. This software is likely in big trouble.I have since donated this computer and upgraded to Vista Home Premeium. Vista has what initially appears to be a very nice DVD decoder/viewer included.First return with Amazon was smooth with account credit posted
1,WinDVD 8 does not work properly on Windows Vista,"WinDVD 8 has many problems on Windows Vista despite claims by its maker that it is compatible. If you run Vista, do not buy WinDVD.You will find that the boxed retail version crashes when playing mpeg files. The download version behaves differently but fails to play audio when playing MPEG files (as opposed to DVDs).Support from Corel/Ulead/Intervideo effectively does not exist. The software patch available from Corel fails to install properly. Also, they will not honor returns on the retail product.If you still want to try this product, definitely do not buy the retail version. They offer a free trial download. Maybe it will work better for you. As for me, money down the drain."
3,wind Dvd 8 Review,"Recieved the product as advertised. It turns out that the product is an EOM version, not the full program that I thought I was getting.This fact was not disclosed by the provider or Amazon prior to my purchase. I am using it on a second computer that does not have surround sound, and the product is doing a satisfactory job."
2,Not quite as I thought,I thought it was going to be pockets but its just a strip that hold it. I have too many oils and does not fit
3,Essential Oils Portfolio,I like the fact that you can organize the oils alphabetically. You have to tug at the zipper at the beginning to zip the portfolio back up.
2,GREEN Alert! Hideous Color!,"I ordered Forest Green but this green is hideous! It looks more like a dayglo reptilian skin that should be oozing some kind of radio-active green goo. Obviously a trait that does not show on either computer monitor that I re-checked after receiving this.My favorite color is green. I was expecting a calming natural green as is usually suggested by Forest Green. There is nothing natural looking about this color. Instead, it looks like something better suited for a toy dinosaur. YUCK!I have their original Black leather-like portfolio and it is much nicer and more professional looking. I have carried it for 7 years with no problems. Liked it so much that I decided I wanted another when I saw they had added the shoulder strap. I chose the green this time so I could easily differentiate between my singles and blends cases. What a mistake!This green looks cheap and and the white backing only adds to the sensory insult."
3,It Works....,"It's better than the containers I was using. However, previous reviews are correct, it really doesn't hold 64 bottles. Also, one of the straps broke when I put in my oil. But overall, it's functional."
3,oils case.....,I liked the concept of the case and had it been so I could put bottles with droppers in and had room inbetween rows ...the fact the bottles were carried upright was wonderful as some seep .......go back to the drawing board and I will keep my eyes open ...Thanks...I sold it and far as I know the gal loves it.....
3,eh,Im not sure that this item was worth the money. There has got to be something online thats the same quality for cheaper.
1,Disappointed,Cheap material and understood it came with the 64-bottles of oils. Very overpriced. Deceiving. Just a less than appealing case. Holds the bottles in place.
3,Nice but....,"It's really a nice case, but, the zipper comes apart after you zip it, therefore, it doesn't stay closed."
2,DISSAPOINTED,"I purchased this in May and the other reviews are correct - the elastic stretches out and the bottles fall out when i open it. It is not good because some of these oils are extremely expensive and I don't want to loose any of them. I tried to contact seller but because it was longer than 30 days, amazon doesn't leave me that option, and it takes longer than 30 days for the elastic to stretch out.I would suggest you purchase the more expensive container that is like a box with foam to hold them. Its easier to read with a Essential Oil sticker on the cap and no risk of loosing the oils when they fall out and possibly break."
4,Massage Therapist,"This case has come in handy. I'm able to have my oils to sell on one side, and my oils I use on the other. The only thing I'd like to improve is have a strap or something to help keep it braced when flipped open to display the oils. I have to be careful on how I set it up so it will not fall over/flat."
5,16 bottle essential oils case,Nice case - elastic bands are a bit of a pain to put the bottles in until you get the hang of it. They do hold the bottles securely though. Easy to carry and travels well.
3,Not the best,I reviewed this before I tried to store my oils in it. The elastic bands are sturdy and so will hold well if the bottle is held around its neck. The zipper always backs up to a place that has to be dug out to close. My complaint is that no way will this hold 64 bottles. You will lose 8 spaces on each side...16 spaces because the bottles (.5ml) are too long. The case should be longer. I think this case is overpriced.
5,Love this product.,"This is the perfect way to keep my essential oils. I have them stored alphabetically. It is easy to find, and they are stored neatly. It sets neatly on the counter all zipped up."
1,shipping cost more than bulbs!,Notice the shipping for this item is $6.90 and the item costs just $5.99. That is ridiculous for an item that would cost 42 cents to mail.
3,"Charged, but didn't update","This product was advertised to both charge and update older iPods. The charging function works great. Unfortunately, my iPod is too old (model MB562LL) to be updated using a firewire cable."
3,didn't know it was fw400,Would be fine if i knew it was fw 400 not fw 800 doesn't list it at allpositive is it is new
1,Do Not Buy!,"If you want to get ripped off, by all means, get this. It doesnt even look like the picture, or fit into the USB port."
1,go to the apple store,"For a replacement cable to connect your iPod to your charger or your computer, go to the apple store online. I have a third generation iPod and I bought a firewire cable for $19.00."
5,A True Musical Artwork,"I first saw Mitch and Carla of Zoe Speaks perform at a cafe downtown. The show was excellent! When I purchased their CD (Pearl) and listened, it was like being at the cafe all over again. Mitch and Carla sing in beautiful vocal harmony which makes their music more dynamic and moving. Many of the songs have acoustic guitar duets under the vocals which keeps the mix organized and relaxing to listen to. They sing with the perfect amount of energy and play their guitars with powerful integrity. The lyric content is based on old appellation mountain life, but Mitch and Carla add a modern twist by addressing issues of today. Some songs even feature comical lyrics with an upbeat tempo and additional appellation instrumentation. The album Pearl is fun to listen to not only on your home stereo, but on the road too!"
5,Group 87 Redux,"Back in 1980 I came across this release. My mind and musical taste were and still are open. I took a listen purely due to the album cover. I was immediately enthralled.As mentioned in previous Positive Reviews...the streamlined yet dynamic arrangements and musicianship captivated me big time. There was no need to scramble to define the listening experience other than experiencing something dynamic and new. Fastforward to present day...I do own a copy on CD. Also I did follow the musical careers of Maunu, O'Hearn, Isham. As with any musical release, one should put it into the context of when it was released. Had the opportunity to speak one on one with Maunu...he stated that they were stripping away what had been,with regards to the fusion era."
1,all-too-80s new employee training video background music,"I had A Career in Dada Processing on vinyl. Saw this cd used for a low price, and thought, how bad could it be?It arrived in the mail as my wife and I were hopping in the car to run errands.After 3 or 4 tracks, I started to exclaim how bad this cd was. My wife was saying, ""I didn't want to say anything, but yeah, it is really bad.""We had fun trying to describe the special 80s way it was bad. It sounds like music for some 80s new employee training video, or 80s infomercial, tv interlude, etc.Frankly, it has no soul. Sure, good musicianship, but nothing really moving or engaging about it.I love Mark Isham's music, incl the other Group 87 album.This is going into the garage sale pile."
5,"Quick, effective workout!","I love this video! I just did it for the 1st time...I was planning on just doing the 1st 20-minute workout (I haven't worked out in a few weeks, so I thought I'd take it slow), but it went by so fast and it was so fun, I ended up doing the second one too! Denise Austin is really encouraging, and the moves never got boring. The beach setting is nice, too...it gives you something else to look at instead of the inside of a fake aerobics studio, like some tapes. I've done a lot of videos, and I'd definitely rate this one in my top 3."
2,ONLY for the super-coordinated,"Denise Austin is very nice and fun to watch, and it is in a great beach setting, but her steps are soooo COMPLICATED, you need to be a dancer to do them. I have been doing FIRM workouts for years, and I don't get discombobulated very easy, but I felt like I was tripping over my own feet (""Okay, grapevine, boxstep, mambo, turn and jump!""). I almost landed on my head, and the funny thing is, she even trips over HER feet when she is doing it (Watch carefully...you'll see her stumble). How does she expect us to do it???She seems really nice, really. But I can't reccommend this video."
3,Second half's better,"The first half isn't particularly fun or challenging and doesn't make you feel like you're achieving much, so I always skip it and go straight to the second. The second half contains a good interval training workout, being cardio interspersed with 1 minute weights reps. It's a good 20 minute workout for when you don't have much time. The only criticisms are that I found Caroline (one of the 2 people doing the workout alongside Denise) really irritating, and advanced exercisers probably wouldn't find this workout enough, both in terms of length and difficulty."
2,Not for people who jiggle,"I'm overweight and was looking for something with more cardio/aerobics than what I had so I could burn some fat. This video is not for anyone with flab. You'll be jiggling all over and tripping on your feet. This is for people who want to tone, not lose weight. It's also very bad for people that aren't super coordinated. I got frustrated and turned it off after ten minutes. There is no teaching or steps to show you the moves, she just jumps right in at full speed and leaves you behind wondering what the hell is going on."
1,I hated this video,"Ok to start out with i love Densie Austin she is my favorite workout instructor but this tape was very boring and the music was not fun or energetic at all. I found it to be issuficiant for getting your heart rate up and yes i was sweating but i was well aware that my heart rate was very low and i felt like i was not doing enough work, To be fair i havent tried the interval workout but i plan on giving it a try but based on the arobic workout this is not i good tape for a person who excersies on a regular basis. I just stoped five minutes before the workout ended not because i was tired but because i was so bored!!"
1,Yuck!,"This is a good workout if you can tolerate Denise Austin. I can't. Her constant, sacchrine patter is extremely annoying."
4,Skip the first...love the second,"I found the first workout on this video to be a bit dull and not a very hard workout. The second workout, however, is fantastic! If you have a short attention span, like I do, and want to get a great workout in 30 minutes, this is the one for you. I even find myself daydreaming about it at work. Great job, Denise!"
3,Ok....,"This video was not was I was looking for. The first set of exercises I felt were boring, I am not into the cha-cha or charleston. I do however, enjoy the second set of exercises, and start with this portion of the tape every time I workout."
4,"Works, but hard to follow","This was my first workout video I bought about 10 years ago when I was a slightly overweight teenager. It was difficult to follow. She often wouldn't tell you what move she was going to do next until she was already doing it. On one rep she would do a movement 2 or 3 times and the next time just do it once. She seemed to be making it up as she went along- you could almost see her thinking ""hey, I should be doing something with my arms- maybe this!"". The only other negative thing about it is her constant frantic shrieking. It reminds me of a miniature schnauzer I used to have that would get so excited to see us come home it would pee all over the floor. With the volume down, it is tolerable, and with all that being said, I did this video 5 times/week for the summer and lost about 35 pounds."
1,YAWN! Generic Aerobic Video...,"While I admire Denise Austin's energetic enthusiasm and encouragement, her actual workout is lacking. Don't get me wrong, I was sweating, but my heartrate told a different story. If you're looking for something with a cheesy techno beat slightly confusing routines, this is for you. I would not recommend this video to anyone with doubts about their coordination."
3,Good Concept,My son loves to create games. He would design and create games on a daily basis. We bought this so he could make multiple games but the pieces are not reusable.
5,Great CD,saw her live in concert. excellent voice and accompaniment.favorite track?? jonathan white? white monkey? yea
5,Beautiful CD --Promising New Talent,"I just loved this CD. Miss Spencer has a lovely, soothing voice.The music really does have a dream-like quality."
2,"Great premise, terrible book","The title and description of this book make it sound really good - a scrubby 40 year old writes a manifesto on how to live your life without watching what you eat, how you exercise, etc...you know, sort of like Fight Club. However, within a few pages our overweight, disgusting narrator meets a beautiful young girl and proceeds to spend the rest of the book with her and her tall, hot friend. The book goes absolutely nowhere and by the time it ends with a ridiculously pornographic (and not to mention LONG) section in a bizarre sex club, you're thrilled that it's over. Dissapointing."
1,Do Not Buy this Book if you are Plus Size,The book description states it is for any size but then only supplies patterns for S-M-L.
1,"Brand New Book from Amazon, But No Patterns???","I only just received my brand new copy from Amazon, and have been scratching my head. I read all the other reviews about making sure to buy a new copy - - - NOT used - - - because of the supposedly included patterns that the book is based on. I don't quite understand. I should have gotten patterns with this book - right? It's brand new, with the price to prove it! Not from Amazon Marketplace or used, NEW. WHERE ARE MY PATTERNS???I can't use the book without the patterns --- if there were minus stars, that's what I'd give this book - because they sold it to me with the understanding that the patterns would be included - so minus the patterns equals minus stars."
3,OK but not brilliant,"(Most of) the designs are classics and the instructions are very clear and straightforward - no difficult steps at all, so suitable patterns for beginners. Replacement patterns are still available from Betzina's website - do a web search for ""Sandra Betzina Rodale Patterns"" and it'll come up no problem. Wardrobe advice is very dated now, unless you like the Annie Hall layered look. All in all a good buy but most of the designs are probably available in similar commercial patterns at your local fabric store if you don't already have something in your pattern drawer. The sewing techniques recommended in the book can be adapted to any commercial pattern, including the pants..."
2,"No patterns, Limited sizes, Frumpy clothes","At I review this, the book is 10 years old, and fashion has moved along, this is no fault of the author. And if you were looking to sew a dress with a chunky cowl neckline, or slim pull on pants, or a raglan-sleeved dress you have your book. Sadly, the clothes as photographed scream HOMEMADE rather than fitted and well-tailored. I give her credit for showing different sized gals as models but the clothes are not flattering on them all, they often look like the clothes are wearing them. As mentioned, there are no patterns with the book, and the size range is limited to S - M - L, with no intent to cover bust > 43""; waist > 36"", or hips > 46"". Her sewing tips are good, but are available in her other books."
3,How do you acquire the patterns that this book is based on?,"I have just gotten my copy of this book (used). There are a couple of items that could be really, really useful to me such as the full pants, the full teeshirt, the skirt, and perhaps, the shawl-collar jacket. Here is my problem. Are the patterns she uses for the book still available, anywhere? I have never seen Rodale patterns in a store. Nowhere in the book does it tell where you are supposed to get them. I THINK I can substitute similar patterns from other lines and make changes in them, but it would be far simpler if I could just get the patterns the author uses. Perhaps the patterns were supposed to be included with the book. If so, they were gone before I got my copy, used."
3,type too small to read easily.,I have had this book before and enjoyed the devotions. But now I find it too small to read it continually. Barb Selander
5,Daily Comfort for the Bussiest of Us,"So little time, not enough time.... busy, busy, busy.... life pulls us all in a thousand directions at once. This small concise daily devotional takes a couple minutes.The result has been not just the Hope in the title but the Comfort these glimpes of His Word give...I've bought and given away dozens of these through the years. To loved ones and friends. Also to strangers who shared a hopeless situation they faced....Hope for Each Day ... is a book for all persons and times."
5,Exellent daily bread!!!,"This will get you started each morning(or night), it will get you into the word of jesus Christ, and you will be blessed from the wisdom and annointing of Billy Graham."
3,Translations?,This is a review regarding the inclusion of translations only. There aren't any. The booklet only contains the text in German. Why this information is not required of record companies I do not know.
2,Not worth 46 bucks,This book is more geared toward MT exams rather then MLT exams. This being the opinion of myself and a co-wroker also working toward her MLT (ASCP) Typos abound in the answer keys be warned!
1,I was so sad =(,"I bought this book because I was guaranteed it's all I need to pass the exam, but I failed. This study guide did not deliver its promise (boo-hoo-hoo). I would like to rate this book as zero stars."
5,"Interesting, often captivating read","I read this book with no previous knowledge of (or interest in) Borneo, and I really enjoyed it. It was fascinating to learn about this part of the world, and realize there were still wild places like this so close to heavily populated areas in Asia. The author's adventures were always interesting, even if I did feel at times he was a bumbling idiot, floundering around in a place where he didn't belong. At the same time, I applaud his honesty for telling us how unprepared he was at times, and about the mistakes he made. Though it may have made him look like a fool at times, I respect him for being this honest about the things that didn't go right. Other reviews will offer you better details, but I just wanted to add my voice to the choir. Definitely worth reading this book."
4,Maybe you gotta be there...,"You don't find many current travel writers heading off to the tropical rain forest of Borneo. I'm still not really sure why Hansen headed there. He seemed to like this place, despite deadly snakes, really inadequate toilet facilities, awful food (he mentions eating rotten fish many times), and scary tribal people. Maybe you gotta be there."
1,Even my 6 year old daughter thought this book was idiotic.,"My review title really says it all. This book was horribly written, and not at all entertaining, even to a 6 year old. It says something about the publishing world that this dreck is even in print. This is totally lacking in imagination or intelligence and the artwork is ghastly."
3,For Children,Sweet book but very slim and the drawings are not the type that I admire. It's a good book tho especially for children.
5,It is about time...,"It's about time... After Embrya, I was anxious to hear Maxwell's next music adventure. ""Get to know ya"", was well worth the wait. This CD single is wonderful and it makes me think that his next CD, ""NOW"" will be da bomb. Looking forward."
5,"Great bar, easy to use!","This is a great bar. I almost didn't get it based on the other review list here; however, Shubb is a very good company that I have done business with for some time. I didn't think they would put out an inferior product in an area that they have had good success in. I believe that I was correct. I have the Van Meter bar, which is good and Shubb 2, which is ok but feels heavy and clumsy to me. This bar has the same volume, I can't hear a difference and I have tried them side by side. It is quicker and much easier to execute pull offs and slants. I recognize there differences in the type of instruments being played, hand size and technical ability, with that in mind I would still highly recommend checking this steel out. Besides, how many resophonic guitarist do you know that have only one steel? Try it, I think that you will like it."
5,more than enuff for the job,"I have this bar and i love the heft of it, it tackles all of my dobro needs impressively"
3,Shubb Bar,I am happy with the quality and workmanship they are first rate. I do not like the feel of the thing. It almost feels too high.I ordered a Stevens and trimmed the end down and like the feel a lot better. All of this is subjective of course. It is pretty pricey so you might want to try and borrow one before you buy.
5,Great slide,For a newbie to the lap steel like me the combo hardwood and stainless steel is a brilliant weight and feel and definitely a wonderful sound too. I would recommend it to anyone
1,Lucado says what he wants,"Reviewing a book such as this is tough. Lucado presents a heart warming philosophy. More of us should adopt it. However, Lucado tends to focus on what he wants. Using scripture to inforce what he is saying, ignoring either verses that counter his point or arrogantly misquoting scripture. Either way you can find books that are truer to scripture and more satisfying also."
5,Easily read and very inspirational.,"If you have any questions about your life and what direction it's in, this book is for you. I couldn't put this book down. I received a huge amount of insperation and answers to alot of questions. A very powerful piece of reading. ""God loves you just the way you are, but refuses to let you stay that way. He wants you to be just like Jesus."""
5,If you want to know more about Jesus... this book is it!,"I was absolutely amazed at the simple way that Max Lucado presented Jesus. It really helped me to understand the awesome power and love that God has for humans and it has truly inspired me to become ""Just Like Jesus"". I'd recommend this book to anyone who is searching for something that is easy to understand and teaches you a great deal about God and his only Son, Jesus. Max Lucado has the gift of writing as if he were talking to you one-to-one and you can really ""listen"" and absorb what he is saying to you."
3,A Bit of a disappointment,"I am a Max Lucado fan. I am also a Joe Beam fan. But I must say I was a bit disappointed in this book by Max. He was very general and seemed to repeat himself.Don't get me wrong, it is a descent book but Max's best was ""No Wonder they Call Him the Savior"" and ""He Still Moves Stones."""
2,"Good stories, no meat","Like most of Max Lucado's work, this book is a good compliation of stories with very little to offer in the way of thought provoking writing. It's great for a devotional, feel good, book but won't tell you anything to challenge your mind."
5,Easy Read,"A great book! I was told that Max Lucado writes great, easy to read books...and it's true. I flew through this book in a couple of days. Very entertaining and eye-opening. May we all strive to be ""Just Like Jesus!"""
5,Wonderful book to take Christians further,"Lucado does mankind a great service introducing this often humorous portrayal of Jesus. Not since Patton's breath-taking ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" have I read anything like this. Both Patton and Lucardo breath life into the man history refers to as Jesus in such a way that he is pertinent to our daily lives. Highly recommended!"
5,"Uplifting, Food for a Troubled Soul.....","I read this book during a very bitter custody battle in which it was very hard to even think about ""being like Jesus"". As I read the book, I began to find peace that nothing else provided. Reading about Jesus from this point of view will really help you see that indeed you are not going through anything Jesus did not. I recommend it highly for anyone who desires to be more like Jesus but is unsure how."
2,"Lightweight, fluffy, devotional","For a title ""Just Like Jesus"" this book should have contained 80% solid theology, 20% devotional practical application. In fact it is just the reverse, and Lucado, whether accidentaly or by design, makes some poor theological inferences. There are some endearing things, that along devotional lines will warm your heart. But overall, there are far better works to read if you truly want to know Christ, and be just like Him."
3,Prefer Ruby's Horror Efforts,"Being a big fan of Ruby Jean Jenson's horror writings, I recently read House at Rivers Bend, which was one of her earlier writings. This book is more of a Gothic Romance, not like the later horror books that she would write. While fans of this genre might enjoy this read, I found it a bit too far from my preferred type of reading. But, despite this, I plan on reading many more of Ruby's books as I feel that she is truely one of the most under appreciated horror authors around."
4,A fun find,"I got this book from the library and was fairly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It was fast paced, with suspense, intrigue and romance. The romance portions weren't romantic at all, but it could be because of the time period the book was written."
3,It Was Okay,"So unlike most of the barbie movies I have seen, I found this one a little difficult to follow and the kids got bored with the starting of the film and did not get interested really until the second half. I take issue with so much of the electric rock music in the movie since it is geared toward children, and prefer the more classic milder barbie films such as Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses, or Barbie the princess and the pauper."
2,Barbie & the Diamond Castle DVD,"The movie is what my 4 & 3-year old daughters wanted (they had seen it at a cousin's home). Unfortunately, the DVD sticks during several of the opening minutes and at the end. The seller requested a review too so I shared this info suggesting an exchange. Never heard back from them..."
1,Barbie and the Diamond Castle,cute movie and it keeps my granddaughter busy when I have to babysit. thanks Barbie
1,"Oh, my........","A is for atrocious. This is THE most dreadful movie, verging on beastly. A predictable, sorry story of weak, faltering friendship. The kids I babysat found it quite boring, other than the dragon with the long, white hair, who they found funny.Do not waste your precious time or money on this inferior film. Trust me."
1,very disatisfied,this was the worse exchange i have ever had w/amazon.com...never have i been so upset with a purchase...thats all i can say
3,Oh brother,"My daughter has enjoyed several Barbie movies and we have found them to be ok as far as story lines, music, etc. But this one... oh brother! The music is awful, the story is terrible and the characters are annoying. My daughter enjoys it but I plan to make it quietly disappear after the initial enthusiam wanes."
5,Thank you Daddy!!,"My daughter first saw this movie at a friend's house and has wanted the movie ever since. She even goes online to watch the YouTube of Kathryn McPhee singing the song ""Connected"" all the time. She may be 10, but still loves her Barbie movies!!"
1,Waste of money,My daughter loves barbie but this movie is scary and she had nightmares all weekend from watching it! It was a waste of my $10.
3,"I would still recommend it, not my kids favorite though","It is okay. My daughter still loves the Princess and the Pauper best of all the Barbie movies......she is very young, so that held her attention more than this.........but it is still good for most kids."
4,The twins liked this movie,"My twin granddaughters (4) watched the movie several times driving to Florida and back. They have most of the Barbie movies, but they still pick this one every few days. They especially like the pets."
5,My daughter loves it!,"My little one loves barbie movies, especially ones with puppies and lots of music. This is one of her favorites."
3,Different from classics,"My daughter and I love the Barbie movies. We even have one of the CD's. The animation is always so colorful, and I love the classic style themes of friendship and sacrifice. Diamond Castle has a great premise of loyalty to friends, good verses evil, and even a tame love story. I could do without the modern style music, however. These stories really target little children, and there are already ""older girl"" versions of Barbie. I hope this isn't a new trend for the Barbie princesses. I have been able to recommend these to conservative Christian friends, and I still will but I'd leave this one out. I am overall very please with the Barbie movies and think they are some of the greatest children's shows for ""little princesses""."
2,Barbie Diamond,The movie is scratched and it's hard to watch. I should of returned but I got to busy. I took a risk and it didn't pay off.
3,It's OK,"Here are my complaints:-storyline is weak, borderline ridiculous-supposed to be long ago, but music is modern-no classical music-barbie doesn't look like barbie......my kids almost didn't recognize her-what really happens at the end....not really sure...I just felt sad after watching this. There were no magical moments. It felt like they ran out of storylines.....like they chewed on a bunch of stories old & new & spit out this one. I noticed that they are starting to churn out these movies......and they are becoming like a show you could watch on tv .........BORING!I wish that mattel would read these reviews, and make the effort to return to the quality of the originals such as Rapunzel, Swan Lake, Princess & pauper & pegasus......otherwise start selling them at a lower price"
2,Disappointing. Painful music. Relieved my daughter didn't like it,"Thankfully we rented this movie in preparation for a snow storm. This is the first Barbie movie that I did not enjoy. I don't have high expectations for storylines. I just like to be able to relax with my kids while they enjoy a movie. However, this movie was painful to listen to. Wierd, since music was such a focal point in this movie. The songs were very shrill.Anyway, much to my relief my daughter said that she had changed her mind about wanting me to buy it for her."
1,Annoying,"This is about the worse barabie movie ever!!! I've seen all of the movies and they're all better than this junk! Too many annoying high-pitched songs in whih Barbie and Teresa think they sin soooooooo beautifully. They really do NOT!!! And what was with that stupid doll in a mirror. That was just stupid! To sum the whole movie up, it's just STUPID! I'm 10."
5,Barbie and the Diamond Castle DVD - Spanish,"SPANISH VERSION - Barbie and Teresa tell us the fairy tale story of Liana and Alexa, best friends who shared everything including their love of music. One day their simple lives change when they are given an enchanted mirror and befriend the girl trapped inside! To save their new friend, Liana and Alexa embark on a dangerous journey to the hidden Diamond Castle that will put their friendship to the test. But through the power of song and with the companionship of two adorable puppies, the girls face their challenges together and learn that friendship is the true treasure."
4,good buy,this movie is cute and it came here on time. its the perfect price for the perfect buy! every girl will love to have this movie
1,Uninspired,"Ocasionally there are truly awesome trance artists, but this isn't the case with this one. This music is only bearable if listened in the background, while doing something else. Listening to it directly is just plain boring. Make sure you listen to at least half of these tracks before buying the album."
3,Good Speakers,Speakers sounds real good. Great Bargin IMO. Buying another one for my old school. You have to break the speakers in because he sounds okay at first
4,speaker,i purchased the speaker for my grandson who lives with me and he liked it very much so i guess if he liked it then so do i. i was very satisfied with the speed of shipping. thank you
4,Good but not Great,This sub is pretty good. I don't think that it is the loudest sub you can get for your money but so far its lasted. I've had it for about a month now and use it every time I'm in the car. It can shake the car and give you a back massage. It's not as loud as my old Sony Explode speaker but that only lasted a few months. I have it hooked up to the same amp 1000 watt Sony amp. If it lasts for a while it would be worth it so far so good. Four stars for sound clarity minus a star for not being bone rattling.
3,not quite what i expected,"As I was looking for a one year calendar for my third child, I had pretty specific criteria. One such criteria was that there was space for a photo for each of the twelve months. The close-up of this calendar displayed what ended up being the LAST page- a large spae for a picture- which was not descriptive of each months page. I was a little disappointed when the calendar arrived and I realized the mistake. Just a word to the wise, for those who may be seeking the same features in a one-year calendar and may be mislead by this one."
1,I hate this thing,"First let me say, it's a hassle because you have to write in the dates of every month because it is all blank. Some may say this is nice but I found it very difficult to keep up with. I need the simplicity of one already made up ready to write in. The stickers are a nice addition. The thing that was the most frustrating is that there isn't enough pages to have the final month in order to write their first birthday or anything. There are only tweleve pages. That was a little frustrating to me. If I could go back I would have just used a real calendar. It is much simpler. I will give it credit for being cute and a nice keepsake."
3,"Good bood, but only if...","You're a Home Inspector or simply in search of picture after picture with little other detail other than technical information. If you are looking for advice on how to repair or fix items, DO NOT BUY this or other Carson Dunlop books in this series, or the $$$ - The Illustrated Home. Carson Dunlop is a firm out of Canada that does produce good materials for Home Inspectors, but these are not ""how to"" manuals, nor are these books good for the average home owner. The reviewer g_clarke is, in my view, clearly associated with Carson Dunlop and his or her review should be ignored - check out his/her other reviews, they are worded exactly the same for each book in this series. Kind of sad when people write misleading reviews to simply increase sales. On the positive - DO BUY this book if you are simply looking for very detailed technical information."
2,"All pictures, no text","Each page has a bunch of pictures, with a caption. No detail, no text. Disappointing."
3,White Trash Revisited,"I enjoyed reading the little excerpts of stories more than the recipes. The recipes are a repeat of the first book to a large degree only sized for a larger crowd.But even so, I love this cookbook. It is the stuff I was raised on even though I grew up in California where my parents were ""cotton pickers"".The food is still as good as any fancy restuarant with skimpy portions. At least you leave the table satisfied with this hearty fare."
3,WHITE TRASH COOKING,"A MUST FOR ANY COOK, I BOUGHT ALL THREE BOOKS, THE FIRST I THOUGHT WAS THE BEST 5 STAR, THE OTHER 2 ARE REPEATED PARTS OF VOLUME 1, WITH LESS PAGES"
4,Do it again.,"If you've seen #1, then this is more of the same. The stories are so good, you'll laugh out loud. The photographs are also great, though I prefer those in #1 by a smidgeon. Oh, yea, there are recipes in this one too. I like the ones that say, ""you can mess with this and it will turn out fine."" I'm not much of a cook, though my husband is."
1,There are more good singers than good songs ................,"He kicked on after this release because he has a great voice. But this is a bunch of leftover songs that no-one else wanted to record, and it would have killed the career of a lesser singer."
5,PART 1 OF A 2CD SET,There were two separate discs with different packages/covers that made up a set:Disc 1: catalog # A7293CD (CD5 plastic jewel case)1. Sex Type Thing (3:38)2. Piece Of Pie (5:28)3. Dead And Bloated - Live (4:53)4. Sex Type Thing - Live (4:01)Disc 2: catalog # A7293CDX (digipak)1. Sex Type Thing (3:38)2. Piece Of Pie (5:28)3. Wicked Garden - Live (4:26)4. Sin - Live (7:52)I have loaded the images of both CD's above.
4,It was a good value,"The costume met my expectations for the party I wore it to. I did not use the belt becaus it looked too cheap. Nor I did not use the boot covers. The size of the costume was accurate. I am 6'3"" around and the shirt sleeves were perfect size. The wrist ties became a pain by the end of the night because they kept sliding down. I would recomend this costume for the price."
2,Great value,"This costume is a great value. I bought it for one time use at a children's party. It is not the sturdiest construction, but is good enough and looks pretty good. I'm 6'3 and 250 lbs, the XL fit me fine.Update! After wearing the costume for two hours at the party the ""leather"" parts started to smell like old fish. It was gross! I would not buy another one!"
1,AWEFUL,WHAT A TERRIBLE COSTUME. SUPER CHEAP QUALITY AND MADE TO FIT A WATER BUFFALO! I'M 6' 185LBS AND THE MEDIUM IS HUGE! SENT IT BACK IMMEDIATELY...THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZONS RETURN POLICY
4,Good costume for a decent price,There are probably higher quality costumes out there but this one was perfet for a Halloween party. The material wasn't too see-through and didn't wrinkle. The boot covers were a little on the cheesy side but they worked. Get yourself a sword or a hook and you are ready for the party!
3,Want to be a pirate?,I am a pirate clown and this costume has served me well. The pants keep sliding down and it cost more than it could have. The costume shops that appear around Halloween all have this. You need other props like a cutlass and boots.
2,Extremely cheap material,"The costume looks very good, but it is incredibly cheaply made. I wore it one day to a pirate parade in Tampa, and I had to throw it away after that. As soon as I went to put it on, the material was falling apart on me. The laces on the cuffs broke off, and the straps on the pants came off. There was no way to tighten the pants and they kept falling down. There are also no pockets at all, so someone else had to hold my wallet and keys for me."
4,Survived the night!,"Good costume, survived the party so it served it's purpose well...;) The size matrix is a bit confusing, medium size is about 36"" waist. Luckily the pants have a kind of a hook which you can attach to the shirt for protection against accidental indecent exposure."
4,Good Value,"A good value for a costume. Bought it last minute for a Saturday party and everything that came with it worked out. Ordered a large whcih is normal for me (6""1 185lbs) and it fit fine. The belt is pretty much crap, but I wore shorts underneath anyway so the pants stayed up on their own."
4,good for 1 time use for sure!,"I really loved this costume for my husband who doesn't dress up EVER! He was excited to put it on and really got a kick out of all the little ""extras"". I don't think we will use it again so it was the perfect price for a one time use item. Really simple and fun!"
4,Perfect for Pirate Night,"I needed a pirate costume for Pirates in the Carribean night on our Disney Cruise and this was perfect. It was comfortable and thin for the summer. It took up little space in my luggage. The ""belt buckle"" is a piece of leather-like plastic that doesn't hold it's shape very well. It was good enough for me though. I decided against using the headband and eye patch. You'll need you're own black shoes to go with the boot toppers.Overall, it looked good, was priced reasonably, and was comfortable to wear during the summer!"
4,Perfect for the Occasion,I took the advice of the other reviews and ordered this one size smaller. It fits great. The belt is a little lame. The shirt looks great and I do suggest having someone help with the cuffs. I am wearing another pair of pants under the costume. This way you can keep your wallet and phone on you with out notice. I am also a big fan of safety pins to keep your boot covers up. Great product for the price.
5,"Fantastic costume, Great price.","As everyone has said, the costume runs bigger so I ordered a medium for my husband who normally wears a bigger medium to a large. The pants are kind of short but the boot covers make up for that by covering the bottom of the pants and over your shoe. The shirt looks great, the bandana is nice, and the wrist strappy things were a nice touch. The belt is a little flimsy but whatever. It's a thin costume but not so thin that you can't party and move around as you please. My husband wore a t-shirt and normal black pants underneath just to be safe. He wore it all day and it's ready for another wear next year, it held up well. I just hung it up a few days before to let some of the wrinkles fall out. This is a pretty complete costume for a fantastic price. Highly recommended."
4,Good Purchase,For the cost the costume was good for the occasion! The material and quality was also good for the cost and I'm sure I'll use it again for a costume party in the future!
3,"Better watching the movie, but nice to hear remembering the scene...","The cd is well produced and recorded, but if don't know about the movie and is not a huge fan of indian music do not buy it!The movie called ""The Rising"" is fantastic and when the music is played among the scenes You will feel a compulsion to buy the music like I did, but if did not watch that You may not like it.Special atention on the 2nd and 4th tracks, they are certainly the best.Paulo Vitor."
5,Big Help in Losing Weight,"As a long time successful Weight Watcher member, the LightFull Smoothie is invaluable in the weight loss journey. It has 6 grams of fiber so is filling and the whole drink is only one point. I use it as a meal replacement along with a serving of fruit. That would be only two points for a meal. I use it especially when I know that eating out or other meal situations (potlucks) would put over my daily point allowance. The flavor is superb, tastes like a rich dessert."
5,very tasty and filling,I use this product for my replacement meal when I work in the evenings. This is very easy and quite tasty. If I could pour it over ice it would be even better.
4,Great light and filling snack,I really enjoyed these Lightful beverages. Buying them on Amazon saved me some cash too. I really liked Strawberry the best. Blend it it with some frozen strawberries and banana and BAM! you have an instant smmothie. The chocolate was really good with a banana and some peanut butter. The vanilla is great with everything else. They are best served cold. If you are on WW these are totally awesone 1 point snack!
5,Tasty & Satisfying,These give a nice satisfying taste of chocolate without blowing your diet. They are great mixed with crushed ice.
3,Am I the only one??,"I have to say, when I first tried these (Peach and Dutch Chocolate), I was amazed at such great taste, for so much fiber, protein and so few calories. I bought 4 cases! However, I soon noticed a weird affect. I started to experience gastro-intestinal discomfort about 20 minutes into my sipping (usually takes me about an hour to consume one, they are THAT thick). It's not a fun thing. Now, I am a vegetarian, and quite used to a high-fiber diet, so I don't know what this is a response to. Maybe because I drink them on an empty stomach? Well, I have 4 cases to figure it out. I still recommend this product, if you don't have this little side-effect. Definately try one or two before you invest."
3,gassy,"made me gassy. filled me up like a cup of yogurt would, for about 5 minutes. tastes good (like a chocolate Ensure) though. Rather expensive for not really measuring up to its purpose of ""filling you up"" in between meals."
1,Dont' believe the hype!,I thought that this product looked interesting so I read the reviews regarding this product and made my purchase based on that. I have to say that based on these ratings I was disappointed in the taste. It's almost indescribable. Because of the chicory root it has a slight coffee taste which is fine if you are expecting a mocha but this is supposed to be chocolate fudge and it is only slightly sweet with a weird taste. I had to doctor it up by adding fat-free milk and a little sweetener to improve the taste. I also poured it over ice to chill it. I have to say I would not buy this again and my kids didn't like it either. If you are able to try it or buy it in a single container do that first rather than ordering a case of it. I now have 11 containers that my family does not want to drink and is only going to waste.
5,Delightfully decadent chocolate!!,This smoothie is so yummy! If you are looking for something that is healthy but doesn't taste like you are cutting the sweets-here it is!
5,Excellent product!!,"I've tried every diet drink on the market (CANNOT stand Slim-fast or WW smoothies) and this beats them all for a filling snack. I do not experience the problems some others mention, and neither does my 9 year old, but we eat a fairly healthy diet overall. And I do feel satisfied - much more so than after drinking a protein shake or anything else liquid. The taste is excellent - chocolate is my favorite but I have tried them all. My child loves the strawberry flavor most."
5,LOVE this stuff - great for Weight Watchers,"Great FILLING 1 pt snack for Weight Watchers. I didn't really care for the Latte or Strawberry flavors, but LOVE the chocolate!"
2,Good but gassy,"It was good to read the other reviews and read that others have had similar reactions. I thought it was just me. Love the taste of these drinks, particularly the peach, and I was hopeful since I thought it would make a good filling snack, and even a quick breakfast drink if I'm running late. But the last few times that I've had them, my stomach has been gurgling for several hours from the excess gas, and I've been in pain. While I like them, the discomfort outweighs any benefits. Maybe it's just some digestive systems and not everyone would experience it, but for me....uggghhhhhh!"
2,Great Snack!!,"They taste great! They really are satisfying! They are so low in Calories! I would definitely buy these again. The only downsides - a little pricey, must be really cold, or they don't taste as good."
3,Smoothie?,"This is more like a chocolate milk product than a smoothie. However, I have seen reviewers state that they added ice etc. I thought it had a weird aftertaste. It did fill me up but my stomach felt bloated after I drank it. I might try another flavor (if I can find a a local grocery store. However, I will not buy in bulk again."
5,Delicious product,"Lightfull smoothies are a great alternative to lunch or a snack. The best part is the flavor is great, without that nasty nutrasweet aftertaste."
5,"Low calorie, tasty, filling - a good find","My cousin introduced me to these drinks, they sell them at our local health food store. For a smoothie that is tasty and satisfying, this is a good candidate. I like the chocolate, it does not have that aftertaste or that undertaste that I have gotten while drinking either the WW smoothies or Atkin's Advantage."
4,Quite tasty - a no-guilt treat,"I bought a case of the chocolate fudge flavor and have been quite pleased - it's a very portable, low calorie, high fiber snack. It says it tastes best when chilled, but I've drank mine at room temperature without any loss of flavor. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to ""fill me up"" as advertised - not any more than drinking, say, a normal glass of milk. But it's very tasty and I would recommend it for anyone with a sweet tooth."
5,Great Book!,"This book is great! Whether your a father, a mother, or just a 14 year old (like me!) you'll love it, and laugh your head off. It's one of the funniest things I've ever read!"
2,A good effort,"I heard the title track on the radio when this album was released several years ago, and bought the CD. Over the years, I have listened to it now and then and it has kind of grown on me. It is not the best jazz album ever done, but it is not the worst either. The problems of the album have more to do with production values than anything else.I am not sure I understand people who only offer negative criticism because there are always postitive things about someone's art and this album is no exception. Maybe it is difficult for some people to appreciate the courage it takes for an artist to create and to risk. Perhaps it is easier to criticize, than to praise."
3,"Not great, but pleasing to the ear,",The songs and the voice are pleasing. I would listen to the entire CD more than once. I've heard lot's worse. With improved musicians and production She'll be much better.
1,"the sad, sad, state of today's jazz.",Another fine example of someone with far more luck (and not much of that either) than talent. Letvin bleeds all depth from her songs with a flacid voice and weak lyrics.
1,I think I've seen + HEARD enough!,Lazy and grating on the nerves generally speaking. Ms. Letven shows how the West Coast Jazz scene is not only dead but is starting to stink.
4,Big Book,"There are plenty of ideas in this book, although many of them are rather ordinary (go to the movies, walk in the park). But the sheer volume makes it certain that you will find at least a couple dozen that will work for you.I would also recommend for more creative and unusual date to go to 300creativedates. com -- I loved what I found there and more importantly so has my girlfriend."
2,From the sublime to the rediculous,"I thought about returning this book but its fairly cheap and by the time you pay shipping....The suggestions in this book fall into 3 categories. (1) the obvious: movie, window shopping, dinner, etc., (2) the silly (lunch at a hot dog stand--do you really need instructions?) and (3) the ones you wish, like share a bath. Hint: if you and your date are taking baths together this book is superfluous.Of course there is the usual, film festival, wine festival, bike ride and so on. But you can get this out of the sunday paper."
5,Art of snow,"Just an amazing high production film of Xtreme snow boarding in some of the most inaccessible and beautiful places on this planet. I prefer skiing to snow boarding but this is a must have video, with breath taking scenery and great airial shots. I would have cut out the shooting and blowing up bits in the film, a bit Sarah Palin, and replaced it with filming of the wild. But a great film and great music."
4,Bought this as a gift - good decision,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my brother, who is a helicopter pilot. The snowboarding runs are amazing, as always, but some of the stuff the helicopter pilots pull off is just as incredible. Travis Rice et al do a great job, and I'm glad they brought in Jeremy Jones for some runs."
5,Great Video,"This video is more of an adventure snowboarding video instead of That's It That's All which was more of a progression video.This video will take you to places that other people have never been snowboarding or skiing. It is a great look at what is out there and what the riders run into along the way. Yes there is some progression as well, but for me it is about the adventure in this video."
5,Wow! Stuns me again and again!,"I know next to nothing about snowboarding, but I do love mountains and flight, and helicopters are cool. When you see these guys drifting down mountains of massive scale, and touching the snow, then simply falling sometimes over a hundred feet and just keep going, and then do some tricks mid-run, it's just . . . wow. The music tracks alone are worth getting this Bluray set. I watch this again and again.Update 10/17/2012 I watch this several times a month, sometimes running mute while practicing music, sometimes just to hear the soundtrack. And when someone else gets to see this film, they're astounded. This is a mesmerizing experience, and may someday qualify as literature - I really think so. Please recommend it to your friends -- it's worth the purchase, easily."
5,The Art of Flight rips!,T Rice and his snowboarding buddies have yet again pushed the boundaries on what can be physically achieved on a snowboard. These guys are really pushing the envelope. In addition to the amazing riding the cinematography of this film blows away anything I've seen in a ski/snowboard flick before. The soundtrack includes some really great songs too. A must see!
5,Best Snowboard Movie Ever,The production quality on this is amazing. This is seriously the prettiest snowboard movie I have ever seen. They do awesome runs in some incredible places and it is put together incredibly well. My friends that don't even like snowboarding like this movie.
5,Great movie,Best snowboard movie made in a long time. I've watched it at least 20 times so far. Buy it now!
5,"DAMN Good Production, Cam work,...... ALL round Great Movie","Best Movie, I have seen to date, I would highly recommend this to anybody, skier or snowboarder. Do your self a favor on this one an Buy it."
3,Worth the Price for Track #6 Alone!,"Being a Six Degrees junkie, I picked this up cheap at a used CD store and got my money's worth. A couple of the tracks are too repetitive for my taste (Tracks 3 and 5), but the wonderful Dzihan and Kamien are represented with two slamming cuts. The At Jazz Remix of their classic ""After"" is made for trance heaven, and this is the only place you can get their song ""B-Movie,"" which has a wicked bass line and slamming groove. This song could fill a dance floor in a heartbeat, and justifies the purchase price. Tracks 7, 8, and 9 were more for chilling, not for dancing, but there are a few cuts here that will get your next party off to a great start!"
2,slightly disappointed,"i love the six degrees collections, and i love dance music (deep house, funk, and hard techno)-- so when i saw this i thought it'd be the perfect cd for me. unfortunately, the majority of these cds (either in their original form or the same form) are on other six degrees collections-- and the originals are way better. adding a BOOM-chi-BOOM-chi-BOOM-chi does not turn bebel gelberto into a tech-house classic. many songs i find annoying and skip over, but i still pop it in my cd player every once awhile so it still gets 2 stars."
3,Six Degrees of Motion,This is a great little ditty of a compilation. The Six Degrees camp put together a nice ecletic mix of artists to groove too.
5,"A book for every Beginner Harp player,",Easy to follow instructions.Well laid out.Cd contains the practice notes you can replay and practice until you are able to match the tone and clairity.A must for all who wish to learn and play .
5,Fabulous!,"Purchase was smooth as silky butter. Arrived on time, in full fledged flawless furbish condition. Thank you so much, this book and cd are working wonders for my wailing woes!"
1,REALLY disappointed,"After reading some of the prior reviews of this book, I ordered it. Boy was I disappointed. First off, the cave man characters WERE just as obnoxious as everyone else mentioned in their reviews. Don't know what author was thinking to include that. Wasn't cute, or funny. Just dumb. Second, I found his diagrams and tabs confusing and frustratng to try to figure out. (I finally gave up and started reading the other harmonica book that I ordered at the same time as this one.It is MUCH better.)I haven't played the CD that came wih this book yet, maybe that will turn out to be the one good thing about ordering this book and save me from thinking that I wasted my money."
1,Just plain bad,"I bought this based on all the good reviews but must admit that I personally find the book just plain bad - a theme that is sadly carried forward with the accompanying CD.As an absolute beginner, with hardly any musical talent, I have learned more from YouTube than this book/CD combo.I might get more use out of this purchase once I have progressed a bit more but to be perfectly honest, I really do doubt it."
2,mediocore,This isn't the best book to learn from. If you are mentally challeneged then it is fine. Choose a better Harmonica book like Paul butterfield's or adam Gassow's.
3,Its ok,IMHO This is better than blues harmonica for dummies It gives the complete blues scale with the 6 blow down and the 9 blow upgood coverage on the included cd. Has kind of a cheesy story line that the book follows but i think that is kind of cool. I have learned way more from youtube than from this or blues harmonica for dummies. Look up adam gussow or jason ricci follow there instructions and boom you will be playing cool riffs and songs in no time. I wish that I would have ordered adams gussow beginner harmonica course before i got this book then i would have never wasted my money on this book.
3,too much nonsense in this book,"This book contains so much extra nonsense it was rather annoying to read. The book describes itself as containing, ""a world of harp knowledge, songs, stories, lessons, etc.. . The bad thing is the ""stories"" were some nonsense about ficitional characters running around in caveman times and their experiences with music and the harmonica. The book does contain useful info, mixed in with the foolish stories, making it twice as long as it needs to be. I did however find the included CD somewhat helpful. I have a pretty good music background and was looking for something a little less, ""age 8 and under"", I guess."
2,Cheesy Story detracts from the message,"This book contains some good information but the information revolves around a silly cheesy cave man / Adam & Eve story that really starts to become irritatingly annoying after the first page. In fact, the silly story is so irritating that it detracts from the real message and information. If you were to remove the story the information could be written in a book with far few pages and much less irritation. The accompanying CD is ok with its two channel ability but even that can be improved a bit."
3,"Good techniques, bad text",The techniques described in the book are very useful for the beginner. The whole cave-man angle is cheesy and takes away from the instruction.
2,"okay, more of a documentry","i thought this was going to show like actual gang fights and stuff like that, but instead they mostly just interview these two guys at a park. kinda boring. don't judge a book by it's cover.the cover looks awsome, but the tape isn't that good."
3,"Good book, but old","The book is very good teaching Particles, but there are better tutorials online. It was written for Maya 2.5. So, if your using Maya 3 or 4, there's parts changed.I was required to buy this book for a class at RIT, I recommend anyone who is required to buy the book for a class or any sorts to see if someone else has the book. Because, spending money on an old tutorial book and getting frustrated is a no no, when your trying to learn a new program.Hopefully, there will be an updated book in the future, now Maya has become a powerful particle tool."
2,Not for professionals,"Early on in my career I bought this book hoping that it would give me some technical chops. It didn't. Now, to be fair, I bought it back in 2001, but still, I distinctly remember not liking it and thinking it was a waste of money. Why? I can't recall, but from what I understand there's plenty of other good books on Maya and mel out there."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a good overview of the fundamentals in technical animation. A good link in both basics and practical production. If the images are in color, that will be even more wonderful!"
1,Rushed in....,"As an average Maya user,I definitely agree on this comment ""rushed, incomplete, cashing in on Maya user"" Seen better, done better..."
4,Sad...sad...sad!,"I have not read anything like this book. It's very emotional and draining but such a good story. I felt so bad for the hero and the heroine but in a way I was happy that at the end of the story, a legacy was left and remembered. Up until now I still feel sad and kind of melancholy."
4,Finding old books,"I received this product in a timely fashion. I had looked for this product for two years before finding it on Amazon.com, Thank you for having a great selection.I love Historical Romance, Native American Romance, Western Romance.Thank youMary Smith"
5,"Fast paced, romantic Native American historical novel","The reader will stay up all night to read this one. The characters Sarah and Golden Eagle will find their way into your heart and mind . I've received a letter from the author announcing book 2 in the White series, ""White Wolf"" has been sold . I can hardly wait for the next all night read !."
3,Fairly stock standard Warhammer 40K sci-fi,"Fairly stock standard Warhammer 40K sci-fi that left me feeling a little unsatisfied. Apart from a couple of clashes with the Eldar, I felt the humans were grossly outclassed by the Ultramarines. More importantly, the plot and story tries to be clever but is fairly well telegraphed in advance. Character development was pretty much non-existent, with the saving grace of Adept Barzano whose transformation I loved.At the end I was left wondering - (trying not to reveal too many spoilers here) if the evil nemesis had that particular end goal in mind, why all the political machinations, manipulation and subterfuge? Everything else would have been inconsequential if he had just gone for the end goal, and he would probably have pulled it off as well. Of course, then the book would only be 1 chapter long"
5,"New Hero of the Warhammer 40,000 world","If you have never checked the Warhammer 40,000 world out. Boy, are you missing the boat. Do you like storys of mystery, battles of Good-vs-evil, and war?? Then these books will be your Fix!! This Book is about the new captain of the Ultramarines 4th company( too see how he became Capt. see the book of short storys ""Words Of Blood"" and check out the short story ""Chains of Command"" ). There is a spaceship battle,Space Marines-Dark Eldar-Necrons, hand to hand combat, governmental corruption, civil uprising, and a attempt to awaken a ancient evil...""The Nightbringer""."
4,Bringer of Darkness,"Excellent introduction and character description by Graham. As usual he builds up the story right untill the end, keeping you guessing what is going to happen next. If you are interested in the Eldar this book describes their influence within Imperium and how much more advanced their technology is compared to Mankind."
2,"Mildly Funny, Mostly sophomoric","I *am* an academic--in the humanities, no less--and I found this only mildly funny. At times it is clever and interesting, at times just juvenile. Most of the time, the authors are trying too hard. And I never once laughed out loud (although Anne Fadiman claims that she did in her blurb on the back). This book is primarily a parody of the type of literary criticism that is already a parody of itself."
3,How are you supposed to compare sizes???,"These function well as airtight storage. As far as utility and choices of size and shape, this is a great buy, especially for the price.HOWEVER... They are also quite annoying. I wanted to use the larger of two similar sized containers, so I turned over the one I was holding and it said, ""1.3 Pints."" Then I asked my wife what size the one she was holding was. ""3 cups."" I checked another one. It was marked ""24 oz.""How the heck are you supposed to make an intelligent size choice with those options???*****Final Thoughts*****These containers work pretty well for utility, but they aren't high on convenience!"
2,Problem w/ item but Kitchen Etc does not respond,"Bought such as I've had same/same sturdy product for 7 plus years but when I received this set, some of the tops did not fit on the bases (especially #11). In fact, one top (not a #11) had a yellow stain that sure as heck looked like a microwave use problem. I emailed Kitchen Etc and ***NEVER*** received a response and ergo I'd be embarassed to send such as a gift from a QUALITY perspective (otherwise bang for buck). I super object to NO response from a vendor. At any rate, my old Rubbermaids of the same style are still - many years later - performing well (other than tomato stains) and I would recommend Rubbermaid products from ANY vendor OTHER than KItchen Etc."
3,Gift for my Wife,She has read the book and she really liked the material covered in this book. i have not read it but she said it was good.
4,when the street lights come on,i got this for my momma we were watching the movie and the songs that came on had her thinking back when she used to have the fish frys and the card games and the get togethers my moms could have been a promoter or something cause when she used to throw a get together every one would be there i remember my mom waking me and my sister up to dance for the people i used to hate that hey i say cop it there was a song on the movie that was not on the soundtrack by general kane so i'm looking for it now all i have to do is find the name of it first then i'll be straight
3,Cute but way too big,"This sandal looked so perfect online. I have no complaint about the color or the material...they were just much too big. Definitely not true to size. I am normally a 7.5 or 8 and ordered a 7 based on some warnings in other reviews I had read about the sizing. When I received and tried them on, i think I still could have gone down another half size without compromising fit...which means they are WAY TOO BIG! A 7.5 should not be able to fit into a 6.5 sandal."
3,Flashes of brilliance.,"For a movie that focuses on pilots, fire-jumpers and fire the cockpit SFX are truly badly done and almost feel 1970's. That aside the basic storyline of a hotshot pilot who feels he's caused the death of some fire-jumper friends and drops out of circulation, only to return on discovery of a 'super fire'. Cliched but made more believable with excellent fire SFX.The fire shelter scene is especially intense and well done while the rest of the movie is watchable with flashes of brilliance (sometimes literally!)."
5,The Music from Dark Shadows Lives On,"This music collection is a must have for fans of the classic television series ""Dark Shadows."" Robert Cobert (""Winds of War,"" ""War and Remembrance,"" and others) composed the music for the series as well as two related films. Eighteen selections by Cobert are included in this book which is arranged for piano, with guitar chords and vocal lines where available.This is one of the most comprehensive music books from a TV series I have ever seen. The arrangements are not only well written, but unlike many songbooks, these arrangements sound as much like the original recorded music as possible.Bonus sections include a photo gallery, a DS discography, and DS lyrics."
3,Learning Tool,"The tape was not what I expected it to be. I was looking for it to show the building of the temple. It only lasted for 28 minutes by, the time the introduction was done it was almost over. Not enough information was involved especially if you are a new Christian and want to get more understanding of the Bible."
1,Not So Good,"My husband watched it once and threw it in the trash. He was going to use it for his church group but considering for the amount of actual information it, it wouldn't have been worth the time it took for the group to watch it. There is much better stuff on Solomon's temple out there. On the plus,the photography and music is nice."
3,"Interesting to read, but not all that usefull","I found the book very interesting to read, and some of the tips on roleplaying were very usefull. Unfortunatly some of the new rules seem pointless, like the section on reputation. Why do we need rules about a Bards reputation? A Bards reputation should be role-played, not determined by a number on a character sheet. Overall I thought it was interesting, but you can probably get by without it."
4,Bests Kits of any of the Handbook Supplements,"I recommend this book highly if you use kits. I have several of the handbooks and this one truly has the best kits of any of them. My players use to never play bards, but after getting this book we always have one in our groups.If you don't like kits this book proably isn't for you. However, it does have a good chapter on roleplaying bards as well as optional rules for a reputation system that is pretty interesting. There is a section on music which has a list of instruments with pictures and short descriptions. There is also a couple of new proficiencies, spells, magic items; however, I didn't find these particularly useful."
5,2nd grade leapster game. My 2 older kids love this game...,"My daughter who is 6 and my son who is 7 LOVES this game! They like the idea that education can be fun. They ask for this system more than there game boy and believe me that is alot! lol It teaches things like suffixes and double digit math, and lots more. Lots of fun! When they start playing they don't want to stop..."
1,"Did not receive. However, It said that I HAVE RECEIVE!!! (??????)","I did not receive my purchase. Today is August, 03 and I did not receive them. I HAVE PAID BUT NOT RECEIVED MY PRODUCTS.UPS said that it left the products on my porch. And I said that I did not receive. In which one of us (UPS or I) do you think Adorama Camera and Amazon going do believe?Someone has stolen my product on my porch?I was at home the day the UPS said it left them there. So (??????)...Now I am without my money and my products.NEVER MORE AMAZON.COMIT IS NOT SAVE, FOR SURE.WHY THE UPS GUY DID NOT RING THE BELL??????BRENO."
5,The Best Cookbook for the Dorm!,"While I have been cooking for years, I didn't really know how to make complicated dishes without a true oven and stovetop. Even the most basic information helped me brush up on my techniques. THE PARTY RECIPES ARE ESPECIALLY GREAT!"
4,"Finally, good tasting toothpaste for sensitive teeth!!","Many years ago, the Arm & Hammer baking soda toothpaste for sensitive teeth I was using was discontinued. I bought up a case of it, and mourned when it was all used up. I haven't been happy with the taste of any of the alternatives. Disgusted, I was searching for another brand and came across this. For some reason, I checked the ingredients, and there was the baking soda, unadvertised! What a difference. It is too soon to tell whether it whitens my teeth or is effective with sensitivity (no problems so far), but my mouth feels really clean and my breath is so much fresher. The baking soda may take getting used to for some, but I love it. I'm telling you that it is worth buying a small tube to try.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't yet know if it lives up the claims of whitening. If it does, it will definitely be a 5 star rating."
3,Disappointed,"I eagarly anticipated the release of Lynn Armistead McKee's new book and was disppointed. Although not completely disappointed, I just think that Spirit of the Turtle woman was a much MUCH better novel and that this one fell short of my expectations. I found the read quite easy, but lacking in depth. I just could not seem to form a bond with any of the characters and found the plot superficial. I will still read books by this author, but I won't eagarly await them as I had this one."
2,The book description kinda rings a bell.,"This book is the same as the rest of the far better works the author has written, only with different names and location. If this the first book you have read by McKee it will be enjoyable, but for the rest of us fans, this is a boring read."
2,"A mere gathering of musings, indeed!","I was disappointed , I couldn't get over the fact that the title of this book is not totally about solitude . The author went into town to buy goods, she spoke to the postman on occasion and ups delivery service,.She had access to a telephone with a tape message machine and access to the internet. I believe she spoke to the neighbor,as well.Internet access-- now. thats a connection!Her musing were boring, They were very subjective--the authors experience.I felt forced as the reader to look into her life and her experiences and interpretations. Such a heavy title , not represented well throughout the book.The fact that she had access to the internet, a phone and T.V. by the way, she would listen to the news and whatever,strips the imagination of desparateness, survival and immediate thoughts and feelings. Perhaps pure reflectiveness without connectiveness would be more poignant.Nothing to ponder or to learn from this book."
2,Not very good...,"This was the case I picked up when I got my iPod to protect it from scratches. I've learned that there is no point - your iPod is inevitably going to get scratched, they are ridiculously prone to this.But, this case does little to help. It doesn't protect the corners of the unit, which is a minor annoyance. What really isn't good at all though is that the loose stitching and hard pattern that keeps the screen protector in place scratches the front of the iPod!!!! This is NOT very impressive for a utility that's supposed to do the opposite!As well as this, you can't use your iPod in a dock while it's in this. But I think that may be true of most if not all cases."
2,there are errors in this book,"My son likes looking at the pictures and the flaps. However, it reads a little rough - something is off with the sentence strucutre. Also, there are errors in the printing: fishES is not the plural of fish and they connfuse the words puffins and penguins throughout the book. Confusing! I am surprised at this coming from such a reputable company."
4,My son will actually sit still for this one.,"My 11-month-old loves this book, and loves lifting all the flaps. The flaps are a bit flimsy as others have mentioned. But so far, we have not ripped any. The story is cute, written with a cadence that I think he finds engaging. We read every day, and this one is one of his favorites (along with all the Karen Katz books)."
4,My mother's opinion,"Well, I don't use this product, but my mom does... I actually purchased this for her. She is absolutely happy with this product... she loves it! She uses it all the time... :)"
3,Pretty sweet soundtrack....for television,"I absolutely loved this cd, but there aren't many songs on it and a couple of them NEED to be skipped. However, it's worth it to buy this album just for the sake of a few choice tracks. ""Here and Now"" by Letters to Cleo quickly became my fave song of the mid-90's upon hearing it's confusion of a chorus. ""Baby I Can't Please You"" and ""That's Just What You Are"" are perfect for any woman needing to vent about that ridiculously clueless guy. ""I'm Jealous"" could probably hit home with any listener, we've all felt that way at some point. ""How Was It For You"" is an amazing tune by James which should not be ignored. Buy this cd! It's worth it!!!"
2,Disappointing!,"I'm a Melrose fan, I own Melrose Jazz and the two books written by C. E. Moore. This CD is awful and does not include the MP theme. You can survive without it."
3,Maybe you need to be from Boston,"I'm not sure why--because the show took place in LA--but three of the songs are by artists from Massachusetts (like me). Ten-plus years on, I still enjoy hearing Letters to Cleo stepping up to the Big Leagues by having a song on this soundtrack. And the Aimee Mann song is simple and gorgeous."
4,A great mix of alternative to flow with the show!,This CD has many artists that no one had ever heard of until now. And their vocals and lyrics should speak for themselves!
2,out of theme,"I return this CD to the [store], really disgusted. I don't find in it the theme of Melrose Place television series when is supposed to be there. I know that many people suffer thatsame bad experience. But the worst thing is...where I can find it?.... I apreciate the information like many others. I am a fan of Melrose Place series and I hope that somebody can tell me at least which is the group that plays on it. In that way I wil try to find something about their music....I will appreciate...thanks."
3,Simply a mediocre film,"Boris Karloff is one of my favorite movie stars, but this film's weak script wasted the actor's talents. The stale story seemed to be a re-hash from other stereotypical mad scientist films. I recommend renting this film rather than buying it."
5,Great Devotional Book,"In ""The Only Holiest"" Walter Price brings some strong devotional thoughts to Isaiah's vision from Isa 6. The book is a reminder that our life is not to be lived selfishly, but in pursuit of pleasing God. In many ways, it is a ""throw back"" book. It has the familiar feel of books produced by authors like Tozer or Torrey.The book is easy to read and well worth the investment of time and money."
5,Good product,It's always what I expect. I have used this product for years. It has meet my needs. It is a good producr
4,Totally 80s,"Given that this CD was recorded in the 80s, I guess you can't really fault it for featuring the style of opera singing that was popular then, and it was worth buying anyway since it is the only recording of this beautiful opera available. If you're into obscure baroque operas, this would be a good one to add to your collection. And although the singers cast in the primo roles aren't the ones I would have chosen, Daniela Dessi as Sabina and Lucia Mazzaria as Aquilio perform very well in those roles. Susanna Anselmi is also good as Adriano."
2,Not Recommended,"I bought this book because I thought is was ""College Physics"" by Sears. Well, it isn't. This looks, feels and reads like a high school textbook - if you're looking for a serious, academic-level introduction to physics, then don't buy this. Its full of pictures and ""real life"" examples that are intended to spare the student any effort and save him/her from abstract thought. Much is lost because of this, and we're left with a bunch of pictures and stories about the authors' flying hobby.Don't buy this, please, I regret it everytime I see it sitting uselessly next to the open copy of the Sears book I loaned from the library."
3,24 Hours With Sisqo (VHS),As a fan of sisqo's i was really disappointed. He came off to me as a very igotistical airhead. He has caught the world eye with the Thong Song but he has been basking in it too long. The music was the best part of the entire doucumentary. I wish he could have had some better graphics or not as much thong. I think his success has went entirely to boost his ego. Better luck next time.
4,Great Jazz,"Super album! I think it's his best by far, much better than ""Caravan of Dreams"". ""Drive by Night"" is a classic and one of my all time favorites and reason enough to buy this CD."
3,a great insight into an industry where you can clearly see the damaged goods,"This documentary is not well done, however depicts the disturbing industry an inner workings of the scum bag losers that ""produce""this stuff, and the "" clearly"" damaged women that revelle themselves in it."
4,Interesting look at an interesting character!,"Annabel Chong gang-banged her way to the top of the porn industry by having sex with 251 guys in 10 hours. Did she do it to make a feminist statement, for the money, or because she simply enjoyed the act itself? The film explores all the possibilities and more.This documentary is more about the person behind the act other than the actual act itself. Annabel is quite an interesting character. At times she comes across as highly intelligent, and other times she appears to be highly sensitive, fragile, and self-destructive.The doumentary is presented through a serious of interviews and outtakes, some of which can be pretty disturbing.The parts in which Annabel demonsrates her techniques for self mutiliation, as well as her mother in Singapore discovering what her daughter has been doing in America for a living are particularly gut-wrenching.A very intriguing look at a this multi-faceted / multi-dimensional character and woman.Recommended!"
5,An Important Film,"I agree with the other reviewers that this movie could have been more - I would have liked more of an interview to get inside her head. Nontheless, I'm not aware of any other movies that portray the porn industry in such a straightforward manner; if it leaves a lot of questions, at least it raises them."
5,Amazon Review,Excellent service - shipment was received prior to the outline given and it was in great condition. Thank you for the speedy service!
5,I introduced Eldridge Cleaver to the Church ..,I know a little about this subject .. I was with Eldridge in the Church Office building when he met Elder Ezra Taft Benson .. this is my opinion .. we know this .. that Sunday is the most segregated day in America .. I believe that it could be that the church members were not ready for the blacks to have the priesthood .. and it was the Lord's priority at the time to keep the church together rather than allow the priesthood to all ..but I know that there is not any official doctrine .. scriptural or other as to why it was restricted in those years .. all opinions are conjecture .. or revelation to individuals perhaps ..
4,Very insightful and resourful book by Huggins,"Huggins' book, ""A Son of Ham Under the Convenant,"" is very insightful and resourful. Above all, it reflects how painstakingly the author has sought after the answers to the quest of his own lineage and the misconceptions around it that have permeated for centuries. His dedication to and insights on the subject paid off. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and am anxiously waiting for more works from him. Great work, Huggins!!!"
3,decent,"The quality of materials and construction is decent. The best feature is the sturdy padding. Your computer is well protected.Unfortunately, the casing was too small for my 15"" T60p with a 9 cell battery. The zipper barely closes. Obviously, it was not designed for this form factor. If you have a smaller screen or a smaller battery, it should fit.Don't expect heads to turn as you walk by carrying this. The appearance is strictly utilitarian."
5,My Birds Love It!,"I ordered this dry egg food for my finches and gave it to them for the first time today. I don't think I've ever seen all of my RCCBs in the feeding cup at the same time. All of the finches love it. There are instructions on feeding options (dry/wet/variety,etc). I see that it's a product of Germany. This bag is not made to contain the food after opening so have a strong ziploc or other container ready when you open it. Will buy again!!!!"
3,Missing deep cover,"The only reason that I bought this cd is because the deep cover track ; what a surprise for me that the song doesn't come with this version of the cd , wtf!!!! Disappointed , please don't get me wrong i still thinking that is a great cd , it's just missing my favorite track"
5,A class act indeed,"This is a very visual account of the life of one of the greatest decorators of our time. Billy Haines started out as a silent movie actor and when he refused to keep his sexuality in the closet he was fired, forcing him to change careers - and thank goodness. Schifando & Mathison take us on a journey, via photos, sketches, and other images, through the life of Haines and the evolution of his personal style. His classic interiors, which often included a touch of chinoiserie, a unique custom lamp, low chairs, quilted fabric upholstery, and other unique pieces will never go out of style."
3,Joseph's wife,I waited over a year to purchase this book because of the price. I enjoyed examining the room designs and wished there was more information about the decisions Mr Haines made in choosing the objects.
2,Ehh...,"Only gets 2 stars from me because it's not overpowering. It smells like a faint bathroom spray. Not a very pretty floral combination, and I'm not sure why it gets so many raves! It actually lingers for quite a while on my skin, but in this case that's not a very good thing."
5,Love it!,"I've been wearing this perfume for years! I love it and always get compliments whenever I wear it. It's a so light, fresh and clean smelling how can you not love it"
1,Beware,I've been wearing Jovan White Musk for almost 15 years. This is the first time I purchased it online instead of in a store and it will be the last. It almost seems watered down which would make sense considering the size of the bottle is pretty large for such a cheap price. Scent doesn't even last for an hour after putting it on. Very disappointing. I'll be going back to the store to buy from now on.
5,PLEASED,"very pleased with prompt service and cologne was received as listed and with no problems. excellent price, prompt service all positives."
1,not the real thing,"SELLER was amazon.com, LLC - this was not the Jovan White Musk I have used for years - It is a watered down version that the smell is gone with in 5 minutes.CHEAP JUNK!!"
5,Not just for me,"I was wearing this scent yesterday and my boyfriend started sniffing my neck while we were cuddling on the couch. Then he continued smelling me, ad told me I smelled awesome and that the scent was actually turned him on! I've never had a guy notice anything I've been wearing like that. :)"
3,light SCENT,scent smells good -but doesn't stay with you very longis fresh smelling and clean-price was right so thought i would try it
3,Too much pop psychology,"The book is filled with very good research and history. But the author defeats her purpose with endless, tedious pop psychology trying to explain everyone's (especially Eberhardt's)reasons for being and doing what they do. I kept wanting to say, ""Stop playing shrink!"" Finally, I wound up skipping the explanations so that I could appreciate the historical narrative."
2,not very good,rozalla's 'everybody's free' has been remixed a lot. this was another 2001 mix which mixes the song with gitta's club hit 'no more turning back with mixed results. although both tracks are club classics these versions sound unprofessional. not recommended.
3,Patterns are dated,"I had been trying to decide whether to buy the book with all these basic patterns or just get the individual patterns for the basic items I needed. I decided on the book since it was more cost effective. However, I was very disappointed that the patterns are for the over-sized looks from a decade or so ago. I should have realized that from the book cover, however, so it is only my fault. I will have to make pattern alterations for this to be a good source for current basic children's wear."
5,100% pure hot swing combo dance music...,"If you see these cats live, it's like going back to 1949!!! Theyt play authentic red hot small group swing and rhythm'n'blues. Complete with walin' guitar of Eric Leiberman, and the sultry voice of Alicia Aragon, and a few honking horns, and a sizzling rhythm section!!! Great for swing dancing. Aragon adds extremely appealing vocals, that are elegant and sensual at the same time, sort of a modern day Julia Lee!!! And Leiberman's guitar licks is on the level of Charlie Christian's!!! Great music!!!"
1,"Never got them, How can I review them?","I ordered the 5x7 white mailers and was sent another size, after two attempts at contacting the vendor by email to correct this, and getting no reply, I don't feel as if I could honestly review them."
3,"plastic, rubber and nylon for fifty bucks?","OK, first off I'll admit I have two pairs of strap thangs on my car (left and right side of the racks) and I use them nearly everyday for carring my boards to the beach. I just think that this item, like all yakima and thule merchandise is WAY OVER PRICED! All it is is some plastic, some nylon, some rubber and a brass bolt. Jeez...fifty bucks?Oh, one more thing- it takes a lot of fiddling around to get them adjusted right.The really good thing is that your boards are pretty secure and that's the important thing.Lastly- when the rubber bands wear out don't sweat it. Replace with bungee cord material available at a well stocked hardware store."
1,Terrible system...stay away!,"I own this system, and last week lost my $1200 windsurfer while going about 45 mph in a national park. It is terrible.You can't get the system tight without damaging the newer, more delicate boards. In my case the strap simply broke. You have to hook it on the rack, then tighten through a slot, then take the ends of a rubber cord back into a ""cincher."" My cord snapped, and the board went flying.Our local windsurfing shop also says stay away...they know of others who have had problems.The racks are well-made, just this StrapThang is not good. Get a webbed strap or something more sturdy."
1,Mine broke too,"Maybe I was going too fast, but at 70 mph, my board went flying. Luckily the car behind me didn't get hit, but holy crap!!!I was carrying a 9' board, so maybe this should only be for smaller boards (seeing as the other product fails were a sailboard and a paddle board)."
2,Disappointing,"It is very misleading the way in which the author and publisher of this book try to pass it off as an appreciation of Watchman Nee and his work, when it is rather just a poorly researched, somewhat arrogant attempt at showing that Nee was unduly and improperly influenced by the Chinese culture, an assessment that I find both racist and not in the least supported by any of the author's actual writing. In fact, some of the innuendoes levelled against Watchman Nee are so totally inappropriate that they only serve to expose the author for an apparently gross lack of discernment. The book also has a number of blatant factual errors which could be picked up from even the most cursory reading of the text.Not recommended."
2,A Disservice,"I cannot agree with the premise or conclusions of this book. Watchman Nee was a great servant of the Lord, and while disagreeing with his theology is the right of anyone, slandering it is disgraceful. It is a grave disservice to God, and a tawdry human task, to seek enemies among friends. Surely there are wolves among the sheep, but Watchman Nee is certainly not one of them. That Mr. Roberts would entertain and lend credence to the spurious claims of infidelity leveled against Nee is to make libel and rumor the equivalent of fact. I could not finish this book because of its disagreeable, haughty tone. Perhaps Mr. Roberts ameliorates his attitude later, but I was unwilling to find out."
1,Not recommended,"I have to put my thumbs down on this book because I find it highly biased. Although I don't agree with some of Nee's teachings, I have found most of them to be very beneficial to my spiritual growth - giving all to HIS Glory."
1,WARNING! THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK IS EXTREMELY DECEPTIVE!,"The author presents this books as pro Watchman Nee - when it is a blatant attack on Watchman Nee. Roberts is entitled to his opinion, and can write a book against Watchman Nee's teachings if he wants to. But I take issue with the extremely deceptive presentation of his book. Anyone looking at the book will be tricked into thinking the writer is fairly presenting Rev. Nee's teachings. BE WARNED - HE IS NOT! This is just a third-rate ""cut and paste"" dishonest hatchet job on Watchman Nee. And shame on Bridge-Logos for publishing such a deceptive book."
2,A Pathetically Shallow Study,"The author fails to penetrate the depth of Watchman Nee's thought, esperience, and ministry and thus has written a pathetically shallow study of Watchman Nee. Also, the book has a religious flavor that is quite sickening."
4,A fresh angle on two cool topics!,"Poets, buddhists and a lively history of how they mixed together. . . this is a great read for anyone who likes the beat poets OR the buddhist view of the world. There are details and connections and insights in this book that you won't find anywhere else"
1,Item pictured is not item sent,This replacement filter is not the same one as pictured. I received a filter without the white wick fabric around it as pictured. Paid extra for a better filter but received a cheap replacement. Don't waste your money.
1,Great Design - weight reading unreliable/inconsistent,I purchased this because of the great simple design and while I read the negative reviews - I thought I would give it a try - the negative reviews were right. I telephoned Salters to discuss the unreliable/inconsistent weight readings and they told me to wait 5 minutes between stepping on the scale each time - tried that and the problem still persisted - a different reading each time within the same time period.
1,"Attractive, but not functional","Although this scale is very attractive, it is very easily scratched. But the biggest problem is that it does not consistently work. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. I couldn't trust the readings and so returned it."
3,It's all right.,"The shipping took forever. As for the scale itself, well I don't think it's all that accurate. If I get on it twice in a row, it will say two separate weights. Sometimes it's completely off, saying I weigh 89 pounds. The body fat analyzer is completely off, it says I'm at 50% body fat, when I don't think it's humanely possible. (I' 5'2 and weigh 107)."
2,Fools Rush In Where Angels Fear To Tread,"Deepake Chopra outlines a type of therapy that is supposed to prolong life, known as Ayudavistic therapy, a form of Indian folk medicine untouched by Western scientific advances.This book is largely devoid of merit, and acceptance of the contents rests largely on uncritical acceptance of Chopra's statements. In one section, where Chopra discusses the ""connectedness of the universe,"" there is an attempt to bolster his argument throught the use, or misuse, of presentation of a quantum physics theorem. His own understanding of Bell's theorem consists of a deep misunderstanding of what quantum physics is and how one may generalize from its theorems.All-in-all, a bad book, which free mixes science with pseudo-science to yield an unpalatable concoction"
4,Informative and enlighting,I read this book a number of years ago and it is still having a positive effect on my health and spiritual state. Deepak explored and explained scientifically the spiritual effects on the human body. It is not easy reading but well worth the effort.
5,Never Sick anymore,"Dr. Chopra is personally responsible for my complete change in beliefs on being sick. In his book, he states clearly and simply that the natural state of the body is health, not illness. And after reading that, something in my mind locked onto it, believed it and for the last 10 years my body has been living it! I no longer think I need to be sick to build antibodies to various diseases, I simply allow my body to be healthy- even in the midst of coughing and wheezing people. It is a mindset for which I am extremely grateful! A highly valuable read."
3,Did Chopra really deal with quantum healing?,"I was somewhat disappointed. There are levels of activity below the microscopic in the human body. Chopra calls them quantum by default.He says that thoughts are connected to neurotransmitters, but there is no proof for this. I've read many books on quantum physics and the mind, and I'm always looking for a book on quantum chemistry and the mind. I was hoping that Chopra would deal with quantum chemistry more specifically than he did."
4,Great Read,Very interesting. Great for anyone interested in traditional or alternative medicines. Also great for anyone who may need help with their health or just wants to make the most of their current health. I found it quite useful.
4,"A reply to the ""nonsense"" review","A gentle response to the reviewer who thinks this book is nonsense: For your kind information, Carbon is an atom, not a molecule. Now, I am not really a fan of Deepak Chopra, but if this is the level of your scientific knowledge, you hardly have any right to make statements about Dr. Chopras lack or otherwise of scienticic knowledge!A complex organic molecule such as a DNA can hold a great deal of biological information. A simple atom cannot."
4,Good for government contracting official and resercher,"This book contains much analyse in theory,and proposes some problems which are worthy to be studied by us.contract management is the most important phase in the Federal acquisition procedure,that this book focuses on it show me the way to settle the trouble ,which we must be confronted with in establishing government acquisition system in China.So ,i think this book is especially good for govenment contracting official and resercher in the countries which still havn't established their own government acquisition system."
4,good deal,product doesn't specify authenticity. it appears to be new. works well so far. doesn't arrive in on-line advertised packaging so i'm not sure if it's the real deal or not.
2,NOT genuine Samsung as represented. SHAME on this seller!,"No way of knowing yet how well this works, but the seller sent me a Samsung ""compatable"" product, NOT a Samsung item as advertised. Buyer beware!"
1,FAKE: This is NOT an Original Samsung Cartridge,"The seller has pictures of ORIGINAL Samsung cartridges on his site. However, you're getting a REMANUFACTURED cartridge instead. DO NOT BUY if you want to have a an original cartridge. It prints as it should but that's about it.I thought I'd be getting a good price for an original cartridge. Remanufactured ones can be had for less money. It's a ripoff for a non-original cartridge. Do NOT BUY."
1,NOT a compatible cartridge !!,"I had to return this ""compatible"" cartridge because my Samsung printer would not recognize it. Once I bought an official Samsung cartridge, the printer worked just fine."
2,NOT the advertised original Samsung toner,"I bought this for my Samsung SCX-4725FN printer thinking is the original toner as advertised. I received 2 ""compatible?"" no name toner cartriges that my printer did not recognized. I contacted the seller and they sent me a return label. They fully refunded my purchase but only after they received the items and I emailed them again to request it."
5,Wargamers Gem/Market Garden,"One of my favorites this book provides Maps Photos showing the routes ofattack and defensive positions, for British and German units locked in a death embrace for the ""Island"".The writing puts you in the front lines up close . So close that you begin to imagine you hear that dry unemotional British Narative cracking with fear and the bone tiredness that only the walking dead infantry know,Yet rising in defiant waves and carrying the lads to final victory. Filled with comments of Participents BUY IT."
1,Not as good as REAL liquid sucralose,"I tried this hoping that it would be a cost-effective alternative to using REAL liquid sucralose, which I love! However, this has been watered down so much it doesn't taste anything like the crisp, pure, sweet taste of pure liquid sucralose, which is MUCH MUCH more expensive, unfortunately. But a tiny bit of the real thing goes a LONG way. If you try using more of this for a sweeter flavor, it just tastes really strange, but never as sweet."
2,Good but not cost effective,The shipping and handling was a horrendous $7 eliminating any cost effectiveness I was hopping on getting.
1,Already Broken,"Installed this part on my 1997 Wrangler April 8th, 2011. It lasted until April 21st before it broke in half. Theres no binding on the HVAC door it controls and the door is controlled by vacuum so nothing is forcing it to break. It was a very difficult installation and now I have to do it again along with finding another part that will last more than 2 weeks. The OEM part lasted over 14 years! Over 20 dollars down the drain. Very disappointed."
1,Disappointed and disgusted,"Years ago I attended an MLM seminar with a hopeful friend, which amounted to a full day of marketing brainwashing. That's what this is, 74 minutes of corporate motivational speakers haranguing us, the hopefuls, on how to be better salespeople and financial geniuses. What little spiritual content there was was buried within tiresome big business rhetoric. The chapters all run together unidentified, without titles, the editing is choppy, the colors very dark and hard to see in daylight hours, and the production values very poor. And the ""Extras"" amounts to sales pitches for several of the speakers. It's definately not in the same league as ""The Secret"". I feel insulted and disgusted. I want my money back."
2,Just OK,"Although I love Bob Proctor,I can't say this video did anything for me. I bought it for 4.99 online and I'm glad that's all I spent. It's nothing I would watch over and over again like ""The Secret"". Didn't hear anything new and it didn't leave me with the ""wow"" factor when it was over, with my wheels spinning, replaying what I heard over and over again in my mind. In fact, the minute it was over, it was really over...I just forgot about it. Can't put my finger on it, but it just didn't do anything for me. Sorry, but I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Recap of the Masters,"I think it was Walter Wattles who initially wrote about the ""Law of Attraction"" in the early 1900s. So this movie is, in effect, the glam version for the those that might prefer to watch rather than read about its tenets. Confucius noted centuries ago that there's nothing new under the sun; perhaps he was on to something after all?The DVD itself of course had to have a broad-based appeal, something that everyman (and everywoman) could identify with. That said, as long as you know the specific area in your life that needs a tune up, ""The Secret"" might be of some assistance to you."
2,It's not the sequel to The Secret...,Do get it and it's not as I originally thought and often presented as the sequel to the wonderful movie The Secret. The production leaves much to be desired. I am a fan of the message/s and of Bob Proctor and I believe you would be better off getting these similar messages elsewhere.
2,secret,"The product was arrived as advertised, yet the material was not as I had expected. The beyond the secret video, was not beyond, nor did it meet the fundamental criteria, for the law of attraction. It was a trifle bit melancholy on the whole.I wish i had't spent my money on this video."
3,"Doesn't really move ""beyond.""","I anxiously awaited the release of this film, having been captivated by ""The Secret."" It was my understanding that the content of this film would help viewers move ""beyond"" that original introduction to the subject matter, exposing real methodology and techniques to help us master the art of the Law of Attraction in our own lives.Instead, the film really is nothing more than a re-hash of the concepts already presented very well in ""The Secret."" It's like they're telling the same story, just using some different (and some of the same) teachers. As I was viewing this, I became more and more frustrated, because I kept thinking, ""yes, I know that,"" ""yes, I know that,"" but was longing for the education to help really put the LOA into effect.It is certainly not a bad film, and the information presented is all correct. Unfortunately, ""Beyond the Secret,"" doesn't really move ""beyond"" at all."
1,Appalling,"If you've seen The Secret and liked it then you will be appalled by this effort.The quality of the video is appalling, the editing little better.The presentation smacks of a marketing attempt to profit from Rhonda Byrne's excellent original video.The information presented is certainly useful but not presented nearly as well as the original and certainly doesn't take you ""beyond"" the secret.Bob Proctor you always present excellent, well-presented , informative material - what on earth were you thinking of when you allowed this to be released??"
2,"book contains lots of resources, but its usefulness is limited","This book is quite nice for the spoiled programmer who has been using a modern OO language such as C++ or python, and demonstrates methods to implement OO concepts as classes, overloading and polymorphism in Fortran 90/95 (F9X in the remainder of this review)This however is also its main weakness: Even though F9X can be forced into these concepts, using those concepts, especially the proposed polymorphism method, is a tedious task, and makes a lot of the magic of OO programming disappear.What is lacking in this book is an explicit overview of concepts which cannot be implemented easily in F9X, such as destructors, interfaces and inheritance, as that might be reason enough to forget about trying to implement your program in F9X.My main conclusion after reading this is that trying to do OO in F9X is incomplete and way too much trouble, and thus the need for this book is rather limited."
3,bird eggfood,my bird really didnt care for it at all. he loved the bird egg biscuits and no one carries them anymore.
3,My female finches love it but...,"This food was well received by my finches. But it did not bring my lesser seed finch females into breeding condition; which is what I wanted most. However, it worked well for my other birds."
1,Never received,"Unfortunately, I am unable to give my opinion of the book. It was supposedly shipped on 9/2. Today is 10/10 and I still don't have the book. I will tell you that I finally had to go to the library as I needed the artwork and it really is a cute story. I would recommend if you purchase that you use ANY OTHER METHOD OF DELIVERY than the ""snail mail"" which I was told by the company they used to ship. Who knows...maybe by Christmas!"
2,"Better seal, less comfort","As nice as the E3c's are, how they sound is highly dependent on the seal you get. The triple-flange sleeves are designed to get you a better seal in your ear, and they do accomplish that (in comparison with the other plastic sleeves originally included with the earphones).Nevertheless, these sleeves have a big drawback: they're extremely uncomfortable. They are very long and often feel like they're putting pressure on my inner ear, pressure that extends almost into the throat area. If I were to do it all over again, I would buy a pack of replacement foam sleeves instead. I believe you can get a 10-pair pack of the foam replacements for $20. The foam inserts are simply more comfortable (more like a soft earplug) and, if replaced often enough, create a seal with relative ease."
5,Perfect -- the difference between mediocre and great headphones,"I've been using them at night, on airplanes.. These made the difference between me not really liking my headphones very much and really loving them. They block out sound better than most ear plugs and stay in my ears. Great!"
5,Great,I love these. They fit great and isolate great.The retail price is $10 for 3 or 4 pair. Do not buy 1 pair for $10. Someone's opening the retail box and making 75% profit over the retail price.
5,great enhancement for noise cancellation and sound improvement,"These sleeves worked great for increasing the effective noise cancelling capability as well as the overall sound quality of the E3c earphones. They most noticably improved the bass response - as they make for a much more secure fit. They fit better if the stem is trimmed to be flush with the flange itself, and although they were specifically noted to be for the e1's and e5's, they work great on my e3's. Overall - a great way to enhance the earphones that I would recommend to everyone that uses them."
4,Hard to install but SO worth the effort!,"I love the sound of my Shure headphones but hated the foam sleeves which were disintegrating, hurting, and constantly falling out of my ears. I had a doctor tell me recently to lay off the q-tips, and I'm sure what they were really seeing was the damage being done by shoving in those messed up headphones!Anyway, cut to my recent order of these triple-flange sleeves. They were kind of difficult to put onto the headphones - I recommend twisting them down onto the stem like a screw once you work the opening over the tip of the stem. (This issue is why I took the rating down to four stars). Once you get them on there they seem to stay.They sound just great, and they stay put through my workout - no more constant shoving back into my ear - hooray!! Plus these are comfortable - they feel just like the musician's earplugs I wear out to nightclubs - once you get them set in your ear canal you'll forget they're there ('cept for the great sound, that is!)"
4,Shiny happy sun music,"I became acquainted with Letters To Cleo back in the mid-90s when I heard their song ""Here And Now"" on the radio and the Melrose Place soundtrack. I bought Aurora Gory Alice and Wholesale Meats and Fish at the same time. It's a good thing I did. I became interested in Letters To Cleo because I liked ""Here and Now,"" but all the songs that have the sound of ""Here and Now"" are found on Wholesale Meats and Fish. I found Aurora Gory Alice to be a quite boring album, and if I hadn't also bought Wholesale Meats and Fish, I would have assumed these guys were a one-hit wonder. I like the music of every song on Wholesale Meats and Fish; I only skip ""Demon Rock"" and ""Acid Jed"" because I don't like the lyrics. I bought this when I lived in Los Angeles, and with its sunny summer sound, when I hear it now it takes me back to the mountains and beaches of L.A. Other groups I listen to when I'm in this mood are Belly, Sugar, Elastica, and early Popinjays ('91-'92)."
4,"Original ""alternative"" Kinda Style!","Letters To Cleo - an awesome band. Wholesale Meats&Fish - an awesome album. The only reason this album didn't get 5 *s (stars) is because not *ALL* the songs kept me groovin`... which a 5-star album should do...With Kay Hanley's awesome lyrics & vox along with LTC's great poppy/punky sound... this album was superb! The only songs I skip (on occasion) are ""Jennifer"" & ""Laudanum""... Some great hits are: ""Demon Rock"", ""Awake"", ""Pizza Cutter"", ""Little Rosa"", ""Acid Jed"", ""Fast Way"", & ""I Could Sleep (The Wuss Song)""... LTC's finest album! Check it out if you are a fan of cool female vocals & punky guitar riffs."
3,Was expecting more,"LTC has always been something of a paradox: an alternative group that also wants to hit the Top-40 scene. I'm not against that philosophy, but this wasn't great as their immediately previous album. ""Awake"" made it mainstream, but many of the other songs here are nothing to write home about. I'm sorry to say this because I really enjoyed them when they first hit the radio. I really hope that they come out with something better, LTC really has promise! (to LETTERS TO CLEO): Sell out! Go Top-40! I won't mind..."
2,"The vocals are amazing, the music is blah","I was a big fan of Kay Hanley's performance on the Josie & The Pussycats movie soundtrack, so I picked up this album...um, not so good.There are a few decent tracks on this disc, they are:-""Demon Rock"": Up-tempo alternative rock w/ edgy vocals.-""Fastway"": Another alternative, droning vocal attack.-""Jennifer"": Upbeat and fun.-""Little Rosa"": A sweet song, perfect display of Kay's vocal range.This really should have been a 4 song EP, because the rest of the tracks are gratingly annoying on a musical level. Just a lot of fuzz and no good riffs to keep your interest. Even a great vocalist can't make a bad song enjoyable.If you liked the band's cover of ""I Want You To Want Me"" from 10 Things I Hate About you, I would suggest that you buy the Josie and The Pussycats soundtrack and not this album, it's nothing like that."
5,This rocks.,"Unlike a zillion LTC fans who became fan after seeing '10 Things I Hate About You' I've been listening to them for years. They've come a long way. This album sounds less alternative than the previous 2 albums but that doesn't mean that that is a bad thing. And I'm not putting down the previous 2 albums because they're equally brilliant. And Go! is very good too. LTC is simply a band who are very skilled musicians and know how to write good songs wether it sounds poppy or alternative. I sadly don't own Sister yet but I'm working on that cause from what songs I've heard of that it's very good.My fave's on this album have to be Demon Rock, Fast Way and St. Peter. They have a nice groove to them.Do yourself a favor. Listen to the other 3 albums too but try not to expect the same as the songs you've heard in 10 Things I Hate About You. The songs in that movie are very good but their others are good too even if they have a slightly different style.*push button wait for rock*"
3,Must buy for the Blues Traveller,"Excellent guitar but let's please not draw parallels with the Legend Stevie R.Vaughan.This CD starts off well with Born With A Broken Heart and carries off well with Everybody gets the blues but the best has to be the very bluesy guitar play on While We Cry ,one number which even the uninitiated would appreciate.All in all a great effort with Corey Sterling adding the sugar.This was a Valantines present from my fiance...all the more reason for me to be appreciating it. Check out Johnny Lang's 'Lie to me' and 'Wander the world'...definetly worth picking up."
5,KWS Best Guitar Player ever !!!,Anyone who loves Kenny Wayne Shepard should own this albumn....Shame Shame Shame on you if don't buy it...you won't be sorry !
1,yellow ledbetter?!?!?!?!?,"Ever heard of a band called Pearl Jam.......they have a song called ""yellow ledbetter"" in which kenny wayne shepherd ripped off and called ""while we cry""...and then starts the song by saying its an instrumental HE wrote."
5,Phenomenonal guitar player,"Kenny Wayne Shepherd continues to get more and more amazing. His debut CD has got some of the most fantastic blues tracks to come out in years. Though the album is carried by songs such as ""Born With a Broken Heart"" and ""While We Cry,"" the best has got to be ""Shame, Shame, Shame."" However, this laid-back, awe-inspiring tune is even more mind-blowing when KWS performs it live with Noah Hunt (who with his sexy baritone is 1,000 times better than the lead singer on this CD, Corey Sterling). A must-have for any blues/rock fan."
4,changing members in your band changes the sound,I still think Kenny is the next Stevie Ray but his sound changed when he changed his whole band.Still great lyrics and sound just different than Live On my favorite.Kenny still has what some great person said in their reveiw on Live On that I read as I was doing mine. He does need to show his on style more.But this is still a good CD. I play it for getting a good mood swing with it's sound.Would recomend to any of my students at the College.
2,Very good...but at least be honest,"I defy anyone to tell me that ""While we cry"" is not Pearl Jams - Yellow Ledbetter. I mean..its the same exact song, he just took the words out. You can sing the exacy lyrics of Ledbetter along with it. Not only that but the Melody is the exact freakin same. He does it well, but its not hisCovers are cool...but don't be a theif!!"
3,Enjoyable Rockin' Rhythm and Blues,"Shepherd is reminiscent of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan, and therefore makes Stevie's fans yearn for the real deal. This makes a review by a confirmed SRV fan somewhat suspect and potentially unfair to Kenny Wayne, who is an accomplished blues guitarist - just not in Vaughan's class."
1,This is NOT suitable for Lafuma recliners!!!,"Description states ""suitable for both Standard and XL size Faulkner and Lafuma recliners""It is NOT suitable for Lafuma recliners, the plastic ends are too thick to thread through a Lafuma grommet twice, which is necessary in certain spots. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM IF YOU WANT TO RE-LACE A LAFUMA RELINER!!!"
1,Don't buy this book!,"This book is terrible. I have used the comparable Princeton Review, Kaplan, and Barrons books and found each to be much better than this. The practice test questions are not like the real test questions at all! Don't even bother checking this out of a library, it's that bad. Practice tests in this book don't include critical reasoning, nor do they cover most of the sentence correction topics covered in the real GMAT. The math questions don't include anything with prime numbers, integers, or inequalities, all of which are prevalant on the real GMAT. Conclusion--this is not a book you want to buy to study for the GMAT. Kaplan, Barrons, Princeton Review (in that order) should be what you need for GMAT preparation. Even if you own all three and just want more practice (like me) this book will not help AT ALL."
1,THIS IS AWFUL,This book is by far the worst test-prep book I have ever opened. I found 2 errors in the first 6 questions of the sentence correction section. I can't believe I wasted... on this book. DON'T BUY IT!!!
1,Warning! I would rate it 0 stars if I could,"The book is useless, the CD-rom is a fake. The test is really online with no evaluation of the results. The questions on the test are from the planet Mars. Get it!"
1,"Disgusting, Horrible",Dear People who wish to make high on GMAT; This book is horrible. Its math questions are all the same from one test to another. The reading passages are very long and not prepare you for the GMAT reading. The sentence correction questions are focused around a few concepts. You cannot do the critical reasoning quetions with GMAT reasoning. Don't buy this book if you want to save your time and your money.
1,A really bad guide,"First section of the diagnostic test has 2 errors in the first 6 questions. Question 2 on Page 11 has the same choice for options 1 and 3. Explanation for question 6 on page 12 lists the following as the correct choice: 'In the last fifteen years, despite the narrow nationalist vision of some countries, Kenyan marathon runners HAVE GAINED RESPECTED throughout the running world.' I did not bother with the rest of the book - it went right back to the store.This book also includes CD ROM, whose only function is to create links to Peterson's internet site on your computer, and which does not have actual practice tests, like the other guides."
4,Great inexpensive Wedgwood collection piece,"Like the set . . . weird that the set comes with a dinner plate, cup, saucer, and 2 sides plates (bread and butter and salad) but no bowl."
3,Haitian or Cuban?,"Since MP3 downloads come without any liner notes, it's hard to tell the background of this music. Though performed by a Cuban group, some of the song titles and rhythms remind me more of Haiti. In general the rhythms and background vocals are quite infectious. The lead singer has a rather bizarre voice, however: high, nasal, and with a wild quaver. A more accessible collection you might want to try first is Raices Africanas by Grupo Afrocuba."
1,Its fail,"This watch has a lot of... potential.Maybe one day they will figure out to make it all work right and less frustrating to navigate.I'm not saying DON'T buy this watch... actually, don't buy this watch."
4,A Great Contempary Start,"I really wanted to write a review on this book because I thought it was brilliant, however half way through typing it AOL cut me off and I haven't time to do it again, now, so I'll try later, maybe tomorrow."
2,A Disappointment,"Ms. Putney has written many historical novels with intricate plots and sympathetic attractive characters. However, in this, her first contemporary novel, her plot is simplistic and rather boring, and her characters( who might be believable in the 19th century) are paper-thin and trite in the 21st!"
1,"Yes, Virginia, I Can Still Be Shocked","I took the advise of the reviewer, Ms. Manning, and read this for myself, and on many levels, I found the book horribly shocking. The woman (heroine?)was a victim of her parents and was willingly manipulated by an awful father. Her husband? I actually liked him better than her since he at least acknowledged he had a problem. What I really find shocking, though, is the attitude of the reviewers. One calls the issue of beating up women a ""controversial"" subject. One relegates this violence to ""political correctness"". I really thought beating the h--- out of someone smaller than you was universially deplored (except by the perpetrator). There's nothing controversial or political about beating up women and children. It's quite simply disgusting and the bully who does it is a scum bag."
2,not her best. disappointing,"Since first starting this love of romance almost 10 years ago, I've read some brilliant books and some drivel, usually I can rate Mary Jo as one of my top five authors but after reading this book, she is slipping. An abusive husband, best friends sleeping with husbands, I don't care that they were already divorced, you don't do that to a friend. I probably get too involved with the book, but this is my escape, I would prefer their life to be better than mine."
1,1st Review Ever for Worst Book by Favorite Author ever,"I'm sick to my stomach.The author has the heroine blaming herself for not staying in an abusive relationship to try and fix it. That she only put up with it long enough for a few ER visits and then got out without giving her marriage a real chance by fighting for it.I read until almost 100 pages until the end, hoping that she'd finally stop being ""discrete"" and not ""gossiping"" or ""airing dirty laundry"" and finally tell her mother why she left the man her parents adored as their own.Her mother said one or two things about how awful it was that he hit her and that they never could have loved him like they did if they'd known, but within a few sentences was praising the virtues of forgiveness.This is a sick book and the message it sends hurts my heart.I'll take a bullet for my husband as long as he's not pointing the gun.This book says that, if you're a good wife, you'll have found a way to make him put down the gun and treat you right. :("
2,Nauseating...not a very good read.,"This book was nauseating. As I read this book, I found myself exclaiming: 'Give me a break' and 'Oh, brother'. It was not a very good read. However, kudos to the author for her knowledge in the area of explosive demolition...very detailed."
2,DISTURBING,"As some of the other reviewers, I too have witnessed violence against women, and found this book very disturbing. When I first realized where this book was going, I started to put it down, but decided I would see how she handled the subject. I admit this book was well written and emotional, I had knots in my stomach every time Donovan got mad, I was not convinced he was ""cured"" maybe just simmering... I loved Mary Jo Putney's previous works, but this one... a mistake."
2,"Good Plot, Broing Development","Putney has a good plot line. It's too bad she didn't develop it better. The characters are not endearing enough to get the reader emoitionally invovled. Also, she depends too much on the dialogue to get the story out. As a result, the characters have conversations that seem forced and unnatural. They also tend to use words and phrases every so often that people do not use today. As a first attempt at a contemporary story, this is a good effort. However, Putney needs to put away the behaviors of her period books when writing for today."
2,Give her other books a try!!,"Overall I thought it was just okay at best. If I had not read some of her other books, I would not do so now. All of the demolition stuff bored me after a bit. The mystery of the cause of the problems seemed obvious. I did not like Kate, her mother, her father or her friends. The only one I liked was Donovan and I felt bad for liking an abusive guy. I was happy that the retelling of the violence was not too detailed or too violent. I have read much worse in ""Romance"" novels and was led to believe that this one was difficult to read. While I think no one should put up with being hit even one time and should definitely not feel shame as though they were the cause of the violence, I think that the way this story was written one could believe that Donovan was no longer dangerous. Kate seemed to come from a pretty messed up family and I almost felt that the reformed Donovan deserved better. In the end I just didn't care about any of them."
2,"good writing, unbelievable story","I have always enjoyed Ms. Putney's historical romances very much. And I found this to be an engrossing book to read, but I found the treatment of abuse in this relationship to be too simplified. The heroine stayed with her abusive husband until she became violent in response to him, and that's what finally made her leave? Please. I also found it completely unbelievable that she did not tell anyone why she left her husband, and then put up with attempts to get them back together from her family - and the main reason she did this was to save the relationship between her father and her husband? No way. Finally, the ""cure"" of her ex-husband was mentioned only briefly - he went into group therapy after she left - but he was still having violent reactions to her by the end of the book. I never believed that he was ""cured"" (for lack of a better word), and that their relationship would ever be a healthy one."
2,A Contemporary Romance?,"A Burning Point focuses on a difficult subject. Having gone through this situation myself, I believed the premise. My problem was the book itself.Ms. Putney's characters, for me, displayed only surface emotions. I never understood their behavior patterns--the problems that drove them apart. Or, the problems that drove them together. And, probably as it SHOULDN'T be, I actually liked Donovan better than Kate.Secondly, I found the story going in too many directions, with too many characters. The problems of Tom, Kate's brother, may have belonged in another novel. Also, the secondary romance, while nice, distracted me from what was probably meant to be the ""burning point"". Add to that the ""mystery?"", you've got a book, that is, only half done--in several places. Also, I found Ms. Putney's contemporary-speak, uneven.Will I try another contemporary by Ms. Putney. I kind of doubt it. For me, it wasn't the subject, but the story, which made this a read I didn't enjoy."
2,Unease,"I never miss a Mary Jo Putney book - but I did not like this story. The subject of domestic violence deserved more than the treatment it received here.I am left with the very uneasy feeling that violence will occur again in this relationship. Donovan's renaissance as a man in control of his anger seemed only on the surface - and the heroine discovers her OWN violent side. In most of Ms. Putney's books, I feel satisfied that the main characters have come through great problems and dangers and are going into the future as two people who belong together. I get no such feeling from this book."
2,DOESN' T WORK,"I've always admired Mary Jo Putney's willingness to tackle difficult topics and my admiration has not waned because I couldn't believe in this book.She is still a fine writer and she should be commended for her willingness to take chances on scenarios that aren't going to be easy reads. But, that said, BURNING POINT doesn't work for me. And it doesn't work because the hero doesn't work, not because of the topic. I found that I couldn't really believe in him. He was too much of a textbook case and his reasons for his behavior, while logical, didn't seem to spring from the deep inner core of his being. He was flat. I wanted to believe in him -- and in his problems -- and I couldn't.I do believe people can change, and I do believe in the redemptive power of love. I'm not saying I don't think second chances work. And I don't believe it's irresponsible of Ms. Putney to imply that it's possible. I just didn't believe in these people. I wish I had."
4,Overall a good prayer aid,"I just receieved my copy of the CD set today and after listening to the Sorrowful Mysteries I can only find one drawback. It's toooo fast! The prayers are being far to fast for me to keep up. In fact, I had trouble catching my breath between Hail Marys. I would mush rather have the prayers slowed down a bit so that I can concenrate on the words and thoughts. Other than that, the music is great and helps one meditate during the mysteries. I would suggest this CD set overall and if you can keep up with the speed at which the prayers are said you'll really enjoy it!"
3,"Good content, so-so presentation","I'll echo the pros and cons listed in other reviews and add my two cents...It's clear the speakers recorded each prayer only once, and then those recordings were strung together (no pun intended) to make up the decades. I found the woman speaker's voice to be calming, but the male speaker's delivery and inflections reminded me of a corporate training video...a little too canned, and having that inflection and delivery repeated over and over is something of a distraction."
2,OK if you like a pop music sound,"As a person who prefers Gregorian Chant to pop music, I found this to be a disappointment, but if you like ""easy listening"" music, this may work for you."
5,Helps me with my prayer time.,I live in New York City. I commute via mass transit. This CD set helps me utilize my morning commute as quality prayer time.
4,Nice aid for the Rosary,"I'm an Episcopalian,and I've recently begun to recite the Rosary on a daily basis. I use this CD to help me pray in the morning, and the Rosary is the exact length of my commute home, so I play it on my way home from work.The rosary is not sung, but reciTed to music; and is very pleasant. My only objection is that there is no silence after the mystery."
3,"NOT A GREAT ALBUM,BUT NOT A BAD ONE EITHER.",I would have to say that this album for me sounds mediocre compared to their past work.David vincents vocals seem uninspired here and this is partly due to the fact that he probably wanted to quit the band at this point.Im guessing that the band was experimenting with creating a certain sound on this album which just did not grab me by my nads because it wasnt heavy as it usually is.I cant say that I completely dislike this album but I just cant get into it like their previous albums.Some people may really enjoy this album and I can respect that too.PEACE OUT!!!
4,It all makes sense to me now,"Although Domination is not my favorite MA album, it is one of the more interesting to me anyway. And the reason for this is because when I heard this record, it made me realize that the reason MA stands apart from all the other bands playing death metal is that their music is actually catchy. This is seriously one of the most catchy death metal records of all time. Another great CD.Song Picks:1. Eyes to See, Ears to Hear2. Caesars Palace3. Inquisition (Burn With Me)"
2,Major Disapointment,"Why oh why do people love this album. The album is so overproduced; the drums sounds too triggered and/or computerized and the vocals are downright bad. The best part about the album are Trey's solos, which stand out very much. There are a few good tracks: Dominate, Where the Slime Live, Hatework, but the rest of the album seems like filler.With regard to the vocals, David Vincent did an excellent job on Morbid Angel's first three albums, but on this CD, David sounds really cheezy. I saw Morbid Angel when they toured in support of this album. It was a very disapointing concert. David seemed to have no interest in the music or the crowd and it was obvious that he was burnt out. Listen to Morbid Angel's album, Entangled In Chaos, and its painfully obvious that David's vocals were in decline and that he was holding the band back.A poor follow up to Covenant."
2,Morbid Angel Has The Potential...,"...But it's their singing I can't get by. I bought this CD on the recommendations of an Internet friend. I think M.A.'s music is great and heavy, but has not so good lyrics. They really could use some improvement on their lyrics. Them and Napalm Death, another potentially good band. Yet a power ballad like ""Dreaming"" seems to indicate Morbid Angel is going in the right direction. My point is with M.A. and N.D. is that their not that great, but it could be worse. Thanx and Peace."
2,BIG RECORD PRODUCER=SELLOUT,"SORRY, IT IS TRUE. FOR MORE MONEY, MA HAD TO CUT WHAT THEY ARE GOOD AT. THIS ALBUM HAS LOST THE ORIGINALTY THAT MORBID ANGEL ONCE POSSESSED. ONCE I GOT THIS ALBUM, THAT WAS ALL FOR THEM. IF YOU WANT CLASSIC MORBID, GO WITH 'BLESSED ARE THE SICK' IF YOU WANT YOUR AVERAGE DEATH METAL WITH LAME LYRICS, HERE IT IS. SORRY GUYS, BUT TREY STILL KICKS."
4,Not as bad as some wrote!,I see some other reviews called this extremely satanic metal. Satan is only metioned one time on the entire CD. The rest may refer to him but not as bad as some wrote reviews on here. Sure the cover is considered satanic but most other metal bands have the same kind of art work. I think this is brutal in your face metal. It has a rawness to it that would probaly be considered classic in any metalheads collection. This Cd was actually better than i expected. I plan to try others by this band.
2,BORING,This album wasn't very good. The riffs are usually pretty slow and there are a few of fillers which are nothing but cheap tribal drum music.if you want fast death metal try ENTOMBED if you want melodic death metal try ARCH ENEMY but dont buy this album unless you are a big morbid angel fan
1,Crappy vocals...,"Morbid angel has no talent at all... Man, i was so bored while listining to this album. Where's the brutality ? Just skip it!"
4,Morbid Angel - Satanic Death Metal with heart,"Hello! This is a very nice to CD to have and hold, til death do you part. Think you just like the fast stuff? Check out the grinding guitars and Jourgenesque (Ministry) vocals on ""Where the Slime Live"", that'll change your mind. This is a definite buy people. It has something for everyone, thrashy speed on ""Dominate, and Inquisition (Burn with me)"" to an odd, relaxing beauty on ""Dreaming, and Hatework."" M.A. is a good band, Vincents vocals are pretty creepy, and Azagthoth's (don't ask) warped solos are impressive. It is hard to go wrong with M.A. P.S. Gotta love that ending to Inquisition! ""I think i'll do some burning of my own!"""
5,Great,"Though not as good as the last one this one did have a redeming feature, it tells the story from the point of view of the Orcs. Trall is now my new favorite charcter."
5,Warcraft,Not only is Warcraft an amazing computer game it is now an amzing series of book. Of the books in this series this i byfar my favorite. It really gives readers information on Thrall's past. It also explains parts left out in the game
3,Unoriginal,"Basically, this is a copy of Spartacus by R. Jovaniolli, if that's how you spell it, converted into the world of Warcraft. Spartacus was a Roman slave, trained to be a gladiator, who then ran away, and rose other slaves and gladiators to fight against rome. He actually collected an enormous army of these people, but then was defeated. Same stuff. Encampents are gladiator schools, etcThe only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because if you forget about originality, then you'll actually get quite a book. Although I dislike the idea of everyone coming to help Thrall. Sounds kinda stupid... maybe it's just me. Read this book if you want to."
4,Intrigueing,"A book from the Orc's point of view, at first I was skeptical that they could pull it off well, but it turns out they did it very well. I was drawn into their society and the book as a whole left me wanting more. Great job.**A book I would also recommend is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This, the first installment of The Morcyth Saga is a great beginning for a new author. Battles, magic, gods, secret passages and intrigue, all the elements of a classic epic fantasy! Any fantasy reader will enjoy it"
4,Spend a weekend in history,"This is an enormously easy-to-use travelogue/history book that takes readers on a journey through events that shaped Texas history. The authors have a long history of their own writing about accessible historic places and lessons, especially for kids, and this book is no exception. They hit the high points of extraordinary people, places and events (although a few more contemporary notable figures and spots are noticeably absent) and provide a logical unfolding for the traveler.It's worth the effort and worth the time to use this book as a guide for your next excursion into Texas yesteryear."
3,"Cute book, not a travel guide","This has basic information for the majority of Texas towns on main roads and such. If you're looking for real history or a real travel book, then keep looking. This book basically is a collection of trivia and odds & ends. It is not a real travel guide nor is it a history of Texas by any stretch fo the imagination."
5,Bobby Caldwel...the ultimate entertainer!,"I have all of the Bobby Caldwell's CDs...and they are all great. However, ""Stuck on You"" is my favorite. He is SO talented and has been around for decades, yet so many people don't know about him. If you have have an opportunity to see him perform in person, don't miss it. Bobby Caldwell gives 150%! This guy does it all..."
5,Best teacher resource available....parents too!,"Growing up Learning is used primarily in our VoWac teacher training sessions. It is a wonderful tool for teachers to be familiar with. It provides them with vital information in determining a child's learning strength(s), and methods and ideas that can be use to help teach children. Teachers and parents will be able to determine their own learning strength and apply that knowledge in dealing with their own children and students. Although Amazon is telling you 4 - 6 weeks...call VoWac Publishing at (605)598-4492. Delivery in 2-3 days $13.00 plus s/h. If I could recommend only one resource book for teachers and parents....THIS IS IT!"
1,Total rip off!,"This is a weak sales letter for the author to sell his printing press with the hopes that you'll self-publish through him.The book lacks substance in a major way. Each ""topic"" is nothing more than a few sentences. At best this would have been a solid outline for the Brent Sampson's real book. He never embellishes on any specific topic and makes a bunch of ""micro"" recommendations without much of a structured order and then the book is over. You can literally (without exaggeration) read this book inside of 15 minutes. If you are a fast reader, you can read the whole thing in 7 1/2 minutes!I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone considering self-publishing. In fact, use a search engine for ""self-publishing houses"" and you'll come up with several self-publishing companies that will send you free information that has much more substance than this weak, poorly constructed ""book."""
2,Look elsewhere,"The author calls this book a fun, fast read but doesn't say for who.The intended audience for such a tiny book is a big question. Certainly not for anyone who has read any self-publishing book, perhaps a grandmother that wants to publish the story of her life for her grandchildren.The book would better be called a promotional giveaway pamplet, it is small enough to fit in your back pocket and there are some pages that contain less than half a dozen sentences, so yes it is a very fast read indeed.Not much here, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.The author's other books would be a much better choice. They are more complete and better written."
4,good selection of garifuna music,Exellent selection of garifuna music from Honduras. You can listen to the traditional punta and also get to know the actual evolution
3,Peaceful defection,"Two ex-Crimsonites get to exercise their repressed hippie sides. There is a little too much generic fluff for the album to matter as a whole, but thankfully there are many folk-prog elements along the way to admire, ending of course with the most ambitious final suite."
3,McDonald and Giles,"There are some nice moments on this album (couldn't isolate them at this point however, I only listened to it once)."
3,The remaster sounds beautiful but,"the music is dull. But really, this is one of the best-produced compact discs I've ever heard."
5,incredible force!,"I bought the vinyl way back when (I believe it was on the Cotillion label) and loved ""Tomorrow's People"". I had to have it again. One reviewer commented on the skips between movements of the ""Birdman Suite""...well, I bought that version anyway based on the strength of his review and, guess what? NO SKIPS! It IS perfect except for some analog hiss, which is more than tolerable. The insert booklet has a lot of dialog with M&G, this is the authorized remaster, and the learned ear will hear differences from the original vinyl (changes made by the artists themselves, they cop to that in the booklet). I advise this HDCD version over the $35.00 Jap issue and buy something else great with the savings, you're gonna love this one. DGP."
4,"Dreamy, intense, exceptional","If you enjoy the ""softer"" side of the first King Crimson album,this is an exellent quality extension. All the best of that sound is here,without Mr Fripp's guitar/synth sound and without Greg Lake's vocal stylings. You will not miss themvery much. This disk is musical effort obviously producedwith loving attention by multi-instrumentalist Ian Mcdonaldand drummer Michael Giles.Every ting of the cymbal,everypluck of the guitar string,every tone of the flutes,sax, ect isrecrorded with depth and precision. Get out your headphones, pour your bottle of whatever--or light your whatever--and enjoy. You cannot go wrong with this one."
4,A Fine Little Film,"I caught a screening of this film in Austin before it was released and thought it was pretty funny, well done stuff considering its obvious budget limitations.If you are a fan of indie film then throw your love at this movie. Buy a copy and help support the little guy!"
3,Mac users beware,"I got this because I'm both a Goldfrapp fan and an m83 fan. I was really excited when I heard on wikipedia that there was an m83 remix of Black Cherry. This disc is a really hard find. I couldn't find it in any store I went to in Seattle, anyhow. The m83 remix lives up to expectations; it takes a 3-star song and refreshes it into 4-star material. In terms of sound, it is similar to m83's Before The Dawn Heals Us era.The Twist remix by Kurtis is definitely NOT good. It's a very forgettable ""jungle-pop"" drum machine mix. Listening to it only made me pine for the original Twist song, which still stands as one of Goldfrapp's best songs. Disappointing.Mac Users like myself will only be treated to half of the disc content. The music videos on the disc are in some sort of format not recognized by OS X (likely WMP Video.) Also a shame but not a dealbreaker."
4,Riney's finest work to date,"Without a doubt, this is Sam Riney's work to date. I find every cut on this CD to be a pleasure, with Black Coffee being the pick of this litter. This blend of jazz with the rock beat leaves you wanting more. I am looking forward to more of this type of music in the future."
3,Fogging goggles,I bought this few years back and the negative thing about this product is that it fogs most of the time!I come to realize that I should have bought the goggles with turbo fan instead.
2,Review,"With the possible exceptions of ""Let the Music Play,"" ""The One,"" and ""Made in 2 Minutes,"" I did not think there was anything new or special about this cd that I have not heard before. Therefore the cd was monotonous and dull."
1,Waste of Money ! ! ! Do NOT buy it ! ! !,"If you are looking for good Speed Garage, buy Basslines or Groove Radio International. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD."
5,good slice of life fun,I enjoyed watching the series. If you like music or if you are a musician who appreciates anime and music. i would check out K-On
1,FDA Violators!!,"[...]That is a link on the FDA website to a letter the company received following an inspection... This liquid lecithin was one of the offenders. I wouldn't trust this if it were offered to me for free. Thanks to ""Male Nurse"" and ""JJ"" for the original ""watch out"" review and the link to the study in the comments on Male Nurse's review. I just wanted to make this more prominent. Buyer BEWARE!"
5,Good for the heart,"Fearn Nat Foods - Liquid Lecithin, 32 fl oz liquid. Good for the heart. A peoduct for many cooking uses as well as taking for colestrol control."
5,This is a must-read book for serious ufologists.,"Mr. Davenport has skillfully and logically presented a persuasive case that many UFOs may in fact be 'time machines'. For those who are knowledgeable about the bizarre aspects of many sightings (i.e. missing time, radiation effects, color/shape changes of objects, materializations/dematerializations, etc.), this work will allow many of the pieces to fit together. Using well-documented cases while drawing upon hypotheses of parallel universes and other dimensions developed by quantum physicists, ""Visitors from Time' makes a strong contribution to the field. While one might quibble with the author on some points (he still thinks the MJ-12 documents may be genuine), one cannot deny the merits of his thesis in the context of the historical record of UFOs"
3,A compelling case for futuristic humans,"But I was disappointed by the writers clearly misunderstood realizations.For instance, if the ufos are moving in time, it is ludicrous that that are in a separate reference frame from the earth so they have to precisely time when to reappear since earth is constantly orbiting the sun. I think it is far more reasonable that time travel would have a craft in our atmosphere to be in the same reference frame. Consider a person walking down a road and technically into the future as time progresses slowly. That person does not decouple from the earth for travel into the future. Similarly, from the converse situation of going into the past I cannot see why moving in time would cause you to materialize into the vacuum of space as the earth moved but you did not. Of course you would have moved since your movements and the earth's movement are synchronized in phase."
4,Good handbook for TAs,"I recommend that professors work through this book with Teaching Assistants--e.g. meet every other week over lunch to discuss a chapter or two. There is indeed an 'art' of teaching, and it's foolish and inefficient to expect each generation of university teachers to learn it all over again."
5,lovely tabby cat pictures!,"Lovely little book for young children telling the story of Tabitha Tabbitail, whose initial plans to catch the mice living in her teapot and make them into mouse pie are mellowed when she falls ill and they nurse her back to health. 'There are no mouse houses to let in Honeydell now...indeed some of the mouse houses are becoming a little overcrowded' (lovely picture here of a mouse-infested cuckoo clock.) The pages of text (often just a sentence or two) alternate with a colour illustration or b/w drtawing. No one can draw a tabby cat like Racey Helps!"
4,"Don't be misled -- this is NOT an ""atomic"" clock","This clock does not set itself using the radio signal from the U.S. Atomic Clock. It merely is packaged with batteries already installed and the time set at the factory. The use of ""atomic"" is clearly false advertising. It's a nice clock radio otherwise. Cool looking blue digits, a good ramp-up alarm, and dials to quickly set the time and radio frequency. The speaker is tinny sounding, but it works for background music or to wake you. But, if you're looking for a super-accurate clock that uses the NIST radio signal to automatic set itself, this isn't it."
1,complete rip-off,"The packaging says that the clock has ""automatic re-set"". This is a gross lie.When I bought this clock I thought I was getting a clock that would set itself by radio signal, like one I have. Instead, apparently RCA'c concept of ""automatic reset"" is that it has a battery back-up that will keep it from losing the time if the power goes off. WHAT A COMPLETE MISREPRESENTATION!!"
4,"I just love it! A couple of cons, but mostly pros!","So, for the most part, this little RCA fits the bill. Great, big numbers, easy to set the alarms due to a friendly wheel (rather than pressing that darn button and running thru the next 72 hours...sigh).However, this clock is far from intuitive. You actually may need to read the directions! AND, if the alarm goes off at the wrong time, (told you to read the directions!), unplugging it only makes the RCA frustrated, and it will sound like a fire siren. Perhaps punishment for not pushing the right buttons? ;pStill and all, great clock, wonderfully large face, great price, and what hubby wanted the most, no digital time-setting."
2,"Bright, Bright, Bright","Considering the features, I thought this looked like a great value for the money. The display can automatically dim, but it doesn't do so nearly enough. It's so bright that it illuminates the entire room. Perhaps a good choice if you like a night light."
3,Too Bright,"Although this alarm clock claims the display ""adjusts"" with the environment, it is way too bright in the dark of night... almost like a lighthouse. I was under the impression you could controll it. But it has a light sensor on top of that supposedly ""senses"" light. Other than that, it is a great alarm clock. We now keep a cover over it at night so we can sleep!"
3,Very bright display,"This is the only clock radio where I have ever had to read the instructions prior to figuring out how to use it. Once I did that, I found that this has lots of good features.The downside (for me) is that the display is very bright. The unit has a light sensor, where it automatically dims the display as a room darkens. It's still really bright."
3,clock radio,Product as described haven't had any problems so far haven't figured out how to set for no alarm on off days though otherwise good product
5,A wonderful story with vivid descriptions throughout.,"My wife and I enjoyed this book immensely. With the exception of Frank McCourt and his mother in ""Angela's Ashes,"" I can't remember when I've cared about a character in a book so much.Irene Leahy reminds me of my wife's Great Aunt Leah Joy, who lived in Massachusetts from around 1880 to 1966. She didn't live on a farm, but she was a tell-it-like-it-is rugged individualist who never married.Though this is a novel, it reads like a true story. Ann Mohin's descriptions leap off the page.I recommend this book to anyone who knows or would like to know what life on a farm is like or who wants to get to know a wonderful, independent lady."
5,The Farm She Was,A sensitive and beautifully written novel of an elderly person's memoirs. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.
3,GREAT CD,"For you Chicago fans, it's nice to hear them try big band, but they should really stick to rock. They have some good moments here, but more often than not, they are carried by the professional jazz players with guest appearances."
5,Great selection of hits for a modern big band,I love yhis kind of music. I recommend Night and Day _ Goody Goody _ Sophist. Lady _ Chicago. The album gives you the sensation that was recorded alive. You can dance with this music putting on the music on a large amp in an open space like the beach or a large garden. Is big band music.
5,THE BEST NEW VERSIONS OF SWING EVER!,"I really like to listen to jazz and swing, especially the original recordings, so when I heard this , I was amazed! If you like swing or most other kinds of jazz, you'll love this!"
3,"Chicago, Night and Day","Pretty good album, I like the sounds of a big band. However the last selection Take the A Train was good until getting towards the end it went into a strange direction almost psychdelic, that I hated, leave well enough alone."
4,Well-done (sort of) return to form offers a solid CD,"Chicago started out as TRAILBLAZERS, mixing jazz horns, funky & bluesy vocals, and Hendrix-esque guitar. On their 13th album they became TREND FOLLOWERS, with a nod to the disco craze, and then on to the 80s power ballad. Finally, although they still follow trends, Chicago strikes well with Night & Day.The 1990s saw young people respond to the resurgence of big band/jive music, thanks to Brian Setzer, Cherry Poppin' Daddies, and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Thankfully, Chicago dusted off their horns and pulled Bobby Lamm out of mothballs to compile this excellent album. For purists, it's not a complete return to form (because, sadly, Terry Kath is lost and gone forever), but to fans like myself who enjoyed their first dozen albums and believe in Jimmy Pankow's horn arrangements, this album will be most welcome."
4,A cherry on top of your Chicago collection,"A instant smile on the face as these tunes reel you in to experience Big Band--Chicago style. This album seems unexpected from the band yet makes complete sense. The band has all the style and talent to deliver some classic tunes in a charming and interesting way.These guys clearly ADORE what they do and it comes across in each of these songs. Chicago do not cover these songs, they interpret them with their characterisitc style and innovation. ""Don't get around much anymore"" is a bit of a flashback to Chicago's style of the 80's while ""Blues in the Night"" is delivered as pure blues rock. Chicago fans will recognise the characterisic horns woven into the tracks; those unfamiliar with Chicago just might get hooked!This may be like Marmite to some Chicago fans--love it or hate it. This album gets my vote any day!"
4,Great music by a great band,"I would have given it 5 stars if Robert Lamm had done all the lead vocals. His voice is more suited for these compositions. Still, this album very good and worth having."
4,Meditation and Kabbalah,Excellent introduction to the history of Kabbalah and how we can apply to our everyday lives.
4,Excellent Reading,Kaplan is a genius. He is well versed in Jewish Mysticism and the Kabbalah. A must read for all faiths as it is the fondation of all that is. Although some of Kaplans work is way beyond the PHD level in his writtings such as the book of formation. He offers diverse styles and intellectual levels. Someone is bound to find his writings they can relate too and understand. Meditation and the Kabbalah is an easy read but she read over time for the reader to truly enjoy the teachings. Kaplan does not write science fiction where you could read the book in a summer afternoon. He wants you to think. That is his gift.
4,Most useful for the Kabbalah scholar...,"I read this book after reading Rabbi Kaplan's books Jewish Meditation, as well as Meditation and the Bible (please see my reviews of both books). This text is the most esoteric, and therefore, the most difficult to grasp. It talks about historical figures in the history of Kabbalah meditation, as well as various methods an advanced Jewish meditative practitioner should use. I found this book to be interesting, but not very practical. The most practical of the three books I have mentioned here is Rabbi Kaplan's book Jewish Meditation (please see my review).Four out of five stars, for a very well researched, albeit esoteric text."
5,Excellent!,This book is an amazing journey into our minds and the minds of the Kabbalists. I highly recommend. I love the works of Areyeh Kaplan.
3,This book should be renamed: A history of some Rabbi's,"I thoguth the title was misleading - I was expecting this book to actually be about meditation. It is more like a research reference on the subject. I think it should be called: A History of Some Rabbi Guys and their Students, With Some Allusions to Meditation Techniques Here and There."
5,Great stand,"I bought this stand to use for occasional recording at home and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It's built a lot heavier than I expected and is simple to adjust with well built hardware. For home use, it will last a long time. For gigging, it might not hold up as well. I've since purchased another and it was consistent in quality with the first one."
4,On stage Stands 7701B,"This stand is a great deal. I had to make sure I double checked ALL the screws and tightened every joint thoroughly, before I placed my $500 mic on it.Only 4 stars because it is good, but not comparable to a $100+ stand, in a professional studio."
4,good stands,"decent stands, fairly stable and lots of range. holds up my mxl 990 mic (which is pretty heavey) without problems."
4,Tri-pod,"I like this tri-Pod stand but they only problem I have with it is that, it cant really balance well, its really long but i guess thats tha point is to have it long so that when recording while standing up it can reach to your body height. but overall its a good product nothing else to say about it. it connected to my mics n stuff so im pretty satisfied with it."
2,worthless w/o a mic holder,It's a nice stand but it's worthless with out a mic clip that does not come with it. Trying to decide if I want to send it back.
2,cheaply made cheap to buy,It is what it is. Cheap to buy and cheap in use. It won't last too long (2 yr) before you'll have to buy another because the screws strip out. Because they're molded into plastic you can't find simple replacement screws in the hardware store. The company will sell you another stand though.
2,MIC CLIP SOLD SEPERATELY!,"The stand is fine, but it DOES NOT come with a mic clip... Meaning: You cannot use this stand unless you buy a compatible mic clip (the plastic mechanism that grasps the microphone & attaches to the stand) - SEPERATELY."
1,missing click..,"so desapointed...just get it,,it dosent have the click..the video..fromon stage,,here,,show you the click,,but dosent have..box say u need to buy it...una mierda....no lo comprennn..."
2,"OK stand, poor paint.","The stand arrived today. Although it was not shipped in an outer box, the product box was undamaged. The stand inside, however, was a different matter. Both the boom and the stand itself are scratched and nicked from rubbing against other. The only protection included in the box was a small piece of bubble wrap, and this had shifted during transit.Perhaps some would say that I'm being overly critical, but an item should arrive looking new--not like a gorilla beat it against a rock."
1,"I bought a new stand and received a used, broken one :(","I bought a new product and I received a used one.I've chosen it because of the good reviews... Immediately I could see that the box was previously opened and broken & they used tape to seal it back in. And when I took out the stand from the box, it had a broken leg. I expected something wrong since the box had signs of being opened previously. So, somebody send it back because it was broken and they sell it to me as a new one... I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I'm definitely not buy from this seller again. :("
2,Does Not Include Mic Clip,"No where on the description does it say that the mic clip is NOT included. The only place is on the box AFTER you have received the item. There's no instruction (which is fine). But in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it.I bought this and have it shipped second day because I need to use it and now I can't because it doesn't come with a Mic Clip which I have to spend another 5-10 to get it plus shipping. The price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip. But without it, I felt cheated."
4,Seems like a good value,"Length:: 2:24 MinsAs you can see in the video, this is a fairly solid mic stand. It seems like a good value for the money. Also featured in the video are the RodeNT3 Condenser Microphoneand theBlue Microphones Kiwi 20 Foot Quad Microphone Cable.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. So, please vote (The ""Was this review helpful to you: Yes or No"" buttons) and leave a comment if you'd like, even if it's just to say, Hi!"") When you leave a comment, I can go to your reviews and pay you the same courtesy.Thanks, Claire"
3,Annoying legs!,The stand feels like the overall construction is nice but the legs on mine don't seem to stay locked anymore. I don't know if I got a defect or what but it's not helping me out much.
5,This is a great buy!!!,It is so simple to use and I have no problem putting it on stage. I think I may go ahead and get a few more for the guys in my band. This really is a great price for a great product. 10 out of 10 for me!!
2,Not strong enough for heavier mics,"The clamp at the intersection of the boom and the stand isn't strong enough for heavier mics. I over-tightened and stripped the innards-- great value for smaller stage mics, but not big-honk'n studio microphones."
2,boom is the sound it makes when your mic hits the floor,not sturdy enough at all to hold a studio condenser mic. will have to tie stones to the base to keep it stable. dish out another 20 bucks and get something more solid.
4,does the job,"It was a bit challenging to set it up first couple of times using it but after a few more tries, it's not that bad. The product is durable and adjustable. I use it mainly to connect the microphones and it's working pretty good."
3,Good Basic Stand,"For the price this stand will do the job. I find that most stands in this price range and even some more expensive do not hold up under use by many differnt people. My advice, buy cheap, they won't last anyway."
2,Didn't hold together.,"I bought this stand along with a mic clip to use for my Rock Band wireless microphone. After about 3 months of occasional use, the threaded piece that controls the height of the vertical extension stopped locking, and now the vertical adjustment doesn't work anymore.I still use the stand by only adjusting the boom part, but it's disappointing that it didn't hold together.If you're looking for something professional, look elsewhere."
1,Wallet Baiting,"I opened the boom stand today to discover that the stand is missing the microphone clip? Then on the side of the box I see a picture of the microphone clip and mounting bracket with a note proudly announcing SOLD SEPERATELY. What kind of third grade gotcha marketing ploy is this??? Clearly this company has little respect for the time of their customers to do something like this! I am on a tight schedule and having to order the microphone clip separately will cost me valuable time! For this reason I am giving this product 1 star. Anyone looking for a microphone stand should look elsewhere. Without the microphone clip, it's just a useless piece of metal. Thank you On Stage Stands for wasting my time."
1,Why would a microphone stand not include a microphone clip?,I am probably missing something but this just seems stupid to me. The product is useless unless I buy something else.
5,It works well,"I am very happy with this mic stand. It works well for my application. Versatile, portable, as well as sturdy. It does a good job."
4,Good for the Price,"These stand will suffice to hold standard weight mics. For the cost, $10, they are a very good value.This said, the fastening, the clamping, is a bit weak, e.g., the boom arm will start to slip and the mic will fall over time unless very tight. I hand tightened very tight, and I feel confident that this boom stand runs the risk of being stripping if one isn't careful. For this reason I give it 4 stars.Nonetheless, if this will generally be fixed and not adjusted repeatedly, it is an excellent product for the money."
5,Mic stand and boom at this price !!!,"Made of metal, all parts work as specified, good construction, setup is a breeze, I know it's just a mic stand but I have used some that were a little tricky, not this one. I highly recommend these stands especially at this price, why pay more for a mic. stand just because so and so uses it, you need it to do the job of holding your mic at a certain level. some prefer the heavy metal solid bases, these are the tripod type which I like. this does the job and like I said earlier it has the boom with it at a flea market price, great!!"
1,Does not fit with my yeti mic,Do not buy this stand if you have a yeti mic. It does not fit as the yeti mic is a bit loose when attaching it to the stand.
4,BE AWARE,"GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD QUALITY BUT BE AWARE THAT A MICROPHONE CLIP(shown attached to stand in ad) NOT INCLUDE!!!!HAD TO PLACE A SEPARTE ORDER AFTER STAND CAME IN."
4,save money buy it,the stand works perfect. easy set up and very sturdy. i use an mxl mic which is no more than 3 pounds and the stand doesnt tilt. if you go over 4 pounds you should definetly put something on the back of the stand to make sure it doesnt tilt. for the price its good
2,Bolt Stripped,"Had problem right away with the bolt that connects the two parts of the stand stripping. I think this stand would be fine for smaller microphones, but it did not seem to handle the weight of a large condenser mic and pop filter well."
2,Height adjustment clutch stopped working after a while,Height adjustment clutch stopped working just after couple of months and I don't even use it so often. I am not sure if I got a defective piece or is it that the quality is bad. Guess I will have to spend more money to get a decent product that works.
4,Relatively Sturdy and a good value,"I purchased this stand for light duty weekly use by our church worship band. This is a good value, budget priced stand (about $26 including shipping) but with a nice finish and smooth action of the mechanics. The boom and height adjustments provide good flexibility for mic placement. I bought a standard microphone clip separately for $5 at a local store. My stand was shipped bare box via UPS but with no damage to the packaging or stand."
3,So far so good for the price,I have not put it to much use yet but for the price it seems ok so far. If I could change only one thing it would be to get rid of the plastic parts. It will not last as long because of that. I would say if you are just going to set it up and leave it alone in your practice space it would last longer (That's what I got it for). In my oppinion it would not last long going to gigs all the time.
4,Great for Mic with no shockmount,"I am using this with a Yeti Mic w/shock-mount and am unable to extend it very far without the arm losing adjustment.Good quality stand just don't overload it like I have, Look for a HD mic stand if using shock-mounts etc"
4,"Great, cheap, would buy again.","I've been using it or about 5 months now and it hasn't let me down, it's cheap, and it works. I'm only giving it 4 stars because there isn't enough counter weight to make most of the boom poll useful."
5,"boom-""boom""","This boom is excellent! I am in a band with 8 friends, and this boom adjusts easily, is very sturdy for the price. Its well made,STRONG, adjusts easily ... I love it! .. I bought extra mic clips, as I have had them break before, so they fit securely on the boom, I am very happy with this and recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive boom for there mic stand..I have a large ""gig bag"" to keep my mic stand in. The boom slides easily ""down"" to fit comfortably in this bag I bought for my gear. Highly recommend it!"
4,"Nice, Affordable Stand","I have a Samson C03U condenser mic with a shock mount. I've wanted to get a stand for a while now and came across this one. It's price is what lured me in, but beware, you may need to get an adapter to screw your microphone on. The end in which the mic is attached to the stand was far too wide and I had to purchase an adapter, but once I did, the stand worked perfectly. Nice and sturdy."
5,perfect,"This is the most versatile stand available - I purchased it for vocals, allows you to position this right in front of your face for perfect sound, have used standing and sitting, I absolutely love it. very sturdy. I use with my Blue Yeti mic, have no need for shock mount."
2,OK product,"I did extensive research, and zeroed in on this particular model of On Star stands, because of the price, and name brand. I am not 100% sold on the quality of this particular model though. Yes, the price was very good. And perhaps that's why it's not as sturdy as I needed. I tried my SM58+pop screen on the boom, and it sagged. Tightened, re-tightened, adjusted the boom to distribute the weight properly, it still doesn't stay very well at where I want the boom to stay. I haven't even tried to mount my Rode NT-1A and its shock mount yet, which I suspect would be even worse.I guess price does dictate what you get, regardless of the name brand. That said, if you are looking for a light duty mic stand, this one would be perfect for you. But if you want to mount 2-3 items on the boom, spend little more and get a better quality."
4,Seems like a good value,"Length:: 2:24 MinsAs you can see in the video, this is a fairly solid mic stand. It seems like a good value for the money. Also shown in the video are theNT3 Condenser Microphoneand theBlue Microphones Kiwi 20 Foot Quad Microphone Cable.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. So, please vote (The ""Was this review helpful to you: Yes or No"" buttons) and leave a comment if you'd like, even if it's just to say, Hi!"") When you leave a comment, I can go to your reviews and pay you the same courtesy.Thanks, Claire"
3,"For the price, it's five stars; but compared to others, this is a three star stand.","It's perfectly fine for standard, fairly stationary use. We use these at my church, and they get moved around a little bit, but not much. For the price, they are surprisingly solid, and they work perfectly fine.Of stands in this price range, this is at the top of what I've experienced.It's easily adjustable, the screws stay tight once adjustments are made, it's light but not so light that it tips or blows over, the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobbling.Seriously, for those who don't need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around, this is the one to go with.If you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and/or going on tour, shipping around in airplanes or vans, etc., you will need to go up a notch or two in quality (and, sadly, price)."
4,if you are getting this with the Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB Microphone,"Ok, so if you are buying this with the Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB Microphone (I have no idea about any other microphones) in order for it (the microphone) to attach, you need to get a 5/8""Female to 3/8"" male adapter. Aside from that little qualm, everything works as advertised. The stand stands and the locks lock, what more can you ask for?"
3,works as advertised,just used it at a gig last night. overhead mic for drums. lightweight and a bit flimsy but good enough for someone who doesn't gig on a regular basis. if you are in a working band then spend more for something more substantial.
4,singer,For in home studio use this stand can't be beat for the price. Works great and does what it is supposed to do.
4,Good deal!,"After extensive research online, I decided to purchase this microphone stand due to its unbelievable price. I was skeptical at first about its reliability, but after a brief setup, I am convinced this was a great buy. The mic stand is not as stable as I like it to be, but if you don't move it around extensively, it will serve you well, especially as a studio mic stand. Please note that this stand doesn't come with a mic clip, but overall, the product serves its purpose well."
3,OK stand,"The assembly was easy to do. So far so good with the product. The product was not well packaged, and not sealed with a tape. Might be a used or previously opened item."
2,cheap piece of junk,"I don't know what this stand was meant to hold, but just a few minutes with myCAD M179 Variable-Pattern Condenser Microphoneand it starts to droop. The item has an overall cheap feel and I don't expect it last. I wouldn't buy it again; I should have purchased a more expensive, quality stand."
3,Okay quality...you get what you pay for,This mic stand does the job. Quality is sufficient for amateur uses. Price is not bad.
2,Took a while but it worked in the end,"When I got this I thought something wasn't right. I have the at2020 microphone this came goes with but the micrphone wouldn't go on. I figured out that you had to take out the inner screw in the desk mount the microphone comes with and screw it on the stand after that it worked fine, but it was a long process to figure it out."
2,Microphone Stand Review,"The clamps on the stand are not the easiest to secure, but then again it's not a very expensive stand.The thing that bothered me about this purchase, and the reason I took off points, is that the stand arrived with three scuff marks and a previously opened box.I do not know whether it is the manufacturer or Amazon who was at fault. But when I purchase a new item, I expect it to be new."
2,Boom clutch doesn't lock down tight enough,I second another reviewers' thoughts that these are of inconsistent quality. The one I got will not tighten down enough on the boom clutch. There's just no friction and the boom arm will not hold any weight at all. Basically useless. I guess that's why it costs $23. Save your money.
3,Came a little used!!!,"Well i got the On Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone Stand a day early..i was happy the box was super new no dents i opened the box everything was in plastic bag wrap looked fine,then when i looked as i set it up it had major scratches all on the plastic around the tripod area like it was used but when i look at the price i said okay ill take it overall its really heavy and sturdy!"
4,Very Nice Stand,"I recieved this yesterday from amazon.com and I couldnt be happier. I very rarely give things five stars a four from me is excellent. I opened it up and found no instructions, however really all that is needed is common since... it is very sturdy and worth every penny. Can adjust every angle of the mike's presense. I had one of those cast Iron, wiegh a ton based stands with two inch steal tubing for a boom... this new stand is every bit as sturdy and durable without all the wieght and it is very classy looking. Wish it would have come with a mike holder."
3,Very light weight - keep this in mind,"This is a fine stand for the price, but I was honestly surprised at how light it is. I honestly think On Stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price. I do use this stand, but I wish I would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future. It works fine, just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past."
1,Not For Samson G Track USB,"So I got this stand because there was a previous review saying that the Samson G Track USB would fit onto the stand, but... it doesn't fit. That or I'm trying to put it on wrong... =/ Does anyone else know if it works? Cause if it does, I'd love to know how."
1,"DUH, COMPLETE WITH ICE CREAM CONE TO HEAD","Well, I'm just curious whom the genius was that put this mic stand and boom package deal together? The boom's female end diameter was too big to even bite at all on the stand male end threads.And then all of you wonder why a lot of our jobs are going overseas, because you don't even have to speak English fluently to have gotten this one right, had you even minor skill in fitting things in the right hole. Or were you deprived of those kinds of toys when you were a kid to have led to this shortcoming?I'm disabled, so I hate having to deal with refunds and the whole nine yards of post office ridiculousness to reconcile such returns, and consequently am eating the cost on this one. Does Amazon screen these transactions at all, or are they equally negligent in these sorry excuses for comedic oversight?"
4,Hard to manipulate feet,"The only thing i had trouble with is having the ""feet"" balanced to stay in a certain place, it takes time to adjust it so it stays put but other than that its awesome"
2,Fool me twice,"So, this mic stand was recommended to me by an audio salesman to go with all of the other things I was purchasing. When it arrived it looked pretty solid, some of the joints maybe felt a little loose but that's to be expected. So it's working just fine for about three days and then the little nub on the end of the boom with the threads on it came loose and began to spin around, so my mic would flop around and only ever point down. I called the company about it and they were really nice and sent me a new one and even let me keep the old one. So I get the new one. about two weeks and the threads on the thing that keeps the boom in place strip, somehow they just become completely smooth. So I go back to using my old broken one and after a few days the same things happens.Just figured I should share my experience. I seemed to find all positive reviews about these stands but they SUCKED for me."
3,"Sturdy stand for LIGHT mics, throwaway clips!","I ordered this stand to do voiceover work with a Shure SM7B. Two things stick out -1. The tripod on base is not broad enough to hold up a microphone like the Shure SM7B UNLESS 1. One leg of the tripod is EXACTLY under the mic, and 2. The boom is NOT fully extended2. As has been mentioned in other reviews, the clip on the main spart of the stand WILL snap the first time you try to use it. I have not UNCLIPPED the clip on the boom again yet in fear that it will do exactly the same thing.On a POSITIVE note---this stand IS tall enough for any human being on the planet (I am 6'7"" and it has plenty of boom to spare)."
4,Great,"Satisfy my expectation. It's strong, easy to use, compact when folded. Good!Too bad it doesn't come with mike holder."
2,Tippy,"I wasted my money on this. I needed it to hold a blue snowball, and it kept falling over. Not really worth it."
3,Ok stand but tips,The stand is made well but it tips with a heavy mic when extended to center of piano. So be careful if you have a heavy mic.
4,Very compact and light weight,"I wasn't sure how light and compact these things were, but for the price, I figured I'd try them. They are about 1/3 smaller than my previous boom mic stand and probably 1/2 the weight. This is perfect as 2 of these were purchased to act as speaker stands for a portable PA system. The other 2 are for mics for the PA system. I just ordered an onstage bag for these stands to tote them around as needed. For the price, I'm very happy with them."
5,Great reference book,"This book was a great reference for us, with a recent job loss and not a clue as to how to handle the 401-K. It gives cautionary tales about what penalties you will incur for withdrawing funds early, so you know what you are getting into IF you still decide to go ahead and take the money out. It is not reccommended."
4,"If I Knew Then What I Know Now From This Book,...","If I had this book when I left my former employer, I would have known better what to do with my 401(k). I would have avoided so many money mistakes and, most importantly, paid less taxes. The author explains in plain language what the average person should consider when deciding on investment options and how those decisions affect their financial future. It's a quick read and a good reference. Highly recommended."
2,Taking Your Money Out,"I purchased this book for clarification of ""normal"" removal of money from tax-deferred accounts. Unfortunately, the money spent was a complete waste for that purpose. I could find no mention, not a single comment, about this all important topie. ""Normal"" removal in my definition is removing reasonable sums of deferred money from accounts, between the ages of 59 1/2 and 70 1/2. While I have since discovered what I needed to know, I find it most odd that there is no mention of this topic.That said, IF you wish information on the topic of either removing deferred money BEFORE 59 1/2 or AFTER 70 1/2, I would rate the book a 3 star on those issues. However even there, I would dig for details on some topics and find only general information.As they say ""the devil is in the details"" and that certainly is true when it comes of tax-deferred investments and the IRS. While I have been happy with Nolo Press books in the past, I would keep looking before buying this one."
5,Crucial Information,This book contains must have information for anyone owning an IRA. I had a previous version and wanted to keep current as I approach the magic age. This book tells you how to avoid fines and penalties from the dastardly IRS. Keep as much of your hard earned savings as possible for as long as possible by reading this book several times then saving it for future reference. I also marked many pages for my beneficiaries just in case. Do yourself a favor and invest in this book.
2,Cheap,Some of the keys do strange things. An example is the S key does not always work and then when it does it seems to stick.It is usable but annoying.Bill
5,Excellent seller and purchase,"Having served in the Aleutian Islands during 1969-1970, I have always been fascinated by the military history of the area. I found remnants of WWII on the beaches of the island I was stationed on(Shemya). I had bought a paperback edition of this book back in the 70's and lost it somewhere along the line, so when I found this hardcover edition, I was very pleased. The price was bargain basement for a book in very good condition. The seller shipped it very promptly and I couldn't be happier with this transaction. Thank you WonderBook and Amazon.com from a very happy customer."
3,Scrapbook of Blondie photos and articles,"This 500+ page book is more or less a scrapbook of Blondie articles, stories , and photos reprinted in a 500 page text.Though I am so glad there is another Blondie book out there ( first one in 20 years) . I do want to say there are inaccurate dates for the photos in this book. However this is a book all Blondie fans should have as it does havemany pics that are very rare . Many many fans and reporters contribute to this homage to a band that has influenced everyone from Madonna to No Doubt. There are no color photos in this collection. Which was a disappointment. But kudos to Allan Metz for putting this together. I do think he should have waited a few more months to put this out to coincide with the new Blondie Cd and to have pics of the recent Blondie"" Camp Funtime ""tour. But this will give the fans something until the new Blondie CD is released."
5,Cookie sheet,"These are so great, they cook evenly and clean up is to easy. I love baking cookies with my daughter and needed some new pans."
1,Save your money,I purchased this with the hopes that it wouldn't cause the food to stick however that was not the case. I ended up throwing it away as it got so dirty and no matter what I did it would not clean up.
4,A collection of articles regarding yacht design,"The book is written by multiple authors, one subject each. As a result, the book does not always proceed in a very logical order and the quality of the chapters is varying.J.A. Keuning (Delft University) gives a very good review of performance prediction of yachts. The structural design part is also quite good, but there are some chapters which are of very little use, for example the mathematical background to fairing of hull surfaces.At the end of each chapter is a list of references, which is very helpful since the book is too short to go into very detailed explanations.The book is not a tutorial on the subject of designing yachts. It is more like a set of articles regarding different aspects of yacht design. To get the most out of this book some basic knowledge of basic naval architecture is required."
1,Try Inter-Library Loan Instead,"Given the cover and the price, the expectation was at the max - this would be the ""must have"" book on yacht design. Alas - it is expensive, but not due to any extraordinary value. What you are paying for is a smallish paperback that is printed on demand. Unless you are preparing for your orals for a PhD in naval architecture, don't waste your money here... There are lots of other excellent books on the subject of yacht design at every level of technical sophistication available from amazon.com at a fraction of this book's price."
3,good for looks,"Finally pulled the trigger on one of these bad boys. First impression after turning it on was extreme excitement as i pointed the laser at various objects. The laser is well seen. Outdoors is a different story. In daylight, the laser could not be seen at the range. After putting about 50 or so rounds through my 1911 45acp, I noticed how the carbon buildup in the front of my pistol made the laser useless. I've spent some time cleaning it now, and still have not gotten it to where it's as clear as when I first got it. I still think it's hella cool, but as I've said, after a few rounds, the carbon will build up over the laser. I'm still happy with buying it."
4,Works Like a Champ,"As with everyone, I needed a couple extra ports. This card installed easily and the machine sees it as soon as something is plugged in. No issues and speed are where they should be. Nice card for the money to toss in for some extra space."
3,Great stories...but a little too vulgar at times...,"but that is just my opinion. I was hoping to find a collection of romantic, tasteful erotic stories...and there is an element of those things in these stories...but the author frequently uses words that you would expect to see in some trashy porno rag. Granted that is probably a turn-on for a lot of people, but for me I prefer sensitive, tasteful references to genitalia, especially imagery, which the author includes at times (in one story referring to the woman's genitalia as a ""tender bud""). I read these stories alone, and I couldn't imagine reading them with a partner or having a partner read them to me. I would be so turned off."
1,I could have done better then this......,I bought this book thinking it would be a great way for my husband and I to re-explore our sexual relationship but I was very disapointed. Ms. Lloyd's idea was good but she should have taken the time to write stories to excite and tease. Her stories read more like afternoon quickies then something I want to share with some one I love dearly.
2,"Too thin, in size and content","I felt a bit deceived as soon as I saw the size of the book. Yes, it has 100+ pages, but the format is small, and the print large. The stories are very short and predictable. A perhaps interesting setting which invariably leads to a sex scene. Yes, they are often arousing, and indeniably well written, but I miss that extra bit which would make them excellent. I tried to select one story, that would be good enough to show my partner, but failed."
3,I miss the dance songs and not much on ballads,"CMB have wonderful voices and this album does showcase it and also their growth in trying out new songs which is ok, but I miss the dance ones."
5,Awesome!,"This CD is fabulous! A must have for the CMB enthusiest!Sexual Capacity, The Earth The Sun The Rain and Tonite Tonite are by far the best tracks on the album but all are well done. This group of guys can SING!I HIGHLY recommend!(...)"
4,Sol's Other People,"I have several Writing craft books by this author. I wanted to read something by him to see if he could not only teach, but write. I was not disappointed. I read it as a writer, instead of a reader, to study his technique. But ended up absorbing it as a reader. It is written from each main character's POV and I found that very interesting. Stein was able to create a distinctive voice and POV for each character and weave his story so I understood how each one felt and absorbed each character's struggle .I really enjoyed the experience.This is one of his earlier books and I will be purchasing a more current one and comparing how his style has evolved.Teresa Reasor"
5,A Thought Provoking Journey,"Mary Kay starts the novel with ""On October sixteenth, Holly Ann Loftin died"". Thus begins a thought provoking journey into the unknown. Holly Loftin is a poor women who spends all her time and money helping out people less fortunate. The man she meets, Oliver Carey, is from an ""old money"" family. Something draws them together from the first moment their eyes meet on a crowded airplane. Holly knows things about Oliver that she shouldn't, and can't seem to explain, and this in return drives Oliver nuts. This story is fantastic and is a lot of fun to read. Mary Kay uses lots of love and laughter in telling the story."
1,"Really, Geraldo!",Geraldo would have been better off not to expose so much of himself because he comes off as unlikable. I enjoy Geraldo on tv and perhaps he might write a better book in the future. Hope so.
4,Dare to Dream,We need to make our dreams a priority not just want-to-be dreams - pursue them with passion.
4,"practical, quick and easy to read - motivation on the go","I have read a number of Maxwell's books, this one appeared to be short on content but turned out to be a great pick-me-upper like the first cup of coffee in the morning..."
1,What a disappointment,"Considering the price of this book, I expected there to be some content. My suggestion would be to save your money and check the book out from the library; you can read it in about thirty minutes."
3,Okay but unexciting,Not a big fan of Maxwell but this is a good book to provide motivation to reach your dreams but pretty basic uninspiring stuff. Okay ...
5,make your own smartfood popcorn,"Love this flavoring--all of them are actually pretty good. I sprinkle it on regular foods as well--not just popcorn. It is just salty and cheesy enough for a delicious treat. Also, the bottles last forever because a little goes a long long way! Enjoy :)"
1,This stuff is the PITTS!!,"This stuff is the PITTS!! It had very little flavor and as another reviewer said it takes 1/2 a bottle to flavor the corn if you are using a hot air popper, even with their suggested heavy PAM dose....I threw the other half of the container in the trash.I tried Kraft Mac and Cheese with no luck, it just rolled off the popped corn, due to that being not a fine enough powder.It would be nice to find a very fine powder that adheres to the popped kernels like the Popcorn Factory. My search continues.....maybe Barry Farms Cheddar Cheese powder?.....we'll see......"
5,So Good,Discovered this at a local movie theater and will never eat popcorn without it again. It is sooooooo good.
5,Great.,"Comes with 6, bring 1 to the theater with you.Tastes good, it really adds to the bland flavor of regular popcorn. The best of the Kernal Season's flavors imo.Haven't tried it on anything else. They have other flavors for that."
1,"95% imagination, 5% cheddar cheese flavor",Yup you might taste cheddar if you do not mind dumping 1/2 bottle in your popcorn. You would be better off purchasing a good brand of cheddar cheese and grating it on top of your popcorn.
1,Not that great,"not a whole alot of cheddar taste. mostly salt. if your looking for seasoning to mimic the taste of white cheddar that you would find in a bad brought from the supermarket, this product wont do it."
2,Meh.,"After having to add butter to make it stick anyway, the cheese powder is kind of a gross addition. If you're expecting the same taste you get from pre-packaged flavored popcorn, this isn't it. The kids like it enough, but I can't eat it."
5,Best Seasoning,I love this white cheddar seasoning. I used to get it at my local grocery store and then they stopped carrying it so I had to order online. I use it for popcorn but also when sataying spinach and it makes spinach taste creamy and yummy without a bunch of extra fat.
4,Good!,"I thought I was purchasing one container and it was a whole box - which is fine but I still haven't even finished the first shaker yet. Taste is good - it doesn't ""stick"" to my air popped popcorn however - but still provides it a little extra flavor."
1,More salt then cheese,"After trying this product in theaters several times, I decided to order some for home use. What I received is not anything like I had enjoyed in the theater. There was almost no cheese flavor and the product appeared to be mostly fine salt. I was very disappointed."
1,"Great Seasoning, Lid Designer should be shot",I love the seasoning. But when you take off that stupid plastic lid to remove the white plastic paper on the top of the bottle. Becareful you can season your shirt just fine. Absolute moron who designed that lid.
3,Slammers revisited,"This is very much a book in the Slammers series. This might be slightly superior to the others since all the main characters are introduced separately in a short story each, obviating the need for a long drawn-out bloodbath as in most Slammer stories. For most of the book the actual combat vehicles are missing, although these make a surprise entrance in the last chapter, apparently more for sentimental reasons than for the sake of the story.In short: if you like the Slammers buy this. If you don't know what the Slammers are leave it in the bookstore."
4,Makes sense!,This is a relatively short lesson on the science of eating and how your body works. It makes sense and I have taken away some good points from it which I am trying to put to use. I have recommended this to friends and family.
1,Missed Opportunity,"Unfortunately, this CD is not what it's supposed to be, namely the last concert by the original ASIA lineup. Instead, it's cobbled together from shows in 1982 and 1983, with sound quality that's one step above a bootleg. ""Midnight Sun"" begins in the middle of the song, and ""Don't Cry"" has the opening from the studio version tacked on. Unless you are a hard-core original ASIA fan, pass this dud up."
5,Love the McKettricks,"This is the book before the triology of the McKettric books about Jessie, Rance and Keegan. I read this one after the others and it was so good. I feel like I know al these guys and I just love this family. They are like I said in other reviews of them: funny, very rich, giving, compassionant, romantic, troubled.. So worth reading all of these modern time McKettricks."
5,fantasy,The way the book kept coming and going back in time and to the present. Was done very well kept me wanting to see what was next
4,A Good Fun Love Story,"I enjoyed Millers creative storyline used in this book, I really didn't want the book to end. It is a romance novel and somewhat predictable but a good fun read! Who doesn't like s good love story??"
3,dissappointed and robbed,I agree I loved the first 4 books and was robbed when I get to the Sierra's Homecoming and it is present day. Good grief what a dissappointment. I read the next 2 books but I did not like the back and forth of generations so I will not read anymore of these.
3,sierras homecoming,i enjoy reading the author linda lael miller. she does a great job with the mckettricks series. all these books need to be read in order to reall enjoy them
