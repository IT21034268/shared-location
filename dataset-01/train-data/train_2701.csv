2,Somewhat Disappointed,"Didn't receive product. When I inquired about order status, my money was promptly refunded. While I was pleased about receiving a refund so quickly, I was never given any explanation as to why my order was never received. I don't know if the item was out of stock or if the order was never filled. I would have been willing to wait for the item if given that option; however the refund was issued without any communication from the seller."
5,Good deal for price,"A good-looking, basic water gun that is reasonably priced. Bought 15 of these for a water gun birthday party. Each child got one and every one of them LOVED theirs."
2,Unimpressed,"Once one has heard Juana Zayas's recording of the Etudes (M&A CD891), it's difficult to find much that's satisfying about any other. Lortie's isn't bad but, with all due respect to Ms. Gerber, his doesn't sound impressive next to hers. A fortiori, Fialkowska's sounds even less impressive. She does not seem able to maintain the tempo in the slower, more songlike, etudes; the piano sounds too close to the microphone, and, worst of all, the technicians let the piano go a bit out of tune."
2,A very basic introduction to the atheistic defense,"This book addresses the traditional arguments for the existence of God. Simple examples are used to illustrate the key points. However, given the recent arrival of more technical books which focus on the appearance of design in nature (e.g., The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, The Mind of God, Nature's Destiny), there probably is not enough detail in the discussion to win over the scientifically inclined agnostic reader. On the other hand, there are also chapters that deal specifically with Christianity and Jesus that are worth reading. All in all, Johnson offers unique perspectives that anyone who asks ""Does God exist?"" should deal with."
1,Swiss cheese--lots of holes.,"Bad title, bad book. It leaves great black holes in logic and fails to include basic ideas. The reader is left wondering why the author has left one subject unfinished and leapt on to another. If one actually wants to debate, one is likely to come off poorly using this work.An excellent work that actually provides all the ammunition one could want is George Smith's ""Atheism : the case against God."""
2,Short of it's Goal,"While this book makes some strong statements against Chirstainity being a foolproof religion. It does not touch at all on other religions like Islam, Buddism, or Hinduism. When in a debate you must have as much information on your subject as possible, and this book is well short of that goal."
1,Waste of money,I bought this game for my kids. They finished the game in 10 minutes. Not much gameplay. No fun at all.
1,Couldn't Even Get To Page 100,"As a dog lover, this book caught my eye on the shelf of my local bookstore. I wish I'd left it there.Several reviewers said it gets better as it goes along, both in this installment and in the series. I can't get that far. Every time I pick the book up to read it, I end up falling asleep with the book in my hand after a few pages.Every character comes across as grating and unlikable. I find everyone referring to the female dogs as ""bitches"" annoying (proper or not). I hate when authors give their female heroines small children that add nothing to the story other than to be dragged around with their mothers on sleuthing expeditions. There's just nothing about this book that makes me want to keep going to find out if it gets better.I have a friend who just adopted a poodle puppy. I'm sure she'll appreciate the gift and like it better than I did."
4,A Pedigree to die For,"It is a very enjoyable book - BUT - like her other books, the author tends to get too much into the lecturing mode about spoos. I am a long time owner of standard poodles and even for me who enjoys reading about them, it got to be too much at times. Otherwise, it is a great story and I love the sense of humor that runs throughout the book."
3,"mediocre, at best","I like action games. So when I play an action game and don't have a fun time, I know something is seriously wrong.First of all, let's talk about the reason the game is getting at least SOME good points. The graphics in the cutscenes are amazing. I love watching them. People who love anime will definitely love the cutscenes.The game is pretty boring because walking through castles and dungeons all the time gets pretty old. It's not like Zelda or something, where that kind of setting is REALLY fun. This is just ordinary, predictable action. If I remember correctly, the computer puts you in the dungeon of their choice.There's plenty of enemies to fight throughout the game but really, most of them feel exactly the same and that's why the game loses points for me. You have to make an action game fun until the very end and this game doesn't do it, unfortunately."
1,Great idea....poor execution,"I bought this to keep from blowing my elbow out throwing popups to my two boys. It worked exactly as advertised for two whole days until the fabric strapping that holds the ball broke loose from the rivets. I read reviews that mentioned this but figured I'd take the risk (knowing I'm a ""handy"" kind of guy and could probably jury rig something if it broke). I took some electrical wiring, connected it to the two rivets and duct taped the thing together. Doesn't look great but it gets the job done. I expected more from Easton and am disappointed in the workmanship."
2,"""Ok"", but there's better","Difficult to get consistency b/c of ""touch"" required to guage distances. My band lasted longer than some other reviews posted, but still broke after one year and replacement bands are not available. It also requires two hands to operate so if you are launching flyballs to players they can't throw on the fly.I would recommend the Accubat - twice the cost ($60), but a heavy-duty racquetball type of device that allows you to have a glove on to catch incoming balls and then just drop the ball from your glove to your Accubat as you swing. This also requires a little touch, but is much easier to establish comfort and consistency while providing the efficiency that the slingshot doesn't."
2,IUseful but throwaway training aid,"The Easton Hyperlaunch is a useful training aid particularly for training young players. But it has one problem. The sling shot will either wear out or break after approximately 1,000 shots and Easton does not sell replacement sling shots.While it is supposed to be able to launch a ball 200 feet, the most I have seen anyone attain is 100 feet. I don't know how Easton was able to attain 200 feet because juat to get 100 feet requries the latex sling be drawn back about as far as it can go.While it can be used to launch both fly balls and ground balls. there is no spin on the balls so it doesn't quite simulate a ball coming off a bat But it will do.In order for the coach to get the proper distance takes quite a bit of practice. Some coaches can throw the ball as far as the Hyperlauncher so it may not be worth the cost. It is much more accurate than trying to hit a ball with a bat."
3,Item is Okay,Received the item in excellent time. The launcher did break within 20 minutes of the first use. We did return the item and received excellent customer service. We returned the item for a second launcher and so far the launcher works great. We did receive the second launcher with a whole in the sling shot materail and we are not sure if it is a defect or a whole that is meant to be since the whole has frayed edges.
1,Tube and ball strap break,"I purchased one a few years ago, and it worked great for the first 3 practices. It does an excellent job on traning infielders and catchers on handling high pop-ups. The ball strap then broke where it connects to the tube, make it useless. I waited a few years and bought another one, and this one broke at the tube after about 45 balls. It works extremely well until it breaks. It would be one of my favorite training tools if they could figure out how to make it more durable."
1,Good Idea! BAD Product!!,"Bought this Easton Hyperlaunch Ball Thrower and liked it, until the rubber broke after a few 100 uses. After I found out you couldn't get replacement bands, I then realized I am now the owner of a piece of garbage! Very disappointing product from Easton."
1,"Great Idea, poor workmanship","I read all the reviews for this product and still purchased, because the concept was solid. Still after, maybe, 150 uses over two seasons (end of one season, the beginning of the next) the launch strap disintegrated. Too late to get my money back. Not too late for you to read this review."
5,"the next ""big thing""",Terrance Hayes is a name you will see again. I promise you.An earlier edition of this book came into my hands shortly after I worked with this wonderful poet at a seminar for younger poets. A wonderful first collection. So human it hurts. Get it now that it's back in print!
4,Great APS Compact,"The Elph Lt270/Ixus Z-65 doesn't give you the rock solid feel of the Elph II's stainless steel casing, but it has 2.7x zoom that outclasses Elph II's 2x. However its a little gem in both looks and feel in its own right. The viewfinder shows the different APS formats (C, H & P) and the flash capacity is above average compact flashes. You can even customize your Elph Lt270 via several custom functions like turning off the automatic rewind. As the flash pops up when the camera is switched on you have to be careful not to hold your fingers over the flash. This kit is a great value with everything included that you need to get started."
4,Small and conveniant!,"I have one of those very expensive Nikon's, it takes fantastic pictures, but it is big and very heavy! I needed something I could carry around in my purse for those ""I wish I had a camera!"" moments. Having a son they are a lot more frequent! I decided to try the Elph, and when I got it I was suprised how light and small (maybe I'm just used to big and heavy?) but I decide to hurry and test it to make sure it took decent pictures. When I got my pictures developed I was very pleased. I tried it in low light and bright outdoors, it did well on both. Of course, with all small cameras, because of where the flash is located, you cannot avoid red eye. Only the flashes that detach can, so that is to be expected. Other then that it is perfect for what I need it for. I would certainly suggest it to anyone."
4,Great replacement camera,"I have a 10 year old Minolta 35-mm camera that I've just about beaten up. So, I borrowed this camera from my sister for my trip to Europe last month. The color and B&W pictures came out great. I especially loved the panoramic feature for those broad Italian landscapes and the great outside shots of Versailles and the Louvre! The only time the pictures didn't come out nice ... and this is my only complaint ... was when I was taking shots in a dark church or taking night shots. More often than not, those pictures came out blurry or grainy. Maybe if I used different film (I only used 400 speed while I was in Europe), or held my hand steadier it wouldn't have been a problem -- I'll have to play around with it a little. Otherwise, it is a great camera! Perfect for traveling -- light, compact, and inconspicuous. In fact, I plan on buying one for myself before my next trip abroad!"
3,not bad,"I have owned this camera for about six months now, and overall I like the compact design, the variety of features it offers and the pretty decent zoom. If you also have a Canon EOS, slow your trigger finger, since the autofocus of the elph is not quite as snappy as the one on your high performance SLR. The flash is very limited in range, so this is ideal for indoor shots at smaller parties, but not at bigger events where you want to cover some distance. Twice I have had problems with fresh APS film involuntarily rewinding and popping out of the camera as used even though only one picture had been taken, but that may have been an issue with the film rather than with the camera. The zoom and autofocus use up quite a bit of battery juice, and the power will go pretty much without warning, so if you travel, have extras handy."
1,Too much hype over this camera,"Alot of my photos taken at night are grainy or blurry. This camera is ok, not worth all the hype it's getting. Not to mention developing doubles will cost you about $15 per roll. I would stick with digital or 35mm over this."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I have purchased two Elph LT270s: one for me and one for my mother-in-law. She loaded her film, but it wouldn't advance and the film door jammed -- absolutely NO Trauma -- that is until I was sure I could get it opened and broke the latch. Even after replacing the little door, it jammed again with a new roll of film. Then mine wouldn't advance the film one afternoon. I replaced the film and it works fine, but it just seems too finiky of a system for carefree point and shoot fun."
1,Nice Marketing - Bad Results,"My wife and I are very disappointed in this product. Pictures were very grainy using both 100 & 400 ASA film and the red eye reduction should have been labeled ""Give Everyone Intense Red Eyes"". Bottom line, don't even think about buying this cameria. It [stunk]!"
3,Danse Macabre,"Since their first album, Media, the band has progressively been moving towards the new wave genre, and further away from it's post-hardcore and punk origins. Even now, after the release of their fifth album, it is still sounding more experimental and new wave than anything they'd previously made. However, at this point the band was not quite at the balance of electronica and indie rock that I like. The synths were constantly pounding--and don't get me wrong, I do like the sound--but it gets a little obnoxious after a while. At only nine songs, Danse Macabre lasts thirty-five minutes, only thirty-four seconds shorter than their longest album. It's also worth mentioning that this is the only album they've made that doesn't deal with casual sex, strip clubs, erections, the process of birth, or any of the other weird things they normally sing about. With the exception of violence..."
5,The Faint Rocks...and so much more,"Simply said, The Faint rocks. Danse Macabre is only a small taste of their capabilities. The lyrics are catchy and thought provoking, as well as the music being fantastically organized and easy to listen to. They aren't quite like anything else available, and their music is an experience in itself. Their energy and talent are endless, and their music reflects The Faint's ability to please a crowd while still staying true to themselves. It's quite unfortunate that not more people have discovered the world behind The Faint's music. The Faint is just plain amazing, and you won't be disappointed with any of their CDs."
4,Do you like Gwen Stefani???,"If you do enjoy No Doubt and the only reason you are considering buying a Faint CD is because you paid entirely too much to see no doubt play and The Faint just happened to be there, do me a favor and don't buy it! On the other hand, if you really know what's up, you OBVIOUSLY already have this CD, and if you don't you really need to get it to fill in your collection. If you are a first time Faint buyer though, I would recommend ""Blank: Wave Arcade"" because it is their best album... Also if you like danse music- you will LOVE the faint"
2,Amatuers,"Sounds like Depeche Mode? Vocals like the Cure? These statements are quite a stretch for this amatuerish album. There's fine line between retro and just plain untalented, and this winds up on the untalented side. Want real retro cool talent, try Iris's Awakening album and leave this to the teenagers who don't know any better."
5,Danse Macabre - Beaty,"Danse Macabre is one of my favorite albums ever. It has a great style of beaty synth, vocals, guiatrs, and bumping beats. It is an amzing sounds that definately grows on you the more and more you listen to it. The Faint is a perfect example of modern New Wave-Core. This is definately a great cd to have, and to dance to in your friend's hot, sweaty basement with your friends, if you a fan of that kind of thing."
2,Less daft punks,"2 1/2Like a polished version of a rawer predecessor, some, but not much of the influential underground dance-rock has stayed potent while the rest stays encased in fevered nostalgia for those with personal associations."
5,So Retro it's Fresh,"The Faint is one of those great 80s bands that never actually existed in the 80s. They're like a cross between Adam Ant, Camper Van Beethoven, and Bauhaus. The Faint is a wonderfully refreshing breath of stale air. Not dance music, but awesome to listen to. Guitars mix with heavy sythns and a good singing voice (deep but at times similar to David Lowery, the guy from Cracker) to produce several great tracks. The songs all have subject matter and a certain intensity about them that only grows with each subsequent listen. My favorite track is the conductor, which piles on a deeply electronically distorted voice on top of some epic guitar rifs.It also makes an old fart like me feel cool because all the young Emo punks listen to it."
4,Listen to the Sirens,"The Faint follow up their immensely enjoyable Blank-Wave Arcade with another burst of strong new wave influenced tunes. Things are much smoother this time around, the keyboards are hefty and the vocals enhanced into Gary Numan territory. Gone are the dissonance and random noise bursts, instead Danse Macabre works hard at providing tunes that are almost indistinguishable from their new wave progenitors 20+ years ago. ""Glass Danse World"" is this year's ""Worked Up So Sexual,"" an irresistable collage of strong keyboard hooks and perfect timing that subverts its dance-floor intentions. ""Your Retro Career Melted"" and ""The Conductor"" are also wonderful fun. Devoted followers will certainly enjoy this strong effort, while those who found The Faint's previous records too strange could be lured into the fold as well. In either case, few will be disappointed."
4,Other Bands Like the Faint,"This CD is great. Their live show is even better. They prove that new wave is back. If you like this you should check out some other new wave bands like ladytron, the aeffect, and basement jaxx."
4,fun stuff to listen to while commuting,"i spent about two weeks this past summer riding my bike around fort collins listening to this, and only this. it is excellent urban-bicycling music, and as you can well imagine, us urban cyclists need all we can get. that's the thing, though...i don't like to dance, and since this is music that must be moved around to, i can really *only* listen to this on my bike, which limits the effect it can have on me. as for what it sounds like, well, try this analogy on for size: the faint sound EXACTLY like god lives underwater, minus the hi-fi production and sped up a good bit. everything, the vocals, the sounds, the rhythms...all GLUW. not necessarily a bad thing, considering that studio polish and slow songs were two of GLUW's most frustrating characteristics."
3,Describing this is very possible...,"If I wanted to hear old New Order music I'd put in Substance. The music on this album is great, but it's only new to listeners not familiar with the mid-80s new wave dance scene. To praise this music as somehow revolutionary is ridiculous. It's a solid homage to an underappreciated style. Well executed and conceived, but beyond description? Please..."
2,"It's not you, it's me.","Faint, I just have to tell you. I don't think we're right for each other. I know that your really popular, and a lot of people like you, but for some reason, I just can't. I don't know what it is. People say you're like The Cure, but Robert Smith's voice and music has some warmth to it. When I listen to that, I think ""Hey, I'd slice my wrists with some pre-heated razors."" But when I listen to your music, I think ""I wonder if I could build a robot to zap me into oblivion."" It's funny; I like you more in the remix album, becuase they don't degrade your voice so much as they do in ""Danse Macabre."" To tell you the truth, I find you unlistenable sometimes. Hey, don't look so sad. Look how many people love you! I wanted to. I did. And don't think I'll ever forget the night of ""Glass Dance."" I love that song. And I'll always have it with me. Bye."
2,Don't think this lives up to hype,"I really have to question the claims of this product. While it didn't cause any ill side effects, it was effective in producing the result it claims it can. So I'd say this was a waste of money."
3,NEUTRAL,"I TOOK PYCGNOGENOL FOR 4 MONTHS AND DIDN'T NOTICE ANY RESULTS AT ALL, NOT NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT ON MY SKIN, SO I WON'T BUY IT AGAIN."
1,Not worth the money,Better options are available. Nothing special about this. I don't think it is better than buying locally. Do some research and talk to your nutritionist.
5,Great Album,A classic blues album with from Albert Collins. It could use a remastering job for sure but definitely good to have in your collection. It sounds a lot better on vinyl I might add.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my Kindle. It had evidentally been scanned and no one looked at the final product. A great deal of it is unreadable and some of it can only be guessed at. I only paid $2.99 so I'm not going to bother to return it. However, I won't be purchasing any other ""old"" e-books unless they are free."
4,excellent!,"Hi, I am a pediatrician who loves reading books by doctor-writers. I almost finished The Emperor of All Maladies, but then switched to this book, and this book has fascinated me and I think it does a really good job explaining WHY cancer happens! I highly recommend it for anyone who is puzzled with why we have to have cancers. . ."
5,"Peter, Paul and Mary Songbook",I was very happy to find this book still in print. It has many of the songs that made the trio famous. It is especially good for guitar players.
2,Disapointing,"I had so looked forward to this book and was so disappointed. I'd really wanted to see more tabs and the few given are incomplete, not well done, or both. It is nice to have for the words and chords, but these can be had on the net for free.Wish they'd made are real effort and not just gone though the motions, but then they have sold out a long time ago."
3,Beautiful Pots but a little too small,"I have received the package yesterday. The pots look beautiful but, a little too small. (The ""Product Features"" described the pots should be ""5"" x 7"" x 13"" "" and, the actual size of the pots is 3.5"" x 3.5"" x 11.5"", the original package of the pots is 4.75"" x 6.75"" x 12.75"" so, even the original package is smaller then the product size described.)I have not planted the seeds yet so, no comments on the seeds for now."
2,Beautiful-but too small,"When you purchase a planter you expect to be able to grow something in it. These pots, while very beautiful just aren't big enough to support a healthy sized plant. Each pot is 3"" in diameter at the top and about 4"" tall. But they work fine as little containers to put other things in (I use them to hold candy and various things on my kitchen shelf). Like I said, very pretty but I can't use them for their original purpose."
2,"Ok, but not as straight forward","While this isn't rocket science, a few more words in the instruction manual would have been nice... I think the key is to add a little more potting soil that is not provided."
1,You can do much better,"I found this same item (although not blue, more festive, and no seeds) for less than $5 on sale. Although small for growing herbs, it is doable. Seeds are inexpensive, and the price here is no bargain, and more of a ....."
4,A very nice set,They are nice - actually a good size and I think come this spring they will be great in the window.
5,Great Investment Basics for Anyone Getting Started,"If you know anyone who is confused about all the complexities of today's investment markets, this book does an excellent job of simplifying the task of building wealth. The book is also ideal for anyone wishing to give their children a sound foundation for beginning to build a retirement program now."
1,Chicken Soup for Dummies,"Was there an editor's strike in New York and nobody told us? If you're one of those people who finds the ""Dummies"" series of books too complex and technical, then this is the tome for you! 160 pages of homespun homily about the authors, their family and friends, lots (WAY lots!) of success/failure stories. I was midway through this (thankfully) short book before the authors approached anything of substance as far as how to set out a savings plan. But then, there's nothing here you've not read before (save money, do it now, don't give up.) Venita VanCaspel did a much better job of making invesment planning more user-friendly than this facile, rambling collection of stories of the writers' buds. Instead of an investment guide, this reads more like a gift book from a shopping mall card store. What would have made this a GREAT book? As Sargeant Joe Friday was so fond of saying: ""Just the facts, ma'am."" But then it would have been a ""pamphlet"" rather than a ""book."""
5,Millionaire,The book is a quick read full of some of the most interesting and captivating ways to make money. I stongly recommend it.Manny Silverman
3,Not durable,"While this jumpdrive is very useful when it is functional there are a few fatal flaws. First, just dropping your keychain can cause the plastic to shatter, making it impossible to carry. Second, the plastic case splits off very easily. (I was inserting it into a usb port close to a parallel printer port and it came right off and fell on the floor) Once it comes off say good bye to your data and keychain. Mine is now defunct."
5,A must read book on the subject of women in leadership in the church,"Perhaps the best book on the subject of the role of women in the Kingdom of God that is out there. It is clearly written, inspirational and theologically accurate. This is a book that provides the groundwork for the changes that are occurring in the Western church as women take their God-ordained places alongside the men in advancing the Kingdom. I thoroughly recommend it."
2,"Some good points, but inadequate","I read through this book, and found some good points, but also some serious failures to treat the issues adequately -- probably because to do so would reveal the flaws in the authors' exegesis. While they reference the Kroegers and their ""women in Ephesus"" argument, as well as other egalitarians, they glaringly omit any reference to the book Women in the Church: A Fresh Analysis of 1 Timothy 2:9-15, by Andreas J. Kostenberger (Editor), Thomas R. Schreiner (Editor), H. Scott Baldwin (Editor), ISBN: 0801020204, perhaps the definitive critique of the egalitarian position. Until these authors reference and rebut what Kostenberger, et al, write and document, Why Not Women will not and should not merit more than 2 stars."
1,Godly Women do not aspire to have authority over a man,"""I suffer not a woman to teach nor usurp authority over a man"". It used to be simple but books like these wrestle Paul's words, exactly like Peter said they would, into a meaning that fits their theology.OK, can you name one female elder from the Book of Acts?Can you name a female apostle, overseer (bishop), elder, or pastor by name in the New Testament? There is ONE teacher of men mentioned, her name is in Revelation and it is ""Jezebel"".Women are wonderful helps, hostesses (deacons) tesimony givers, encouragers, servants to God's people. But God reserved leadership and headship to the man. ""The head of every man is Christ, the head of every woman is the man..."" 1Cor.11:1-4A man who makes his wife ""co-pastor"" should take down the signs in the church designating mens bathroom and womens bathroom.God did not see fit to put women in leadership over men. The apostate church does."
5,Incredible,"I have never read such a comprehensive study theologically, culturally, and biblically on this subject. Amazing truths that have never been brought to light even by college bible classes. Very beneficial, full of information, and absolutely brilliant writers."
3,where is the toe kick bracket,"this leveler should be sold as a two piece unit and not one as it is today, they at blum must know they aren't the best out there"
1,Absolutely horrible hard drive!,I had one of these drives in a brand new computer crash. I bought another one as an external hard drive. BOTH crashed in one week. BOTH were less than a year old. In BOTH cases WD found an excuse for not replacing the drives when clearly there was a problem. I gave WD a chance to make good and they blew me off. DO NOT throw away your money by buying a WD drive! They WILL NOT make good when the drive goes bad and CRASHES.
5,Pure joyful worship!,"This CD, partly in Hebrew and partly in English, is has filled me with joy every time I've played it. It begins and ends with the sounding of the ceremonial shofar. It includes the proclamation made by David Ben Gurion when the sovereign country of Israel was declared in 1948. The liner notes are great and include all of the lyrics in Hebrew and English. Highly recommended!Having said that, I must say that I ordered it on December 6, 2010 and received it on January 19, 2011. It was shipped from the UK--must have gone the long way around!"
3,great music,"The item was pictured as a CD. It was a tape that arrived. The price was too high for a tape. I was disappointed. The music is good and what I wanted, but I wanted a CD, not a tape."
5,UNBELIEVABLY ORIGINAL & POWERFUL WORSHIP CD!,"A) If you like praise & worship, you will love this CD!B) You will listen to it often, especially the first track.C) This CD is genuinely unique in sound and music style.D) I own this CD and absolutely love it!E) I can't recommend this CD enough!"
5,This CD has quickly become my favorite.,"The song 'Holy' brought tears to my eyes. Karen Davis' voice is so smooth, and the worship is sincere. You can feel the presence of God envelop you as you listen. This is just a must buy for believers everywhere. You will be blessed by this music. The songs focus on the Lord, and that is what it is all about, right? God bless you!""Ye'varechecha Adonai v'yishmerecha"""
5,Adonai,"I fell in love with Messianic Jewish music when I recently went to Camp Shoshanah to sit under the most brilliant Bible scholar, Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum's teaching. We studied the Word of God from a Jewish perspective, the only way to study the Bible. I digress....We worshipped the Lord by participating in Jewish dancing. I came back and immediately ordered the Adonai CD. It is FABULOUS, and I just LOVE it!!!!!"
5,sexy,"I almost did not get this but I'm so glad I did. It is so fun & it makes me feel good about myself,which I need after just having a baby. I own 35 bellydance dvds and this is one of my favorites."
4,The fine art of the flirt!,"Jayna brings something new that is often missing from most dance instruction videos -- the fine art of the flirt. This video is fun, sexy and even educational. All the basic bellydance moves are there but she shows how the whole sensibility changes with an innocent glance or an over-the-shoulder smile. This video is for those who want to bring a touch of playful sensuality to their dance at home or in front of a much larger audience..."
2,Cheap romance!,"When i watch a bellydance video for the first time, my husband looks at it with me, he likes to see what beautiful and sensual choregraphy i will learn. He was happy to see me learn from Veena and Neena videos. However, when he saw Jayna's video, he was laughing and laughing. He told me:- What is this video suppose to show you? How to act like a porno actress?So, i got rid of this video. If you want to be sensual and not look cheap, buy bellydance twins video, Veena and Neena. If you want to add an uptown girl look, a ballet video of Jennifer Nunes will do the trick."
1,Lasted 4 minutes with my cocker spaniel.,My cocker spaniel loves squeeky ball and I thought this would be perfect so I ordered 3. Ugh...lasted about 4 minutes with him. I'm hoping to return the other 2.Not good for dogs that are rough on their toys.
4,Impressed!,Ms.Sandhaus'voice has a relaxing easy going style that makes listening a pleasure. Would definately recommend to anyone who enjoys a true jazz musician not like the canned commercial sound of many others
4,Nice collection of quotes,"This is not a book to read cover to cover, but it does provide a good collection of quotes from various saints on various topics. The quotes provide some good short meditations. Some of them are profound. This is a good book to flip through, or to look up quotes on specific topics."
2,Weak collection,"As a fan of both quotation collections and words of wisdom from the saints, this book was a big disappointment. Most topics had only a few quotes (something like 3-5 on major topics) mainly from the ""big name"" saints like Therese or Augustine, and little effort appeared to have been spent in the making of the book. The type is large and the spacing big in order to make it look like a large collection. I paid $for it, and that seems a fair price, but I wouldn't go much higher."
1,Not very reliable,"When I first got this device I loved it. They are super handy to have around. However, there are some serious design flaws with the JumpDrive series. The little plastic cap that protects the USB connector loses it's grip on the base after a week or two. Then it is only a matter of time until you lose the cap. Several months after I lost the cap, the thing dies on me. It took all my data with it, fortunately it was backed up. Presumably it died because the connector got dirty in my pocket. They sent me a new one under warranty, but it has the same problems and I lost the cap in a week. Now, 2 months later, it is corrupting my data and I assume will be useless soon.If you treat the thing like jewelry and don't put it on your keychain, it may last just fine, but any regular use seems to kill them pretty easily. Find a more durable one like the Cruzer Titanium."
5,"Small, simple sweet!!","If you use two different PC's on a regular basis (I have a notebook at home) and a desktop at the office then this little cutie is indispensible!I can work on stuff at home and do my personal accounts in the office, lunchtime of course!Floppies, forget it, this is a new millenium! No more waiting for the disc to chug, chug around. And soooo much more reliable.Capacity is more than adequate, I've had mine 6 months used 10MB! Tip: you can compress and move to the little thing too - little more inconvenient but possible. If your a real horder then there is always 256MB/512MB and even 1GB!"
5,Loose cap,"After reading some of the reviews, it appears that the two major complaints are with obtaining the rebates and the loose cap. I can't help you with the rebates. (Personally, I always consider the price of a product to be the before-rebate cost when deciding whether or not to buy something and the rebate to be a plesent surprise if it comes.) However there is a solution to the loose cap issue.1. Cut 2 square pieces of scotch tape 1 cm x 1cm2. Roll 1 piece into a half-circle with the sticky side out and slide it into 1 side of the inside of the cap.3. Press it into the side with a key so that the tape is firmly sealed to the side.4. Repeat for the other side.This procedure makes the cap stay on more firmly and possible makes it more watertight."
4,Elegant computing solution,"The Lexar JumpDrive is an elegant solution to storage problems. I needed to archive my client database, and first tried Yahoo Briefcase, but it took literally hours to download the data, and updating the file required erasing the original before uploading the new version. The JumpDrive, however, does everything it says it will, and easily. No software, no drivers; just plug in and drag files to the disk image. Works quickly , and is good to look at as well. Users of Mac OS X: be aware that the JumpDrive comes formatted for Windows; if you're using Mac OS X, you may get ""-50"" errors when writing files to disk, unless you reformat the JumpDrive into the HFS+ format first, by using the Disk Utility program included with Mac OS X."
2,"256MB; work fantastic, then one day ....","Last night I used my JumpDrive to save my homework (about a hundred hour of programming work). I bragged about how well this JumpDrive worked to a friend and how easy it was to use compared to a zip drive. Then this morning, I booted up my computer to make sure everything was in order to print out at the school--it came up with an error message when I tried to open the drive. The error was that the drive was not formatted!Tried on several computers same error. I would have to say as well as it has worked for the month I have owned it does not make this worth it!"
1,write protect error,"I purchased the Lexar Media 256 jumpdrive. When I tried to use it I received a ""write protect"" error. After searching on the jump drive and every where on the internet to find out where the ""switch"" was, I found out that the jumpdrives delived in April had an error. I emailed the company, they wrote me back saying they would send me a return authorization, it has been almost a week now, no return authorization, and I still have yet to receive the initial rebate. I do not get a jump drive that works until I return mine. I have been disappointed with the delay. Friends of mine have jumpdrives by different manufacturers and have been very happy. Shop wisely."
1,Not as Good as Other Drives,"The price seemed right on this drive but performance is lacking. Like other thumb drives, it simply plugs into the back of your computer and becomes an instant hard drive.This drive, however is poorly designed. The cap fits in only one direction, the pocket clip (attached to the cap) pushes the cap off if used, there is no included extension cable, there is no point for attaching to a neck cord, key chain etc.I have also had trouble with performance. I can't seem to get more that about 95MB onto this thing without is complaining that the drive is full. This might be a bad chip but a manufacturer that lets an item out with more than a 25% shortage is probably not one you really want to deal with.Take my advice and look for other drives (my current preference is by GE)."
5,Great all purpose flash drive,"I've ordered two of these and found them very user friendly. I've had one for over two years. Although not the biggest as far as storage size, I have three copies of draft novels stored on one with lots of room to spare. Also this flash drive seems to work with older computers that don't have all the newer drivers. Very good value for the money."
5,Indestructible,"After being through the wash....twice, this USB drive has yet to falter. Data remains intact with no corrption, and is true plug and play with the newer windows os's. Just plug it in and transfer files the way you would with any floppy. If I had any gripe, it would be about the plastic ring used to attach to key chains and such, just a little to flimsy, but overall, an outstanding piece of equipment for the price."
2,"Good Product, No Rebate","I gave this product a review of two stars because the drive itself is good, but Lexar doesn't seem to honor rebates (it looks like other people had similar results). I like the functionality of the hardware itself: it's fairly fast, portable, and reliable. However, one of the main reasons I bought it was because of a $$$ rebate. Unfortunately, Lexar claims I mailed in the paperwork too late. I know this is untrue because I'm meticulous about rebates: I carefully read the fine print and make photocopies of all the materials in case a problem should arise. However, there's no way to prove when I mailed in the rebate, so I'm pretty much out of luck. To prospective buyers: I would not expect to get a rebate check in the mail."
1,Rebate Warning,"I read the rebate problems some have encountered here, but I still bought it. I recieved a denial from the company for not recieving the ""original UPC"". I had sent the ORIGINAL and I no longer have it to resend. How am I supposed to prove that I did? Even if I had a copy of it, it still wouldn't prove that I had sent the original. Go figure. My impression is that I'm dealing with crooks, who tease you with the rebate and find an execuse not to honor the rebate. I called them (after going through a maze of prompts on a long distance call) and they promised to take care of it in 6-140 weeks. I'm still waiting.My advice if you're buying it because of the incentive rebate, don't.As for the quality of the product, I can't comment since I bought as a gift for a relative overseas. Haven't heared from him yet."
1,dead jump drive,The drive worked fine until it started hanging up the computer and then it died. A friend of mine also had one and he too said his died. So be warned. Save everything regularly and don't put anything on that you don't have elsewhere.
5,Works Every Time,"I used this product while on travel. There were many different brands of machines being used in our meeting and we needed to transfer files between all machines. This jump drive worked in every brand and type of machine, even in Mac. Many of the other jump drives that were being used were not compatible with all machines being used. If you want a jump drive that will work every time between all different types of machines, this is the jump drive is for you."
1,NOT RELIABLE!,There support is terrible. You can't get a straight answer. This device will not back up and restore files on Quicken and other programs. It will lock up yoiur sytem when you restore! There support has no answers and won't send an rma to get replacement. It will drag and drop files but throws them all out of order. You can do the same thing with smart media cards and reader much cheaper and it is reliable!
3,Good but...,"Product works perfectly fine, but the cap to protect the USB plug keeps going off in my pocket... I'm gonna loose it very soon I guess."
2,Beware,"This thing worked great for about a month. I hardly used it at all. Suddenly and Unexpected it died, it doesn't do anything anymore. We think it may have come close to a strong magnet. In any case it is worthless now and I only used it about 5 times. These things are supposed to be durable but this was ridiculous."
1,not really great drive,"i had some problem configuring this unit in win 98se. thanks to the customor representative, i could finally make this unit work in win 98se after several hour hassle. the unit does not work w/ simple drive installation. i had to configure manually/ i could understand this problem because this is partly MS fault, but what makes me scary happened during data transfer. i tried to move several MP3 files from one computer to the another, but every files were messed up during the data transfer. after that accident, i have to check whenever i move the file using Lexar. oh yeah.. it is not durable either as many folks pointed out."
3,Too slow,"This thing works well for transferring documents, but has two major flaws:- Too slow. (Takes about 20 seconds to write one MP3 file.- Too wide. This cannot plug into the back of a desktop computer, if the serial port is in use, as it is so wide that there is not enough room. Also it cannot plug the whole way into my laptop because it is so wide that it touches the table when plugged in."
1,poorly built and fragi,"It is a toy made of cheap plastic and usb connector gets loose very easily and it stops working.It happened to me after one month use and I lost all my data on it.Do not buy it.If you want something like this ,buy one that is built sturdy like sony.you are not only wasting money but also risk llosing precious data."
3,Excellent when there is no problem,"There is no doubt about the advantage of using this jumpDrive (128MB). However, be very careful when you use it with an external usb hub or pcmcia usb, as I did. I did that once, and the jumpDrive died.May be it was a problem in my usb-pcmcia card. But, that killed my jumpDrive, anyhow. One second thing, It is not related to the hardware but to Lexar company. They never sent me the mail-in-rebate, after more than 6 months now."
3,no cap!,"This jump drive is great, keeps me from having to carry around (and risk damaging) my laptop between work/school/home in order to have the files I need. However, within the first week of having this product, the purple cap that protects it fell off. To buy new ones, you have to purchase a pack of 5 off of lexar's website, and it costs about $12 after shipping...for a silly little piece of plastic that was lost due to poor engineering."
3,Okay pocket drive.,"I agree with the reviewers who feel these Lexars are not made to withstand very rough treatment, but they're not all that flimsy either. I find them absolutely wonderful for transporting documents from home to work. We've also use them to copy albums of digital pictures and of course to share (fully licensed) MP3s.However, the 128 meg model is not USB 2.0 enabled, so the speed needed to make the latter two tasks really easy with this model is not available. I'd spring for the extra bucks required to get the speed and capacity offered in their 256 model."
5,I used it grab digital pics from my friends,"It was quick to use with Windows XP, nothing to download! Quick and easy. When I visited my friends a few weeks ago, I saved digital pics."
4,Great Product,"This is great, I hate floppy disks and this works great and pretty great size. Kinda a weird color and so doesn't exactly look 'professional' but decent price, although I found cheaper w/o MIR on lesser known brands. Then molding is [inferior] however and I am still trying to remedy that my keychain has broken off of from the thin plastic molding."
2,Not What I Hoped,"I had trouble with this drive. My son has a couple USB flash drives, and he just plugs them in and they work (PC and MAC!). An additional drive shows up on the computer, and you transfer files just like to or from a hard drive. But, my Lexar Media 128 MB JumpDrive didn't work that way. It would, in some cases, lock up my windows session requiring a reboot. This is with relatively new machines running Windows XP. Maybe I could format it or add software as others suggested, but why do so when other USB flash drives just work without all that. It got two stars because I was able to transfer data intermittently, and it was cheapest per MB that I found. Maybe with patience I could have figured it out. I did return it for a full refund."
1,REBATE PROBLEM - BUYERS BEWARE!,"...I too am being denied my...rebate because the company claims not to have received the original UPC code with my rebate submission. I did send this in (you can see that it was cut off the card) but I can't prove a negative. To make this worse, I had actually read and considered this reviewer's warning before purchasing the LexarMedia JumpDrive, so I was very careful to be sure I included the original UPC code. Is this happening to others, as well, I wonder? Otherwise, the product is wonderful and works totally as advertised but, for this reason alone, I could not recommend its purchase."
3,Practical and useful but poorly made,I bought this product about three months ago and it has worked well. My two complaints would be on how it is made. I attached it to my key-ring and the little plastic piece attaching the it to my keys broke. I have lost the cap as well. If you check the manufacturers website you will see they sell the caps in a group of five knowing many people will lose them. The plastic they use is not durable enough for someone keeping this in their pocket attached to keys with loose change smacking up against it. Perhaps if someone keeps it in a separate area such as a briefcase or bookbag it would last longer. I use mine all the time and like I said it works and for the price it is a good deal but you really need to take care of where you put it.
3,jump drive review,I appreciate the attractive apperance and price of this jump drive. I have had several occasions on where the jump drive does not make close enough contact with the port to registere. This can be a bit frustrating.
5,Nice Drive,"I have used this drive for about a year. It's great for transfering files from a Mac to a PC. You get 120MB of usable memory. It did just fail me, but I sent it in for repairs and got it back in 5 days. It will take longer to transfer and delete a whole bunch of small files (like jpegs) than large files. Overall, I have found this a very useful device."
4,Misleading Specifications,"The product claims it has a 128 mb of on-board storage. This is a crock. Lexar, you need to realize that a megabyte is 1,048,576 bytes, not 1,000,000 bytes. The real number of megabytes on this device is a 122 megabytes. The real number of bytes should be >= 134,217,728, not 128,000,000. I want my six extra megabytes and if they continue to lie to customers about the actual storage of their product, I will not buy another product from them.Besides that, it is a nice product. Very convenient to store data."
4,Great boat if you modify some things!,"If you want to sail in 5 mph+ winds then you must add lead tape to keel ballast and lead fishing sinkers to stern of boat. I bought lead tape from Golsmith and sinkers from Walmart. Take 6-7 inch strips and apply lengthwise to keel ballast (be generous and make the ballast look like a silver bullet). Add more tape if needed until you get the right weight for decent sailing and handling. Pour 2 small bags of small to medium size sinkers inside rudder steering compartment and add a generous amount of 5 min epoxy. Mix sinkers and epoxy then tilt boat backwards and allow mixture to set as far back as it can in the compartment. Try not to get epoxy on rudder shaft, I used a butter knife to arrange sinkers and glue. This keeps the bow of the boat from submarining in heavier wind. Its a cheap and fairly easy fix or you can buy a better boat. My Paradise sails almost as well as my 1 meter rc sailboat in winds up to 8-10 mph."
2,Not up to Spar,Product was shown with blue hull and sail design. The item shipped had a yellow sail and blue hull design which appears to be mismatched. Also it took 5 days longer than stated for shipping.Very light. Can't take much wind. Keel needs weight added to it or it will knock down easily. Just a simple toy.
1,UP UP AND AWAY,"When I first saw this rc model I was going to get it.The first of last month I put it on my wish list.At that time it was for sale from e hobby 169.00 and free shipping.Now it is over 200.00 and over 14.00 shipping. Whats realy going on that puts this model in the price range of 1 meter boats and smaller.Well kile I said at the top UP,UP,AND AWAY."
5,Great reading,All the stories listed in the previous review. Fictional not historical.It is an absolutely great read about Witches around the world and across the centuries. This book is a must for anyone with an interest in witches. Currently out of print but there is no book ever compiled quite like it.
5,Great for kids and parents too!,"You will love the great ideas and kid friendly activities. You'll find craft projects that are easy to make with things already in the house. It encourages kids to be imaginative. My three year old son watches it everyday, and love the songs and games. Each story instill in their viewers moral values that are appropriate. I think this is a great addition to your kids' video collection."
5,"One of The Best X-Mas Cd,s",Just a beautiful Cd for all folks in Christmas. You are going to enjoy the sound of this production and the voices of Los Hispanos. Believe me one of the best voices in all Llatin America and the caribbean.
3,Mediocre Lyrics,I really like Darlene( just saw her perform at a congregational meeting in LA last week) but this CD was not that good. Go with Hillsong instead.
5,What a blessing.,"I love, love, love this CD. It' awesome. The Music is amazing. Anytime i listen to this CD I just enter into the Presence of God. This CD deserves more than 5 stars. It expresses the exact way I feel about my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and I just feel like telling everyone. It's encouraging and my favorite songs are Dreams, Promise, Everlasting, Kiss of heaven, Heaven on earth, Pray, Everthing about you, faithful and thank You. All the songs are great and wonderful for mediating on Christ. Darlene has a gift to minister to others through worship and praise. I love Shout to Lord also and I knew that song before that's how I first found out about her. I will love to visit Hillsong Church in Australia to hear their worship team live. I recommend this CD to all people. What great LOVE.Just remember Jesus Loves You."
4,Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!: A Little Help from My Friends,"The Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!: A Little Help from My Friends DVD is very good. I bought this DVD for my 15 month old son after reading several other positive reviews on Amazon. My son loves the music and I like the stories and the fact you can change the language to either French or English for him. They are really good lessons for when he's older and can understand them. For now, he just loves watching the characters and listening to the music. I would definitely recommend this DVD to my friends."
5,kids movie,Good value for the price. Very entertaining for a young child. Good movie for young ones very catchy and appealing.
3,I wish he would have released this cd the first time,"I'm a big fan of Joe,the cd is very good,but he released this cd twice,with this one having four more songs,I would have given this cd 5 stars,but being that I bought this cd twice,I feel like I 've been ripped off"
3,What I expected.....,"It was about what I expected. The pilates workout was a bit of disappointment. The biggest complaint I have is trying to close the darn thing. The lock gets stuck and is nearly impossible to move. I added some WD40 on the advice of another reviewer and it did help, but didn't completely solve the problem. It's still a massive ordeal to try and close."
2,Broken Shower Hooks,Many of the hooks in the boxes were broken. Either the connector was broken or the whole end. I was able to mix and match and make do but I was disappointed with the product as delivered.
3,I have to get servos and radio transmeter and all that....,I have to get servos and radio transmeter and all that....I have to get servos and radio transmeter and all that....I have to get servos and radio transmeter and all that....
5,fun plane,"This is my first ""ducted fan"" airplane, I would suggest the ""brushless motor"" type for power, great fun and tricky to fly, a tad ""under powered"" in the brushed motor config.Nitro"
4,excellent summary of Napoleon's defeat at his own hands.,"Although I found the book insightful and rather stimulating, there was a large lack of precise detail regarding the mindset of the Emperor himself and just why he would attempt such a foolhardy invasion. Along with the maps and depictions, it was totally enjoyable, one of the few books I have not been able to put down."
4,Excellent gameplay,"This game has excellent gameplay, but the story leaves much to be desired for me- a bit far-fetched. Any way I don't play it much...was a gift for a friend."
4,Honest,"Well fist off the amount of time it took to ship was great, it took only 3 days for them to ship it to me on basic shipping rates set in Amazon!The one down side I did have was the disk quality. They did say it was in ""Good"" condition, I might suggest they place it at ""Acceptable"" instead because I did have to run it over a couple times with 'my' Disk Cleaner to remove some of the spots that were on the disk when it arrived. Also it looks like someone used a cheap motorized disk cleaner to try and do the job, but used a even cheaper cleaning product that clearly left the film still on the disk...Overall the game is great, action packed and if you know any of the storyline from the first game, then you will follow in line and love this one as well. good addition to the quickly dieing PS2 collection of games we hardcore gamers truely love! lol"
4,honestly it was a gift,"This was actually a gift for a friend of mine but he says that the games are awesome, so i will go with that."
3,Average,"I haven't played the first 2 installments, but I got this one for it rating and reviews.I'm a bit disappointed. I didn't buy DMC 1 & 2 because of reputed camera angle problems. The first two must have really sucked, as camera is one thing I hate the most about this game. The manual actually says ""There will be times in the game where you can't control the camera angle"". It should say ""Once in a while you'll be able to move the camera slightly to the side, not enough to make a difference.""Graphics are very good, so is the music. Some boss fights have an element of puzzle, which is good. But The whole camera thing ruins it for me almost completely. Definatelyb rent it first or get it when it's cheaper.This one's going up for auction."
3,"A Classic ""Rent Before You Buy""","First and foremost this game is extremely, extremely difficult. The single hardest game i have ever played. Now, im not one to complain about game difficulty, because often time an easy game you can beat in 3 hours is far worse than a very hard game. But, frankly, i don't know what capcom was thinking when they made this video game. Get to the end of a half hour board, fall victim to a nearly impossible boss, then start the board all over again. In my opinion its ludacris. As i said before, most action games are and should be challenging, but this game takes the expression to a level that i personally do not even want to be on. I will not spend Thirty minutes on a board, Die, then be forced to go through the entire board all over again. If You wanna spend an entire day or two on one board, go ahead and buy this game. I will be selling my copy of the game. The Graphics and gameplay are very good, but the structure of the game and the difficulty make this game terrible."
5,OWNED!!!!,"Ok I dont know about you but I live in West Virginia so the blockbuster has a poor selection. I finally broke down and bought DMC3 and it rocks. Flat out rocks. It will own you if you like games like God of War then you will love this. 6 Styles 8 weapons unlimited ways to destory demons. WARNING after an hour or so you may have to take a break because this game actually is a workout. Another thing, this game is hard like Ninja Guiden Hard. So when you beat a mission you feel like you have done something. The Music and Cutscenes are top notch too. Buy this or Die a loser."
1,Disappointing,"The Devil May Cry series is headed down hill. The original was a wonderful game, but I just plain couldn't handle Devil May Cry 3. The dialogue is absolutely horrible. Dante spouts the most lame phrases you've ever heard. Not much plot here, just lots of slashing. Although the slashing is more difficult, seeing as the American normal mode is equal to the Japanese hard mode. All in all, a pretty worthless game. Stick to your origins, because Capcom has tried to become too mainstream."
1,LOUSY!!!,This Game stinks. It is way to difficult. I don't like to pay $50 dollars so I can get fustrated and lose all the time. CAPCOM did NOT have the casual gamer in mind when they created this piece O crap. DO NOT BUY. RENT FIRST.
5,Another young guitarist that can sing too!,"go get it. I really like his voice. He plays a nice guitar too. I wouldn't call this blues.......per se' but, its blues based, and rocks for sure. which if you are like me, is just fine. I like him. also, try scott holt, sean costello, shawn pittman......and of course joe bonamassa, hello? rock on!"
2,what size,we just ordered this....the only thing is we don't know what size it will be coming in. How do we find this out?
2,Not as Good as I'd Hoped,"Having been a major Boingo fan for years, I found the ""Best o'Boingo"" to be a bit of a disappointment. They kept many of their better songs intact for this collection - ""Stay"", ""Not My Slave"", and ""Just Another Day"" are three of my faves. However, eight of the seventeen tracks are not the original Boingo classics, but re-recordings; and nowhere near as good as the original releases. (The re-recordings of ""Dead Man's Party"" and ""No One Lives Forever"", well, stink.) If you are a serious collector of Oingo Boingo music, this might be a good choice to round out your collection; but if you're buying your first Boingo CD, I'd suggest going with one of their older albums, such as ""Dead Man's Party""."
4,"Where's ""We Close Our Eyes"" ?","I live in Brazil, and in 1989 I heard Oingo for the first time here. Some songs from the album ""Stay"" (may be this one was exclusively to Brazil). Since then, I've been trying to find this album in CD, but is very hard to find some CDs in Brazil, as you may know. This ""best of"" is very good in my opinion, but there's only one fail: they forgot the song ""We Close Our Eyes"" that is the moust magical song that I heard from Oingo. If you have some hint, please send me e-mail to: pp1cz@bol.com.br"
4,Fabulous Boingo,"I only remember Danny Elfman's pathetic comeback attempt in the 90's as Boingo or whatever....However this CD puts him back on the map as a musical genius in my mind. I only recently started hearing some of his 85-91 material which is fabulous. This CD is a winner all the way. As a fan of big hooks, it's not perfect, but pretty damn close. I will be a fan of these guys for a long time. Dead Man's Party is one of the best of all time."
4,Music for the Darkened Masses.....that is Oingo Boingo,"This is how it is with me. I picked this CD up a long time ago. I was one of those who thought ""Hey, this has ""Weird Science"" on it"", and would play that track over and over. Then I picked up on ""Wild Sex"" and ""Dead Man's Party"". Later, ""Goodbye,Goodbye"" and ""No Spill Blood"" stuck in the folds of my brain. This was about the time when ""Boingo"" was released, and soon it was over. I picked up ""Farewell"" and realized what I missed. A band, that passes all other bands with their shear musicality. Yeah, Elfman is the genius behind it all, but without the others---they wouldn't be the spectacular live band that they were. I'm sad to think I missed it, but now I get to go back and live it through all their previous releases. Goodbye, Goodbye indeed."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,I ordered something on accident and tried to cancel it twice and it sent the email to the contacter. Then two days later it said that the item was sent. Do not buy first of all the stuff is a rip off DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER
1,What's this for?,"I thought I could use this in a real application, but there is more to it than just an adapter. I wish the seller would put what application this would work for. I was going to send it back... but got lazy."
5,Never Enough Patsy,"If you're a fan of Patsy Cline, you know that everything she recorded, from the most moving ballad to the rockingest honky-tonk, simply compels you to listen. Her powerful voice and her immaculate control command your attention from the git-go and never let up. If you're not yet a fan, I promise you will be.This set is perfect in every way, including all the important recording she made and a number of enjoyable sidelights -- radio transcripts, live recordings -- from the very beginning to the tragic end. The book gives an in-depth look at her life and times. Why begin with a ten-song ""greatest hits"" CD when you WILL want more?"
4,The Patsy Cline Collection,If you like Patsy Cline you will love this CD. The music will get to your heart.
4,Just a heads up,"This single is ""Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora ED Single - Madoromi no Rakuen""I'm sure Amazon would sell more of these if it labeled them in more detail..."
2,Not what I expected,This book was definitely not what I expected. She focuses alot more on yoga positions and color than anything else. I would not recommend this book to those who want to learn about chakras.
3,Nostalgia in tune!,"My selection of this DVD was a result of my affection for the songs of Stephen Foster. It is a ""curio"" in many respects, with some appearances by actors familiarin other roles - especially William Frawley who went on to star on TV in the USA -and Montgomery himself who starred in ""The Way To The Stars"", one of the moresuccessful fims about WW2 (and a favourite of my late sister who married a US officer and lived there for the rest of her life). But back to ""Harmony Lane"".It is entertaining enough in its way and manages to include some notable Fostersongs but isn't the proper ""bio"" that his short but influential life deserves.The print is passable for its age except for a few fleeting glitches in themotion during one or two scenes. If you have an interest in the man and his musicor the Hollywood of a past age, then this would appeal for its curiosity valuealone and I for one am grateful that it has been made available by its specialist publisher for the public to buy."
4,"Great product, but packaging is not a good choice for the environment.","I like this product very much. What I DON'T like about it is the packaging. It comes in six plastic containers, which is wasteful, IMO. They could throw in ONE reusable plastic container for the person who wants to use it to dispense the date sugar that way."
4,An excellent organic date sugar,"The sugar tastes as you would want it to -- not overwhelming, but clearly like a date would. And it can be used almost anywhere you could use sugar or honey (if either one would not be what you want, then this probably would not be a good choice either)."
4,Happy WIth Tree!,"We ordered this after the tree we'd bought DIDN""T come pre-lit. It arrived in one day--it was quite easy to put together but also, it is a lovely colour of green. Some artificial trees look greyish or brown. It is a truly brigt green and it is narrow as advertised. If it survives another few years, i'd say we'll be perfectly thrilled! Also, the lights don't get hot-- a plus if you have little ones."
3,Ease in set up,"Tree is average for the price. Very easy set up. No big ""holes"" or ""gaps"" in the tree. Good amount of lights. Don't especially care for the material the ""needles"" are made out of (I've seen some that look more real) but once decorated looks fine."
2,Not so good..,"The book is well written, well designed.. But if you are looking for some real results (and not just ""pretty theory""), I suggest you go elsewhere.. It will not give you the technical knowledge nor anything else you really need to achieve success on the internet (believe me, the ""talk is good"", but it doesn't fill your pockets :-). However, if you want to spend some money to read a ""funny"" literature, then I suggest you buy this book :-)"
5,EVERYONE should read this book!,"When I found out Robert Anton Wilson called this ""The Best Book of the New Millennium"" of course I had to check it out. I was not diappointed. Though I have no interest in marketing whatsoever, I found I could not put this book down. I think this book transcends marketing and addresses some serious issues common to us all. Anyone who wants to live a fuller life, protect themselves from ""manipulators"" (be they Big Brother, or your older brother), and actually achieve something in life should read this book. I found myself energized and enthralled by the end (I read it in one sitting). One of the most entertaining and enlightening reads of my life."
2,Not what I have expected :(,"The title is great, but most of the ideas in the book are just common sense. I'm disappointed by the hype this book is trying to generate.It's not a bad book. It's just not giving you enough information. Just like a short course on writing, you learn the principles but it will take a lot of efforts to work on it and to do it well.If you want a quick course on how to write effectively online, this is a good one. If you are looking for help on online marketing, then get other books."
5,"Finally, a book the blows the lid off HOW to internet market","As a physician, psychiatrist and internet marketing expert myself, I know the vital importance of persuasion in ANY marketing copy. People often need to be ethically convinced about why they really need your product or service. The internet has its own rules, the key one being it is in a constant state of flux and change. What NEVER changes is the need to master proven marketing concepts. The author is himself a well known and successful internet marketer. His book is well thought out, with copious examples and copy. He really shows you what works and why. I would highly recommend this book if you are serious about having an e-commerce presence.Stephen Gilman, M.D. of loudspectrum.com"
5,Mark has done it again!,Mark Joyner has done it again!!!He has given every marketer in the world the kind of book that we only dream about. This book gives great information that will work for any kind of Internet business. It worked wonders for mine.
2,There's hardly anything in it!,"Boy, talk about padding! Supposedly there are 150 pages in this book Only 70 pages have anything on them. The rest are either blank or contain very crudely drawn, adolescent style cartoons that look like they were written for morons. The writing style is equally high-pitched and [bad]. I just wanted to make sure others weren't duped into thinking this is a real book."
5,This book is truly a trove,"This book is truly a trove of valuable insightinto how one can incorporateidentifiable universal principles of motivationinto practical results.Definately NOT the same old stuff.If you are a couch potatoor have given up,you do not need this book."
1,....,"i didnt find this book very pleasing. i didnt really like it, it went on for ever. I think it was hype that made me buy this book. i regret it very much wasting my money i mean the goals arent even really. A complete waste of money & time reading this book. I mean its just hype making people buy it. Most of its useless. no explaining about how u can build or anything along those bases on how to build a better comunication & good starting business."
4,truth will out,"This book is an excellent and profound insight into genuine taoist health arts, particularly the Lee Style's fluid form of Chi Kung energy activation - K'ai Men (open door.) The lengthy introduction is one of the clearest and most inspiring accounts of taoism in relation to the arts that I have read."
1,chinese art of kai men,"I am sorry that I have to say this; Che Soo had very little knowledge of OUR chinese culture though he claimed he was taught by a chinese man called ---, all the materials in his book are, I suspect, made up by him or someone that they are very different from what I've learnt. Though I do not say that I know all but I have studied chinese literature and other chinese cultures for a very long time and I am still learning. Some of the stuffs really make me laugh."
4,few good ones on here,"my jams was nuff respect by buig daddy kane, nbn's up town anthemn love the james brown sample and that's about it the brand new heavieas joint was tight but that's it pooh man's smm is okay but not a bad sountrack herard better and worse."
2,pretty crappy,"only four good songs-uptown anthem by naughty by nature,juice by eric b. and rakim,it's goin down by epmd,and shoot em up by cypress hill. tupac should be on here since he was in the movie. he would make the album a lot better!"
4,okay tight but could have been better,"some good jams on here best ones to me are nuff respect by big daddy kane, and uptown anthemn by naughty by nature. aaron hall don't be afraid is on here and can't forget edric b and rakim's classic cut and epmd samples marvin gaye's i want you and the brand new heavies are funky as usual if you like that sound that is a good soundtrack."
3,From the back cover:,"It wasn't beginning to look a lot like Christmas. At least not for Ellie Lawrence and her family of two - soon to be three - kids. A fire destroyed their home in North Star, Michigan, along with mos tof their possessions. They'd ahve lost the family dog too, if Ben MacAllister hadn't come along in time.Ben's Christmas isn't looking a whole lot brighter. On leave of absense from the ohio State Highway patrol, he's being stalked by a teenager with vengence on his mind."
3,Hoping for more,"I was hoping for a little more technical stuff with this book. It talksabout old buildings, privies, new construction sites, and etc. to look forthings. I wanted techniques in the handling of the detector. Not so much aswhere to go. To me, it's a book about common sense. Overall, I wouldrecommend it. It is helpful in a few areas."
4,tips,"Even though the author is talking about hunting in New York, the tips and information about metal dectecting can be use anywhere. It has given me, a newbe, direction in how to find new places to hunt."
4,Good book. Better for older kids (over 10) and adults.,Gives a good idea of finding worthwhile relics in urban/suburban places. That is better than getting a metal detector to find quarters that people drop in the sand.
3,"OK, but lacks info.","Maybe OK for bare informaion, but could be more informative. Like it says, it is all Urban, and did not make any recommendations for what kind of finder to buy or what different options you might need."
5,Exceeded Expectations,Shipping time great as to be expected with Amazon. Book was good for a beginner metal detector user. Provided useful ideas on how to get started with this hobby and where to look. Worth the read and price.
3,Useful book for beginners,This is a great book for beginners or people who have not yet started in the marvelous hobby of treasure hunting. It really motivates you to just leave everything you are doing and heading out to your nearest park or historical site and start searching.The chapters on how to take care of your finds and places to find history reports on the place you are MD's are also a great idea.My only complain is the word URBAN in the title... I live in one of the biggest cities in the world but I like to go out of the city and search in old farms and arqueological sites. There is not much information on this subject. I just don't see why everything needs to be from NY's perspective in the book without any chapters to old country sites or even other countries (ancient Europe anyone?).Overall if you are starting or about to get starting in treasure hunting this is a great book to begin your new hobby.
4,Dorman makes good parts,"First of all, it is a good fit and a quality made part. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I do agree it should come with all the bolts if the instructions state to replace them all. If this was your only vehicle, you would be stranded with the manifold already off the car. Mine were in good shape, so I reused them. Also, make sure you check the gasket is on correctly. At first glance, the gasket looks the same on both sides, but if you have it backwards, the holes for the bolts will not line up and you could damage the gasket. I thought that was important to mention. Its been on my car several months now and is working great! The only hard part is hooking up the flex pipe back onto the manifold. I did not find any special tools were needed."
2,May need extra Bolts,"Part fits on my 1997 Toyota Corolla just fine, price is great; however if your not a mechanic, be prepared to spend 4 hours under your car with a long cheater bar.Product description says, ""Includes commonly needed parts to complete the installation."" It only comes with 2 new bolts. This leaves you either reusing or buying the other 5. Reusing them isn't the end of the world, but the instruction sheet included with the part says to replace all the bolts. (by the time you get the rusty nuts off, you may need to replace them)The deception in the description give it 2 stars. If it had more bolts or warned you that you'd need them I'd give it 5 stars."
4,A must have product at low price!,A very good product. For traveling people with GPRS Internet access. The charger is good when you are away of power.The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing (for professional and expert users only).
1,Never works,"I receive this cable with a cd broken.After install the driver, I plug the cable following the instructions but never works.Very bad product."
1,cords not up to standards,Every cord has broken right at the connection point. Very poor quality cords. I would not buy these again.
5,Practical Icelandic,"I'm quite pleased with this approach to learning a language, after earlier experiences with traditional textbooks. It's clear and the order is very practical--what's your name, where are you from, what are you doing, where are you going, what time is it, it's time for a review, etc. I visited the official website of Iceland recently, and was somewhat dismayed to learn that 99% of the population speaks English, but there are still the sagas."
4,An excellent resource!,"This is an excellent resource for those who want to learn the language of the Icelanders. I am very impressed at the tight relationship between the book and the CD's. Lessons on the CD follow exactly those in the book.After only using this course for a month, I already have a greater understanding of the cases of words (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) than I ever had in 3 years of studying German. The course materials naturally flow from basic conversation (What is your name? My name is....) into more and more complex sentences, and explain in-depth the case changes as they become relevant.If I had one recommendation for this course, I would suggest more time within the CD lessons to repeat what has been said in Icelandic. There is very little space given to practice saying the words on your own, and you may find you need to manually pause the CD in order to say the words. Since the CD lessons are conversational, this can become frustrating over time."
2,Recommended only for weekend travellers...,"My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic. For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary... Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good..."
4,Teach Yourself Icelandic,"This is a good course for the more technically minded student. It starts simply and gives more in depth information with each chapter.It focuses a lot on the grammar, cases and declension of Icelandic and is perhaps more suited to someone who has already studied a language besides english (I am a German speaker).It gives a good understanding of how Icelandic works as a language and the CDs help a lot with pronounciation and understanding the spoken language."
4,arty but hot,"first off, as a totally hetero man, i only enjoyed 75% of this movie. everything involving the one guy trying to seduce the other guy i jumped thru. not that there is anything wrong with that. however, everything with the older wife trying to seduce the younger wife is hot hot and HOT, with great sexual tension. plus the scene with her and the telephone repairman is quite good also."
3,heavily cut,"It shouldn't be bought, not because is bad but because is heavily censored - some 30 min missing - and because those people they beleive they have the right to treat the customer like an ignorant and immature child should take a message. It is offending to our intelingence and dignity to be supervised by an invisible censor who desides before us , for us what is good to see and what is not. Myself i don't accept to be treated like that and i encourage everybody to avoid buying censored products as offencive to our intelingence and that of the creator artist. Is a phaenomenon that should be eliminated and it will be if our behaviour as customers is sensitive. Apart from that is of a little importance if the film is good or not. Yes it is ! so what?"
2,Very disappointing,"I was really looking forward to a nice small set and with the name of Chicago Cutlery, I thought they would be of better quality. The handles are cheaply made and the blades have already spotted after the first use. I will not buy any Chicago Cutlery again."
3,"Very sturdy, too thick, not so sharp","For the current price (four bucks) these are a good deal. Just don't expect them to be very sharp. The blades are unusually large and unusually thick. This makes them strong, but not sharp."
5,Great knives at a Great price,"This set of four knives is the same great quality of more expensive knives and they are a fraction of the cost. The knife blades are Chicago Cutlery quality at the best price I've ever paid for a knife (much less a set of four) ever in my life. The sturdy colored handles make it easy to identify each knife blade, they contour fit the hand well and you can leave in water without the worry of warping. With four knife blades to choose from there is a knife for almost anything you need to do in the kitchen."
3,OK KNIVES,THESE KNIVES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT. THEY WERE JUST OK. I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO BE BETTER QUALITY.I SELDOM CHOOSE TO USE THEM. THE BEST THING IS THAT THEY ARE COLORFUL.
2,Chicago Cutlery 4-Piece Paring Colored Handle Knife Set,"Hi, I was kind of disappointed with these knifes. They are much largerthen I expected. They seem to be sharp enough. Guess I can't be fussybecause they were so cheap. Would I reccomend these? No.Sandy Chausee, S. Yarmouth, Ma. 02664"
2,not recommended,"I ordered these and they rusted out couple of uses. Called the company and they said that I wasn't drying them properly and they would send a cleaner that would take the rust away. Well, I was drying them throughly. After several calls to the company; that NO cleaner had arrived. Months later, they sent me a new set of same knives. They set unopened. The are heavy for arthritis people; and handle is made larger for a man. Not comfortable in the hand; even though they are grooved for fingers."
1,Disappointing,"I got these knives after reading some nice reviews. I wasn't looking for anything fancy, but I was looking for something sharper than the 12 yr old knives in my kitchen that never get sharpened. These knives are so thick, it's like using a butter knife! Who cares what the price is if it doesn't work."
5,knife set,"Really like these knifes. great colors. very usefull use for cheese, fruit and vegetables."
2,Not great...,"The sandwich spreader (green knife) is fine; the yellow knife is useless -- it cannot cut straight; the red and blue are just ok. Four knives for four dollars is ok, though, if you need some ""disposable"" knives."
5,Best value for photo paper,This paper would compare to the Kodak Anytime Picture paper. It dries very fast and the images are crisp. The paper has a semi gloss finish and is a medium weight. This works well for printing images when you need to fold the paper. It is a good value. I bought a 30 sheet pack for the same price as a 20 sheet pack of the Kodak paper of the same quality.
4,Needs a better product description,Would have preferred to not have the dividers in the bag. One large compartment would be better. This should have been described better in the product description.
5,Works Great,Damper is a direct replacement for stock and adds a firmer feel to the steering for my truck. Easy installation.
2,"'Doesn't quite ""catch fire"" as the title suggests","Patti's 1991 album is more like an ember than it is a full blazing inferno. Luther Vandross, Gladys Knight, Sarah Dash, Nona Hendrix, and Michael Bolton might be on hand, but even their support can't help an otherwise mundane recording. Too many of the songs sound like other things that Patti has done. Even ""Release Yourself"" sounds like a rip-off of Aretha's ""Rock Steady"" without any of that song's saving graces.Only the opening track ""Feels Like Another One"" has any ""oomph"".I wish that she had had another one on this album."
5,Convincing with laughter,"Dr. Ray is witty, whimsical, and immensely convincing as he details his journey back to the Catholic faith. As he shares the times he came to face himself and laughs at his own foibles and misunderstandings, he leads us to examine our own misconceptions about the church. In the end we have to agree with Dr. Ray, there is only one reason to be Catholic; because its true! The humor will have you crying from laughter yet getting the very serious message that what we believe makes a difference in where we place our hope.In like manner, the discussion for fathers is enlightening, humorous, and practical for all Christian parents.There will be much to think about and share often from what you see and hear in these two great programs. Well worth the investment for a video you will want to watch and share again and again."
4,what a rainy day in heaven would be like&#65533;,"before i get harped on, lemme say rainy days kick azz. this album is like a little downtime preview of Praga showing what his off season is like. with 2 bangin' new trax (breathing new life N2 JeanGenie & Lust4Life) that are str8 from heaven and a compile of mixes from other rare singles, this is a gift for the US public and a good album for on the way to the club, sippin coffee or just havin a nice drive on a rainy day. if you wanna hear some different PK, this is one way he serves everyone, by giving u a taste of some of the harder2find mixes of his mixterpiecez. if u liked this u'll like the luvUstill single!"
3,Good,I got this for my daugther-in-law and she really liked it. She wears it everyday. Not bad for the price.
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"I've only read 30 pages of this book but doubt I will bother to finish it. It's quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. It's riddled with spelling and grammatical errors (was there no editor on this manuscript??), the writing style is wooden and amateurish, the stories range from utterly incoherent to beyond far-fetched, and the protagonist inspires not a drop of interest or empathy. Save your money. Better yet, spend your money on Diablo Cody's ""Candy Girl"". Now *that* is a great book."
4,"Depressing, cynical, but very interesting...","I have read all the reviews written on this book..I am alwaysattracted to books that people give both negative and positive reviews about...those are usually the best books because the author has managed to spark some type of emotion from its reader, whether it be good or bad...I rate this book a four because I felt that it was very interesting especially to somone like me who has never been exposed to this type of life style. The author comes off as being intelligent and well versed on the subject. I too am a big fan of Janis Joplin, and that is the person that she dedicated the book to...on the other hand..I think thatthe authors viewpoint of life was very jaded and maybe rightfully so..who am I to judje..but that depressed me..this wasnot an uplifting story.."
3,decent inexpensive guitar,"Good for someone that just wants to mess around with a guitar but may not be the best choice for someone that is serious about learning how to play. I purchased it for my husband for Christmas to learn on but he is already looking to replace it with a ""real guitar"" after his 2nd lesson because it will not hold tuning. He is getting frustrated with having to tune it every time he picks it up."
4,Okay,Im just a beginner but it was so hard to use this thing it was so much more fragile then other guitars my family owns i was afraid to break it overall it s ok looking but the sound isnt the greatest
1,it was not very good,"it was suppose to be a new one , it was a used one.the strings were wrong ones .it was chipped and cracked."
1,Junk - Absolute Junk!,"First off, I ordered a black guitar and got a blue and black guitar. Not a huge deal, but still it was supposed to be black. Second, this thing looks used, very poorly made and honestly looks like it was super glued or something. Third it has been restrung, it now has metal strings on it and those were junk. Overall I feel like I overpaid (app $30) and this was a guitar for a four year old!I was really unimpressed by this one, I would run!BTW I have never posted a review before and have made over 100 purchases on Amazon. Yes, this one was THAT bad!"
2,Mismatched talents,"George Davidson has a tremendous talent and ability to create wonderfully soothing music - but his talent is lost with the vocalists who accompany him. I find their singing course, flat notes abound and the soothing effect of his music virtually absent.I'm sadly disappointed by this CD but look forward to his next work."
1,Misleading Description,"After reading all of the opinions concerning this book, I thought I was receiving a collector's item for which I could store my state quarters. However, I was extremely shocked and disappointed when I received this book and found no coin holders. My main reason for purchasing the book was for the coin holders. I would have thought there was a mistake in shipping had I not received 2 from 2 different companies with the same missing item."
1,only in the name of love,"only one song that rocks-R.Kelly step in the name of loveKim waters is a master of R&B; remixes and has made betteralbums.I,am sorry I can,t give a Maryland Homeboy a greatreview."
5,High Over Paradise,"This is an amazing collection of arial photos by one of the best. Robert Carerons work is the benchmark of this genre, he is the master and this book really demonstrates this in full. Let's face it it's not hard to make Hawaii look good in photographs, but what makes Cameron so great is that he can make something that has been photographed so many times look like something totally new, that is the mark a great photographer. I am a huge fan of his work and this book is an exemplary example; he does Hawaii a great service. I highly recommend this to anyone with an appreication of photography, this man was special."
4,First-rate,"Thank God for book versions of movies. So many integral things were missing from the film; it was good to have a book to turn to fill the gaps. Overall, the book and film match. Don't get me wrong. But certain scenes that were apparently left out of the movie, but included in the book, lend crediblility to the plot. This is well worth your time."
5,The End?,"I managed to pick up this CD before leaving on a road trip. I found the story fresh, entertaining and a great addition to the Star Trek Universe.Boyd Gaines reads the book, and he is outstanding. This guy has starred in some minor parts though out his carreer, but after listening to this CD, I am surprised that he hasn't landed a lot more roles.I suspect that this will not be the last voyage of the Next Generation crew."
2,Wacky but not that funny,"I liked that his comedy was very wacky, animated, and clean, but it was ""smile with an occasional laugh"" funny. I only laughed a handful of times, and those laughs didn't last long. For me, 2 stars. For young kids it might be a 4 or even 5 star. My personal favorite is Brad Stine's ""Put A Helmet On!"" He is animated as well, but also intelligent, relevant, and fall out HILARIOUS."
3,Different than image,The actual product is not colored like in image. Feels as if it was not finished. However the details are great but i wonder why this manufacture always provide false product images (not my first time)
5,Great Variety,"I love the variety of bag styles and sizes available. Detailed, easy to understand instructions with lots of pictures. Can't wait to get started."
1,Case is cracked...hope the CD isn't...,Case is cracked...hope the CD isn't since this is a gift for a family member. We'll find out on Christmas...
3,Satisfied,"Having been the recipient of a suggestion to look into this musician's well-reputed rendition of the Leonard Cohen masterpiece - ""Hallelujah"" - I bought this CD in the hope that I would like at least some of the other tracks on this collection. Alas, I did not. However, Jeff Buckley's performance of ""Hallelujah"" is magnificent and worth every penny of the price I paid for this entire CD. That one song receives five stars from me while the rest of the CD gets only three."
4,Good music,"I originally bought this CD for the song Hallelujah, that was on the final episode of ER. I found that so many of the other tracks were easy to listen to and I enjoyed the entire CD. Funny that I never heard of this singer/song writter before."
2,new to jeff buckley,"I bought the album for the song hallelujah since I heard it on Sopranos and I didn't know who sang it but it stayed in my mind. When I heard Xfactor winner had recorded it I thought another great song ruined as I'm not into the over dramatic singers they churn out every season. I can't bothered to watch plastic pop. I have listened to the cd a few times but I find it a bit gloomy, although he has a good voice and the music is great I'm taking my time to warm to it. But I love music and wont dismiss it. I love to listen to talented people and he was very talented, my advice, never listen to it if you are dpressed cos he won't cheer you up!"
5,Lightnin the blues,A must have blues album.The delta blues sound like an old man tired to explain you the meaning of life.He is calm and you feel you've must hear it. A great one.Is for professionals.
2,Accel 7047 8.8 300+ race wire set.,"I purchased this wire set for my son's 1976 Chrysler Cordoba. The wires that fit seem to be top quality wires. The reason I'm giving the wire set the 2 star rating is only 5 of the wires were long enough to fit. 3 were to short to even fit the closest plug. When you pay this much for a wire set that is rated to be an OEM like fit, you expect OEM like fitment. The car does run a lot better with the 5 new wires. I used 3 of the best old wires. If all the wires had fit I would have given them a 5 star rating."
3,"Fun, sort of, Cool, in a way...","This is a great book if you have a teacher to help you understand it. The first time I read it I was about to fall asleep. Then when my teacher helped explain it to me, and I read it again, it wasn't so bad. After about the 4th time reading it, I actaully enjoyed it, if you believe it. If you attempt to read it, don't get too depressed after the first time reading it, have someone explain it to you, then read it again, is my advice."
1,Fact? Or Editorials?,"This book seems to be miscategorized. While well written technically, it lacks properly attribution for many assertions, and seems to be more of a series of editorials than actual researched subjects.If the author decides to revise the book in the future, he should consider providing much more source background, and leave the conclusions up to the reader, rather than making those conclusions without first providing the facts to back them up."
2,No depth,"I picked this up because I needed a little non-fiction fix. Liking Zinn's ""A People's History"", I thought I might glean something from this book. However, aside from a couple of factual errors and a lack of citation, I did keep on reading. I did so because the writing is clear and engaging.Yet there is something lacking, and it is breadth to the subjects covered. This breezy read could be helpful to someone whose only experience with studying history is a middle-school class. Anyone else might just wonder why something like the Spanish Flu epidemic gets relegated to one paragraph.I would recommend looking for another resource"
2,Remarkably superficial,"Aside from the semantic problem that the previous reviewer noted, i.e., 'secrets' tend to be things that are kept from public knowledge, this book is simplistic and superficial to the extreme. The tone is one of middlebrow haughtiness (think Reader's Digest) and the information tends to be more of a gloss instead of the interesting anecdotes one would expect from the title.This book seems to have been written to reassure the author's chosen audience that they already know everything important."
1,This Book Should Stay A Dirty Little Secret,"James Dunnigan's ""Historical"" novel drew me in because of the title. I assumed that I would be presented with historical facts that had been covered up or whitewashed by the powers that be. Instead I found the novel to be more of series of editorials in with very little legitimate historical fact. Mr. Donnegan presents sweeping generalizations, statistics and charts that are not validated, and conclusions that are drawn, not on the facts presented, but on personal bias. There is no bibliography that one can check or investigate his information. He often uses language that is insulting and leading. I found his book to be an insult to the intelligence of anyone who believes themselves to be a historian. The book stated that it ""provides a unique look at the past one hundred years"" and I agree with this statement. Dunnigan's ""historical"" look is unique in that it is far from a true historical work, and should not be placed under the category of history."
2,Disappointing,"I found both of the Companions difficult to use in relation to the novels. They would have been much more helpful if Ms. Morrison would have begun with either the Lymond or Niccolo Series and followed it through with references page by page from, for example, The Game of Kings, then from Queen's Play, etc. then doing the same with the other series rather than placing all references from all books of both series at the same time in alphabetical order. Also, sometimes I would search for terms or quotes that I felt should be included based on those already in the Companions but didn't find them so do not know what the criteria was for including some and not others."
2,Could be improved,"This book -- a great idea -- could have been made 6 times more useful by a simple editing decision. Since most of us read just one Lymond novel at a time, why not present the items alphabetized, BUT IN BOOK ORDER? Thus, if you are reading Game of Kings, you will not have to stumble over pages with irrelevant entries from the Niccolo series of novels.And -- since there are not so many entries per book as to overwhelm -- an interested reader could just read all the entries pertaining to one novel, and then proceed with that novel."
2,Publisher's review misleading,The publisher's review of this volume indicated it was released after the final 8th volume of the House of Niccolo series so I think I can legitimately express surprise when I discovered that it only covered the first five of these books? Very disappointing.The second Dunnett companion volume apparently completes and expands the coverage but the current price for the paperback of this book exceeds the price I paid for the whole series in this binding! Whats up with this?
3,A handy reference book for Nicolo and Lymond,I didn't get this until I was into the 5th book of the Nicolo series. I whish I had gotten it sooner. I was able to find the info I needed on line but this book was easier and had pertinent information pertains to the story.
5,Love That Pokemon Music!,"I am the most devoted Pokemon fan in the world in this day and time. I think about Pokemon every second of every minute. And music like this, it is just awesome! Pokefan children, even your parents will love the Pokemon Medley (#10), which features famillar tunes with new words. My favorite of thoses is ""Here We Go A Batting"". You'll love this CD, I promise!"
4,The CD was Good But A Little Nasty,"The CD was good but a little nasty. The nasty track was track 7(the previous one I wrote was wrong) It's nasty because the lyrics Ash & Misty sang were MUSHY! If Ash & Misty saw eachother under the mistletoe the they have to SMOOCH! (KISS) Ash & Misty are too young to have a serious relationship. they are not a good couple anyway, because Misty is 12 and Ash is 10. And the other reason is um...um... they don't look alike. Well maybe I'm just jealous. Ash is kinda cute. I hate to say this, but Misty is kinda pretty..............................."
2,Make it stop!,"How can this cd possibly get so many good reviews? How? It hurts your ears and possibly could give you serious brain damage if you listen to it for too long, ie, 5 or 6 minutes. If you like anime music, get the Laputa/Castle in the Sky soundtrack or anything! Laputa is a work of art and is so soothing. The score is breath- taking. After you think about it, ""Pokemon Christmas carols"" is pretty funny. lol. Laputa is really worth the money, and you can get it new from a third-party seller for 15$. Pretty good deal.pokemon christmas carols lol"
1,Uninspired Pokemon Recording,"I may be 21, but I'm really into Pokemon and the music of Pokemon. However, I'm not into this album. I'd like to give kudos to the creators for letting the main characters from the series sing, this has long been the standard for Japanese recordings. However, the difference between their singing and ours is, that our characters can't sing, and usually speak instead of singing on this album. This is annoying. Also, the re-written words to the Christmas favorites and the totally new songs just aren't up to par. I'm surprised that Nintendo's Quality Control Department let this album slip by. My recommendation to you is to skip this one and wait for something a bit more inspired and creative to come along. Oh, and P.S., next time they release a short album, please include a video or something."
1,aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!,oh my god!!! how could anybody like this?????? the world is coming to an end!!!pokemon singing? aaahhhhh!!!this is crazy!!! anybody who actually likes this is insane!!! aaahhhh!!!!i swear everybody who actually likes this is on drugs!!! aaaahhhhhh!!!but seriousely this world is coming to an end and this is proof
3,fair,"This mid 90's release by the UK based trio was fairly disappointing to me. The harmonies that propelled the trio to greatness on lps like ""Insight"" were somewhat lacking in intensity on this album, and I found the music to be somewhat lightweight, as well.Fans of the Blackstones will appreciate the efforts put forth here, but I do not recommend this album to non fans.. try to find their ""insight"" lp to see this trio at their best."
1,"Difficult, and boring to read","First off, the author needs help with the queen's english, especially grammer. He uses such phrases as: ..during his reigned... ...to solved the many problems.. ..a land that was laid wasted, and many more.He cited ""Bigfoot"" as being a ""Man-Ape"". We know that the Bigfoot story was a hoax. He gives the date of the great flood as 30,400 BC, while most geologists and ancient history scholars date the great flood about 13,000 years ago. Based on his treatment of Gilgamesh, I don't believe that he understood what he read. I don't recall that Gilgamesh went to the Cedars of Lebanon to harvest timber.I'm sorry that I wasted my money and time on the book."
2,"Decent book, but many better options","I bought this book when I was first starting at a local homebrew store since they had a limited recipe book selection. I was very let down with the contents. Most of them are mashed, which isn't a bad thing, but I am still at extracts. also very few of the recipes seemed to jump out at me as ones I had to try. They have all been tested at competitions though, so I am sure they are good, and the book includes brewers comments on beer (ie. proceedure, and other details) and judges comments (ie. flavor of hops didn't come though, poor head retention, etc.) So adjustments can be made. If you are looking for additional mash recipe's this book may be of help, but I feel there are many more to fill it's spot on your shelf more effectively."
2,Couldn't get it to work right.,"This might be a good product, but the one I had didn't work, so I had to return it."
3,Friends From Rio - Misturada 1,"Far Out Recordings' Friends from Rio project get put through the wringer with _Misturada 1_, with the typical mixed results from any remix album. Pressure Drop, for instance, make ""Fransisco Cat"" into a dreamy downtempo concoction, while Wax Doctor brings his atmospheric breaks to ""Maracatudo."" For those who like a little bit of electro, A Forest Mighty Black brings some a taste of it (with a big bite of whistles) into the uptempo ""Batacuda."" I'm somewhat surprised at the Da Lata version of ""Para Lennon E McCartney""; they're quite well-versed in this style of music, but their mix has a slightly grindy quality that's off-putting. Noukazu Takemura gets two shots at mixes: ""Os Grilos"" takes the Brazillian peppiness of the original and adds some easy listening elements (as well as a baby's exclamation of surprise); ""Bebe"" is much more abstract, from the flute intro to the shuffle-and-skitter beat and hacked-apart melody. An interesting collection, to be sure."
5,NICE SET,I LOVE THE WIZARD OF OZ. AND I AM VEYY HAPPY TO SEE THIS SET BEING RELEASED. I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT TOYS R US IS ALSO SELLING THIS SET [...]. THAT'S A QUITE A DIFFERENCE IN PRICE ESPECIALLY IF YOU PLAN ON BUYING THE WHOLE SET. OF COURSE TOYS R US DOES NOT SHIP FOR FREE LIKE AMAZON DOES SO I RECCOMEND BUYING THIS SET IN-STORE IF YOU DO GO THROUGH THEM. 5 STARS FOR THIS WONDERFUL SET!
2,First movie is the only one worth watching,"The first movie is great and a sensible zombie/sci-fi movie. With each new film they produce progressively is more ridiculous, has worse acting and plot. The culmination of this is seen in the last movie in this series. Other than the production quality the script and acting looks as if it is a sub par made-for-syfy movie.The last two movies are basically two parts to an incredibly long and bad movie.I gave it two stars because the first movie is great, the bluray discs work and the packaging doesn't fall apart."
3,Confused,"Im confused, where it says Regions it says all regions. Now when it comes to this stuff im not educated will this play in my blu ray player which is format for Region 1 or A?"
3,Acceptable,This collection is made &#8203;&#8203;in Europe.One of the films has not translated into Spanish and those that have are in Spanish from Spain
4,Christmas present,"I have not seen any of the Resident Evil movies, this was a present for my daughter (40) and she says they are great so If she is happy I guess I am too."
1,Need more product info...,"How is it that people are able to rate this item when it is not even out yet? Anyways, I've been holding out and waiting for a 'put together' set like this to come out, but now I'm a little concerned about getting it because of the listed aspect ratio - are all the films reformatted to 1.85:1? I'm just one of those that prefer 2.35:1/widescreen... :-( (disregard the one star)"
2,Why Bother????,You know everytime that there is a new Resident Evil Movie they will make a set so why not wait until they are done making the movies? they are thinking about 1 or 2 more but I am buying the blurays as they come out so I wont buy the FINAL boxed set but for those who are just buying this one? Why not wait? but thats me
4,Good price quality item,This is the only accessory kit that I could find at a reasonable price that was from Sony. Good value
2,OK I guess...,"Not a great carry bag, but the value of the battery makes it a good deal.The holster case i bought is the one I use to carry may camera and i just use this one for storage."
1,too small,"This is simply not practical! a wast of money. It could only fit the camera and you cannot even think of fitting in the cords and so forth. It is so frustrating that I had to buy a new one. And buyers, beware of the battery. It was completely useless to my camera model! I regret every bit of the product."
1,Slow Pot Of Coffee,This product brewed VERY slow. Put a lot of drain on the battery. Look elsewhere for a better product. I returned it.
1,You have to cut the edge by yourself !!,It's just a sticky transparent paper. You have to cut the edge by yourself...which there is no round edge as what shown on the box.
1,Skip this.......,"Poorly sourced, this focuses on one line of Putnams, rather than the whole family, despite the implication of the title. Better material on this family is available in other genealogies (and even on-line for free!). If a rating below 1 star were available, I'd use it.An excellent example of vanity publishing.The first few lines (10,000 years ago and the glacier over Britain through to the Putnam line the author is descended from) are wonderfully funny, if you haven't spent money on the book."
4,good Alex Cross novel,Enjoyed this Alex Cross novel. I'm trying to read them all in order! So I'm a bit behind but catching up.
5,Kristmas Time is Here,"This album certainly made my yuletide bright. This is a collection of 15 Xmas tracks by the band best known as the core of Lower Manhattan's legendary Losers Lounge (an approximately monthly series of tribute concerts.) In addition to being a great holiday album, this is an amusing homage to 1970s instrumental rock. The band affectionately and accurately parodies everyone from King Crimson to the pre-Stevie Nicks version of Fleetwood Mac to the Allman Brothers to the Raybeats. My second-favorite track is a cover of ""Welcome Christmas"" from ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" done the way Focus would have done it. My first-favorite is Joe McGinty's original tune ""Snow Globe Sympheonette"" which is pure Kustard Kings.This is a Christmas album you could stand listening to the other 11 months of the year, so go ahead and order it even if it won't arrive before December 24!"
2,Not As Absorbent As Regular Super Plus...,"The regular super absorbent ones I get for my mom weren't available, so rather than get the ones with the side tabs which I find scratchy, I tried these. I called the company and was told they were just as absorbent as the super plus ones. I don't find that to be true. On the two mornings I've tried them, my mom had wet a great deal right through to her pants on both days. That happened only occasionally with the others. The gathered tops are also a bit more scratchy than the on the regular super plus.If you need light control these might work for you, but it didn't work for us, while the others were very good. BTW, the regular super absorbency Prevail are much nicer than the Depends she wore before which would stretch out on top, and droop from the weight when they became saturated. These keep their snug fir on top, and are softer, and nicer next to the skin."
3,Mighty Crown is Mighty short,"While I have grooved to this CD, I always feel a little short changed for the price. The content is fresh and offers that feeling of being inna de dance pre-electronic dancehall era. The songs are of top quality, Johnny Osboure, Linval Thompson, John Holt,Yellow and many others jamming off the production of the late Henry Junjo Lawes. Mixed with often bland sound effects of the dance, the tunes are indeed crucial, and does give tribute to the man who garnered great music in his day. Junjo Lawes was responsible for taking roots reggae into the eighties era and keeping its vintage classic sound while meshing it with contemporary new riddims. He was shot and killed in 1999 and what a talent the world has loss. Mighty Crown the selectors out of Junjo's camp Volcano created this wonderful tribute to him. While I love the tunes, it is entirely too short, less than 45 minutes this CD is over garnering 3 stars."
2,You get what you pay for,"These sheets are extremely thin and after only one week of use in a home day care, the sheets are getting small holes in them. The only plus with these is the low price and good choice of colors."
4,Eat drink and be buried,I enjoyed this book as much as the others. You become part of the family after a book or two. Can`t wait to find out what happens next.
3,A nice little Edwardian mystery!,"This book is set in the south coast of England during the Regency period (specifically 1908 for this one). Cecily finds her beloved Pennyfoot Hotel in the middle of another murder when one of her guests is found hanging from the Maypole. She of course can't resist trying to find out who the killer is since she doesn't have much faith in the police getting anywhere, so she starts asking questions. These books are nice little cozies, but the mystery in this one is pretty simple to figure out. I enjoy Cecily and her friends and staff though, so I will read more in the series."
4,Great for those who want to use less refined sugar,"I bought the honey crystals because I had been reading about how refined sugar can actually fuel cancer. Since it came in a box of 6, I gave a couple to friends to try too. I use it in my coffee in the morning, and I think it tastes great. It's easier to deal with than regular honey. I don't bake much, but the next time a recipe calls for sugar I'm going to try it there too."
3,Good reference but something missing,"It covers a lot of things that a neophyte producer might not think of but it doesn't cover a few things that I would've expected. One thing- it doesn't mention anything about forming an LLC (Limited Liability Company) in relationship to producing theater and there's almost no coverage of negotiating an ""enhanced"" production with an existing non-profit and commercial venture which I believe is the way that many new plays and musicals are developed and first presented.Perhaps that's more sophisticated than the author intended but that's what I was hoping to get some insight into. I suppose I'll have to spend a lot of money on a lawyer instead!"
1,Save your money,"I bought these with new bowls that had holes for sight plugs hoping to correct the bowl fuel level problem i've been fighting with. After i put them in, i realized that i couldn't see much through them. After installing the carb, it was a few days until i was ready to start the engine. In that time we had a string of cold nights and warm days. When i checked everything before the first start, i found that these had broken off in the holes, leaving the threads in place and the ""heads"" and o-rings sitting on my intake. Now i have to pull the bowls off and drill/tap the plug holes to remove the plastic. I don't recommend these even if you won't use them in extreme temperature changes, because they didn't appear to be very see-through when they were whole. Save your money and time and buy the metal ones."
2,Extremely short-term use,"When purchasing these, understand that they are only to be used while adjusting the float levels. I had them on for 3 or 4 days and when I took them out to place in brass plugs, the threads on these clear plugs stripped out. I thought it was strange since my carb had these same type of plugs on it for about 7 years (they obviously weren't good when I took them off either). They work well for adjusting the fuel levels, but remove them as soon as you are done with them."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought the Babble Ball for my ferrets,but they couldn't hit it hard enough to make sounds.Even the cat couldn't make it talk.It took throwing the ball against the wall or on the floor to get any sound out of it at all.One of the dogs got ahold of it when I wasn't looking,and it took him about 2 seconds to chew it in half(he's a small dog).Not quite as indestructible as advertised."
4,Good toy for cat,"I bought this toy for my sister's cat, who has every toy there is. He seemed to like the toy for awhile, then left it alone. Once in a while he goes over and nudges it, so it still keeps his interest."
5,language lover's dream!,"I bought this as a gift for my English major daughter as a pick-me-up, and it was a huge hit!"
5,Fine nuances of the English language,"Common Errors In English Usage puts the wisdom of author and English professor Paul Brians' web site, ""Common Errors in English,"" into print. Offering essential information concerning commonly misused words and phrases, from a scholar whose web site has been endorsed by BBC Online, Life magazine, USA Today, Yahoo! Internet (among others), Common Errors In English Usage is a practical, sensible, and very highly recommended ""reader friendly"" educational resource and reference for anyone seeking to improve their personal command of the fine nuances of the English language."
4,Entertaining!,"More than mere common errors, Brians' compilation explains some cleverly deceptive mistakes as well. His analysis is clear and - I admit - entertaining reading for a lover of words."
2,did not fit,i bought this to remove the nipple from my cva inline it will not fit the nipple. if you have a older cva it may not work for your gun.
4,Good the first dozen times I watched it.,"I have a 3 year old and she loves her some Wubbzy! we cut off our cable so we are streaming a fair bit of our TV. Wubbzy is one of the few shows we bought on DVD for our kid to watch. I am getting a bit tiered of some of them, but she still loves them so well worth the money!"
5,Pirate treasure for kids,"This is just perfect, I bought this dvd for my 2 years old toddler, he just loves Wubbzy and Pirates, he watch it over and over all the time,wathever makes him happy makes me happy,and is very educational for his age.we had good time with this dvd ,now he can sing and repeat most of the words on this dvd"
2,DVD Broke Straight out of the Case,"Couldn't enjoy the movie, the DVD was split in two as soon as we opened it. What a disappointment for myself for spending the cash and for my kid who never had a chance to watch the movie."
4,The Palestine Primer,"This is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the reasons for Arab hatred of Americans. I found it fascinating. It is a quick, easy read. Yet it is comprehensive: 200 numbered pages for quick reference that include a Contents page and Foreword providing an historical perspective; a 76-page Appendix documenting the facts; a 4-page Bibliography listing authoritative published sources; and a detailed Index to the contents. It details how George W. Bush, as well as U.S. presidents dating back to Harry Truman, played politics with America's reputation for justice and failed America's reputation for democracy."
2,Questionable Objectivity,"Personally, I believe this book mixes a lot of well-established facts with quite a few dubious claims and considerable omissions to arrive at a fairly mangled account of Bin Laden's motivations, the history of Arab-Israeli relations, and that conflict's contribution to the 9/11 attacks. Unfortunately, there is no way to further explore the questionable claims being made because no footnotes or endnotes are provided. You do have to wonder why someone would publish a factual account about a complex subject under a psuedonym, and without benefit of footnotes, endnotes, or page numbers. This book has to be read with considerable skepticism, and a willingness to do a lot of extra research on your own."
5,Charlie & Lola videos - used,"Perfect condition. MORE than satisfied. The ""stars"" are entertaining for ALL ages. HOURS of fun with 2 1/2 yo grandaughter!-we both love it. OUTSTANDING.Charlie and Lola, Vol. 1-8"
3,Nice product,"I got this product for my son. He love so much ""charlie and Lola"". Nice product, good price, and fast delivery. However, It wasn't enough description of the product. I thought that support the other languages, such as Spanish. It only play English. If the description has the language info ""English only"", I wouldn't buy this.Anyway it's nice and my son really love this.Thank you"
5,We love Charlie & Lola...,"My two daughters, wife and I love Charlie and Lola...""Charlie and Lola"" takes the perspective of the 5 year-old Lola on casual/ day-to-day episodes, taking the opportunity to teach valuable & fun lessons to our kids (it was helpful a couple of times, watch the one in which Lola almost ruins her brother birthday and you will understand me).I love how Lola day-dreams about everything, and how the cartoon makes those dreams alive. That must be how my daughter's brain function now... at least I hope so...Also, ""Charlie and Lola"" highlights the difference between brother/sister vs. friends relationships in a tender way.Each episode lasts about 10 minutes, which proves to be enough to explore a situation in full and come to a comforting end, yet not long enough to lose the little ones focus.Not repetitive (like Dora), not foolish (like blues clues), not violent, not annoying.Enjoy... kids grow fast!"
3,Sunsei Solar Grip Solar Panel Mounting Bracket #SE-SG1 (,"I'm using this on my boat like advertised but am baffled by the small size of clamp included for the stern pulpit on my boat. Almost all boats have 1 inch dia. pulpits and stantions. This is 3/4"" or less. It's useless. However I did use the other with limited success."
2,Good but could be better,I've been waiting for this manual for a long time. Bentley's excellent VW manuals have been very high on the quality list for quite some time so I was excited to get this manual. Overall it is a great and is a must for the DIY mechanic who needs to know more about their car and can't afford the factory workshop manuals and I think that for the majority of individuals who won't be dropping engines and trannies this will sufice. My gripes are small. No detail on a lot of misc body stuff. The transmission section mentions both the 915 and later G50 transmissions but only shows how to dismantle and repair the 915. Heater and ventilation information is sparse (as always) at best.I was surprised at how they did keep up with much of the Porsche tech bulletins that have come out during these model years as well as just the overall presentation. Very nice.Ken
5,"Porsche 911 Carrera Service Manual 1984-1989 - Coupe, Targa, and Cabriolet","Answers many questions the Haynes manual does not and has cleaer pictures and diagrams. Worth the extra cost over a Haynes manual. Very good diagrams of the DME fuel injection system and related electronics, for example."
4,Still working great after 9 months,I installed this detector 9 months ago and have had no issues. It's very sensitive and regularly detects carbon monoxide 30 feet inside the house when I have car running under the car port. I feel very secure having this as my cardon monoxide detector. I did quite a bit of research before I ordered this. It seems so many detectors have high failure rates but this seemed among the best. I'm happy to say I'm very pleased with it and would not hesitate to buy another one.
4,Works fine,"We've had this for a few months, and so far it has worked just fine. I like that it has a stand on the back, so if you don't want to hang it up on your wall, you don't have to."
1,blaaaaargh!,"having never written a review before and after hearing this trite i felt compelled to express my disappointment with this album. after seeing it in the metal section of (an unnamed p2p source) i thought to myself ""self, with a name like Farmer Boys, maybe you can expect some good 'ole southern drinkin metal, along the vein of Pantera or something"". boy was i wrong! this is nothing but a poor pathetic attempt at crappy pop metal. but its BAD pop metal. don't get me wrong, i AM one of those metal purists who hates anything mainstream and yadda yadda yadda, but i will give something a chance if it has something unique to it. this does not. lame boring riffs, uninspired lyrics, nothing original to it at all. this is the absolute bottom of the food chain in terms of mainstream mall metal. its not worth the time downloading let alone buying it. and where the hell does the name Farmer Boys fit in? theres NOTHING farmer about them!!!!"
1,Med Reader,"This book contains reworded assumptions on the concept of reframing. Disease cannot be reframed and I think this book deludes readers into believing that disease can be reframed, no, no, it cannot.I see this book as an impediment to people's true understanding of the meaning of disease."
1,Skins,Skin tore when putting it on the controller. It went from the envelope to the trash. Would NOT buy one.
2,Poor quality,"This jacket ripped before I even got it all the way on the Wii remote. The sleeve for the Nunchuck is especially fragile, and the sleeve for the Wii Remote is fragile between the holes for the buttons.If it ripps between the buttons, it is still usable. However, within the first week it started to rip between the two colors of the Wii Remote sleeve. If this rip gets much bigger, it will no longer be of use."
3,"Good, but....","Good product, but just one issue. The silicon is slippery (it is silicon after all), so I would not use it for the main Wii mote. However, I have continued to use the nunchuk sleeve because it does offer a better grip compared to using nothing. Both sleeves fit great. If you have the original sleeve that comes with the Wii mote, I would use only the silicon nunchuk sleeve. Like I said, it can be slippery if you use it on the Wii mote (especially if it gets sweaty), but it also is a pain to take it on/off to replace batteries (making it more likely to tear). However, if you lost/broke the original, this is a good, fun, and cheap replacement."
1,Arrived Torn - Cheap Materials,The product arrived tattered and torn. The material must be cheap. I would not purchase again.
1,GAVE MY SISTER AND I ACNE,"Oh yes, definitely looks great on and has excellent coverage. It's like I instantly have flawless skin and you can't tell I am wearing make up. But it gave both my sister and I the worst acne I have ever had in my life. Seriously, my skin looked like a before picture for proactiv. Took me awhile to figure out it was the makeup, but sure enough, my nose and chin, the only.spots I didn't.put the makeup, were acne clear. And then my sister has managed to get her skin clear for a while now, but she broke out shortly after using this product on her cheeks- the only spot she put it on. If your skin has been a previous battle with acne, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT"
4,Great if you apply it the correct way,"I honestly regretted making my purchase on this makeup at first. I bought this, concealer, and the powder. I used a makeup sponge to apply first and it looked like i had no makeup on....no coverage and it was streaky.I realized quickly that this makeup truely absorbs on a sponge and is meant to be applied with a brush or hands. I put 2.5 dots on each cheek, 1 on forehead and 1 on chin and use my hands to blend. The heat of my hands melts and blends it perfectly and gives me excellant coverage. It is pricey but for the small amount it takes to cover face it will last a long time!"
1,like wearing paint,"I love Estee Lauder products, but this particular one is like applying Dutch Boy paint to your face. Couldn't even use it."
1,complete with all of the stereotypes you would expect in a book about a Muslim society,"If you enjoy reading stereotypes formulated by white westerners about people of the ""third world"" then this book is for you. It is complete with a cold and distant virgin wanting man and lots of the authors liberal American buffoonery ie her ""love"" and ""fascination"" with Afghanistan. White liberals of the west love to attach themselves to various non European culturals, it makes them feel very righteous and worldly. Ultimately the book is boring, poorly written and full of the expected stereotypes you would expect to find in a book about a Muslim society written by a white westerner. If you really want to learn about Afghanistan I would recommend a book written by an Afghan such as, West of Kabul, East of New York by Tamim Ansary."
1,Unrealistic and unempathetic,"One's desire for a peek inside Afghan culture and it's people should not look toward this novel for truth. Plagued with ideology that is extremely brash and unacceptable in Afghanistan, this book is riddled with stereotypes only Western society can conjure. To get a better view of the Afghanistan that was and is, please read West of Kabul, East of New York by Mir Tamim Ansary. His literary work brings together Afghan society, Western Society, and the Afghan Diaspora having to assimilate, compensate, and come to peace between the two."
2,SO MUCH ABOUT NOTHING; BORING,"WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT ANN MARLOW'S EXPLORATIONS INTO HER AFFAIR OF NINE MONTHS WITH A GUY CALLED AMIR-DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS, TRY IT FOR YOURSELF AND FIND OUT. BORING IN THE EXTREME-TALK ABOUT PUTTING YOUR TO SLEEP. IF SHE IS A WRITER, SO I AM. IT IS SO VAGUE,SKIPPING FROM POINT TO ANOTHER--CONFUSING. DID NOT LIKE IT-WAS NOT WORTH MY TIME TO READ. DH"
3,Interesting but not cohesive,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. It delves into the lives of these 5 empresses and how they came to power. I didn't expect the book to get into too much detail about each empress since that would involve volumes. However, since the author pretty much followed the chronological path, I did expect it to remain that way until the end. What I found was that characters and events sometimes showed up more than once in the same context and other times, characters and events were mentioned way out of chronological order. I found myself having to flip back/forth many times to keep everything straight. If you want an overview of these 5 women and their contribution to Russian history, this is a good read. If you are looking for something more ""meaty"" - then this isn't the book for you."
2,Not a great video,"I ordered this video as I recently started cracking whips. The man who stars in this video may know a lot about fighting and martial arts, but when he picks up a whip, he reminds me of Joe Piscopo from the karate movie, Sidekicks. This whip instructor looks like he is just swinging wildly about as he attempts to show different strikes with the whip. In theory he has some good information, but the execution is less than poor. In comparison with several other cracking videos I recently received, the professional crackers show much more finesse and fluid movement and frankly I would be much more frightened to attack one of them than this guy. As I said, he really knows how to fight, but I would recommend he take some lessons on how to crack and then re-shoot his video. I was disappointed with this video."
3,Great for general knowledge of working with metal clay,"I was interested in making jewelry by carving metal clay. I didnt know where to start so I looked up books on the topic and from the cover I figured it would have what I was looking for. It covered making hallow items, mending broken pieces and just about every variation of sculpting small pieces. Great book, full of fun projects"
2,The Art Of Metal Clay (with dvd),"I liked the book, but very dissapointd that the DVD did not work. also there was no phone number to call amazon and request a new DVD so I would not have to return the book."
4,Great book,"This book answered so many questions I had about using metal clay and is a wonderful reference for me. My only issue is the DVD, it arrived scratched and while it plays it does hang up in a few places."
5,Wonderful resource for a beginner,"I bought this book based on the 'look inside' content and was not disappointed. It has clear directions, inspiring examples and was very modestly priced."
1,Handcrafted = poor quality,Check out the pictures I upload first before you decide to buy this box. The quality of the box is very poor. A lot of tool marks on the surface. The outline of brass doesn't match the recess on the wood either. No finishing at all on the inside. It's the worst purchase I've ever made online.
4,Excellent product,"I love OVI Avoplex Moisture Replenishing Lotion. Compared to the other hand and body lotions on the market, it is exceptional. It moisturizes without leaving any kind of greasy feel at all, and it's light and pleasant on the skin. I saw a difference in my skin after only using it for a short time. After I tried Avoplex the very first time, my other lotions got pushed aside and I used it exclusively.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I accidentally ordered the fragrance-free version instead of the regular and I really missed the light fragrance of the regular lotion. Without fragrance, this product is not as enjoyable to use, because the fragranced version is very pleasant and the fragrance-free has a slight natural (although nonoffensive) odor of its own, like nearly all fragrance-free products do. It's still the same product, though, and my skin just drinks it up and looks wonderful as a result."
4,Highlight of 1983,"When I think back to 1983, the music from this album just comes to mind. An album that I played to death and is easily his best work in the 80's. After that he was unable to recapture the magic, in my opinion. 'Cold as Xmas' is one of the most beautiful ballads ever written, but as we all know, Elton was always good at putting a ballad together. The album features some outstanding album tracks including 'Saint' and 'Crystal'. The singles from this album are many including 'Im Still Standing' and 'Kiss the Bride'. The album's greatest highlight is the title track which sends shivers up my spine. This album could be considered a greatest hits package in it's own right, and is worth considering if you want just one of his albums. If you want two, let me suggest the brilliant 'Don't Shoot Me I'm...'"
3,The warp engines prove to be harmful to the universe!,"An average story about Warp engines and how they can damage the universe! After investigating a Ferengi ship adrift in space, the ship is soon disabled by two aliens who board the Enterprise in an effort to convince the Federation that warp drive is harmful to the universe."
5,aaron carter coks my universal stratosphere,"Last month when my father died i thought i would never get over it. Then, the day after he died when i was strolling through target i happened upon this cd. The cover was so catchy i just had to buy it. I recomend this cd to all true music fans. It helped me through the roughest time of my life. on the way home from target that day i was listening to this cd and i ran over my little sister. it was ok though because i had aaron carter to get me through the court hearings. i hope this will be a lesson to all you ""emo""and ""indie rock"" fans out there because this is where the REAL music is mofos! suck on dat!"
1,oh my,"This cd is just horrible. Aaron is not talented. He should be shot for making something as horrible as this. Get some real music like Pj Harvey's ""Is This Desire?"" or Tori Amos' ""From The Choirgirl"". You may not like either of them, but at least they have the talent Aaron doesn't have. I hope this is his last album. Oh and Aaron fans, don't give those 2 albums I mentioned bad reviews unless you've actually HEARD them."
2,oh Aaron...SHUT UP,"He puts a classic song(One Bad Apple) to shame. He made that song sound like mice were singing it. Even now, he still sux. I have to admit he has his brothers good looks.... but not talent."
1,Sh*t,"Isn't it amazing what the music industry has come to. We have 11 year old playing possibly the gayest music imaginable. I hear that either Aaron Carter or his brother is a Metallica fan. Maybe he should pick up a guitar and learn how to do something other then sing someone elses lyrics, and try to make decent music. Until then, we shouldn't have to b subjected to such garbage."
1,One star is one too many,"This is without a doubt the worst CD that I have ever listened to. He has no talent and only used his brother's name to get into the business. He should return to the music business in about ten or twenty years when his vocal cords have developed. Aaron Carter should go back to the 5th grade and finish school. People shouldn't give him 5 stars just b/c he is young and they feel sorry for him or think that people should give him a break! Who Cares? If Aaron Carter is your cup of tea, I am happy for you, but this personally, was not mine."
5,His best album yet.,"This is one of aarons best albums. I love these songs ""I gonna miss you forever"" ""Crazy little party girl"" and ""Ain't that cute"" His music is great just for a 9 year old. This is a really great cd."
2,Give Aaron a break,"Yes he is young and hasn't reached puberty yet, but his album is cute, and upbeat. The lyrics are simple, but what do you expect, some little boy singing swear words and hard core? Many little girls love him, and even girls beyond his years. Give him a few more years, and he'll be the next big thing."
1,THIS is Nick Carters brother?,"Aaron Carter may be Nick Carters brother, but obviously his brother got all the talent in the family. His voice may mature and grow out of this sqeaky chipmunk phase, but I can tell he'll NEVER live up to his brother. He should focus on living a normal life, instead of pathetically trying (and failing) to live in his brother's footsteps. The only reason he is getting any publicity at all is because of Nick, and even that will fade soon when people realize that Aaron hasn't inherited even a billionth of Nicks talents."
3,Too young????,"Hi I'm 12 and I think that Aaron's voice is good but, he shouldn't be singing about stuff like this. He's kinda young. I bet all the Aaron Carter fans want to kill me, but no boys Aaron's age even go out with girls yet. On the other hand, Aaron is a little cutie patootie!!!!!"
1,stoopid,this album is lame. I dunno why I bought it! All the songs are really really bad. Thank goodness for gullible teeny boppers though...I told one that it was nick's brother and she paid me 20 bucks for it...hahaha
1,???,"whoever let this kid into the recording studio and signed him must have been on crack! this kid has ZERO talent! The only reason people are buying this crap is because he's Nick Carter's little brother! Oh and he is NOT cute either! This music is horrible, if you can even call it music. All he did was steal other people's songs and beats and remade them with his pathetic voice."
1,AAGHHH!!!,The Go-Go's drunk is what comes to mind when I hear this artist. And you thought Hanson was bad.
5,This album is awesome!,"I bought this album after I saw Aaron in concert opening for the BSB. I have to say, this boy has major talent. (maybe he gets it from his brother... :-) He started singing on stage and I thought ""Wow!""...and THEN he did backflips across the stage. Ok, how many of you could do that at 10 years old along with singing and dancing in front on thousands of people? This album has a lot of great songs on it, especially Get Wild. The upbeat songs are great to dance to and the slower ballads are awfully ""cute."" So he's only 10...give him credit. He has natural talent that will only get better with time. (oh ya, and he sure could kick Britney Spears'.... well, you know)."
5,I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ALL!!!!!,"I can't believe you all are being mean to him,I mean I thinks he's doing good singing for his age and Aaron you deserve FIVE STARS!!! I think you the best."
1,worst thing that happened to music,How can someone say aaron carter is the best thing that happened to music??? more like the worst. This album is just plain BAD. Don't buy it. Anyone who likes it must be on acid or something!
4,AIN'T HE CUTE,"Ok so most of the people bought the CD to try and impress Nick. I'm sure many of you were suprised to hear Aaron can actually sing (what else would you expect from the Carter Clan). I have the CD and I think it's great. I know you're thinking it's a CD for teeny boppers, WRONG. I'm 22 and I think Aaron is VERY talented. He's really sweet too I went to 10 BSB concerts this summer and was never further back then the 6th row and Aaron was an excellent choice for Opener. He's really nice too I have an autograph he signed for me personally on my desk at home. I do agree though that CD is not for everyone it is a lot of bubblegum music but if you can get over the idea that he's 10 and listen to the music I think you would enjoy"
1,"More from him? GOD, WHY?",Just look at the expression on his face. He assumes that we really think he can jump that high without aid from a trampoline. Are we fools? If anyone wanted to torture me they could handcuff me to a chair and put headphones on me with this hideous junk playing.
1,This is the worst CD ever,"God, what bitches of the music industry. They grab a 10-year old out of the 5th grade and ask him to sing, and he does and has no talent, but still use him as a damn lip syncher that has a girl's voice. His cover is gay like he's about to lick someone and his songs make me gag, as well as his voice. Girls are saying he's so hot with that hair cut but I think he needs plastic sugery cause he is so damn ugly with that long hair and looks like a girl. Damn, i hate those people, they just squeezed the hell out of this little kids from the streets to make him sing. I'm in hell when I hear this CD, so I will never listen to this again. End of Aaron Carter (hopefully) and my review"
1,crap,"just because he is young doesn't give him an excuse not to be able to sing. he can't sing, if you actually LISTEN to it rather than gushing over him you will find that out too. he shouldnt put anything out till he can sing. so yeah, all you saying the same old stuff about ""ohh hes just 10 of course he cant sing take it easy on him blah blah blah"" well just cuz he was 10 at the time, has nothing to do with it he just cant sing, many 10 year olds can sing, just not this one"
1,Terrible!,"And to think, before I heared this, I used to tolerate the song 'One Bad Apple'....What am I doing here anyway?"
2,Whatever,"This kid is such a dove. But he's only 10 and he sings about love? Sure...and I'm Barney. Well... maybe I am.... I admit, he has talent. It's just not completly developed yet. Just wait for puberty, then he'll be cool."
2,Aaron sounded like a girl and the songs were too 1980's,"We rate him with two stars because of a great lack in a male or at least boyish tone. We found ourselves wondering if we chose the incorrect performer (a girl or young woman). If this is honestly and truly the way Aaron sounds we are sorry to have been so unkind to Aaron and Amazon. Amazon, we love the shopping privelige! Thanks, Danip & Samantha"
1,um...,"I have nothing against this kid, but jeez...he's what, like 10 and he's singing about girls, and love and a bunch of other crud that he's way too young for...he seems to have captured everything that drives me crazy about poeple his age in this album, that's all..."
5,I luv it!,I luv it! Aaron Carter is soooo adorible! He sounds a lot like a young Taylor Hanson! :o) This is one of my favorite CDs! This is a must Buy!
5,Aaron Carter Is The Best!,"Aaron Carter is soooo talented. His CD is the best! On a further note, all of you people who are writting bad things about him should just stop. He was ten when he made this CD. And he is NOT singing bad totally age inapropriate things like some people out there. His voice is sweet and since he was young when this was made, he's basically singing about puppy love. And yes, people do develop crushes at ten. I would recommend this CD for everyone. It'll cheer you up."
1,HE NEEDS HELP!,"Aaron Carter needs to hit puberty before he even thinks about singing! Why would anyone want to embarrass themselves like this! This record stinks! There are no good rhythms, and it hurts my ears to listen to him whine! Whoever reads this comment, please trust my judgement. DONT BUY IT!"
5,To all of the negitive people that hate him,...when you were 9...I bet you had a high pitch voice that sounded like a chipmunk. I sure know I did...Just give his music a chance. Don't listen to those 30 sencond clips...SO WHAT IF HIS BIG BRO HELPED HIM!!P>Well anyways Just give a chance and you will like him.
2,Another Scary Album!!,"My little sister is a HUGE Aaron Carter fan, so she made my parents get this c.d. for her. Why,oh, WHY couldn't she have gotten one of Aaron's newer albums?! This is just awful. Sure, Aaron Carter has grown up and sounds MUCH better, but this is from when he was nine years old! ('m not kidding! I read his bio!) Who in their right mind gives a nine-year old a record deal? Hmmmm, it must be because his older brother is already a famous and popular singer! He sounds like a little girl, and I can't stand guys that sound like little girls. I think Aaron Carter needed to take voice lessons. His voice is so high-pitched and squeaky! It's a good thing his voice has changed and he has grown- he sounds much better now!"
5,Awesome CD from a kid!!!,"Aaron Carter's first CD may be his best one. It has awesome dance tracks like ""Shake It"", ""Crush On You"", and some sweet songs like ""I'm Gonna Miss You Forever"" and ""Ain''t That Cute"" I recommed this CD to any person who is into pop music."
3,My 2 cents...,"I've just browsed all reviews, having fun to see all those people juggling with stars and letting off steam or declaring eternal love with Aaron Carter. Let's face it - it's all about money. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel that as long as you BUY, you do what you're expected to.I give three stars. One for music, one for lyrics, and one for Aaron himself.Best regards, Anders"
1,Someone get this kid back to Elementary school!,"I dont have to come up with a lot of words to describe my disgust for this album, considering a LOT of others agree with me. These are some of the most pathetic songs I have heard in my life. And I do believe one of the songs (""Please Don't Go Girl"") is a NKOB cover song! This is as worse as it gets. Considering since Aaron has no talent whatsoever, and he has the brain of a four year old, some other idiot must have come up with this sh**. Who would? Nick? What if..? Yeah, Nick probably did."
1,Trash,"A waste of time, money, paper and plastic. What has the music industry come to? This is a disgrace to the word 'music' cause this isn't music. This is a beyond immature, talentless, stupid and pointless album, released by an even more hopeless musician. Aaron Carter obviously has no talent, and probably never will. I personally pleased to say I have only seen one video by him, and that instantly disgusted me. I wonder why some people wasted their money on this worthless collection of tunes.A disgrace."
2,Obviously Nick got all the talent.,"This CD stinks like poo! Not to be mean to aaron, but really! Hes only 11 and already singing about love and girls and shtuff. The only songs that are decent is crush on you and aint that cute. Aaron's songs have no rythem or beat. If you want REAL music,get BSB BABY! BSB RULZ THE WORLD 4- EVER! YEAH BABY YEAH! 1"
1,is this a boy or a girl?,this 12 year old boy makes me laugh! he's either a girl or is voice is so bad like his brother so he has girl's sing for him or her whatever he is
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"I thought Aaron's first cd would be his last but no, some people actually like the idea of Nick's brother singing. Something's messed up. This kid has the voice of a girl I swear."
1,Nahhh,He just wasnt ready to be making an album. I hear ambition but not talent. I Never hear his voice without it being overproduced.
1,B-A-D,I thought Hanson was the worst! He ranks right with them. The only reason he got into a recording studio is just beacuse of his brother. He sounds like any 11 year old. His voice is practically computerized! He is just plain bad!
5,this is cute sugar-coated pop,doesn't anyone remember the good old sugar pop days? i don't im almost 11 and my sisters just gave this to me as a hand-me-down i listned to i will be yours and loved the whole cd right away aaron's pop days are over and it's jive's fault but seriously this is one of the cutest cd's i have ever heard aaron is definitely not gay! billy gilman and dream street sound a bit like a better aaron even if billy is country anyways its cute but you can actually download the whole cd but buy it for the pictures
2,He has grown up now.,"Aaron doesn't stink that much. I suppose too many people want to be him or doing what he's doing - all those jealous people out there. Anyway, this CD is far from the best I've heard, but it works great if you're kid around 5 to 10 years old. Aaron had a cute voice back then, but he and his music has matured and grown away from this album. If you are an Aaron-fan, you probably bought this record long ago. For right now, he's working on his 6th album ""Saturday Night"" - sorry, can't help it! I am excited!"
5,cool person cool songs...,"wHATZZ uPp!!!!I've heard that many people met him.I'll hear the same thing over and over again.AARON CARTER ROCKS/AARON CARTER IS VERY COOL!! and so on...I really-eally agree with them cause aaron TOTALLY Rockzz...I may not have all his cool cd's and posters and pictures andso on...but,just like all his crazy's fan might say, AARON143!!!!!!But the thing that I would say is CONGRATS & GOODLUCK 4 YOUR FUTUREUNDER TAKING!Moshi-Moshi and Sayonara!!!"
4,AARON KEEP ROCKING,The first time I was listing to him I thought well he's ok and as I went from song to song I noticed that he was great for such a yough boy. I was like wow he's as good as his big bro! I love I'm gonna miss you forever. And bolth of the Carters are so hot! You guys rock keep it up! Aaron and BSB forever!!!!!
5,AARONS ALBUM IS SOO GOOD!,"Aaron carter was only about 9 years old when he made this album, so thats why his voice isn't fully mature yet. If you have heard aaron's newer song have some fun with the funk on the pokemon soundtrack you can defenately tell his voice has matured somewhat, nevertheless hes such a great preformer, he will be such a huge preformer when he gets a little older, you just wait and see! hes such a entergetic danceing cutie! Trust me, youll apreciate this album once u get to know him!"
5,he's so cute!!!!!,I just love this cd. i love all the songs and i think he's soooooooooooo cute!!!!! People sould not make fun of him cuz he's 11 he'll just get better
4,Maybe...,"This guy is cute, for sure!But, no offence or anything, cause I am his age, but he has a really high voice, like regular pre teen guys. But once he's about 14, he will be a hit, for sure! Not only is he sooooo cute, I guess his voice is ok for his age. But what he sings about really bugs me. I mean, singing about love? He was only 10 when this came out, and he was singing I'm gonna miss you forever? More like for at least 15 year old guys!"
1,NOOOOOOO!,"Every time I hear Aaron's music, I scream!!! No, not a joyful scream, a horror scream! Aaron is satan! He is evil! Don't listen to this cd or you will go under his evil spell too! I can't believe this cd is almost platinum in Canada where I live...I guess NOFX is right, canadians are stupid, at least the ones that bought aaron's cd."
1,PLEASE...,"I REALLY THINK THIS CD IS JUST... JUST... THERE AREN'T WORDS TO EXPRESS IT, BUT PLEASE DON'T BUY IT."
5,The Kid Can Sing!!,"This album was great. Aaron has lots of pop and dance tunes with catchy beats, and cute lyrics. I liked ""Please Don't Go Girl"", which is a remake of the song by the New Kids on the Block, and ""One Bad Apple"" which is a remake, too. His voice slightly resembles a young Michael Jackson, but it's not as strong. But Aaron sings his little heart out, and does a good job at it, too. His big brother Nick sings in the background of one song, and Nick and Brian from BSB even wrote a song for the album. Aaron shows major talent (he was only 10!) and I think the kid has got potential. He's gonna be a star."
2,Well...,"There's nothing great here. No Max Martin-penned pop masterpieces, no great harmonies, nothing catching fire. This is about as pre-teen as it gets. I doubt this kid is even interested in girls yet. I guess I just shouldn't expect as much from someone who covers the New Kids On The Block."
2,Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh! This is NOT cool...,"Ok, I completely think everbody has the right to say what they want, so I'll do that. My sister bought this cd and the 1st thing I thought was ""Is he a chipmunk?"" I like BSB's music, but not them. The only good thing I would have to say about this cd is that he is trying and I have to give him that credit and also 1 or 2 of the songs could be OK if a talented performer sang them, but not Aaron. What's even more surprising is (if you want to call me a teeny-bopper) I like Hanson, 'N Sync, 5ive, and only BSB's SONGS. I was a fan of NKOTB. So I guess I like(d) every teeny-bopper group/band there ever was except for him. Go get Hanson, 5ive, and 'N Sync if you're looking for some WONDERFUL pop music, but PLEASE take my warning about this cd. DO NOT BUY IT!! MAYBE some day Aaron Carter will be a little (or a lot) better, but until then, p u to this!!!"
1,Horrible.,I feel for the parents of preteens who are begging to own this filth...as it stands this is standard packaged pop flop. Teach your kids the value of money by explaining why they you can't afford this; your ears and your CD player will thank you.
1,Where's Aaron Carter?,"I don't see him anywhere on this cover. I see a little girl jumping, but not him. I also hear a little girl singing his songs, but not him. Wait, is that actualy him? Oh sorry. My mistake.Mike Morrison"
4,Works!,"Well, what can I say, it works! Don't know whether it's better, the same, or worse than the stock battery. I just alternated the batteries each day and then used the camera. One didn't seem better than the other. In fact, to be honest, unless you do a TON of diving and recording I'm not 100% sure you'll even need the extra battery. I shot a LOT of underwater video and never got the ""low battery"" message. But I guess it's not a bad idea to be prepared."
4,digital camera battery,Could not find in the local stores and when did much more expensive. Good deal for the battery. Shipped immediately.
3,The battery is a tad too tight...not a perfect fit.,"It servers its purpose for me as a backup battery. I haven't actually used the thing yet for the life of the battery, but it seems to hold a charge well. The only problem is that it's literally a millimeter too long, and that does make for a bit of a tight fit. I didn't need tweezers (although you might if you're a geriatric or have serious arthritis), however, I found if I put a little pressure on the battery's case with my index finger and roll it out, it seems to come out."
3,Works good as a backup,"It works OK, but doesn't seem to be as good as the original Sanyo battery. For the price I paid I'll give a thumbs up as a good backup battery!"
2,get what you pay for,i bought this with the xacti vid cam and i compared both batteries fully charged and used them at a concert and this one dies a lot faster than the factory one. I'd say you would have to get 2 of these to equal up to one of the factory batteries. its a give and take since the price is so cheap. i still recommend getting these ones
3,Extra battery for Exacti 2,It came on time. Paid almost as much for shipping as I did for battery. I knew that. Battery came in handy as I needed extra power. it worked out fine.
1,Batteries fail to recharge,"I have purchased several of these Lenmar batteries, and each of them eventually began failing to recharge while the original Sanyo batteries have continued working reliably charge after charge. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Metal?,"I did a lot of on-line research before I chose this tray. Overall, this is a nice looking product for the price. Too early to tell how it will perform over time. Reviewers mentioned a great gel pad and a need for Loctite. I agree on both counts. I alude to my main complaint (I consider it a major one!) in the title - The product specs say the tray is metal. It is definitely not! Nice looking, but not very strong plastic. I might have chosen differently had I known. One other lesser complaint - The specs describe a 12"" depth. Technically that's true. However, it is mounted on 14"" slides! Also, the instructions are as bad as others say. But... Come back to the price, and it's not a bad buy."
4,pretty good,"works great,just some of the screws didn't come with it but It didn't really bother me since I have a garage full of the screws it took lol"
4,Great buy.,This is a great keyboard tray with a slide out mouse pad. Assembly instructions not the best but figured it out and it works great. Sturdy and wonderful gel pad for wrists.
2,Keyboard Drawer,"After a few months of light use, the screws fell out, jamming the sliding track. Had to completely disassemble and reassemble product. Would recommend using Locktite when putting this together. This unit is a little flimsy, bends easily when using the mouse, causing a flex that probably caused the screws to loosen."
1,Junk,"It can only be used on your left ear. The cord is way too short, 3 ft??? Come on guys... Got this as a present, so I'm stuck with this lump of plastic now.... Looking to get rid of it.... Maybe to the trash, because who would want such a poorly designed product...???"
5,Best KISS Tribute I have heard,"This is by far the best KISS tribute album. There are plenty of heavy hitters (like Dee Snider from Twisted Sister, Tommy Shaw from Styx, Kip Winger from Winger, Lemmy from Motorhead, etc). Awesome vocals (even by Chris Jerico on ""King of the Night Time World"") and killer guitar work (Jennifer Batten who has worked with Michael Jackson, C. C. Deville from Poison, even former KISS member Bruce Kulick contributes in a stellar performance of ""God of Thunder"". This blows the ""Kiss My A**"" tribute album totally away!!"
3,Disappointed....,I think this is the only book I have ever read that I had a hard time picturing what was going on in my mind. The story line and charactors were great but I wasn't really impressed with how the book was written.
3,Weird book,"I bought this book because if focuses on addiction and particularly eating disorders. I like that this book explores the 12 step premise for both OA and AA.I liked the characters although I was not overly fond of Erika and her weird, weird thinking (although I can see the relationship between her thinking and her illness) - still some of it was a bit much.What I did not like and thought was very, very weird was the basic storyline. Just not believable in anyway and fell very flat. I am sure the author could have come up with a better introduction for these two people.Finished the book in two days and felt cheated somehow. Of course, the ending is also a little too pat."
4,great little alien scifi,"Not your usual alien movie. Shot without a script on a small budget, its better than I expected. If you're into aliens, conspiracy theories, stuff like David Icke, you'll love this film. Alien implants, government cover ups, alien abduction, mind control, shape shifting, ufos, metaphysics... it's all in there. watch it a few times and you'll catch the hidden messages in the details. Enjoyed it."
1,My butt can sing better than Sass Jordan!,"At least that's what my wife said after seeing Sass on the Canadian Idol final. I'd have to agree. Sass is a buttsmack, worse yet a squalling buttsmack who can't hold a tune. Lay off the smokes Sass!!!By the way, some may say my cat makes better music hacking up a hairball. That's the truth!!!!"
5,"My Second-best ""Israel In Egypt"" Recording","I have two complete Israel in Egypt recordings. This rendition is, for mostly subjective reasons not quite as good as the Parrott led rendtion. The choruses aren't quite as clear and defined IMHO and it just was not quite as pleasing to my ear as an arm-chair concert-goer. Since this work is not widely performed, an avid Handel oratorio fan might not get to hear this work in concert but, having sung it once, I can assure you that this one is better than most you are likely to see in concert. My advice is to get both and enjoy both!"
5,Great Condition,"This book was received in such great condition, I was totally surprised. I have never bought a book online before. It was received in a very timely manner. What actually caught me was the price. I never thougt I could buy this book at this price. Also, I have to mention, I have been trying to find this book for one year in all the bookstores in my area and no one seemed to carry it and when I ordered it, they could not produce. Thanks amazon.com."
2,"Okay, but I've heard better","Language Of Light 2 is a little more like the traditional, watered down American technoid stuff. There are few tracks on here that are mildly entertaining, but nothing that's going to get your blood pumping. Maybe this CD is geared more toward fans of the jungle techno sound, but I can't recommend it personally. It's too slow and bland for my tastes. Check out the Burning Man Live compilation or Astral Projection's releases if you want some good acid/trance techno."
4,Pretty good little book,"I am still becomming familiar with the book but must admit that it is user friendly for the most part. The only objection I have thus far is that I do not like portions written in white ink on a colored background. I find them hard to read. The print is on the small side but in black ink it is readable; in the white, I find it a problem. Thankfully, not much of the book is presented this way.I like the organization of the book and can tell that it will be useful in many circumstances. I am pleased that I purchased the book and will bring it to France with me. The size of the book is good in that it will fit in a jacket pocket as well as not being too noticeable when I consult it and try not to look like the tourist I will be."
2,Disappointment after some great reviews,"I bought this book over the Berlitz because of some great reviews. Unfortunately the fact that different fonts are used to separate languages was not mentioned. Looking at the book on the ""look inside"" feature does show this, but it's much bigger than the actual book so I didn't realize how difficult it would be to read until I got the actual book. Because the fonts are necessarily small, to keep the book small, the different-colored fonts were almost impossible for me to read, rather negating the ""handiness"" of the layout or anything else. If you can't read it, what's the point. Luckily a friend lent me the Berlitz, and side by side, I could easily read the Berlitz but not the Rough Guide. I'd have to be in very good light AND put on reading glasses - neither of which is necessary with the Berlitz. If I had known this, I wouldn't have bought the book. For anyone ""of a certain age"" who may have trouble with this feature, I would definitely pass on this book."
5,Something I'd Been Waiting For.,"I'm a great collector of Christmas music, preferring the traditional and nostalgic. For many years one could only get the same few songs from before 1950. This two disc collection is pretty generous and includes rarities like the Nat King Cole Trio's 'Jingle Bells' and lots of big band novelties. I'd also recommend the ASV/Living Era largely British Christmas discs, if you can still find them. The original Capitol Records Christmas on the Range has old country stuff that's great, and I love Blue Christmas (also out of print?)with Johnny Otis, Sugar Chile Robinson, and several jump blues greats. one can have a lot of fun without burning out on Bing Crosby or the tasteless Mariah Carey, though I commend her...volume.Anyway, this is a great start if you likie swing music, crooners, and Santa Claus.Happy Christmas!"
1,not ready for prime time,Three times we tried and three times the product went back. Each time there was a mfg defect. The first time it did not seal properly. What good is a whistling tea kettle that doesn't whistle???? Amazon customer service was excellent at exchanging the product until we gave up.
2,Do Not Get These Cds!,"ugh, These Cds are horrible.ProsYou can rewrite themThey come with their own casesThey can hold up to 20 songsConsThey have errors on themThey can't play on a car stereo or StereoThey are easily breakable.I felt that I made a bad decision buying these, and I hope I stop you from buying these with this review."
2,not what i was looking for,"i was looking for a cd-rw for my standalone cd recorder for my stereo system which took ""audio recordable disc only"". even though this says ""music"" on the front of the package it didn't work. i did end up buying the tdk brand music recordable discs."
1,Useless CD's,Got the error message when trying to burn mp3 as dataNot even letting me erase the disk - getting an error message at that step as well
1,Poor Quality,This product is no good to burn music. Music kept skipping. Just a poor quality CD. DO NOT BUY THIS!
3,"Inexpensive and good color, but really thin","This paper is really inexpensive, and produces fairly good color on my Deskjet 940C. Only problem: it's only a bit thicker than normal printer paper.. I'd say it's good for ""for-fun"" or home businesses that don't really need to look overly professional, but I'd never hand them out for a real business."
1,Terrible paper guality,"It is not well perforated and it does not print well. It may be cheap, but I got what I paid for..."
2,Micro Perforation is terrible,"I had some Avery business cards left over and was able to compare side by side. This a clearly an inferior product. Can't tear the perforations and get a clean edge. When comparing apples to apples, these are rotten. The paper is crummy quality too, it's mealy and lacks crispness.The white is a nice clean white though"
4,Good [inexpensive] product,This type of paper is very good at a very [inexpensive] price. Buy this one if you are in the business card printing business.
4,Great Intro for Frontpage,This book has several good aspects and angles for the beginning user. I like the layout and the practical examples that it shows. It also has lot of nice screen captures which helps the reader along.
1,You'll get much less than what you pay for,"I was looking for decent spotted spoon and saw these. 44 pieces for $15 seems bargain but I was not expecting in good quality either. Actually, thsese are much worse than what I expected. The edges of the plastic spoons are peeling right out of the box. All items feel very low quality. There's no description those spoons are good for heat. I'm returning mine.I can't believe I got such quality in the United States!! Purchase these only if you want to cook at a beach house for a weekend and left them forever... like disposals."
3,10 at walmart with another name,"Actually I got the same set at walmart for 10 bucks there not that bad for 10. but then again im a college student that don't do much cooking. If the where 20 bucks, i say they are horrible, there is absolutely no feel at all. The blade bends easily and I always have a feeling that im going to cutmyself.they are what the promise thought, 44 piece of stuff that never need sharpening.Again 10bucks then good 20 is bad."
4,Good Review of Calc. but set aside some time!,"This book is very well done. The authors break up the material nicely (23 chapters with short exams scattered in between)and by offering practical application problems to compliment the purely mathematical ones. Be aware though that this book is over 400 pages long! It's not cliff notes. You need to spend some time with it to reap its full benefits. Also, it cuts out some of the theoretical explanations of a standard math text, so you need a bit of experience beforehand. Otherwise, the book is a really good find. I used this book to review math concepts before I began grad school."
5,Great for self Studying,"A lot of examples. It covers a lot for The AP exam, and easily understood. It shows you each step for the problems. Theres an exam after each ubit so you can be aware what you know and do not know."
3,Just okay,"It's okay didn't use it much I could have kept my money. The shipping was terrible,but the book it self is just okay."
4,With Toquinho & Bethania En La Fusa [IMPORT],"Beautifully arranged and played.Listen carefully to No.2 and enjoy the ""setting up"" of the samba mood that follow by Toquinho's guitar.Makes you wonder why did we miss this alive performance...if you do not understand portuguez listen to the piano in the background and the little sayings of Toquinho's guitar and sooon you will say with every body...Sarava!.If you want more of this ; look for the recording with Maria Creuza and you will have all the beauty of this two performers from Bahia"
3,"Easy to use, but could be better","Comparing the Stanley to the Hilti, I felt the Stanley was the better unit by an online comparison of the products. It is easy to use, but I believe the Hilti woudl have been the better choice; as it is better built. The Stanley has a plastic viewer, the Hilti has a glass viewer. The Hilti case is better built also. I am not sorry about purchasing the Stanley, but most likely would purchase the Hilti next time."
5,Picard and Crusher . . . will they or won't they?,"For all of you TNG fans, especially the ones who have felt that Picard and Crusher should be together, you won't be disappointed. This is a poignant story - one that has made it to my ""favorite TNG episodes"" list. I've always been a softie for a love story. The story line regarding the Kes and the Prytt is just a little bonus. The big story is Picard and Crusher."
1,Love Music,the wrong cd's came in the case still waiting on the right cd's.after waiting almost three weeks the item.
2,Boring and repetitive,"All but one of the scenes in this video are *exactly* the same: a girl starts in her underwear, takes it off, and then dances around for five minutes. Even the girls all look the same; they are all pale non-descript redheads. The only changes from scene to scene are what the girl is wearing (and nothing is very interesting) and where she is. In one case she is in the pool, which I suppose is a bit more interesting, but still not terribly exciting. The video does end with one lesbian scene, but it wasn't as hot as similar scenes in other Penthouse videos. If only Penthouse could get back to the style of their old ""Women in Uniform"" video: a silly but coherent plot putting the girls into sexy situations. As it is nobody is putting any thought at all into these videos."
2,Will Penthouse ever move out of its 80's Rocker phase?,"Indeed, this is the best example of erotic (...)-trap in existence. If you are attracted, like most red blooded men, to the lovely Aimee Sweet - then don't buy this video. Let me explicate a scene for you. The attractive and lush Aimee walks into a room wearing a tight buisness outfit, but before she can begin to take it off, a bad 80's guitar riff booms from the AV channels and the camera starts to get ""gritty"" and shakes more then a bad cops episode. Even with this, the flecks of nudity of her body are met with a 2:1 ratio of shots of some mysterious ""onlooker"" who is clearly the directors friend, or something. This dorky slob is the final nail in the casket for the scene - as this dork enjoys Aimee's find physique, we are forced to watch in horror and disugust of what was once a great american institution. Shame on you Penthouse. Shame on all your houses.If you want a good penthouse vid, get the other Lingerie movie."
2,below average,"Well im sorry to say that this video was a stinker.The video quality is just plain bad(It looks like it was shot on 8mm film!)The other bad part is theres only 4 girls in it(3 cheapins'& the lovely Aimee Sweet)And even if your an Aimee Sweet fan the video is still not worth the buy.If your looking for a good penthouse video Id say buy the ""pet of year"" & ""pet of year & friends"" videos because there very good."
2,Not enough you know...,This video is like every other non-playoff video. No spreads or anything. And there are only two scenes that will entice you.The two scenes with Aimee Sweet arent enough to wet my appetite.
1,Bad choice,"There are only 4 girls in this video. You'll fall asleep waiting for anything to happen. When it does, you might not wake up.Don't bother."
2,Definately [not good],"This definately was not good.1)Nothing really followed in chronological order. Girl would get naked, then she'd have their clothes on, then not. Why couldn't they just stay naked?2) One of the models never showed anything but her top. Was she hiding something?I can go on but you get the idea."
2,Decent but not excellent,"The video as far as showing of the Pets is good. However this DVD seems to be shot directly onto tape, not film. The production level looks way to low budget to give good DVD quality."
3,love texture... colors werent exact,"i ordered these to finish a blanket for my 10 year old... the texture is amazing but darn to darn the colors weren't exact.. some were faded & others were bright.. also I only ordered once and got 2 shippments and billed twice... so watch your payment account,.. I got the blanket done and my kiddo loves it.."
5,Excellent story-telling & documentary!,"Liked how the speaking documentaries were interspersed with the re-created scenes. My favorite parts were Wes Studi's as he spoke in the Cherokee language (subtitled in English). It just added authenticism to this work. Also, the fact that different well-known actors were the voices at various parts of the film. Didn't know that James Earl Jones was half Cherokee, and he did a nice job as well. I plan to share my copy with friends and family. Definitely a story Americans should know, especially those of us living in/around Appalachia."
5,Trail of Tears,"It looks like it will be a good book. I really haven't had the time to read this book about the ""Trail of Tears""."
5,Excellent documentary,The movie is well screened and the documentary is vivid and accurate. Wes Studi is remarkable as he narrates in the Cherokee language.
4,Informative video,"This video was an awesome chance to bring the Trail of Tears to life. I've been working on a research project about it, and so far, the research has been cerebral, in a sense. Facts, facts, facts. This video had a nice balance of facts, but also a personal touch, to bring faces to the facts. I really appreciated the easy chronological flow it had to it. It was also very sad to watch. Our nation has a huge scar in its history because of this event, and I think this video was very informative about what happened."
3,Black Native Americans,"I am just now ordering this film and glad to see such good reviews, to see African-Americans playing in it warms my heart as my heritage is native and african american, and i rarely see much mention of the rich history or even mention of this part of history, will return to write a review after seeing the movie. My nickname as a child/youth was pocahontas."
3,movie trail of tears,"Thought this was a movie, not documentary. Disappointed but not sellers fault. We will keep looking for the book we wanted."
3,"Good Quality, a little bit too little action","I really enjoy the three Tivola games we bought for our children. They grow up in a bi lingual home and therefore had fun switching between the different language versions of this game. As you can switch in every place you are, it is really fun to compare how different people say things.Max and Marie go shopping is great, but doesn't have as much of a fun factor as my favorite Tivola game, Max and the haunted castle.It is great to get your kid into how shopping works and buying things as well as having fun with music and learing hand and eye coordination.My little daugther enjoyed playing it when she was as young as 4 years old.And she still likes it now, 3 years later, but of course not that long as back then :) But it is really a good game even for older kids...and the price here is pretty good as well! A steal for that price!"
2,Below Average Software,"The Max-series of software from Tivola is based on a dog-like thing named Max. Virtually every title works the same way... you are provided with a list of things to find (usually about 12) and then you make your way through the rooms or locations until you find everything. The software is decidedly European (written by Germans), and the English version is actually British. The graphics a mediocre and sluggish, even on a fast machine (ie. 2GHz with TNT graphics). Each time you change a room or location, you are prompted (slowly), ""Are you sure..."" As a parent, you will have to 'drive' while the child watches since no child will tolerate the finicky mouse response and slow scene changes. These titles are barely worth the [amount] sale price."
5,One of the Aces' Highest,"I am always leery of live albums because hearing a crowd in the background usually distracts me. But this album came highly recommended by a trusted source, so I took a chance on it and discovered it is possible to make a live album that's really hot. The Aces are a totally unigue band with a sound all their own and these tracks are some of their best numbers. In my mind, there are many genres of music, country, blues, rock, etc. and then there is Aces' music; a superior genre all its own. Here they've recorded perfomances at several different concerts with other great musicians added to the mix, all attended by enthusiastic audiences. When you listen to the album, it's easy to picture the The Ace's soulful lead singer, Russell Smith, having a great time with his songs, his band and his fans. I promise you will never tire of listening to this album because these are great songs delivered by the most talented of musicians with genuine emotion and heartfelt energy."
4,"Great album, iffy recording","This album was my introduction to the Aces, back in the early 80's. I've listened to a lot of their stuff since, but none of it even comes close to this one. They were obviously enjoying making this music, the level of polish in the performance is incredible.The CD is slightly disappointing, in that it is clearly recorded from an album, not the original tapes. Still, it is such a great album that it doesn't kill it. If you're an Aces fan, buy this one!"
2,WHY A CD-R????,"I LOVE THIS GROUP, AND THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ALBUM, BUT THE GROUP SOLD OUT TO CHEAP CD-RS!!! THIS IS MADE ON CR-R!!..BE AWARE THAT THE ACES USED CD-R'S FOR THIS, NOT SILVER CDS FOR ""AMAZING RHYTHM ACES - FULL HOUSE ACES HIGH CD""! THIS REALLY MATTERS TO ME BECAUSE IT IS STILL VERY EXPENSIVE, AND CD-RS DO NOT LAST LIKE PRESSED SILVER CDS, AND THEY SCRATH VERY EASILY! HOW MUCH DID YOU GUYS REALLY SAVE?"
5,Attractive and functional,"If you need compression socks, these will do the job. very sturdy and comfortable. easily hand-washed, and can be worn over another pair for extra compression if necessary. These are attractive. They don't look like support socks. Keeps feet and ankles from retaining water and swelling."
5,Really helped with swelling,I fly between Asia and North America a lot and always experienced a lot of swelling in my feet and ankles. These socks really did help to reduce the swelling on my last trip. I'll purchase again!
1,Yech!,"I wanted to like this product, I really did. But after trying it for two days it's going to be re-assigned to dog shampoo. The smell is overpowering, and REALLY reminds me of the scent of that vacuum powder you put down. I received my product on the outside of the acceptable range, but still within it. The bottles are much smaller than they look in the picture though. Chalk it up to experience."
5,Refreshingly Exquisite,"These gorgeous melodies never forget my heart as I listen to them, even as they are sometimes flung wildly over the edges of tonality. As distinguished from most other contemporary art songs I've heard, these actually compel me to listen to them! They wind through all sorts of terrain: impressionist and expressionist - always remaining truly romantic. My suggestion: buy a good bottle of wine to go with this CD. Open them at the same time."
1,Blah!!!,"If you like the taste of cardboard, you'll love these!!! Fortunately the company allowed me to exchange 11 of the 12 bags for another product."
2,SAME OLD THING,"OTHER THAN ABOUT 15 MINUTES, EVERYTHING ELSE IS STUFF WE HAVE ALL SEEN NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE...JFK, RFK, KING, WHITMAN, MANSON....THE HIGHLITE WOULD HAVE TO BE THE EDMUND KEMPER INTERVIEW, WHICH BY THE WAY YOU CAN FIND ON YOUTUBE....I DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING IT LIKE I FOOLISHLY DID"
5,Tommy Hilfiger Mens Briefs,"Comfortable, yet supportive. Soft with nice fit. Have worn these briefs for years."
1,Never worked,I bought this at Christmastime as a gift. My son tried using it for the first time this spring -- it wouldn't turn on. Total waste of money.
1,Piece of Junk,"It's a good thing this toy is no longer available because it was a total piece of junk---didn't even work coming out of the box. My son was really excited when he saw it (got it for Christmas), and it was a total dud. What a rip off."
1,Rip Off,This never worked. Its a piece of junk. Our 7 year old was so disappointed. Don't waste your money or time on purchasing this item!
2,"Not bad, but cannot replace batteries","This isn't a bad product, but you cannot replace the batteries, which is a big drawback. I would not buy this again."
1,Total scam,"The battery was dead when we opened the package--and the engineers so brilliantly designed it with no way of changing the battery. We purchased this at Kohl's (not Amazon) and the ball never worked--at all, not even once. It is $.50 worth of ""electronics"" stuffed inside a $.25 baseball-like object that cost $30--what a scam!"
3,Sleepless in Louisville,"This case would be a good test for central casting. The author has already cast Nick Nolte as John McGoldrick, one of the lead lawyers for Lilly. Kevin Spacey might be a better pick. Fred McMurray is unfortunately passed away, or he would be a terrific Ed Stopher. Joe Freeman should be played by the guy who is ""Perry White"" on Superman and who was the prosecutor on ""My Cousin Vinny."" Paul Smith shall be played by Snuffy Smith, although he is a fictional character. Nancy Zettler should be played by Roseanne Barr.Judge Potter could be played by ""Mister Hart"" from Paper Chase, or maybe Jack Nicholson, in a stretch. (Think The Shining)The book fails to mention the contributions of many young associates toiling in and around the courtroom."
5,Valette-Valette. The best in language learning,"I have to say this is the most practical guide to learning any language. I used this textbook throughout my entire high school career and found it extremely valuable. It was so good that I enrolled in the Spanish course throughout high school and earned top marks in both languages. Not only have I retained most of the information I learned (it's now going on 15 years)but I have also been successful and communication with most people in both French and Spanish. I wish that Valette-Valette had made other language courses using their set-up. I highly recommend them to amyone interested in learning in a language. If they make a text for learning Icelandic, I will be willing to pay top dollar. I am now hunting for copies of both the French and Spanish courses as I plan to teach both lanugages using these texts. Merci! and Gracias!"
1,WARNING!,"This DVD DOES NOT show you how to perform an FMEA. It is simply a brief look at one company's/engineer's experience with using an FMEA. You are better off buying an FMEA handbook for $5. As an experienced FMEA practitioner, I get more valuable info out of a $5 hand book than this $100+ DVD."
1,Absolutely dumbfounded - terrible terrible video quality,"This DVD is awful. The video quality is terrible. Anytime anything moves, huge blocky artifacts appear on screen. The entire documentary looks like it was shot on a CELL PHONE CAMERA and then burned onto DVD. I'm not joking - it's that bad.I wasn't hoping for anything great. Just some nice Korean footage I could show with the volume off - but the video quality is so atrocious that I can't even use it for that.Save your money and stay away from this DVD."
4,"Informative, but...","The locations, scenery, history and information are good, however, if you travel to Korea, don't make the mistake of copying the horrible pronunciations used in this video. This isn't the first time I have noticed that the British seem to refuse to learn how to properly pronounce anything foreign. One would think that if you are making a travel video about another country, you would do them the honor of a little research. I took one star off my recommendation just for that."
2,Hearing Impaired? Don't buy if you need captions during DVD playback.,"If you're hearing impaired and NEED to be able to view closed captions (CC) during DVD playback, keep looking. Though Magnavox insists this unit can do this, it cannot. It can, of course, play back subtitles if the DVD has them encoded, and it can display CC during television signal playback, but for some reason it cannot show captions (again, CC is a different animal than subtitles) that are encoded on a disc.If, however, you don't have a hearing disability or do not need the captions during disc playback, it's not a bad set. The picture is good (but not great) during disc playback and the sound is good, with a very feature-laden remote. If it had caption playback ability, though, I'd probably not move it above 3 stars as the viewing angle is pretty direct. Overall, a decent set for a kitchen or dorm room."
2,DVD player poor quality,"Bought one from Target. Try every type of DVDs (retail store bought, region 1, yadda yadda, I'm not stupid), none worked.After a few minutes of research online, it seems like these units are poorly made (the DVD portion anyway) Returned the next day. Did not bother trying another one, why waste my time and gas money."
4,Just what you need for your Masterbuilt fryer,"If you have theMasterbuilt Propane Turkey FryerThis is just what you need to turn your turkey fryer into an all-purpose fryer and crap boiling pot. The price seems a little steep, but considering the low price of the fryer I guess they have to make up the money somewhere. Four stars because of the high price, otherwise it is perfect."
3,Lora Leigh Fan,"I only bought this book for the short story by Lora Leigh that completes the series for the August brothers. It was great and I would give her story a 5.The other stories were okay but I would not have bought this book if Lora Leigh was not in it. I would suggest that you buy it if you are looking for a specific author. If not, I would pass on it."
4,August Heat - last of the August Men series,"I only bought this to finish off the August Men series and I'm glad I did. It was good closure and was still hot to read! I only wish that the author had dedicated an entire book to end the series and not a short story.You should read the series in order Marly's Choice, Sara's Seduction, and Heather's Gift before you read August Heat as it will not make much sense regarding the characters and what they have endured to get to where they are.Lora Leigh sure knows how to write erotic romance!"
3,August Men Finale,"Like most of the other reviewers, I bought this anthology for the August Men finale. I loved it, just wish it had been a little longer. The rest of the stories were also just too short to really get my attention. I've read books by several of the other authors, but these short stories are just not long enough to really show off their good stuff."
5,My muscle retention is good...,"thanks to this product. I sometimes buy another brand for convenience, but if you are on a budget, I'm sure this will work fine. I noticed no degradation of muscle mass.I'm on a special high protein diet, so I like taking this once in the morning, just for good measure. I can tell my density is up too; because I don't float as well in the pool during exercise. This is a good indication that either muscle mass is expanding, or the fat cells are taking on water before shrinking away to hibernate(for lack of a better term), or both. I vote both in my instance.I've lost over 100 lbs, so far, and supplements like this are essential in my opinion. I picked the tartrate because a well known scientist that actually studied nutrition, discovered this is an essential nutrient. Dr. N.V. Perricone is pretty well know as a legitimate source for information."
3,History of the Camera would be a better title.,"This book is part of a series one we will probably buy all of they are well written. Like I said in the title though, it's more of a History of the camera and the people that used them over time and how that's changes. Nice 4 page pullout in the middle.However, it's not a book with picutres of the guts of the camrea like I thought it would be. I thought it would be more about ""how it works"" and ""how the parts have changed"" and gotten smaller, that it is NOT!It's well done, there is alot more reading, then I thought there would be. This is a book for an avid reader, someone doing a report, teaching a class, or a student of the camera/film industry, or someone wanting to know more about the ""individualS"" (not nessecarily the actual inventor) that brought this invention to the world and it's people. It's more a High School level read then it is for upper elementary (which I bought it for)."
5,Great episode!,"The ... Voyager equivalent to this episode is ""Non Sequitor"". This episode, unlike ""Non Sequitor"", is excellent. Through this episode we get to see how life could have been different for Worf, with many different possibilities. Looking back now, I don't know why the Worf-Troi romance ever went on -- I think Troi and Riker are meant for each other, but that doesn't wreck this excellent episode at all!"
5,interesting,the fact its changing from one alternate realty to another is an interesting plot in itself. It's an episode you can watch over and over.
1,Poorly edited,This book is poorly written and poorly edited. A good quality internet search could garner the same information in a better quality format.
1,Book about testosterone replacement therapy,"The book is in the main about the author's views on testosterone replacement therapy, but just about mentions vasectomy in passing. It's fair to say that the vasectomy information reviewed is highly selective, in the main 15 plus years old, and contradicted by much newer and much better research. What information on vasectomy there is just so happens to fit in with the author's view on testosterone replacement therapy, which he just happens to practice. Coincidence???"
5,Offers a depth of coverage not seen in more general titles,"CITIES OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA: A HISTORICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA is a top pick for the high school to college-level collection where courses in Middle Eastern or North Africa are given. A full overview of each city's historical path offers a depth of coverage not seen in more general titles, examining everything from local politics to local culture and blending in debates and controversies on every issue affecting each city. Over fifteen academic contributors from around the world lend insights to an outstanding reference."
5,KYB 343290 GR-2 Rear Shock,"The KYB GR-2 provides an excellent ride on my vehicle. Slightly stiffer than oem rear shock, the ride is slightly harsher but the handling and cornering has improved compared to the original manufacturer's shocks. Installation was straight forward and required less than 15 minutes per side.KYB 343290 GR-2 Shock"
2,Geordi defies Picard's orders!,"After learning that his mother may be alive on another starship, Geordi uses a risky interface procedure to try and contact his mother. But when his life is in danger, he finds no sign of her and Picard orders him not to interface with that ship's computer. However, Geordi defies and and Data helps Geordi interface again, where he fially finds his mother. But is his mother actually there?"
2,Indiana Jones and the inferior plot.,"To enjoy this book one has far beyond willing suspension of disbelief. The plot would have made a so-so science-fiction novel, but as an Indiana Jones book it falls short of the mark. I liked most of the other books that I've read in this series, but in this one I kept hoping I would come to the part where Indy was conked on the head at Easter Island and was just dreaming this whole awful fantasy . . ."
4,"Good plot,good action,but a little outlandish","I just finished reading this book today.It was one of the most exotic and exicting Indiana Jones books.But it is rather outlandish.It's almost like Indy traveling to another planet and looking for a lost artifact(what would you think of such a book?slightly silly?Yes.)My favorite Indy book is still ""The Unicorn's Legacy"".The best scene is when Maleiwa(big baddie) and Indy fight for the alicorn on the Statue of Liberty and...what ya lookin' at me for?I'm not telling you the end!"
2,Way too outlandish,"Well it seems that Rob MacGregor has done it again. The whole plot of this book was based on a portal and a world that inside ours. Now this may be a cool idea, but it IN NO WAY fits the Indy storyline. I mean, for cry'in out loud, this story is way too outlandish for Indy. If you disagree you have never seen the movies. Rob was doing well until he started writing stuff like this in his Indy books."
2,New Age theories tedious,"Too much fantasy and not enough reality. The Merlin/Appllo relationship is not explained in MacGregor's last book. In fact, I thought MacGregor was anxious to wrap up his commitment to the series. The weakest book from all three authors."
1,The WORST of the series,I must agree with the reader in Lighthouse Point. This is the WORST of the Indiana Jones series. Indiana visits Toontown and battles cartoon monsters...wheres the Grimace?...Where's theTasmanian Devil?...Pegleg Pete...?
3,Insides stuck together at some places,"It was all good when I started putting pictures into the 4""x6"" plastic pockets. But as I got near the middle 2/3 of the book, the plastic pockets would stick to the backing so I'd have to unstick it (ripping the edges a little) and it would also leave ugly marks on the plastic that is above the photo. My only complaint. Perhaps only my photo album is like that and not all others since it may have been caused by heat melting or something."
3,Album as pictured is misleading,"The album is fine in and of itself, though the blue lettering and memo area is a little weird. I think black or no lettering and pattern on the pages would have been better. But my issue with the albums is, as pictured it looks like it can hold larger then 4x6 pictures vertically on pages. Once I received the item is was made clear that this album holds only 4x6 images and nothing larger. Not what my MIL had asked for. This was supposed to be a gift and now I have to return the item and hope I have time to find something that will work for what she wants. Hopefully I will have no problem with the return. Jury is still out on that one. But I will update when the return and been processed.-Update- Return was processed today. No problems there."
3,Decent and affordable,"I like the green color, the album itself is decent. I do have a few complaints.. on the bottom of the book some of the pages came bent, it looked like someone has used it previously but I doubt that's the case. The pages hold 2 4x6's per page with a little spot on the inside to write a note. In some of the pockets the plastic was stuck to the page so it was tough to get some of the pictures in. Overall, I'm not complaining since it was cheap. This album is just ok."
3,Good for a Basic Photo Album,"The item was exactly as I expected - no bells or whistles. I just wanted something inexpensive, but sturdy and that is the product I got."
4,Cute book,"It comes in a plastic sleeve that reminds me of the plastic grandmas put on their furniture. I kinda want to take it off but I don't want the book to get dirty. There is a section for you to write about the photo on the side of the sleeves. I wish it didn't say ""MEMO"" because it sounds very officey.I love the window on the cover. I drew a picture of me, my boyfriend and his daughter and put it there. It's a simple way to personalize it. The window is 3x3 inches so make sure your that your image is 3x3 (so nothing gets cut off) but the paper you slide in should be the size of the paper that comes with the book. I used regular printer paper so I kept the paper the book comes with under my picture so it could slide in easily."
5,great!,"nice heavy durable big photo album. wasnt enough for me, i need to buy more, absolutely love it! highly recommended"
4,Good product,"I make a lot of my own greeting cards and I always had the problem of not being able to print to the edge. Now the problem is solved. It also helps when your greeting card program is not quite compatible with your printer. You can print over onto the perforations a little and still have a perfect card.I have only two minor complaints.1. The card stock is not quite as heavy I would prefer, especially if using a lot of photos. Still, if you play with your printer settings a little you can do quite well.2. It is a little difficult to see and tear the card at the perforations. After tearing, there were a lot of jagged edges which you had to smooth.Overall, it is a great product and the results are worth the minor difficulties."
3,Read this before you buy!,"I wish to say first of all that I am a great advocate of the superlearning techniques, but I have to say that this audio is basically just the same old stuff regurgitated using different examples! By all means, learn about the technique and use it, but i would recommend the ""Superlearning"" book or the boxed set. This tape is enjoyable to listen to, but it has virtually nothing new. In fact i can say that, having read several books by te authors which are good, I have to say, I found just ONE piece of new and useful information on this cassette. The fact that I cannot recall it now while writing this review probably demonstrates that it was nothing so life-changing after all! For newcomers, it does give an overview of the technique which could probably enable you to put it to use (which is why I rate it as a 3) but if you are superlearning initiated already, you have nothing to buy this tape for!"
5,Very well indexed,"College was over 10 years ago for me but this useful little hardcover has remained a fixture on my desk through law school and several jobs.I'm not one of Dr. Perrin's students, and I really have no clue about his qualifications beyond writing this book, but I can definitely vouch for its usefulness. It's useful for several reasons. It's clear, it's concise, and it's indexed well. Grammar tends not to suffer the fluid trends of popular fancy, so my circa 1989 second edition is still an essential in my writing arsenal - but I would like to see an update in my lifetime."
1,Shill reviews,"These reviews appear to be all shill reviews except for maybe one. They're mostly from Florida, probably where the author lives, and they're all within a month or so of each other. Disappointing."
5,very nice music,"just great cd , love the words to the songs and music is nice not country but not rock either"
5,SEXY READ!,"As an avid follower of this anthology, I was very pleased to find this collection. Though the cover featured on this webpage is much better than the actual cover of the book, the contents are steaming with diversity and erotica. Highlights include Michael Lassell, Scott O' Hara, Justin Chin, Emanuel Xavier, and Simon Sheppard. Make sure you have a hand towel available after each short story . . . there's something for everyone here."
2,Harder to use than the other types,"For a reason that completely eludes me, the manufacturer decided to go against the mainstream and glue the flaps on the inside of the envelope. All other brands are glued on the outside. The main disadvantage is that CDs are harder to insert into the envelopes: they tend to get stuck between the imperfectly glued flaps and the back of the envelope. This design also offers less protection to the CD, as the flaps rub harder against it when sliding it in or out, and may even scratch it a bit. Other than that, the envelopes are okay, but the only reason why you'd buy these instead of the cheaper Fellowes product is the shipping cost."
5,Afordable way to protect your CD's,"The Burlington CD Envelopes are a great and afordable way to store and protect your cd's cd-r's from dust, scratches etc. I recently bought these for my cd-r's I make. I will purchase more in the furture also!"
3,good,package came on time and was what was expected so I am happy with the transaction and have been using the product
4,"Good price, no real complaints","Decent, fairly priced, and do what they need to. I only gave 4 stars because I wished they had another flap on the back to help secure the main flap shut. Still, pretty decent all-around."
2,Clearly written by a bookkeeper,"I wanted to like this book. But it was far too simplistic in areas, then it introduces new term without explanation in others. Or it over-explains the obvious, then cites Sample charts that are comprised of mostly unexplained entries.I have the impression that the author forgot who the audience was at times. There were chasms of understanding to leap. If I have to google introduced terms while reading an entry level book, or introductory text, then I have the wrong book in my hands.My copy of 'Where Did the Money Go' is on the way. Maybe I'll have an easier time of it with that one."
3,Good Basic book for Beginners,"This book provides a simple explanation of double entry accounting for small business. For a beginning bookeeper or a non-financial manager, it does a good job."
5,Essential Read!!,This book really helped me set up my books properly. I had really made a mess of them up until now. It also teaches me the lingo of accounting so I don't feel like such an idiot talking to my accountant!
2,An Uncustomary Review,"Tagging along to the local bookstore with a fellow bookworm, I found myself mildly mesmerized by the sci-fi/fantasy books. I don't normally peruse these shelves, so you can understand my confusion when titles started becoming titillating. I wasn't planning on adding to my personal library but as my eyes glided from spine to colorful spine, I came across this meaty text. I like a challenge. I picked it up and read the back cover. It spoke of a superior race living on the planet after most humans became extinct. Who wouldn't want to have a peak at the new and improved Human 2.0?To read the complete review visit The Uncustomary Book Review."
4,A Great Read!!!,"This was a wonderful story. The characters, the plot and the pace are perfect.The first book was the strongest, but comes to a rather sudden halt. The second book was outstanding. The 3rd book is the weakest of the 3, but if you stick it out to the end all of the plot lines and threads left lying about are tied together.I wish for a 4th book, as more could be explored with these characters. The rituals, androgynous characters, and striking writing make this hard to put down. The best fantasy book I have read since ""Lord of the Rings""."
1,The Man Show,"I seem to be in the minority here, but I couldn't get beyond page 75 in this story, which struck me as a gay male fantasy of a world where women are no longer necessary. These hermaphroditic Wraeththu are clearly men, they evolve from men and act and think like men, as far as I can see. Once I figured out that much, I just couldn't be bothered to read the remaining hundreds of pages. Give me a good feminist sci-fi gender bender any time."
3,"Amazing, Stupendous, Incredibly....","mediocre. I bought this tome hoping to read not only a great story but gain a few insights on gender and androgyny. Sadly, the writing is so simplistic, that one never really feels anything for the characters. The amazing transformation that some of them go through is rather two dimensional. The three stories that make up the book are quite simple, and for the most part lack suspense or an intriguing plot. The last story, ""The Fulfillments of Fate and Desire"" is the best of the lot; but even it suffers from a ""tacked on"" ending.The subject matter could have made for a fascinating book, but it seems that the author's inspiration ended there."
1,couldn't get throught the first book,"it took me two years of regular attempts at the behest of a good friend to get through the first 2/3 of the first book. it was not worth it.interesting concepts, horribly written."
4,An entire world brought to life,Storm is definetely and excellent writer and has the talent to make you present in the place that the characters experiences are happening. While I think that this collection is a bit flawed she is definetely continuosly evolving as a writer and will bring us many great fantasy works over the years.
1,Pass / Fail Book for the Reader,"I am a voracious reader and I rarely not finish a book if I pick it up.This one I bought because I needed something to read on a trans pacific flight from SFO to Narita Airport in Japan.I read approx. just under half and put it down without having once empathized or identified with anyone in the story. I still had about nine hours to go on the flight and didn't have anything else to read. I could not muster up the wherewithal to keep reading.I have read some of the other reviews and I agree that this is strictly a pass/fail book for the reader. If you like it, great! If you don't, read something else.I choose to read something else."
3,Suliminal Program,The music used is not obnoxious. The CD last for about a half hour. I've used it a couple of times. I'm not sure subliminal programs work. But I'm going to check it out.
3,Worth the effort,"I really loved ""Jackie by Josie"" so looked forward to reading this book. I found the two to be entirely different, and so it took me awhile to get through the first part of it. I'm glad I did. I never read any of F. Scott Fitzgerald, shockingly, really, but I found the history/fiction angle to be really kind of intriguing and I will now go and read Fitzgerald's books.At first you don't like the protagonist very much, and when I was in publishing years ago, I was taught that if you don't like the main characters, you don't care about the story. But you do come to care about Ginevra. I'd have liked to see the character developed more, but she does grow and change and becomes after a time humorously self-deprecating.If you hang in there, you'll be glad you did. I look forward to more books from this author."
1,1 month to receive,I ordered the book on September 8 and received it October 6. Unbelievable that a shipment could take a month to arrive.
3,adds a lot of weight to the bird feeder plus the squirrels seemed to familiar with it,"This baffle is very nice as far as it's size and construction. However, it adds a lot of weight to the bird feeder since it is not supported by its own hanger but rather by the top of the bird feeder. As soon as I put the baffle on, a squirrel looked up at it and then immediately climbed the shepherd's hook and sat on top of the baffle. He didn't make it down to the bird feeder itself. However, I never had a squirrel even climb up the shepherd's hood before. He seemed to be very familiar with baffles. I mostly purchased the baffle to keep the birdseed dry during the rainy season. In the end, I decided to take the baffle down and attach an umbrella to the top of the shepherd's hook with a bungee cord. No more squirrel climbing the pole and the seed stays dry. A much cheaper solution."
2,Almost...,"Was excited to see this product for $0.99 for a while, but alas, after ordering I was informed it was a web error. I thought I was getting a lifetime supply of wire. But its back to its overpriced Aluminum Clad Copper wire self... :("
5,"Nice service, great product.","This is a great product, and the price is right. Being able to buy them from Amazon is a real plus."
2,Valuable mostly as an early Lollobrigida film,"This movie is not really much as a biography of Enrico Caruso; viewers looking for a biopic might be better advised to seek out the one with Mario Lanza and Ann Blyth. Its main interest lies in the fact that it's one of Gina Lollobrigida's earlier performances; she's stunning, as always, as the love interest."
2,Too Sketchy and Unrealistic,"A sketchy biography only of this greatest tenor of all times.It began with the boy singing in the street. He also sang in the church choir too etc. It seems that it was shot somewhere in a small village in Tuscany with some reality.Only Caruso's funeral was true. But the DVD comes with quite a bonus of a few of Caruso's arias. The sound as a whole is not bad at all. But there is not much drama in the movie, and as a whole, it isn't really a success. If you have one or two of this master's CD, you might as well avoid it."
1,THIS IS NOT A DVD!,THIS SET CONSISTS OF 2 CD'S AND A BONUS DVD THAT IS 10 MINUTES LONG! AMAZON ADVERTISED IT AS A DVD SET. IT IS NOT A FULL DVD
2,Not what I thought I was buying!,I was looking for a Tony Robbins DVD for a more visual experience than the tapes alone. I love Tony's work however this DVD was extremely disappointing and was really nothing more than a sales pitch for his seminars.
3,"Good Henley, Good Price","This is a decent henley....Substantial, beefy fabric, but the feel is rather rough. It's sold primarily as workwear and it is probably best in that type of application. It's just barely classy enough for casual use. The fit is as pictured, with a good length to the body and the sleeves."
2,Way too long,This shirt was way too long to be worn. Can't tuck it in either cause it's too long. Maybe if I was really tall. Maybe if I wore a skirt and tucked it in...
1,dissatisfied with the product received,"make a purchase of a Columbia sweatshirt that appears first and instead sent a sand-colored short sleeve shirt which does not match the requested product, plus the product was shipped to another country, what is the PROSEDE now. this seems a lack of Respo to the client, which resulted negative experience so this purchase.I feel cheated as a customer of amazon"
4,well made,"The shirt is very well made, much better quality than the other Henley style shirts I've purchased. I didn't much care for the rather bold Carhartt label on the front, it's a bit much. The shirt size does run a bit big so if you're in between sizes you might be able to get by with the next size down."
5,Just What I Ordered.,"Fine quality no defects. Have been wearing this brand for 10 years now and they are still going strong, Thank You"
4,"Good shirt, runs big",The shirt is very solid and I expect it will last for years. I am a XXL in almost every shirt I own so that's what I ordered. My wife had a good chuckle when I tried it on. It's quite large and I'm sure it won't shrink down to normal size but we'll see...
5,love the work dry,My husband wears these shirts on the farm and to work. The shirts do not fade. They keep my husband cool and dry.These shirts are his all time favorites. thank you carhartt.
5,Great Shirts,I have purchased four of these shirts recently and I am very happy with them. They are well made and look great. I plan on buying a few more of them.
3,Sized to BIG,Shirts seem to be nice and well made. My problem is the size. The shirts had to be returned because they were a size large. BEWARE AND ORDER A SIZE SMALLER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR.
3,Two sizes too large,Shirt quality seems fine but the sizing is irregular. If you normally wear a large you should probably order a medium or possibly a small depending on how you prefer your shirts to fit.
3,Shirt i got was the shirt ordered,"However... Please if your going to order, remember sizes vary significantly. XL which is what i usually wear (and im not a big guy) was huge and could probably be used for a tent on my deer lease property. Although it worked out well, gave it to my dad because the price was right and the order was completed accurately. Too much of a pain to return it anyway."
4,great,Nice shirt and nice fit material is a bit stiff but you get used to it. I actually got 2 and i am satisfied with it
4,"Well made with heavy SCRATCHY cotton, and LARGE","Thanks to the many other reviewers I ordered 1 SIZE SMALLER and it fits well. Well made of THICK 100% cotton.The material feels a SCRATCHY until it's been washed many times even then it's a bit rough. If this is an outer shirt, no problem."
4,It's great material,"Ok. So I bought these shirts, and they feel good, they are a great fit and I don't sweat in them and the thing I like the most is that when I do sweat because of hard work, I don't smell like dry sweat or anything. so I would most definitely recomend this Carhart shirts to anybody."
3,Why do I always order Carhartt???,When I have such bad luck with it. Bottomline: good fit; inferior fabric. Worn two times washed w/dark clothes and there are several small bleached spots.
5,Comfortable,"This was purchased as casual wear and not as a work uniform. It looks nice, is comfortable and is reasonably priced. Since the shirt was intended for casual wear, I removed the pocket tag, before washing, in about two minutes using pointed scissors. I'm very happy with my purchase. P.S. The item in the photo supplied by Amazon is NOT the item I purchased. I purchased the Carhartt Henley Shirt in port (Deep red)."
5,Great shirts,"My husband loves the weight, fit and comfort of these shirts, they also wash up nicely. Hard to beat Carhartt."
5,Well Constructed + Heavy Material,"Really like the Henley collarless style. These Carhartt are well made and rugged. Breast pocket and long tail length a plus. I already owned several of the long sleeve version and bought (5) of the short sleeve. Great casual wear and ""dressier"" than a T-Shirt."
4,Solid Value,"A good buy. This is a well made product and it shows. The price was not too shabby, either. 4 Stars!"
4,Henley Shirt,"This shirt looks very good. The color is very vibrant. My husband hasn't worn it yet, so I don't have any comments yet."
2,Repellent attitudes,"As a Star Trek story, this is standard fare, combining environmental disaster, conflict between characters, a holodeck problem, and a Prime Directive dilemma. Yes, it's well made and reasonably well-written. But it lacks emotional depth, and more was needed to explain Nikolai's actions and the difficult relationship between him and Worf. And I just don't believe that anyone could transport all those people into the holodeck with no-one noticing.I've taken one star off because of the repellent atttitudes the crew of the Enterprise display in this episode. They will not lift a finger to intervene and save the Boraalans, which they could easily do without the Boraalans ever noticing. There seems to be no place for compassion or mercy in their world, as they flatter themselves that they are acting with nobler aims than is Nikolai. Picard's posturing was particularly annoying. Where would he and his crew be if Q had not shown them some mercy in ""Q-Who""?"
3,In Ms. Mason's comfort zone,"Connie Mason's second installment to her Rogue series aspires to be no more than an entertaining caper that will gratify her league of fans. A flat-out predictable plot involving Earl of Braxton, Ramsey Dunsmere who is recruited back to the Foreign Offices to seduce his estranged wife, daughter to an Egyptian archaeologist Phoebe Thompson serves as the platform for plenty of hot sizzling interludes. He is to reclaim back an amulet which is crucial to the diplomatic relations between Egypt and England. Ms. Mason's mastery at weaving passion and tension salvages this otherwise prolonged romance and the frustration from their unresolved conflicts on trust and commitments. It is definitely a book in Ms. Mason's comfort zone - safe but none too surprising."
4,Certainly steamy enough!!,"Wow this one was to die for in the bedroom - and almost every other room too!! Phoebe and Ram had a past that had for once left the man the rejected one - which sent Ram into a life of debauchery and he wanted nothing to do with Phoebe ever again. So he finds himself by order of the Crown forced back into her life. Thinking of course that he will be able to keep his lust in check, well that lasted about one day. This couple was hot and the mystery surrounding the amulet made for a good backdrop to unravelling their feelings and possibly learning to trust one another. For this couples biggest problem was lack of trust. My only reservation on 5 stars would be the reason Phoebe left him 4 years earlier- David Phillips just came off to much as a scoundrel to ever seem to be able to influence Phoebe to leaving the man she loved. But alls well that ends well and this ended quite well - looking forward to Luc 's story now - what will London women do without the 3 Rogues??"
5,good read,Liked the book very much but not happy that the first book in the series is unavailable in kindle form.
3,An okay read but seem to easy,"Ramsey Dunsmore,The Earl of Braxon served the forgein office durning the war. When news come that a priceless egyptian artifact is missing the prime suspect are Sir Andrew Thompson and his daughter Phoebe, Ramsey's wife. Ramsey see this a chance to get back her for leaving him four years ago.""Seduced by a Rogue"" is second book in Connie Mason's ""Rouge series"" and while some scenes were very sexy, the overall plot was a very easy read and not much depth to it. The villian was clear to by chapter four and that did take away from the overall story."
5,Simple enough for me!,"This atlas allows me to develop some geography and map concepts that are often difficult for children. The few words and easy to ""read"" illustrations are going to be a great boon to students who are having difficulty with understanding concepts such as continents, etc."
5,another winner,this belt really does work. washing it in the washer doesn't hurt it either. make sure you don't put it in the dryer.
3,Pretty good,"I had to buy this book for a class I'm taking, and while I wouldn't buy it as a novel to read (hence the 3 stars and not 5), and I'm not much of a reader either, I think that it's definitely a very good book for a class or for people who are avid readers."
3,Jason's legacy,"If you are looking for juicy details, behind the scenes gossip and explanations of the films...forget it. The author basically goes through the motion of relating each films' conception, it's production time and the business it did at the box office. There are a few quotes from cast members and Sean S. Cunningham but nothing that a fan would not know. For parts I to IV he takes up to three chapters to relate the history of the films from inception to release date; later, he only devotes one chapter to each film and only gives Freddie Vs Jason two. It got pretty repetitive afterwards and though it was an interesting read at times it's nothing that you need to read twice. The coffee table book Crystal Lake memories shows more promise and I received a copy during the Christmas holidays. I can't wait to begin that one. The pictures alone are breath taking. I recommend buying the coffee table book and leaving this one alone; it truly isn't that riveting."
5,First-Rate Book,"First, I have to take offense with review by previous reviewer. I bought this book from Amazon and I found this book to be one of the most detailed and meticulously-researched books I've read on a film series. The book has the kind of anecdotes and details that make you wonder how the author ever found out this stuff. The book begins by tracing the humble beginnings of the Friday the 13th franchise and it's fascinating to see how a group of low budget filmmakers created something that turned into a massive franchise. My only complaint about the book, which is excellent, is the small print on the pages, but that's okay since there's alot of text. I also happen to think that Jason X is the best of the Friday the 13th sequels."
1,Porgy & Bess original soundtrack,"It was awful! The reproduction of the music was grainy, scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to."
1,want original soundtrack from '50s,"I have not hear this version. I am trying the find the movie soundtrack from the '50s. Sammy Davis, Jr. played Sportin' Life. I have worn out two albums over the years. Does this come on a CD? Can I obtain a copy of a DVD or VCR tape of the original movie? Please let me know if you have any information in the matter.Thank you."
2,Far and away my favorite version,"Porgy and Bess was originally staged as musical theater, with a tough schedule; and concessions were made to preserve the perfomers' voices. The concessions, (cuts mostly) kept it completely unpretentious. And of course it was under Gershwin's supervision. I find it much more satisfying than the more ""grandly operatic"" versions; and Todd Duncan is unequaled. The finale when Porgy sets out in his goat cart to find Bess is a heartbreaker, unequaled by any other version.Sound is better than the badly remastered MCA CD of the early 80's (?).EDIT: I used mouse wheel without reclicking, and rolled the stars choice down. IT SHOULD BE FIVE STARS."
5,An Original Version of America's Greatest Opera,"If you love great opera, little can compare to 'Pory and Bess'. By far the only great American opera, it contains a plethora of hits. ""Summertime"", redone by Janis Joplin, ""I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'"", ""My Man's Gone Now"" and many others are considered some of the best songs and ballads ever written. The sound quality, since this was recorded circa 1930, is at times less than stellar, but it in no way detracts from the overall impact of this opera."
3,Porgy & Bess CD,"This CD is OK for those who are not really familiar with thewhole opera and story, who want to hear an overview of the mostpopular songs."
3,It's Okay,"My Bloody Roomates is the third installment in a four part Korean horror series. The movie comes very close to being excellent, but there are some plot holes that give the movie some problems. But it's still one of the better installments in the Korean horror series."
2,Weak photography and mostly unattractive women,I was thoroughly unimpressed with the quality of the photography in this book. It seemed fairly lifeless to me. It didn't help that the women in general are not attractive. Even the paper quality of the pages seemed to make the photos even more dull. This ones going to be returned.
4,Her Debut Album Debuts!,"Wynnona is fabulous. Her voice is melodic and charming. This CD introduces the country flair and energy she has with a lot of grace and country energy.Every song tells a story and does it with a lot of heart. If you like the JUDDS, you should have this one too. A must for every fan. Her ""Collection"" is my favorite! Buy it!"
3,Not What I Was Expecting....,"I couldn't wait for this first solo release of Wynonna's to come out. I had been a huge Judd fan since ""Had a Dream"" first graced the charts in the 80's. I knew Wy was capable of so much more than what she was doing with the Judds. So, when this release came out, I was expecting her to burst onto the scene with an artistic bang. But, she didn't. I like all the singles, especially ""No One Else on Earth"", but to me, the whole disc is very bland. When her second release, ""Tell Me Why"", came out, I said, ""Now, THIS is what I was expecting on her first solo release!"" While I'm very glad that this debut release was a big hit for her and sold over 5 million copies, I really was expecting more. If you liked this release, I highly recommend ""Tell Me Why"", which showcases the artistry and diversity that I was expecting with this release."
5,best I've read of a country autobiography since Naomi's book,I like the way the author expresses how Wynonna and Naomi never gave up on their dream! It's very inspiring to a young girl in her teens and it teaches us to never give up on your dreams!! END
4,Too bad that Pure Country bulldozed this one's potential,"Like has been said before, it's unfortunate that this solid album immediately preceded George's most popular one, Pure. Only two songs were released from it. Several potential singles did not get the chance they deserved.The first four songs are impressive. You're Right and Holding are great contrasts in tempo, with both containing great choruses and melodies. Gone As a Girl is about as catchy as a single can get, and So Much does a great job in lookng at a relationship from a different perspective. Other highlights include It's Alright With Me, which is a solid rocker, and I love the ""Throw another log..."" line. Wonderland is not bad, but a little too much fluff.The weakest songs are probably Here We Go and All of Me. They are both missing the extra texture that other ballads of George have."
3,"Good, not Great Strait","If you had to put all Strait's discs in order of quality this one would decidedly go in the bottom third but that doesn't mean there isn't good material. ""Gone as a Girl Can Get"" was a great single, and ""So Much Like My Dad"" is practically worth the cost of the cd alone. ""Trains Make Me Lonesome"" is one of his few bad songs, and some of the others are more generic than we expect from Strait."
5,Pandora,"One of the best vocalist trio on the planet! The harmony coming out of these three beautiful ladies is just amazing. The DVD sounds great, the look great and the sing for a very long time. This DVD is a must if you like harmonious vocals.The stage is not all that but this one is not about the stage or the lighting, this one is about the vocals. Great sound on the DVD! Great picture quality, a must have!Que buenas voces! Pandora en todo su apogeo, el sonido es de maravilla y ellas tan hermosas como siempre. Sus voces angelicales cantando una lista de exitos que parece nunca acabar. Compren el DVD, no se arrepentiran."
5,Not bad.,Not bad for what it is. Don't pay full price of course. I shortened and reterminated mine with spades and bananas. The Z3's are much better if you can find them cheap.
4,"Shocking Beginning, but overall good Episode","We TNG fans are frightened when Troi makes a suprising revelation at the start. Picard is also undercover as the rogue ""Galen."" We also see Koral, the tallest Klingon in the history of Star Trek. He is played by James Worthy, former NBA Forward from the Lakers. So all those Sports/Star Trek fans, this is an episode for you. I rather liked this episode because two-parters always have good storylines, and this was no exception. The search for this ancient Vulcan relic ends with a bang. I would recommend this to any ST fans for it's great storyline and true TNG feeling!"
5,very pleased,This book is so much fun even just to look through and instructions are well done. I would recommend this to all knitters.
1,Fogless mirror taht fogs up!,Ditto on the last review. Our began fogging up within 2-3 months and is completely worthless now. That's $40 lost as I didn't save the receipt and bought it elsewhere. Save your money!
2,Not Worth $40,"I bought this item for my husband for Christmas last year and he didn't like it. The mirror fogged up after a month, in spite of the fact that we used the mirror cleaner they included with the mirror."
1,no such thing,"My experience with this mirror is the same as the others here who have written a review. It fogs up. It is also difficult to adhere on some surfaces, like bathroom tiles. I ended up using a superglue in addition to what comes with the item, which is some two sided tape adhesive and suction cups."
2,"Good start, quick failure","The clock feature failed almost immediately. The fogless-ness of the mirror didn't last much longer. It quickly developed a film that won't come off, and fogs up as quickly as your run-of-the-mill bathroom mirror. The ""solution"" they sell doesn't do a thing."
1,"Ignore that ""fogless"" part","Same as all the other reviews. After about three showers it starts to fog up. Cleaning the mirror surface does not help. The light only stays on for five minutes at a time, but sometimes the button gets stuck down and it stays on indefinitely, running down the batteries."
3,OK but look around,First: I purchased a similar product at Sharper Image and it had much better lighting - it was spread around vs. pinpoint with this model. The mirror went bad after 6 months - but as luck would have it SI dropped the item and thus no replacement parts (thanks guys). The offered up this one as a replacement. The mirror is fine - they all start to fog up regardless of claims - but I do not care for the light. Looking to replace with another and (hopefully) better lit one.
3,Great at first...,"The fogless mirror worked at first, but after a few months it wasn't so fogless anymore. The light works great though!"
2,Works for few months,"I have had this mirror for over a year now. It works well for first few months but, later, it starts to fog. Now, it is like any ordinary mirror and serves me more as a razor holder than a fog-less mirror. Also, additional source of light is always needed."
1,so bad,bought it and it worked for like a month. now it just sits in my room doing nothing. i am going to look for the company information and try to get my money back. if you are going to get a shower mirror pay a little more and get quality.
2,Broken,"The clock on this product does not work. The light does not shut itself off. These are both things the description said it should do. The only thing it does is stay semi-fogless. This is a rip off, do not buy."
1,Did not work,"The mirror did not work, the lights and clock did not work and I did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up, I would have to get a new box and take it to the UPS place to send it which would have cost me about another $10 and quite frankly, it was just not worth the time nor the money."
1,Stay away from this product,I was given the mirror as an X-Mas gift. I shave in the shower daily and the mirror remained clear for about 2 weeks and now it fogs almost instantly and will not clear. If you have hard water it will build up on the mirror coating leaving the mirror useless when dry. Just stay away from this one.
1,It's anything but fogless,"I received the Zadro Z Fogless mirror for Christmas and was excited because I needed a mirror in the shower for shaving. This mirror is a big disappointment, not only because the mounting eventually fell off the tile (despite careful cleaning of the tile before sticking it on), but because the mirror isn't 'fogless' at all. I end up having to constantly run it under the water so that I can actually see in the mirror, and I end up shaving using a small fraction of the area of the mirror that I can manage to keep from fogging up. I even tried to put some 'fog free' gel for use on the inside of a car windshield on it to no avail. As soon as I can find another mirror that works I'm tossing this one."
1,One Star is Generous!,A complete rip off. It is foggier than the foggiest day in Fogland. Only buy if you like fog and want a shaving mirror that fogs up before anything else in the bathroom.
2,Foggy and Faulty,"The mirror will only remain fogless for a couple showers...after that, will fog up faster than a normal mirror, and cleaning doesn't help. Additionally, the clock goes out after a few months (and I've replaced mine now three times with all the same things going wrong with each replacement) and the light stopped working in 2 of the 3 I've owned. Funny that I bought a fogless shower mirror from a grocery store for $4 that has been fog free for years."
1,Worthless waste of money,"This is a terrible shower mirror. My wife got it for me for a birthday presesnt and it's been trash bound ever since. The mirror worked pretty well for about a week, then as other reviewers have said, I had to start wiping it just about every stroke of the razor and then after a couple weeks, even wiping it did no good. Now, you can't see anything at all in it.Trash.Also, the light on this is pointless. It's not going to help you with shaving in any circumstance I can see.By a cheap fogless mirror and stay away from all the Zadro products if this 40 dollar flagship of the company is this bad."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF ....,"This mirror was horrible. It worked well for about a week then it had to be wiped down. Eventually no amount of cleaning was able to make it a mirror, let alone a fogless one. Do yourself a favor and not buy this product."
1,Fogless my .........!!!,Mirror was fogless for about a week. Have to constantly wipe down the mirror while shaving even with the shower turned off. What a piece of junk. $30 for what????
2,Fogless?,This mirror fogs up as bad or worse than any other mirror my husband has every used in the shower.
1,This thing sucks,"I bought it for my husband for xmas and it started fogging upi with in 3 months. It's a bit of an oxymoron to have the ""Z'Fogless"" label above a fogged mirror. We didn't wash it withe soap or anything. Just normal use. This thing is getting returned pronto."
1,Eh .. NO!,"Yeah we had this, got it from some place else other then Amazon.com and it was ""fogless"" for a month and then after a while it started to fog up again. Helpful though, if you put shaving cream on the mirror and let it set for a little bit 1 to 2 min and then wipe ( NOT WASH with water WIPE it off, it will NOT fog up.... try it ;)"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this mirror for my husband for Christmas and it is possibly the worst shaving mirror he has ever owned. For the first couple of weeks, it worked well. But, since then it fogs up and will not stay clean (even though we used the special cleaning solution). Furthermore, the LED light is somewhat schizophrenic - sometimes it stays on for weeks at a time and other times will not work at all. The clock face is not working any longer, even though we changed the batteries. And, my husband's razor falls out of its holder constantly. Do yourself a favor - buy a different mirror."
5,Outstanding,Excellent seller. I was replacing an identical mirror that wouldn't stick to the wall anymore. This one is just what I was looking for. And it really is fogless!
1,where's my face?,"i've been through a bunch of these mirrors, this has been one of the worst. After 1 month the mirror is no longer fogless and worse it collects water so that i can barely see my face when in the shower. look elsewhere."
1,Cheap,"Hi, bought this last year and I was very disappointed in the performance. It fogged up everytime and then it wouldn't stay attached to the shower wall. It would fall at least once a week. Followed instructions, but no help. Doesn't work as far as I'm concerned!Thanks,John W. Young"
1,Piece of junk,"Clock doesn't work, light is to bright, waiting for the mirror to fog up. Oh well, should have read the reviews better."
3,Box was very damaged,"Upon receiving this package, I immediately noticed that the Zadro product box had been previously opened and torn. Also, the ""fogless"" mirror, even with regular usage of the special cleaning fluid, fogs."
2,use soapy water,"Piece of crap mirror. But have never found anything better. Light and time worked for a year. Mirror needs soapy water to keep fog down. This is better price than I paid. So if you have to shave in the shower, get this here. Save $[...]."
4,batterys,"The mirror did come with a clock battery already in place, I later found out, but it was actually drained of it's energy. I had to take the mirror to a watch store at my local mall in order to get a new one, in addition to the 3 AA batteries for the light. Heads up....."
4,ZADRO FOGLESS LIGHTED SHOWER MIRROR.,"THE MIRROR IS GREAT, LOVE THE CLOCK, BUT THE LIGHT WILL NOT STAY ON, SO DON'T COUNT ON THAT. IT'S A GOOD THING I HAVE A SMALL BATHROOM WITH LOTS OF CEILING LIGHT, I DON'T NEED THE LIGHT, FOR MYSELF. I USE THIS, BUT AM NOT SURE OTHERS WOULD LIKE IT, WHEN A PART OF IT DOESN'T WORK."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this mirror for my boyfriend to use since the cheap one we bought at Target kept fogging up. I bought the product at the end of March and it worked fine for the first month....Now, you can't even see your reflection and it looks like it is constantly fogged up. A little over 3 months. Not worth the buy."
2,expected better,"Came to my house broken. Don't know if it was shipping or just cheap craftsmanship. Clock stopped working after three days and suction cups never held with the added weight of the razor. Also without the special soap the ""fogless"" mirror fogs up after about a month of use. Word to the wise if you purchase this item, pay for the better shipping, buy the fogless spray, and hang it by the rope given in the kit."
3,Fogless,"I was excited about finally getting a mirror for the shower that wouldn't fog and was lighted. Well, the mirror hasn't fogged yet. But, cold weather hasn't reached south Texas, yet, so the real test will come when I try to shave in a chilly shower enclosure. The light - well that's another issue. The timed light is a LED and bright. But it shines right in my eyes and makes it hard to shave while squinting against the bright light. I use the mirror without the light so I'd give the rig a 50% rating overall."
1,The Ney's have it.,"This review echos most out there: the mirror is fogless for about a week and then operates like every other mirror, the suction cups only adhere to glass otherwise fall off while you are at work, the clock stops working if it gets steamy.Zadro makes a cheaper $20 model, or you could just buy a handheld for $5, some ski goggle fogless cleaner, and a shoe string for the same affect.Having a mirror in the shower is helpful, but practical at $10-$20, not $40."
1,Lasted less than 3 months & warranty no good!,One burner screen burned out in less than 3 months and we just use it as an occasional patio heater in the evenings. The warranty information phone number only refers you to a web site with NO warranty information. You do find out that they don't make this heater any more and you can't even order the part and pay for it yourself. Major rip off!
4,The hit and miss heater,"It seems to me that before you buy this type of heater (one that works outdoors attached to a propane tank) you need to accept that certain inherent problems exist with this type of device. They all seem to be on the cheaply-made side. That's just a given. They're simply not designed to give you a lifetime of inexpensive, dependable heat.It was a little tricky to put together, but manageable. I swear you could melt steel with the heat it gives off.If you get a winter or two out of them, you're living good.For 75 bucks, how can you complain?"
3,GAS LEAKS,have had trouble since new with gas leaking from connection joints usually I could get it to stop but this yearwill not stop unit is about four years old - trying to contact phone number on box that is a waste of time also unable to contact help line on computer - so the unit is not usable so far this year - other wise has done a good job heating garage
4,Surprised by the low ratings,I loved these stories. I have been reading Nora Roberts books for awhile and haven't been moved and cried as I have with these stories. The title fits the stories. It is definitely From the Heart.
1,Yawn...,"These stories were just so...lifeless. I just couldn't get into the first one, there wasn't any depth or feeling in the characters.The second story was worse, and again no depth to the characters.The third story was okay, but then it became annoying when Liv started acting really rude to Thorpe, whom I found to be a great character. He didn't deserve Liv, she was mean and cold. There was no excuse for her behavior, no matter how bad her past was. She actually told him that he needed to check into a mental hospital, and that was when I gave up on the whole book."
3,"A good read, but...","I enjoyed all three of the stories, but ""A Matter of Choice"" reminded me rather strongly of Roberts' full novel, ""Hidden Riches,"" as ""Endings and Beginnings"" is reminiscent of ""Private Scandals."""
3,"Fun game, but short.","This was very unique in gameplay and story. They could have made the story a little longer or be able to restart the game from the beginning with everything you acquired. Maybe they thought that having so many side quests would keep players playing, but if you're only starting from a certain point of the story, eventually you'll get bored and want to pick something else up. It also would have been awesome if X actually had all his previous armors with being able to customize for the fights. Same goes for Zero, but that's what gets me into the games is X's armors. It's still fun, but you might be dissapointed on certain parts."
4,What money can't do.,"The ""Nitpicker's Guide for Classic Trekkers"" finds many glitches and contradictions with the original series, but we should expect that. The Original series was poorly understood, poorly funded, poorly received: Roddenberry did all he could to keep on the air two and a half seasons.The ""Nitpicker's Guide for Next Generation Trekkers"" shows, on the other hand, that even with the best minds who have the best understanding of the concept of science fiction in general and Star Trek in particular, even with Roddenberry at the helm, even with the best money and the best audience and the best ratings, they still could screw up. And badly. The value of this book is for anyone who would think any creation of man is more than mere entertainment, for the inconsistincies and contradictions Farrand exposes reveal man for what he is: you're lucky if you can get a decent cup of coffee out of him."
2,disappointing,This 2 disc recording was a disappointment. How do you make the tango dull? These guys found a way. You'll be hard pressed to distinguish one track from the next.
5,Reassembles the mosaic of pre-Holocaust Jewish life,"What this book does, like nothing else, is to recreate the diversity of Jewish life in Eastern Europe prior to the Holocaust. Carefully selected excerpts from hundreds of memorial books in the YIVO library, this book isn't just about some shtetl, but about Zionists and Misnagdim and town councils and about town that, well, ""most towns have a town fool, our town was so small that our village idiot was only half-crazy."""
1,Not Very Durable,"There are many interesting chemistry concepts you can expose to an enthusiastic youngster. I bought this kit for my son's eighth birthday. Found there weren't many experiments to try, explanations in the manual were simplistic, and key components were fragile and arrived broken. If it were more expensive and I felt my son would have cared, I would have asked for a replacement."
3,"Good price but, doesn't maintain interest well...","Purchased for my 8 year old son who loves anything with science. He did play with but, didn't seem to hold his interest (same deal with other sets like this that I purchased). Glad I didn't pay much."
3,"Poor editing, good general information","This book offers a general overview of the 3G technologies (also 2G and 1G) in a technical nature that's easy to understand by a technical person. However, frequently the reader will find repeated materials that shouldn't be there. The format of the book is not exactly very professional compare to book of similar subject. The authors should try to improve the writing and organization in the next edition."
3,UMTS technologies made simple (perhaps made too much simple),"Suitable for non-technical people. Very light on detail. Just an 600 pages overview of UMTS technologies and doesn't provide a clear picture. Books by European centric authors offer much better reading and clear picture of the technology (Kaaranen, Korhonen, Holma, Muratore). It seems ""demystifies"" series books from Mc Graw-Hill are less technical than the publiher's ""professional"" series books. 3G Wireless Networks by Collins from Mc Graw-Hill (Professional) is also a better raading."
4,Cute for kids,"The book has a page for each state, plus a page for the new 'gold' dollar, and a few facts on the history of US coins. For each state, there is one die-cut coin holder (2 for the dollar coin); some of these holders required great effort to get the coin to fit. The book also has a few pages of games...although one must note the error on page 70, ""...America RECEIVED its independence from Great Britain."" In reality, America DECLARED its independence from Great Britain in 1776, fought for 6 years, then negotiated for two. Congress ratified the treaty to end the war in January 1784. I hope next edition of this book corrects this error."
2,Most misleading cover box ever?,"In general, I'll sum up the ""The Star Maker"" by reiterating what other reviewers have stated here: if you rented this movie because it was the director's follow-up to the incredible Cinema Paradiso, you've set yourself up for a huge disappointment.But my big complaint has to do with the misleading cover box art (i.e., alluring woman with eyes peering out over sunglasses, ruby red lips, etc.). This has NOTHING to do with the movie. Such a character never appears. This image is about as far from the actual content of the film as you can get. I've lodged similar complaints about ""Brassed Off"" and ""East is East,"" both described by insipid marketers as ""wacky comedies."" Each is a great movie in its own right, but neither is a wacky comedy by any stretch. My question is: are the people that design these boxes for the American market just flat-out dumb, or are they simply completely cynical about the intelligence of the American audience?"
1,"""Sometimes the sun spins round and round and...............""","The present low price here for this cd is $13.67. I would happily give mine away if I could find anyone who wanted it. It is very well played and recorded, but utterly without inspiration.And it has a little bit of irritation, with a ridiculously titled vocal track (the only vocal) called ""The Wisdom Of Butter"", whose first line is ""Sky feminine"" and whose last is ""It's as simple as feelin' the breeze and the warm moonlight"". If you think the sky has a gender, and that moonlight is warm, this cd was meant for you. This song also talks of ""Bottles of stars opened to breathe"" and ""the Moon weeps"", and ultimately instructs you to ""Find your center"". So the Moon weeps warm moonlight. Are we clear?"
5,Important as history and for concise writing style.,"MAUDE is a vivid chronicle of life in the first half of this century. Mardo Williams' writing is exquisite, his reportorial style is pithy and wastes not a single word. On both counts this book should become an important reference manual."
1,Disappointing. Hand written text that's impossable to read.,Very small pictures that may have been valuable to the author. Meant very little to the reader especially with almost no explanantion for the pictures and all of that in nearly impossable to read hand-written text.
5,The best concert DVD of their 04' tour I have seen.,"Great DTS sound with the reg Dolbly Surround. Fine video.The band sounds great in the Paradise. Best to have a small venue for a Pixies concert. Good set list. Begins with Charles on acoustic with the band playing ""LA LA Love You"" then after ""Where's My Mind"" he switches to electric and blasts into ""Gouge Away"". Cool banter on stage. Good crowd. Just a little disturbing to see a woman dancing in a drunken haze downing beers one after another.Awesome concert."
2,Not the best one by a long shot.,"Pass , The live concert in Boston feels forced, it just does not work for me. Even the great Kim Deal seems to be drifting along.The good news is no matter how middle of the road this DVD is ,nothing can detract from the brilliant music the pixes have given us.This DVD is strictly for those who feel they must have everything by the Pixies. For the rest of us, just buy the Pixes by the pixes DVD , it is the best."
1,Same junk as the $20 one.,"I paid twice the amount as the other one on this site (the popular one that comes up when you search for a gable fan), that gets terrible reviews, thinking if I spend twice as much, I'll get at least twice as good. Nope. This is the same junk one people complain about with the little plastic tabs that come broken, out of the box. I'm not spending $15 to mail it back. I have the tools and skills to spend a couple hours putting little metal screws where the tabs are supposed to be. But I wanted plug and play, not another project. What a PITA. I'd pay $100 for an all metal one but I could not find it. Don't buy this thing."
2,The Picture is not what I recieved!,The picture shows a metal Gable shutter. I know this because I've ordered and recieved the metal ones before. This time I recieved Plastic ones.
1,ace hardware photo switch,The items pictured by Ace Hardware as Air Vent #54703 auto white gable shutter is not the item that is shipped.The pictured item appears to be made of better quality material with four louvers and attached with aluminum rivets. The items I received has three louvers and is made entirely of plastic. It looks like and feels like a piece of cheap trash. I called Ace immediately and requested a return.
5,"Good product, good service","Exactly what I needed, exactly as described. Fast shipment. What else is there?"
4,Badly Bent is very good,"I had heard a couple of tracks by King Biscuit Boy about 10 years ago and enjoyed what I had heard, but unable to get the cd's in Australia, I saw advertised on Amazon (thank you Amazon) the Badly bent album and listened to previews of each sonh and liked what I heard, so I purchased it. Listening to it at home, it really is a great album, the more I play it, the more I like it."
4,A Key To Understanding Apartheid,"While sometimes this book plods along with obscure family histories (which, admittedly, is part of its purpose), it remains one of the best attempts at explaining the psychology of the Afrikaner people.Like most Africans, I had, for a long time, a knee-jerk negative reaction to the Afrikaner people and all they stood for. However, this is the book that first opened my eyes to why the Afrikaners behaved they way they did, and why they may have believed that apartheid, universally abhorrent as it was, was necessary.Please read it."
2,An Apology in Disguise,"The book is nothing more than an apology of Apartheid. Despite the authors attempts at justifying apartheid, he sometimes goes to great lengths in trying to explain its existence to the out side world. He also protrays Afrikaaners as people who did not understand the world reaction to their blatant form of nazism, apartheid. It does not help that he potrays the latter as very ethoncentric, curniving and racist individuals."
5,ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!!!,"This book was so refreshing! I initially bought it because I have always had a fascination with the ""mermaid city"" my mom has always told me stories of that she used to visit as a child in Florida. I even decorated my room as a child from her vintage postcards from Weeki Wachi Springs, FL (I am assuming this novel is based on this place). I adored reading this book. The characters are so fun and you really get to know them, you want to be their friend, you want to be a ""merhag"". This is a perfect read for your day at the pool or on your next beach vacation! I can't wait for her next novel!"
4,Very nice novel,"I enjoyed this book very much. It has much the same feel as Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, though perhaps a bit less depressing. It doesn't bore the reader with cliche situations, but rather speaks to anyone who has dealt with family problems. I would recommmend this book to anyone that enjoys the type of drama that is based almost entirely on deep character interactions instead of plot twists."
2,"Overpriced, overengineered, and misleadingly promoted","Can't say these are worth the money; there are reputable 2400mAh to 2500mAh rechargeable AA batteries out there at half the price, by companies from Maha to Energizer. Also, the fine folks at Monster Cable are fond of threatening lawsuits to any company with ""monster"" in the name, including the job search site and a clothing reseller. Sending your money to a company with such underhanded tactics and a marketing division exponentially better funded than their research is your choice, but I would recommend in the face of alternative suppliers that you choose against it.They get two stars because I'm reasonably sure their product will not melt your device.(review title quoted from dansdata)"
2,Not enough meat!,"I wanted more detail in this book since I recently found that my G-G-Grandfather served with the 48th Geogia Volunteer Infantry. The author gives a rudimentary history overview of the Regiment, but fails to put thier contributions in perspective."
3,Not for younger kids,"We already had the I can play piano, so I thought this would be a real winner for my 7 year old. As of yet, she's not real into it. I've even had a little trouble playing the game. I'm sure with time, it will become easier. So my suggestion is that this toy is geared more for older children."
2,Dissapointing,"The book is really outdated. It suggests using a computer to help keep track of things. Gee, ya think? It is also not well organized/laid out. Instead it is a stream of unrelated statements/tips. I bought the book because I recently started an organizing business under the same name and figured that at some point I would be asked about this book. I can now say that I have read it and that I do not recommend it."
2,"Uninspired, poor layout",I brought this book with me to Paris and ended up buying 2 other guidebooks once I arrived there. The maps were hard to use and the suggested itineraries were really just the status quo. I recommend Lonely Planet instead for cheap and unique ideas.
5,Inspirational!,"I highly recommend this book. I was completely spellbound the first time I looked at it. You may hear about copying floor tiles into a quilt pattern, but to see the actual end results is...well, amazing. These are some of the most beautiful quilts I have ever seen, and the instruction to make one of your own are simple and very clear.In short, it is one of the most inspirational books I have ever purchased. After reading it, I find myself discovering quilt patterns in more and more places.This book definitely belongs in your quilting library."
3,Good for the pool,"This toy would be great to play with at the beach or in the pool. Otherwise, it would be useless in a good water fight. The problem is that it has no reservoir so after one long squirt you have to reload.It has a big heavy stream, & if the person playing with it is quite strong it could be a very long range ""weapon"".It would not be handy for a small child to use, it takes some strength to get any distance at all, & when fully extended measures about 3 & a half feet long.This gun could cause injury to the eyes if a direct hit is made.I rate this toy ""fun for the pool but not for the park"", & suitable only for older kids & adults."
5,BETTER IN AMERICA,my wife bought 2 of these 10 years ago before we were married. they work just as great today as they did when she first bought them. i purchased 2 additional water cannons for additional water(fire) power for when we go on canoe trips w/ friends. unlike the cheap crap(quality & durability)that we are forced to purchase from china these AMERICAN made blasters are far more superior and made w/ the quality that AMERICANS expect. the cheap crap that comes from china just cant compete on any level. on our last trip most of the water blasters that everyone else had (all were made in china) broke w/in an hour of our canoe trip. i look for AMERICAN made products before i purchase anything from other countries. when forced to purchase anything from china it turns my stomach. i highly recommend this product and other AMERICAN MADE products.
1,piece of junk!,"Bought this thing based on reviews...mistake! The reviews do not describe the item I received. First it won't hold water in the barrel, it just runs out. Secondly, there is no way this thing will shoot 60ft. I'm sending it back. Called the number on the package with no luck. JUNK."
1,Not for a smaller kid,"This item was too big and cumbersome for my 7 year old nephew to use comfortably. The water did not shoot as far as claimed, but that may be due to the fact that you need quite a bit of strength to hold the cannon full of water and exert signicant force to get the water to propel. It was very difficult for me, too! My nephew happened to receive other water guns for his birthday, as well, and he's enjoying these much more."
5,Water gun review,"We have one of the older water guns, same shape, but much harder to use. This water blaster is great."
4,It's a blast,The kids love it. My only complaint is that its range is only about 30 ft; it probably won't make it to the squirrels raiding my bird feeder in the back yard.
5,Watched repeatedly,"Our child has pulled this out of the library since she was 5. She's now 14, and this video still helps calm her when she's anxious. Really a wonderful video, very instructive. Active boys have watched it calmly. Wish we could find a DVD version. The video is timeless."
4,Beautiful ballads and pop hits,"This Lp,released in 1984 as a follow-up to TOO LOW FOR ZERO ,consolidated Taupin's return to his songwriting alliance with Elton John.This was best illustrated in love songs such as IN NEON ,BURNING BUILDINGS and the title track.The main hit single,SAD SONGS(SAY SO MUCH) and the second one WHO WEARS THESE SHOES? proved Elton was still #1 in the pop music world.Some tracks such as RESTLESS and SLOW DOWN also made an appearance on rock charts whilst PASSENGERS made a dent on European territories."
2,Pretty lifeless,"This album has a few half decent tracks - ""Who Wears These Shoes', 'Slow Down Georgie', ""Breaking Hearts"", ""Passengers"" but the overall feel is pretty plastic and detached. He's just not putting much emotion into this one. Not really any bad or annoying songs, but this was the first album where the music sounds like it was done on a machine (actually I think it was).Update : the remastered version of this goes a long way towards making the music sound much better. The first CD issue of this really squeezed the life out of the recording."
4,"Good ,yet another return to excellence as two low for zero.","It has In Neon on it ,but wait the rest is good and makes for a good album, so i'd consider buying this one.L'il Frigerator is the weakest track but rocks better than anything on Ice on fire , Leather Jackets or Reg strikes back. Passengers,Did He shoot her,Sad Songs,Breaking Hearts,Burning Buildings and Who Wears these shoes are all excellent.The rest i'd say is either Good or Very Good but not quite Excellent as the tracks i mentioned above,A keeper for sure."
2,Just Okay,"Alright, Breaking Hearts may sound great in comparison to Leather Jackets or Ice on Fire. But it's still a rather lifeless effort. Like Too Low For Zero, this one suffers from complacency; it's representative of industry product rather that pop/rock magic. Even Sad Songs (Say So Much), the obvious hit, is a bit too comfortable for me, lacking the glitz, warmth and buzz of Elton's crucial 70's work. I'll take Bennie and the Jets, Tiny Dancer, Pinky, Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters over any of the songs on this album."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the objective reviewer...""Sad Songs"" is the only stand out track with a couple of decent songs...not enough to warrant a better rating."
3,Technical Data,"Tons of data, this book is difinitely not a workbook. Does not give you breakdown or other info. Wish there was a repair manual for the 964. Don't see much us for this as of yet."
4,Good Quality,"Clear and concise illustrations of many of the 964 systems and assemblies. Nothing on interior systems ( window switches, door panels, climate control..etc.. ) or body such as the retractable spoiler... which I has hoping to find some info on...., Seems no 'one' book or source of mechanical / repair info on this vehicle / 964 is complete in and of it's self. I have found this to be a valuable addition to resource info on the 964."
3,Very good book on Silver and Silverplate,"This small book contains a good deal of information on collecting silver and silverplated items. Its illustrated listing of American and English silversmiths and their marks seems comprehensive. The only problem is that the price guide is rather out of date, being compiled in 1978."
5,The Everyday Bath Book : A Soak for the Soul,"This is a MUST have for all bath lovers! It is the perfect meditation companion, and makes your relaxation/down time more meaningful. The affirmations have soothed my soul many a time, and I especially like the aromatherapy suggestions for each theme (i.e. eucalyptus & juniper for the ""Healing Bath"", or ylang ylang & ginger for the ""Sensual Bath""). It makes a fun gift for friends, too! I highly recommend it."
1,Bad Listing,"This listing indicates you will recieve 10 packages of 100 for $4.99. And you pay for 5 lbs of shipping (about $8.00). This would make sense. However, you only recieve one package of 100 skewers. I am out over $20.00 now. My loss is your warning."
3,Cutest thing ever...but don't lose it!,"These are terribly cute and functional, but the ball chain that comes with it is not very secure. I had mine LESS THAN TWO DAYS before the ball chain snapped and I lost both my Tetran and my iPod headphones. I will be replacing both of them, but I won't be using the ball chain to attach it to my purse again."
4,Should have made him a superstar!!!,"This album had it all, 10 songs that could have all been singles; excellent honky-tonk sound; and awesome cover art. If this were released in 1955, it would have knocked Webb Pierce off his rocker!!!!!Timeless music. I don't know what else to say. This is one of those cd's that you will be able to sing along with every song!! And who would have ever thought that Mark Chesnutt could cover early period Charlie Rich (Who Will The Next Fool Be) and actually make the song his?I paid full price for this cd when it was realeased, now you can get it for budget price. You have no excuse not to have this."
1,Extremely Dangerous,"At Lovebirds On The Common, I have over 250 Lovebirds, they do LOVE the Happy Hut. Unfortunately, threads come loose inside or outside and the birds get tangled in them. I have had one die from strangulation and two that have lost legs and toes. These were new Huts that were inspected by me. I have also had dozens of other incidents with the loose threads, but luckily found the birds in time to free them. I have removed all Happy Huts and put them in the trash. Probably well over $1,000.00 wasted. There is a much better brand on the market made of fleece. I can be contacted through my web site, www.aviary-amore.com"
5,------------------------------------------------------------,"This is a really great episode, especially so for those who are more fans of Deanna Troi. Marina Sirtis and Majel Barrett have some very emotional scenes in this one, and they do it beautifully."
4,nice cleaning center,This is a nice cleaning center to keep all the small parts and cleaning supplies organized. The arms have 2 different slots on either end to position the gun with one side lower or level depending on needs. This is perfect for longer rifles and even fits the collapsable stocks with it fully extended. sturdy platform for cleaning!!!!
1,Bad Product!,"The only reason that I gave it one star it is the lowest that amazon software will allow me to go, it deserves zit. I am writing this so you may save your money. I am on my third heater due to the other replacements being faulty and just cheaply made right out of the box. I have one on my desk now my help is cold its Sunday and I am in a bind. The knob has caught on fire before and it ignites behind the screen. I have another heater that I would like to suggest for you to get I have never had any problems with it. It is a Paulin and it's trouble free heat. Their website may be found at www.bpproducts.com It does not get cold in the deep south but when it does its darn cold and you need a dependable heater. sign Rebel Yell"
2,"Could have been great, but...","I have to agree completely with another reviewer who rated this. In spite of the fact that there are some great old favourites here, the company that repackaged these chose to put its large, blue logo in the bottom right of the corner and leave it there throughout the entire playing of these commercials. So obtrusive is it that at times it actually blocks out key words or parts of the commercial. Whoever the brains was behind this decision should find work elsewhere. Media is clearly not your forte.This video ranks among the long list of compilation packages that ""could have been."" Unfortunately, it never actually ""is""..."
1,Hilariously Horrible,"The acting is terrible. Ditto for the dialogue. The video is grainy and barely watchable. But if you're looking for laughs, this movie is perfect. If you're like me, and you're one of those people who find pleasure in unbearable movies, you'll love this one. Trousdale and Amariah are painful, but they are so painful that they are wonderful. See what I mean? Rent it and enjoy 93 minutes of pure, unintentional comedy."
1,Sophomoric,"The movie contains a silly plot, over the top bad acting and poorly filmed concert segments. I can see why this movie sat on a shelf for years, never opened in theatres and went directly to video."
3,it's ok,ok i only bought this movie because chris trousdale is in it and i thought it'd be a little bit good but i was wrong the graphics are horrible the acting is horrible and the screenplay is childish but i give it 3 stars because i liked the ending
3,"The movie is bad, but in a funny way","I was a huge Dream Street fan when I was younger, so I've seen this movie a couple times. I was actually an extra and have about a 1 second cameo, so I have to think its awesome. But to tell you the truth, it's one of the most horrible movies of all time. I even thought so in the height of my Dream Street obsession. So unless you absolutely love Dream Street, or really enjoy laughing at bad movies..you don't want to buy this."
3,so so,"The children in this movie lack any refined acting skills. While the story-line is cute, it's not something i intend to watch again."
2,not hot,okay so i watched the movie with a friend at my place first i thought the dvd wasnt worcking very good and i tested it on the 4 dvds i own the view of the moviewas horrible first i think i could tape it bymyself and second the sound is just terrible also chirs looks so young in the movie and the girl looks awful also i think my parents were born when they made this movie oh my gosh is so old im just saing the truth man i gave like a gift the dvd to my maid god people this movie really sucks ! i first bought it because i saw all the great reviews and saw the hottie on the cover but come on chirs is like 13 when he filmed the movie and he has the hair up like weeew just belive me if you are wanting to buy a movie just like mean girls but with a lot of love THIS IS JUST NOT THE MOVIE trust me.
2,eww - old -but WAY too young...,"If this was SCHEDULED to be released in 2001, when was it filmed?? Jesse Mccartney (okay everyone knows who he is) is 18 now! who would want to see a few seconds of him in his little pre-teen made band that only little preteen girls knew about -underage? Creepy. Now Jesse seems to be the only successful one, but the cover of the movie box shows that if Chris continued in the same direction, he should be also very good-looking right now - unlike the other little boys. It wasn't released so long for a reason- if Chris wants a career, he should be focusing on the future and the age he is now. This is clearly ONLY for the little pre-teen fans of dreamstreet whenever they existed."
1,don't waste your money,"save your money for some real protection for your gear (panamax, furman, etc.). i have a powerbar and during the recent storms in southern california lost my rotel av receiver to a brownout despite it being hooked up to one of these. never mind the bold claims about how these glorified surge protectors will enhance your system's sound and picture. spend your money, instead, on protecting your investment."
5,Crunchy goodness,"If you are the type of person who digs around in the bottom of the bag after the popcorns gone looking for the half popped kernels of corn then you will definately like these. The white cheddar and kettle corn are especially good. Instead of digging through the bag at the end you get your own can of partially popped corn. The only drawback is they do have those pesky shells that get stuck between your teeth, but overall my family loves to munch on them."
2,"Sub Rosa,...Non! Sub Standard,...Oui!","While many episodes of the series rarely focused on ship's physician, Dr. Beverly Crusher, this one does and, unfortunately, it's rather tame with little that is commendable. At the end of my initial viewing, I couldn't help but wonder the mindset behind this installment. Repeat viewings have not altered this puzzlement."
1,Painful,"Crusher is prepared to throw in her career for the sake of her new lover, Ronin - the family ghost who has loved the women of her family since the seventeenth century. But why isn't she telling her friends what's going on? And what is the connection with the problems with Caldos II's weather control system?Gothic romance meets Star Trek? This might have been a good idea in theory, but it didn't come off. The writing is bad and the acting is over the top. The reasons for Crusher's strange behaviour are never really made clear. The faux Scottish setting is twee. And so what if Ronin made Crusher's female ancestors very, very happy? He was a lying creep who fed on them for centuries!I would go so far as to call this episode unwatchable."
1,Bizarre!,"This episode where Beverly Crusher gets it on with some kind of ghostly being is the strangest episode I have ever watched, not just of a Star Trek the Next Generation episode but of any TV show period!"

5,"A simple, deep and life changing","This book is amazingly simple, yet profoundly deep.This book is very professional, yet very acceptable by common people.All what I can say is that it is the strongest public and buisness relations book I have ever read."
1,"can't handle burned cds, bad scratch protection","I work at a college radio station, and we just ordered a pair of these cd players to replace some denons. to be succinct: they suck. they cannot handle burned cds at all, and they'll skip at the slightest scratch. My ten buck discman has better compatability than this POS. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2,Very Dissatisfied User,"I purchased a Linksys Cable/DSL router for my home network, had up and running in 20 min and have had operational and trouble free for nearly a year. I was tempted to get the Linksys wireless solution as a result of my good luck with the router. Unfortunately, I decided to get the D-Link product because of its lower price point at the time. I had multiple configuration issues, had running for while, then lost all connectivity. The installer (an uninstaller) froze my laptop and caused errors on boot...needless to say a bad experience. Not sure why PC Mag rated this unit high. I returned the D-Link and bought the Linksys wireless product the same day. Back to what I know is a reliable company."
1,poor deposition training item,"This dvd tells witnesses how to provide a convincing or compelling story, not how to testify truthfully. It seems to encourage embellisment, dramatics and outright lying by a witness. I feel this product is shamefull and will not use it to prepare witnesses."
5,A Real Winner! I highly recommend this book...,I got this DVD because it was recommended by my attorney. It reallysaved me from making a total fool of myself on the stand during cross-examination. I was surprised to read the reviewer who said the DVD wasabout lying - I completely disagree. This DVD is all about helpingyou get your truth across in a way other people can understandclearly. It has nothing to do with deception. It's about keeping yourthoughts straight and being able to tell your story without letting awhole bunch of emotion cloud the issues. A real winner!
4,Good Video,"I was referred to this video while at a labor seminar for police representatives. Interesting enough, this video shows what not to do when being deposed, and come off as a respectable individual. Its an older video, but the points are still relevant."
1,Hey can I get a refund?,"This DVD was neither a good value or a good source of information. If your I.Q. is extremely below average then perhaps you may benefit from watching it. However, if you have any sort of education, you will most likely find this a waste of time and money. Additionally, I found Dr. Nelson to be condescending in many instances.I am looking for real advice about how to handle cross-examinations. This DVD covers only a very few basic communication strategies that most people are already well aware of in the context of daily life.Due to the fact that this DVD lacks any solid and beneficial information, I would love to get my money back. Additionally, I would not recommend this to anyone. It is the biggest waste of $35 I have ever spent!"
1,TOO BASIC FOR TESTIFYING DOCTORS,"The description of this video is misleading. The content is for the layperson, not a professional, such as a doctor. It was too basic and too simple. What a waste of money."
2,An Enterprise crewman commits suicide?,"One of the worst episodes from the final season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. After a crewman commits suicide by jumping into the plasma stream, Troi begins having strange empathic flashes when she investigates."
5,Smells Great and Works Great,I love this oil. I use it as massage oil and it does not irritate my skin. I also use it as shaving cream and it creates nice soft non-irritated skin. it is worth it for the price and works great!
5,Light smell,Light smell and did not leave a greasy feeling on the skin. Great price. Asorbs a bit fast if you are looking for a long term massage oil this might not work for you.
5,This Almond Oil is a great product,"I use this after shower to moisturize all over. Makes my skin baby soft! I also use it in my hair and scalp. Makes my hair super shiny and soft without leaving a greasy feel. My scalp gets really dry sometimes, so this oil completely moisturizes my scalp and keeps away flakes and soothes itching. I bet it would be great for a sexy massage too. When I get a new boyfriend, I'll let you know!"
4,Great oil,This works really well and last a while for an oil. It's not in the best bottle for an oil but still works.
5,Great moisturizer and all natural,"I had been using coconut oil on my skin as a moisturizer, make up remover, hair cream, you name it, I used coconut oil for it, but I have not tried any other natural oils, except for sweet almond oil which I tried a while back but the one I tried had a strong smell to it, so I'm so glad this one is unscented so I can add essential oils of me liking. I use this oil for body and face care and also for my hair, I love it!"
5,The best oil,I use it on body and face. It's a great for dry scalp and Natural hair(Afro) not only for adult but for children as well. It's working great for me.
5,lite unscented oil,I really like this product. It is unscented and goes on very nicely. It is not a heavy oil and feels great on my skin. I originally purchase this brand at a health food store. I was really happy to find it at Amazon at half the price.
5,Good stuff,"This stuff is perfect, not too greasy and absorbs in the right amount of time. Works great for hair too, it helped eliminate frizz after blow drying, because I live in a wet climate. Good for you unless you're allergic to nuts!"
3,Almond oil,"It was what I ordered but, didn't smell like I expected. Kind of thought it would have that wonderful Almond smell."
5,Love this!,I bought this oil to make Sugar Scrub for Christmas gifts! I absolutely loved the result and so did the recipients. The Almond Oil smells amazing and I will definitely purchase it again in the future for another Sugar Scrub recipe!
4,Good Value,"This is a great addition for my homemade products, it arrived on time, and I would recommend it over any more expensive one."
5,Happy,"I bought the almond oil to use with other oils, this oil alone makes my hair very soft.I am very pleased with my purchase.Also the size it bigger than what I thought."
5,great quality,"i bought this oil to make my homemade chapstick and lotion bars with. i have never used this oil before and am really glad i made this purchase, the oil is great to use by itself on your face as a nice moisturizer. this bottle had lasted me a long time. i have barely made a dent in it. will be buying again when needed."
5,Fast shipping and securely packaged!,I love how this feels when I put it on my skin as a moisturizer. It feels smooth and soft. I don't remember if there was a smell to this but if I can't remember than it didn't bother me. Definitely recommend!
5,great product,i tried the almond oil as soon as i got it. the results were amazing. i felt my skin instantly getting smoother and moisturized all day long.
4,I like it,"This oil is not as thick as the castor oil, but i like it. It's not heavy, it's a light moisturizer. This bottle will probably last me all year. I use it on my hair, nose, under eye, etc. I mix it with castor oil, both products seem to make my hair really soft. I really like that it doesn't have a scent, so nothing to irritate your face."
4,Makes my hair soft,"I have wavy and coarse hair but I have to use a clarifying shampoo that keeps away my dandruff. I do use a daily conditioner but its doesn't seem enough. I've tried many products (low to high end) and nothing helps. I finally read that women in India keep their hair nice by using Sweet Almond Oil. Simple enough and it works. While my hair is damp, I put 2-3 drops of oil in my hand and run it down my hair and use the leftover for my baby hairs by my forehead to keep it manageable. The smell isn't strong, a little goes a long way and I love the way my hair looks/feels."
5,Really nice product,I was looking for a good price to make my home made face lotion and this is it!I mixed it with shea butter and vitamins and it is a smooth nice lotion with the almond oil as a base.It feels good to have such a nice lotion with real products in it for a fair price.
4,"Good, simple almond oil","I bought this product because the ingredients read only almond oil (no tocopherols etc), which is what I wanted.It doesn't have any smell at all (an almond smell would have not bothered me), and that's why I removed 1 star.Overall is a good product."
4,nice,I use Sweet Almond Oil for many different purpose. It's excellent for making the day cream and hand cream. 16OZ can last for long.
5,Great for massage,This product is almost odorless and wonderful for massage. A little bit goes a long way; I've given several hour-long massages and the oil level has not dipped below the top of the label yet (white label version).
5,no smell,I have very very dry skin.I like this product because it does not smell like anything.For those of you who do not like greasy..do not buy this. It is oil so oil=greasy... BUT you could always mix it with your favorite lotion to make it less greasy. Just a drop or two mixed with your lotion and it goes a long wayIt is very good in moisturizing.
4,Best oil to nourish your hair,"Sweet almond oil is great for hair since it locks in moisture and seals it within the hair strand. It's also great to use as a carrier oil, very moisturizing and beneficial for the skin. Awesome quality and quantity for the price, will repurchase again!"
3,Nothing sweet about this almond oil,"I bought this because I have heard a lot about using almond oil to give the skin a glow and it having great benefits because it is all natural. I have seen more expensive options in health food stores that smelled wonderful, so when I saw this product labeled ""sweet almond oil"" I was immediately excited especially since the price was so good. I cannot smell anything and the oil dries so quickly that I doubt it leaves any sort of 'glow'. Needless to say I am very disappointed. I only gave it three stars because I will probably use it on my hair since it is so light and can work well to soak quickly into my scalp.If I have better results as some of the other reviewers, I will update my review to reflect that, though I seriously doubt it."
3,it's almond oil,I'm not sure why it's so expensive when it says right on the bottle that it's food grade. It doesnt have any smell which was a bummer. i use it on both me and my toddler without any issues. I'm not sure i'd order it again. I want something with a scent.
2,Almond Oil,This one has some odour so not fun to use it on the skin. OK for salads etc. Better product is from lorann oils
1,Not Sweet!,"Sweet Almond Oil has a very distinctive scent. This doesn't smell like anything. Literally. I can't even say the scent is faint. It just doesn't smell. Which, to me, rather defeats the purpose of buying this oil as opposed to any other.In my experience it's hard to find large bottles of sweet almond oil, so I was very excited at seeing a whopping 16oz, but now it's irritating and upsetting to have purchased such a large bottle of this stuff only to find it could well be any other bath oil.If you've used sweet almond oil before: This product may seem like a deal, but don't waste your money.If you've never used sweet almond oil before: It's wonderful stuff. I highly recommend it. Just not this brand."
5,Hooked,"I really love this stuff, especially as a facial moisturizer at night. It seems to work at least as well as the more expensive serum I was using and better than olive oil. The company philosophy appeals to me a great deal, too. I'm hooked!"
4,Love it!!!,"I absolutely love Almond Oil especially from NOW... Not only is it an excellent oil to seal hair with but my skin responded very well to it. The only thing I didn't like is the oil isn't very thick so it had a tendency to run, as well as the top would open when I was traveling... I'll just put it in another bottle =p... I dare not stop buying it!!"
3,a little skeptical,"Meh........Product has absolutely no smell, was expecting sweet almond oil that smelled like sweet almond oil. Instead it just kind of smells like vegetable oil :/. probably won't purchase this again!"
2,Is this really almond oil?,This seems more like a vegetable cooking oil. No almond scent and doesn't absorb like any almond oil I have ever used. I won't buy from this company again.
3,"It's good, but doesn't heal my dry winter hands",I like that its natural and doesn't chill me out like lotion. But during the winter months when my hands get super dry I have to mix the oil with lotion or use just lotion to save them.
4,Goes good even for hair,Trying to use it after my friend recommended it for preventing hair fall. I have already seen the effects on my friend.
5,Great body oil,"Works great as baby oil -i just put few drops in my baby's bath water. He sometimes likes to ""drink"" it so it's great that the oil is of ""edible quality"". It has no scent and nothing artificial. It's a BIG bottle;"
4,Nice,"This is nice to apply after showering, makes the skin very soft but overall I prefer the multi-tasking coconut oil so that is what I will stick with."
5,Great,"I have tried just about every lotion and moisturizer out there. I received this yesterday and already I see a difference in my skin. I only use a few drops and there is a lot of coverage and it isn't oily or greasy. I am very pleased with this and would definitely recommend this to anyone with dry skin, I also like the fact that is all natural."
3,Leaked,"I like now products and have purchased this oil many times before from different health food stores. when I opened the box containing this and a few other things, I realized it had leaked all over. The lid wasn't screwed on properly. Luckily the package didn't contain anything that could have been damaged."
4,Wonderful oil,I bought this a while ago and I'm about to purchase some more. I did a lot of research to find the right almond oil to buy for all my homemade products and this one is great. The first one I purchased from a different seller had fragrance and I thought this will too but it didn't. And I was disappoint and thought I bought the wrong oil. That is until I found out that Fragrance contains a lot of chemicals that is harmful to our health and nobody should purchase anything with Fragrance in it. So thank God for this seller and the wonderdul natural product that is made by them.
1,No almond flavor.,"The almond oil was stated to be of culinary quality. In contrast to other (more expensive) almond oils that I have purchased, this product lacked the subtle taste of almonds. I wouldn't purchase it again."
1,Oily and Not fast absorving,Big disapointment after reading all the positive reviews. This thing is oily and does not absorve quickly feels like kicthen oil. I orignaly used Kama Sutra sweet almond oil which is impressive how the skin feels good. I tought I would be saving money by purchasing Now pure almond oil and have same effect as Kama Sutra oil. But I was wrong. This is a lower grade oil and very poor quality.
3,Glad to have on hand,The main reason for this purchase didn't turn out satisfactory. It's too drying for my hair; but will use on skin.
4,Works well for what I wanted.,"Works well, but it does not pour very well. I'm haven't learned the trick in pouring this yet. I'm not sure if it is me or the bottle or a combination of the two, but I got almost as much on the cabinet as I did in the measuring spoon."
4,Economical and Practical,I use this to make a facial moisturizer by mixing in a little bit of essential oils. It goes into my skin easily and doesn't create a greasy feel.
5,WOW!,"I originally purchased this for ""oil pulling"". GAG! So one morning I decided to try it straight on my face, I am crazy in love with it! Now I combine it with all of my lotions and it is a daily stable in my skin care. It feels so nice on my face, hands, and body."
4,got both sweet and bitter almond oil to get scent and moisture.,"Great feel, absorbs well on skin and hair. Left hair soft and my hair sheds less! Wish it smelled like traditional almond oil. But I found out that it's the bitter almond oil with the scent. The bitter isn't a moisturizing oil so I've bought both and added a free drops to my sweet almond oil to get the best of both worlds."
4,No what I expected.,"I was pleased with the large size bottle. I was not pleased that there was no ""almond"" scent to this product. I had read the reviews before ordering and others had mentioned the scent. Mine had a smell just like cooking oil. While it works fine, I really wanted the almond scented oil."
3,Not sure,I cannot personally recommend this product. I have only used it with other oils as recommended by others but do not know if it truly works on its own.
4,It's almond oil,I purchased it to use as a conditioner for my hair. I haven't used it yet but it's in a nice labeled bottle and I'm sure it will be fine.
2,Wasnt as expected!!,I had ran out of my previous stock of almond oil from India and was looking to buy a good grade sweet almond oil. I was pleased reading the reviews and I was tempted into buying it. The product didnt quite turn out to be as I had expected. I felt it was much thinner and less viscous than the oil I paid for from India. Especially when I paid twice the money for the same quantity of oil i expected it to be atleast similar to the one I had. Disappointed... :(
5,Natures Moisturizer,"What could be better for the skin than a simple, one ingredient, all natural product? NOW Foods Sweet Almond Moisturizing Oil is fabulous. It's great for all over moisturizing. The best part is that it can be applied all over the face even under the eyes and on the nose. It's not greasy and absorbs into the skin as though it was something the skin had been craving. I prefer it to olive oil as a moisturizer. I'm so glad I found it. I've found it to be a great value and plan to use it from now on."
2,Not all leather,"The reason I gave this product two stars only is because only the outer layer (of the two that are there) is made of lather. The inside one is synthetic and has cracked in several places, at the place where it is bent."
5,My church is not of silver and gold,"Nothing says I worship HIM like a good old shinny box set! Now if you love HIM, every HIM song, every HIM video, and every HIM everything, you'll love this box set. *Now if you don't like every HIM song, get lost. what's wrong with you?* I highly recommend this to any hardcorer"
5,the H.I.M. HITS,"this is the newest release from the great rock band HIM...its not an album.....its just a collection of HIM's hits ...the songs that made them popular and the perviously unreleased single IT'S ALL TEARS(drown in this love)..maybe the new album will be like the first album..thats why they put this single..this is a great oportunity for the him fans...to listen the rare tracks,remixes and live recordings from HIM....there are very good remixes and some rare tracks and the fans should take the chance and buy the single collection...it will worth"
1,Collection of Crap,"This band is absolute trash! Some of the worst music I've ever heard. I love the CKY videos but Bam should have stuck with just CKY for the soundtracks or better yet have Brandon DiCamillo make up more songs. H.I.M. must stand for Horrible Idiotic Music because it sounds like the worst noise imaginable. Imagine a dump truck backing up at 7am with the ""beep beep beep"" noise topped off with dragging a metal dumpster along the asphalt, just grinding away what's left of your ears and giving you a headache. That's what HIM sounds like.Wake up kiddies and teeny boppers, just because you love Bam Margera doesn't mean you have to love his favorite band too! THINK FOR YOURSELF! This music is HORRIBLE! Notice how Raab, Rake, Bran and the rest of the crew never sport HIM attire? Can you actually call yourself a fan after watching what a tool the lead singer is? He looks like more of a flamer than Siegfried & Roy, only not as tan. Excuse me while I go puke..."
4,Short but Sweet,"This book is a brief eye-opener for anyone who consumes dairy, unaware of what is in the products they are consuming, and what dairy products are doing to them. My only complaint is that the book is too short. It is a great place to start for anyone concerned with their own health, and does disclose numerous medical journals and studies to verify its claims. I'd recommend checking out the author's website (notmilk.com). I am happy I bought a copy."
1,Lacking content,"I recently became interested in learning more about milk when I stumbled upon a website claiming that milk is horrible for you. I ended up purchasing this book so that I could learn about the dangers of milk.I was disappointed with this book, because it is not a very good introduction to the topic. It is a short summary, and although references are given, the book lacks explanation for most of the symptoms listed. This book would be more appropriate for children/teenagers. If you are looking for a thorough and convincing investigation into the hazards of drinking milk, this is not your book. At least, it didn't convince me. Also, in my opinion, the price for this book is about twice what it should be."
2,I agree that todays milk is bad........,"but this guy way overstates his case. Many can't tolerate milk but milk has been used by very healthy people for a very long time. Grains and soy are probably much worse for you than milk. If the only problems with soy were phytates - soy wouldn't be so bad. But thats actually only the tip of the iceberg.So yes, todays pasteurized milk is not a healthy food but clean raw milk can be a healthy food for some. In contrast, soy and soy milk isn't fit for anyone."
2,Disappointed,"I like to stay informed, but I like my information more balanced than this. The title, Milk A-Z, suggests that this book will explain everything, pros and cons, from A to Z, but instead the book seems to be little more than a one-man assault on the dairy industry. While the author did quote a lot of experts, I still felt that I was getting pieces of the puzzle, not the whole picture. This made me suspect.Even if all you want is one side of the story, the way the book was arranged - A to Z - also made it difficult to put it together in my mind, although it made it easy to pick up and read small sections at a time. Overall, this book was a disappointment, and I would not recommend it."
1,Junk,In Robert Cohen's A-Z book a grain of truth balloons into fantasy. This book is inaccurate and full of junk science. It is nothing more than conspiracy theories and paranoia. Mr. Cohen web site is worse.
1,This guy is a quack!,"Robert Cohen fills this book with so much tin-foil hat, conspiracy logic that it is almost entertaining to read. The only person who would enjoy this probably hasn't taken a biology course, and is sitting in their basement waiting for the aliens to abduct them. Don't waste your money!!!!!!"
1,Not Even Close to the Truth,I completely disagree with Mr. Cohen's treatment of this subject. I am most interested in understanding what it is that has Mr. Cohen so scared? Milk is an essential part of a balanced diet and has been a staple of the the northern hemispere foods systems for 100s of years. It would be helpful if Mr. Cohen went to dialogue rather than diatribe.
4,"great, but not what I ordered","Great kitchen item, magnet is just right strength, but I ordered a wooden one and got shiny metal. I'm happy with the product but would give the seller a much lower rating."
5,Does its job,Great product. Does what it's meant to do. Sturdy construction. Just wish it was a lil bit longer in length but not a big deal.
4,Looks nice but not easy to mount,"The value seems good.I like the look as it is mounted.The mounting screws are hidden under the slide-in end caps. That makes it difficult to get a solid, secure mount. (If the screws are loose to let the caps slide in, then the strip wobbles. If they are tight, then you have to drive the caps on; I used a small block of wood but had to be careful not to damage the wall finish.)"
2,Poor quality workmanship,"At first glance, this item seemed of decent quality. However, once mounted, one of the magnets came completely out when removing (twisted not pulled straight off) a knife. Had to reglue the strip with industrial strength glue. The original glue was evident at only three small spots down the inside of the strip. I have owned another magnetic strip for eight years and have never had any problem with it functioning properly. Of course, it was three times the cost. But apparently worth it. My glue job should hold just fine. But I shouldn't have to ""fix"" a new item."
1,don't buy,This product sucks. Difficult to install and overpriced. There are no instructions. The magnet is ok but the design of the product makes it undesirable.
3,"Bad Product, Good Customer Service","Bought this item several months ago. Last month, I pulled a knife out, and one of the magnets followed, detaching itself from the holster. The problem with the product is that the magnet is glued into the plastic holster, which you then fasten to the wall. A large knife with a lot of surface area (like a meat cleaver) pulls the magnet quite forcefully. There needs to be more than just glue, and I'm gonna makeshift a solution into my model (screws or something else).The good thing is that I called Chicago Cutlery and they replaced it free of charge. Didn't even need to mail the broken one back. I'm gonna figure out a way to fasten the magnet in there better, but I'll be careful in the meantime."
5,Why didn't I get one sooner?,"I really like the convenience of this item, as well as how it looks on the wall. I am able to store 2 large knives, 4 to 5 smaller knives and my kitchen scissors. I have put my knife block away in a cabinet, I probably won't use it anymore!"
3,"nic looking, but flimsy","Pro: attractive, strong magnetsCon: mounting system, overall construction qualityThis product has a pair of mounts that anchor to the wall, and the magnetic strip then clips onto the mounts (the black end caps you see in the picture slip inside the hollow silver strip). My experience was that this did not create a sturdy mount. Pulling a knife off by its handle was enough to make the magnetic strip wiggle around on the wall. Also, the magnets themselves were very loosely fit into the silver strip.The loose magnet problem might be an uncommon defect, but I think the shortcoming with the way it mounts is cause enough to look for another strip."
3,OK (its ugly),"I bought three knife racks for my newly remodeled kitchen. Of the three, I immediately decided this one was too ugly to go on the wall. Functionally, its also not as secure as others: the two magnetic strips are thin, so there is not that much magnetic surface area. For me, its best feature is that it is cheap. (But if you are looking for cheap, functional, and a metal finish, get the Ikea Grundtal Knife Rack.)"
5,Best purchase ever for the kitchen!,"Isn't is amazing how one small item can make your kitchen more efficient and pleasant to work in? I love this magnetic strip for my knives. I had purchased the Pure Komachi 2 knife set with block. The block holder they came in was huge and took up way too much counter space. Now the entire set is on this strip, right next to my cutting board and ready for action at any time. They are so easy to remove and replace on the strip. And, best of all, they not only function well, they look great! This is one of the best purchases I have made for the kitchen. Just wish I had done it sooner."
5,Great product,Great price and it looks great hanging on the wall. This thing was a breeze to install and it makes the kitchen look awesome. I would definitely recommend.
2,Won't stay on the wall,"This thing works ok, strong magnet, not hard to install etc. Once it is up though the little tabs on the side will not stay put so the thing always falls off. Not too safe when you are dealing with a bar covered with knives."
5,chicago cutlery magnetic knife storage strip,Chicago Cutlery Magnetic Knife Storage StripFabulous product at a great price. Easy installation. It holds approximately 3 of my larger knives and 4 of my smaller ones. It is just the right size for what we needed and is easily accessible.
4,Work As Expected,"This product hold metal staff firmly, working as good as expect. It could make mounting easier if they give out mounting detail. Or, adding magnet at the back side that make it can be mounted on fridge or microwave body."
4,great quality,really professional item looks and works really good can be used in a regular and commercial kitchen can fit about 10 average size knives
4,Works like it should,"No complaints here, easy to install, works great. Can't beat the price. Not much more to say with the required words you have to put in these reviews"
5,Fantastic product - long lasting,"We've had this storage strip for 5 years now. It works great, it was easy to install, and it holds our 8 of our Henckel kitchen knife collection."
4,works good,I like this product because it holds just the right number of knives for my use over my stove. I did not like the holder that set on the counter.
3,Knife holder,My husband wanted this for his meat shop to hold his knives on the wall. We haven't put it up yet so I am not sure how to rate this yet.
2,Not impressed,I am keenly interested in this topic but this DVD sorely dissapoints. The content is not particularly interesting and the picture and sound quality are not what I have come to expect from the DVD format.Dissapointed.
3,Garbage .... well thats an understatement,"I quit playing Megaman games back at Megaman X3. Not that the games where getting at all bad, just repetitive. X8 keeps it real to the side-scrolling shooting fest. However its far too frustrating. Reason -being all the minigames. I don't know what else to call them. You know how previous Megaman games had a couple of stages where you start off in a ship or something other than the normal routine ? Well now ALL the stages are like that. Sooner or later you'll have to do some petty cheap jump and dodge game. Megaman isn't made for that. He can dash and jump, considering we aren't shooting thats about it. I gave the game an extra star for having tons of cool aspects. But considering the game has no difficulty settings, most will never get to use them."
4,X-citing,"This game has the same 8 boss challenge as the rest, but this time their are 6 characters in total to play as, the 3 maverick hunters with their counter parts the 3 navigators. I enjoy being able to switch off between 2 characters and the voice acting is much better than the previous X7. I've beaten the game plenty of times but I still continue to play it due to the challenge of completing the collection for armors, weapons, etc. It was a pricey game, and a little more than it's really worth, but still a good purchase overall."
5,Best game in the series.,"Graphics still amaze me to this day, people that say this game is hard, just sucks at playing it. Im sure of it."
4,Great fun for MegaMan fans!,"I bought this for my 9-year old son on his birthday. He loves MegaMan and really enjoyed this game. The graphics and gameplay are much improved over the past two MegaMan games. It brings together the spirit of the early games in MegaMan Anniversary Collection with slick 3-D graphics. The only downside is that it is pretty easy in ""Easy"" mode and my son completed the game relatively fast. Other than that, its a great buy!"
5,Great Fast Service,"This company was the best. The item was packaged well, shipped quickly, and communication excellent."
3,"""A good cat. And a pretty cat.""","Data finds himself very worried as he starts experiencing nightmares, but no-one takes his concerns seriously. When a strange discovery threatens the lives of the Enterprise's crew, it seems that Data's dreams may hold the key to saving everyone. But can they figure out what is going on in time?The director did a good job in bringing a dream-like quality to many of the scenes in this episode, and all the dream imagery played out nicely in the real world. But the scene in the turbolift that was meant to be shocking wasn't half so scary as it should have been, and there were too many unanswered questions. There were some good comic touches in this episode, though, particularly those involving Worf, Data, and Spot.One final note: Counsellor Troi got it wrong yet again! And I think they all owed Data an apology for not taking him seriously."
1,Fell apart in one day,"This item is cute; however, it only last one day in the bird cage. I would not recommended. Additionally, it is small."
2,Made in another country,"I am not sure that I will give it to my bird. The toy was not made in the USA, so I am not sure if the materials are safe for my bird to chew on. I am going to throw it away and play it safe."
4,16 forgotten Bob Wills gems from the 1950's and 60's,"Bob Wills / The Country Music Hall of Fame: The hall of fame CD's don't give you the biggest hits of an artist, they give you fine examples of the artist's work that have mainly gone unnoticed or are outside the `hit' years. This is what you have here with their treatment of Bob Will. These are great songs, however, this is not a greatest hits CD. As others on this page have said, this is more a supplement to a different collection of his hits. Four Stars"
5,Burlington Watercolor Paper,"This is the first specialty paper I've used and I am very pleased with the results! When I showed the photos I printed on this paper, it impressed ALL my friends. If you are looking for something to make your pictures more interesting, this is a product that will do it for you!"
3,One of the only books available on Horse Acupressure...,"This book is one of the only works I could find about Acupressure with Horses. The book covers the twelve meridians, accupressure points related to each meridian, combinations of acupressure points related to different diseases or applications, etc.Because it is the only work I found, I am very happy to have it, however, it is largely insufficient as stand-alone work. I advise to start a course on shiatsu, acupressure, acupuncture, or something similar instead of working from books alone.The drawings in this book are relatively poor and locating the acupressure points will not be easy without help. I have the impression this is ment to be a reference for students that participated the courses they organise.Hope this review helps."
4,good introduction,"This is an interesting and well written book on equine acupressure, and also the only on the market! Very clear and simple explanation on TCM (traditional chinese medicine) and principles behind it all.On the other hand, the drawings are too vague to actually locate the points on your horse. They tell you to ""feel it"" but it isn't enough! They give you ""recipes"" of points for different conditions which can be fun to try but may be disapointing if you expect results. In TCM, there in not a pill or recipe for each disease like in western thinking.Overall, an excellent introduction to the subject, but makes you hungry for more!"
3,Great Place to Start,"I have just added acupressure to my equine massage service and this has been a valuable starting point. It is s fast read and not too overwhelming to see if this is something you want to get into. The price is affordable and the charts are great - it is lacking some details I would have liked to have, but it is a great introduction. A more advanced book is needed once you master these basics."
3,Fresh air....,"The unit produces fresh, buoyant air with a minimum of noise on the low setting. Noisy to very noisy on the medium to high settings, but then you would only need to use those settings when called for, such as when I cook. The oscillation option is unnecessary for this unit and it has an annoying click when it snaps back in the other direction. Also, the back panel covering the filters seems flimsy. Still, this unit seems more functional (and less expensive) than many other filters I examined."
2,Too noisy,"This item has a great list of features packed into a reasonable price, so I decided to give it a try. After running it for about a week, I decided to return it because the noise factor was too irritating for me. On all speed settings the tower rattled and buzzed in an unexpected way. The fan inside seemed quiet and smooth, so all I could attribute it to is poor construction of the chassis, which was affected by vibration during operation."
2,Has a weird smell,I noticed the model number listed here on Amazon is BAP1500 however I own the BAP1502 model that I have purchased from my local Walmart. For the most part I have no problem with this purifier which is used in my bedroom. I purchased this to help keep the dust away from all of my electronic equipment. I have owned this product for a little over a week now and the problem is it has a weird scent while operating. I figured this was because it was still new but it has been running for a week now and the smell seems even stronger now than before. I may take it back and get a refund but I am hoping the smell will go away soon.
1,Don't waste your money!,"The only thing that this product reminds me of is a A/C window unit. Yes it is that loud, even on the lowest setting. I have used a Ionic Breeze from The Sharper Image and trust me they are well worth the money. Much quieter and much easier to maintain. This Bionaire actually rattles, shakes and woke me up in the middle of the night. Not a good purchase at all. I wish I didn't buy it."
2,an ok products. but the price is correct!!!,"I was not very happy about thios product. it is an ok product. The price i paius was very very reasonbale. Almost 60% off the regular price.am using in my work. Does an ok job.Thanks,Prem"
5,You'll never go back to your old shampoo,"I have used many types of shampoos over the years, but never one quite like Pureology. Now that I color my hair, I am careful about what products I put on my scalp, and Pureology is the best. It is made from natural ingredients and is super concentrated so that only a dime-sized amount is needed for a full lather, even with thick, long hair. The price many be a bit higher than most, but in the long run, one bottle will last you many months. A great shampoo you won't regret buying!"
5,Great Camera!,"This is a terrific little camera. Because of it's diminutive size, it is easy to carry around. We took it on a trip to Hawaii and took tons of beautiful pictures. I purchased a 128 MB card and an extra battery, both of which I highly recommend. This camera is so much fun, I want to take pictures of everything. And because there is no cost for film, I can! I love it. Chances are, you will too."
4,A sleek and powerful digicam!,pros: very small and stylish. a tough steel case. has USB port. can connect to TV and shoot from there. video playback capability on LCD screen. adequate manual controls consider this is just a point-and-shoot. zoom lens will automatically retract when power is off. very innovative panoramic user interface.cons: no way to turn off pre-flash. no battery indicator. what you see in the view finder is actually smaller. can't zoom when in video mode. doesn't come with a bag. video editing software that comes with it does not quite work.
2,Huge 1990's camera,"Its huge. I got it fr my boyfriend who is a tattoo artist to help document and create his portfolio. Bad idea. I misread the details of the camera and since I had read the words ""camera kit"" in the product title, I figured a kit would come with more than one single object. I recieved just the camera; no battery, memory card, charger, anything. I couldn't even turn it on to see if it worked. I was very pleased with the seller though; he sent me a 2 batteries and a charger for free. I still have to go get a memory card and who knows if they even make them anymore. not impressed. F"
1,No Significant Value-Add,"Why am I paying ..to buy a camera that has the same resolution (2 megapixel) and features (jpeg, mpeg) as the S110 which costs only [less]? I agree it's an upgrade from S100 to S110, but I disagree it's a great improvement from S110 to S300 --- if and only if S300 means ""3 megapixel"", but unfortunately it's not and it's ..extra for those bells and whistles such as zooming and whatever that we don't need."
4,Editorial review,"I find ypur editorial reviews to be craftey marketing ploys to push the sale of accessories. In one case, a negative comment on the S300 supports buying the S100. In all cases, it appears that the same person scripted the remarks which is evidenced by a similar writing style throughouteach and every review.Carl Salanitro Manhattan Beach, Ca."
4,"Great Picture, Convenient but Weak Macro and Flash","Picture quality is good for 2 mega pixels. The picture shot is more on the soft size i.e. not sharp; Depending on your preference, may need do your own editing in your photoediting software.Convenient and easy to use. If below 2 weaknesses are not important to you then it is a highly recommended.Weaknesses: The flash is relative weak and hence meant for short distance. The macro range is relatively long. The LCD is too small to know whether you get a good focus. Have to estimate myself. Only can tell it is out of focus when downloaded to PC and enlarge."
3,Not for those who are looking for real romance,"I've read about some heroes who do some real sleazy things, but this one takes the cake. Having sex with a woman who's been drugged. Wow. That alone made him unredeemable to me. I did keep reading though because I did like the heroine.I will say, someone else called this a steamy read. Yes, yes it is. Anymore steam and I would have been drenched. Not that steam is a bad thing, it's not. But I don't think every conflict between people in romance books can be solved by having sex, apparently that's how these two--more so him--think to handle trouble.Anyway, this book was not my thing."
2,"it started out very good,","But something happens after a few chapters. It made me wonder if the book was written by one author. After the fisrt few chapters, this book totally loses its steam and after that there were just many adventures and some twisted plots. I could not finish this book."
1,Horrible writing!,THis author insults my intelligence. The writing is barely coherent. How did this book get published? I stopped bothering myself at Chapter 2.ZERO STAR
3,Alot of seduction in this one,"Hard to follow at first yet it picked up pretty good as the book moved along. The connection of each of the characters came together better as the story developed. Carolyn Jewel is a great seduction scene writer, actually the best I've read in awhile. I would recommend this book for a quick read"
2,It's a waste of money .,"16 tracks and only 8 songs. The other 8 are excerpts from the movie. If I wanted to hear dialogue from the movie, I would have rented the movie. Instead I wasted my money on the CD"
3,"Overrated, but still good.","I'm more a fan of the film, but still decent tunes on here. Truthfully, these 16 tracks contain just 8 songs, the rest is dialogue from ""Steven Wright"" and others, and amusing just a listen or two. To be honest, unless this is your favorite movie ever, I think you'll find half of these songs annoying, and the only ones I really enjoy are ""Fool For Love"" and ""Stuck In The Middle With You"". The rest have been overplayed to death. I like the ""Pulp Fiction"" disc more, but still only play that once a year. I'll tell you which ""Tarantino"" soundtracks are excellent though: ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""True Romance""."
3,Three songs pay for the record,"It's 16 tracks, 8 songs. Some are great: ""I gotcha"", ""Stuck in the middle..."", Little Green Bag"". Some are awful ""Fool for love"", Coconut"". This is why i gave only 3 stars to it, the fact that it switches your mood when you get to the awful ones, i guess that's what you get when you buy soundtracks."
5,K Billys Super Sounds of the seventies,"What can i say, Quentin mate, you've done it again, this is a great soundtrack and i've enjoyed every song, espicially Little green bag, it's got such a cool funky tune to it, well i must go i have a plane to catch"
4,I love Reservoir Dogs!! I *HATE* that coconut song!!!,This is a great album for anyone who loves the Tarantino film. Really cool dialogue excerpts. BUT I REALLY HATE THAT STUPID COCONUT SONG!!! This CD is almost perfect except for that LOUSY COCONUT SONG!! ARGHHHHHH!!!!
4,GREAT...with a few problems,"I loved the movie, so I decided I had to get the soundtrack. When I first saw the CD I was suprised at how few songs there were, and that is one of its flaws(the running time is just over 30 min.); its other flaw is Magic Carpet Ride: great song, terrible rendition. Too bad the Stephenwolf version couldn't of been on the CD. Anyway, I give it 4 stars due to how excellent the majority of the songs are, but I slightly recommend the Pulp Fiction soundtrack which has zero flaws. Still its good, but short."
5,Awesome,"""Looken for some happieness, but there is only lonilyness to be found"" that is one of the lyrics to a song on the greatest soundtracks in history. This soundtrack is like no other. It contains some of the greatest hit ever such as Little Green Bag, Stuck in the Middle with You, Coconut, and I Gotcha. Not to mention a lot of lyrics from a great comedian, but from the movie itself. If you have seen the movie then the soundtrack will no doubt blow you away. If you haven't seen the movie it will still blow you away you just won't be able to remember what excellent scenes occured when the song played in the movie. So all I have left to say is the lyrics were wrong, happiness can be found right here on this CD. END"
4,Reservior Dogs Soundtrack is unique,"The soundtrack from the movie ""Reservior Dogs"" is a unique one but probably one that only fans of the movie will really appreciate. I found only two songs off the whole CD to be lousy and they're both by the same group, Bedlam. They must have been friends of Tarantino's because in my opinion they lack good musical talent. The two songs that get you're blood pumping the most are ""Little Green Bag"" by the George Baker Selection and ""I Gotcha"" by Joe Tex. I don't know much about either of these two artists but after hearing these songs I'd like to find out more. Of the dialouge excerpts the one that is best is ""Let's Get A Taco"", where Harvey Kietel's Mr. White explains to Tim Roth's Mr. Orange what to do if the manager of the diamond store won't give them the diamonds. Even if you haven't seen the movie it's still pretty damn funny."
1,English-Albanian: Hippocrene Comprehensive Dictionary,"I feel that you have to speak English and Albanian fully in order for this book to be of any use to you. And of course you don't know this until after you buy the thing and if you did fully understand both languages, you wouldn't even need the book. If you only speak English then you'll have my problem, and if you only speak Albanian, would you even know how to look up a word in English?I expected to look up any English word and find the Albanian translation. Well, it does that, but when one English word has so many Albanian words that are related, how are you supposed to know which Albanian word to use. Sometimes it tells you, but usually I find myself flipping a coin. I find this book to be useless"
2,Not For Photo Cards,"I bought this product because I liked the reviews and I like the price. The cards went through the printer fine, but I was disappointed by the quality of the finished product. I print cards using photos that my wife and I have taken. We have used Avery's 1/2 fold matt finish stock in the past, but we were looking to save a little money and bought this card stock. We printed two cards, one on Printworks and one on Avery's 1/2 fold matt finish paper, using the same program, same picture, and the same printer. The difference was very evident. The Printworks was flat, lacked the contrast,the vibrant color,and the color accuracy of the Avery card. If you are looking for cardstock to make photo cards out of I would recommend trying Avery or Hallmark instead of this product."
2,flimsy paper,"I wanted to stick my photos on these to make fold-over note cards. Unfortunately the paper is quite thin/light, maybe lighter than an index card. Not heavy card stock, more like heavy typing paper."
1,3 times the cost is no bargain!,"I was appalled that the price was $15.99; I found it selling for just over $4.00 on another website, and the printworks website says the MSRP is $5!"
5,Enjoyable reading,I enjoyed reading this book. The author interviewed many people for their stories and wrote them down. The book is interesting and fun to read.
5,Good Stuff,"Having only heard this Group once before, I was particularly pleased with their performance especially the track Children. Hope to hear more of the Group."
1,careful,"two mugs in picture, product title states ""Mugs"". Only one is being sold. Deceptive advertising"
2,Should Be Better,"I purchased this book for an overview of Acrobat 6.0. While there is some good info, too much is not explained fully. There are constant cross references ""see chapter 8"", no page reference and the bulk of the book is for the pro version. The author spends a lot of time using fancy nomenclature (not technical terms) instead of offering better tips. I would love to see a Special Edition Using Acrobat from Que Publishing. That series is excellent for learning software. I will look for a better book."
3,"Well, it tells ALMOST everything...","Not bad. Certainly contains a lot of information. It didn't help me figure out how to prevent photo quality loss when sending a file to a print shop (well, it told me why it happened but it didn't tell me exactly how to fix it). However... there are lots of neat tricks and tips for other Acrobat uses. It explained all the options in Distiller and that was helpful. I think we'll get use out of the book at our office... but I'm a little disappointed. It was probably worth the money though."
5,"wonderful, quality product","I used the subliminal program along with the prescription drug Chantix, and I can happily report I haven't smoked for one month. The best part, quitting was pain and stress free. I highly recommend this product!"
1,Weak. Very Weak.,"I am the first one to admit that I love my toys, and while I have mellowed in my old age, I have owned a lot of audio and visual equipment over the years. I was really excited to be getting my first flat screen TV, and figured a product from Phillips Magnavox would be a good one. Well, I was wrong. Let me begin by saying that this TV is only four and a half months old! Major technical issues have arisen in which the TV makes horrible noises and shuts itself off. I looked around online and found lots of other people have had the same problem as well. Then you have to call their technical support, which is just a great way to kill some time before they come back and tell you to take it to a local service center, and that labor is coming out of your pocket. They will however let you know ""how sorry they are to hear that,"" about 7 or 8 times. Not a great product, poor service, not super cheap either. Try another brand, especially if you are going to spend this kind of money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!! IT blew up in flames!,"I bought this tv about 1 year ago and thought it was a good deal for the money, the picture its great with satellite tv, although it did have some sound issues.The other day My 2 year was watching a video and all of a sudden we heard a huge pop saw flames in the back, and then it started smoking and burning. I called customer svc to complain, a supervisor called back the next to apologize and they said they would send a brand new tv, but i am still waiting."
1,KEEP YOUR MONEY!!,"Less than two weeks out of warranty and the screen goes blank. Magnavox tells me tuff, it is out of warranty.BAD BAD BAD product and BAD BAD BAD company to do business with!!"
1,poor reliability,"This is my second one. The first one lasted 3 weeks and started turning itself off. I took it back to the dealer and like an idiot decided to try another one. It worked for 13 months and started to do the same thing the first one did. Magnavox said there were no recalls and I was out of luck since it was a month out of warranty. I don't know yet what it will cost to fix but after paying $1000.00 for it and it lasting only 13 months, you can be sure that it will be the last Philips/Magnavox product I purchase."
2,Bad TV,"Was initially impressed for a while as it had good picture and sound, etc. Then the picture would sometimes go out but volume remain, sometimes there was a picture but no volume, sometimes neither - all of these were resolved by resetting it (unplug it and replug it). It was a pain and I've never had to do that before to any other TVs but OK it was resolved. Then it also started turning itself off a few times. Now the TV has apparently died and probably cheaper to replace than repair since it of course waits to die until after the warranty expired."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED!!! Cases filled against Magnavox /Philips over their power supply and screen issues on these LCD TVs,"I purchased this 32MF231D/37 TV and under a years time it started shutting off after running for 20 minutes and would not come back on unless it sits for an hour. Then the other day I turned it on and there was no picture, no sound, and the green power light keep going off and on. I did some research to see if it could be fixed and found many complaints about these sets with bad capacitors on the main PCB, power supply and screen issues and the whole board going out. The cost of a new board runs about $350.00. See my point??? I could buy a new one for that price. I will never buy another Magnavox /Philips again. Don't waist your money!!!"
3,Cant beat it for the price,"Great TV for the price; calibrate it though, otherwise its way too rich looking. FYI, It DOES have a digital tuner, contrary to what it says above. (ATSC IS a digital tuner!)"
1,"At first great, but pixs went out 1 month after warranty!","I liked this tv a lot.. but one month afer the warranty expires, the picture goes out.. i get the sound, but absolutely no pictures... magnavox indicates that it needs repai.. I take to get it fixed and was told over $600 because display and controller need to be replaced! I did research, and found many similar situations with magnavox on the consumer complaints website... i looked for complaints with other manufacturers and couldn't find as many nor as recent as those listed for magnavox... i do not believe it to be an isolated incident! if you do buy, get the extended service plan with it... I didn't get the repair done and opted to get another TV...."
2,Trouble...,"Seemed like a good deal until I noticed that the HDMI input didn't work. It's been in the shop now for a week. I'm hoping it just get replaced or I get store credit at Circuit City. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for."
4,Good after a rocky start,I purchased one of these from Magnavox through a well known auction site (not e Bay. It arrived with no power cord but they sent me to a service center a few miles form my house and they handed me one---if they had told me that it wasa standard PC type power cord I could have saved the gas.there were problems out of the box. the connections are vertical not flat against the screen. That makes it easier to hide the cables but harder to connect them---especially S Video. The standard picture settings are not that great. I found some suggestions online about what to do with them.The picture actually seemed to improve after a few days. I am happy with it so far.
5,Not Sugar-Coated,"The day I picked up this book, I read it from cover to cover. It gives you a sense of the day-to-day concerns of the young people who are living, for Jesus, in places where they're not allowed to go out at night because of the danger of the neighborhoods, of the people they're meeting and caring for, of the failures as much as the successes, of the doubts probably more than the certainties of Bart Campolo, who directs the ministry. In the final analysis, it gives Christians who are facing much less difficult ministries-of-daily-life feel inspired and, especially, not so alone with the questions."
5,What a gem of an album--a delightful surprise,"A cross between Billie Holiday, Diana Krall and Erykah Badu. Steamy torch songs, perfect for a romatic night, realaxing on a rainy afternoon, or imagining you're in a smoky bar in the 1940s (if the 1940s had a funky twist). I've been an Amazon.com customer for 4 years and this is the first time I have been so overcome by an album that I've been compelled to write a review. I simply can't stop listening to this one."
5,Molly Johnson - Awesome CD,"A friend of mine was driving through Toronto and heard ""My oh My"" on the radio. Back in Minnesota, he purchased the CD and just played it for me last night ... I can't quit singing it and just ordered my own CD. Molly's music grabs you and doesn't let go."
5,When you see Molly Johnson . !! Stop and buy one of the best blues artists you will hear,"I bought Molly's CD thinking well she will be good,Wow I was so wrong.She knocked my socks off, in fact I still have not found them yet!1 lol, This lady is fantastic, incredible and in my opinion a must for you if you love jazz and Blues, I have all of her music,Don't be bored when you see the same compliments from me on everyone of her CD's.She is just flat out GREAT!!!!!!!I am not jiving you about her, Before I listened to her I would have said Molly who if I had heard her name,. Well don't forget, it's Molly Johnson.She will make your day and it's money well spent"
5,South Florida Mosquito destroyer,"Wow! The Dynatrap works GREAT for us! We have a 5th wheel camper that we keep on our lot on Chokoloskee Island in the Everglades National Park. We keep the Dynatrap under the camper and leave it on 24/7. The first 5 days we trapped well over 500 mosquitos. Then we bought the Octenol attractant and placed one in the trap. Over the next week we trapped THOUSANDS! The trap was literally 3/4 full of mosquitos. Yes it does trap other insects such as moths, as do other mosquito traps, but the Octenol attractant really grabs the mosquitos attention! The 3rd week we nearly filled the trap again with mosquitos (I estimate 5,000?). We will never rid our camp of mosquitos since it is in the Everglades, but we sure are putting a big dent in the population in our immediate area! The neighbors on both sides just ordered Dynatraps after seeing our results. Great item for the price!"
2,DOESN'T KILL MOSQUITOS IN NORTH TEXAS,I bought this based on a previous favorable review from another purchaser who swore it worked in North Texas. He must be getting a wimpier variety of mosquitoes where he lives. Does nothing at my house other than killing a few moths and providing an eerie blue night light on my patio. Kind of expensive for a night light.
2,"1/2 a deck, not 1/2 an acre","It works o.k. if you are within 10 feet of it, but we still get mosquitos flying around us, although they do not light. It does not work at our dining table less than 20 feet from the unit and we get bitten by mosquitos. We'd say it works on 1/2 a deck, not 1/2 an acre, and are considering returning it. It does kill everything that gets near it and does not specifically target mosquitos. Ralph Preston & Deborah Thomas"
4,Owned for a year,"I had it for one year. Like other reviews, the product catches all kinds of insects AND mosquitoes. I think it works well for the money and is cheaper than chemicals and propane costs. My original set of bulbs JUST now blew out after all of last season and part of this one. I am buying a second one for the front yard. It's not perfect but was a good value."
3,A design flaw,"The maker expects you to turn this on 24/7 cos' there's nothing to stop the trapped insects from crawling back out. Fortunately, a simple sports use elastic headband (addidas is thicker) will solve 90% of the bugs from crawling back out. But still, how could they not think of this before?Other than this, the unit works very well."
1,utterly useless for mosquitos,"I'm here in Arkansas and the device has not caught any mosquitoes in several days, just a couple moths. I have it inside, where the mosquitos still have no problem finding me, just not this device. The thing must be hoax. Don't waste your money."
2,OK but not great,"I wanted this for mosquitos. I'm not interested in catching moths and other insects, so I removed the lights. Without the lights, it catches few insects. I only need to empty it every couple of weeks. I supposed if I put the lights in, I'd catch a lot more, but like I said, I don't want to kill those other insects. I don't think the attractant is very powerful, if it does anything at all. I used to have the mosquito magnet, which was great. I just didnt want to spend the money for it again. I had it for about 6 years and it doesn't work anymore. That really had a strong CO2 and other attractant and it caught just biting insects. This one is good if you want to use the lights and catch all night flying insects. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,Seems pretty good,"I honestly haven't had a chance to use it consistently, but every time I do remember to turn it on there seem to be at least a few bugs in it. I'm not sure if they are really drawn to it, or if it's random. But either way, those bugs have been caught!The only working issue is that when it's still pretty light outside (or I have my exterior lights on), it seems to attract the bugs less. My other problem is that it's not supposed to get too wet and I don't want to bring it inside everytime it's going to rain, so I had to find a somewhat protected spot to store it outside.Very little noise!"
1,This cost way too much and did very little to trap insects.,Cost way too much. Did very little good. It was a waste of money. I would not suggest that anyone purchase it.
2,Pretty much like others.,"I haven't found much of a decrease in the small mosquitos that bother us. In fact, they congregate near a corner of our house just a few feet away from this unit and don't seem to be attracted to it at all. There are plenty of moths being eliminated, but those aren't my targets."
1,Simply does not work for us - at all,"We purchased this and the indoor version. Neither attracted the mosquitoes we have on St. John, Virgin Islands. It seems that we have at least three varieties - including aedes aegypti. The traps may work somewhere, but the mosquitoes here did not even randomly get trapped. It's as if they avoided the light. They are well-made and attractive. They just don't work."
2,will catch some bugs,"We have used this for several months (spring through fall) and while it trapped some bugs, it didn't do much of anything on the mosquito population."
2,"Robert M. of Granbury, TX","I have used the Dynatrap DT1000 for approximately one month. I purchased it to eliminate mosquitoes from my small patio. It is totally ineffective for that purpose. It does attract and catch moths, some beetles and other small flying insects but it does NOT attract or catch mosquitoes. I have been bitten by mosquitoes while standing within five feet of the Dynatrap. They will instantly fly to me, but not to this ""trap."" I might add that I also purchased Flowtron Octenol Mosquito Attractant and used the attractant with the Dynatrap. It did not seem to help. If you are buying this product to catch mosquitoes, I would recommend some other device."
1,We're still getting bitten and this has caught nothing,Our poor toddler is still getting bitten during her sleep. This product has done nothing and I'm going to see if we can still return it. It's been on in the bedroom at night for the past couple months and I'm up at 3am writing this because we've all continued to get bitten several times. We even had this running outdoors during a BBQ once right after we ordered it (for several hours) and it caught zilch!!
1,Do not recommend,This item did not work at all in long island. Completely useless and inreturned it within 30 days. Definitely a waste of money. May have to try for a higher priced co2 item
2,"moths good, mosquitos not so much","I got a lot of moths,but not many mosquitos. It is difficult to empty & there are a lot of escapees. NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED!Bulbs don't last as long as one is led to believe. Rating 21/2 stars."
2,Dynatrap Insect Eliminator,Dynatrap does not trap Mosquitos as advertised on the label. Mosquitos were my main motivation for purchasing Dynatrap.
5,no more bugs!!,I got tired of contuosly changing propane tanks so I figured I would give the Dyna trap a try. I works great and no more propane expense
1,.,"This does not work. Don't waste your money. Now I am in the process of sending it back, which I am glad I put the charge on my charge account, because it has a dispute department."
3,I don't know?,"I spent the morning setting up a pole with electric. Then I read the directions! ""if used outside it must be kept in a covered area""..well I don't have a covered area. So I spent the rest of the morning putting it back in the box..My daughter has a covered area ma bey she can use it.."
1,Doesn't work and breaks quickly,I bought this hoping it would help my bug problem. I didn't notice any difference in the amount of mosquitoes. In two months the bulb broke so now it is useless. I don't recommend this product.
2,not worth the money...,"we had hoped this machine would help with our mosquito and ""li'l biter"" problem, but it has not helped at all...we have followed manufaturer directions, moved it around, etc., and all we have sucked in and killed are tons of moths...virtually no biters.....harrumph!"
2,Works great but the bulbs go out after short use,I purchased this product based on the reviews here. The product worked well for over a month and it was fun to see what was caught each week.But now both the bulbs have blackened and no longer work. The warranty does not cover bulbs and I'm extremely disappointed with the short life span.Looks like this will sit in a box till I find another product that does not require such bulb expenses
3,Moth Catcher,"We've had the unit for about two months. It attracts lots of moths and june bugs, but it hasn't really dented the mosquito population at all. I was worried that it would attract beneficial insects, but there are very few lady bugs or other beneifical insects inside. It does reduce the number of june bugs flying around the deck so we keep it on."
4,Works well. Don't expect too much.,"Some of the reviews above seem to think that a bug trap should be a miracle worker as soon as you plug it in. After installation, I still saw mosquitoes flying around, but over the following week, the mosquito population dropped about %90. We still have the occasional skeeter, but not like it was after Tropical storm Bonnie. The build quality is a bit flimsy and light, but it does work. Please understand the following:1. The bulbs will burn out one day. They sell them on Amazon.2. It is very light weight and somewhat fragile. Follow the directions for set-up.3. Do not expose the unit to direct rain.4. Don't expect miracles. Give it time to work.5. You will likely nee an extension cord.6. Hanging is fairly easy as it weighs very little. You will need to provide the hook."
3,Works well for a few months.,"I have bought two of these. They work very well for a while, but the ballast dies after a few months and there is no replacement available. Consider this a disposable product. There are cheaper traps that work as well."
2,Great for first month-then died!!,"I have had the Dynatrap 1000 for a month. I left it on continuously and it worked great on our mosquitoes in South Georgia. After a month, the fan stopped working. I did what the manual instructed, but no luck! I tried to contact the company and still have received no reply. This is disppointing. My neighbors were going to purchase one....but not now."
4,Works as advertised,"Works like it says. Bugs are attracted to the light, so it doesn't work during the day or at dusk when the mosquitos first come out. Only effective at complete dark. It definitely cleans up on the little guys as well as catching other nighttime bugs such as moths. Works in the woods . . . should work great in a backyard too."
1,Good at getting rid of moths,I put this up in an area that has a lot of mosquitos and all I caught was a lot of moths. I tried it at night without the bulbs on and didn't catch anything
1,The Dynatrap Insect Eliminator Costly ineffective gadget,"I, like several suckers, got fooled into buying this useless gadget. It caught hundreds of poor moths and that makes it eco undesirable.I never saw a single mosquito. Two months later, the light blew out. I wish I had never wasted my money. I hAVE NOT USED IT SINCE THE LIGHT WENT OUT.I am so angry and disappointed."
5,Big pile of dried up bugs!,"We bought this as an alternative to the propane traps (which I hear are expensive to operate and aren't the most effective.) We love the DynaTrap! At first, it was hard to find a good spot for it (it can't be in direct rain and needs to be hung ideally, 6 ft. off the ground) but once we switched it on, it was like magic! The instructions say to empty it once a week, however, we are getting so many bugs, we are emptying it about 2-3 times a week. We bought two of them, one for each side of our house and now, when we are outside around dusk, we rarely get bitten! I highly recommend this product."
1,A bummer!!!,"I am upset, disappointed and downright frustrated with this useless piece of junk. I called the company for help since I thought I must be doing something wrong. I just cannot believe the positive reviews here!! I have followed all instructions, I have tried it with the bulbs and without, I have tried it on the ground and 6ft. above, I even put in a $20 Octenol lure. The thing has been running day and night for a week and the bugs STILL prefer me. Mosquitoes are flying about all over the place, I was bitten six times yesterday. Going outside is like entering a war zone. WHY IS IS NOT WORKING FOR ME?"
1,Bulb burned out in a week,I have had this unit for one week and one bulb has already burned out. It works well but I don't intend on buying bulbs on a weekly basis. Very disappointed
2,"It works okay, but...","The lights don't last long at all. They're rated for 4 months, but they didn't even last one. Lame."
4,Dynatrap is a killer!,"Last year, our neighborhood was miserable with a new kind of mosquito which bites even during daylight hours. This year, my mom decided to try the Dynatrap Eliminator and she has been very pleased with the results in her backyard. She will shut the unit down for a day before emptying the trap into the trash, just to make sure all the little buggers are dead. It's made her backyard much more comfortable."
3,not bad for the price,I saw this item in several magazines for about $119 t0 $140. It was easy to set up and it is a lot quieter then my old bug zapper. I have a stream that runs through my back yard. I get a lot bugs during the summer. I have had running for about two weeks now. The large container is about half full. I don't see myself emptying it out ever other day. It is very easy to clean.Over all the price is good and it is a well built unit. The unit is easy to care for and works well. It also consumes less electricity than a regular bug zapper.
4,helpful,"I live in an area infested with mosquitoes and sandflys (no-see-ums). I bought this as a low-cost alternative to the propane using traps which cost more than a $1 a day to run. I ran it for three days and nights. It caught many more moths and beetles than mosquitoes or sandflys like the other reviewers say, but it did catch them. There were almost no bugs caught durng daylight so I hooked it up to a timer and had it come on at dusk and off at sunrise. It caught just as many and probably saves light bulbs and power. I have my doubts about the Co2 claim but the light does attract bugs. I don't like the fact that it does not kill all the bugs which means you have to carefully remove the cage and put them in a plastic bag with some insecticide to dispose of them. It would have been a better design to have a net bag attached."
5,bugs,This product seems to work great. we heard about this from our daughter in green bay wi. She read about it in the paper. She has a woodsy backyard and loves the product. We had a mosquito magnet for the last two years and it was expensive and a hassle to run. My husband was the only one that could make it work. We have orderded from sharper image before and had excellent results.
1,Disappointed,We were told this would work for flies but have caught only one small fly in 4 weeks. All we have really caught is a bunch of moths (and they don't really bother us) The company (Builder Depot) wants to charge us a 20% restocking fee plus hold us responsible for shipping charges to us and back to the company.
1,mosquitoes arn't interested,"I placed the Dynatrap at the suggested height.I left it on 24hrs a day.The moths are attracted to it,but very few mosquitoes get trapped Would I recommend this to a friend?NO. 100 dollars would pay for alot of repellent and citronella .If I could get a refund,I would gladly return it,if not I guess It will go to the dump. It is a waste of electricity."
1,Disappointing.....VERY,Sorry to say I was sorely disappointed. I thought I had found the answer to flying pests in my barn which is serious and ongoing problem for my horses. The reviews I read raved about the effectiveness of this product online and in magazines advertisements by Frontgate. And since I consider it a very reputable site I ordered the product from Amazon since they had the best price. HOWEVER....rethink this purchase unless moths are the pest you are focused upon.....flies and Mosquitos were never in the tray upon emptying and the product was hung outside the stall. Nothing of what I expected...waste of money!
1,Motor quit after a month,"Seemed to help until the fan quit. Verified that there is voltage going to the fan, no binding, but no fan."
2,Attracts everything but mosquitos,"This unit catches at least 200 insects a night, but maybe 10 are mosquitos, and the balance is small moths and incests that are not a problem. I used the lights and attractant. My unit had a 6ft cord, not 10ft.The unit is hanging under my deck with a good line of site across the backyard. It does need to be located under cover,and not be exposed directly to the weather.I bought the unit 6/25/2010 and I just missed my chance to return the unit in the 30 day return window offered by Amazon.There was no information on where to put the attractant. I placed it under the fan base in the trap area. I will place the next packet by the lights and see if works any better, since I cant return it. I will continue to use Cutter Backyard hose spray insecticide every few weeks to try to keep these Georgia mosquitos under control"
5,great product!,this does work very well. we have wetlands behind our house so you can imagine how much we need something that works. this does work very well. we have had it for over a year. we had to replace the bulbs this year but that is about it. my husband also found some little added things to put inside that were sold this year to assist in luring them in and that seems to be working too. great product that actually works
3,DynaTrap bug catcher,"When purchasing the Dynatrap, we were hoping to catch more than just moths. I have noticed fewer mosquitos, which is what I wanted to do, but when emptying the DynaTrap all I see are moths."
5,"Solid clarification, even for the VERY LOST.","For all those who thought they had substantial mathematical skills and overall capacity for learning chemistry (and realized they were sorely mistaken by the third lecture), THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. I am a reasonably intelligent person and a really good student, but my ego shrank to infinitesmal proportions when I tried chem in preparation for medical training.Goldberg's written word sounds like you're sitting in a lecture, only clearer. Don't give up, just get the right way to learn it. Goldberg's writing is a good start."
2,Lost me very quickly had to buy another book,"I bouht this book first, lost me by chapter 3, bought homework helper for chemistry or something like that... Much better book!!! I'll try and use this book some how, later once i understand it more...gg"
1,Major let down,"I was very disappointed with this book. I agree wholeheartedly with the other review. Honestly, I thought it was outdated and had some extremely tacky, and frankly, stupid ideas. All of the graphics were handdrawn. Major disappointment!"
5,Desktop Keyboard Drawer,"I love the Desktop Keyboard Drawer! Its made strong, not like the cheap one's on the market. I went everywhere looking for one like this and had no luck. I have one for my other computer and love it! Thank You!!!Pat Thomas"
3,"Problems, problems, problems","I bought this model, because I liked the idea of the air quality center. Unfortunately, the air quality center didn't last for two hours, LITERALLY, before it just stopped working. I called the company and they sent another air quality center and paid for the shipping and handling. That one lasted for several weeks. Called them again and they are sending out another one (free shipping and handling). However, it's been about a month and I have not recieved it. When the air quality center is working it is the greatest thing. It controls the air purifier's speed according to the amount of particles it detects when it does its scan. I just wish it had a longer shelf life. The purifier functions without the center. Buy the unit without the air quality center (save a little bit of money) or take your chances. I hope you have better luck than I have had."
3,It works but is cheaply made,My condo underwent a major construction project that kicked up a storm of EFIS exterior dust that contaminated pretty much everyones homes causing twice-daily dusting duties for the not so Type-A personalities and worse for us Type-A's. I bought this to help keep the air clean. It did a great job but it is very clunky. The access door to the filters wouldn't stay shut. It needed to be taped and it rattled loudly. More tape used to silence it. I expected a far higher quality machine for this price.
5,Hepa Filter,"Excelent product, works great, you can find any speed you need from silent to full speed. The price is fantastic for what you get. I have an extremely large home and I have bought two, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. I intend on buying more for my office."
2,Dont be cheap! pay the money and het a different one,"The wireless function is the coolest thing, but as an air purifier its ok it works for a small room, but is worthless for a medium to large room. I found it is worth paying more for a different brand, because they clean the air better.I wouls buy this again for a small room only."
2,No SUPPORT by M-Audio,do not buy this product - the company does not support 64-bit OS vista or XP and would rather make you buy new hardware despite 64 bit OSes being the future. check their user forum - many users agree the lack of support is totally disappointing. I have a $200 paperweight.
4,Good Reference But Not For Beginners,"If you are starting out with HTML/XHTML, you might be advised to get a tutorial. This work appears to begin with basics, but even the early chapters provide much more information than a novice wants or needs. (The ""Links"" chapter--Chapter 4--for example, describes all types of links, many of which a beginning web page author probably won't need to know about until he or she has acquired quite a bit more experience.That said, this book is a good reference with lots of helpful tips. It may not be as complete as other reviewers hoped, but I have found it quite handy for learning many advanced topics. And, although the edition I have (the 4th) has been out a couple of years, the material is still mostly uptodate. In short, it is a very good resource."
2,"Hardly Complete, but a Good Reference; In retrospect, it should be 3 stars","The book is a good reference, but I wasn't happy at the time, that certain browsers and operating systems were left out - the ones that have been growing in use for the past 5 years. For example, a chart of major Browsers lists several outdated versions of Internet Explorer and even Opera, but forgets about Safari - no version of this browser is listed. If you believe the computer world begins and ends with one company, this book is for you. If on the other hand, you are interested in open source, Apple, and others, it leaves much to be desired as a ""complete"" reference. However, it's still a very good reference tool, especially if you use programs like Dreamweaver and need the code to fix rendering problems. I use it often."
5,Is this college material?????,This book makes Code easy to read and understand-i`ll be writing it in no time..... Should forever change my computer skills.....
2,There Must Be Better CDs Around Than This,"I didn't like this CD. I did a more extensive review of another CD by the same author.I did a more extensive review of this CD too, but Amazon didn't post it. Was it because I thought, maybe, with a CD, you might pause before you had someone (who might have been subject to CSA) be mindful of all of the sensations (memories) in their pelvis?"
4,Good historical view of witch trials,"The author, a historian, obviously spent a great deal of time going over old records, letters, and anything he could find to gather information about Brain Gunter and his daughter, Anne, who was ""bewitched"" according to the accusations. By doing so, the author provides an encompassing view of the life and times and beliefs, and also explains how many people so easily accepted witchcraft accusations while others maintained their skepticism. All witch trials were not like those at Salem."
3,"Heavy on Heritage, light on explanation","This is essentially a dual language Russian/English survey of the last eight hundred years of Russian poetry, from the Lay of Igor' to early post-war period. There is no explanation of the context or stature of the various poets, and the poems selected are not among the best from particular authors in my opinon (Blok, Akhmatova, Tikhin, etc.) but there's not a lot out there competing, either. Russian poetry is very moving, classically structured and lyrical. This survey doesn't really do it justice."
4,Creating Russian Memories,I purchased this for my adopted Russian granddaughter so that she may have some history of the writings of her homeland. She loves poetry so feel the book with its Russian expressions will give her joy.
3,Pretty Good,Okay I admit I don't have the CD. But I have listened to all the songs a million times on the internet and at my friends house. Anyway this CD is pretty good.But a little grown up for some younger adiences. So I would recommened it for 14 and up. The best song on this CD is My happy ending.I think her first CD was better and more appropiate for younger adiences. But if you want to buy it. Buy this CD!
1,Inappropriate and unhelpful,"Written in cartoon format, I thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight, dry, biography of scientists. However, it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids. The cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known, so using it as an initial reading is impossible. Further, some content is offensive. On the second page of cartoons, a scientist is walking along a bridge, thinking, when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump, saying, ""No woman is worth committing suicide over."" The pictures show a scantily-clad woman (with bare bottom in one frame) that he is now picturing in his mind. Irrelevant and inappropriate! Plus, I didn't have to go far to find swear words in the captions. Yikes! My kids will never see this book! It is not even appropriate for high-school age kids. (In fact, it isn't even funny to adults!)"
3,Fun But Flawed,"This paper is great for projects, simple to use, and inspiring. My problem with this product is that the transfer cracks after a few washings. I wouldn't recommend it for t-shirts or any fabric that gets thrown in the washer/dryer frequently."
2,non-washable plastic transfer,"This basically glues a plastic sheet to your shirt with your design printed on the plastic. Wearing it feels like you might imagine it would, and it doesn't survive washing very well, even if you wash it by hand very gently. The directions tell you to iron it for much longer than it can handle. If you do as you're told, you'll burn it."
2,"OK, but","This was my first use of the newer style T-Shirt Transfers (my old ones were 5+ years ago). I liked the fact that they transfer WELL, almost Perfect. Color is great. What I did not like is it feels like a garbage bag stuck to the shirt, and after 2 washes started to wear."
2,GOOD AT FIRST,"I was so excited about these. I didn't have to waste any trying to figure them out. They are very easy to use. The pictures turned out great. (see customer images). Unfortunately, they don't wash well AT ALL. The first wash, they cracked up and now they look terrible. I washed them in Dreft on cold inside out and didn't even dry them and they are now Aweful! I really wouldn't recommend these. I am going to try the dark color ones since they have better reviews."
3,iron on transfer paper,"The Printworks t-shirt transfer sheets are a bargain (about $1/sheet)compared to other brands. I recommend it for small graphics, ie ironing on a little logo. You can fit many on one sheet, then cut them out. For a larger graphic that takes up the whole page, you end up with a big ""plastic"" print on your t-shirt. You also need to put a lot of pressure and heat (and time) to ensure that the transfer really ""sinks"" into the t-shirt fibers. That will minimize the plastic feel of the transfer."
1,Disgusted-Do not buy this.,"This is the first review I've ever written for a product ever. I was prompted to do so because I think that this is worst product I've ever purchased. I have used avery t-shirt transfers for many years, they're not the greatest but they usually hold up to a couple months worth of washes. With this product I was pleased with the way the transfer printed and transferred and everything still would have been fine until I washed the shirt found the image disintegrated after 1 wash in cold water. My many hours of work designing, printing, and ironing are all wasted not to mention the sad look on the face of the little boy I was making the t-shirts for. I will be returning this. For the few extra bucks you save it is not worth it, you will be sorry."
1,Peeled off after first hand wash,"I have made iron-on t-shirts for years with great success. Yes they do wear out fast if you use a washing machine. I only hand wash cold, inside out. I just used Printworks for the first time (they were on sale). It printed easy, ironed-on very nicely but when I washed it for the first time and let it air dry the graphic peeled off! I never had that happen before! Maybe it is bad quality paper, I don't know but won't buy it again."
5,Great for Hypertufa Projects,I have used this to mix with my hypertufa mixture in making planters and small garden sculptures.The sculptures have held up incredibly well and I believe it is probably due to adding this to the mixture forstrengthening the bond.
2,Fragile,"I wish the camera reviews could include drop tests likethose done for computer laptops.Because of its metal casing just like for the Canon S10/S20,all the shock from a minor drop is transferred to thecamera lens and interior. As a result, a 3ft drop willdestroy this camera."
4,What's with this great battery life?,"The disposable AA's that came with it were dead after about 20 shots at highest resolution and the homereplacements were about the same. This camera should be run on three sets of rechargeable 1600 MAH NnMH - one set in the charger, one in the camera and one on standby. I concur with almost all of the other reviews"
1,Beware!,"This was the 1st digital camera I bought (after looking at reviews for a year!) In the end I just couldn't find the camera that had everything I wanted so I decided to buy a 2MP camera just to get started, and then a higher MP one when the one I wanted came out.It was a huge disappointment, for 3 reasons: (1) it makes skin tones look brown all the time, and pictures need massive desaturation in Photoshop (sometimes up to minus 35!!); (2) the photos seem to be not quite in focus; and (3) when taking macro shots, you never know what's going to be in focus.On the plus side, the Canon interface is a joy to use and the computer software is very easy also.I returned it after a few days and bought an Olympus C-2100UZ, which is giving me exactly the pictures I would expect from a 2MP camera."
5,Love at first snap,"Saw the ad, checked it out on dpreview.com, bought it. Took less than an hour to set it up, take 35 pictures, install the software, download the pictures. Took pictures that were supposed to be the camera's weak points - low light indoor pictures (poor focus) and some at max flash distance (~12 feet). Everything came out perfectly. Love the focus, the flash, the speed to focus and the lack of delay once you push the button to actually snap the picture. Simple to use yet it produces amazing results. Plenty of advanced features should you decide to use them. The included Photo Stitch software allows you to stitch multiple exposures into a panorama view. Minor limitations: only supports USB downloads (no RS232 or firewire), all photos stored in JPEG format (does have choice of 3 compressions - normal, fine, superfine) and finally the zoom lacks fine control in that it always zooms further than I'd like. All in all a terrific value!"
5,Another fantastic feature,"One other feature of this fine camera has not been mentioned - Image Stitch. I have taken a number of panoramic image sets using the stitch function. Canon software which comes with the camera stitches the images together and creates a panoramic view. The resulting file can be saved in various formats including jpeg and PICT, but also can save it as a Quicktime VR file. I have taken a number of 360 degree photos. I love this versatility. This easy to use camera has the right combination of file size, image quality, ease of use, and versatility. I have been very happy with the purchase."
5,Great Small Canon Powershot,"When my granddaughter lost her digital camera I looked around and did a little research on a replacement. This is the camera I came up with and my grad daughter dearly loves it. It is easy to work , easy to carry and very lightweight. The picture quality is very good.She loves the 3X zoom lens. Even after weeks of heavy use the case still looks new."
3,Canon Powershot A20/A10 Manufacturing Fault,I bought Canon a20. And I m really satisfied with its result. Outdoor result is outstanding and it really give natural colors indoor result is slightly dark.. But when u uses manual white balance its good. Alkalinebatteries give good backup time if you didn't use LCD screen. But I suggest to buy rechargeable battries.a biggest fault which I find in it is that it didn't give u the accurate focus on optical finder. Means if you focus a specific area and when u takes a snap of that u get a wide area result.I don't know what'stechnique behind it. but if you use LCD for focusing something then it gives u accurate result. Focus is really good and I also use MACRO mode it's also fine. Panoramic Features are cool but I am trying to get 360 digree picture with it. if anyone of you know technique of that then pls tell me. The only fault which I told u it gives me problem sometime.
5,Excellent color accuracy.,"This little camera is great. Easy to use, light weight, decent zoom, and excellent color accuracy. It is a battery hog, but at least you can pick up AAs anywhere.Invest in rechargable batteries and a larger compact flash card, such as the Viking 128mb. A card-reader isn't necessary, because the usb cable can download dozens of pictures in a few minutes.The Lowepro D-Res 10 AW Digital Camera Bag is the best $... you will ever spend. Small, well padded, and has room for the extra batteries you'll need to carry. It fits the camera perfectly. I bought it based on an earlier review said that with this bag, ""you could throw the camera out the window."" I have had absolutely no reason to toss the camera, but snuggled in it's bag, it has survived being dropped in parking lots, banged around climbing rocks, hiking, etc.I have been very pleased with this camera and would recommend it over anything else in it's price range."
4,Perfect for rafting,It is very lite weight for anything that requires a weight limit. I would have given it a 5 star rating because they could have created a place to strap it down on the bottom.
1,Gross,"This movie was about as anti-Christian as you can get. It actually mocked Christianity. And it did it all in favor of pushing a pro-gay agenda. It champions gay men to are married cheating on their wives. It says a lot of about gay relationships in the one scene where the one character says something like ""enough of the mushy stuff let's f***"". It was graphic and just disgusting. I turned it off. I don't even understand the point of this movie except more liberal propaganda."
1,Gay for pay gone bad,"Like many who rated this movie I, too, was looking forward to a comedy not based on the ever popular coming out melancholy or the self hating pray the gay away routine. Instead, we got a whole lot of bad acting and even worse chemistry. Ick. How do I get my money back from the cable company?"
1,LOST MONEY,"I ordered this film, and waited about a week before opening the package and watching the film, and to my surprise, the film has skip in it throughout the whole film. Due to the return policy, unable to return.Would never order from this company again."
1,Warning : 2 great actors does not equal a great movie,"If only I could have passed on this one. Jim Carrey, while not my favorite actor, has done some great stuff over the years (Truman, Majestic, Yes Man) and Ewan McGregor is solid and talented. Why they chose to do this film is beyond me. Supposed to be about white collar crime. Maybe I expected some kind of intelligent sticking-it-to-the-man heist or something. Instead, they were sticking it to each other. I was pretty put off by the rampant homosexuality, but beyond that, the movie is just dysfunctional and depressing. There's no character to like, most of the time they are in prison, and it all ends very badly. WTF ? I guess I should have researched it first - I thought that two talented actors at the top of their game would make an amazing movie together. Hard to imagine who this would appeal to. Very disappointing."
2,I Love You Phillip Morris,4 12 12THE BOOK PUBLISHED SOME YEARS BACK WAS PROBABLY BETTER THE FILM IS AN AMAZING STORY WHICH WOULD NEVER HAVE PANNED OUT LIKE THIS IN EUROPE. THE US PENAL SYSTEM IS A VERY HAPPHAZARD BUSINESS AND A GIANT TRAP WITH MORE THAN 2 MIO. PEOPLE IMPRISONED. THE FIGURES ARE ABOUT 80 PER 100 000 PEOPLE IN EUROPE ARE IMPRISONED AND IN THE US IT IS 10 TIMES THAT - ABOUT 850 PERSONS PER 100 000. PEROSNS.IT IS NOT A SYSTEM ANY EUROPEAN WOULD WANT ANY CONTACT WITH.
3,Sporadically funny but if only I knew what to make of it.,"Jim Carrey was the singular reason I watched this film. The problem with this movie is that its not really a comedy, its not really a con-artist movie, its not really about gay relationships. It does all of these 3 things in somewhat equal measure and then loses out overall. I liked bits and pieces of it but too many times lost interest and was left with the feeling that if the director had focused on making a good con-artist movie, Jim Carrey could have turned it into something spectacular."
3,I Love You Phillip Morris,"Generally entertaining, but a mixed bag. The script: at times hilarious, but then veers into obnoxious Coen-esque caricature. Carrey: at times even touching, but also riffs on tried-and-true shtick. The 1 constant is Ewan McGregor, an actor whom I like well enough but have never been wild over: here he steals every scene he's in. He's just perfect as suthun' belle Phillp..."
5,Romcom for people who hate romcoms,"I hate romantic comedies. I feel like they manipulate your feelings, and are overly formulaic. That said, I really enjoyed this movie. The characters motivations and actions were believable. I was pleasantly surprised by the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Granted, this was based on a true story, but there was some fine acting bringing the characters to life. Definitely worth watching!"
2,An embarrassment and offensive movie for gays and AIDS patients and victims,"Hmm, I have an idea...let's make a real-life movie where the lead character is a total gay liar and in the end, we'll completely make a mockery of those who have, and have died of, AIDS. Are you kidding me?? This movie is kind of funny and very touching at points but there's way too much vulgarity and sex than was needed. The ending (his final lie) is such an insult."
2,Interesting Story,"When I read the title of this movie, I thought it was a movie about a cigarette company, along the lines of 'Thank you for smoking'. Reading the description on the outside did not tell me much about the contents of the movie.This movie is about a love story, between two men. Also it is about the escapes of a con man from a prison so many times, and the life in prison. In most other movies about prisons, the gay people or new guys to the prison are beaten or raped, but this movie is different and seems like they are accommodated nicely.I liked the story line, and the various adventures that they go through. But the gay love scenes were a turn-off for me. It is not the type of movie you would want to watch with your girlfriend, unless of course you are a girl. :)"
2,"I had expected more humour, something to really laugh at!","I was quite excited at the thought of a ""very humorous"" gay story, however, by the time I had got about half way through I just turned it off. Ok, so my sense of humour is different to what they advertised."
3,Alternately funny and heartbreaking,"Evidently at least some of this was based on real events that took place mainly in Texas. A con man falls in love with an inmate, springs him, and keeps ending up in jail over and over because he cannot just stay on the straight path with a decent, honest job. Carrey and MacGregor are very convincing as the couple in this odd comedy that is sometimes very sad."
4,A real gym and surprise hit!,I hadn't heard about this movie until a friend told me about it. I ordered it and really enjoyed watching it. Once you got passed the premise and into the love story it really captivated you.
3,Bonking Nicely,"It seems, this movie is based on real personages who themselves care much less of their affairs than producers did.Father of a young daughter left family and job for police behind to be himself that is a top at some stages demonstrating nicely as one could suggest, artist's copulating skills.The rest is satire on the US both judiciary and penetrating system a prototype serves a life for his tricks with while movie-makers are looking forward to new cinematographic awards, perhaps."
2,really a movie that doesn't know what it's about,"i'm a big jim carey fan, but he's been in a rough patch. this movie can't figure out what kind of vibe it's in and doesn't tell a good story. good have been more successful in better hands, but doesn't hit the right notes, the chemistry is never there, and it's lost between a comedy, a drama, a doc... who knows. Explicit where it should be implied and subtle where it should be graphic... a miss."
1,I know that this movie is GREAT but...,Unfortunately the movie I received from Hong Kong did not play in the USA. I lost the money and have a movie I cannot watch. Now I am waiting for the movie to be released in the USA to buy it here AGAIN.
4,A genuine love story,"What appeal to me the most to watch this movie is Ewan McGregor/Phillip Morris...He is so adorable and I thought he did really good job in this movie. I'm not a fan of J.Carey but I think he suitable potraying the con man. There a few thing impress me in this movie: Good story line (Oh, they are so lucky everything going well for them despite the fact that they living their live in prison); good script and cinematography and; Ewan & Jim did a very good job in this movie."
5,got to see,i love this movie it was very gay. but in a good way if you kno what i meen. its funny sad and a prison break movie. all i got to say is Jim carrey is awesome in this movie i give it a 5 out of 5o and if you dont want to see it bc its a movie about 2 gay guys dont let that stop you im as str8 as they come and i loved ittake it ez guys and i hope you like it as much as i did
5,Portman reigns like the princess she is,"This book is great! Portman fans will adore this book, because Dickinson has really done his homework. Her life is so inspiring.and the pictures are phenomenal. After watching star wars, I wanted to learn everything about her, and i could not put this book down."
1,Shame on you Mr. Dickerson,"I was really disappointed. A lot of the book is based on speculation about her background and no one knows for sure what is fact and what is fiction. The author seems to have some sort of obsession with the young lady and her sexuality and her apparent envy of another child star Britney Spears because she (Britney) became famous before her. He gives absolutely no evidence for his reasoning and it reads like a tabloid magazine, and really it's quite creepy that a grown man would dwell on it so much. He goes on to say more than once what a noble thing it has been that he has waited so long to reveal her real name, that by not doing so would go against freedom of the press, yet it's confusing to the reader because he apparently has only been aware of her for a couple of years. I literally feel guilty and sick for buying this book and supporting this guy. It's highly disrespectful to both Natalie Portman and her family.Shame on you, Mr. Dickerson. Shame on you!"
2,Dickerson lacks authority...,"I found this book to be nothing more than a high school-level book report on magazine articles and newspaper clippings. The fact that Dickerson himself admits that he hadn't really taken an interest in Natalie Portman until the year 2000 shows that he does not speak from any privileged vantage point. He is not privy to any special information about Natalie that would draw any intelligent reader's attention, nor does he offer any keen insight into things that even the most casual fan of Natalie Portman's would know through pop culture and the media. The fact that Dickerson fails to get substantial information from those closest to Natalie proves not only that he is irresponsible, but he lacks authority to speak on Ms. Portman as well."
4,Great Book Overall!,"This book was fantastic! I enjoyed reading it, it gave great background information, and the descriptions of Natalie, her history, and her career as well as her many films were vivid and wonderful. I also liked how the author provided so much info on Natalie's ancestors, and after reading such an awesome biography of the best actress of our century, I liked Natalie a lot better than before. There was hardly anything wrong with this book at all, except for the fact that James L. Dickerson left out many parts of Natalie's early career, her childhood, and how it felt for her to have been discovered. He also made the mistake of how old she was when she had been discovered. In an interview the actress said she was eleven when discovered. But the book was still great!"
5,AWESOME!,DX Ball 2 is the second best arcade game that I have ever played (the best being Strikers 1945)! I would rate the game itself 4 1/2 stars but the music was so good that I gave it a five! I recoomend this for anyone that likes classic arcade games. And for people that do not... It's worth a rent!
5,My Favorite,"This game is the most awsome, fun, & spectacular game I've ever played. At first I thought DX-ballz was but then I played this...it was awsome the graphics, music, everything: it's an incredible game."
2,Misleading Title,"When I bought this book I expected the lead character to be chased by a mob of fortune hunters. Instead she receives only 2 offers of marriage- both from old friends who had to be almost bullied into asking her. The story is mainly about the actions of a French spy and a British lord's attempts to have the English military take him seriously. I was really dissapointed. The title of the book should be ""The Eager Spy""."
1,"Unappealing hero, not very interesting plot","I disliked this book mainly because the hero was a womanizer, and only a few pages from the end of the book, he is getting ready to make love to his ""fancy piece."" He changes his mind, of course, when he realizes that it is really the heroine that he loves! Where is the romance in this, I ask? There was little explanation for what the hero and heroine saw in each other. The story started out so slowly I got bored. I tend to like Evelyn Richardson because some of her books have good plots, and well-developed characters. This isn't one of them. I would recommend that you read her ""The Bluestocking's Dilemma,"" rather than wasting your time on this one."
2,Only One out of Two Glow Sticks Worked,I bought three deluxe sets which inclued two glow sticks in each set. I only tried cracking 4 glow sticks so far out of 6 but only two worked. One from each of the two sets used. Disappointed!!!! The two that worked looked great.
5,MPB -,"Renato Vargas gathered all the good voices from Brazil and made this collection of CDs ""O Som do Barzinho"". It is only him and his guitar, singing the most beautiful songs from a variety of MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) singers. In addition, the audience follows and sometimes leads the music. An awesome CD for those who loves MPB like me."
1,0 stars is more like it...,"Pieces of junk plastic. Should heeded the advice of the previous reviewer. CD drives can't see that media in drive. Tried on three computers and same problem. Call manuf., no help and no answers. returning for refund."
3,Decent for Price,"This fan is a decent fan, for the price anyways, the first one i got never worked right, and when i sent it back to get another one, the ""new"" one i got wasnt always that great either. its a deal if the price is right..."
5,If you are considering buying this game BUY IT!,"This game is seriously amazing. Although many people may not ""get"" this game(because its not call of duty derp)for those who do,it will probably end up being one of your favorite games. If you are looking for a unique and amazing game experience,look no further than here."
4,We are in a tight spot!,"Killer 7 is very different from many other games out there.It is both stylized and very, very, very bizzare.Basically picture RE4 with psychotic laughing enemies and getting upgrades with their blood.This is not for everyone do to the fact that not that many people, like me, who like these bizzare games.If you are not that way, give this game a home!"
4,PHUN GAEM,"THIS GAME GOOD. CASE SMELL BAD. SMELL LIKE FACTORY. NOT ORIGINAL CASE. NO SCRATCHES ON GAME. PEOPLE STAYED TRUE TO WORD, IT WAS LIKE NEW.ACTUAL GAME FUN. PLAY AS MANY DIFFERENT CHARACTER. JUST AS THE TITLE SAY. IT SEVEN KILLERS. YOU DON'T KILL SEVEN PEOPLE THOUGH.SUDA51 MAKE THIS GAME. HE BEAUTIFUL AND MAKE GREAT GAME."
1,craptabular,"i dont even have it but it is so retarted. my friend has it and thinks its amasing, even though he dosen't understand it. i tried it one and i want those few minutes of my life back."
2,Poor quality and support from LG,We have had this DVD player for 5 months with light use. It will not power up and LG wants $69 to look at it. This is a poor quality product that the company does not stand behind.
4,Pleased,"For the smaller (40"") LG tv its a perfect match.Connected with HDMI, good picture, remote not too small!When I push open there is a slight delay before it does, otherwise no problems."
3,So nice they did it twice!,"Look very carefully at the track listings for this CD. Notice that the first twelve titles are replicated as the second twelve titles? Think this is a typing error? THINK AGAIN!While disk two is intended to be a 6-song EP (at least that's what the cover says), it's actually a replica of disk one. Bummer! What's going on here? Hard to complain, or even return. It is, after all, exactly what's advertized.Apart from my feelings about being swindled, the 12 songs (on either disk) are hardly on par with earlier material. Hence, a double whammy. Save your money, and listen to their old stuff."
5,"""A must-read for all church staff""","Ernest Zarra's book clearly addresses the dangers of not screening those people who work with children and youth in the churches. It contains vivid examples of what can possibly go wrong when a church has no system in place to screen those involved in the ministry. Zarra's book provides such a screening program. This book should be read by all ministers, and the screening program contained within should be implemented as soon as possible. The safety of the children depend on it."
5,"Works fine, no driver needed","As I would expect, I never needed to take the CD out of the box, it worked with the default drivers with no problems."
5,Just what I wanted,"I had a really old MIDIMAN 2x2 for composition when I used exterior samplers and tone modules. Now The samplers are all in the computer, so I needed a device that would simply connect up a trigger keyboard. It worked as anticipated.."
3,Not True to Size,The shoes are beautiful but they run small. With this brand I could have went a whole size up.
5,Wonderful shoe,"The shoes are super comfortable and they go with everything, I bought them for my mom and she loved them. The height of the heel is perfect. She got a lot of compliments from them."
4,Mix A Galaxy-Class Starship,"with a bunch of nodes,add holodeck problems (including the captain and Data nearly being smushed by a train engine)add a pinch of weird ship-wide happengs and you've got...Emergence. On the whole, quite a funny episode. You've got to enjoy seeing all the really, really different holodeck characters that pop up, especially the conducter. Other good points are with Data handling traffic issues. While the main plot was maybe be a little on the crazy side, I enjoyed it and appreciated the enviroment of the train with our 24th century heroes."
2,Great effects do not a great Trek make!,"Yeah, the visuals are stunning, the costuming is, forgive the pun, ""fitting"", but this has to be the dumbest ST: NG episode, next to ""The Royale"" and ""Devil's Due""."
4,Poetic Language without a Plot,"My Professor advised us to read this book without looking for a plot...because we wouldn't find one. He was right: Hyperion is a beautifully written account of one man's reflection on his life; it deals with love, friendship, and man's relationship with Nature. Holderlin's personal love for the Ancient Greeks also resonates throughout the poem. It should be read to enjoy and to be used as personal reflection on one's own life as well; but if you're looking for a plot, don't bother. There really isn't one. Pay close attention to the selection of poems included in the back: some of his better works have been included, and they are printed alongside the original German version as well. German scholars may find some discrepencies in the translations."
3,Disappointed After the Hype,"This book was a pleasant read. However, after reading other reviews in the newspaper and here on Amazon I was disappointed. If you are looking for a book on the writing life I can think of many others with more substance."
3,"Good design, too small for overnight use","Very stylish, nice blue glow in the dark. It automatically shuts off when the water is out, and it stays dry when not being used. It is however too small, and the mist doesn't go very far hence not quite enough for personal overnight use. If this is the only humidifier you'll own, it will not be enough."
5,Amazing!!!,"I can't stop watching it!!! Great graphics, sounds, softh and beautyfull timeline and story line. Is great!!!"
3,The Proper Begining Finally!!!!,"Well it's about time, these episodes are the correct begining for DBGT, I don't know why they released it as Lost Episodes, [My guess is that there is only the DBZ movies left, so they are trying to milk as much as they can for this series] because on the first DBGT disc there is a little quick summary episode of what happened before that discs 1st episode. It's very confusing, I was really exicited that DBGT was released on DVD and was disappointed that it didn't begin as it should have, cause there was a bunch of episodes missing. I first watch DBGT way back in 98, where the episodes were bootleg and subtitled on vhs. I was not real happy on the new installment of Dragon Ball, but once I started collecting the dvds, I really got into it. I will be adding this disc to my collection."
5,I love Take 5,"This Single is da bomb!! I love Take 5 so much!! Buy this single now, you wont regret it!!"
5,I luv Take 5! This is an awesome cd!!,"Hey Stevie, what's up? I miss you. Come back to Minnesota please. I luv Take 5 and I can't wait for ""Jack of All Trades"" to come out so I can go see you every week. My friend Hayley says hi to TJ. C ya guys later =)"
5,Great! A must buy! I give my money for it!,"This has great harmony and the catchy song that rings in your head all day. So buy! buy! This is a need in everyone's collection of CDs. if you like *N Sync, BSB, Aaron Carter or No Authority you are sure to like this."
1,I can't find the CD,Hey you all. I just heard of Take 5 but I can't find their CD. How can I find it in a store near me?
3,I feel a bit out of place with the other reviews,"The product description and inside flap intrigued me, and the other reviews seemed to rave about it. The info seemed to describe exactly what I was looking for... inspiration for my own art. But I found it stuffy and boring. Maybe I'd built it up a bit too much in anticipation of its arrival. I think 3 stars is fair."
1,99k?,"First off, why is someone trying to sell this game and a few other for nearly ten grand? And second, this is a horrible game and should be in the 5 dollar range, and even then that's expensive. If you want to play a videogame with a decent Nightmare Before Christmas gameplay, pick up Kingdom Hearts or its sequel instead of this garbage."
2,No More VHS Tapes!,"The first tape will not play, I realize it's and old VHS tape, but I am disappointed that it didn't work."
4,tiger balm liniment,"Thought I'd try something new. Works, but for me not as well as original red creme."
3,Why does this continue to be unavailable for Kindle?,"This item has remained ""unavailable"" on the Kindle for quite some time even though a price is quoted, Why????????????????????? My understanding is that Greene's film writing is quite good, but I simply want to buy it on the Kindle but it always says ""not currently available"" and I simply do not understand what this means."
3,Box? What box?,"This item is being sold as ""Hoppe's Cleaning Kit for Air Rifle and Pistol with Steel Rod and Box"". OK, I got the steel rod, but the only ""box"" it came with was a plain cardboard box many times larger than the components.The kit didn't come with any cleaning solvent. Luckily I had a bottle of solvent in my .22 cleaning kit; the barrel of my air rifle was filthy.The cleaning rod is adequate, but it lacks a handle. The rod is uncoated steel, so you need to be really careful with it or you'll damage the delicate rifling. I'd have rather had a brass or coated steel rod.On the positive side, it comes with a nice, solid brass jag; most cleaning kits I've seen come with flimsy plastic jags that bend or break after a few uses."
3,Low to mid grade cleaning kit,"I bought this to clean a couple pellet gun rifles. Being prior service, I believe in keeping my equipment in top operating conditions so I might be a bit more overzealous than a 'casual' pellet gun owner. I think this kit is intended to get you a basic start and have you purchase additional cleaning adapters.Pros:InexpensiveSimple to use and effective but may need more adapters to get the job done wellCons:The handle does not rotate to compensate for the rifling in the barrelThe wire brush that it ships with could use more bristlesThe cloth patches are a bit small and do not hug the barrel when sliding through (I use at least 2 per ram to compensate)"
3,Marginal,"This kit is just marginal in quality. I tired to buy some .17 cal brushes for it on the Hoppe's site and could not because the site does not work as it should. The female threads on the brush are not standard so nobody else carries these brushes, so once the brush goes, so does the rod. I should have bought a ""Dewy"" rod in the first place instead of being a cheapskate."
3,OK,"This kit is OK. I got both this one and the Gammo. The Gammo is better. Aluminum vs steel rod, brush, and more patches/cleaning pellets. Get the Gammo."
5,Thief,This party shipped me out of date CD's that won't play on today's computers. When approached they did not reply. I feel no one should deal with this seller
2,Uninspired and uninspiring,"This ""narrative history"" is essentially a short textbook, not the sort of book one would read for pleasure, unless one finds pleasure in being bored. While it is a good overview of the historical development of of the UU religion, it is written in a dry, workmanlike prose that doesn't engage the imagination at all.As other reviewers have noted, the book dwells on the Unitarian strand and gives the universalists a briefer treatment. The final piece, on the creation of the Unitarian Universalist Association in 1961 and its evolution since then, is also cursory.I will keep this on my shelf as a reference, but I doubt I would ever feel a desire to read it again without it being to look something up.A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalismis a much better introduction to UU."
5,hard to believe this hasn't been reviewed,"I don't have any history on this band, I borrowed this to listen to from a friend. This band is a classic balance between ""decipherable"" death metal vocals and goth oriented rock. The musical journey takes you up and down between metal and rock interludes with plenty of creative side trips into fast and moody tracks. Overall, it's very creative and kind of mesmerizing, as good goth/metal rock should be.i would recommend it."
4,What an interesting look into the author's thoughts.,"My first book of poetry. Having not read any since my days in school, I entered the cover a little apprehensive. I fully expected it to be boring, and too deep in metaphors and meaning. To my surprise I found the poems interesting and rather enlightening about the life that Mr. Borgmann must be living. I red the entire book in two sittings. There are many sad, and truly emotional moments. I liked one in particular 'Nonchalant love affair', that one caught my attention."
5,Awesome! Classic Country! A MUST BUY!!!!,The 14 songs on this CD are what country music was meant to be. even if you already own all of these songs you need to buyt his cd just to have them all in one place.
3,"using netflix rating ""liked it""","Simple and direct, the actor talks about Jesus with intelligent use of props. I recommend watching it - but don't take it word for word. For the complete gospel read your bible."
3,"Decent book if you need direction, not if you want specifics","This is a good book for undergrads who aren't aware of the possibilities within a major in one of these fields. It is also good for anyone who doesn't hasn't begun to narrow down prospective graduate schools. However, if you already know what you wish to purse in grad school and which schools offer your program(s), I strongly suggest you look elsewhere! I found the information provided was basically limited to the same thing I could get on their internet site. Not only that, the CD ""in-depth"" descriptions are nothing more than general program information (the same information you can email the graduate offices for). I was looking for a book with more detailed information on admissions for individual schools. I suggest Guide to American Graduate Schools."
3,Pretty good.,"All in all, good shoes.A little disappointing that the seams began to split open in different places after only one week of use."
5,New Balance Men's walking shoe MW965,I purchased these shoes for my husband and he loves them. The look of the shoe and the comfort in wearing them are all that he wanted in a shoe. He would buy them again.
2,"A picture book, with little information","This ""QuickSteps"" book is largely a picture book: lots of nice, color screen shots of various parts of the Outlook interface, with sketchy text captions pointing to various things to tell you what they are and do.There's not a single scrap of information in this book that you can't find from doing a quick search in Outlook's own online help. And because of ""QuickSteps"" relatively thin size (compared to most software manuals), it gives you only the most superficial introduction to the topics it covers.My advice is to skip this book -- even at the ""amazing low price!"" as it claims right on the cover -- and use the Outlook online help and tutorials. Then if you still need more information, get one of the real books."
4,"very nice, but......","Very nice pendant, but I wish it would have been larger. Hard to tell from the description and picture. Otherwise, a pretty pendant."
2,Britannica 2006 cd,"Very difficult and confusing to find exatly what your looking for.I had encarta encyclopedia from a few years back and it was very easy to use, especialy for my 2 kids."
4,As cool as even Chet gets - Highly recommended!,"This is a great CD to snuggle with your sweetheart by. Very comfortable. Nice arrangements. A few of the string arrangements duplicate the 'Chet with Strings' CD, but lay out well within the tracks here. This was recorded in '59 during Chet's first stay in Italy. His voice is better than the 'Best of Chet Sings' CD. This is one of Chet's 'clean' times... so everything is as good as he gets. The one drawback on a few songs is a concert hall (or big bar) acoustic/echo effect. Other than that, This rates as one of my favorite Chet CD's (and I have 30+!)."
5,Great Paper! (Print On Both Sides),"This paper is fabulous for printing calendars, or flyers. Colors are rich and the type is crisp (using an Epson printer). One of the other reviewers mentioned that there are watermarks on one side, but there are none. Both sides are plain white with no markings. Burlington made a similar paper years ago and this matches, or exceeds it."
2,not what i wanted for photos,first off this is advertised as photo paper when its just regular computer paper but thicker. there is no gloss or finish whatsoever on this paper. then depending on what you are printing you may be able to see through the paper to the image on the other side and the paper may wrinkle if the image needs alot of ink. so its thicker than regular paper but still not thick enough. it has little value for me especially at the price it costs for advertising two sided photo paper. i intended on using this paper as the cover for pamplets im making but now im gonna have to buy a better quality paper and try and find another use for this paper.
3,Duex es machina ending,"It's not giving away the ending, but you should know the ending is WAY too pat. I ended the book with, ""you gotta be kidding me."""
2,"Interesting Subjects, Poor Writing","Yes, some very extreme methods are described here. But, being lowered into a pit of dung and having a shaman shove more into your ears, nose and mouth?There are numerous other exciting activities described. I've done firewalking and board breaking among others and thoroughly enjoyed it. To a great degree it seems we owe Tolly Burkan for this.The premise is to break through fears, mind over matter. Excellent and empowering concepts.I suppose it's a good thing to have someone exploring all these various avenues.But walking on broken shards of glass, allowing an object to pass through your body? Sounds like a traveling show or some sort of magic trick.It's a good thing they put a disclaimer at the beginning of this book. Don't try this at home, kids."
3,"Simple, But Worthwhile","Extreme Spirituality is a simple read. Each chapter is short and about a practice that heightens spirituality, such as: firewalking, piercing, skydiving, fasting, etc. Though it doesn't really go into depth about any of them or try to explain how they work, it does open the mind up to possibilities and perhaps encourages people to challenge their fears and preconceived notions."
5,Exactly what I ordered,"I ordered 4 sets of this flatware. It arrived in perfect condition. I would've liked for it to arrive sooner, but I think I have become a product of the NOW generation! It arrived packed really well in a timely manor as promised."
4,Ramses good not great,"Ramses the Great has all the advantages and disadvantages of a programme produced by the History Channel. It is a well-produced programme, that gives a good over-view of the life of a well-known character from ancient history and this over-view is driven by narration from world-renowned experts on this period of history. However, it does force these experts to make statements about motivation and feelings for which they have no evidence (and which must embarrass them). These, however, were an advantage for me because they led a group of 15-16 year olds to discuss the methods and motivations of the historian and the problems of the lack of clear evidence for much of the ancient world. I would recommend this, but advise the viewer to take it with a pinch of salt."
5,LEARNING ABOUT HISTORY,THE MOVIE WAS VERY INFORMATIVE. IF WHAT TO KNOW ANYTHING RAMSES. THIS IS THE MOVIE TO WATCH. MY FRIENDS ENJOYED IT.
3,Ramses is pretty good,The dvd did a good job of assessing the life of the Egyptian leader Ramses II. In an hour you get a general overview of his life.
2,Poor Design,"This knocker is very attractive looking and matches my other Antique Brass hardware, however it I was very disappointed in the way the unit is installed. Two long 8-32 screws are inserted into two very shallow threaded holes in each end of the unit to mount the entire knocker. It really needs two long internally threaded studs that would accept screws from the other side. The screws are longer than required so you have to keep filing off a little at a time but if you go too far you're screwed. The screw only fastens with a couple of threads so there's not any leeway. Very poor design."
4,Good paper at a great price !!,I use a Canon photo printer and based upon all of the reviews that I have read it is generally suggested that you stick with the same brand of photo paper as your printer. As an experiment and because of the low price I decided to try the Burlington Glossy Photo Paper. The appropriate paper settings are included in the box for your brand of printer. I followed them and found that I got prints that were as good as on the Canon Glossy paper. The paper is a little on the thin side but about the same as the Canon Glossy paper. Canon Glossy Plus and Pro paper are thicker. As an everyday paper I was really happy and surprised with the results of this paper.
3,Blue Cast to Prints,"I wrote a review on this paper and liked it very much. On more detailed side by side comparison with Canon Glossy Paper, the Burlington paper has a blue cast to the images. It is OK for casual printing but I would stay with my printer's brand paper for more critical work. The printer options are more precisely balanced for their paper type."
1,wrong track list for this cover,"I bought this item from a marketplace seller. They sent me the item pictured with the correct CD but Amazon has the wrong track list listed for this album cover and corresponding CD.As of 4/15/11, Amazon has been notified that the track list for this album cover is not correct and they have not changed it. This is actually a badly remastered compilation album by Johnny Paycheck put out by LaserLight.The original 1977 version of Take This Job and Shove It by Johnny Paycheck is highly recommended to anyone who loves JP."
5,Essential North,"Davidson takes the reader on a journey through time, circling the globe in a dizzying display of erudition. He narrows in on a conception of the North like an explorer seeking the pole, with stopping points to reference seemingly every mention or depiction of the North in the history of literature and art. Ultimately the North is too expansive to be encompassed by any one idea, and Davidson's wide-ranging method serves as a sort of calculus, approaching the North without ever really reaching its limits, leaving intact a bit of the awe, mystery, and magic that has always attached itself to any imaginative account of the North. This is essential reading for anyone interested in the literary conceptions of the North and all of its metaphorical and metaphysical characteristics, and would make a great travel companion on any excursion into the North."
1,not this one,I did not enjoy this at all. Poor filming. Poor acting. Poor action. This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
4,Interests my 2 year old,My two year old loves books in general but some capture his attention better than others. This one does a great job of engaging him in the pages especially the page where the little boy laughs while the sink overflows and the page with the train filled with good things to eat. The illustrations seem to be captivating for him.
5,Great Digital Camera,This is the best digital camera that I have used. I have had the camera now for 14 months with great success. We purchased the camera when our child was born. We have taken around 600 pictures so far. We put the pictures on the web and email them to friends. I think the real advantage of the camera is the quality of the photos. We have printed alot using our color printer and they come out pretty good even at 8X10 size(very old printer). We have also had alot developed through Shutterfly and other developers that you cannot tell the difference between those and other 35mm photos. We even compared pictures with a friend who had a 35mm photo of basically the same shot and ours was better....Buy the camera you won't regret it.....
5,Simply Amazing!,"I waited in anticipation for my purchase after intense reviewing on the internet. I am so impressed with this camera. I also purchased an additional 128 mb compactflash card. The ""package"" that I purchased from Amazon included an 8 and 32mb cards which I will store in the included case for backup.The quality of the photos blows away any photo that I have taken on my 35mm. Your first mission should be to try the macro mode. The detail is great.I am now hooked on DIGITAL...anyone want to by a used 35mm?"
4,Excellent book for serious readers.,"Big Java is designed to get the reader up and programming with essential objects by Chapter 3. If you genuinely want to be a legitimate Java programmer, this is the book for you. It is well written, examples are carefully thought out and very helpful."
5,Great book.,"This book is excellent for anyone wanting to learn Java. It has great examples that actually work, and it teaches in an easy to learn manner. It covers a wide range of topics which would take you from beginner to about the high edge of intermediate. I have read many Java books before this, this book is very well rounded compred to most, and in my opinion has offered the most knowledge thus far."
3,tough to read,"I am only a novice. While I have read several other books on Java; I did so very rapidly and without really trying to work out the problems. When I read ""Big Java"" I find myself going to other books (e.g. Sun's Java 2 Language Manual; Complete Javaver. 2, etc.) They just seem easier to comprehend -- more straightforward. Mr. Horstmann omits a lot of detail-- he ""elides"" many code snippets.* When I get through the book, I'll probably love it; it's a class text and I can't avoid it's use. For now ... arrrrrrgh!Billy Hess* In case you're wondering ""what the heck?"" it means to use an elipsis(...) in place of ..."
3,"give you the concept, but indirectly!!","this book is definitely a HARD read for beginners. It took me quit a while to understand the concepts and codes presented in this book, because the author omits a lot of further explanations on many examples. It wasn't until I had to look up on line or refernce to other java books that I could finally understand the concepts that the author's talking about.He's a very INDIRECT guy...so to wrap up, if you are somewhat exposed to java or have some basic understanding of it, this book should help you out quit a bit. if you are a beginner like i was, no, i will not in a million years recommend this book to you. Lastly, if you are already an ""expert"" or intermediate programmer, this book should be in one of you collections. since the author's just pointing out the big pictures, but omits the detail works, this must be a great REFERENCE book."
4,pretty resourceful,"i like this book only because i have to. I really don't like the class that I am taking that requires this book. If you have to take a java oriented computer science class, this is the book to use"
1,Doesn't work with Vista!,"VERY old software version (can't believe they still sell it!) which won't work with Window's Vista. If we can dredge up an old computer running 95 (are there any left alive?), maybe we'll get it running. I should have read the info better!!!"
1,Do not buy if you have a new computer,We bought this program and it doesn't work in any of our computers. We have a Mac with Intel processor and our this does not work in our version of Windows. Complete waste of money.
1,very dissatisfied,"I am a speed cuber and i bought this spray thinking it would make my cube even faster. I use a diyan speed cube and i applied this, then it stuck. It discolored the plastic and made the cube unmovable. i think it might have dissolved the cube as well. i had to wash my cube and now it is moving like it did before."
1,Warning: Do not use on plastics!,I bought this lubricant specifically to fix a stuck / squeaky key on a laptop keyboard. Unfortunately the lubricant discolored the plastic on the keyboard. It was my (incorrect) understanding that silicon lubricant was safe to use on plastics.
4,Good product overall,its good and all on Rubik's cubes but i have noticed the plastic actually turned sort of a white color.
3,Meh,"I haven't had a use for it yet. Alls I know is that I looked up cubing silicone and Amazon pointed me to this. So I bought it. And sprayed it on one of my tougher Rubik's Cubes. And it melted the plastic. It says clearly on the can that it isn't meant for plastics. Way to go, Amazon! I know that's no fault of the manufacturer's but it was a little disappointing. Anyway, I'm not sure the quality of the product because I've not had to use it for anything else. And don't know what I would use it for. Why would anyone use this when they have WD-40, amirite?"
4,top fits kinda funny,"cute costume, bottoms fit well, top fits, but the elastic could be a little tighter, you need big boobs to stay in it without popping out of the bottom."
1,this costume SUCKS!!!,What a waste of time and energy ordering this piece of *(#&$*&^%! The fit was horrendous making any figure look odd. There was a tacky bow under the neckline that looked ridiculous and the fringe was coming off on all four ends of the vest. Don't make the same mistake I did in ordering this.
3,J P Knapp Bio,"As a longtime researcher and now author of the new book The Knapps Lived Here, I became aware of this bio 8 years ago. Most of the facts are correct, but there are some errors, the worst one being a photo published of a young Joseph P. Knapp that IS NOT HIM ! It is not even an member of J.P. Knapp's family as he had a son Joseph F. Knapp, who journalists often get confused by. It is actually Edward Kiely, who was Joseph F. Knapp aka Dode Knapp's personal secretary."
4,Haunted memories,"I saw this film 18 years ago, and it still haunts my memories. The film is itself about the way post-war Germany has been haunted by the memories of its Nazi and World War Two past. It follows the story of a mother and her daughter as they struggle through the last years of the war and the immediate post-war years. The mother is raped by a Russian soldiers among bombed-out buildings and ends up carrying her small daughter on her back through miles of ravaged countryside. They struggle on to achieve a fairly comfortable new existence after having been refugees. Then the father returns and turns out to be a patriarchal tyrant. The most haunting scene is the final one in which the little girl stands outside the locked bathroom and knocks, calling out 'Mama, Mama' while her mother is inside, attempting to commit suicide. I won't tell you what happens after that: see this film."
2,Long and Slow,"The first half of the film gives a fairly interesting snapshot of pre-World War II Germany, with a mix of politics, romance and familiy life on the homefront. Later, a more existential and abstact film emerges, as the characters seem to degenerate into quirky, eccentric, boring and unlikable types. Because it is also draggy, you need to watch this movie on 2X fast forward and follow the closed captions--not difficult to do and saves about an hour of your viewing time."
4,"Very good, for what it is","This is a good product. It's economical, and it works great with my Epson Photo 870. Be careful, though - it's at its best when printing bold, colorful graphics. For photos and other detailed images you should use a coated card stock, like HP's."
3,greetring cardstock,"pretty good product..i am always searching for cardstock, in bulk...so this was a good find...just wish it was a heavier weighted paper...i was afraid the ink would seep right thru! it didn't!"
4,Make a LOT of nice greeting cards,This is a very nice set of paper and envelopes. The price is really great. The paper is a little lighter than the ones that cost almost double. The colors come out very bright and the folding is easy. Overall it is a good deal.
1,No so good,Have been unable to program to my 2003 Windstar. Have requested to return & for what ever reason have not received an RMA.
1,almost great,"The product, a charger for camera batteries, does the job charging the battery, but it was supposed to also perform as a direct power source for the camera. I can not find that feature on the device. I am still satisfied with the functions it has, but I am disappointed in the representation."
5,Wonderful product,"Love this product, it made my frizzy wirery hair soft, sleek and managable. I am sold!"
5,my hair never felt so soft.,When I first saw this product I was a skeptic. But after just one use my hair was soft and shiny and had lots of fullness (not bad for baby-fine hair).Definitely try it...you'll love it.
5,best ever,"I was uncertain about this product but after using it even the first time I am sold on it. My bosses boss even commented the other day on how nice my hair looked! Buy it, you'll love it!"
2,Read Ingredients,Propylene glycol is known to exert high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during degradation in surface waters. This process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen aquatic organisms need to survive. Large quantities of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycol.
4,good product,I purchased this peoduct along with the shampoo. I liked this product and I would purchase it agsin. I did not like the shampoo and would not purchase the shampoo again.
1,RIP OFF,"Buyer beware1 The one star is because of the vendor rather than the product which is excellent. RIP OFF! I believed that I was receiving 16 oz of the product rather than 6 oz that I received. I actually paid the price other vendors, including Chaz Dean, offered for 16 ounces. I certainly won't use this vendor again through Amazon or anywhere else."
2,Average conditioner,"WEN has nothing new with this product other than another ""average"" conditioner. Suave or Vo5 conditioners are actually better at cleaning/conditioning your hair as they have the chlorides essestial for ""clensing"". Wen has too much ""guck"" in it. It builds up on hair.When I used this product my hair was ""heavy"" and dull. You don't need to spend so much or use as much if you co-was with vo5 or suave. I actually discovered how great these inexpensive conditioners were. I have always used expensive conditioners thinking they were what is best for my hair and tangles...I have thin, dry hair and much of it. I have used Biolage conditioning balm as my favorite..since I have gone with co-washing (no shampoos) vo5 is now my favorite. Comb glides through effortlessly and does as good if not better than Biolage or WEN."
4,"my hair is shiny, but does not stay clean for mire then a day!","Have been using for a few months.. If I do the procedure the right way, my hair comes out great.. Got compliment the first time....Seems though, that I would need to shampoo more often using this product...I do rotate and use regular shampoo sometimes..."
4,Great product depending on your hair type...,"If you have normal to thick hair, this stuff is great! A little goes a long way. If you have fine hair, this is not for you. It will make you hair look oily instead of clean and full."
5,Great styling product,I love love love this product. Only use about a nickle size dob on clean damp hair and scrunch it. Have lots of loose curls and doesn't go limp!!!
5,Good Product,"I an a black woman and I like to wear my hair natural. Over the years I have tried every product I could to controll my hair. I think I could have bought a house with the money I've spent on hair care products. Thank goodness I did'nt give up and tried this product. Finally I have found a product that works for me. It mositurizes without a sticky or oily feel. My hair can be touched without coming out with a hand full of oil. Its soft and shinny and moisturized. All this, after only one week. Love it!"
3,ok,i think the same result could be accomplished with any nice conditioner.it emulsifies the oil on your hair so you can rinse it away with hot water - but you've got to use a ton -and the stuff is not cheap!if you have curly hair - you will still have frizz if you only use this as your styling cream.not a bad product - but not really what chaz claims it should be.
3,A step too far!,"when i first received this product i was excited. i thought that i could get rid of some of my other hair products. to my dismay it didn't take long before i had a thick gunky buildup that made my hair appear dull and weighed down. maybe i used to much. i can't really say, but i do still use the wen cleansing conditioner every day as a leave in, so this product become expendable!"
4,great lightwieght product,"I got the styling cream with the cleansing conditioner. I LOVE the styling cream. I have short/medium length bobbed hair. It is fine and has a tendency to be flat--especially when it gets longer. The cleansing conditioner was nice, but I didn't notice the dramatic change I was hoping for--but my friend with long wavy hair has had amazing results with it. I think since my hair is healthy and on the shorter side it didn't have as much of an effect. But the styling cream is great. It gives me volume and body without weighing my hair down, and it doesn't give me stiff hair. I usually don't even put in any products, but this is one that I don't forget to put in!"
2,It flattens my curls!,"The first time I used this, my hair looked great- my curls were perfect and without frizz. But after a few uses, it seemed to weigh my curls down and straighten them. :( I tried different styling products (including Wen) but still no improvement. I do like being able to use this one product in the shower, and it smells good and cleans well. Not sure why it doesn't like my curls!"
1,A lot of hype but disappointing results.,Don't waste your money on this product. There is a lot of hype about it because it is sold on QVC but I have found many different brands that work better than Chaz Dean products and are much less expensive.
2,Not for curly hair,"I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial. I have naturally curly hair and I'm always looking for products that will give me frizz control without weighing my hair down or making it crunchy. This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don't have oily hair). It also left it twice as frizzy, regardless of which products I used after washing. My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.The styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!I think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product. It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn't control the frizz. I can't recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair."
1,Works great (but only the first few times),"This is such an interesting product because it worked ok for me but ONLY the first two times. From the third time on, it felt like I had build up in my hair and made my hair dull looking instead of shiny. This build up made my hair feel stiffer than normal (not sure if this was because the product dried it out or if it actually stripped my hair of natural moisture, I could not tell the more and more I used it. I still have some left over, and I use it to shave my legs. I have to say, it works great for THAT!Maybe it depends on the type of hair you have to start with. Mine is naturally curly and is color-treated at a salon once a month to cover grays. The infomercials say this is for ALL HAIR TYPES, so I don't think that is really a true statement. I could see it working better for people with fine hair that is not damaged in any way. Another con - for the amount of product you get and the amount of PUMPS you have to use, this stuff is expensive!"
2,wasn't as good as implied by the ad,"I used this product for two months with the cleanser and can't say that I was real impressed. My hair is thick, curly and color-treated. It felt clean and soft but was still frizzy on the lower third of my long hair."
5,Smooths down the fly aways better than anything else,"I have used this for a gel, but I really like to use it to smooth down the fly aways after I am done styling. I love the scent and after I smooth it in, I fluff my hair and it shines. Makes my hair smooth and silky."
3,Its okay I guess.,"First of all, I watched the videos on the Wen website, to make sure I was using this correctly. I have long, fine, wavy hair , and work out daily , sweating a lot. I WAS just rinsing out my hair 5 out of 7 days a week , using a conditioner the same way as Wen , and using shampoo only a couple of days out of the week.Honestly, I am not crazy about the way my hair feels after I use this. It feels soft , and clean...but a strange kind of soft. Like soft wool, or cotton ball soft. Odd. It does not feel strong and silky , just kind of a squishy soft. I have been rinsing it out really well, and even stopped putting the extra on it for a leave in...but the strange texture continues.This may be great for certain types of hair, but not for mine.For the money, the results I got were just not comparable to what I was getting doing the same routine with my Nexus Pro Mend. I will not be reordering."
