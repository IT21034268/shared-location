2,Not stable,This stand is too flimsy for my large laptop. It might work for a smaller one. A much better solution is the Allsop Metal Art Notebook Stand.Allsop Metal Art Notebook Stand
3,Targus PA243u Portable Lapdesk,"Unfortunately, one of the clips broke that enabled the lapdesk to raise up. Still using it...but was disappointed it broke so soon after purchase. But: hey! it didn't cost and arm and a leg and I'm still using it - so that's why I gave it a 3 instead of a 2."
2,Not impressed,"This is basically just a piece of plastic with slots in it that folds. Nothing more and nothing less.Sure there are grips on it to keep a computer from supposedly sliding off, but they do not work. I thought (by the picture) that they would have some sort of legs on it, but there is no legs at all on this.I was very disappointed. I merely use this for a tray to use my mouse and that is it."
1,painful!,"I was disappointed in this product. First comment, I also was expecting the long, gray tray (as some other people commented). It appeared that there would be a spot on the tray for a mouse. Not the case. The slats go all the way across. My second complaint is that it actually hurts to put it on my lap. The bottom lip digs into my legs. I ended up putting my laptop carrying case down and then the tray on top of it. Also, I am continually adjusting my laptop because it slides off the ""non-slip"" surface. Sorry to be so negative, but I was really excited to get this and then so disappointed with it."
3,It's functional.,"The board is good, but the nonslip surface is not nonslip. I have to continually reposition my laptop. I use it mostly in the angled position, and I would like for the computer to not slide as I use it."
2,"Flimsy, lightweight plastic","I liked the portability and the tilt stand feature but thethin, flimsy plastic cracked under the weight of my laptop when extended flat. Probably fine for small, lightweight laptops but steer clear if you have a heavyweight!"
3,I have used better,This Targus Lapdesk is made with very flimsy plastic that bows when you try to lift it up with the computer sitting on it. My previous Lapdesk was much sturdier.
3,Well designed but expensive piece of plastic,"I found this when searching for something to rest my laptop on during road trips. I couldn't find any ""bean bag"" lapdesks - kids already in school, all sold out at [local store], etc. This item works fine. Compact (but not so lightweight). Pretty pricey ... for just a piece of molded plastic with rubber skids. Works well on a desktop (or hotel room table) with folding configuration. Keeps your lap cool, protected from laptop heat. If I can find a comfortable bean-bag, kid's style lapdesk for [less money], I'll probably take this back but will sacrifice portability in the process. Targus lapdesk is best for hardcore travelers. ..."
2,Mega Review,The notebook portable lapdesk was Ok until we put the laptpo on it and lifted the portable lapdesk up with our laptop on it. The notebook portable lapdesk cracked down the center. Our laptop isn't that heavy and it should have been able to withhold the weight of the laptop but it didn't.Now we can only use our purchased product on a table with our laptop on it to give it circulation to keep our laptop cooler but we can't use it to place on our lap when sitting on the couch. We only used it a few times before it broke. Not satisfied with it's durability/strength. I would not advise purchasing one if your going to use it to rest on your lap and use your laptop.
4,simpleandeasy,This product works very well. It's very light so it's easily transported. From the desk to the table to the couch I'm very happy with this item.
3,Where's the Targus Advertised,"Targus seems to be a very well made laptop desktop, however I've counted four different models so far with the same model number. Had to return the one purchased through Amazon because what I received was not what was pictured. The last one I picked up at Walmart was all black, smaller vents and had a high gloss finsh. Very nice - it's a keeper!"
3,Adequate at a low price,"I got this item for $5.oo from a vendor that refurbished it. I was worth the price but I have seen it advertised for $25 from other stores. At $5 dollars, buy it!"
3,Needs improvement,"I just received the lapdesk last week. Primarily being used to cart laptop from room to room. The center tends to bow when 15.4"" laptop is being carted around. Otherwise, works okay for cooling and I have enough room to use a mouse."
3,works,"Works as advertised. one rubber foot came off and glued it back on. great for carpet, and putting your laptop at an angle on any flat surface."
3,"Light on cost, but also light on durability!","I am not sure what I expected for the small price of $25 but it was (and is) more than I got. Perhaps I was an uninformed shopper when I purchased two of these ""lapdesks"". If I had it to do over, I wouldn't (do it over, that is). I have a laptop with a 17"" screen that is pretty weighty and this lapdesk does not provide the rigidity I am looking for."
3,I know...,"At first I though if this should thing was useful. However, because I didn't try it anything like this before I decided to get one. I don't think this is something that everybody needs, however if you spend more than 4 hours with your laptop over your legs I thing this will help you. For the price this will reduce the heat on your legs around 40%, and that is a lot thinking that this is a piece of plastic with a couple of holes..."
3,"Good, but a little flimsy","The Targus Lapdesk offers more stability when I'm trying to use my laptop but I am always a little worried that the hinge is going to give way. I have not tried to pick it up by the edges, mostly because I don't want to risk my computer just to see how sturdy it really is. There is a lot of flex in the plastic but I am only using it to give a more stable surface for typing when I am away from my desk or a table. It seems to let more air underneath my laptop to keep it a little cooler."
5,Targus Lap Desk,Very portable. Fits perfectly in laptop case. Helps to keep laptop cooler than if it is sitting directly on your lap and prevents sliding with rubber pads. Room for use of minimouse on the side. Very convenient. Recommend to others.
1,Laptop Tray - Product redesigned and now too flimsy,"I bought this product because my brother had one and it was good quality. However Targus has redesigned the part without changing the part number. The new design part I received was very flimsy and would not support a standard laptop without significant bowing. The marketing photo at the time of purchase was the old, good design. The part shipped was the new, bad design. I returned the part."
5,It Does Exactly What I Needed,"I have a Gateway CX2610, and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes. Enter this Targus lapdesk. When folded out, it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours.But wait, there's more! I had also found my laptop awkward to use at a desk because of the poor ergonomics. However, I use this lapdesk folded with the adjustable leg to reposition the keyboard to a better angle for typing. It also puts the screen at a better height as well.The desk also works well folded in half with my laptop converted to tablet mode. So, it's a very versatile accessory to go with my versatile laptop. I highly recommend it."
2,A Little Bit Too Portable and Very Flimsy!!!,"I was expecting this product to be a lot more sturdy in my lap. It might work great for a traveling business person who has no other options but this product was not made for the home user with a wireless keyboard as it is not very comfortable on the lap and the surface is not big enough for a keyboard and a normal size mouse. Laptop mouse might work within the surface constraints. I do not see how anyone could use this product with the weight of a laptop. Overall, I was disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Wrong Photo,"In the thumbnail photos below the main photo on this listing (Targus PA243U), there is a photo of a lapdesk without massive grooves, but it has plenty of space for a mouse. This is not the item listed. I own the item listed and would LOVE to buy the one pictured in the thumbnail photos. If you know where I can get one, please advise.This rating is not indicative of the quality of the listed lapdesk, just given to get someone's attention. I like the listed one but it really lacks in mouse space. Literally the flat mouse space is one inch wide by about 5 inches high. Too small for me."
1,Hard on the skin,The delivered item does not look like the picture. The plastic is flimsy. The rubber pads keep the notebook from sliding.But the edge has a 1/4 inch raise lip on the bottom - making it uncomfortable after an hour with bare skin (Shorts/skirts)Xbrand XB-1004 Laptop Lap Desklooks better
2,Doesn't last long,"The Notebook Portable Lapdesk props up your laptop, so that you don't destroy your wrists while typing. I have used it every day for the past year and I am not unhappy with it. It does not cool the laptop like several other Targus products also reviewed here, but it certainly provides a better angle.However, I made the mistake of always placing my laptop in the same little plastic hook (there are 4 or 5 to choose from when you adjust the angle) every time I used it. This mistake and the fact that the lapdesk doesn't cool the laptop led to the little hook melting and the lapdesk collapsing. I am using the other little hooks now, but I don't like the angle quite so much.I don't know whether a year is the average life expectancy of these products, but I find it short."
4,Laptop desk,"I got this because my computer was overheating and it was affecting its performance. It's helped a lot with the overheating problem, but it sort of makes your keyboard sit at an uncomfortable angle. I sort of like that it's collapsable, which would be handy if you actually use your laptop everywhere, but since I don't, that feature's a bit annoying. Sometimes it will collapse will being used."
4,"My kid loves it, I can tolerate it","The rhymes are a bit forced, and some of the pop-ups are a little too fragilly constructed, but my kid loves it and still asks to read it, 1 1/2 months after Christmas."
1,useless,"This product is totally useless unless your skis are over 10yrs old. The rubber straps are about 2"" short for going over any shaped skis. I wrote to Thule about the problem and their response was a simple ""Thank You"""
3,A Book of 3 Sermons,"This book is a book about 3 sermons. Only one being about Isaiah 40:31. This would be helpful to someone needing a sermon. I wanted to study Isaiah 40:31 more indepth. The sermons are good, but doesn't get to the heart of Isaiah 40:31."
5,Brief But Honest Review,Brilliant!!!!!!! The best film I have seen about the mental and physical horrors experienced by the people within a concentration camp. I could not believe how brilliantly Vanessa Redgrave acted out her part along with many other women. Rarely does a movie touch one's heart so deeply as this movie. Definetly a movie for my collection.
5,WHY NO DVD ???,THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE THAT SHOULD NEVER BE LOST. PLEASE SOMEONE DIGITALLY REMASTER AND LET'S HAVE A DVD. THE SCRIPT AND THE PERFORMANCES ARE HAUNTING AND OFFER SO MUCH DEPTH TO A WORLD GONE MAD WITH THE PARADOX'S OF PERSECUTORS AND VICTIMS BECOMING CONFUSED AND DEADLY.
1,Won't fit standard microwave,"Website does not offer ANY information at all about the measurements of the produt, you'll think it will fit any stardard microwave oven, well it DOES NOT! I have a decent size over the range microwave, and when tried to use it; the tray won't turn inside the microwave because it's just too big. Please amazon/manufacter make sure you include measurements in your product description because otherwise item is totally useless."
5,The only way to cook bacon,"I've used this product for years. It's fast, convenient, and cooks the bacon to perfection. Grease drains away for a healthier result. What more could you ask for?"
5,microwave bacon tray,This is a replacement for one that we had for years. We use it all the time and works well.
2,"It works, but so does a plate","I microwaved bacon on ordinary dinner plates for years prior to getting this cooker. While this device works, it's not a lot better than my old method. It is better than an ordinary plate because it is square and therefore holds more bacon without it draping off the ends. It also is a little slanted so grease is collected in a trough. Here is why it's not great. Because it's square it does not turn in average sized microwaves which results in uneven cooking (I rearrange pieces half way through cooking). Also, There is still a lot of grease trapped within the ridges the bacon rests on and some of this grease dries out and becomes difficult to wash off (the ridges get in the way of cleaning. Also, this tray becomes very hot and requires oven mitts. I think the round style microwave bacon makers may be better, but I've never tried one."
4,good for the price,"I was looking for a basic microwavable bacon tray...I went with this for its large size and small price. Being dishwasher safe is great, but I do think the design could have used a little work...the slant should be steeper and the reservoir should be at the bottom of the slant! But even as is, I think this product probably works better than most."
3,bacon tray--good but not sized for carousels in most microwaves,"The concept of this is great, but the large rectangular shape can't move on the carousel in my microwave (it would take a VERY large microwave for this to turn).Everything else worked very well, and really loved its drip tray. However, the bacon just can't be cooked as easily as I was hoping because it's not shaped for the carousel.I have since found another one that is round, and it works better."
2,Satisfaction or No,"Product is okay but for a mircrwave where the dish is circular, this particular stype of microwave bacon tray is notthe best choice, but it will do."
4,Almost Perfect Bacon Rack,"I purchased four of these bacon racks, and I have only one complaint. These new racks are not as sturdy as the one I had for about fifteen years before it bit the dust. Be sure to clean very good each time it is used or the bacon will stick to the old residue. Cleaning does take some effort after making perfect bacon. This is truly a winner.Barbara in Mississippi"
2,Makes a BIG Mess,"The bacon tray works but if you have long bacon strips you have to cut it and it's hard to get the timing down, it's always different. The tray is a pain to clean, bacon sticks to it. Your better off using a paper plate and paper towel or a microwaveable plate."
5,Nordic ware rocks,This is the best of the microwave ware for cooking bacon. We have owned three of these and when one ended up in the trash (by mistake) it was great to be able to find the Bacon Tray on Amazon. It also works very well when I am defrosting a rolls or slice of corn bread.
2,Breaks Easily,"Product was cracked along the side when delivered, making it useless because the grease would spill over the side. Given the price, it was not worth going through the hassle to return the product since it was not delivered directly by Amazon.This was my second bacon tray, my first one lasted about 6 months before one of the bottom legs broke off when placing it in the sink. Although the quality is not the best, it does make very good bacon.I've since purchased a MiracleWare Meals in Minutes Microwave Bacon Grill and I'm extremely happy with the product."
1,The tray burned!,The plastic tray burned and turned black the first time I used it! I used it correctly. Would not recommend it. I threw it out.
1,Buyer Beware,"This item was shipped and received very quickly. No problems there. I used it one time with 8 slices of thin sliced bacon. I set the microwave on five and a half minutes,(less than the minute per slice as instructed), after approximately four minutes, there was smoke coming from the microwave and a section of this item had a burned place that almost went all the way thru the item. It took two days to get the smell out of the house. I have not contacted the seller, I figured there was probably no need to. I am just out the money. I wish I could post a picture to show just what it does look like. The microwave I was using is a new LG and I have not had any other problems with the microwave. I did not send it back because it is not worth the shipping charge and the hassle. This may be a one time fluke, that does happen, but if I could rate this a Zero, I would."
1,Unsatisfied,"Product came in, opened box and found that the product was broken. A corner of the product was missing and not in the shipping box. The box was in perfect shape. Would of liked to have a replacement but due to Amazon rules had to ship back for a refund. Will look elsewhere for product."
5,"Great Tray, Didn't Fit","I was so pleased to get the Nordic tray, but so sad that it did not fit into my microwave oven. It was exactly what I was looking for, but had to send it back. I would have kept it had it fit. I couldn't find the dimensions prior to ordering it."
3,Good Product,"I've used this bacon tray for many years however, I recently changed microwaves and the new microwave has a turning tray. Consequently, the bacon tray is too big and for the umpteenth time I have burned at least l piece of bacon and stained the tray. It's going out in the trash today. So, I'm on the web reading reviews for a new bacon microwave cooker."
2,Would not recommend,We bought this hoping to make our weekend breakfasts easier. Unfortunately this product just doesn't work very well. It is very hard to clean and doesn't cook the bacon evenly. Cooking bacon on a plate with paper towels will do the same thing or even on the boiler pan. I would not recommend this bacon tray for cooking bacon. Maybe I will try it as a defroster to see how it works for that?
4,Nice,This bacon cooker is just like our old one. It must be made of a different material as the bacon sticks quite a bit. I do like it better than any others on the market though.
2,Bacon!,"I grew up with one of these and it worked great in the microwave to cook up the delicious gift from God BACON! Much to my surprise it does not work in my microwave, the width from opposite corners exceeds the minimum width of the interior of the microwave. Since my microwave is just like almost every one on the market today it has a rotating tray inside. Normally each of the delectable slices of bacon get done equally on a plate but this gets stuck and an area of the bacon (probably where the microwaves are aimed) get done to a char while the rest is rubbery."
4,Make sure it is what you want,"An interesting video if you are a cat lover and enjoy cat shows. It follow several breeders and see how they prepare for one of the biggest show, also a comprehensive coverage of the show. And although I am thousands of miles away in Hong Kong, I see familiar face of the judges! But it is a documentary, not a ""how-to"" video that teach you how to groom your cat and prepare for the show nor tell you what is ""The standard of Perfection"". Make sure it is what you want."
2,decent but not fabulous.,"I'm a Mark Lewis fan, which is why I ordered this movie in the first place. There are definitely highlights and the movie is entertaining but did not live up to expectations set by The Natural History of the Chicken."
4,Inspector Rudd dismisses the obvious once again.,"Martin Holt has visited his father Rex and things have not gone well, he leaves with an atmosphere of antagonism between father and son. However, Rex relents and send his son a handsome cheque. That same night Rex is murdered, and Martin is the chiefsuspect especially by the village grapevine. Inspector Rudd agrees that it looks likely, opportunity and motive are obvious -perhaps too obvious.Nonetheless, he keeps an open mind - much to his assistant's disgust: Sgt Boyce has made up his mind. Their relationship is not as warm as that of some other detective teams, and the sgtcan be very stubborn; at the same time, Rudd is brooding over hisown obsession with a female police surgeon. A light mystery,no blood and gore, easy to read in 2 days, I enjoy June Thomson'sbooks - which are not widely known in the States. ""The LongRevenge"" was particularly good, I thought."
4,Good yet divergent pieces,"Being an ardent fan of Chavez' music I must first say that this is a great CD. I have no particular complaints regarding either the works or the performances. My only concern, and thus the reason for four stars instead of five, is the lack of commonality between the selections in the program. I have yet to understand why the ethereal ""Suite for Double Quartet""(the best of the CD by the way) was included with the highly percussive and, aside from ""Xochiplli"", somewhat serialistic works that compose the remainder of the program. While all the works have their merits, the lack of any logic in their inclusion on this disc is somewhat annoying. Yet for true Chavez fans this a must have all the same."
4,A good program,"I would disagree that the program is too varied. This is a bit like an hour-long radio program devoted to the chamber music of Chavez; you wouldn't want it to all be the same. I atually like having the Suite juxtaposed in this way against the other works that are admittedly different in character. The opening work is indeed an ""imagined"" music and a comparison with anything might seem jarring. The percussion is well recorded, though much of it is delicate rather than powerful. I had thought that Eduardo Mata was a student of Chavez at one time, but can't find any evidence of that after a brief Web search. But this was one of Mata's valedictory albums, and it does make one miss him. Recommended for fans of Latin-American music, or devotees of percussion that can tolerate the other instrumental combinations here."
5,This book is brilliant,"I love it when a book starts with ""This doesn't tell you XXX because if you haven't learned that from your first C book, this will be out of your league""Well, not exactly, but close.It's really good as a reference, and truly well-written.Gary (-;PS It's not Stevens's book, but I'd recommend it anyway."
4,"very sharp, poor quality sheath","the knife came very sharp, and in perfect condition, its says 'handcrafted in china' on the bottom of the blade. the knife seems to be of very good quality, but the sheath is not. its like a woven polyester or whatever. it is not so much the sheath, but the strap and button holding it on, it is kind of flimsy. can't go wrong with a quality knife, wooden handle knife that keeps its edge, for a price like that."
2,2 stars,"As this was an interesting collection of footage on the origins of the monster truck era. I was drawn to make the purchased based on it's explanation that this would be a must see for adults and children of all ages and experiences. This show was lengthy, repetitive and lost not only my interest but that of our sons as well. It proceeds like a mechanical interpretation of the monster truck itself and not the phenomena behind it. I do not recommend this for adults or children."
1,Disappointed,I ordered some dinner plates to add to my Franciscan Desert Rose originally purchased in the 1970's not realizing that Franciscan has compromised their quality. Unfortunately this seems to be the case with most dinnerware as years go by. The plates no longer have the beautiful hand painted detail and delicacy that once made these plates beautiful. There is no comparison in quality. The older dishes were hand painted with shading and uniqueness and made in England. These plates are made in China and have lost their beauty. It looks like the pattern was stamped on. I ended up finding older quality vintage plates on eBay.
2,"Perfectly burns, every time!","This delightful appliance has one heating element along the middle at the bottom, and one on top, leaving anything you toast black & singed on whatever part is directly above the element. Nice feature if you like uneven, partially burned toast.Can't fit 4 Eggo waffles in there, either. I want my old toaster back."
4,mine's fine ....,i like this little toaster oven ... and my toast doesn't burn ... the toast feature is essentially good enough ... browns one side a bit more than the other so i have to turn over the toast for even browning ...but i like the 'stay on' and temperature features ... i use it for baking and that's been quite successful ....
5,A good overview of the year in science fiction,"As always, Gardner Dozois came through with a great overview of the year in science fiction. This year doesn't have any spectacular stand-out stories, but still, there is a lot of good reading here."
2,Was it a bad year?,"I'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing. I kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that I lose interest in these stories half way thru. They all seem too long, unfocussed. What they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories. The quality puzzles me because I'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf I read in the zines. I haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing."
4,Fun & Cooking,"Not only do you get (sometimes old fashioned, and that is great!) nice recipes by (famous) authors, you get to make them too! Cooking oOut Of This World is a classic and it's a good thing it is available in this nice and affordable paperback. For all those fond of science fiction authors and cooking, a must!"
3,"Library binding, not really!","I love Bill Waterson, and in the immediate i saw an option for library binding I have to own it. Most of the Comics books i have, are ""glue binding"". pages drop out after extensive reading over years.. so when I saw an option for library binding, i thought it would be a thread binding.for additional ~10 dollar all was difference was hard cover smoothly wrapped from front cover of the standard book. it is still bind with glue. though the pages are no longer paperback, in its place are shinny ones of better quality. its a good thing this book wasnt thick.. if it was the spine would break right in the middle. and the pages would drop."
5,excellent,truly and surely one of the best ways to spend a Sunday afternoon if you are bored. READ THIS! it has some of the best and most inventive comedy ever!
4,"""Shine Sweet Freedom""","As a whole the soundtrack wasn't that great. I actually bought it to get that one song by Michael McDonald. It was worth buying it to get that one song. ""Shine Sweet Freedom"" is just one of those 80's songs that makes you feel good."
1,AWFUL GARBAGE!!!,"The guy just rambles on about his own band and what he tought of nirvana he is a real creepy guy. Plus it's so low budget and it's retarded it doesn't even say what songs he's playing. He just lables every thing by riffs. Plus he goes through everything sooooo fast he doesn't even say what frets he on or anything. The dvd just seems like ""hey look at me I can play nirvana"" It's one of the worst dvds of all time."
3,"Short stories, too short, good writing","I thought this was a novel when I started reading it, and was disappointed when the first story did not develop into a novel... and the second one, and the third... in other words, most of the stories felt too short, too unresolved, too much like chapters from a novel. Only the last one, ""The Goings-On of the World,"" was long enough to feel complete.I loved the story about a woman who marries a tattoo artist and gets herself covered in tattoos by him; it has mind-joggling images and metaphors about the meaning of tattoos in life, and I really wanted it to continue and develop, but it just... stopped.Then there was the title story, an interesting one about an old woman who travels around getting free temporary housing by pretending she is a distant relative, until her story is blown and she has to move on; it too, just... stopped.Ms. Mccracken is a good writer; the lack is in the form, not in the writing."
4,Excellent introduction to ferns,"This is a highly readable introduction to ferns by Robbin Moran, a botanist at the NY Botanical Gardens. The book is at once literate, anecdotal, and scientific. You can read it for information, for instruction, and for entertainment.How many books on botany cite both Shakespeare and a Walter Matthau movie in furthering the story of ferns? Moran spends a good part of a chapter discussing the movie, A New Leaf, which deals with Elaine May, as a botanist, discovering a new species of fern and naming it after her true love, Matthau. Indeed, Moran's enthusiasm for the movie shows no bounds--he presented it one evening at a summer workshop in Maine that I attended.But don't get me wrong--the book is serious science with a sense of humor, sort of like a more focused version of a Stephen Jay Gould book."
5,Globalizing gender Studies,"Finally a comprehensive textbook, of real pedagogical value for professors, ready to incorporate Women and Politics in Latin America in their syllabi. The survey and analysis of machismo is exhilarating.great job!"
3,"""The Jefferson Scandals"" Revisited","Note to a previous reviewer: Virginius Dabney was a man. He was a longtime Virginia newspaper editor and died shortly after ""The Jefferson Scandals"" was published. He was unquestionably a sincere gentleman and passionate in his defense of Jefferson's honor and purity. He didn't live to see the definitive DNA evidence that confirms the Sally Hemings relationship. The consistent denials of the affair by Jefferson apologists, in my opinion, involve more than a tinge of racism. These same scholars have no problem affirming Jefferson's liaison with Maria Cosway, who was probably much less virtuous than Sally Hemings. It is entertaining, however, to read Dabney's book with Fawn Brodie's back-to-back. We eagerly await an up-to-date Jefferson biography that fully explores the new evidence."
4,GOod adapter,"It works, I just wish the adapters fit my power port a little better, it sticks out a lot and will be easy to knock out."
2,Not a stand alone book.,"Jerry Jenkins writing style is fast paced. I finished this book in a day. I didn't particularly care for it though. If there had been some sort of resolution to this book, I might have given it another star or two. It really irks me that I picked up this book and it ended between chapters. There is no resolution at all. I can understand some sort of cliff hanger, but this is ridiculous. It felt like the author chopped off the back part of the book.I have no interest in starting another series. If I realized this was a series I wouldn't have picked it up. I thought the premise was pretty good, but when I got into the story it felt too similar to Left Behind. Been there, done that, not gonna read it again."
4,Compelling Story,"An easy read, for sure, but this story depicts what the future world would be like if all religion was banned. It blames all the wars in the world on religious beliefs and theorizes that wars will end when religion is banned. A compelling story that, I am affraid, is a little too realistic. Jenkins does a great job with character development from atheists to believers in Christ. I can't wait for the sequal...."
1,"Yeah, right.","I tried to read this crap, I really did. Unfortunately Jenkins fighteningly simplistic understanding of war, as well as poor writing, just turned me off.No Religion = No War? Since when? Wars are fought for land or water or gold or oil or cattle. Anything that one person or group has and another person or group wants will spark a war.Throwing religion in as a motivation is nice icing on the cake, but it's not what the fighting's all about."
4,Seems okay,"It seems like a good story. Jerry Jenkins seriously needs to stop writing though, he's going overkill on the whole ""Left Behind"" theme."
2,"I though ""Soon"" was poorly written.","This was my first Jerry Jenkins book. Not enough diversity in the characters, everyone sounded the same. A somewhat interesting plot, but too religious for my taste. I might recommend it to some of my religious fanatic friends. :)"
4,Compelling Fiction,"This is a more than acceptable follow up to the Left Behind series, taking the reader in a different and fascinating direction. In this compelling story, Jenkins answers the question, ""What if all religion was outlawed completely? Would the world be better off for it?"" The answer is, of course, a resounding ""no."" Protagonist Paul Stepola's life mirrors that of Paul the Apostle (""Stepola"" is a scrambling of the word apostle) in a series of compelling circumstances that includes the literal stoning of a man named Stephen and a bout of temporary blindness. The book is a thrill ride from beginning to end, with the reader always wondering when the other shoe will drop and Paul's double agent status will be discovered. The only criticism I had was that Stepola's conversion experience seemed a little flat when compared to the Biblical Paul's, though it could be argued that it's more typical of what happens to most people who come to Christ. All in all, a worthwhile, interesting read."
2,Should have questioned when i saw two D batteries required.,"Being a hunter i was drawn to the woodwork with the stag but that's where the craftsmanship ends. The cookoo bird is plastic and has a slow echo sound. The clock hands are a white plastic with a plastic face plate and the music doesn't sound good. Last but not least, the weights and chains are not functional and are for looks only... ( hense the need for the batteries ). The only other good thing about it is it keeps good time......"
3,Bought as gift for parents....ok but not great,The price was right and I decided to take the cuckoo clock route for Xmas gifts. The clock itself was detailed and quality. The think I was dissapointed by was the cheap plastic piece that goes back and forth for the bottom. If the rest is wood why would they make this plastic. My parents seemed to like but will see if it survives the test of time
4,Vivid Large Deer Cuckoo clock,"I have got what I expected.. All the items listed are in the package, though I have not installed it yet so dont know about its working condition but it seems everything is perfect so would not cause any problem there too..it is perfect for the place as I was expecting...I am really happy to buy this product..."
1,Makes concepts more complex than needed,"Book has good analogies and humor but it seems to make concepts which are quite easy in other books quite complex in this one. I used this book in a undergraduate stats class and found myself reading and rereading pages to try to extract usable information which would fall within the class study guide. The reason the instructor developed the study guide was because the book was too much fluff and explanation. If you are majoring in studies that are heavily math oriented then you may like this, but if your are majoring in Psychology, Education or Social Sciences there are books(with SPSS) which are much much clearer and quite easy. After taking several research courses I still found I did not need half of the information in this book.KISS principle(Keep It Simple Stupid)"
5,Stats Modeling the World,"Brand new book in great condition-- used in AP high school stats and Cornell University Math 1710 stats. However, this book didn't come with a CD."
5,AP edition is teacher edition with even and odd answers,AP edition is teacher edition with even and odd answersExactly the same text!! so buy the cheapest one !
2,Not impressed,Used this product for about 2 months. Didn't seem to reduce any hair at all. In fact all it did was attract ants to my dogs food dish. I have a lab if that makes any difference.
1,Not,"It had no effect on a yellow lab. I also used 32 oz. before I used this gallon. It probably is healthy, but I saw now reduction in hair lose. My lab is now 3, he was 1.5 when I started the treatment. I give a fish oil pill everyday and feed him Blue Buffalo large breed. Everyone says he has the softest hair they have ever felt. I brush 3-4 times a day and just with a simple shake with the sun right, you can see the hair go everywhere. Obviously, he has very healthy hair. He keeps replacing it. I think the dogs genetics tell them what to do, no matter what we try to change."
1,Disappointed,"Shed-Solution for Dogs, 1 GallonWhat I thought I had ordered and what I got were two different things. I had been ordering and receiving the Shed-Stop which is a great product. This time when I ordered what I received was Shed-Solution. I am disappointed in it. When I went on-line to look at the item the bottles are labeled exactly the alike. When the product came the picture on the front was brown so I assumed that they just changed the look but the product inside is very different. Once I realized that it was a different product I figured since this bottle said that it controlled shedding it would work the same boy was I wrong and my dogs made up for lost time in shedding. Apparently it does not taste the same either because my dogs do not furiously attack it like they did the Shed-Stop. In fact they look at me every feeding as if they are disappointed in the flavor."
4,Seems to work. Dogs love it.,"I purchased Shed Stop a while ago and it seems to be working. We have a lab/shepherd mix and he was shedding terribly. After using the Shed Stop, the shedding is much less. It's now spring and we're noticing that his normally shedding process is taking place, so brushing more will help. I've also been giving the product to our chocolate lab. Her shedding wasn't quite as bad. In addition to less shedding, they both have a beautiful coat. It is a bit spendy, so I've been ordering it by the gallon, which helps defray the cost a little bit."
5,Pumpkin cheesecake!,The cookies in here are fricking great and people will think you're a rock star if you make the pumpkin cheesecake.
2,"poorly done, inaccurate","The movie is a re-enactment that was poorly done and poorly casted. The people who played the various family members were not even close in appearance. I actually thought this was more of a documentry with actual footage, instead, it was cheesey actors with Linda Kasabian going on and on about how remorseful she is.... actually myself and the people who watched it with me didnt buy it. I think she said what would look good, and collect a paycheck. A waste of money in my view. I am not a kid, I was 22 myself with the manson murders happend. I ve read most of the books and seen most of the movies... this one is forgetable."
1,No DVD included,"I order the movie Manson 40 years Later and the DVD case was cracked and partly opened, when I opened it the DVD was not there. What kinda of nonsense is that??"
1,Manson's no mastermind.,"If Charles Manson is/was the mastermind behind the savage murders, then I'm Mother Teresa! The killers made the decision to kill all on their own and for Kasabian to sit there talking like she's so lilly white innocent is totally wrong. Furthermore, I don't believe Charlie made anyone do anything. We all have choices in life and it's up to us all to make the right ones. Nobody can twist our arms and make us do anything except what we want to do. There's a book out titled: ""Crucified: The Railroading Of Charles Manson"" by Michael White. I would suggest people reading that book unstead of taking anything this film says for the gospel. I wouldn't be writing this now if I honestly thought Charles Manson was an evil cult leader or mastermind as this film portrays."
4,"Very helpful, small quibble on pronunciation","I find the CDs very helpful, especially when driving. The pauses between words are just long enough to give me time to think of the meaning, but no so long that I feel like I am waiting for the next one.I am hardly the person to criticize his pronunciation, but I have a lot of trouble distinguishing a from o the way he pronounces them. They both sound like ""a"" in father most of the time. It would be easier to distinguish of ""o"" was closer to ""off"" (like aww instead of ahh) Because of this, I have trouble visualizing the spelling while I am driving."
2,Ho Hum...,"I had high hopes for this picture being that it was made in Britain, but after I started falling asleep during the fight scenes I knew something was missing. It just doesn't make sense to see all these modern attitudes in a movie that takes place when attitudes were very different. Women were not overtly brash and bratty as depicted by a rather hum-drum Uma Thurman. Bergin acts more like a spoiled teenager making stupid insults that are bound to get him in trouble (who wrote this thing...6th graders?). On the positive side, the costumes were nice and the horses looked good. But for me, I'll pull out my old video of Errol Flynn's ""Adventures of Robin Hood""; corny and dated, but it sure is good entertainment."
2,It isn't easy ...,"...to redo a well-worn tale like Robin Hood. To make it gritty, witty and humorous is an art. This film is sometimes gritty, rarely humorous and never witty. It tries too hard and yet the actors appear without clear direction which element of style they are pursuing in any given scene, and when they do have a clear direction the results are inelegant and even camp. The only caveat I can offer is that I made it only through 40 minutes of this film."
5,A true classic!!,"I recently saw this movie and I have to say that it is a great movie because it has action, a little bit of humor and everything else a movie needs in order to be perfect. This movie is just great and there are no other words of describing it. A masterpiece!"
4,better than Kevin's version,"First let me say tht I'm a Kevin Costner fan. I prefer Wyatt Earp to Tomestone and have actually watched Waterworld from beginning to end (perhaps the only person ever to have done this!). Nonetheless, this gritty version of the RH story is second only to Robin and Marian (think, Sean Connery as Robin Hood!) as the best. Uma Thurman was (more or less) unknown when this was made (well, I didn't know her anyway...) and Patrick Bergen remains unknown (again, this is only so far as I know...). But together they make a degree of music not seen with my bud, Kevin's version of the tale.Early on in this film, there is a confrontation between Robin and a team of the sherrif's men. It sets the stage in a way that Kevin's confrontation in the Middle East just doesn't make. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth your dollar - if you want to enjoy a darker Robin Hood (and Uma Thurman)."
5,Disney,Purchased for our granddaughter who will love it. She is collecting VHS Disney films and this was on her list.
4,A version that will keep viewers riveted!,"This verison (which was first made as a theatrical film for European cinema, then shown on FOX TV, and then shortened for video by about forty minutes) stars Patrick Bergin as the outlawed Earl of Huntington (portrayed with some touches of humor and plenty of physical action and presence); Uma Thurman as a very independent Lady Marian; Jeroen Krabbe as the Norman lord who was once Robin's friend but must now hunt him down; and Jurgen Prochnow as an extremely pouty and self-important Guy of Guisbourne. This version does not attempt to clean up the legend of Robin Hood (as in some previous versions), but instead reveals it in all its down-and-dirtiness, especially when showing all the opression that Robin is fighting against. If it could be released in its full length, this would be a must for any collection, but even in its shortened state it's well worth seeing. END"
2,Bland,Ok movie. Uma Thurman was good. Movie was too silly for my taste. Some of the scenes strain credibility. Seems like the director wasn't sure if it should be funny or serious. The blend failed.What is it with Robin Hood movies? A great story yet in the last 30 years all of the Robin Hood movies have been mediocre to poor.
2,By no means the best,"To me, this was an inferior version of Robin Hood, simply because I couldn't get a handle on the central character and still don't know whether or not I was supposed to take him seriously. Poor casting for the lead (and, for all I know, equivocal directing). Much of the film was good, but this spoiled it for me. (By contrast, Uma Thurman was wonderful as Marion, although it was a pity we didn't get to hear her speak more.)"
5,down and dirty med,Went above and beyond my expectation was a very good down and dirty was of doing an assessment and treatment
1,save your money,"I love the Beautiful South--enough to have bought almost all of their CD singles over the years--but this one just isn't worth it, unless you're desperate to see the attached ""Perfect 10"" video. A mediocre rhyming rant against the Euro (""the root of all evil"") set against a plodding rhythm track. This one should have stayed in the studio. Here's hoping the next effort will be a return to form."
1,"Horrible, Disappointing ending ruins the book","This book had a very good plot. The details concerning the history of the native people and the region could have been less; it kind of took away from the direction and the pace of the story. The book was good until the ending, which completely made me feel as though I wasted my time reading the beginning and the middle. It was as though the author's deadline was upon her and she wrapped up the ending all neat and packaged. Absolutely ruins the book."
1,A real mess . . .,"Ms. Stokes first book, The Tree People, showed real promise ... and several problems common to a first novel. I looked forward to her evocative description of the Pacific Northwest and the Quinault culture along with an improved novel structure.To say I was disappointed is a gross understatement! Absurd plot elements (spontaneous human combustion, serial sex abuse, murder and patricide, Siberian tiger catnapping, even a bizarre battle between Orcas and the tiger) overwhelm what could have been an engaging story of Jordan Tidewater's shamanistic ""coming of age"" and her growing relationship with the mysterious and disturbing Lima Clemente.Ms. Stokes -- what on earth were you trying to do here???"
2,Somewhat creepy - rambling and disjointed,"Somewhere between mystery, shamanism and science fiction, this book has a strange plot of overlapping mysteries, a completely obvious pair of murders, and a rather gratuitous amount of gore. Oh - and it finishes off with a fight between a killer whale and a Siberian tiger. (? ) The heroine, Tribal Sheriff Jordan Tidewater, is strong, interesting and likeable, the imagery is beautiful, and the supporting characters are the strong point. Unfortunately, the plot never really comes together in any meaningful way."
4,Don't buy this for the Four Seasons!,"As much as I like Menhuin's playing, these recordings of the Four Seasons are pretty routine. Repeated listening is not rewarding. I wish Jaap Schroeder's would come back (available eons ago), but in any case, there are many fine renditions available, both in traditional (many) and in more provocative styles (Kennedy). In the same vein, the other Vivaldi string pieces by these same forces on this disc are a little dry and not as attractive as they could be.The rest of the disc, however, is pure and absolute joy. Music making of the highest order in very good sound. I have enjoyed this disc more than I thought!"
4,"works fine, so far.","i have only used the charger and ac-powered speakerphone features of this product. i intend to use the phone to synchronize information between my laptop computer and my cellular phone, sony-ericsson t68i."
3,Doesn't sound like a cello,"The cello source sound seems to be altered in some way. I think some re-tuning program has been used that takes out some of the 'micro-pitch fluctuations' and even some of the harmonics of a naturally played cello. The fundamental pitch of each drone is thus very accurate in terms of cents, as I have checked them with a Petersen strobo-tuner, but the end result sounds more like some muddy sine waves than a rich sonourous cello. Better of getting an electronic shruti-box if you are wanting drones to play along with imho. Pity it doesn't sound much like a cello as I expected."
5,SHOW CATTLE,Show Cattle is very entertaining and informative at the same time. Full of humor for all ages. The production of this film is excellent and you willwant to rerun it time after time.
3,A decent read ... IN THE NIGHTSIDE!,"Decent. The supernatural noir thing is pretty enjoyable, and the Nightside setting is entertaining. The plot is fairly meager, but for an introductory volume that's not terrible; this first book's priority *should* be to introduce us to all the nifty characters and places, and the only place the paper-thin plot really falls down is at the end, when the climax amounts to something very much like ""And then he hit it really hard."" The writing is by no means impressive, but it's serviceable, and aside from the ridiculous ""... in the Nightside!"" tic that the author peppers throughout, it rarely grates. It's not great literature, but it's quick and fun; even odds as to whether I'll read future volumes, but was certainly a decent read to pass the time."
2,Okay First Book,"John Taylor, a private eye /w a gift for finding things, is hired by a rich businesswoman to find her runaway daughter, who's somewhere in the Nightside - London's seedy supernatural doppelganger.I can't say this book was good, but if you can get past the over-done detective noir voice and John's constant monologuing, he's a fairly likable lead character. The book started out slow (probably b/c it took me a while to get used to the narration), but the pace picked up about 1/4 through and flowed nicely after that. The ending wasn't very satisfying - lots of build-up to the big confrontation that ends more with a wimper than a bang.But, since I liked John & the world the author created has promise, I'll give the second book a try. Overall, I'd say this is a quick read for when you're in-between books. I'd defintely read the teaser paragraph b/f buying though, to make sure the narration isn't too distracting."
3,Easy reading fantasy,"Simon Green gives us Private Detective John Taylor and an unseen aspect of London, the Nightside that can only be accessed by the few. Taylor has certain powers and reputation but keeps out of the Nightside until he is asked to help rescue a missing daughter and goes back for the first time in five years.This is very light, short and easy to read fantasy, nothing deep, complex or special about this one but a harmless way to lose a couple of hours as the author treads a path already well worn by (perhaps) better authors. A few minor errors that Londoners will recognise (British Rail uniforms in the Underground?) and a fairly light story that does a lot of scene and character setting will certainly not tax the reader but may provide a glimpse of better things to come."
3,It's okay,"Listning to this on MP3, and am about halfway through. Don't like to stop reading a book once I start, but am having trouble with this one. The plot is ok, but it's like the author wrote the book by submitting the plot to a detective novel cliche generator. Maybe that was his method of giving it a detective noir quality; I wasn't expecting great literature when I selected this book, but I think I can find better than this, and probably won't read another by this author."
4,Quick read but a good one,"A short book but a good one. This book sits at two hundred and thirty three pages but not a one is wasted. It is about a ""PI"" who has a gift finding things. The catch is that he is from a place that exists parallel to ours and Magic, Gods, Devils, Monsters and other assorted things exist there. This world is similar to Neil Gaiman's parallel universe and even has many similarities to Simon Green's other famous city of ""Haven"" set in his Hawk and Fisher novels.I read this book in about two hours and I enjoyed it. It's not often I get a chance to read a really short book that's good and it is refreshing sometimes to have a book jump right to the point and not have pages upon pages of descriptive writing, not that that's bad or anything, it's just not necessary every time."
1,I wish I read the (negative) reviews first,"I don't normally write reviews, but this one needs a warning label. Since I bought Glen Cook's and Jim Butcher's series, Amazon thought I would like this. Seems fair enough -I'm always up for a Pulp detective fantasy set in a darkly fantastic London.I didn't expect something this awful. Wow. Thin plot ""episodes"" loosely strung out. Character de-development. Partially digested ""world-building"". The sheer volume of clumsy exposition. What editor gave this the green light?When I finished the book, I couldn't help seeing some potential. With a bit of extra work, this novel may have been funny in that way a lurid sci-fi novel from 30-40 years ago is, sort of. I guess the best thing it left me with was a feeling that if Mr. Green could sell this, I should start penning my own half-baked ideas. Maybe this was a sign from above! A sign that either I am destined for greatness or maybe that I should read reviews first.I suspect the latter."
3,"Well, it was just OK","This was a very VERY bumpy start to a series. You have to force yourself to finish it to be honest. He's EXTREMELY vague about things in the 'Nightside' to the point that it starts to get pretty old. Another review said that it's like he thinks the world he's created is just the best thing ever, and I have to agree. He relies on the world we know nothing about to impress us simply because it's the Nightside. The Characters are very forgettable too, and they go from one extreme to another, and they are powerful for no reason other than because he says so. I'll read the next book, because it has the embers that could become a raging fire.P.S.This can't hold a candle to Jim Butchers Dresden Files, and I honestly doubt it ever will. This is the reason I picked it up. It was not funny, he explained little to nothing, and it's trying way WAY too hard to be like the Dresden Files, almost to the point of absurdity."
3,Seems like only one-fourth of a book,"This book is just okay. I LOVE the nightside world, and that's why I'm giving it three stars, but this book fell really short of my expectations (it's the first of the nightside novels that I've read). I also enjoyed the plot. But I didn't feel the character would have the emotional connection to the other main character that was implied, and that the entire ending really hinged upon. I just don't buy it. If the novel had been longer and the connection greater, maybe it might have worked. As it is, I'm reluctant to buy any more nightside novels. I prefer a deeper emotional connection between my characters before they're devastated if love doesn't work out.Imtimacy rating: little bit of sexual dialogue, non-graphic."
1,Second Rate...,"I decided to take a look at this series since it seemed to fall along the lines of Jim Butcher's, The Dresden Files, what a rip off. This thing is nothing but a second rate, excuse me third or forth rate attempt at riding on Butcher's characters.Green has done nothing but change the names and setting. Taylor for Dresden, Susie Shooter for Murphy, Razor Eddie for Thomas and list goes on and on. I hate I ever wasted my money, it won't happen again.If you are a true lover of Butcher's work, then take my advice and don't read this garbage...."
1,"Throwing the book against the wall, in the Nightside","If it weren't for the overuse of the phrase ""in the Nightside"", this book would be an average little thriller. Unfortunately, the repetitive use of ""<fill in the blank>, in the Nightside"" had me ready to run screaming from the room before I was halfway through the book. Some paraphrased examples: ""Things are not always as they seem, in the Nightside"". ""Dreams/nightmares often come true, in the Nightside"". I can only put up with a certain amount of cheese and cliche, and this book exceeded its quota."
5,I have fallen in love with a new series!,"This is a wonderful new series. If you like the Anita Blake Series, Tanya Huff and Jim Butcher series, you will love this new series by Simon Green.This is the first book in the series. John Taylor is a private eye in London. He is not originally from London though. He grew up in The Nightside, which is a secret world where nighttime never ends, and where every fantasy character you can imagine you will find from sleezy clubs, to demons, to the most interesting cast of characters I have read about in a while. John Taylor left the Nightside five years ago with no intention of ever returning. Then along comes a missing persons case that he cannot say no to. John has a special gift. He finds things. He can pretty much find anything that you are looking for. Well his new client's daughter is missing and the last place she was seen was the Nightside.I do not want to spoil the story, but this is a world you will LOVE. I highly highly recommend."
3,hohum in the nightside,"if 'something from the nightside' were a sandwich it would be a grilled cheese (kraft american on wonder bread), not much substance or flavor but still food. green's characters waffle, strong one minute/feared by most to wimpering and crying balls of emotional goo. the storyline wasnt horrible, but it wasnt great either. add to this 'the nightside' being repeated to death and you have a very average read. i hear the series improves and hope this is true, but if you want a more solid series try glen cook's Garrett Files."
3,Editor Needed,"While I enjoyed the concept and found the main character interesting, I was distracted by the poor writing style. If I didn't know better I would think this was the author's first book. Green repeats himself over and over again. The phrase ""in the Nightside"" is used frequently - up to five times on one page! This type of repetition is not necessary, it slows down the narrative and distracts from the overall story."
4,Macabre Detective/Fantasy,"On the recommendation from my local bookstore, I picked up this debut novel by Simon R. Green because I was fascinated by the description of a story that takes place within hidden, perpetually dark world located far below the streets of London, the Nightside. In the Nightside world it's always 3am and this fascinating world is inhabited by humans and other powerful and scary beings.The main character is investigator John Taylor, a man who is psychically gifted with the unique ability to find anything...in the Nightside realm. Taylor had escaped from the Nightside into the real world five years ago and promised himself he'd never go back. Taylor reneges on this promise when a woman comes to hire him for his services, her daughter is missing and she is willing to pay the investigator good money to get her daughter back.The book is entertaining work of fantasy, mystery and paranormal, there's a lot of solid groundwork here for an excellent series."
1,Terrible attempt to ride Jim Butcher's coattails,"Green is clearly influenced by the success of Jim Butcher's excellent Harry Dresden books and this book is the first in his own series featuring the Nightside. The universe is moderately interesting but Green's brutally overwrought writing style ruins any possibility of enjoyment. John Taylor is a demonic B-movie gumshoe who speaks in cliches and ""lives"" in a world of stale ideas - viz. his girlfriend/bounty-hunter Shotgun Suzie- a killer with a heart of gold and a serious mad-on for our boy. Bleah.Jim Butcher's series is marked not only by a relatively inventive take on urban D&D; but by sympathetic characters who are well-written and interesting.Don't get sucked in by this book- instead, go to George R.R. Martin, Joe Hill or Peter Straub."
5,Fantastic! Haven't enjoyed a book this much in a LONG time.,"I absolutely loved this book. Read it in two sittings.Fast-paced, full of colorful, extremely likeable characters that I found myself genuinely caring about.The writer keeps coming up with new ideas and creative supernatural concepts - the book is full of hints for things that will develop later on. Indeed, there's a great sense of continuity and an ongoing storyline which renders me incapable of waiting to get my hands on the next in the series (I wanted to go buy it now, but Barnes & Noble closed early for Christmas...)Anyway, the book contains many mysteries that will be developped in the future, and it reminded me of the Buffy and Angel tv shows. I don't wanna give anything away, so I'll just say there is a LOT to look forward to.The book is also full of humor, and the main character, John Taylor, always has a funny or tongue-in-cheek retort ready.To conclude, an absolute crowd pleaser. I couldn't have asked for more."
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"In this novel, Mr. Green creates a world parallel to the beloved city London, but entirely different in itself. ""The Nightside"" is a darker version of London where pretty much anything goes, and it is always 3 AM. The weather is created by the feeling of the city itself, and a person can slip into the past or future simply by walking in the wrong place. Everything flows in this novel from the fast paced plot to the truly original characters. Finally I encountered a twist that I actually did not see coming. I would defiantly recommend this book to any fellow fantasy heads. The only thing I noticed that irked me was frequent grammatical errors, but they do not disrupt the reading. I will defiantly continue with this series."
5,Quirky and fresh,This was a nice change of pace from the standard fiction being presented these days. It is an odd quirky story that let's your imagination run wild.
2,I,"This was a genre with a story stuck on, like a veneer. It lacked depth. There were hints that the main character was something more than he realized, and that was interesting, and the idea of the Darkside itself, a dark and dangerous aspect of London inhabited by dark and dangerous people, was also interesting, but it's more or less been done before, and better, by the likes of Neil Gaiman and China Melville."
4,Phillip Marlowe Meets Harry Potter and Jack Skellington,"Green takes his readers on a bumpy, jarring, stomache-sqeezing ride through a land with a hero who is part Harry Potter, part Jack Skellington, and part Phillip Marlowe. Don't blink. You don't want to miss one moment of the surreal, labyrinthine, nightmare tour of Nightside. Although the story is set in a world of corruption and danger, it's not all noire alleys and menacing shadows. In ""Chandlerish"" staccato style, Green knows how to include surprising little oases of beauty and light. Action. Suspense. Romance. Fantasy. Humor. It's all here in one tightly-crafted story. A brilliant read for fans of fantasy and old fashioned detective stories."
2,way way too short,"the story was decent enough, but it barely qualifies as a novella... $5.20 (kindle version) is way too much for a ""book"" i knock out in little more than two hours. if you want to read this, skip the kindle version, and get it in print used somewhere for $2 or so..."
5,Excellent mix!!!,"My hats off to Simon R. Green. He is quite the story teller. Being a fan of sci fi, horror, and fantasy, this series is right up my alley. He is a genius when it comes to blending all three elements together, calling up elements H. P. Lovecraft, Ambrose Beirce, Roger Zelazny, Edgar Allen Poe and yes, even Frederick Dannay/Manfred Lee. This book is first in a series I highly recommend reading. It's about a private detective who works on cases that delve into ""otherworldy"" places. The characters are vivid and unique...to say the least. There's plenty of action, adventure, and all kind of creepy crawlies to boggle your imagination.It's like a cross between Clive Barkers fantasy books, Roger Zelazny's Amber Chronicles, and Ellery Queen novels.Go out, buy it and read it!"
3,How the U.S. Rose to Become a Global Superpower,"History gives its viewers a brief overview of the history, geography, socio-economics, and politics of each of the 50 states of the Union in the first three DVDs of the set under review. Some viewers will probably be left ""hungry"" for a more in-depth account of some states of particular interest to them. In the fourth DVD of this production, History offers its audience a more thorough coverage of three milestones in the history of the Nation, i.e., the Louisiana Purchase, the Lewis & Clark Expedition, and the Mexican-American War. In summary, this DVD set is a good didactic tool to know more about the U.S."
4,Good for sub days,"I am a high school social studies teacher and I purchased this for substitute days or just as an add-in to US History lesson plans. You could probbaly find use for it in a geography, government or civics class as well. Its a cute DVD that includes interesting facts about each state. I'm not sure about the sequential order of the states though - its not alphabetical, and its also not done by when the states entered the Union. That's my only complaint, that there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the order the states are discussed!"
1,Defective out of the box,"I bought the ""2 fer the price of 1"" units. 1 for me, 1 for my folks in New England so they can see my daughter via the video phone. Seems like a good deal, right? The 2 pairs arrived to me in the Midwest. I kept one and shipped the other to New England. My folks and I set up our units only to discover their unit is defective and does not power up when plugged in. Great! Terrific! Now my folks have to repack and ship the defective unit to me. I then have to re-repack it and send it with my working unit back to Amazon. By the time we factor in all of the extra postage required for the returns and the forwarding this dual deal is hardly worth it. We are going to try again and I've ordered a replacement pair. I guess I'm a sucker. Is it too much to expect this product to work? Buyer beware. And patient."
2,Costly repair,"I bought two units of the beamer and sent one to my family. Turn out one unit is defective - something wrong with the camera. If I send it back to Vialta for repair, they charge me close to $100 + shipping. I think this is a ridiculous amount, as it is almost enough to get a new one."
1,They call this video,Simply doesn't work. Tried on number phone line connections. Definitely not video - at best can use for a snapshot of the person on the other end.
3,One Frame per 3-4 seconds on a good call.,"I was excited when I ordered this product because it said ""8-15 Frames per second,"" however after using it, this turns out to be a complete lie. I'm lucky to get one frame per 3-4 seconds. Nevertheless, it's still nice, particularly since it works directly out-of-the-box."
1,not worth the money,"My daughter and son in law bought the Vialta, and then I bought one. My son in laws family lives in England and for a very short time, they all worked. The quality was poor and the connection would cut out. Now, nothing works, none of the the products communicate, and they went out at the same time. Very very serious loss of money and a way to communicate. I do not recommend this product to anyone who is interested in on line communication.They the web video came, set a skype internet account, and you will find this a better way to stay in touch."
1,GARBAGE,This video phone is the biggest garbage in the world. I bought one it is a waste of money. Video quality is horrible and cheap!! U will not be happy with this. I also have a motorola OJO video phone. That is much better than this. If your gonna get a video phone get the OJO. The price is higher but the video quality is superb!!
2,Vialta Beamer-Not worth it!,"My wife and I are separated and we thought the Beamer would be the perfect choice to bridge our distance. No way! The video at best, is so pixelated and time lagged that the little tiny screen barely shows who or what you're looking at. Never has it been in ""real time"" and it's no better then the first web cams that came out on the internet six years ago. I've done my diagnostics and it's the Beamer, not my phone line or connection.It's not a video phone; it's a waste of time, waste of money, waste of extra phone call charges from when it ""connects"", and most of all, a great dissapointment for two people who are apart."
1,Vialta fails out of the box - test before sending to grandma,"WARNING - test BOTH Beamers before sending one to Grandma. I ordered the dual set and BOTH Beamers are defective. Plug them in and NOTHING, no image. I get a dial tone but absolutely no ""Beamer is now ready"" message, just a blank screen (yes I plugged it in and tested it on several power outlets and several different phone lines).I have sent an irate message to Vialta support and told them what a defective product they are selling.Now I have to have my mother's assistant package up her unit and ship it to me so that I can ship it back to Amazon. For a product that is INTENDED to be shipped far away for long-distance communication, you would think that Vialta would test their products more thoroughly."
2,you get what you pay for,"This recording of Symphonie Fantastique is full of pedestrian tempos and less-than enthustiastic playing. For a much superior recording, pick up the Philadelphia Orchestra recording with Muti conducting. That is a much better value, and the recording is still budget. The excerpts from Damnation of Faust are about the same. The sluggish tempo of the March destroys its effect and the Dance never really gets dancing. The Romeo & Juliet is by far the best portion of this CD and I don't really have any particular complaints about it. If you want to pay four bucks for a good recording of the Love Scene from Romeo and Juliet, this is your chance. Aside from that, look elsewhere."
4,More than you pay for,"The sonic quality is not quite what you'd get in a more recent recording. The Symphonie (by Cluytens, I presume) is precise and fiery. The Love Scene (Giulini, probably) lacks sentiment but has a great cello section."
3,Good enough.,"I buy this product for my 5 yrs old daughter. She enjoys it toasted with butter or cream cheese. I use it for her ""pizza"", too. Slightly toasted, topped with tomato sauce, cheese and olive oil and under the broiler for a minute or so just until the cheese is melted. Just like my daughter says:""Delicious!""."
2,OK for every day use.,"These mugs are fine for every day use, but are not as nice as the original, made in England, Franciscan Earthenware. The detail on the China made Earthenware can not compare to the original."
2,"works well, fits badly","I've used the envirosept filters before and they work well, but this one fits poorly - it is a full 1/2"" too small in both directions."
3,Where are the African American Polly's??,"My daughter loves her Polly pocket sets. This one in particular is a favorite. But I am really disturbed by how difficult it is to find African American Polly's. Mattel has made ""Shani"" who is their African American Polly, but she is only available in a select number of sets which makes her hard to find. Even in the Postcard Pals, which are supposed to represent a variety of nationalities, the only non-caucasion representation that Mattel has choosen is Mexico and Japan. In today's diverse world, one would expect companies to show more of a variety in their products. I'm disappointed in Mattel!"
3,Too white!,"Let me preface this with stating that I am caucasion and am very dissapointed that most of the Polly Pockets are too. Where are the veriations in beige/brown that exist in the world's skin colors????? Changing the hair color is good, now let's address the skin!"
5,My favorite sports bra,"I run about 5 times a week and tried a ton of different ""high impact"" sports bra made for D cup women and they either were uncomfortable, chafed, or didn't hold the girls up securely. Until I found this bra. I love that it doesn't have underwires, which I find chafe no matter what material the bra is made of. The racer back design gives support without squishing your boobs so tight to your chest you can't breath. I love this bra and it's now the only one I wear during high impact activity."
3,Sports Bra,"This bra looks nice & supportive, but I could not even get it on. It is not true to size, plus it does not open all the way so I couldn't get my boobs in it! I was very disappointed, I think this was made for smaller breasted women."
1,If I could -- I would,As always with champion the details are beautiful .. except one. This design is near impossible to get on and off. I sent it back.
3,Ouch,"This is a wonderfully supportive bra IF you can get it on over your head. Did not realize it did not open in the front as most do, but once on it is comfortable and supportive."
4,Rusty & Buttons Christmas Train,"One of my favorite old cartoons. I only wish it was in DVD format. However, I am happy to get in any format."
4,Good book if you read Chinese,"I was a little surprised when I received this book and all the writing was in Chinese, and traditional Chinese calligraphy at that! If you can read the calligraphy it's a great book with lots of pictures and brush painting samples."
3,Eh,"Bought it as a gift. Some of the stitching wasn't that great and fairly noticeable. The person I gave the gift to was happy, so it was all okay in the end."
4,Cthulhu Calls,"This plush is great! I received the toy vault version and its roughly 12"", true to the description. Really cute and evokes a certain feeling of creepiness, like a great old one is watching over u! It is soft, has beanie-filled tentacles/body, and bendable wingspan. A perfect companion when reading those eeiry H.P. Lovecraft stories under the covers!"
5,Plush Old One.,"To start with; I bought this as a gift for my son who was turning seven, He's had his little mind twisted by Herbert West and Cthulhu for a while as I have been reading him Lovecraft as bedtime stories. The plush Cthulhu was almost a gag gift! The toy is quite detailed, soft and as far as I can tell really well made. Out of the box my son was having Cthulhu devour the minds of other plush toys like Domo and Pooh Bear; Too Funny! Right now Cthulhu is lurking somewhere in my house, and with the use he's getting I would say it was money well spent."
4,Some days it's good to have a Great Old One by your side,"I bought this on a lark, as a ""mascot"" for my work team while we were going through a reorganization pilot. It had the intended effect, causing folks to chuckle as we entered a period of uncertainty. Unfortunately, the uncertainty ended about mid-day, as management decided to blow up the organization, and a lot of folks found out they no longer had jobs. Sort of took the fun out of the day.Since then, Cthulhu has occupied a place in my home, where it doesn't do a whole lot. It does, however, occasionally act as a conversation starter (the normal conversation starts out something like ""What the heck is THAT!?!?..."")So, no, it won't cure any horrible diseases or prevent foreclosure or make you a lot of money in 30 days or less. What it does is to provide a few minutes of mirth in an otherwise drab and dreary day. Which, after all, is the purpose of a toy - isn't it?"
4,"Adorable, but varies from image","This toy is great for any Lovecraft admirers - a fun description on the tag and a plush green Elder God. However, my plush is a bit different from the item's description even though they are the same toy according to the model number. The one I have is a more vibrant green with an oval body and shorter tentacles - it does not look as soft as its image in the description.It is a great buy, but the image for it is a tad bit misleading."
2,Only improvment I see is in skin,"I bought this product mainly for my hair which is very very thin and since having my son 15 months ago is still falling out in clumps to where my shower is clogged on the daily. I understand hair falls out within the first year after giving birth but come on its been 3 months and Im still losing grips of it.I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and have noticed my skin brighter and clearer from acne. the brighter part may also be because its summer and Ive gotten some sun. My nails have always been very strong and grow very fast, so no notice there (besides I cut my nails) my hair however has had more of a thicker consistency to it which Ive only had while being pregnant so thats a plus to this product. But in terms of hair loss or growth, no change for me.Everyone is different though, every body is different, so maybe this can work for you.I will keep searching for a product that may help, my next stop is ovation."
5,Great Product!,"I purchased these vitamins a little over a month ago. The company I ordered from (Costsell) sent them promptly. The pills are easy to swallow and I started taking them immediately. I am already noticing a better glow to my skin and nail growth, although I bought them specifically for my hair. My thinning hair has stopped shedding. Too early for me to say for certain that I see new growth. I sure do think so.Love the ingredients--vitamins and an herbal blend. What I can say for certain is that I will be buying more when these run out."
4,Pretty good,"My nails appear a little stronger, I don't no if it is because of the supplement or because I am taking better care of them. My hair also appears a little stronger."
1,Dead after just one month!,"Cons: This is the second WD Hard Drive to die after just one month of operation. It cost us $155 to have a Tech shop interpret the error codes from the ""Blue Screen of Death,"" to determine that the problem was a defective one month old Western Digital Hard Drive. Model: WD Caviar BlueWe had to pay WD are own shipping charges to return WD's defective Hard Drive + the $155 Tech shop repair bill for their analysis of the Hard Drive error codes that came up on the Blue Screen of Death Screen.Other Thoughts: We realize that no Hard Drive company's product is perfect. But, after this second bad experience with this model of Western Digital Hard Drive, we are going to try our luck with a different manufacturer's Hard Drive.Since the Western Digital Hard Drive is defective, we should not have to pay WD to return their defective product. WD should have a policy to compensate all shipping charges, once they are able to verify that their Hard Drive is indeed defective."
2,18 months: kaput,"I bought this disk in January 2009. It sat in the box until June 2009. It got very light use for three months and then sat unused until June 2010. After one week the system wouldn't boot. I am now running CheckDisk. The file check routine has had to repair hundreds of files. Luckily, the files are all backed up."
4,good !!,"lots of people dosnt like WD... i dont like it too.. but its very cheap, and works fine.so if you are running very important things or documents, dont store them in a WD. lol.i am taking risk here, because this is my primary storage device, and i have lots of work. but dont have money for a better HD, this is like an act of faith.working pretty nice so far. hope it does much much longer."
4,Works Like It Should - No Problems!,"I have never installed an SATA II drive before. I had to go online to get the instructions, and I had to buy a cable, but after that, the installation was easy and there have been no problems. They really should throw in the cable with the drive."
1,Lasted 49 days,"Got this on the 7th of Jan, and it worked great. Today is now the 27th of Feb and after 5hours of investigating what was causing repeated lockups and frequent freezes on my OS, the culprit reared it's ugly head to be THIS hard drive. I don't know what caused it's now deteriorating health but I'm now on the risk of losing +400gb of important data. I enjoy these exciting times of my life.. If you want to take the chance on the HD good luck."
1,Harddrive crashed less than a month after purchase and installation,Within a month of installation the harddrive crashed. Very disappointed that the harddrive crashed so soon. Usually do not have these kinds of problems with Western Digital harddrives.
4,"Decent Drive, Reasonably Priced, Quick Two-Day Service","I needed a hard drive fairly quickly to replace a damaged one in a friend's computer, so I ordered it via Amazon Prime, and got it two days after ordering.It's given my friend no problems so far, and is zippier than the ""Green Drive"" she had in there as a C: drive, which would ""save energy"" by slowing to a crawl when she was working...."
2,Didn't work well with my Pentium 4,"I bought this item for my Pentium 4 computer. When I partitioned to 80 GB and installed Windows XP, the system went extremely slow. Computer could start up but hung after 3-4 hour usage. I suspect the Hard disk is faulty or may be my PC is too old to handle a 640GB H/D. Later I bought a 320 GB from a retail shop and it worked perfectly.I returned this item but Amazon.com, handled the return professionally. I appreciate their service."
3,Works fine but HOT!,"It does what its supposed to but gets very HOT if you don't have a fan right on it! Don't touch it, or you WILL be burned!"
5,Great Hard disk,"I bought this to deposit video on after recording it from a TV tuner. It was used as an internal SATA drive, and I filled it up at one point. It withstood numerous recordings and then renderings as I edited out commercials and created my personal collection. It is now in an external case and connected to my laptop via USB 2.0 and still works fine. We play videos off of it through the network. I will say that when I got it, it had trouble initializing, but the included software solved that problem. It has worked wonderfully since then under what I would consider to be pretty rigorous use."
1,"Great drive, but packed by an idiot","Bought yet another pair of these for general backup use (we like this drive a lot - as a drive it is great) and as noted by others, this is just a naked OEM drive. But this time the two drives arrived in a huge 2 foot long box with a light bit of packing and, having been tossed about in shipping, the anti static envelopes are covered with dimple marks from the impacts of the rough handling. Yes the warranty should still protect me, but now I have two unit that will need to be watched due to the ""pre stress"" that Firemall LLC added to the process. Not at all happy about that part of the transaction."
4,replacement hd,"I used this for a replacement to a Iomega external drive.It was a snap, works like a charm. Reformated to use on iMac."
5,Works great as an external hard drive for back ups. Don't need SATA port.,"Vantec NexStar 3 NST-360SU-BK 3.5-Inch SATA to USB 2.0 and eSATA External Hard Drive Enclosure (Onyx Black)Works as expected. Quite. Heat and vibration have not been a problem. These bulk/OEM drives are perfect for enclosures. I used the linked case and it works great. Don't need any cables, screws or jumpers with an enclosure. Cheaper than buying an external hard drive plus gives me the flexibility to use the enclosure with other drives or install this one in another machine. I like it!"
4,Hard drive review,"I have only had this drive running for about 3 weeks now but so far am very satisfied with it. I have had several Western Digital drives before and for the most part have been dependable. The only problem I have with the purchase is the way the product was packaged and shipped, in a box with a air filled shipping pillow. The drive itself was in the typical static bag, but otherwise no protection."
5,New hard drives,Replaced 160gb security raid array with a pair of 640gb drives. Hard to believe you can buy 650gb drives for $59. They are working well.
5,Works great in my 2007 20 inch iMac,This drive works great in my iMac. Installing anything in the iMac is quite a painful process due to the amount of work needed to get to the drive. I would recommend having a 2nd set of hands to help with lifting the LCD and such if you're doing any sort of replacement for the iMac.
3,Right price,The hard drive worked great I had to go online to get the product manuals and purchase the cables since it is a SATA II drive and my computer supports SATA I it took me several hours to make it work but once I figured out how to slow down the drive with the jumper which was not supplied it was a plug and play process. Make sure you know your system specifications before you order and get the needed cables and jumper & Screws all at once.
5,"Big, Fast, and Quiet","Not a lot to say here, but this drive is very quiet, very fast, and keeps quite cool. I work in the business and we actually carry this exact model and so far we haven't had hardly any come back with problems. I bought mine here because Amazon's price is cheaper than what my ""adjusted cost"" is at work. I have 4 drives in my machine and have only used Western Digital. I have 2 Raptors and 2 of these 500GB. If you are looking for a big drive that's also quiet and reliable look no further. Oh, 5 out of 5 eggs in the reviews over at Newegg..."
4,magnifici,ahora si tendre gran poder de almacenamiento y podre grabar hasta mis clasicos de peliculas ¡¡¡ viva hugo chavez ¡¡¡ viva venezuela ¡¡
2,"It's not made very well. Too fragile, not for a traveller. Waste of money! Buy an ipod instead.","Too Fragile - be prepared to lose everything you store on it.I bought this to take with me on a international trip. I used it to store pictures, movies and music as well as to transfer stuff from one computer another. It did a great job with everything ,but it is not packed very well. It fell off the kitchen table to the floor (about 4ft) and that was it. I could not access anything on it anymore. It is not recognizable to any computer anymore. I lost everything I had on it. I wish I would of got an Ipod or something more reliable. I know an ipod can take a small fall and still work, I know several people that have dropped their ipod and it still works fine, they don't break so easily.In my opinion it was a waste of good money to buy this. It's just too delicate for a normal person to use. I handled it carefully, but accidents happen."
1,Bad quality and bad customer service,"I purchased this model about a year ago, and it comes with 5 years manufacturer warranty. Recently I found somehting wrong with this HD and contacted with WD customer service, after several emails back and forth, I downloaded WD diagnostics utility, and got the report ""too many bad sectors"".Then I was told by customer service that I need to ship the bad HD by myself and have it replaced. It is ridiculous, think about the market value of this HD around $60 to $80, but I need to pay another $20 to $30 to ship it. And who knows how long the HD will last again.I dealt with HP/Compaq warranty regarding the defective laptop before, they basically sent out a package with postage paid already and I don't need to pay anything. A much better way to handle warranty."
3,I tend to have problems with WD disk surface,"Bought a WD5000AAJS and a WD5000AAKS at almost the same time. Within 3 weeks, the AAKS started to have bad sectors after disk scan, and since it was still under warranty, I had it replaced. Now its been 3 months since then, and another disk scan found more bad sectors on both the AAJS and AAKS. Never had such problems with my older boxes (maxter hdds in them)."
1,Failed Immediately,"Windows 7 started popping up error messages the first time I copied data to this drive. SeaGate SeaTools tested it and determined it would die soon.If you are like me and count 1 star reviews to try to determine how likely the drive is to be a dud, here is one more to throw into the pile."
1,Piece of junk,"This hard drive gets very hot, very quickly, and then start to fail, I bought it half and a year ago, and I don't use it so much, but now is failing in the big way :( I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS HARD DRIVE, at least you want to lose some files... it get bad sectors now... and I have 4 drives more of different capacities an none of those drives failed... but this is the new one, and the worst... don't ever buy it... or you will sorry in a future... I don't get advice of all reviews and now I'm paying for it. :'(...My drive: Western Digital 500GB 3.5"", SATA, 16MB Cache Bulk/OEM Hard Drive WD5000AAKS"
5,Great value on the latest tech,"At 500GB this is a reasonably large capacity drive by today's standards, yet very low-priced, about 10 cents/GB including shipping. Though they're always 500GB with a 16MB cache there have been several generations of the WD5000AAKS originally with more platters. Recently the WD5000AAKS drives I've received are single-platter which lowers the weight, noise, heat and power consumption slightly. Sustained sequential read throughput now seems to be upwards of 120MB/sec (maybe 10-15% higher than the last two-platter version) and is basically the same as the Caviar Black WD5001AALS 500GB drive. As it should though, the Caviar Black outperforms the Blue on random access. These are so cheap now that it's easy to justify running extra drives so that you have a backup."
1,Beware: sudden failure after 2 months,"Like other people here, I had no trouble at all with my WD hard drive until one morning it suddenly, unexpectedly died. A steady clicking sound meant drive head failure -- mechanical trouble that, in two seconds, wiped out 500GB of data.Buy all the cheap WD hard drives you want, but make sure everything on them is backed up!"
3,Drive works ok but vibrates too much,I don't know if it's just the one I received but mine vibrates more than normal and causes my computer case to make noise. I think I got a defective one because HDDs are NOT supposed to vibate too much especially 7200 rpm drives. It sounds like the platters or something inside is not balanced hence the vibration. The drive itself does not rattle or anything but it vibrates.
2,a bit shaky,"The quality is a bit shaky. Bought one and started to see bad sectors within 3 weeks. Had a replacement, and noticed the drive would fail to mount from time to time and had to reboot the computer a few times to make the drive show up(maybe something with vista, I am not sure). A couple months later, more bad sectors."
1,Month of the living dead hard drive,"First hard drive was dead, too many bad sectors, but the were in the middle of the disk, so I didn't know until I tried to copy files to the drive. Returned it to WD and got a replacement, that one was dead. Returned it, next one was dead. I call WD to complain, they upgraded it to a 640 HD and paid for the return shipping. New drive came and it was dead also. Called and complained again. Now they are sending me a 750Gb HD, but the shippment is delayed. So I got my first HD at the beginning of Dec. and now it's into Jan. and I still don't have a working one. I've bought WD hard drives before and they worked fine, but I'm not going to buy another one for a while. These have all been their blue models, maybe their black models are better."
3,Noiser than CPU fans,"The performance is OK.It's hot.Its vibration is too much and cause the whole case to resonant vibrate. That makes lots of noise, bigger than all fans in my case."
4,Easy Setup for Older MAC Desktop,"Installing, formatting and partitioning the WD6400AAKS in my late-2004 vintage PowerMac G5 was a breeze. I bought it to increase the storage capacity rather than the speed of one of my two internal drives. To ensure compatibility with the older computer, I installed a jumper to reduce the maximum transfer rate from 300MB/s to the first generation SATA maximum of 150MB/s. (This may have been unnecessary.) Even with this modification, benchmark tests show read/write speeds, both sustained and random, for the new WD drive ranging from 30% to 60% faster than with my second drive in the same computer, a Seagate 160GB SATA I model. I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars only because it is too soon to judge its durability. So far it exceeds my expectations, and the price was great. Amazon service also was great."
1,"Worked for a while, then disintegrated...","I had this drive installed in a desktop until a couple of weeks ago when I suddenly got a drive read error. Pulled the drive and it sounds like it's full of sand. Platter self-destructed spectacularly with no warning. It's under warranty, but I wonder what the next drive will do. At least I don't have to worry about security of info on the drive when I send it in. The drive was only about 8 months old. Very disappointed."
5,"cheap, fast, and runs cool","This hard drive is a great buy, also WD 1 TB drives get good reviews too from my friend.It also runs 2 degrees C cooler than my seagate drive, which means it must be more energy efficient and reliable."
5,Help pls about how do I know if this is the right device for my laptop?,My laptop says ATA device..........it does not say 1 ATA nor 11 ATA//////////although it has the number of it......WDC WD800BEVS-22RST0 ATA Device pls help!!!!!email me [...]
5,"Works fine, lasts a long time","This is a reasonably fast drive, has been reliable, and just works. It seems to me that a middle-of-the-road hard drive is at its best when does what it's supposed to. This drive seems to do just that."
5,Quiet Drive,Very Quiet Drive. Doesn't run hot. averaging temps at 31-33 C.I am using it as part of a 3 drive RAID. Too soon to tell about long term stability obviously.
1,Many other choices - I don't recommend this drive,"I purchased this drive from Amazon. It lasted a little over a year, then died. Since I had been using Western Digital drives exclusively since I started building computers in the late 1990s, I assumed that this was a fluke, and I purchased and installed another one, same model as the one that died. The second one lasted a year and a month before it also died. That's it for me - one failure could be a fluke, but two virtually identical failures is a design and/or quality problem. I am now through with Western Digital. Something has apparently changed, and not for the better. If you do buy this drive, you better be very sure that your data is backed up somewhere else..."
1,I need to return this crap,"It is not often that I am robbed without a weapon pressed against me, but this was one of the occasions."
1,AMAZON NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO PACK SENSITIVE MATERIAL,"Amazon shipped this hard drive as if it were not a sensitive computer accessory. Airbags were half inflated, some not inflated at all. Box containing hard drive was directly at the bottom with no proctection under it and able to move from side to side, only had 'protection' at the top. I sent it back, didn't want to even test the hard drive. Even if it worked, it would probably malfunction a lot quicker than it would have if it were packaged correctly."
2,Just the Drive,"This drive ships from Amazon without ANY cables or documentation. There is nothing in the package except the drive. (All you get is what is shown in the picture -- the drive.) In order to have any chance to get this drive you work, you must go on the WD web site (a pain to navigate) and download two critical pieces of software before you begin the install. You need the Data Lifegaurd Tools software and the Diagnostics software. Install both before you begine the install of the drive. If you are replacing a boot drive, you need the software on CD. Good luck!"
3,Large drive caveat,"Linux saw the 500GB with out any problem. Windows 2K only sees 128GB. If you want one large partition you will need Windows XP SP2 or above, so I've been told."
3,No cables,You may have to know someone to get this working. Doesn't come with the needed cable to the mother board.Luckily I knew someone that works on PCs and so he let me have an extra cable that I needed to get this HD working.OH-this is not replacing a hardrive ... which in that case the cable from the old HD could be used.
1,Buyer Beware,"I followed a link on Amazon that said best price on 1TB hard drive. Read the model number... this is a 250 gig drive, NOT 1TB although you can't tell that anywhere on the sale page except by the model number. Don't buy if your expecting a 1TB hard drive. Good luck."
2,Compre 4 discos y uno salio malo,"La mercancia llego bien, lamentablemente 1 de los 4 discos que compre no funciono y por estar en otro pais, se me dificulta aplicar la garantia."
1,Sadly it crashed after four days.,Have always seen good things with WD products but sadly this one crashed after four days -- failing in its very purpose to act as a backup drive.
2,3rd Failure - Not Recommended,"My third drive of this model has just died. The only thing that has saved me each time was that my system is running a RAID1 setup otherwise I would have had to rebuild my system each time. I have previously replaced the failed drive with an identical unit to make it easy to replace in the RAID setup. Not this time, I will be imaging my system and copying it to a new pair of drives of a different model."
5,Working Good!,"I build desktop computers for my friends. This is the 4th WD hard drive that I bought. I have not any problems with WD. I am using this 500g as a primary drive and it is working properly. Placed it inside the case, loaded it with Windows 7 and my desktop started up without a hitch. A bonus, it is very quiet."
4,"Fast, quiet, and spacious...","Just got this drive, you will have to format it before use, but I experienced no issues at all. No bad sectors, no trouble.This thing is fast and quiet. Very happy with it so far...I've taken the time to really get a good healthy install on it and it has paid off. I'll follow up if anything changes, but as of right now I am 100% happy with this purchase!Also, received this in a little under 2 days! Great shipping, packaging was professional - shock mounted drive, original WD box inside of a larger box."
5,Works fine for me,"I bought this drive to use for my Windows 7 backups. It arrived in good shape and formatted easily using Windows 7 disk manager. I connected it with a SATA/USB drive adapter from Cables to Go. Works great, drive is quiet and cool, and I can store it in a fireproof location so my backups are safe."
4,Review the description of the publication.,Amazon should clarify the information in this article because the WD5000AAKS model corresponds to a SATA hard disk and not a SATA II.I am sure that Amazon will review this publication.
3,Power connections might be different than you think,"Check the Power Connectors in your device, this drive has no ""Legacy Power Connector"" (Western Digital's Term) on it. You can buy an adapter cable for less than $1.00 for power - but you chould check before ordering this disk.You should also know that this disk does not include any ""SATA"" cable either."
2,Broken Package. Slow processing/shipping time,"The plastic packaging inside the box was cracked, and the drive was sliding across the box freely when i opened it. The drive seems fine, though i am nervous it might fail soon due to damage, i would return it but don't want the trouble. All my previous amazon items purchase have been perfect with no trouble. I don't want to be fussy either, but the delivery promised 3 days, i just want to note it took 10 days for delivery."
1,DSAA (Dead Shortly After Arrival,Plugged it in to my NAS drive setup for a RAID 1 configuration. It started working then quickly died.
2,Died on me 3 months later,"Died on me, not for sure if it was from a virus and whiped out sectors, Norton did find some junk the day before it died, but said it got rid of it all...."
2,Others got the anme and others got the charisma...,"I have spent LOTS of cash on hard drives and i happen to work in a huge electronics store. They got computers, mobile phones, gadgets, hard drives and sometimes things break down. We got western digital drives as well and i noticed that 4 out of 20 are returned from customers because they crush!!! Samsung hard drives never come back after they get sold. Thats what i noticed at my work and before i posted this i got also the technicals support guys opinion and also now my personal expirience. I have a samsung hard drive for 4 years and i started to get worried in case it crushes down and i loose all my data. So i went and got a western digital. I had it three months and it worked slow and after crushed. I threw him out of my window. My samsung still running. Overall? This hard drives are a waist of money. Thanks"
1,Junk,"We purchased this drive May 2010, and we can't say anything good about it.First, we tried to format it on Windows XP - no deal, Windows kepttelling us ""This drive cannot be formatted"".So we tried Windows Vista, SP2. Nothing.Windows 7. Nothing again.We can't say it was DOA, because the drive showed upon the system and was spinning.Western Digital is moving away from Windows XP, and developingdrives that work exclusively with Windows 7. We can't saythat this drive was one of these ""special"" 4k size drives(There was no specifications on the website on this model sayingso).We no longer sell Western Digital hard drives here at ourfirm. We'll stick with Hitachi, Seagate and Samsung.Daniel James Tyler (Danxo) TheWJ Group."
3,Good for the price,"Bottom line is only 465 GB total capacity, but it works as expected, and the price is fair enough."
2,Problems setting up as Boot Drive - don't expect any help,"Drive seems to work well mechanically, after I bought ($5) another new SATA cable. The problem was that the WD software was not able to create a new boot drive either in Windows or DOS. I was able to copy a boot onto an older small EIDE drive, but not onto this SATA. (?)Western digital support was absolutely no help - they blamed the problem on Dells software and recommended that I purchase third party software to clone.Plan on another up to $50 on software to be able to use this drive."
1,Unhappy,"I never received this item. After many days, I was notified the item had been returned because it was ""undeliverable"". There is no reason the item should have been returned. I order technology items on a regular basis from many vendors and have delivery made to my home office with no problem. The lack of communication from Amazon.com was very disheartening. I'm not sure I will order from Amazon.com again."
1,SLOWEST SHIPPING EVER,"I ordered over a week ago and it still says ""shipping soon."" i could have learned how to solder one from scratch by now. how hard is it to put stuff in a box? i would cancel the order if i could and just one at best buy or something if i hadnt already made this grave error. ordered other products on newegg the same day and already received them. my $500 worth of other components that were delivered are USELESS until amazon gets its act together. will in the future incur the few extra dollars cost to avoid the inconvenience. by ""super saver"" they definitely don't mean time."
2,What A Pain,"I should have read the prior reviews more closely. Yup, no cable, CD program, instructions, just nothing but drive. You better know BIOS and computers well or you'll wind up with less hair by pulling it out. At least I had mounting screws in my garage. With my luck the darn thing will be a faulty drive I suppose. Don't expect any help from Amazon besides returns. Amazon just ships not explains. At least my friend told me were in the setup you have to go to turn on drive 1 port. GGGGGRRRRRRRRR. If you need help, go to the Western Digital web site."
1,sold as new arrived used,This HD was sold to me as new and arrived used with no hardware or paperwork then Amazon charged me for the return
1,Talk about bare bones!!!!,This drive came in a plastic wrapped cardboard. No Manual. No instructions. No Cables. No nothing.I instantly returned it to Amazon for a refund.Bought the Seagate 300GB and now I am happy
4,Western Digital HD,"The first HD that I received ended up being defective. Other than that, it was easy to setup on my Dell Inspiron Desktop. It was a very simple plug and play since I was replacing a hard drive that went bad."
5,"IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER COMPUTER, Please read:","If you get a ""Hardware Initiate Failed!"" comment with this HDD, your computer is only SATA 1.0 compatible and you must jumper pins 5 and 6 to revert the HDD to 1.0(second pair of pins from the SATA connector). Since this is an 'OEM' item devoid of instructions and the like, I had no way to know this and thought it was DOA. So, I ordered a replacement. When the second one also came DOA, I knew it couldn't be the HDD's. The possibility of getting 2 DOA Western Digital HDD's is pretty much 0. Once I figured everything out, I decided to keep both."
4,Too bad this song was dropped from the album,Love this track. Basically reminds you of the best Prince mid tempo tracks from the late 80s. Check this out. Play it in the club and everyone will be up from the first bar.
3,the 3D is converted,"defiantly old style 3D conversion.story is ok might be good for some kids but not all.the 3D in this requires an active 3D tv, passive 3D will not do you much good (although some of this might look some what ok on a passive 3D tv).also some might not be able to play the 3D in this cause not all 3D tv's have a wide compatibility of older style 3D. if you tv supports field sequential 3D it will work.as long as your bluray player supports 3D dvd's...might have to convert to sbs to get it to work)"
5,BRONCOS KNIT BEANIE,THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. IT ARRIVED BEFORE CHRISTMAS. THE RECIPENT WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE GIFT.
4,Great Resource,I read several reviews on different Network+ books before I bought this one. The reviews I read on this one were accurate. It is a good resource. It had a few typos and a few test yourself answers were wrong based off from what I had read in the chapter but other than that it really was easy reading and covered the topics well.The Total Seminar Practice Exams that come on the CD only allow you to take two practice exams and two Final exams. The company that provides the passwords for the other exams is now out of business.I highly recommend this book.
4,It's enough to help you pass,"I knew about 10% of the material covered on this exam before reading this book. I had great success with Meyers' A+ Exam Guide and figured this would be just as great. The typos and obvious errors in the book are annoying and they also exist in the tests on the CD-ROM. I also purchased the Exam Cram Network+ practice tests for additional tests. Fully understanding all the material I scored 85%. I found the questions relatively easy compared to the actual exam. I would recommend the Transcender website for anyone looking for better questions to challenge you for a higher grade, but this book is enough if you just want to get a passing grade. Passing grade is 82% the book has the old value of 68%."
2,Good Information but not enough to pass the test.,I taught with this book and had students study with it. Great for beginners but not enough information to pass the exam.
2,Very dissapointed in Mr. Meyers again. And the price!,"If you just need to learn the finer points of DNS or the inner workings of ethernet, you don't need this book. All you need is the web and a search engine. I was very dissapointed in this book because (like Mr. Meyers A+ book) three of every four pictures is insultingly, worthlessly simple. On page 17 for example is a picture of two human figures talking at the same time with a caption that reads ""Two people talking at the same time can tell that they are not the only ones talking."" Well, REALLY?! I'm not kidding. Granted it's a very simplified way to illustrate the basics of CSMA/CD but it takes up one-third of the page, and this is common. This 530 page book should only really be about 250 pages long. There is SOME good information in here, but I found the same information on the web for free. If you are completely new to the feild, Mr. Meyers two books are okay. But JUST okay."
3,Errata Corrige please!,"Between the so much present errors in the book, I believe that most serious it is that to page xxiii of the introduction where it assert that the pass score is of the 68%. The pass score of the examination is instead of the 82%, that it in practical terms implicates a very better difficulty. Is obvious that, it could not restrain responsible the author if anybody doesn't overcome the examination. But prepare in base to an average of the 68% or an of the 82%, creed could influence in the result. I believe am correct and opportune do the corrections of the present errors and add an ERRATA CORRIGE with the dispatch of the book, so that the readers could avoid them."
2,Clearly presented but many errors.,"Today, I have passed with ease the Network+ Exam using this book for my ONLY study material. But I would recommend to use another books for the studying material especially for those who do not have a strong foundation or experience on networking.Strength of this book:1. This books is easy to read and understand, concepts are usually clearly. The 7 layers is well -presented.2. The poster of OSI Seven-layer Model is really nice and useful.Weakness of this book:1. Obviously, this book do not well-proofreaded. Some errors were found.p.63 : 5-4-3 rule is 5 segments, 4 repeaters ...p.76 and 387 : Max. length of 1000BaseFX is 2000mp.11 Figure 1.8 MAC addresses of B & D is incorrectSome other very minor mistakes were found.2. The question is far too simple and the format is not very similar to the question in the real exam.3. Environmental impacts on network is totally missing which is tested in the exam.Alan Chan -- A+, MCSE and Network+"
4,Passed with 850/900,"Hi,Just recently passed N+ exam with 850/900. The only references i used are this book and Coriolis N+ Exam Cram/Prep kit. Also bought CiCprep Exam simulation. I found that Mr. Meyers book is full of examples and analogies that help understand some difficult concepts. On the other hand, there is lots of typos and errors in the tests. But i would not hesitate to recommend this book, but coupled with a more advanced book to balance for the lack of depth of certain concepts. Good luck."
5,Best IT book I've ever read.,"I wish all IT books were written in this manner. I hope they come out with Server+/Linux+ and keep to this format.Simple and fluid writing (ignoring some errors).The pictorials are excellent, to the point and easy to comprehend. It actually made basic to intermediate networking look simple.This book is THE book if you're teaching networking (not advanced networking).It actually made me smirk a few times while reading, the humour keeps your mind fresh. Not to much to make the book look silly.Scoring for the exam is now 750 points out of 900, which comes out to 83.3%.This book and either the Exam Prep or Exam Cram book (depending on experience, Cram if you have 6+ months in Networking, Prep if you have none) and you'll be sure to pass.A+, i-Net+, Network+, CIW Associate."
2,Do not buy this.,"SMCs 2670 bridge will configure ok if you use an SMC wireless router. Any attempt to use DHCP in any different way fails. Unfortunately, my attempt at using this with my ReplayTV with ethernet jack failed miserably. Get a D-Link or Linksys. SMC might have an improved version out by now, but stay away from this one!"
4,Does *almost* everything I want,"I bought this device about a year ago to hook up my TiVo to my wireless network. I had an SMC wireless router, so it seemed a logical fit. The performance was just ""OK"", but nothing to rave about.A month ago, I upgraded my router to a Linksys WRT54G v2 router, and the change was amazing and immediate. All performance issues have vanished and were (obviously) due to the router signal and not the SMC2670W. Very happy now.The only downside is with firmware upgrades... you (I) can't upgrade wirelessly so I was forced to remove the device (from TiVo) and upgrade it via a cross-connect cable attached to my host PC. This is no small feat, mind you, since the SMC2670W power supply is connected behind my entertainment center. SMC has not supplied a new FW update in a while, so hopefully this will not be an issue again."
2,constantly loosing connection,"I have an SMC network at home and I was very happy with it. I recently tried to connect my Xbox to the network. The first 2670 would loose connection after a few hours. I sent it back and replaced it with one that does the same thing only after a little longer. Since my laptop can get steady connection from virutally the same spot, it is not the location (I used the SMC 2632). Also the 2670 does not allow you to do MAC translation - for those who may need it for gaming beware. The only way to reboot is to unplug the freaky little cable at the back - which in my case is on top of the Xbox in a narrow shelf and it is not easily accessible.Regarding their other masterpice, the 2435 cardbus adapter - I tried to replace the 2632 with the 2435 - DONT. The Wireless Manager does not detect the card. I saw a similar review on epinions.com and I did not believe the guy...well its true!!!"
5,Pretty Rug,I like the rug it is very cheerful. The price with shipping was a bit high but I couln't find andy kitchen rugs I liked in the stores.
5,It's beautiful,I love the doormat. It looks just like the picture. The colors are very vibrant. My only disappointment with the vendor was that I ordered a second doormat and was later notified it was out of stock. I might have picked a different second doormat if I had known at the time of placing my order that it wasn't available.
1,Poor Edition,"I have read Henry Lawson for over 50 years and 'While the Billy Boils' is one of my favorites. Unfortunately all the words are there but little else. There is no ability to navigate. Kindle make it hard not giving an indication of the user friendliness of titles. There are several of this name for varying prices , but no indication that if you pay money you will get a better version than this one - it really is buying a pig in a poke. I guess in this case you get what you pay for - nothing for nothing."
3,the rythme of the words remain,"Its an annoying e-book, no navigation etc. But, and its a big But, the words are Henry Lawson, and the rythme of the stories and the words used are pure. It belongs to a time long ago that holds little reality for present time, but its a truth of a time in the Australian past, and should be venerated for that alone. All it really needed was The Loaded Dog, and I would have given it 4 stars."
3,long distance problems,I used the beamer within the USA and had no problems. the best results come with increased lighting. however i took one to europe and have not been able to connect and get a picture yet. if anyone had a solution ...please commentthanks
1,Garbage,"GARBAGE, GARBAGE, GARBAGE - This product does not work with digital phone lines - the customer service is non-existent. Steer clear of this product. It simply did not work for us - and you have to buy to ind out it doesn't work."
5,Excellent Low Cost Solution,Easy to hook up. Very stylish. See family without having to fly. Thanks Vialta!
4,The Dances Are Not Kubelik's With The Choir!!,"The original LP of Kubelik's Vienna Phil. Borodin Symphony 2, also contained a masterful and exciting performance of the Polovtsian Dances with Kubelik again, conducting The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. Oddly, this treasured performance of the Borodin Dances has NEVER found its' way onto a CD. When I first encountered this CD in the shop, I was led to believe I was going to get my old LP replaced with some good bonuses to boot. Though I'm delighted to have Kubelik's Vienna Borodin 2 on CD, I was really bunmmed that I got a choirless Polovtsian Dances with Steinberg and Pittsburgh instead. Owners of the original LP can and will be easily fooled here, for the back of the jewel case indicates Kubelik for The Polovtsian Dances. Only when the enclosed leaflet is read, is the error on the back of the case corrected."
2,Comfortable but doesn't last,"I bought these boots in January 2010. By March, the leather started tearing away from the sole just behind the toe box. It is now Feb 2011 and the small hole is now almost a 4 inch tear alond the inside of the right boot. I bought these shoes based on their comfort. And it is because they were comfortable that I gave them 2 stars instead of 1. The last pair of boots that I bought, I had them for 7 years before they wore out. These didn't make it 3 months before they started to tear up. I will never own another pair of these boots."
3,plastic eyelets,"the shoe is ok, comfortable and light weight. but the eyelets are plastic and already one is broken. not what i expect from dr. martens. it was worth the price i paid, being about half off, but if i paid full price, i would return it."
2,"The book was okay, but not great...","Used for one of my MBA courses.I wish the book had explained more in detail on how one would define an ethical dilemma--Perhaps a step by step approach on how to define and apply the ethical principles would have been beneficial? To me, the book was just a collection of thoughts by various authors.On the bright side chapter 1 explains several of the ethical principles, but it is up to you to understand how to define and apply them.Anyway, use at your own risk."
5,Petticoat,The book was in excellent condition. I was very satisfied. Dr. Marszalek was one of my history professors at MS State & I enjoyed reading his take on the Eaton Affair.
2,Couldn't put it down? No...I could,"Though it's not the worst book I've ever read, I had the hardest time getting past the third chapter. With promises that this book was interesting I was quite disappointed. The book reads like you are reading a geneology chart instead of a book of scandals. It throws in a name, and then EVERY person they are related to, who they are related to and so on. The story is interesting...if you can get past all the [crud]. If you're looking for an interesting book with history you've come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a history book with a few interesting high spots...you'll love it."
5,Great show!,Coach was a very funny situation comedy (imaginative writing is severely lacking in TV comedy today). Coach was clever and a great casting of Jerry Van Dyke and Craig Nelson.
5,LOVE It...........,Love this show!! funny Funny Funny!! cant wait to get the other seasons.....you wont be disappointed~ Great for Family time
4,The Best,I think Coach was one of the best TV comedies that was ever on the air. one laugh after another.
5,super bonus,I purchased this book to complete a collection of hardbacks. It showed up in perfect condition two days earlier than expected. As a bonus it was also a first edition. I couldn't have gotten a better deal! Bidding wars on Ebay have driven the price of first editions like this one to over eighty dollars. I paid twenty.
4,"if you've read the other Polly reviews, I've bought a few of these","They play and they play and they play with them. The accessory pieces, such as shoes, handbags, etc. are very small and get lost over time. But they're still playing."
4,Outstanding Tchikovsky,"I have just encountered this Tchaikovsky performance, on vinyl rather than CD (so I can't speak to the sound here) but as a performance it is excellent. Previn takes his typically rhythmic and light approach to the score, with lilting tempos on the quick side. Taking the war out of a warhorse isn't easy, but everything comes together wonderfully here for these two artists in their prime."
4,"Two Great composed works on one disc,a rare find","It's great to have two well written musical works by the ( Belgium compoesr ) JONGEN & ( french Composer ) Saint-Saens. Both recordings were done well.The tempo was bit to rapid at times.The organ sounded a under used at times. The accoustics sounded a little too controlled , but ok.I have 2 other previous recordings of these 2 works. on the TELARC CD the recording is the best to date. On the GOTHIC CD the recording is enveloping & a bit too revrebrant , because of the accoustics in large bldg. , the Wanamaker organ in the 13 level bldg.Now MACY's. As far as the Saint-Saens recording,I now own about 8 recordings of this work. Highy recomeded TELARC - Ormandy,Phila Orch. / RCA - Ormandy,Phila. Orch. / EMI - Mazzel Pitts.Sym. / Phillips - DeWart SFS / RCA-Living Stereo - Munch,BSO / TELARC - Bedea, RPO. / Ondine - Eschenbach ,Phila. Orch. More reviews later."
2,At least it lasted a week,"This pump filter lasted about a week and half before it started to mess up. It is the second one I have had to purchase, with the first failing a few months after purchase. The only reason I bought this one was that I already had the entire previous unit hooked up and I thought, ""Hey, maybe the last one was just a bad apple."".... NO! Just a piece. Do not buy this product. Instead, just take [$...] bucks and burn it."
4,Good buy for small pools!,This pool pump works great for round 12' pools or smaller. If the the pool is any larger then a twelve foot round and three feet tall this pump will not work for you. Great for small intex pools.
1,GARBAGE!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$,"I had the same filter for 5 years and it finally died. I ordered this filter on May 22, 2010 and it died on June 22, 2010. Conveniently 2 days after the return policy expired. ARRGGGHHHH! It died so suddenly that it actually fried my GFI outlet that it was connected to. The motor is burnt up and plastic is melted. It had been running fine up until this point, roughly four weeks, so I was confident that I had a decent pump. My children are extremely upset as I won't let them in the pool without a filter and I now have to find one that is appropriate for these small pools. What a shame that Amazon is allowing this product to continue being sold with this many problems.Too bad there is not a ""0"" star rating."
1,Bad impeller is design defect,"I have this filter/pump which is sold with many Intex small above ground pools. The pump lasted a year for me, then suddenly stopped working the following year. I thought it may have been some seeds from nearby trees clogging it so I took it apart. I found that the plastic covering around the shaft of the impeller had simply come off over time. A loose piece was still remaining which made it clear the now bare metal was previously covered by plastic. There was no ""fixing"" this. After looking on the internet for a while, the part was not available either. Now I see that many people are complaining about it suddenly stopping. This is due to that design defect and it would be tolerable if the impeller was sold at a cheap price in packs of 3 or more with instruction that it should be changed every few months. Now I have to buy another pump, but at least I just didn't wind up getting this one again."
5,Intex pool pump,"the pump arrived quicker than I though it would and it was exactly the replacement pump that I needed. I thought it was going to be just the pump, but it included the hoses, clamps and a new filter. I thought I would have to salvage hoses off old pump. Now I'm ready when the summer weather gets here!"
2,Disappointing,"This came with my small Intex pool. It has recently died after just a few months. I am looking at the 2,500 pump which has much better reviews.UPDATE: I bought the larger unit that uses the size B filter. So much better and worth every penny."
4,You get what you pay for!,Our family has owner two Intex pools in the last five or six years and the only problem we have had is the pumps end up going bad in about a year or two. Intex has a direct website where the price for this pump was much higher-we did not feel as though we would want to spend a large amount of money on a pump that will in fact quit working in a year. This was perfect for the money. I did not mind spending around $20 dollars for a pump that will eventually quit working becuase the pool will for sure out last the pump. For our family the $20 dollars is well worth it for a summer (3-4 months) of fun.
2,Sucky,This pool pump sucked.after a month it broke i couldint return it cause it was to late my thought is dont buy it youll reagret it
1,DEEDEE,WASTE of money! This item is a piece of junk and not worth the money. The pump is very weak and needless to say you get what you pay for!!!
3,Very Good!!,Worked as indicated. Easy to install. Just plug it in at either end. Good Quality. Haven't had a problem staying in place.
5,DA BOMB!!!,i think that the song is great cause i have there cd single. They are da bomb cause there got much filipino flava. They got the best song in the world. same as kai. much love to all the filipino peoples. much love and flava! bye!
5,Worth The Price For Nimrod Alone,I purchased this CD about 10 years ago and have never tired of hearing it. The Nimrod Variation alone is worth the price of the disc. I have heard it said that the Nimrod Variation is the most beautiful 4 minutes in all of music and it may well be. I would certainly believe that it is the most beautiful 4 minutes in all of British music. There was no greater interpreter of British music than Sir Adrian Boult and you can't go wrong with this recording. Save yourself $10-15.00 you might spend on a more recent recording of the Enigma Variations and purchase this disc. The other compositions on the disc are some of Elgar's best known works and fill out the program nicely.
2,a hit!!,"you`ll have a total different look the next time when going to the aquarium, good job well done. highly recommended."
3,Not a bad product,"We bought this product and it is heavy duty. It is not for one person to put on and is difficult to remove too. It does keep the trailer out of the weather which is nice. We just put it on for the second time and the product ripped on the corner. It caught on the awning and tore a hole in it. We will fix it because the product is worth it but, be prepared for some difficulty putting it on and taking it off. It is a little harder than I imagined it would be."
5,"Brilliant, and ahead of its time as well","How to cover a worthwhile subject (the correct use of technology) with humour rather than boring the pants off people in the first 3 pages. Some clever ideas on how life really could be simpler all round, plus some good jokes - what more do you want?I may be slightly biased, because I wrote it!!!"
3,not as useful as others,I found this book to deal less with the practice of Clinical Aromatherapy than the politics of the use of essential oils clinically. I'm already convinced that the use of essential oils can be helpful in the healing of ourselves and others. I found the books by Kurt Schnaubelt to be more useful.
3,Good book with a major distraction,"The book is full of information about a very interesting time in history. I didn't mind the jumping around that another reviewer mentioned, but I am COMPLETELY distracted by the author's need to change the names. If you can't handle ""Franz Joseph,"" you should try a little harder. Who is Archduke John? We are lucky he didn't change ""Maria Anna"" to Maryanne. Dear Author, please give your readers some credit."
2,Twilight of the Habsburgs,"I currently am reading this book, and find it very difficult. The author skips around from one idea to another and its all on the same page. I do not understand his thinking in transforming all the Austrian names into an English version. This loses the historic context of the story and country. Had I know this I probably would not have bought the book. At this point I do not know if I am reading about an Austrian Emperor or an English king since Franz has become Francis. The author did a great harm to the history in doing this. I do regret buying this book and will advise others against it. When you write about history you need to present all the facts, and he did not do this. The names are the first example, skipping around and glossing over events without exploring them deeper is another."
5,Great book!,"This book is a splendid description of Franz Josefs life. Every ascpect is covered good, and you realy feel that you get a picture of the man and the emperor. I strongly recommend it."
4,DOWNFALL IN WALZ TIME,a CLEAR SUMMARY OF THE MAIN EVENTS IN THE LIFE OF A MAN STRUGGLING TO HOLD HIS EMPIRE TOGETHER WHILE HAVING TO COPE WITH PERSONAL TRAGEDY.
5,Ghettos of the Mind Village,"Years ago as a FM-radio announcer at WHUS-FM, I introduced 'Bama to the people of New England & New York. This is a superb album. I got many requests to play different cuts. Two weeks ago while riding through Mystic,CT. one of the radio stations played it. I have been looking for this album and other Black poets on CD. I'm glad to know that this one is available."
5,SUPER,I HAVAN'T HEARD THIS CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. I WOULD LOVE DTO HERE IT AGAIN AS SOON AS POSABLE.WHERE CAN I GO TO HERE A SAMPLE OF THIS RECORDING.
1,Don't buy,"Seriously disappointed. It simply doesn't work well. I am giving it a #1 because I will use it for warming foods, the purchase price wasn't totally lost. If one puts on the cover, the bacon is steamed, if one takes off the cover the bacon requires paper towels to hold down splatters. I didn't have to buy this product to use paper towels, they already worked on my own plates."
3,Great for Bacon-Needs work for meat,"This works as advertised for bacon, and I am loving the convenience of it. However, though I can make it work for cooking ground turkey for turkey burgers, it could be a bit deeper to handle the extra grease, and with longer handles as I get slightly burned when taking it out of the microwave.Despite these shortcomings, it has replaced my T-Fal and George Foreman grills, which made quite a mess when cooking inside, and took a bit of work to clean.That reminds me of another shortcoming, this needs to come with a 'fork' that fits the grooves in order to make it easy to remove the burgers from the plate. Right now I am using my George Foreman grill fork to do this, and it does not work very well as it was designed for narrower grooves."
2,Is it really a grill?,My husband was disappointed in this product. What he was used towas being able to grill his hamburgers in the microwave. I was unable to find the grill we had before maybe it is not made anymore. This one did to him exactly what the George Foreman grill does which we have and that was not the texture he was looking for.
2,"Good for meat, not good for bacon","First of all, although this is touted as a bacon/meat grill for the microwave, it sure is not designed for bacon. You can barely fit two bacons on it without putting them crinkled up due to its round shape. Secondly, the amount of grease from microwaving bacon fills up the grills and overflows. Third, the plastice cover doesn't look anything like the picture, and is quite flimsy. It's okay for cooking a small bit of meat, that's about it."
2,Not quite what I had in mind!!,Was looking to replace 15 yr old microwave bacon rack - the trough on this one is nowhere near deep enough to hold the grease from the bacon. Probably will use for steaming vegetables instead!!!
4,What a Ride!,"""Roadside Florida: The Definitive Guide to the Kingdom of Kitsch"" by Peter Genovese is a real ride through the old highwayland of Florida. Rather than cashing in on all of the bigger attractions that most people have heard of, Peter gets in and really digs out some lesser heard of gems of true kitsch. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, the pictures are great, and I'm not going to get into context because I don't want to give any of it away."
5,Loved it.,"I've been a Mammoth enthusiast for a few years and thought I was pretty familiar with the scene, but there is really more to this area than I knew. We're winter sports enthusiasts, but now my husband and I are thinking of doing our summer family reunion up there. My three kids (ages 19 to 26) also ski and do trips to Mammoth on their own as well as with the family. They are all getting this book as a stocking stuffer for X-mas. We travel a lot and I rely on guidebooks all the time. As far as I can tell, this is the only Mammoth book out there. It has a kind of breezy style and is an insider's guide to a town I thought I knew well."
3,A Sour Look At Christianity,"I am usually a fan of Paul Johnson, but this early book by him left me cold. It is a fairly hostile look at the history of Christianity focusing on its failures rather than its successes. I assume it was written during a part of the author's life when he was more critical of institutional Christianity than he clearly is in his latest works. This being said the book is very well written and Mr. Johnson does not play fast and loose with the historical evidence. The book's sins are of omission rather than commission, leaving out much that is positive in the history of Christianity while placing on full display the negative."
5,"Sorry, definetly the best History of Christianity around","Of all the history of Christianity (or related books) I've read, which are not that much (maybe 20 or so), this is definitely the best of all. Paul Johnson has written (as always) an erudite History, not a flawless one, but if you want more ""before Christ"" history, you can always read his ""History of the Jews""; if you want a strictly unbiased history... well, I really don't now a less unbiased one than Johnson's.The book is dense, plagued with data, and has a writing style of the intellectual Johnson is. If you are not intimidated with all of this (not that you should), this is definitely ""the book for you"". I totally recommend it as a non-specialist-history of religion lover."
3,Not like Paul Johnson's later works,"I loved Paul Johnson's ""A history of the American People"", and thought this would be similar. It's not. Unlike his later works, this has almost no footnotes--which is maddening because he still makes flamboyant claims, and then there is no way to track down his source. Also, I found his section on Medieval Christianity a bit disappointing. It was the standard pop-cliches.I guess he became a better historian with time, which is a good thing. I think I will read his later works, but pass by the earlier stuff."
2,Major Flaw,"I was looking for an objective book on Christian history; I was however disappointed by this book in that it referred to the Prophet of Islam (Christianity's major rival), as a monophysite (a discrete branch of the Christian tradition); for me this destroyed this author's claim to objectivity; no matter how knowledgeable he is about Christian history, Christian history is a part of world history, and one cannot define the rest of the world's religions through Christian terms- at least not in a work that claims to be objective."
2,So ambitious it forgets the big picture,"The decline of Christianity! Right. There aren't too many Christians around anymore.Besides that obvious, astonishing oversight, I expected worse in regards to a biased perspective Crusades, and was appeased at the author's acknowledgement of the silmultaneous atrocities of Islam. While attempting Biblical higher criticism assumes massive arrogance on the part of the critic, Johnson remains as balanced as one could expect. But in the last analysis, Christianity is a lot more than a history, and claiming to be able to explain Christianity as a historical specimen assumes both monstrous egotism and unimaginable naivete."
4,"Complete, Non denominational","This book is not an easy read but neither is it covering an easy subject. It starts from the Immediate pre-Christian era and continues to the modern period. The author is better known for later works ""Modern Times"" and the ""The History of the American People"", both of which are remarkable for their inclusion of religious and cultural effects on historical effects. And that is probably the most remarkable thing here, that the Church is covered in it's effect on the culture and governments of the time. And the Church in turn is affected by the culture and leaders with which it is surronded."
2,treats Christianity as if it's a made-up religion,"This book has some valuable historical information, but it is extremely biased in the sense that it talks about Christianity as if it's a made-up religion, derived from the pagan religions of the Greeks and Romans. It completely ignores evidence of Christianity's authenticity. I hoped that this book would provide a unbiased account of the history of Christianity, but unfortunately it did not."
2,Too advanced for most readers,"I bought this book thinking it would be introductory level, sort of ""Christianity 101."" It's more like ""Christianity 301."" The author assumes the reader already has a substantial knowledge of the subject. The material is very dense---not an ""easy read"" by any means."
3,Entertaining but too opinionated,"To be entertaining sometimes you have to be provocative and simplistic and this book is rarely boring. To those who like their history to be balanced, however, this book will disappoint. In his History of America, Johnson tries to stir the pot with his lavish praise of Nixon and utter condemnation of Kennedy. Here, Johnson will again condemn a movement based on a couple of stupid if entertaining, letters written by some of the less intelligent adherents but rarely takes a serious, balanced look. I've always believed that to defeat an opposing argument you have to put it in the strongest possible form. Otherwise you are just preaching to the choir. However, to entertain you make the other view look foolish and poke fun. Johnson is an entertainer."
2,Cracked,A few were cracked upon opening the box. Should have been wrapped better. Not as thick as you would think they should be.
4,Works fine with Windows 2000,"Like a previous reviewer, I needed to e-mail the company to get drivers for XP/Win2000. They sent them the next day. My laptop still has 2000... software installed easily.I have to disagree with the reviewer who said this scanner isn't even mentioned on the company's website. At the bottom of http://www.antec-inc.com/support_faqDownload.html they tell you where to e-mail for Attache drivers.I've only used the scanner in OCR mode... not actually doing OCR, but scanning entry forms etc when I'm on the road. The quality is quite adequate... and the documents are marginally easier to read than when scanned with my Canon LiDE20.You do need to be a little attentive when feeding paper through the scanner. Be sure it's inserted all the way before clicking on Scan, and making sure it travels straight.Very happy I bought mine, and would do so again.Jane Fleming, MCSE"
4,A nice little Roadie,"I wasn't expecting great image quality at this price, but have been very pleasantly surprised.Have been using with Windows XP Pro without any problem at all. Tech support on Antec website e-mailed XP drivers on request.Paper transport needs a bit of hands on guidance with really small items and sure, USB interface would be nice. But this is a closout, so one should not be expecting state of the art.It's not for the desktop, but it fits very nicely into laptop case and is great for the road.Even with XP, it's a deal at this price if you don't mind making the effort to get the drivers. But it would probably be wise to get them before buying."
1,Poor Driver Support for XP,"The CD failed to install working drivers. I downloaded a set of drivers and it states everythinga being in working order...but unit doesn't work.It says it's not powered on, and the manual doesn't offer much info at all. Documentation is poor for any troubleshooting.There doesn't appear to be any support for this product from Antec any longer. Great price...but might not be a great choice.*bummed*If I could get it working I'd be happy...it's small, compact, just what I wanted in design."
3,cell phone batteries,I ordered cell phone batteries for a LG 4500 & 8300. The 8300 batteries were defective. The vendor was notified thru Amazon & has provided new batteries that operate normally
2,So-so Recording of a Great Composer,This recording does nothing for me. I expected Liszt's works to be more rewarding. The only saving grace is I paid so little for it.
2,6 VDC,"As one of the other reviewers said, it puts out 6 volts and not 3. If you need 3 volts, I'd advise to stay away from this one.I would return it, but I already chopped the wire a bit, so I'll find another use for it."
1,Adapter:,"This was not the adapter I thought it was, it did not fit my fan so I returned it for a refund."
2,adapter w/out plug,It's the right adapter but did not include right plug to connect to machine. You have to buy that seperately. Ended up going to Batteries Plus (Radio Shack didn't have the right thing)as adapters now have universal adapter cords and you need a kit with different sizes of connectors. I don't know if I missed that in the fine print but was disappointed that I had to buy something else to get my adapter to work. Just be aware and know what you need to order so everything works.
2,AC Adapter,"It does what it is supposed to do--provide power, with one drawback. When using, the power it supplies is not as ample as when using battery power."
1,No tip,No tip on the end. I wish I would've noticed. It's useless without the tip. Can't find a nice selection of tips either.
2,A waste of money,"The Golosa book series is worthless to anyone who wants to self-study because it gives no answers to the exercises. It is poorly organised and layed out complete with stupid drawings and useless exercises that can only be performed in a classroom setting. That is, if one can understand the poorly worded questions presented. And for $180 flamin' bucks for the two books I'd say that it is a complete rip-off especially when students are the least likely to be able to afford to throw their money away on this type of scholastic inflation. Their web-site is helpful however and I use it regularly. Get the New Penguin Russian Course it is way cheaper and way better. If your school requires this book Golosa as many do then I pity you."
4,Have some help,"My Russian professor has used this book in my university-level courses and I'd say overall, very good. Great visuals, vocabulary lists and the chapters, for the most part, fairly comprehensive on their particular topics. However, without guidance, sometimes I'd get lost on the grammar portions. Attempting to read these sections on my own proved difficult and confusing. This is mostly due to a lack of examples or adequate explanations, that's where this makes a good coursebook as opposed to a learn-at-home text. There are reference sections in the back but I'd say unless you have access to assistance, this may not be the right book to begin with."
3,DVD not included,"I have just started using the book and the student activities workbook and I think it is a pretty decent beginner book. Having said that, I do not recommend it for use outside the United States. The oral exercises are only available on line. This is great if you are in a place with free or cheap internet (like a university in the US) but not so great if you are in a former Soviet republic with expensive and slow internet access. I am not able to download from the website here either, so I am stuck paying to play the audio. I really wish I had known this in advance and would have purchased another book if I had known."
3,Meh,"I was expecting the full set that was needed for my class, sadly only the hard cover came with no work book and no sound CD."
2,"good company, subpar book","not the best learning aid I've had for a foriegn language, that much is certain. But the shipping was good, and a reasonable price."
1,Sometimes u get what u pay for,"After charging the batteries (aprox 5 hrs) they lost their charge (walkie talkie on standby)in 6 hrs. Charged 24 hrs, still last max 10 hrs. Other rechargeables I use last several days."
5,Different approach that works well,"The layout of this book is different, and it is very helpful the way it is done. On each two page spread there is one photograph that the author goes into details of what it looked like in real life, what he was thiniking about how the photo should come out, and what proceeducres he used to get there (what filters, what rules of composition, what lighting challenges, etc.). Then also on the same two page spread, another one or two photos supporting the same idea, and some additional information blurbs. It all works very well and does help one look and learn."
1,didn't work,I ordered this tape along with 5 others and by the time I got to watching it a month later I discovered it didn't work.
3,Customer Support,I agree that their customer support is a complete scam. It almos amounts to a deceptive trade pratice. They dont respond to emails which forces you to buy their support service.
1,Yuk,I eat alot of organic foods and health foods but this has to be one of the worst tasting food items I've tried. Maybe it taste better toasted but I was under the impression you could make sandwhiches with it. I like my them untoasted. Do you want to know what this tast like? It taste like soft sawdust. I'm not kidding you. I will try their other bread but this was aweful. Please consider changing the recipe. The bread breaks apart easily and has ruined what ever I've eated with it. Very bad tasing. I have to eat it though because I live in a rural place and have to wait till I'm out to reorder my foodstuff. I wish I had a toaster maybe it would taste different. I've made a few sadwiches with no bread because it taste better plain and even dipping it in dishes let's see I dipped it in beans still tasted aweful and diped it in some soups. It's definatly the bread. :)
1,Worst gluten-free bread I have tried,"The taste is bad, the texture is bad--the only way we could eat it was to crumble it up to make meat loaf."
2,Moldy bread,"The bread shipped quickly and arrived ahead of schedule but that did not keep the bread from being moldy. I received 6 loafs of this bread and 2 had to be thrown out because they were moldy. That aside, the bread is tasty when toasted with a topping (quite delicious with butter or frosting)."
1,Gross,"This bread looks like cardboard and tastes like it too! I guess I just miss my ""white"" bread but this stuff isn't really edible if you aren't used to eating this kind of stuff."
2,Not what I expected.,I was expecting a full length movie. This one didn't have much of a storyline as I expected. But it was ok.
5,Fascinating!,"This film realistically depicts so many lost pieces of history in a bittersweet story. Filmed in the late 1940's, and using local people as actors, it recalls the beginning of the oil industry, Louisiana's lost natural beauty and a lost way of life. It knits the past and present Louisiana together beautifully. There's also great footage discussing the making of the film. Anyone who loves Louisiana will love this documentary!"
4,Oil and Water,"There are loads of movies that should never have been made because they are copies of other movies. What's the point of watching them? You've already seen them. But this is a movie that's like no other that I've ever seen and that alone gives it four stars. If you've always yearned for a beautifully photographed black and white movie that will show you how to drill for oil in a wetland, how to catch an alligator, the value of having a frog live in your shirt, what a blow out looks like, and the benefits that the oil industry brings to the local community, (new coffee pot for family, new dress for wife and new rifle for boy,) then this is the movie for you."
4,Awesome..,"I have always been amazed by violin strings..The collection on this CD takes you to an entirely different world altogether..I would say, if you love clasical music, this CD should be on your ""MUST HAVE"" list.."
1,Ineffective,"I ordered this product to filter or arrest RF noise being generated by a treadmill and causing heavy static severely interfering all audio devices throughout my house. I bought two of these Ferrite Core Noise Suppressors so I could try several ways to stop the RF noise being generated. After trying every possible placement on the treadmill power line, nothing worked so I finally called the seller / vendor. Their technician said he's not surprised that they didn't work for this application. What a surprise, they're advertised as a ""Noise Suppressor"" to fix exactly the problem I bought them for. Shipping cost to me and back are too expensive to throw good money after bad."
3,Still....,"They were the first nederhopgroup ever. This is the eightest album of osdorp posse. I think it is a fine album and the productions are better than ever ( bu seda). It is still good but there are now better in the dutch. It is a good album but not great. 3,5 stars!"
1,Their worst...,"I'm from Belgium and I'm not a big ""nederhop"" fan but I heard 'bout ""Osdorp posse"" being the best rapgroup from Holland so I bought a couple of their CD's and there are a few wich I really like but this isn't one of them! I think this is the worst OP album to come out! All they rap about is how commercial music is these days though this CD is commercial itself! If you heard ""Origineel Amsterdams"" you understand what I'm talking 'bout! And the beats are BORING, there are maybe 3 or 4 songs on the whole album with a decent beat on it! The best songs are ""Rammen en Beuken"", ""Horen of voelen"" en ""Rust en Ruimte"" en those tracks are just PRETTY good, they aren't tha bomb or anything! And the so called free CD is a rip off 'cause you have to collect it at a concert but then I have to go all the way to Holland and that's not worth it, sorry OP! If you're into Dutch rap buy OP's ""Afslag Osdorp"" wich is their best album and will allways be their best..."
1,What is this???,"This is the latest cd of dutch hip hoppers Osdorp Posse , and by far the worst ever. The lyrics are so cliche , the beats repetetive and interludes unimaginative. Plus the single Origineel Amsterdams is really annoying yet catchy for a big audience. The production is way to polished , therefore the rawness of their best CD (Afslag Osdorp) is never reached. Also the so called ""free""(you must collect it at a concert) CD is really , really bad."
1,Don't be fooled by the hype!!,"This game is terrible. The graphics are average at best, and the control is second rate. The sound effects are not up to par with even the lowest rung of modern games. Physics in the game are goofy, and unrealistic; you ram a car using your turbo, and it just falls without the vaguest sense of realism even some sort of graphical effect. Or, you get hit by a drone, and you go flying through the air, with the same animation everytime. Even when fighting hand to hand, the combos are so generic and unimaginative. The character animations are weak and very repetitive. It's as if the creators have never made a game before. Yes, it's that bad. The story is uninspired, and told without conviction. The voice overs are a disappointment. After waiting so long for a decent Transformers game-20+ years!- is this the best Hasbro could do?"
5,"A Distant Shore, Lute by Ronn McFarlane, is classical Lute Music, performed by a Master.","A Distant Shore, Lute by Ronn McFarlane, is classical Lute Music, performed by a Master. I loved this CD, quality is perfect. Dorian recording Science is superlative. Track 11 is my favorite. I will never tire of this CD."
5,A Must Have if You Plan to Shoot with the DVX100,Noah knows this camera and the post-production workflow inside and out. Save yourself a lot of grief and lost time and get this BEFORE you start shooting. You'll be glad you did.
1,DO NOT BUY,I bought this video on VHS years ago but remember it being sooooooo bad that I had to write a review when I stumbled across the fact that it is still forsale. I honestly can't beleive that this video is still being sold...I remember being initally shocked to find that there is actually NO Tool music in the entire video. There is only cheap tool sounding knockoff music. All of the actual information presented(mostly just still pictures and voiceover) in the video can be found and read in a few minutes on Wikipedia...
4,Tool Biography,This was a purchase for my son-in-law. He loves Tool and really enjoyed the personal interviews and of course the music.
1,JUNK,"This is so bad I just want to do my part to make sure the ratings stay low. 2 minutes of one interview, 5 shots from a show.... Padded with bad stop motion and terrible music to fill 45 minutes. The interviews with thier buddies pretending to be someone are laughable... They even had Paul in his Master Lube uniform (or somesuch) as an expert on something or other... Total waste of money. It's tough to tell if these guys were merely trying to do the minimum to profit from the TOOL name or if they in fact were just too freakin' stoned to know any better."
1,Now that I have gazed upon this unholiness.....,"And with bowed-head I send thanx to the many wise TOOL fans represented here. I now post my thoughts on this abomination, this cursed misrepresentation, this...this blasphemous endeavor.The thanx are for all of you. All of you that urged the path of goodness and curbed my desire to exchange my hard-earned money for this...this vomit. I'm sure I spent it well elsewhere. However, a curious masochistic force eventually drove me to borrow this disc from a less fortunate fan and view it in its' wretched entirety. All is as described within the keen walls of these numerous reviews. Upon stomaching this...this toxic spill, no further coherent words regurgitated to add any more insult to injury. Suffice to say that if I could be Miles Kahn for a moment, I would seek out the deepest crevice of Hell to hide in.I quote Marcellus Wallace: ""if he goes to Indo-China I wan't a nigga hiding in a bowl of rice ready to pop a cap in his ass"""
1,I'de rather visit Dachau again than watch this tripe.,"Dachau, a concentration camp in Germany, was more entertaining than this DVD. I would honestly procreate with a running blender before I watch this dung heap. For all the reasons the other astute reviewers mentioned, I pray that a special punishment in hell is specifically held for the people who made this. If you by chance purchase this bucket of pus, may god have mercy on your soul."
1,Dumbtastic,"TOOLOGY is nothing more than a shameless attempt to capitalize on fan sentiment. The creator knew that TOOL fans would love to get their hands on footage of the band they love, and unfortunately so many bought into it, (I'm no exception to the case). The DVD is disgraceful, with ridiculous cut scenes in which the author tries (and fails) to imitate some of Adam Jones' artwork, a stupid voiceover done by some guy who sounds like he belongs at a Nascar event, and horrible boring music playing throughout. Save your money, and don't support self-interested, bland people."
1,No offense,"but if you're stupid enough to buy these ridiculous ""Unauthorized"" DVD's, then you deserve the discomfort of having shelled out hard-earned cash for nothing but interviews with fans and other worthless clips of anything BUT the band."
1,"What a piece ... ! Rate ""Negative 100 Stars !!)","This DVD is a complete waste of money. It doesn't even containmusic from the band. It's a poorly homemade, unauthorized pieceof garbage. The band TOOL is fantastic ..."
1,i just want to cry,there should be a law against this stuff...every unauthorized one of them. dont even bother wasting your time with this...unless you want to use it as a shooting target.
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I am not very impressed with this DVD most of the information covered is common knowledge and the majority of the footage is looped over and over again with different audio behind it, i dont believe at any point in this video i actually heard any of TOOL's music playing, im sure this is due to copyright, because i know how they are about that, cough* itunes *cough. The only part of this video that actually entertained me was the interview footage with adam jones. Would recommend renting if you could find somewhere to do that but deffinatly not worth buying in my opinion, i am a huge tool fan, have every album all the way back to opiate, i even have the spiral from lateralis with the third eye at the bottom tattooed on my forearm, if i cant find entertainment in this video i doubt many others will."
1,absolutely beyond horrid,pure shameful profiteering garbage. nothing at all the true tool fan would appreciate. do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK! im so pissed i wasted 14 bucks on this paperweight! id like to sock the maker! the negative opinions on this site are absolutely true. far beyond worthless....id give it zero stars if it would let me...
1,Don't bother!,"Normally I would not waste my time reviewing an item which I found such a malcontent for. However, I feel as though if I could inform one fan NOT to buy this DVD, then my time here was well spent.Every review I read concerning this shady documentary was absolutely true. In this case, allow yourself to take the word of others. Had I seen one minute of this waste of time, I would never had regretted not purchasing. Please, if you must spend the twenty bucks buy an album for somebody who has not yet heard Tool.This DVD is good for one thing and one thing only, target practice."
1,tool Bio,"When I saw this I was like cool!, I didn't buy it I read the reviews first. I'm laughing my ass off at all these reviews LOL"
4,Good for the videos not the Bio,When I bought this video I only wanted it for the high quality video's which are great. The bio stinks. I had no intrest in the biography part of the DVD at all so I am happy with my purchase.
1,Think Twice Before Buying!,If you absolutely want to see this...buy it used or something...but don't give your money to the producers of this video!This was POORLY put together. The imagery is very annoying.Interview segments are sometimes interesting but basically seem a bit dull.
1,Don't bother with this garbage,"If you are a fan of Tool, STAY AWAY from this DVD. It has NO music or concert footage. It mainly consists of interviews with Tool fans and narration about the band and its style. If you are a fan, then you already know what Tool is like! This DVD is USELESS.DON'T BUY THIS."
1,Don't Bother,"This DVD is a complete waste of money. It doesn't even containmusic from the band. It's a homemade, unauthorized pieceof garbage."
1,Ripping off the band,"Folks -- Don't even think about buying this. It is exctly what it says -- ""Unauthorized"". The dinks who produced this are doing nothing but ripping off the band by trying to commoditize the name ""TOOL"". If you are a fan of the band, do them a favor and do NOT buy this product."
1,The Greatest Insult To The Band I Love So Much,"Quite simply I would reccomend that someone purchase post-consumption food products instead of wasting a single dollar or minute on this UNAUTHORIZED (that is the key word to this product) DVD. The packaging states that the video includes never before seen footage, yet, they fail to mention that none of this footage is music or live performance from TOOL. The halfhearted interviews include people who I have never heard of - people who you have never heard of - there is no authority or propriety in this work. Please, please, if you at all respect, like, or love TOOL do not purchase this product"
1,This is WORTHLESS,"This video is a poor excuse for a high school film project, I'd rather listen to a palindrome for double the 48 minutes of crap they have on there than watch Toology. I returned it and bought a Britney Spears CD with the money, yes, it's THAT bad, do NOT buy this pathetic waste of film space, time, and money... I AM DISGUSTED WITH WHOEVER CREATED THIS, Trinity Entertainment no longer has my business."
3,Fantastic Read but partly fiction,"This book was a great read. I didn't want to put it down. Valentine really knows how to keep you in suspense. The only problem I had was that I doubted some of his research and he tended to go off on conspiracy theories. But then you have to remember Valentine was interviewed on Oct 17 2001 for a South African Muslim Radio show. This happened after the many tragic deaths due to Anthrax and after the Terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The interviewer ask Valentine if the CIA could responsible for sending Anthranx to American People. Valentine said ""CIA happens to be the prime suspect in all these incidences, and the CIA may have a very good reason for sending, and I don't know that it is doing it, but hypothetically speaking, it may well be that the CIA sent the Anthrax letters to the individuals in the US simply to perpetuate the hysteria in the US."" When I read that, much of ""TDY"" suddenly lost credibility. Other than that it reads ok."
4,Great Death Metal from Finland,"There's just something about these Finnish bands..., a sinister sense of melody, a dark, brooding atmosphere, a mythological intensity that separates them from comparable groups in other Northern European countries. This nice round-up of 3 of Adramelech's releases (the debut full-length plus 2 EPs) has all of these qualities in spades. The music also features innovative compositions (some might say ""technical"", but the gratuitous connotation of that term certainly does not apply here) and an aggressive, martial style. Though released in the latter half of the 90s, this material has the sound and vibe of earlier Death Metal. For me, that's a good thing. Folks into the likes of Amorphis' ""The Karelian Isthmus"" or the debut from Demigod will definitely appreciate this. I think that any metal fan who enjoys an older-style Death Metal sound with morbid melodies and mythic content will likely enjoy this very much."
5,Discover something new - that is 1000 years old!,I have read a few of these types of book that describe the wonders of the world...I have to say that James Duccard has nailed it! He has the best true wonders of the world in this book and goes into amazing historical detail and I learned so many interesting facts and anecdotes about these ancient wonders. Duccard is quickly rising to being one of my favourite authors.
2,Heads-up!,"So this is a TWO-PLUG headset! Has 2 3.5mm plugs (one for mic, one for speaker), which is exactly what you need if you're plugging into a computer. This is not what you need if you are plugging into a phone! If you're trying to find something to use with a phone that has a 3.5mm jack, look elsewhere or get an adapter."
2,It's tight on the head,"the sound is good, the mic is clear.the band is very tight, it squeezes on the head very tightly.my suggestion: use a hair dyer and warm it up some, and bend the headband out some, so its not so tight.I got a head ache afte an hour of wearing them."
1,PRODUCT HAS CHANGED. BUYER BEWARE! Hurts my head and ears in less than 20 minutes like crazy,"I have two of these, one old one and a new (Oct 2012) one. Don't be misguided by earlier reviews: The product has changed. It hurts my head like crazy:The ear part sticks out in an awkward way that seriously hurts my ears. The band/boom part is very stiff.I've tried to add foam but that does not help.I should have returned it, but now it's just sitting on my desk and soon it'll be resting in a landfill somewhere.I never write negative reviews, but needed to make people aware of this issue this time."
2,headset review,"Works ok - my mom is hard of hearing, and she says that the talking through the headset is loud enough, but it sounds garbled. Uncomfortable ear cover - cheap foam not enough."
4,Great Buy!,"This headset works great, for a landline phone connect,as a headset, and this price was fantastic and arrived quickly. Put the phone in your pocket, and do those dishes while holding for customer service. LOL"
1,Ordered two and only one worked,"I was very happy to find a headset with a 3.5MM plug. Of the two that I ordered, only one worked, however. Also, the one that does work does not have great output. People often say they can barely hear me and I end up taking it off. I have not yet contacted the seller about it so cannot comment on responsiveness."
3,Ok for the price,"Received the headphone they are OK for the price. They came in a plastic bag no packaging which gives the feel of a cheap headphones. After 10 minutes of wearing you get a pressure on the side of your head and your ear starts to overheat, since I do not plan on using it for prolong time I guess it is OK. If your planning to use for any prolonged amount of time buy a better headset it will definitely be worth the money"
2,Mono with stereo connectors..?,"I purchased two of these units in order to create a stereo interview with a mono voice on each of the two stereo tracks... unfortunately this ""MONO"" unit come with stereo plugs... makes no sense to me?"
5,Heated Passion!,"From the mystery of Castle of Wonders, to the carefree attitude of Avoi Dance, I enjoyed each song's creative images. Feel the serenity while taking Communion or listen to the fluttering Birds on a Wire. Get up and dance with the lumbering Giants' Dance, and put Fire Drake on the repeat mode and feel the heated passion!"
5,When My Name Was Keoko,"One family tring to keep their race alive. When Japan took over Korea, the Koreans had to speak, learn, and be just like the Japanese people. They couldn't even act like Koreans. This book I liked and disliked. The only part that I liked about this book is because I learned more about the Korean tradition. The part I disliked about the book was where the Japanese took over. Right then I started to get upset. Over all I liked this book because it kind of teaches you about the Korean past."
4,"Well-written, engaging, and accessible for young readers","I read this book with my daughter's book club (4th graders) and I think I enjoyed it even more than the kids did. Because it was written for young adults, the writing style is simple and accessible, but the story and, in particular, the history that is set forth in this book is certainly worth reading. Americans don't learn enough about other culture. This is a great opportunity to learn about WWII through the perspective of a young Korean girl, living in Japanese-occupied Korea. I highly recommend this book."
4,Innocent and touching,"This newest book by the VERY FIRST KOREAN NEWBERY WINNER is both innocent and touching. At first the split-narrative alternating between brother and sister put me off--and I do believe Park too neatly overlaps their entries instead of allowing a more natural rhythm--but the technique becomes quite effective once brother Tae-yul enlists in the army.As in her earlier books, Park's accurate incorporation of historical detail--such as the false announcement that ""Kitei Son"" of ""Japan"" had won a gold medal at the Olympics--is both stunning and stimulating. Few American readers will know of these details, and the tense dramatic unfolding of events will prompt many readers, both young and old, to go to their history books to learn more. A fine achievement which opens doors of discussion to these too-long-ignored issues."
3,Interesting history,"Linda Park is an enjoyable author, but I found this book disappointing. The book, The Year of Impossible Good-byes (referred to in the bibliography) is such a poignant, true account of the same time period for the same age group that this story seems watered down. It is still worth reading, but if you haven't read The Year of Impossible Good-byes, and this part of history interests you, make sure you read them both!"
2,Disappointed at packaging,"My product did in fact return on time, but the method of packaging was horrible! My books were in a bubble-wrap envelope, but it seems the packer didn't do a good job of putting the book in carefully- the corners of pages and even the cover is folded. I usually expect my Amazon books to be in pristine condition (especially since they're in new condition), but this time, I'm so disappointed."
2,When My Name was Keoko,"Maybe its because I only got to page 31 is the reason I did not like this book! I felt like this book was very drawn out and I wasn't getting into the thick of things as quickly as I wished. I do, however, love the summary of the book."
5,Awesome,This book was amazing and very educational. I recommend it to anyone who likes an interesting story. It tells of what it was like during the war.
2,Don't stack well ...,"These bins have tiny stacking legs, so they regularly fall into each other. Look elsewhere for something with better ""legs""."
2,Item Not as Large as it Seems,This item is not nearly as large as it seems in the photo. Carefully read the dimensions and picture the size. I was disappointed.
2,Great,"Be warned that this is not 14 bins, but one bin named ""BIN-14). I thought I was ordering 14 bins. Yes, it was me that misunderstood it's description. Nice size, pretty good quality plastic."
4,A Good History Book!,"This was a highly interesting book. The title,the Seven Sisters refers to the seven oil companies who dominate the world petroleum marker. This book gives a history of each of the seven sisters(such as Exxon and Shell). This book also tells of the shaping of the world of oil as we know it today. The Seven Sisters also tells of events that have occurred that have had bearing on the world of petroleum. All in all I found this to be a very in formative book that made for informative reading. You will not be dissapointed if you purchase it."
4,Power of the oil industry,"Although this is about the history of the oil industry, the only thing that has changed is the cartels that are now controlling the world vs the US companies of the past."
4,Good option for basic sound,Wanted an upgrade to the cheesy in-ceiling speakers that came with our house.These fit the bill. Decent sound and range at reasonable price as part of a basic surround sound system. Nice quality.
3,Corelli the old-fashioned way,"This is a simple, straightforward reading from the early seventies. It is played in the warm, soothing Baroque style typical of unreconstructed modern instrument performances of that time. That being said, it is not grotesquely romantic or heavy: a chamber-sized orchestra is employed, harpsichord is used in the continuo, and important cadences (but not ALL cadences) are trilled. It is not ignorant of Baroque performance practice, but not obsessive about it either. I prefer it, because it lacks the nervous jittery energy and abrasive tone of many period instrument performances. I give it three stars because this style may not appeal to everyone, and generally the reading is lacking in creativity. It is not a desert island disc by any means, just a nice plain Corelli recording that is easy to listen to and enjoy."
1,Never arrived,This book was ordered 19 february and it is not arrived until now (7 May). I need it for a thesis. A very bad service
3,Not the program I expected,"I agree with another reviewer - this is NOT the program I saw on the History channel about the Empire State Building. It is a shorter program that seems to have come from A&E. About half the program is taken up with background (e.g. crowded conditions in NYC, etc). It doesn't really have all that much info about the actual building of the ESB. I know I saw a much longer program on the History channel about building the ESB (I even think it was on the Modern Marvel series), but this isn't it."
2,Just be sure to keep your receipt,"Good: comes with all the cables you need to setup a switch for two systems to share a monitor, USB keyboard and USB mouse. Reasonably priced. Small size. Supposedly has hot switch capability.Bad: Recognized desktop, but wouldn't recognize laptop and wouldn't switch between systems. Basically my primary system would work as long as it was the first and only system I used. As soon as I hit the switch it was time to shut down and reboot both systems. I'm a well-above average user and I tried everything I could think of to make it work, read the directions from the start, booted up separately to allow initialization, checked the knowledge base website. After several frustrating hours I returned it."
3,Just okay,"It is smaller than I expected and the eyes are not visable unless you are on eye level, it's okay. Was bought for a 2 yo she will probably love it."
4,Hebrew for the Ears,"These two CD's serve as another helpful addition to Zondervan's ever growing original languages library. Pennington again is the ""author"" who lends his voice to the reading of the Hebrew words and their definitions. It basically follows the same format as his New Testament Greek Vocabulary.All Hebrews words occurring 20 times and more are given in their descending order of frequency. Pennington also says the alphabet in the beginning and like the NT counterpart there is a 40 page booklet to accompany the CDs. The glosses (definitions) follow Zondervan's Vocabulary Guide for Biblical Hebrew by Van Pelt and Pratico.The only disappointment which I have so far is that I learned Hebrew using the modern pronunciation whereas Pennington uses the Classical pronunciation. (...)"
5,looking forward to my next order of tea!,"My best friend got me a prince william and princess kate tin collectable, and this kind of tea was inside. I will tell you I love my black tea. When I had used every last one, I thought, I can't afford to buy new fancy tins. I took the label and searched amazon, and poof, all the ahmad tea I could want.. this product is yummy great black tea, good for any time of day. The big winner is amazon for having everything one could wish for. Where else can you type in a tea label and come up with. The exact product. I absolutely love this tea. And I am a hard sell. Try it, and enjoy!"
3,Not as good as Twinings or Dilmah.,"The box reads that Ahmad English Breakfast tea is ""a blend of Ceylon and other origin teas packed in Sri Lanka"".I've tried Twinings' and Dilmah's English breakfast teas. I would rank Twinings first, followed by Dilmah and then Ahmad.Twinings has the best flavor and comes closest to the classic taste.Dilmah is decent, but doesn't taste as full bodied as Twinings.I didn't like Ahmad. It tasted more like Dilmah's Ceylon tea than English Breakfast Tea."
4,Ahmad is the BEST brand,I love this brand and the English Breakfast tea is amazing however I like the 50 bags pack better than this one.
5,Awesome- the best makeup mirror,This is the second time I'm ordering this makeup mirror. I had the 1st one for almost 10 years and it was awesome.I love the combo with the smaller 7X mirror and the adjustable pedestal base is perfect. Plus the lighting is very good. I'm a makeup Diva and this is by far the BEST for everything from your basic work makeup to smokey eyes & eyelashes.
4,"Simple, stylish, affordable.","I replaced the drop handlebars on my 80s road bike with North Road style handlebars and wanted some cheap, simple grips that would be a good price balance between fancy Brooks leather grips and cheapo rubbery ones. I was initially worried about the durability of cork, but I couldn't ignore the price. The bike shop put them on for free when I had them change my bars and cables, and even though they did crack on the underside, they haven't budged at all since, so I don't anticipate the problem getting any bigger. They have darkened nicely with use and are comfortable to hold on a long ride. I commute to work everyday for about 6 miles round trip, so they work well for me. I can't attest to heavier usage, but the look is nice and classic."
2,Not so great,"These hand grips come looking quite nice in the packaging but in the end not so great. First of all the company is quite slow about processing things so don't try to expidte them as they take 4 days just to process your order and the only thing you are paying for is to shorten the actual time they are in the truck. The cork is neither as thick nor as cushioning as I had thought it would be. I had seen a set of these at the bike store for $10 more and loved the feel. Now I wish I had gotten the bike store ones. In addition, these are for large thick handle bars. I have standard Cruiser bike and my boyfriend has had to modify the product to get them to stay on. We anticipate it will be terrible to get them back off when we have to replace them in a year."
3,sport luxury seat covers,Very good looking seat covers. But I would not recommed. They are coming apart in the seams already. Probably the only thing I have purchased on-line that is disappointing.
3,Its a good product,This is a good product in making your hair soft and for breakage....There was people making reviews saying that this product make your hair itch...It make your scalp itch like crazy...i actually used another african pride product made my scalp itch...I dont know what they put in it but it itch your scalp real bad...I will not be buying no more of african best products...
2,Weak,I bought this DVD and was very disappointed. There is no live footage of the band just pictures. Everyone that's interviewed are just fans. I would wait until there OFFICIAL DVD comes out early next year.
3,Tartan Chillout CD,"A few fantastic songs, but most are average. Price was fair and service was good."
5,Great Sign,"Because I bought this as a gift, I haven't personally ""tested"" it by hanging it up, but it looks great!"
3,It is 'OK',"It does not cover the 'details,' but makes for a good classroom companion. I do not think this is the right book for anyone who has not been instructed how to 'properly' use a Jo. In some pictures the technique is weak, but the kata (forms) are laid out very well and are easy to follow. It is a good book and I do recommend it if you study Jo and are looking for more material or just like to have it in front of you. Or, If your one who studies Kenjutsu and have reached the Jo section of your program this would be a great aid. This book focuses on the defeat of Musashi and is a must for a true student of Ken."
3,~ EP + Full length ~,"I am not a huge fan of doing reviews when there's already a product description AND MP3s to sample. But, in short, here it is: I bought the Seed Of Hate EP at MoshPit Records in Colorado back in 1995 when it was originally released on Repulse Records. I still have it because it kicks so much arse (despite the fact that they sing [gurgle & growl] about dope). The 1st 4 tracks here (Seed Of Hate, The Way Of All Flesh, Devoted To Cannabis, Vomit Of Innocence) are from the great, guttural Seed Of Hate EP. 2 years later I figured I would get their full length follow-up called Void. What a letdown that was. Reincarnation went from extremely heavy, bass slapping, guttural death metal to - well... generic, boring death metal on Void. No worries though. After several years this has been re-released here as a 2-for-1 deal. So you can get them both for about 4 bucks including shipping. That's worth it for Seed Of Hate alone.- Jay in Texas"
3,Has its uses,"Not a bad product, but it could have been better. I like the visual candy a book offers, and i think it helps make the product more fun to read. With all the vaunted artwork WOTC has, this book has overall weak pictures with not a smidgen of color.Of course, all that aside, the content is fairly good. I particularly like the mind flayer assassin. There are groups of non-human parties that are somewhat strange, but i suppose they all fit the flavor of 3rd edition where weird is the norm.Not a mandatory book, and sort of on the thin side, but a resourceful DM can use it."
2,Enemies and Allies?,"I was excited at the prospect of getting this book but when I opened it, I was dissapointed by its contents. I was expecting rules and guidelines as to how to create balanced and proper NPCs but rather I saw a lot of missmatched classes, especially with the ""monster"" types like Mindflayer Assassin (huh?). In short, I was expecting a lot from this material, hoping this would help me create NPC's (enemies or allies) using sound guidelines but rather the entire booklet is just full of silly and ridiculous samples.If you're not feeling creative, then this might help you. But, if you need to make a perfect villain or ally in your campaign, then stick with your own imagination and it might save you a few bucks!"
4,Great reggae Album. (Try something different..! ),Great classic reggae beats with a brasilian twist.If you like good 'Ol down to earth reggae you should definitely check this out. All the lyrics are in Portugese.
5,Best jazz musician in years,I've been listening to jazz for 30 years and this guy instantly jumped into my top ten list. I pray he keeps producing music. There are a lot of influences here but he is also innovative. If smooth jazz doesn't cut it for you then get this.
2,Culture and Customs of Guatemala,"The main problem with this book is the quality of the pictures. They are black and white, and so dark that you can't even tell what's in the pictures. They're useless, and it's hard to understand why they included such horrible pictures in a book of this price. I was also under the impression that the book was aimed at ages 9-12, but it's definitely for teenagers and older. I additionally purchased the National Geographic book on Guatemala and would strongly recommend that one instead of Culture and Customs of Guatemala."
2,Defective,"I really like the design of the clock. The first clock came and it read ""Baby Tim"". I sent it back for a replacement. When the second clock arrived everything looked okay. When I put the battery in and tried to set the time the hour hand just flopped down. I am not going to try again. I requested a refund and am disapointed that this clock did not work out for our nursery."
4,good product overall,"Overall, its a good set of headphones. Ive owned quite a few sets of bt headphones and by far i still dont think any are better than the Moto HT 820 setThe jog dials are good and handy, and they are comfy on the ears. they already send you the case with them too so dont buy it optional. They wont tell you this when ordering hoping that you will pitch them more money...They are also a little on the large side. If you purchase you will get cracked on for looking like DJ Khaled( Just giving heads up. the ht 820's that moto makes are the best ive ever owned. above any.But for the money these a great fit ....enjoy"
5,Awesome!,I have tried 4 other blue tooth headsets and these are by far the best!The sound is great and the ergonomics are well laid out. I just got them and I already want a second spare pair.
3,Not bad for a bluetooth headset,"This is the first bluetooth set i own so i can't say for sure if this is the headset's fault or not but connection drops once every two minutes. This also is a big headset, that's not necessarily bad but something to keep in mind. Other than that the build quality is fine and it sits pretty comfortably on the head."
3,Eh.. Okay I guess..,"Over all I gave it 3 stars due to audio quality only, but would have given it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me. :) I'm sure there are those here who will say its a good mid-ranged headset, but as far as quality sound goes its about a 6.5 out of 10 for me. Everything else is great, and it works flawlessly to me. It just doesn't handle volume or bass too well, so it only gets so loud without distortion setting in. Because of that I would have thought it pricey, but it is well made, sturdy, and functions as it should (bluetooth). I have some 5yr old $20.00 DJ styled sony headphone that will blow the sound of these clear AWAY!! This device is good for travel, gym, eh.. maybe thats it. I wish my sony's were bluetooth enabled. :("
2,Not the best,"I got this headphones because of the cheaper price, and you get what you pay for. It does work, but sounds is noticeably worse than any wired headphones, controls are not very well designed, connection with my computer gets interrupted for no reason every so often."
5,First Class,"I bought this to go with my MP3 Player, so I can listen to music in hotel rooms when traveling without having to hear the AC units running, and I have to say it is amazing. I used it on Saturday when cutting the grass and it was great, does everything except pause/skip tracks. Turns out it is my BT transmitter causing the issues there. The headphones are well made, come in a very nice case which can store the charger and maybe even an MP3 too.For some reason mine was missing the 2.5-3.5mm cable, which is annoying as I was planning on using it on the plane. I've contacted the seller and I am sure they will take care of it for me.The best part of these headphones is they are super comfortable. I have worn them for about four hours outside in 90F weather and were not a bit of trouble. Well worth the money and more than five stars."
5,Headphones Rock,"Not knowing what to expect, I anticipated seeing how these headphones sounded. The sound quality is pretty decent, but better yet the volume great and has somewhat of noise canceling capability. I primarily use these for a five hour mow job, and both my phone and the headphones batteries' last the duration. Would definitely recommend for the reasonable price."
4,Lacks the cable,"Purchased these from Shopcell through Amazon. They did not include the audio cable as advertised in other sites. They did include the charger. After installing a IOGear microtransmitter in the USB of my laptop, the headset was recognized but did not play any audio. I found out through research that Microsoft XP was somewhat lacking in its support for USB audio. I had to go to the IOGear sight and download the Broadcom drivers for the Bluetooth transmitter. These drivers capture the audio from the PC and put it on the USB bus. After installing the Broadcom drivers, everything worked as advertised. I think that Vista has the necessary drivers but am not sure. Sound quality is not bad for the price. THe users manual is online at Motorola."
3,Sound quality wasnt great,"It is great having wireless head phones but the sound quality is not to great. The bass distorts sometimes and that really bugs me seeing as how they are""DJ"" headphones. Another down side was sometimes it would be hard to connect to my ipod or iphone. It would stop working and i would have to shut down the headphones, restart them and the blutooth on my ipod just to reconnect. That is very frustrating when i am on the subway and my music cuts out."
1,"terrible sound, spotty connection - 2005 produced item","A lot of static in the signal, combined with a thin sound, make these inexpensive headphones an absolute miss. Save up another $60 and step up to a nicer model."
3,Ok but not what I expected,I purchased these headphones with the intention of using them with my Iphone. They are not compatible. They work fine with my computer. The sound quality is also not so great. In all I guess they get the job done but I wish I would have done a but more research.
2,Worked great until it didn't.,"These headphones worked great for me -- I could play music, games, etc with my laptop or phone. Then after about a half dozen uses or so, they just stopped showing up on Bluetooth scans. I checked that they were charged up and pushed the button to make them discoverable, but no luck.Maybe I just got a bad unit, but this purchase was a disappointment for me. If these headphones had continued to work properly I'd recommend them, but as it is I just can't."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"Works great for music but should not use in car as it covers both ears. Very sturdy. My bride loves using it during her workouts and around the house.If you have someone that is hard to hear on the phone, this is the cure! Great value for the price!"
4,A real bargain,"These phones are really a bargain. They sound quite good - a bit hot in the treble area, but that's a plus for these ears that have lost a bit on top. The fit is snug but comfortable for my average size head. They might be a bit tight for someone requiring a large hat! They were easy to set up with my iphone. Pairing was easy. I noticed a few complaints in that area. The trick is to open the settings and have the bluetooth preference showing when you pair. Not as slick as some devices, but not that big a deal. While not audiophile, they sound a hell of a lot better than a couple of $100, in-ear units that I have. The only disappointment is that I couldn't get them working as plain vanilla wireless phones with my laptop. I succeeded in pairing them but was not able to hear audio from a CD or DVD. I'm not sure if they should work in that mode and the bare-bone instructions aren't much help. But for $35.00 it's pretty hard to fault them."
2,doesn't work with my Win7 system,"paired with two phones, no problem. but i bought them for my PC, and was an utter fail. paired with my system (which i put together myself less than a year ago, quadcore, 4Gb RAM etc etc...more than enough). the Win7 drivers loaded without problem. ok, great...but when i tried to use them, all i could get was choppy stutter. and when i walked away from my unit, not even 10 feet it was cut out. i have a bluetooth keyboard as well as mouse, and have no complaints with those. wish i could return them....should have done more research...my own fault, not amazon's."
4,memories,2nd opinion brought out the versatility of Marvin and Welsh as song writers and performers along with great vocals from Farrar. Much is the pity that the shadows overshadowed them. The Shads still sounded great in their 2003 final tour.
5,Excellent!,"The only paper to use with your Canon printer! I tried Kodak and HP with my Canon i960, but they were not nearly as good. With Photo Paper Plus, I get crisp, clear prints that are hard to distinguish from the photo lab. The Paper is thick and the size is perfect."
4,An excellent first novel,"I enjoyed this book immensely, and I'm a very picky reader. I usually stay away from books picturing angels with swords on the cover. I gave Campbell a chance only because the chain city was an idea I've never seen before. Scar Night is seriously lacking in backstory, but it's so well done that the sense of mystery kept me turning pages and now I plan to read the sequels.A word of warning: it does start out pretty slow. Both I and a friend I loaned the book to spent the first five chapters wondering ""where is this going? is it going anywhere?"" But when it picks up it really does pick up.In short: there are a few rough spots, but it's definitely good enough to justify the cover price. I'll expect more polish in subsequent books by this author, but for a first effort it's a pleasurable read."
4,Great debut dark fantasy novel,"Considering the dire state of speculative fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Campbell's debut novel after I picked it up at random in an airport bookstore. Scar Night clearly shares a lineage with the China Mieville school of ""New Weird"" fantasy but Campbell throws enough twists and turns into the plot and setting to keep the story fresh and interesting. The dark world he has created and the sheer density of the writing evokes the perfect mood, and I'd rank the city of Deepgate as the equal of fictional locations such as New Crobuzon or Gormenghast.As for characters, the cast is broad enough to sustain interest, although it took a while for the angel Dill to grow on me. I found Campbell's bleaker creations such as the poisoner Devon and the mad angel Carnival to be among his most interesting characters. I'm looking forward to the next installment, and finding out more about the world of the Deepgate."
3,Interesting concept,"There is a flame of greatness here but it's burried in an abyss quite like the one in the book, the abyss that Deepgate is suspended over. My biggest problem with the book is that I didn't really engage with the story, I think it may have been because I really didn't engage with the characters. Maybe that was because the story doesn't really dwell on one character but shares the time with several.The world unfolds before you in a complex game of power. Between the different powers in the city there are a lot of ways for the ordinary man on the street to die. However a series of deaths lead Dill, the last of his line, a battle Archon who can't wield his ancestor's swords and his guardian, Rachel, a member of the Spine, the police of this world.It's interesting and shows a lot of promise, and I shall be recommending it to a few friends, but it's just not me. It's more of a 3.5 than a 4 but once I got over the first 100 pages it started to really grip me."
3,Action Adventure,"This is a pretty good action adventure which I picked up mostly because the inside flap compares it to Steven Erikson. It's nothing like Steven Erikson, the world building doesn't compare to Erikson's depth. The world building is mostly secondary to dark atmosphere. This book is a wee bit slow getting started but when it does, it succeed pretty well. The charactors, as noted by other reviews, are very thin; and a couple of plot points had me scratching my head. For example, one charactor gives up a life time of belief and faith, pretty much cuz his boss tells him to. Doesn't really make sense for that charactor, but if you let go and enjoy the action, it's pretty fun - not unlike a video game. Clearly the work of a new writer, but with some imagination, and decent action."
3,What's not to like?,"A city held up by chains, death, mayhem, and the occasional bit of humor thrown in. What's not to like? The reason I gave this book three stars is that so much is glossed over - I keep wanting to know more about the characters. More backstory, more on what motivates them. Cuz, the characters do really interesting things that can only be appreciated fully if we can have some idea of WHY!!!!I understand that Mr. Campbell is making this as a trilogy. I can only hope that we find out more in the next book, cuz otherwise I will have to use my imagination, which is obviously less well engaged than the author's! No reason to give away story, plot, etc... I recommend this book for high school and over readers (some graphical content might be a bit much for the kiddies!) and let's move on to book two!All the best,Jay"
3,i kind of liked it,"It was a little hard to understand at first, but once i got into it i was able to go back and reread the chapters that were a little confusing, especially the opening sequence of events."
3,"Purchased, old library book....","It would have been nice if the seller had said it was an old, discarded library book. The book itself is OK, but I was disappointed to find out that the person selling it didn't disclose the fact that it was a discarded library book. I don't know why, but that bothers me."
1,"Constant Problems, terrible experience","The USR8200 looks promising on paper but my experience was terrible. At first, it was extremely unstable and I had many contacts with customer support, many levels of it, and cost me too much time. Some early problems were partially solved by new firmware, but never completely. At the end it failed completely and the customer support (support?) said LITERALLY to please throw it away. I did throw it away as I did throw away any respect for USR and its products. Extremely disappointed.So, my opinion is, if you want a stable reliable router look elsewhere. This is a piece of junk."
3,Ok but political correctness makes it worse than it should have been.,"Sister Wendy's American collection box set is an interesting survey of art collected in six American museums.About two thirds of the works surveyed merit the time dedicated to them.Her comments on art and specific works in general are MOSTLY informative and insightful but the format is marred by her use of ""WE"" and US"" in describing HER feelings on specific works. Also, can we ever find a documentary that is not catered to hide a politically correct message behind it? I want to learn and understand art history not be given a feminist lecture."
1,Chattering Boredom,"I bought this ""American Collection"" based on the European series which aired on PBS. The European experience I enjoyed, but this American jaunt was a journey to Tedium. This is a travelogue about cities and museums with some art tossed in to justify to whole production. Sister Wendy chatters endlessly about her opinions, her living quarters, and more items than I wanted or cared to hear about. The whole project is too ambitious for the time frame of six hours. For example, Vermeer painted only 34 paintings that exist today. One museum visted has 5 hanging. Wow! A chance to view 5 of the 34, but Sister Wendy blew buy the first 4, and went on endlessly about the 5th one. The time would have been better spent by viewing each for a few moments, whereby I could have done a freeze frame. Save your money."
2,Descent value but this item is bulky.,I have another allen pouch that doesn't have the bulky strap like this one and much prefer that older one. Would not buy another one of this style though.
4,"works well and it quiet, sturdy","By Marjorie's husband: Seems like so many ammo holders use velcro and that can be too noisy, and wears out. The plastic buckle is more sturdy and quiet. I like to carry plenty of ammo and this works well - price was great too."
2,better ones out there,It's cheap and is fairly compact but will still accomodate a host of magnum rounds including .338 WinMag though the fit is quite snug. My main complaint though is that the pouch is very uncomfortable next to one of my leather one's and that it's single fastening point really doesn't hold the pouch securely and neatly closed. It will do the job of course and I must say that the snap open/closed belt straps make it's removal convenient as well as making it easy to attach to most fanny packs or backpacks externally.
4,Red Rubber Boot Day,A wonderful treat as it traces a small boys rainy day activities from inside to out. The art in this book is outstanding with swirling blues and sharp reds and yellows. It is imagination food for child and adult alike.
2,NOTHING NEW,"This book brings very little to the table. If you know just the basic history of the mob, then what you find in this one will bore you."
2,Get your facts straight,"I just finished reading, Born to the Mob : The True-Life Story of the Only Man to Work for All Five of New York's Mafia Families. I have to admit I have an interest in this subject that sometimes causes me to make bad choices with regards to book purchases. This was one of those times. I should have known when I saw that it was only available in paperback edition. The author may or may not be who he says he is, but I'm 100% certain that he didn't have his facts straight. I mean at one point in the book he states that John Gotti was Paul Castalonos underboss, please... Another mis-statement was concerning the much storied assassination of Carmine Galante. If you can't get simple facts such as the aforementioned straight it's hard to lend believability to some of the other revelations in the book. I doubt this guy is who he says he is or did the things he has written about. I feel like a sucker for buying the book. I recommend that you not make the same mistake"
3,Worth the time,"Readers interested in this genre should give this book a read. - Rita Schiano, author ""Painting The Invisible Man""Painting the Invisible Man"
1,A Major Buffett Of B.S.,"This dude sold the publisher a bill of goods and recieved a nice payday for it. A scammer he sure is.Regarding Benny ""Lefty Guns Ruggerio"" his facts are totally wrongHe states Benny needed 50,000 to getout from under gambling debt to be made...well my friend...benny was a made guy long before his gaming debts! this guy is a real mutt! He worked for every family in New York ? yeah ok.......A free agent? yeah ok.....Seems like the public is crying for any OC material...this dudefilled the void...."
1,The poor tree that died to become paper for this garbage!,"Another dude trying to cash in on Americas fascination with Org. crime. He may have been some sort of fringe player in the world, but his story is not worth telling. Most of the book is info about all the stuff we OC fans already know. HIS actual story is short, and not all that interesting. Many grammatical errors. Very boring, and drawn out. A whole chapter on his freakin wife's baby delivery. Come on dude, I don't even care about MY wife's delivery."
3,Born to the Mob,"Taking into consideration the fact that every time I read a true crime story I try to separate the fact from the bullshit as let's face it the protagonist is usually a dog who is able to tell his story because he has turned rat and has turned in all of his friends and sometimes his family. Frank Saggio is no different; he turned dog and ratted on everyone all because he thought someone was trying to kill him. When the heat got turned his way he shit himself and broke the code he was bought up to live by, that generations of his family lived by.That is the reason why he is able to write his book. In all fairness the book is an easy and relatively entertaining read. Although there doesn't seem to be much substance to it or details. For someone who claims he was the mobs best earner (aren't they all?) he didn't seem to do much.It is a relatively easy and entertaining read, although it didn't really live up to the hype. There are better mob books out there."
4,Good Communication Research Methods Textbook,"This was the required text for my Communication Research Methods class, so buying it wasn't really an option.After flipping through the book to see what I was in for this semester, I found the layout of the book to be pretty organized.1.) Each chapter has an abstract at the beginning and a summary at the end that gives a brief overview of the chapter.2.) Each chapter has an outline at the beginning to show you how the chapter lays out the topic.3.) Vocab words are bolded, which is great if you have to know them for a test, and a list of ""Key Terms"" is at the end of each chapter.4.) Throughout the chapter, the authors provide examples of warrants and claims to illustrate the points they're trying to make.5.) Appendix A - A good guide to writing research reports and essays. Definitely helpful with assignments.Overall, I think that this is a pretty good textbook. The reading tends to be pretty dry, but not completely untolerable."
2,Not the worst.,"You know those textbooks that banter, point you to other chapters rather than explain the concept, are incredibly redundant, and lack any sense or clarity or conciseness?That's Merrigan and Huston's Communication Research Methods.I wish I could say better as I really appreciate the course although the text is very specific to one form of communication studies within its examples, it loses track of ideas when explaining an concept such as, ""there are three types of applied research..."" and only addresses two as if it had never mentioned three exist in the first place.As a previous reviewer mentioned the overall organization is definitely there as ideas are separated into their own sections and vocabulary is set in boldface to notify the reader of important material. If these aspects were not there the text would be unbearable. Maybe some improvements in a new edition?"
4,Pleased,"Received the book in a timely manner, and it is in like new condition. Will recommend this seller to others."
1,Dry and Boring,"I know communications research is not the most interesting topic in the world however, I feel that this book did not help either. The book is very dry but, I will say that it will give the information that you need about communication research.There are no pictures in this book only diagrams and graphs. They help to show you the theories and research methods put to use. Without them I would have been very confused about how to actually put results into an actual diagram which was an assignment that we did get assigned.This book may not be the most interesting but it will get the job done."
5,An excellent collection of inspiring stories,"Way, WAY before there was such a thing as Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul, Grace Livingston Hill was writing stories about people who find that trusting in God works! This is my favorite collection of her short stories, in that it is geared mainly towards young people. Through a variety of plots, the stories are a reminder to stop the hustle and bustle of life and look up. A girl discovers God's ability to transform even the mundane things in life, while a young man comes face to face with God listening to Handel's Messiah. I fully recommend this book to anyone who needs to be refreshed, or even just entertained a little."
3,OK I guess,"Been on the car for about 6 months and are ready for replacement. Not really any better than ""normal"" rubber wipers in my opinion."
4,High motivation and Detail,"This is a very exciting video about the origin, history, developments, success and failures of the Internet. It has good detail in the topics and companies that refers, but it does not touch every important(historical level) company in the net. Perhaps less time for ""excite"" and jokes, and more time to relevant companies and phenomena."
4,Stunning...,"OK I admit it, I love this song. This was my introduction to Damien Rice and I have to say, I'm impressed! This song is rough, dirty, visual and a touch primal - nothing short of brilliant."
2,This includes only ONE earbud.,"The design is nice and it's comfortable to wear, however, make sure you notice that it's only one earbud. This definitely wouldn't be the ideal thing for your iPod or to cancel noise. I'm dissapointed that this wasn't clearly marked, and now I have to keep searching for a good pair of earbuds."
3,GREAT LEARNING TOY WITH MANUFACTURER DEFECT,"YOUR CHILD WILL ABSOLUTELY LEARN A LOT FROM THIS TOY & LOVE IT DEARLY. UNFORTUNATELY THE ON/OFF BUTTON ON THE TOYS FOOT STOPS ACTIVATING THE TOY & THE TOY BECOMES INOPPERABLE. THE FIRST ONE I PURCHASED IN JANUARY 2005; IT LASTED UNTIL FEBURARY 2005 (ABOUT A MONTH & A-HALF.) THE SECOND ONE I PURCHASED MID FEBURARY 2005 LASTED ONLY 3 WEEKS, THEN THE SAME ON/OFF BUTTON MALFUNCTION OCCURRED. THE THIRD ONE I PURCHASED MARCH 2005 IS CURRENTLY STILL WORKING. IF THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURS, I WILL NOT BUY THIS TOY A FOURTH TIME; IT IS BECOMMING TOO COSTLY."
3,"Love it, but it has problems.","My son loves this toy but every time we turn it on it says ""time to change your batteries!"". I have changed the batteries several times and finally discovered that the battery compartment was corroded. After cleaning it out it seemed to work fine but realized that the triangle button doesn't work and never has - which frustrates my two year old. Since he loves it so much I'm buying him a new one. Hope this one works better!"
1,O boy...,the idea for this toy is great but like someone said the wiring is very fragile... i must admit i bought this toy three years ago but today i had to update the information tht was stored... wen i took out the recorder the insulation was basically dry rottened... now its junk because the recorder does not work... and the on/off button started malfuntioning i just thought it needed batteries but... nope...
3,"So Wonderful, But the Wiring Is SO Fragile","My son loves his Leap, and we've gone through 2 of them in less than 6 months. Leap goes to bed with my son each night, and he is very gentle with him. The problem is that the wiring that goes from his body out to his arm and leg buttons separates even with normal use. My husband was able to kind of hotwire him for a while, but then we broke down and bought a new one. Two weeks into it, the same thing has happened again... And now the original Leap's buttons on the sides of the alphabet tummy and on the hands only work on one side...It's really a great learning toy, and so much fun for my son as he drifts off to sleep. It's just such a disappointment to know that the wiring issues weren't a fluke."
2,doesn't last,"We have been through 2 dolls, just had to buy a 3rd. Kids don't know that when Leap has to take a vacation it means he broke again and I have to buy a new one. Kids love him and become very attached. Just hope the 3rd one lasts at least a year until my yougest child isn't so attached to him at bedtime that I have to search the web to find one. Don't think they make them anymore. Must be a reason. Not good quality!"
5,Something Corporate- Live at Ventura Theater,"I've been a fan of Something Corporate for quite a while. I recently bought this DVD and was blown away. It starts out with the boys getting ready. Andrew gets his haircut. Clutch (or Cluth as written on the bowling ball) bowls his best game. Josh goes shopping. And lastly, Brian goes on a search for drumsticks because ironically, he forgot his. The concert section of this DVD is Amazing. The play about 17 songs from Leaving through the window, North, and Ready...Break all of which are sounding fantastic. Nothing can beat watching Konstantine performed live. The one critism about this DVD is that they don't play my favourite song, Straw Dog. If you're not already in love with Something Corporate, you will be after you watch this DVD."
5,Kick Ass,"I LOVE Something Corporate. Their songs are catchy, fun, and awesome to rock too. I've been to 2 of their shows and this CD ROCKS cause it's just like being at a show. The bonus feature is hilarious, the show has tons of songs, and the crowd's favorite Konstanine is amazing. DON'T THINK TWICE JUST GET IT!!! You will enjoy :)"
5,Terrific concert video,"Great energy, wonderful music, good production quality. I wish I could have seen this band live, looks as fun as the Kinks!"
5,YES YES YES YES YES!!!,"Okay, I live in Colorado and I didn't make the trip out to CA for this show, but I've seen Something Corporate every single time they've played this state and their live show is amazing! There is no way this DVD won't absolutely bring the house down!!From the bonus clips (featuring Aaron of RBF no-less!) to the concert performance, this DVD is sure to be great. I've seen segments on line, and I cannot wait to be able to see these guys perform Konstantine live whenever I want!!What an amazingly gifted and talented young band!! For further news on what I think of SoCo read my Ocean's Avenue review. These guys rule!!"
5,concert in your house ...,"you wanna know how much i love this band ... i got the dvd before it came out as a promo and not only that, when it finally was released yesterday, i bought another one! so i have 2 copies, one for my room tv and the other one for the living room/family room tv!! isnt that great!the dvd is awesome! not what i expected ... it was way better! the concert, itself, was hella good! i wish i was there to experience the whole thrill ... it looked like the audience had a terrfic time!i tried to get tickets to see them yesterday at my city in the House of Blues, but i couldnt! SOLD OUT! man, that really sucked! but whats second best ... the music dvd! at least i get to watch them any time i want!! wo0oho0o!"
5,No Liam Gallagher Call,This is a superb CD but where the hell is Liam Gallagher on any of the songs.Liam would have sounded perfect for the B-side Full On which captures some of the brilliance of Definatly Maybes rock 'n' Roll sound. Its not much point putting Oasis on the cover as Noels the only one that features on it.He should have released this as a Noel Gallagher recording.Anyway the highlight of these three epic tracks is Carry Us All which is quite beutiful and should have appeared on SOTSOG
4,Best track from the album but not the best b-sides yet,"""Sunday Morning Call"" is most likely the best track on the new album. From the start of the song you already know its a song and has that acoustic-paul-wellar-ballad feel but now it has a full force sound. It hits you hard wanting more and ""Carry Us All"" creeps up. Another Noel Gallagher ballad which almost sounds like an echo of ""Where did it all go wrong?"" giving us that if we all work together it will be ok feeling. Too bad the gallaghers didn't look to their own lyrics fore advice. Sadly though the single falls at ""Full On"" which even for the new material is too far off and leaves the single on a bad note instead of uplifting. ""Go Let It"" however remains the best b-sides from ""Standing on The Shoulder Of Giants""."
2,earl grey?,"it has bergamot ""flavoring"" , not bergamot natural oil like in bigelow earl grey. and it taste and smell like regular tea. the tea maybe good, but not what i was looking forward to."
3,Not as Nice as Expected,Since these were Jiffy Lite I had anticipated them being as good as the Bubble-Lite that are Much More Sturdy and Stiff keeping things protected better. They worked fine but I thought the paper was on the thin side and there was no stiffness to the envelope.
4,"Rare document of raw, strong live performance.","This may be an uncommon view, but I regard this album as one of their strongest. The sound quality is actually quite satisfying and the trio gives a strong performance that tops e.g. the mediocre ""Burial"" live material by far (not to mention the numerous horrendous bootlegs). ""Knives"" (aka ""Till the living flesh is burned"") and ""In the night time"" sound even more intense than the studio versions. Raw, sometimes ""Joy Division""esque post punk that rivals anything of that period. Probably only DIJ's notorious imagery prevented them from becoming more popular at the time. Band member Patrick O'Kill makes a cryptic comment on the subject on the back side of the vinyl version of this album. Interesting fact that O'Kill released it on his own label EYAS. His former colleagues Wakeford/Pearce didn't approve. Anyway, get this one if you can!"
3,Wonderful tracks marred by low quality recording,"This release, recorded live at an early show, highlights what is arguably DiJ's strongest lineup (Pearce, Wakeford, and Leagas-- don't think Butler had joined by this point) and contains a wondrous array of old tracks, some of which only survive in print on this recording as of Dec. 2000. Unfortunately, though, whoever did the actual recording bunged the job pretty badly, and while it's not as awful as Day of the Dawn or the infamous The Guilty Have No Paste, it's still pretty ugly in places. But if you ilke Death in June, it's still an essential recording."
3,testament of the early days,"the early days of death in june are here. post punk at its best and some influences by joy division here and there. but theres no imitation at all, theres not just another band taking some others flags. no. its death in june but maybe you will be atonished and confused hearing it becouse they seem so far away from its future releases, quite different and raw,more percussive work, dramatic tension well captured in the recording.i think the sound mixing its not the best but certainly its an interesting album. this album is a testament of its epoch and the initial axis of death in june certainly the seed of all its future works. a must for a collectionist."
5,The best CD,no problem received on time for I will definetly order again from this vendor the item came right on time I will order again for Christmas gift. I love this CD
4,Fan Since Kirk Franklin and The Family,"I have been waiting for her to come out with a CD since the Madea plays. I was so pleased with this CD. She can definitely bring it. Speak Lord, hallelujah, and Trust Him are wonderful. The only one I do not like is Gotta Keep Movin."
4,"A vivid, if peculiar tale.","'Explorers of the New Century' seems to be an allegory for a variety of society's mores. Amongst them - chauvinism,racism,and the collective stupidity of blind adherence to regulations. Like Mill's previous book 'The Restraint of Beasts', the story is compelling reading even though there's no obvious direction (he presents a deliberately vague overall picture, while the simple details of day to day life are rendered with humor and crisp detail). Both books are very simply written, which is part of their charm. The cliche ""Less is more"" fits and works in these instances."
2,Save Your Pennies,"I'm a big Mills fan and loved Restraint of Beasts and Orient Express. This one was tedious and labored. It is parody of classic polar expedition books, but the real books are marvelous and describe real events. Their characters were more interesting and quirky than any of Mills fictional characters in this book and so it seems pointless to attempt to parody them. The whole book comes down to a one line joke and as I finished the book I felt like the office boor had cornered me and recanted an endless story at the office party. I was just glad when it ended. However, I remain a devoted Mills fan and look forward optimistically to any new works."
5,Tour de Force,"This is my first exposure to Magnus Mills, and I'm impressed. Taut diaologue and evocative descriptions bring you into the world of the explorers. Yet, the author puts their arduous journeys in a larger context -- and leaves the reader to ponder important lessons about man's humanity.The book veers into the world of magical realism, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Except that Mills does it in a spare way, instead of the lush world (and vocabulary) of Marquez. And it's just as effective.This is a truly memorable book. It will stay with me for a long time."
5,A must-have book for anyone interested in basketry,"Billie Ruth Sudduth's book is a masterpiece. The color photographs (and the baskets themselves) are amazing. She showcases some marvelous pieces made with both traditional and unusual materials. She explains every aspect of the craft remarkably well, in easy to understand fashion.Even a beginner could weave a basket using her instructions. I was pleasantly surprised that she included so many of her basket patterns for baskets that are on display at the Smithsonian. Now, I will be able to weave a piece of art with her easy instructions."
5,Pretty Color/Perfect Shade! The Best Bronzer on the Market!,"This is a great product from L'Oreal, Love it! Sublime Bronze Dual Action Instant Bronzer & Self - Tanning Lotion for the Face.This is a super great bronzer that adds a natural pretty color for my face. I use it daily in the morning, just a very small amount is needed. Does not clog my pores and contains vitamin E for smoother skin. Turns to a natural looking tan that is the perfect shade! I have found this product very hard to find available for sale in the retail stores, and online for that mattter. Some sellers on Amazon are asking 50 dollars and MORE for is product. That is not a very fair price. A more realistic price is under 25 dollars which I was able to purchase it for. I would highly recommend trying this product!"
3,Great gift item,"Bought it as a gift, so I don't know how it works, but I haven't been sued by the recipient, so I guess it's O.K."
5,Good cuppa tea,I love Ahmad tea. The Earl Grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping. The bergamot flavour isn't overpowering like some other brands I have tried.I will be buying more of this wonderful tea
3,Keep looking...,"...unless you are only buying this CD for Scheherazade. The orchestra never hits the right buttons with Cappricio Espagnol, and sounds rather plodding throughout. The opening of the Russian Easter Overture is difficult enough since there is nothing going on but unison, and if it isn't done right, it can sound rather high-schoolish, as it does here. The reading of Scheherazade, however, is decent and worth a listen."
4,Rimsky Whimsey,"The violin solo's are hear breakingly beautiful. Listening with your eyes closed, you can envision the supporting story. Beautiful. Price from this supplier was fantastic and delivery was reasonable. I'd buy from them again."
5,This stuff really works!,"We have a lab with a very sensitive stomach. Once his digestive track gets out of balance it could take 3-4 weeks, sometimes even longer, to get him back to normal. We have used Flagyl from the vet with varying results. Also tried probiotic powder (also from the vet) and that made him vomit. Then another vet gave us some Fast Balance. WOW. Depending upon the severity of the bout our pup is having (if he managed to eat something off the ground we didn't see, for example) this stuff fully gets him back to normal within 1-2 days maximum.It's like every product in that it might work better for some dogs than others. For us, it's a lifesaver. It's natural and I feel a lot better giving him this than a prescription drug. We really like this product and highly recommend it!"
4,Fast Balance for Dogs,My neighbor uses this product and loves it. When dogs get a tummy upset she puts some of this in their food and it clears up right away so I decided to get some to have on hand. I haven't had to use it yet but I am sure it will do the trick when I do. A very good product and it came within the allotted time. Would order again!
3,It's probally good but did not help,This product has great reviews so I tried it. It not work but that could be the dog or because the dog was on a medication that was having the side effect. I actually think this product is good and would reorder it. My issue it is very hard to give. I wish it was a tablet form. Got go dog barking.
5,Works nearly all the time for elderly dog.,My dog has had some health issues. A symptom is loose stools -- very loose stools. This product works pretty nearly all the time. I would definitely recommend it to others as something to try.
3,Not Alice at her best,"I admit, I was dissapointed with this book. After reading some of Naylor's other Alice books, I found that this dulled in comparison. It is mildly humorous and interesting, but for some real laughs read Alice in Lace or Alice in April. However, if you are planning to read the Alice series, you should not skip this one. It is vital to read every Alice book to understand some of the later ones."
3,You just MUST have a boyfriend when you enter Junior High!,"Or do you? Although all the girls seem to get a boyfriend, in the end, they all lose their boyfriends. One by one, first Elizabeth, then Pamela, and of course Alice. Alice gave up Patrick, partly because of her friends but also because of how much she worried about herself. It makes no sense on how much you have to think about yourself because of other person. Even though it was heartbreaking, it's amazing how Alice and Patrick are still friends."
5,Romantic,I liked this book because it was very romantic and fun. You should read it if you like fun and romantic.
5,Alice Still Relevant Today,"I loved this when I first read this way back when I was younger than Alice's 12 years of age and I love it now. This is a fantastic book dealing with a lot of the inevitable changes that come with growing up, mainly the changing relationship between girls and boys. I love that Alice stays true to herself and realizes that she is not ready for a boyfriend. Too many kids are growing up way too fast and her example is greatly needed."
5,"My favorite ""Alice""","It's one of the early Alice works (actually the second), but it's my favorite. Phyllis Naylor catches all the joys and pitfalls of being twelve and in the middle of a romance she doesn't know how to go farther with. Alice puzzles over such things as what to talk about when you're on the phone with a boy, whether you should kiss outside on the porch or not at all, and whether or not you should get your boyfriend a birthday present that you think he would enjoy: who knows if he has that record or book anyway?I'm only thirteen - a year older than Alice in this novel - but I found through its frank discussions it answers a lot of the questions I had. It's an Alice book not to go unnoticed. That's for sure."
2,Over compressed ?.,"This must be the worst quality C.D/vinyl I have ever purchased by the ventures.For acoustic instrumentation you need a large dynamic range with full harmonic range.This recording has either been recorded on a digital recorder or has been over compressed.It lacks harmonic range and sounds absolutely flat.Richard Ballard (Engineer,acoustics & audio) London England."
1,Will Not protect against light accidents,"This item is very thin, and poor quality, it may protect against scratches but that's about it. It's paper thin and can in no way protect against light accidents as advertised."
3,These are the masters!,"I want to make a clarification with Dwight Frye's review (great name by the way :)). These are in fact the recording masters for the original albums. Dwight Frye maintains that Polydor Records owns the masters and questions the authenticity of this being ""original recordings remastered"". As proof, he points out that this newly remastered recording was released by Casablanca Records. In fact, Casablanca Records is a off-spin of Polydor, and was the original label for Angel. This is a pretty good record -- Angel was a modestly successful 1970's band -- kind of a hybrid between Kiss and Queen. For the most part, they opened for a lot of bigger acts in the late 1970's -- I saw them at least three times in that era. Their stage show was great! The music was good, but really didn't stand out from some of the other moderate successes from that time period."
3,Progressive rock from the 1970s,"These are the first two Angel albums on remastered CDs. Angel was a progressive band that was active in 1974-80, with a style that could be described as a blend of Styx and Uriah Heep. The keyboard work, which features extensive use of mellotron and synthesizer, is impressive by any standard. The vocals are in the upper range, while the lyrics have something of a swords-and-sorcery flavor. The best tracks here are the two progressive epics, Tower from the first album, and Fortune from the second. The remaining songs are listenable, but not outstanding. The main drawback on this edition is the poor mastering, which is surprising since BGO Records usually does a good job with the sound. The highs, primarily the vocals and keyboards, are very harsh. The lows, primarily the guitars and bass, are a bit muddy. Some of this of course could have been caused by excessive use of reverb in the original recordings."
3,Get the original Mercury for these CDs,"These remasters are ok, but the original Mercury CDs sound so much better. These have a high end and harshness that is bad. They are just new remasters and not done too well. Get the originals. They have better sound."
5,Metropolitan Cow,I love this book! It is a great piece of literature that can teach all of us a valuable lesson.
5,The best album,"I'm Lulu Santos' biggest fan, I have all his albums, but this one is very special: his greatest hits come together in a different way. Lulu is a very smart musician, he plays the guitar very well, and nothing compares to his performance in the stage. This album can show it perfectly, because it's alive, although it's unplugged. One of the best Brazilian's shows. He makes all the people dance and sing, since a child until the old. Buy it now, I'm sure you'll love it!"
5,Absolutely the BEST Chinese cookbook,"Put away all your other Chinese cookbooks. These recipes are straightforward and consistently excellent, and the photos are gorgeous. Warner is on the mark when she recommends specific brands of ingredients. What a shame it's such a difficult book to find!"
4,Interesting glimpse into Inuit culture,"I'm so glad Amazon finally got more copies of this CD! No one else seemed to be able to find it, not even a store that specialized in Native American music. I was first introduced to throat singing by the Tuvan musicians Huun-Huur-Tu and wanted to see what the Inuit version was like. These two women create incredible and hypnotic sounds, imitating wild animals and other aspects of nature. The only reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that for one, this CD is very short; and, though I am pleased with it, I was expecting something a little more 'musical'. I couldn't get the track samples to work on my computer, so I ordered it 'blind', so to speak. This is a great record for people who like the sound of throat singing, or are interested in Inuit cultural artifacts, but it's not something you would listen to for musical enjoyment. It's also a little expensive, but at least the money is going to two worthy recipients, and not Britney Spears' private jet fund."
3,"interesting, but...","this is a very interesting cd, and I am glad it is now in my family's collection of world music. However...If you have no idea what throat singing is, and are interested in teaching children about arctic region cultures, this may not be the type of music you are looking for. A dvd of throat singing might be more appropriate. A CD of throat singing does not sound appropriate for children, and you will have to explain to parents what it is. You really need pictures to explain it, as the verbal explanation doesn't help.So, if this is a purchase for a general audience that is unfamiliar with this genre, try to listen to some throat singing first. Otherwise, this is very fun to listen to."
2,thumbs down,"While the women stand around the christmas tree naked, lay together in bed naked, open presents naked, and play with a snowman naked, that's all this video offers. No eroticism is to be had and there is no contact among the females. It starts out with great anticipation when the narrator describes 4 sexy sorority sisters snowed in on christmas eve wearing short skirts and looking positively innocent. Yet it fizzles when the editing jumps all too quickly to clothes falling on the floor and the girls throwing tinsle at each other. Great possibilities lost. The subsequent vignettes are, unlike the girls, flat. This is not a video of the caliber of other Playboy triumphs like Girlfriends. Very disappointing. If you like watching girls with implants standing or lying naked, buy it. If you want some girl/girl action or at least some eroticism, let this one pass."
3,santa's little helpers mmm good!,This was a pretty good DVD. wish there was more nefeteri she is so gorgeous but overall this is a keeper DVD with a seasonal flava. It could of been more creative. the jennifer walcott bonus feature is good she has great curves and artistically expresses herself well! But i rated it 3 because too many blondes would of liked more diversity. but these playmates have alot when there unrapped for this feature. look forward to more.
1,Hard to Get Excited About this One,"The title tells it all. Not a very stipulating video. Playboy has run its course with this type of slick, silicon fueled video. Pass on this one."
2,Wonderful -- until it breaks ...,"The extra features on this Sonic Screwdriver (the changeable ink nib, the sound effect, and so forth) are nice, and the sound effect is reasonably authentic (if recorded a little bit quietly).The problem is just that it isn't very well-made; just carrying it in a purse for one day with no major incident was enough to break the mechanism. First the light stopped working, then the switch that opens it just came off entirely, the screw totally stripped so it couldn't be put back together.If you just want a display or costume piece this will do nicely (but don't expect its features to necessarily work). As a child's toy? Not a chance. It can't even survive being carried around and put through its basic functions, let alone the rough treatment a child would give it."
2,cheap,"This was a bit of a let down. I realize its a toy, but it feels like something that would come with candy in it. The sound is barely audible and you can hardly tell the two sounds apart. As a kid I used a metal tire pressure guage as my sonic screwdriver and it at least had some weight to it. It is a replica of a high tech instrument but the casing looks like prehistoric stone, like a ""Flintstones"" toy. If they made these smaller and out of metal with some quality sound I would buy it. I will keep this and put it on a shelf, but I wish they had put a little more quality and value into it. There are probably more 40 yr old geeks who would like to have a quality replica than there are 10 year olds who nees something that is about as well made as a pez dispenser."
5,This thing makes me smile everyday!,"Yeah, I'm a thirty-something kid still stuck in her childhood years... <Sigh...> But when I saw the Sonic Screwdriver for sale, I HAD TO HAVE IT! And I'm so glad I bought it! The sound on mine is pretty darn good, but I do wish the light was a bit brighter. The Psychic Paper erasable ""pad"" is a lot of fun too when you write messages in the invisible ink. I take it to work and write stuff about my co-workers when they tick me off - and they're none the wiser. If you're a true fan of the series and love stupid little gadgets that bring a smile to your face - this is a must have."
4,Fun for any fan.,"If you're a fan of the ninth or tenth doctor, this item is a must. The UV light is a little dim, but not too noticeably different than the light in the series. The sonic screwdriver plays the sound and lights up in either extended or closed position, but not in the middle (which is a bit annoying). I really wish this still came with the psychic paper, but ah well. I'm still happy with this purchase."
4,Great fun for the doctor who fan,"This is a great fun little toy. It looks like the sonic from the 10th doctor. Once side extends and lites up in a blue uv light. The other end has either a UV ink pen (writing can be seen by shining the light from the other end on it,) or a regular pen tip. I would recomend this for someone older as the construction is of light plastic and would not hold up to a lot of rough housing.However as a grown up, I find this great fun to keep around."
3,Don't get your expectations up,"The Dr. Who Sonic Screwdriver is not very sturdy. The light and sounds are a little cheesy, but it's a kinda neat toy in its own right. It is definitely NOT for little kids, but more for Dr. Who collectors. The play value is limited. The ""psychic paper"" is comes with is just a little black fold-over vinyl wallet with nothing inside. The UV light on the other end of the screwdriver is fun to play with for a little bit, but it loses it's charm very quickly. It's nice to be able to have a toy from the Dr. Who series, especially if you're a big fan (like me!), but I think they could've done a better job if they just spent a little more time and money."
3,Wishing for more quality,"Don't get me wrong here--I love the sonic screwdriver as much as the next fan, but I really wish this toy was made a little better. Real buttons would be nice, and it would be cool if it wasn't so obvious that I was sliding flawed plastic through flawed plastic every time I extended the neck. Also, only one ""button"" works at a time, one when the head is extended, one when it's retracted. I feel like this product's design could have been improved a lot. Cool to have it, and I'm sure it's much closer to the true design than the flashlight, but I'm tempted to try and create one of my own that's made of more real parts."
4,Fun surprise,My husband and son recieved these as Christmas presents and have had fun with them. We did find it is better to keep them out of reach of little ones as the pen nibs don't have a latch and are easy for a child to pull off.
4,A Good First Generation Sonic,"While having the removable tip and UV ink is probably fun for the young ones, I'd prefer to have a Sonic that had a permanently attached tip. Nothing some crazy glue probably won't fix.From general use, the slide switch cover on mine has come off several times but it's been easy to snap it back on...so far.It claims 2 sound effects and it does actually have 2 but you practically have to have it up to your ear to hear the difference as they sound almost identical at arm's length. (Did I get a bad sound chip?)Being the first toy/prop marketed for the new Who, this is a very good effort. But hopefully, an improved version will be produced soon. I'd recommend this for any Who fans ages 10-910."
3,"Louder, please","It's a fun reproduction, lots of amusement to play with the item while watching ""Doctor Who"".Biggest drawback is that the sound isn't low, it's practically nonexistant. While it may be great for those kids among us whose age is mid-20s or later, a schoolchild won't have as much fun because you can barely hear it."
4,10th-11th Doctor Sonic Screw Driver,"The 10th and 11th Doctor's Sonic Screw Driver is very sturdy. It's bigger than I thought it would be, and from what I hear it's close in size to the one used on screen. Great for kids and adults alike. I love the fact that it also doubles as a pen. I will definitely buy another one. Now if you'll excuse me I have some universe saving to do."
3,"As expected, but needs improvement","As a die-hard Doctor fan, I was excited to get the sonic screwdriver. My experience is somewhat mixed though.The reviews faulting the durability and overall quality of this item are spot-on. The toy seems fragile and would definitely NOT stand up to serious play- don't buy it for a child under 20 years old. The whole extension assembly is very weak, I almost never use it in a nopen position.The sound is too faint, but it is audible, but come on- it's a SONIC screwdriver- the sound should be loud enough to hear across a room.The psychic paper wallet is not impressive at all, just a cheap plastic wallet with a white writing surface.All that said, the good points are that it is a faithful reproduction of the prop in the show, and the UV light is really cool.The best thing this toy could be used for is as a template for making my own new sonic screwdriver out of metal on a lathe, and inserting the electronics from this one into it."
4,"No ""Psychic Paper Wallet"" included and overpriced.","I just purchased this product under the impression it came with the ""Psychic Paper Wallet"" and payed 29.99 for this. The same product is advertised on this same site for 19.99 without the Wallet. Why would I pay 10$ more for the same thing? VERY misleading images and reviews on this product, unless you just want the screwdriver and want to pay more money. All that being said it is a very fun item to have and the seller has contacted me in regards to the confusion. Check the dates on these reviews, the Psychic Paper wallet version is discontinued and does not exist on this site."
5,Best sonic screwdriver I own!,I like this sonic screwdirver much better than my last sonic screwdriver. It would sometimes blow a hole in a door when I was onlt trying to pick the lock. Something to do with the power regulator I think.
3,Dr Who Sonic screwdriver.,"Sonic Screwdriver.My eight year old grandson has hardly stopped playing with the screwdiver, and it draws out his imagination as he plays with it."
4,Sonic screwdriver,"Pretty good toy. I wished it was more realistic as in metal, not plastic. But it lights up and noises are good"
5,A Real Workout for Your Soundsystem and your Ears,"This is a Re-issue in 24bit sound and on a 24k. Gold Disc Organist Jean Guillou delivers his transcripttion of Mussorgsky's Pictures done not on a piano or with an orchestra, but on the Pipe Organ. His performance is first rate! True to the Composer in every way. The Dorian engineers have done the whole thing justice by making this a recording that puts the Organ in the room with the listener, and the Organ is so faithfully recorded that included with the booklet is a warning about being careful with the volume levels. This recording will truly test the bass response of your speaker system and give you a performance that is not easily forgotten. As an addition Three of the dances from Stravinsky's ""Petouchka"" are included. All in all an excellent disc."
3,Best of the series?,"Dare Wright, A Gift from the Lonely Doll (Houghton Mifflin, 1963)Perhaps the best, and according to the jacket copy the best-loved, of the Lonely Doll books is A Gift from the Lonely Doll, originally published in 1963. In this episode, Edith (the titular character) decides to make a Christmas present for Mr. Bear-- a long knitted scarf. Little Bear, always the heckler, tells Edith constantly that the scarf is going to be entirely too long. He's right, but Edith solves the dilemma in a creative way.This is the only installment of the series I've read where Edith and the bears actually seem to operate as a family unit, with no absentee parenting or weirdly erotic scenes of punishment. A good little book, one I'd actually consider giving to my kid. ***"
3,"a lovely Christmas gift, but...","Like all Lonely Doll books, this story is completely charming and a wonderful Christmas gift for a teddy-loving child. But be warned, the paperback copy I purchased was disappointing because all the photographs were really quite blurry. That is why my rating was only 3 stars though Edith and the bears personally deserve more!"
2,Dsappointing,"I really enjoyed the first book I read in this series, ""Friday, the Rabbi Slept Late"". But this one was too much talk and hardly any mystery. The mystery part only starts more than half way through the book. As I already said, disappointing!"
1,Just not my taste,Bought Kindle version. Gave up about 20 pages in. May return to the book and give it another try. We'll see.
5,GOOD,"buy this with Joyce Chen 26-0013, 10-Inch Bamboo Steamer Set, and they work very well. you need this ring, if the steamer set size couldn't match your pot very well."
3,good,"This was a necessary product to turn my pots in to a steamer pot for my bamboo steamer basket, it helps a lot when i don't want to ue my wok."
5,I love it!,"I use it every time when I steam dumplings, buns..., It works great, I love it very much !!! It is good quality too!"
4,Great case but wish was smaller,This is a great aluminum case for your iPod. Probably the best protection you can get. The clip-on belt clip is very rugged as well. You can plug in your iPod and the headphones while the case is closed. The front of the case opens for full access. My only complaint is that it is a one-size-fits-all for iPods and thus is fatter to accomodate the older iPods. If you have a newer one you get a case that is fatter than it needs to be and has some extra room you'll need to add some extra padding to. I assume the iPod Mini case doesn't have this problem.
3,It's Really not That Bad......,"Let's preface this by typing that it is a really good phone...... I just don't like that dark, menacing color. But there are a good many choice of ring types and you can personalize your phone to your own settings. I didn't like the vibration option of the phone. It doesn't vibe very hard. I used to own a Motorola Timport (the silver one). That bad boy vibrated STRONG!! But this is still a good phone. It's not worth the [cost], but it's a good phone."
1,i90-EVERYONE HAS IT,-----------EVERYBODY HAS IT-DONT GET IT-GET A NEWER PHONE-ITS A PEACE OF JUNK-OLA
1,Nextel Customer Service is horrible,Nextel has the worst customer service. I have called them several times and talked with numerous service reps. I have asked to talk to supervisors and asked for call backs and have never recieved one. Nextel needs to start to care about their customers they have now rather than trying to get more customers. I have three phones and have been talking to them on and off for months and still nothing with my bill has been taken care of. I bought three i90s and was suppose to recieve them at a reduced cost and when I got my first bill I had the wrong plans and I was overcharged for the phones. Nextel is terrible.
3,Good basic phone with a few annoyances,"I've had my phone for 4 months now and my overall experience with the phone has been average. The calls sound great, the speaker phone works very well, and the two way feature is great. The down side of the phone is the user interface. It is not very intuitive to use like a Samsung phone. It is a huge improvement from older Motorola models but still has a long way to go. The battery life is average. I have to charge the phone every other day and I consider myself a light user. Lastly, the belt clip was design so that you can't see the display when the phone is in the clip. You have to remove the phone from the clip to see who is calling you!"
2,"Good, but...","Right now nextel doesn't exactly cut it for me. I live/work/travel to many out of the way places and rarely did a nextel phone work where I am. If I had to reccomend a phone with direct connect- style capability, I would reccomend Motorola's v60p (on verizon) but if you're not looking for d/c... go with Sprint. You'll like Sprint's data service more."
1,On my THIRD repair in two months,"I received this phone and was please mostly with the speakerphone function. It is a bit larger than comparable units because of that, but was worth it to me. HOWEVER, two weeks into owning the unit, it started reading incompatible charger every time I plugged in any charger. I took it in for service who was less than helpful, but eventually repaired it on-site only after I told them to cancel the service. It worked for about a week, then it restarted and I had to return to Amazon.com (which I must say was helpful service over the phone). Now, the replacement is doing the same thing along with turning itself off periodically. I am about to call to arrange return of this phone as well."
4,I90c,"I've realy enjoyed this phone a lot! The size is perfect, it's durable, and the features are the bomb. Great phone, I can't wait to buy the I95c."
1,Terrible customer service,"I have to say that Nextel has the worst customer service of any company I've ever dealt with. The phone worked OK, and coverage was good for my area (SF Bay), but I won't get another Nextel product due to the response of their customer service department. I made about 6-8 calls to that department, and never once did they get my request for billing changes, service changes, or anything else right. They also refused to let me cancel my contract (according to terms stated on the contract) and denied having received faxed copies of the contract or having talked with me before about it. I'll certainly want to deal with another company in the future."
2,"Phone is good, service is bad!","I bought this phone back in dec 2002. It came with a rebate for $150. I filled out the forms and mailed it to Nextel, NEVER receiving the rebate! I called and they told me that there was nothing they could do. That if I called sooner they could have had me fill out another form. Well I waited so long because the form I filled out said wait a min of 12 weeks! Also they have been messing up my bill every month, charging me for minutes that should be in my plan, PLUS my plan has been changing. The phone is good however Nextel as a company is not the best."
1,terrible interface and battery life,"I've had this phone for a year now and I can tell you that it is one of the worst phones I've had. I loved it the first month because it was cool but the daily annoyances of the phone drove me crazy. The interface doesn't make any sense at all and you must use multiple key strokes to do simple funtctions like switching to vibrate mode. Motorola needs to take a look at samsung phones. You don't even need a manual to use it.Also, because Nextel service is power hungry, your battery will need to be charged daily. This is not a function of the phone so much as the service. There isn't away around this one. Unless you have a real need to use Direct Connect, don't get Nextel. Service is poor outside of cities."
1,Bad Service,"The two way radio is cool but the size is just a bit big. I believe service is equally important as its product so I would like to share my opinion about Nextel.What I really don't like about Nextel is its service, computer in customer service dept. is often down and it's not easy to get through the customer service (it's always busy dial tone). Not mentioning the mistakes it often occurred on my billing statement. I wouldn't recommand Nextel as a trusted service."
3,the i90 is okay,my main gripe is that the two way radio feature cuts off alot. i use it for business and i find it very irritating that at least 50% of the time i use the two way radio there's interference. the previous nextel model had much better reception and i wish we would of kept them though the battery life of that one wasn't as good as this model. yes it has a whole bunch of nice features but when it comes to using it for the purpose intended it sort of doesn't meet my expectations.
5,best phone i ever had,i used to have verizon phone before i got this phone...i used to get bad service and it was staticy...so i went looking for a new phone and everyone i new told me to get nextels i90...when i got this phone you could see the difference in services...the nextel phone was getting better service then the verizon...when i talk on the phone it is clear and i love the direct connect...i also love how no matter how many times you drop the phone it still goes...if u are looking for a new phone i recommend this phone.
4,"Good Phone, BAD service","I just recently transferred my number from Cingular Wireless to Nextel. The i90c is an extremely reliable, well-built, fully featured phone, but Nextel on the other hand is a crappy service provider:""Please hold while the Nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located...""That's what people OFTEN hear when they try to call me, before it cuts to my voicemail. I've gotten many many many complaints from people who tell me they called, but my phone never even rang! I think Nextel has way too many customers than they can handle, and us consumers have to suffer the consequences.Oh, and if you ever need to contact Nextel for any type of customer support, make sure you have at least 2 hours set aside for that ordeal because NO ONE WHO WORKS FOR NEXTEL KNOWS ANYTHING! Get used to being transferred from one idiot to the next...and you'll even be disconnected purposely on occasion after you've been on hold for 45 minutes straight. VERY FRUSTRATING, to say the least!"
2,Good and Bad Features,"The good news! The date book feature eliminated the use of my PDA. You can set appointments and the i90 will alarm you when you want to be alarmed. It is getting smaller by Nextel standards but still is heavy. The voice dialing is a feature that just is not used by me because it does not perform as well as some Qualcomm phones I have owned. Illuminated display is good. The bad. It is not as easy to navigate as the old i1000. You have to push buttons, flip open the cover etc. to get to desired locations. i1000 was easy to dial as cell or connect with two way. this i90 phone is far more difflicult to navigate. Service is expensive. I would stay with cheap cell service unless you absolutely need the two way direct. Wait until they come out with an updated phone. This is like windows me, a fancy upgrade with little valuable tools save for the date book."
3,Cool phone if you can keep it powered up.,"I switched to Nextel after AT&T did not seem interested in keeping up with the jones in the area of new technology. I had a 2.5 year old mitsu t250 which was the most advanced phone they offered. I ordered 2 i80 phones first, I found the 65+ ours of stand by was more like 20~24. So I was told the I90c would be better, it was by a few hours, maybe 36. a far cry from the advertised 75. talk time is not bad, I don't think it is close to 200mins, but with nextels prices who could afford to test that.The phone itself is great, nice features, I like the vib/ring option where the phone will vibrate twice and then ring. Java Apps are cool(I don't use them) I do use the feature that lets you records parts of your calls.Overall if you get a desktop charger and a second battery it is a great phone."
2,Low down dirty battery time,Pro'ssmallest of Nextel's Flip modelsDirect Connect (will save cellular minutes if other party has Nextel)Blue LightEasy MenuCon'sBattery life is minimal last about 45-60mins tops. Bring a chargerCoverage in West Hollywood was bad and forget calling the boss if you are in the canyon. I had to use my friend's t-mobile phone to call in late.high priced plans.
5,Great deal with Nextel!,"This phone is a huge step up from the standard Nokia phone I used to have. This phone has so many fun features, it's small (but not too small) and the blue backlighting is pretty cool! This is the best deal on a Nextel phone that I have ever seen and I wanted a Nextel because my dad has one and I always admired his phone and it's features. With [the] rebates on this phone it's a great time to BUY!!!"
2,"Problems with reception, menu and some functions.","The phone seems to work well at times but poorly at other times. Incoming vioce fades in and out in my home. Outside of my home I often here echos or buzzing sounds in the background. The ringer doesn't work in the AM until I check the volume. It is always up but until I actually push the increase volume control the ringer stays silent. I was able to set it to vibrate so at least I can feel the first call of the morning just in case I forget to check the volume. The earphone is difficult to hear even with the volume at maximum. It is difficult to navigate around the menu. The message service tells my customers ""You are being transfered to an automated ansewering system."" This is annoying to callers who often hang up rather than wait for my message followed by the beep. Had I known this prior to signing up I would not have selected a Nextel as my cellular co.."
3,"Looks sharp, then on the floor in sharp pieces","Quality is more than in line for the price and the plunger is all steel, no cheap plastic. Fit and finish was good. I say, ""was,"" because the product has an engineering snafu - the metal legs. Unlike the presses I've owned with rubber contacts on the legs, this one both sounds terrible on a countertop and slides too easily across a wet one. I was wiping the counter, mildly miscalculated the sponge's relation to the press, and then the press was on its way over the edge and on to my floor. Approximately one million tiny glass shards later, I was in search of a replacement."
5,Great Press,"Easy to clean. I love the size - it's makes just the right amount of coffee for 2. And, it's been dropped a couple times without breaking so it's pretty durable."
2,8 cups of fail,"Wife bough the pot at the grocery store on sale for $11. The next day, the thing throws a crack while making a half-pot.I looked at it when I got home, and made the following observations:The ""stainless"" looks suspect. Might be chrome plated mild steel.The band that attaches to the top of the handle contacts the glass in 3 places, with enough space to fit a matchbook cover in about halfway around. I can't tell you how much force the band is exerting on the glass, except to say that it was apparently enough to cause it to crack.The poor workmanship extends to the feet, which do not sit evenly on the glass. I'm glad the unit cracked up top and not on the bottom."
3,Wonderful but fragile,"This press works wonderfully, however it has a fatal flaw. The first press I ordered arrived broken. The company immediately replaced it. The second press worked great but was also soon shattered when it tumbled from the counter into the sink. Not the most durable product."
5,Great Quality,The coffee press is heavy and very durable. It's simply to clean because I just put the whole thing in the dishwasher.
2,Not very good quality,It wobbles when you pour hot water into it and there no markings on the glass to measure cups of hot water as you use it to make coffee. It is also difficult to clean as the glass tube does not separate from its metal holder.
3,lighter weight and prices better.,I make a lot of copies of reference material that gets folded and put into project files so the lighter weight would lend to not having such bulky folded drawings. I had been getting it from a local supplier in the 20# weight but like your service and prices better.
4,Good Quality Paper,"I use this paper for printing construction plans from my HP DesignJet. I haven't had any problems with jamming, fouling the printer, and other issues."
2,Image quality not good enough,"I have always used Universal paper, and will again. This Bright White simply does not allow the image to stand out on the paper. In fact it makes it look rather dull and lackluster. I gave it 2 stars because of the price. If your sign/poster is for a one-off event, this might do."
2,Should come with ear plugs!,"Don't buy this for a child unless you want to be hated by the parents. It's noisy, takes days to work, and the chemicals it comes with stain carpets forever. I don't know who could stand to listen to this thing running for the over 24 hours it recommends."
4,Does the job,"We gave our son this rock tumbler for his 6th birthday. All of the reviews were so bad, but I decided to buy it anyway and am glad that I did. It works just fine for the price. We keep it in the basement so we can't hear it. It turned rough rocks shiny, so we were all quite impressed. My son made a cool necklace from one of the finished rocks."
1,So disappointing!!,"My daughter was a little ""rock hound"", when she was small. She found all sorts of beautiful things, and loved to ""pan"" for rought jewels during our vacations in the NC mountains. So it was with great delight that I found this rock tumbler, and gave it to her one Christmas. It did nothing but overheat -- and nearly set our house on fire. A couple of years later, a dear friend of the family (not knowing our history with the tumbler), gave my daughter the SAME gift. I thought it was worth giving it another try -- after all, the first one COULD have just been a ""dud"". No such luck. The second machine did nothing, overheated, and I threw it out.I would never buy one of these again."
3,Requires Patience and Preserverence,"I had been told it requires a lot of time to polish rocks. I had no idea that in addition to the time there are multiple checks, drains and refills to complete a batch of small stones (the tumbler only works on pebble size stones). Only give this to someone with the patience and perserverence to follow the process through a week or more. I will say the stones are really polished at the end of the cycle.The polisher is really loud. We had to put it in the garage so we could sleep. Also note that the tumbler only comes with enough materials for 1-2 tumbling cycles. Then you need to order more polishing powder.The instructions say you should NOT put the liquid from the tubler into your home plumbing."
2,SKIP THIS VERSION,"My sons loves to collect rocks and we thought this would be a perfect gift. It did not turn out so well. I would agree with the reviewer who suggested a better grade rock tumbler.This item looked cheap out of the box which made us question this purchase. We tried calling Discovery Store for return information but all returns are paid at buyers cost whatever the reason. We were not willing to pay $[...] to return something that cost us $[...]. Note that ALL Discovery Stores have been closed. Okay, we're keeping it so let's try it.This rock tumbler takes several stages with exacting instructions to get a finished and polished stone - we are talking weeks. As already noted, the sound is EXTREMELY LOUD. This would never work in an apartment and did not work in our house. No matter how far away we placed it - you could hear the grating (possibly amplified?) noise of tumbling rocks. Not fun.I would recommend saving up your money and get a better grade tumbler."
2,Prepare for noise and 3 weeks of waiting,"I can't say this is a bad product. If you have a shed in your backyard (too loud for the garage even!) with electricity, and about 15-20 days of patience with a little ""work"" in-between the four stages this is alright. The work is actually the fun part. Changing the different powders inside and seeing the progress you are making. (also the tumbler needs cleaning after every step..but I imagine this would be true with any tumbler). My son and I have successfully completed 1 batch of rocks and are half way through our second batch. No instant ""fun"" with this product, but satisfaction if you make it through round 1."
2,Lasts about 3 uses...,"The first time we used this, the kids loved the outcome. The rocks were polished, sparkling and definitely an educational event. They waited 2 weeks to see a normal rock turn into something beautiful. However, the noise level is VERY loud. We kept it in the basement and you could hear it two floors above. Also, when we went to use it a third time, the barrel leaked, then the rubber strip wouldn't grip on the gear so it wouldn't turn. We bought it a year ago and it lasted about 9 months. I would spend more money on a better, more sound insulated product."
4,Second time around the barrel wore out,I had a tumbler growing up and bought this one for my daughter. The new design is better then the old style. No slipping going on at all. Still really noisy though. It has a great option of setting the number of days to tumble it. The problem with our tumbler though is after step 2 of our second set of rocks the soft plastic of the tumbler wore through. I don't think we can duck tape it because it would interfere with the rotation. I'm not sure if I can order a new barrel without paying the price of a new machine. If it weren't that the barrel wore out I would say this is a terrific rock tumbler. It is such a better design and functions better then my old one.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,This product is the worst rock tumbler I've ever encountered. Doesn't consistently spin causing constant restarts and an unknown tumbling time. I've had rock tumblers in the past but none as bad as this. Do yourself a favor and select a different one to purchase.
2,Hasn't been very durable,"My grand-daughter likes rocks and I thought this would be a nice thing for us to do. It is, but everyone has to be patient. You are looking at @ 3 weeks between all 4 steps. The tumbler does make some noise, so try to find a out of the way location. Take caution not to overload the rocks... easy to do. We got the unit last summer and within the first 2 steps, the drum started leaking at the seam. The seams are thin compared to the drum itself (you can see light through it). It was replaced by the store. This summer, we got it out again. All together, we probably ran about 3 batches. The lid or cover has to be on for the tumbler to operate. There is a plastic tab that holds and releases the cover. That tab broke this summer. I have held it in place with tape. Now the drum is leaking again. I understand that it is a ""toy"" for a child, but I am a little disapointed with the durability. I think this tumbler will be tumbling a new way out of my garage!"
3,Barrel Issues,"We bought this tumbler so that we could get started tumbling rocks. It was great for the first two loads of rocks we tumbled. Unfortunately, during the third load the cheap plastic barrel got holes in it at the seams and the slurry ended up mucking up the motor. This is a great toy to introduce children to rock tumbling, but if you think your kids are going to want to make rock tumbling a long term hobby, you'd be better off spending a little more money on aLortone 3A Lapidary Rock Gem Rotary 3 Lb. Tumbler Newor aThumbler's Tumbler MP-1 Rock Tumbler."
2,????,"This product is hard to use,hard to set upand ..not very fun.It is cool and a cool gift,but i would not recommend."
2,suggest pay more for a semi-pro unit,"I bought this unit for my 9-year old daughter. It was easy to use but extremely loud. We live in an apartment and I was worried I was disturbing the neighbors - it really was that loud. It also burned out during the third tumbling step- we probably overloaded it, which is easy to do. I then bought a Lortone tumbler, which was about twice the price of this tumbler (sold on many web sites). However, what a pleasure to use. It has a rubber liner and tumbles so quietly it sound like a day at the ocean. We have tumbled several batches of rocks with the Lortone tumbler with no problems. I suggest ponying up the extra money if noise and durability are important to you."
4,VERY COOL but can be noisy,"I got this as a birthday present. I was surprised that it did not take very long at all. One bad part is that it is noisy. Even though it does not take a long time, have patients because it takes 2-7 days for the process to complete. I was extremly happy with the results. It is worth more than what you pay. It was a little hard to find the refil kits but i found them."
1,Poor,"I bought 2 of these one for myself and one for my grandaughter, both have stopped within the 2nd step and required alot of re-starts. It is also makes so much noise you can hear it throughout our home."
5,"Fast,Easy,And The Power BIlls ARE LOW!",Discovery Next Generation Rock Tumbler is better then other rock tumbler because it fast dosn't even take a month maybe more then two days or three two for 1 load and 2 for 3 loads really i thought it would take more than a mounth but it din't my old one took about years! to finsh and the power bill was to high so my dad made my un plug it and i could only use once and awlihe but he saw this and got it for me he was facanited by how quick it finsh i wa glad to i made a small tiny bussinese makind neckless even though i'm 12 i charge 2$ for ever rind neckless and earrings till i ran out of glue and polish ECt but you can use homemade glue and stuff the polish and thing you don't need them!! so i never got a refill because it never use it even though it wan't glossy it was nice and shiny what the diffrent? anyways i love it i give three 5 stars and one 4 star because it was fun not educational hope you'll like it :D
4,The Great Miler's Word on his Career,"An enjoyable read on the former world record holders running career particularly his HS phenomenal success to his tragic fall at Munich. Wish that Ryun could have experienced the atheletic sponsorship of today instead of being forced to bag groceries to train and to go pro in the failed pro track venture. He also talks of his religous experience and his self critique which is hard to ever buy that Ryun was ever a bad person. Got mine autographed at the Shamrock Marathon in VA. Beach. I still love the an exciting ""Jim Ryun Story"" by Coorder Nelson. That book is exciting read of the competetiveness of younster Ryun running against the great Peter Snell, Kip Keino and the American Jim Grelle. The action photographs are thrilling. Would be great to have both books."
2,Terrible,"Well, not much good to say about this one. The image quality is terrible and they've managed to remove all traces of sexiness from these girls. Don't bother."
1,Appallingly bad,"This is one of the most tragic wastes of female beauty I&#65533;ve ever seen Playboy produce. ... This had to be one of the most unexciting Playboy videos I&#65533;ve seen. ... Almost every Playmate segment in this video has guys in it. Then there is the terrible production style: extreme close-ups, dizzying jump-cuts, cuts from a nude Playmate to her fully clothed on a bicycle and back again until you want to scream. The crowning absurdity is the Brande Roderick sequence. She rolls about on a bed in a bra and panties while a voice-over reads bad erotic poetry in an English accent, while the video cuts to shots of the poetry and some middle-aged guy in 18th century dress that is supposed to be the poet. She gets less screen time than the shots of the poetry. It&#65533;s so terrible it&#65533;s hilarious."
4,A great selection of beautiful models,"I purchased this DVD based on the fact that it starred Nichole Van Croft and found several other beautiful models contained within: Irina Voronina, Lauren Michelle Hill, Shannon Stewart, Brande Roderick, Buffy Tyler, Miriam Gonzolez, and Crist Nicole. The others were okay but not great. The best sequences have to be Shannon Stewart and Miriam Gonzolez. The others are good but not incredible. My only gripe would have to be the high-pitched squeal that is Nichole Van Croft's voice. Looking at her frame you would never guess that she would have a helium voice.Definately a great addition to any collection."
4,Playboy: 2002 Video Playmate Calendar,"I've been collecting the Video Calendars since 1992 and must say this is the best so far. Beautiful women, close up shots, and did I say beautiful women? This seems to be a great production piece and the bonus features are pretty good. You get data sheets for the playmates and a listing of every playmate's video and a trip down memory lane for older playmate calendars. Sure it's the same old music and you'll probably need to buy other videos to get the rest of the older playmate videos, but Shannon Stewart, Nichole Van Croft, Crista Nicole and Lauren Hill makes it worthwhile."
4,Good show,"While this isn't as good as the 2000 video calendar, it makes up for the shortcomings of the 2001 video calendar. Nicole Van Croft, Ms. January, starts off the disk on a high note, and it maintains pretty well. There are some parts that borrow from other sources: Buffy Tyler's piece has her in a whipped cream bikini like the movie Varsity Blues.The bonuses are pretty good. You get the wallet calendar (like last year) and you also get a complete directory of playmates and their appearances. It's searchable by either playmate name or date of the appearance. There's also a retrospective playmate video calendar (1990) as well as a couple previews."
4,Lighthearted western humor.,I think it is the way he puts the stories together. His writing style itself adds to the humor of the stories. Only a real cowboy could ever think and write this way. It is worth having in your library.
1,CURSED OPPORTUNITIES IS CORRECT,"THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL . IM CURSING BECAUSE OF THE OPPORTUNITES I MISSED OUT ON TODAY WHILE I SAT THROUGH THIS MOVIE WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.BAD ACTING ,BAD SCRIPT ,BAD EVERYTHING .I WOULDN'T RECOMEND THIS MOVIE EVEN IF IT WAS FREE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE ."
4,Great accounting of action,This book allowed me to look through the eyes of a person who was there. My father was a forward observer for the 113th and I believe he was there on that hill with the author. thanks for the opportunity to live it also.
2,"Obviously, this was put out to be first one on the shelf","There are so many typos in this book, that it is obvious the publisher just wanted to be first to get one out on this exam. There are numerous items which are just plain WRONG, and if you don't have enough experience with the topic, you will be setting yourself up for failure on the exam. I gave it 2 stars because I haven't finished the book yet, and wanted to be optimistic that I would see improvement toward the end. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone who is not familiar enough with W2K web solutions to figure out when the authors are right....and when they are wrong."
1,Do NOT buy,"...I had been using this publisher for all of my exams followed with Transceder software, but this book is the worst. The typo are numberous aand horrible. Several statements were just wrong and the book contradicts itsself in multiple places...UPDATE:I finished reading the book and it was an 80% waste of time. I finally found a good practice test and found that I was completly unprepared. This book doesn't even scratch the surface of what the exam requires you to know. Furthermore it spent great deal of time on simple subjects that (since you reading this book you have probably passed the other required exams) you probably already know. I have decided to just take the designing AD exam, there just isn;t enough good study material for this exam. This book was a complete waste of money. At least I bought it used."
5,Wonderful,"This is a great stethoscope and blood pressure cuff. Seemes to be very good quality. I have duchenne muscular dystrophy is hard for my nurse to hear for my blood pressure because of weakening heart and this stethoscope picks up everything. The book pressure cuff is accurate as it was exactly or within a point of my automatic blood pressure cuff. I got this one as a backup.It is in my favorite color of orange although I don't know why they show a blue one. Throws you off after a little bit you see it says orange. I guess they have many other colors, but be careful don't just go by the picture."
1,racist undertones,"this tone of the book regarding race is in my opinion, biased. for example he seems to have cherry picked a few genes such as microcephalin that occur in europeans and asians and not africans. This trying to suggest the genetic intellectual inferiority of africans and the superiority of westerners. What a pity that James Watson signed his name on it. If you read between the lines the rest of the book follows the same pattern, trying to find genetic reasons as to why the development of western civilizations. My advice is, be cautious not to take everything at face value with this book."
4,Interesting,"I found this to a very interesting book. I especially enjoyed the way the author presented the information, not as completed fact, rather as the latest working hypothesis that is standing up to the tests of science. He offered alternative points of view and stated things clearly enough that layman, such as myself, could understand them. The controversial aspects of the book are actually fairly treated in contrast with what people have said about it. It does drag a bit in parts as some theories are explored in more detail than my interest could sustain. All in all, fascinating and informative."
5,"A great read, wonderfully written","Only rarely do I come across a book as fascinating and well written as this one. ""Before the Dawn"" is a grand synthesis of the latest findings from the human genome with what we know about our prehistory from archeology and other traditional fields. This book is much more satisfying than ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"", by Jared Diamond, though the two works do not deal with exactly the same issues. From Wade we now know that race is more than a ""social construct,"" though he steers clear of anything too controversial on the subject. We know much more about how humans evolved and spread around the globe. In the final chapter, he explains how culture itself puts evolutionary pressure on humans. It is an outstanding book."
4,Good scientific book about the origins of man,"A very nifty book about how the latest genetic discoveries are uncovering many secrets about the origins of humankind by New York Times science reporter Nicholas Wade. Among the many issues covered, using the latest scientific discoveries, are the exodus of homo sapiens from its birthplace in Africa, the origins of language, the split of human beings among many groups. Wade doesn't even shy away from controversial topics, like the origins and meaning of race. A good companion piece to Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", even though Diamond favors geographical determinism and downplays genes, in contrast to Wade."
4,Well worth reading,"In this truly fascinating book, Nicholas Wade tells the remarkable story of the human past. I learned a great deal and highly recommend reading it. Even though I didn't always agree with him on various points, the book is very well written and integrates the many aspects of humans' journeys over tens of thousands of years in an enjoyable format."
2,Ehhh,"I had to read this for a school assignment over summer break, then write a 9 page essay on it, and honestly it ruined my summer. I could not get through the book without being confused or bored by unnecessary information that Wade gave. If you are some kind of scientists I'm sure you will love it, but if you are looking for information on the topic of evolution just google or read a textbook. Wade can also be very subjective and not objective on some topics, which was quite frustrating. I do not think he has the credentials to write the book because he is only a reporter for the New York Times. If you enjoy massive data dumping and unclear answers to questions on evolution then Before the Dawn is the perfect book!"
1,"More support to the ""You're Only a Racehorse"" hypothesis","More crap from a ""science"" journalist supporting the meme that you're only as good as your genes. Sure sounds a lot like the Elizabethan Age: ""you're only as good as your breeding"".The rest of the book is basically just fallacious commentary supporting that thinly veiled elitist claim.On positive note, it very well-written (from a stylistic standpoint) and quite a smooth read - kinda like driving a Mercedes you just picked up from an uphosteler in Tijuana - only to find out the seats are stuffed with donkeyshit.Read at your own risk for becoming stupider - I sure feel that way after finishing it."
5,Brilliant.,"This is a marvelous summary of the literature, written beautifully for the layman. Exactly what I was looking for. Recommended highly."
5,A great read,"Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in human pre-history. A well written overview of human origins and culture that highlights recent findings in molecular genetics (DNA sequencing and gene function) that provide unique insights into where we came from and how we got here. Very read-able, the author does a great job of making the information accessible to, and understandable by, all."
5,Before the Dawn,This book is a quite comprehensive look at the prehistory of manbased on scientific findings. What new information comparative DNA analysis can tell us is a common theme. The author leans toward a more violent past for our ancestors than is popular among scientists today. He makes a good case for his prejudiced view. I relished the chapter on the evolution of languages as ameans of tracing our prehistoric past. I learned how difficult the process really is. I recommend the book for serious students of prehistory. Ralph Hermansen 8/14/06
3,Good DNA-Based Analysis of our Possible Evolutions,"A good evolution-genetics, based look at the possible developments of pre-humans and early pre-history humans. The difference here is that the assertions or ideas offerred in this book are compared and analysed against the genetic evidence we know or that can be inferred: eg. Mitochondrial and Y Chromosone analysis play a large part.It is a good Cook's Tour sort of book, but didn't get too much into things so did not hold my interest as much as other books. Case in point is that analysis of how Neanderthals were a separate species and why they died out. The amount of theories and the timelines make some of the assumptions a bit of a stretch, but again, that is how science is made and advances, by supposition and testing. But I just thought that there could be better analysis at parts... but that is also a lot to ask -- to encompass 250,000 Million years in 270 pages..."
2,This is why you shouldn't trust journalists to do science,"Before the Dawn is reasonably well written and certainly makes itself understandable, but it suffers from Wade's rather limited and biased sampling of knowledge on his subject (he seems to be completely unaware of the existence of Namibian rock art for example) and his own personal wacky ideas. It's a classic case of a science journalist trying to write on science, and why they should be approached with extreme caution. Some interesting facts interspersed throughout it, but definitely wouldn't suggest to anyone without enough background to spot where Wade is full of it."
2,"Who we are, where we came from, & how we got here!",This book is an accessible compilation of a huge amount of recently discovered material concerning the genetics of human history and how it squares with archaeology. It also puts to bed the myth that human evolution has stopped and shows how recent social developments may have led to changes in the human genome. This is a book for serious inquirers about human origins and makes the case for evolution in our hominid lineage. This is one of the best books I have read all year and I highly recommend it.
5,AMAZING!,"I had this album on vinyl years ago. It has been unavailable until quite recently in CD (or any other) form. This is a fusion MASTERPIECE. The guitar playing on Sky Church Hymn No 9 simply blows me away..........it's as good as anything that John McLaughlin was doing at the time. The rest of the album is SOLID, in the vein of early Return to Forever (the classic line-up with Stanley Clarke and Al DiMeola). Unfortunately, neither of the other David Sancious releases that I have heard come close to this one."
1,Too Long for Twin Bed,I ordered these for my son's twin bed. They are too long. Twin bed rails should be 75-76 inches long. These are 81 inches long. That is long enough for a queen sized bed! I am now in the process of sending them back and trying to get a refund.
5,Perfect for our antique bedframe,We needed bed rails for an wooden antique head/foot board (the original rails had long disappeared). These were of decent quality and were easily bolted onto the head and footboard.
2,Very overated album,"I will be honest, I was completely looking forward to this disc arriving when I ordered it from Monster records. I had read a lot about it, and am a huge fan of heavy psych rock, especially the obscure stuff from the early to mid 70's. Looking at the cover and reading reviews, I was sure this will be a heavy monster rock winner.Boy was I wrong!! This release is lame. It has some instances where they rock, but overall it is boring, and the songs go nowhere. The vocals are incredibly lacking of power, and the heavyness for the most part just is not there. This is the only cd that I have from this time period and this style that I have since sold. Don't believe the hype on this one!!"
1,agree with reviewer above,"i wholeheartidly agree with the above reviewer!..i was looking forward to this as well...but was wholly underimpressed!...i think monster records hype things beyond belief and all that i've gotten has failed to light any fire!..can't hold a candle to similar underground 70's acts like blues creation,night sun,bedemon,buffalo,etc!..pass on this one ERGO!"
4,Back to Basics,"I am a 4.0 tennis player, but ski most weekends in the winter and find that my strokes are inconsistent when I start playing again regularly in the spring. By reviewing this tape and going back to basics I find that I am easily able to correct my mistakes and find my form again. The format is concise and methodical and most importantly easily translates (visually) into improved stroke production ( or correction as in my case). MY only grievance is that there is no segment on the overhead..or at least a follow up video covering the overhead, lob, return of serve and serve variations."
4,Visual Tennis,"Could have covered the overhead, lob and return of serve, but does a real good job on the basic stokes. Emphasis is on a good simple, connected, repeatable stroke."
4,good,all things in the video is good for a biginner.but a little amount of content should be added about grip. it's hard to catch the correct form of grip by watching video only.
3,So cute...,"My daughter looked so adorable in her flower robe and using the hooded towel and washcloth set, but I must say these items do not wash well. After the first wash they were looking pretty dinjy- maybe try a delicate cycle?"
4,Wicked!!,"Moonlighting as a DJ now and then, this CD is always in my bag. It is probably Artful Dodgers best thing to date. This is also what remixing was meant to be. Each track is a gem of its own. Don't get fooled by Craig Davids name on the cover. Although he did co-write the song, his vocal appearance is very limited. The vocals by Robbie Craig however are the perfect match with the floor filler music. Why don't we hear more of this man? Also look for Woman Trouble CD Nr. 2, (available through Amazon.co.uk) featuring the video and the mother of all remixes: 'Sunkids future discotech edit'."
5,Anyone fancy a salmon trout?,"I confess that I purchased this book in error, thinking it was something to do with the Norwegian tobacco industry (a market that I had assumed was untapped, and at that time my ""next big thing""). It's not hard to see, though, that our mistakes can be every bit as rewarding as our intentions.Such was the case with this little book. Edwards's magnum opus compares favourably with its rivals that focus too much on the salmon end of things, without ever addressing the needs of the trout farmer (of whom I know many). In particular, food and allocation of space (more realistically, water) are addressed, and so, too, is the correct spelling of the words ""fjord"" and ""gravadlax""."
4,Yum,"This album made me think of summer, lying in the grass in a park in Copenhagen, drinking cheap beer that we'd picked up in germany on a bus trip filled with bad-smelling pensioners, trying to figure out where the music was coming from but not really caring that much."
4,For Sonnambula alone...,"I am glad that the other reviews are so enthusiastic, and I feel extremely fortunate to have snagged a copy for myself just a few weeks ago, because today I see that it's unavailable again! (I had waited several months -- pessimistically.) Among Balanchine ballets, I'm particularly fond of Sonnambula, not least for Rieti's irreverent but loving treatments of Bellini's swoon-inducing melodies. I made a videotape (poor quality) from a TV broadcast of the ABT performance with Mikhail Baryshnikov some years ago, and hoped at least to find the music on CD. I believe this recording is excellent, with a rich orchestral sound and especially sensitive phrasing and rubato in the more lyrical parts. The playing is not perfect -- there are a few intonation and ensemble flaws here and there, but not enough to seriously affect one's enjoyment. To anyone who's longing for a copy, hang in there, and you have my best wishes. (But I'm keeping my copy.)"
4,True Beauty,"Custer LaRue is one of my favorite singers. Such an expressive voice is hard to find. This is my favorite album of all the Baltimore Consort related artists. The recording and sound is, as is usual with Dorian, excellent. These songs are rich and beautiful. I especially like ""Lovely Willy"" and the version of ""All the Pretty Little Horses."" I give this disc my full recommendation."
4,A nice memento of Fifties ballet conducting,"I agree with both reviewers below about the merits of Felix Slatkin (a better conductor than his son Leonard) and Joseph Levine. In these Capitol recordings of familiar Tchaikovsky ballet suites, the sound is more genuinely like a pit orchestra than the super-virtuosic readings done by Karajan, James Levine, and dozens of others. No one would mistake the pickup groups known as the Hollywood Bowl Orch. and the Ballet Theater orchestra for big-name ensembles, but they play very well.Levine and slatkin both prefer a quick pace and lean textures, giving a freshness to their readings. Capitol's clean, clear vintage stereo is too edgy for ocmfort at times--it's not up to present-day standards--but I'm happy to recall two fine conductors in repertoire they knew very well."
3,"Truncated pieces, very disappointed","I was curious about the low price on this album and how they could fit so much amazing music on one disc. Duh, the pieces have been truncated. I guess this wouldn't matter to a lot of people, but knowing this music from dancing to it for years, I was disappointed by it."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"Pros:Small, not very noticeableWorks wellCons:Must be screwed on, which is cumbersomeWill NOT clamp onto the end of the headstock when not in useThis capo works much better than my other capo, which is the Nashville-style G7th capo that is spring loaded, standard clamp style. That capo buzzes because it doesn't always hold down the strings. This capo does indeed hold down the strings, but the cons are too much for me. I will be switching to another capo."
2,Easily the worst season of The X-Files.,"The ninth season of The X-Files is easily the weakest season of them all, regardless of one's opinion of the eigth season. It became very apparent that the writers had just run out of ideas with the introduction of the ""Super-Soldier"" story arc that went absolutely nowehere. On top of this is the ""William the freak baby"" story arc that ended with Scully ditching her and Mulder's child in ""William"", completing the destruction of her character begun in the eighth season, not to mention the idea that Mulder ditched his child and Scully because his life was in danger. How many times has Mulder gotten his butt kicked in the past, without chickening out? On top of the mythology going down the toilet, the ""monster of the week"" episodes struggled to tell a coherent story, let alone something as enjoyable as episodes from seasons past. No amount of extras is going to improve the content of this season. Do yourself a favor and buy one of the other X-Files sets."
3,Season 9 wasn't that bad,"Yet it wasn't the best either. I'm sure like all other fans Mulder was sorely missed. I didn't think the new characters were that bad. And hey, we still had skinner. i don't think alot of the fans gave the new characters much of a chance. I really like Dogget. And Reyes was pretty cool although we only got about a year to get to know her. I'm really looking forward to the ninth season. I hope that there are a bunch of bonus materials."
3,Worth Renting,"The majority of the myth-arc episodes are not of great quality and in my opinion show Mulder and Scully as really out of character - it gets tiresome when they are romantic constantly. Nor did I particularly like the character of Monica Reyes, although Annabeth Gish is a great actress. I did, however, really enjoy some of the MOTW (monster - of - the - week) episodes that had nothing to do with the ongoing supersoldier/alien plot. Daemonicus in particular comes to mind, though I have not yet seen a few of them. Unlike many fans, I loved the character of John Doggett and I actually wish they had delved into his character a bit more before the demise of the series. As a die hard X Phile, I will purchase this set(...)."
3,The Truth....finally,"A great TV show that was allowed to drag on too long. Mulder only appears in the final two hour episode. Scully takes a back seat most of the season. Doggett and Reyes just don't have the chemistry. CGB SpPender, a.k.a ""the smoking man"" reappears towards the end to reveal what Mulder is afraid to speak. I would rather have seen a video of Spender versus having him come off as some sort of mystic. It was poorly done."
1,Beyond Shark Bait,"Justifying this horrendous season by saying ""well, its still better than most TV shows out there."" is like saying ""Gee, it doesn't matter that our President is bad, no-one smart ever runs for president anyway."" Simply put, this season SUCKS. There is no X-Files without Mulder & Scully, period. Chris Carter jumped his shark sometime in season six. Super soldiers? A jesus/alien baby? Puh-leez, even the cheesiest moments of Buffy are better than this pablum. What a horrible way to end a once-fantastic series."
2,Confusion Reigns,I asked continually for the full 7 disc version and I kept getting sent the 5 disc version. This caused me great annoyance and finally I got what I wanted by going out on ebay.
3,The X-Files: THe Complete 9th Season,I had not seen the last few years of the series. This was different than what I expected - but was okay
4,The Truth,"I'll go ahead and say that season 9 is a little underrated. The fact that Mulder maintained a strong presence at the end of season 8 and dissapeared at the season premier of season 9 was a dissapointment, no questions. Cary Elwes appearing as a character is an interesting angle, but a little unrealized as he unfortunately does not really make all that many appearances. Fortunately, we get at least one return to the comedy genre with the episode Improbable. This was something I missed in season 8. I believe this season is a bit of a let-down, but only for those who don't enjoy the X-Files. I think if you're a dedicated fan, you'll still enjoy this season. This DVD does not include the special features like 6,7, and 8 did.Good episodes:Nothing Important Happened Today I & II4-DTrust No 1John DoeProvenance (1)Providence (2)Improbable (feat. Burt Reynolds)Scary MonstersJump the SharkWilliamSunshine DaysThe Truth I & II"
3,Good try... but not great,"There were many interesting X-File cases, but any episode trying to bring back a conspiracy theory and/or Mulder just wasn't that fabulous. The series finale was a means to an end - bringing back past characters both dead and alive."
4,Better than you think,"Everyone hated the last season when it came out because they so wanted Mulder and Scully to return. Yet, when you watch the last season now, years later, they really breathed new life into a show that had lost its edge. The non-conspiracy episodes are MUCH better than they were on the original series."
3,not great but decent.,"Season nine of this show was it's weakest , ok, we all agree on that, but those angry one star reviews should be ignored because this is still the x-files, in any job people move on and others take over that reality and it's the same in tv land so that's the story here. The stories range from great to ok and that's the truth. I would say like any ong running tv shows you get these people who cannot accept others in the main roles and they complain alot , however they do have a point that this season is alot weaker than what came before it, it was a show winding down and the writing and other points were not as great as before, the x-files is one of tv's greatest shows ever and that's a fact, this season should be bought to complete your series run and bought last at that."
3,withering show,"Agent Doggy is the only attraction in the late series . His personality, and , possibly, that of Skinner, do the trick. He came too late to the show, so , the ancient saying that"" the dying rose smells the best"", is not true for this effort."
3,eh - its okay,the last few seasons of this show aren't my favorite (of course...i was a die hard fan from the beginning. my allegiances are with mulder and scully) but naturally i had to get every season. I dont think anyone that is looking to buy this doesn't know what they're getting into.
4,"Finally, the TRUTH!!!","Well the series raised many questions over its run, and in truth, most of them were never answered. But at least some of the more important issues were brought to closure by the end of this season, and now I own it on dvd to watch over and over, without commercial interuption."
3,"It was OK, but where are the Gunmen??","I was a long-time fan of this show, starting back in the second season. Even when I went away to college, my friends and I had ""X-Files"" night. Many of us where dissapointed with how the show evolved in it's latter seasons, so when our fav trio of paraniod hackers got their own spin-off...there was much rejoicing. Please release that one season on DVD!"
4,"An Agonizing decision, but I had to have it.","I agonized many nights on whether to buy this season or not. Needless to say, I had to know what happened to Mulder and Scully. Generally, this season was not as bad as many of the reviews would have you believe. One thing left me wanting, though. Even though the X-Files is rarely about happy endings, I wanted one. I wanted Mulder, Scully and William to finally be together as a family after all they had been though, especially since their own families were decimated over the series. For Scully to give up William felt wrong. Need a movie to fix this."
4,"Not the best, not the worst","This show did what it was intended to do all along, and that's just plain entertain it's audience. Hardcore, and i do mean the hardcore fans who take it WAY too seriously whine about their disappointment, but they will get over it. I love this show for keeping me entertained all of the nine years, albeit with some misses, what the heck was that HUNGRY ep all about? But it was still better than most of the shows out their. This season was no different. I missed Mulder terribly, but knowing that he was there in the end made it worthwile. True fans of the show will love this set just as much as the rest because it is their favorite show, so stop whining. I learned to. :)"
4,Worth It for Huapango Alone!,"After serendipitously hearing Huapango on Sirius, I just had to have it! This CD presents an interesting mix of composers -- some more significant than others -- and other reviewers have addressed the strength of some of these pieces over others. But the joyful ebullience of Huapango is something I find myself turning to time and time again. The last cut on the disc, Huapango alone is worth the effort it took to find it. I would have bought this CD if Huapango had been the only piece on it!"
2,Not for those looking to put injection on older engines.,This book has been advertised as being a guide to swapping TBI and TPI onto older engines. It contains only one 2 page chapter on the subject. The chapter can be summarized as follows - The author feels it cost less to put in a complete new engine. This book does look to be good for those planning to swap the entire engine into an older vehicle.It contains much useful info on that subject.
2,not so invincible...,"my kid is 5 and received this for his birthday. he loves it and wants so bad to wear it, but the mask is very ill-fitting and the web and spider decoration on the gloves is already peeling off. the mask is the most disappointing part. at one setting, the band rests on his ears and the next notch tighter, he cant even get it on his head. if you get this, save the box and receipt in case you have these same problems. maybe the manufacturer will correct the problems if they receive enough returns."
3,Web Slinging Fun,My son received this as a gift for his 4th birthday. Both the mask and gloves work fine. The gloves still have the original batteries in them from 3 months ago. The mask fits well and is adjustable with sturdy velcro. He really enjoys this.
1,My 3 yr old son loves this toy,"Despite the not so raving reviews above, my son loves this toy. We have not had any problems at all. THe original batteries are still in the gloves and the mask may not fit perfectly but it does the trick. We like this so much we are giving it as a gift this Christmas."
3,beware a foreign libretto!,"I'm assuming that Albeniz didn't understand a word of this English libretto. It ranks as just about the worst I've ever encountered. One unintentionally hilarious line has the soprano ask of Merlin ""I pray, grant me to hold your rod..."" meaning his magic wand (of course). I was really disappointed that the octet of countertenor gnomes is so short (no pun intended. They also sound just like the chorus of fairies (ditto-females) that sing in response to them. Too bad. The orchestral music is beautiful, and the performances quite good, but what a waste. There's just no drama here."
2,Disappointing in some cases,"Well, I think this isn't the opera we've waited for so long. I can imagine other operas of which I love to have a recorded version. The presentation is up to Decca's (London) high standards but the recording is only 'good'. The singing, alas, in some cases is very, very ugly. Ms. Henschel is yelling around - when is this lady going to stop? - and Mr. Domingo does his utmost best singing Spenglish.After I while I got bored because the story and the text were so 'old fashioned'. And, hearing Domingo and Alvarez singing English is like hearing Japanese speaking Dutch. Have you heard him (Domingo) singing Wagner? No, well don't try because you get tired.All in all I found this whole enterprise a missed opportunity.1 star for Adventurism and 1 star for presentation."
4,Nice for the price!!!,"The Creative TravelSound is the perfect companion for your laptop or in my case, an iPod. It requires 4-AAA batteries that are not included and will give you about 10 hours of use...that is from my experience. The sound from these speakers is wonderful. The bass and treble is a perfect blend and it includes a button which allows you to activate a type of surround/3D sound. All in all, these speakers are very nice for the price."
4,Excellent Classroom Textbook!,"I was told to bye this book for our classroom text and I thought it would be just another boring textbook, but I was wrong. Not only did this book keep my attention, I learned a lot about the mass media in the process. John Vivian discusses topic matter that is up to date and many can relate to. It shows many view of the mass media industry with realizism that surpasses many. I recommend it to be used in your classroom."
4,good memory,Got here quick. Fit into the computer easily. Boosted performance immediately. What more could you ask for?
1,I guess I should have known,"Paying only $6.99 for a 512mb stick of ram would be too good of deal; well it was, tried everything reseating, running on it's own and so on with the same results PC would not boot because of hardware failure - ram.Avoid cheap deals unless you can find someone out there that has high marks; which usually results in high standards."
1,Blank order,"We ordered a dvd from this place, and tried it on 3 dvd players. It played nothing, so we returned it and a week and 1/2 later we got another one that was similiar in nature, same problem. We have always had good luck ordering off Amazon, this is the first problem we have had. I don't recomend this shop."
3,"Oh, It's Cute....BUT.....","Cute pan. I had this one back in 1993, and I lost the plastic topper that comes with it. The plastic cake topper for this particular pan is Barbie's upper body that is placed on top of the cake, and then decorated right along with the body. If you have only one cake to make....great! Just make sure the party guests eat the cake in your home, or RETURN the topper if they take the cake to their own home because Wilton does NOT sell extra toppers. The pan becomes a total waste if you lose the topper just like I did back in the 90's. The only way to obtain another topper is to spend more money buying a whole new pan."
3,Tamron AF 18-250mm,"I am happy to get a versatile lens by a good company at a decent price. For some reason, some shots come back overexposed and I can see no reason why. I can use the same settings and take the picture again and it will correctly expose the shot. This is the only lens to which I have this occurring & I own 4 other lenses. I am using this on a Canon Rebel. I like all the other features with the lens. It is definitely a basic lens without image stabilization, but why it misinterprets the ttl readings bugs me. Still, I can have the camera in the back seat and be ready for any opportunity to capture a picture wherever I may be."
2,"nice optics, bad implementation","optics are far better that from IS/non IS kit lenses that comes with Cannon XTi. pictures are better, clearer, brighter and so on an so forth. i.e. lens optical qualities are really good. not as good as L series of course but for value/money might be best selection. however there is the big downside: every time you tip the camera downwards, lens retracts! (yes I know there is a lock, but locking it makes lock your zoom as well while you are shooting, and lock is only for static i.e OFF position) which makes it completely useless! so you have to hold it with hand all the time you make pictures...returned it after week of testing, too shame, really liked picture quality."
4,Great lens!,"I am very happy with this lens. I other people's reviews before purchasing and I agree that when fully extended in telephoto auto focus doesn't work very well. But I can live with that. I love the versatility this lens gives me. I took it to the Getty Center and didn't have change lens all day. I was so tired of having to swith from one lense to the other and sometimes, there isn't time to do so. I love this lens and think it a great price as well."
4,Good Value/Quality,"Originally purchased the CCanon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM which I later returned in favor of this Tamron lens. Bought Tamron for increased zoom range. Found Tamron lighter and smaller than Canon, but good quality. Good all around lens. Most of my shooting is outdoors, and lack of Canon IS less of an issue than it may be for other users."
1,Returned it to Amazon before 30days,"I initially liked this lens and it looked like it was going to stay with my Canon 500D. I really liked the compactness and all-in-one portability. But after comparing the picture quality of this lens with my Canon 55-250 IS, the softness in quality was quite noticeable indeed. Like other reviewers, the thing that bothered me as well was the lens creep. I tried the rubber band trick but eventually took it off since it was not nice to look at. But the thing that really made me give up on this lens was the defective lock switch. Even in the Off-position, the lock would only work 30% of the time. I'm afraid I'm going to break that darn thing. Really not worth the hassle, especially with the amount of time and money spent to buy this. My advice is look somewhere else if you don't want to get dissapointed."
3,Tamron 18-250 mm macro lens for Canon cameras,"lens produced good quality pictures, but lock tab to prevent lens from extending when camera is carried is useless after several uses. Spend a little more money and avoid the hassle."
2,They should have paid more attention to detail,"This book is another example of a Cisco Press book that was written in a hurry by a group of people that did not communicate nor did they carefully review their material for errors. Some of the router configuration examples are clearly wrong. The attached CD at times does not reflect the written mateial and asks questions that are not covered in the book! As of May 1, 2003, Cisco has announced that the BSCI 640-901 test (This Book!) is being replaced by a new test - BSCI 642-901. Hopefully the author(s) will correct all of their errors in the next edition for the new test. Good luck on you CCNP/DP Certification"
3,Okay to use but not as your only book,"This book does cover the material however, it is organized somewhat funny, a little difficult to follow and the IPv6 section is very weak. If you are new to these subjects this book is not for you. It is easier if you have years of hands on experience or have read other books first. I used it as a complement with the Doyle and new Cisco Press CCIE book plus my own lab to pass the BSCI in a couple of weeks. The CD test engine is too easy. One tip to pass the BCSI, practice, practice, practice.This book is dated though(2003)compared to BCMSN switching exam which released a new book in early 06 that is excellent.I used Clair's first book back in 2k and it was great but this one is so so. HTH..."
2,"Content good, but poor technical editing wastes your time","I agree with Las Cruces's review. I am only posting because I disagree with his rating of 4 out of 5. I bought the book to help me learn the latest things for my recertification, not to learn how to decode extremely good, but poorly presented material. To be fair, I haven't read the whole book and am now seriously questioning if I will."
4,Required reading,"Studying this book finally enabled me to pass the BSCI. Make no mistake though; this is not a great book. It is poorly organized, it is full of errors (even ones not stated in the errata - I can rattle off quite a few) and basically hard to understand.If you are new to the subject, this is not the book you want to read - go buy the Sybex book. If you have read and understand the Sybex book, and want to pass the exam, read this book. I can not tell you what is on the exam (or Cisco will sue me) but I CAN tell you from experience that there is information on the exam concerning material that is covered in this book and NOT in the Sybex book!!As for those who claim the Sybex book has a better grasp on the concepts, I disagree. Claire Gogh's writing on BGP is hard to wade through, but it is rather obvious that she understands BGP better than the author of the Sybex book."
1,Not Recommended,I ignored the reviews and bought this anyway thinking that the test simulation on the CD would be at least worth it. Wrong! I've always equated Cisco Press to quality books. Somehow this one slipped through...
1,Worst book -- don't buy this --just use cisco.com site,"The way this book is written, the writing style is dull and boring. Author does not how to explain concepts well. Don't waste your time on this boook, more important than the money. my advice: look BSCI exam objective, use [...] documentation --white papers etc. [...] explains every single concept very well, in professional way; interesting to read too. This author is very amateur, her writing style is akin to that of grade-8 kid."
1,Good example how to make simple things complicated,This book is a good example how to make simple things complicated. It seems author don't have any pedagogical knowledge. Book also contains some serious logical errors.
3,Good for review or recertification,"Information are thrown away in this book without a solid hierarchy. For example, compare the IS-IS chapters with another book (like Ciscopress 2nd edition Paquet, Teare-i would advise that book for 1st timers): Clare's book starts by throwing definitions all over, without explaining the OSI model and introducing IS-IS in a ""smooth"" way. The ""backbone"" concept is not clealry explained. Etc.Hope this helps"
3,On the fence for this one.,"This book has plenty of information. It could serve better as reference book while working in the real world, which is preventing me from returning it.Since this book is a certification guide specifically for the BSCI, it falls short. It should have included 3 router lab setups for each topic. It does show configuration examples, however they are only for 1 or 2 routers displayed in the figures. This is a huge disapointment.A typo has already been identified on the Networking Professional website on Policy-based routing, and even a refernce to the number 642-801, was typed as 640-801.The BSCI also requires to identify the steps to confiure a router for NAT with overlaod, static translations, and route maps. The NAT section of this book does not provide configuration examples. Another disapointment."
4,Best Book for the 640-901 Exam,"This was a very good book in general. There were some typos. I originally had the Todd Lammle BSCI book but found it did not map to the test objectives very well. My associate had the book and after reviewing it I bought a copy. I used this book, the Cisco BSCN Supplement for IS-IS, Todd Lammle's RouterSim and few resources from the Cisco website to study for the exam. I passed the exam and feel the book sufficiently covered the material on the exam. The 640-901 exam is being replaced by the 642-801 exam. The new exams look like they are focused more on actual configuration and applying concepts rather than the concepts themselves. Good luck in your certification endeavors!"
5,"Big WOW Factor, Compact and FUN to use!","This camera rocks! It is so small and fits in your pocket or around your neck (has a strap built in). This camera is small, but still easy to hold and take great pictures.It has auto red eye reduction and a built in flash. The flash thinks for you! No need to mess with turning it on or off or wondering if you should use it in certain lighting conditions.At this price point, you get alot of power in such a little device. The camera is APS, so it has two different image sizes you can use. APS film is easy to use too because you can only put it in one right way, believe me, you can't mess this up! A child can do this! ;-)I highly recommend this camera to a beginner, a gift for a young person, or just the casual photographer. I normally use high res. digital cameras, but this one is great to pop in your pocket and go have some fun!It even comes with a full roll of film and a battery! Normally you just get a roll of 15 shots but you get a full roll in this one!"
3,Wish I knew if it worked,"Bought this for my Mother (had it shipped direct to her). She couldn't get it to work so she sent it to me. Turns out the battery was completely dead (probably since the unit was over 4 years old, even though still new in box).Bought a new battery, still didn't work. Too late to return it to the seller, so it went in the trash."
3,Good puzzle book for kids,I bought this book for my daughter and she loves it. It is a great item that can be tossed in a backpack for long bus rides or family outtings. Good book! Keeps the brain working.
4,Another go to product from McCormick,"I love to use herbs and spices when I cook. With veggies, we often refer to the trinity--onion, celery, and carrots (mirepoix). With herbs? My trinity is basil, thyme, and oregano. I love using the three of those together.The Gourmet Collection version is tasty. Fresh thyme is tastier, of course, but for a product like this--already prepared--you would do well trying this. I have been using this for years and it is a dependable product for taste enhancement.Thus, I would recommend this if you don't have access to fresh thyme."
2,Be aware of not clear package description .,In time of purchase was picture with two mounts in one package what indicate in purchase quantity place.But arrived only one mount (Who changing one mount or one strut ???)I left feeling that I was cheated and confuse with this purchase.It has to be more clear description of item.I did not find in description how many mounts in package.
5,kyb strut mount,I needed strut mounts to go with an all around restoration of a 200 vw beetle. All struts and shocks were replaced with kyb products and everything is of great quality.I now have a 2000 lifted new beetle tdi with kyb suspension and a fresh paint job
5,Greatest Chill Compilation,Buy it and let it play. When I bought it it was more expensive and still worth it.
5,How to revive a dried out pastel gel pen,"I am a commercial artist who uses pastel gel pens a lot. This product, Sakura 38176 10-piece Gelly Roll Assorted Colors, is a popular example. The downside of pastel gel pens is that they quit working after a rather short period of time. Well, I am excited to report that here is an answer to this problem!Here's how: (1) Heat some water to simmer in a large diameter frying pan (fill about 1/4 the pan). (2) Place your dry pens in a cake pan, and float the cake pan in the simmering water. (3) If you have one, put a lid over the frying pan. No lid? Not a problem. (4) Let pens warm up for around 10-15 minutes, then take them out of the frying pan. (5) Choose a pen to experiment and make some scribble circles on paper. You should be rewarded with a flow of pastel ink! That's it. Good luck to you."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"They shipped these so quick, I couldn't believe they got here so fast. However, I was pretty disappointed in the overall performance of the ink's reactivity to UV light. Only 3 of the markers really ""shine"" under UV. The rest you would be hard pressed to say they had any reactivity at all."
3,color spreads out unevenly.,colors run out of the pens and can get quite messy. But love the colors. Ink needs to be thicker.
4,No-glow :l,"I really like these pens :) they write well and I love the neon colors, but when i tested the ink under my blacklight, (not a cheapie one either) I didn't see the ink glowing at all...as much as it would have been cool, I don't really care. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase :)"
2,"Jersey Blue - Informative, but needs work.","I find Dr. Gillette's book to be very informative of the state of New Jersey during the Civil War period. However the book, comparing them to the likes of James McPherson's Battle Cry For Freedom, his book isn't very exciting, it is that there seems to be no enthusiasm about anything. The book's writing style is what needs work, that it to any average reader would find the book boring and dry. If there was something to grab one's attention or more excitement in the writing style it would be a better book."
4,Works well as a Common Mode Choke,"I'm using 2 of these units as ""common mode chokes"" on the coax feelines from my HF ham radio rig to the antenna. I'm using a transmitter that outputs approx. 100 watts from 160M (1.8 mHz) to 10M (30 mHz). Before installing the ferrites I had some issues with RF on the outside of the coax getting into the control line cables and other wiring in the ham shack. Installation of these ferrites eliminated the problem.The size of the inside bore of these units is perfect for RG-8 & LMR-400 50 ohm coax cable, and the small plastic barbs on the cover grab onto the outer cover of the coax just enough to hold it in place without penetrating the cover. BTW, one of them is outside where the coax enters the shack and no problems so far (though I did wrap that one with duct tape to keep the rain & snow out).Overall, good product, a fair price & they work - what more can one aks for?"
2,"I got what I expected, but not what I'd hoped for...","The Amazon review is, unfortunately, very accurate on this title. I was very intersted in the first half of the DVD, even though it felt like an ad for Coren's book, but I was truly disgusted with the ""making of"" nonsense that followed. We are guided through the process of design and creation of Tolkien-esque characters for the production of....THIS VIDEO. That's all it was. It would have been nice if they had even portrayed the FAKE characters correctly, but thier lawyers were too wise for that. The only reference to the real movie was by a comic-store-guy expecting a jump in bussiness. About 40% of the info is watchable, don't bother with the rest."
1,Don't waste your money,"This video spends more time showing people designing costumes for an unidentified production of LOTR than time on Tolkien himself. The most ludicrous thing is the portion discussing the paintings of the Brothers Hildebrandt while showing totally unrelated artwork. The people who put this video together should have, at least, identified the artwork while acknowledging that they had no permission to show the actual Hildebrandt paintings. Instead it gives a false impression that the artwork being shown was by the Hildebrandts. Also the dramatic recreations featuring a man who looked nothing like Tolkien were not labeled as recreations and may be misconstrued by people with less knowledge of Tolkien. Almost a total waste."
2,Very disappointing,"I saw this on the web through a vendor I will not name here so as not to offend Amazon. I would never buy this, as I still regret my wasted time. Most abhorrent was the time wasted showing some cosmetician's version of some characters from the book, and it didn't even make much of an effort there. I know a group of high school students who made a fan film with better make-up and costuming than this supposed documentary. In short, this was very disappointing."
3,"I liked it, what can I say?","With all the hype around the films it's neat to see the impact that Tolkien's books have had on the world. I think that's what makes this documentary most interesting. I read the other amazon review commenting on the fake portrayal of characters. Not sure if I agree since Tolkien left so much of his fictional work to the imagination of his readers, they made an interpretation, just like Peter Jackson did. I don't think either is right personally but that's the beauty of imagination. Anyways the Doc has some cool stuff in it, I think they could have made it a little shorter since some of the interviews are more interesting than others. I think it's worth a look."
2,Poorly designed,"There are two major design flaws with this thermometer. You can clearly see both of these flaws in the picture of this product.The first is that the cap at the top of the thermometer is made of plastic. It melted in the middle of my candy making when the cap touched the pot. I was stirring the candy with one hand and desperately trying to get hold of a potholder to hold up the thermometer and keep the melted cap out of my candy with the other hand.Second, the clip has a knob on it but the knob is at the top of the clip instead of the bottom, making it nearly impossible to open the clip up to reposition the thermometer in the middle of cooking."
2,Not that great,"Ok- I have been through two of these in the past 3 years. And I have broken them both. They crack at the bottom near the tip. The readings are hard to read, and it is quite difficult the keep the thing in and on the pan! Now that my latest one broke, I am looking for digital and great quality, not price!"
1,Cracked after one use,"This thermometer cracked in two places near the bottom and filled with condensation after only one use. I was extremely careful not to allow the tip to touch the bottom of the pot, so there was no reason for it to crack. The clip is poorly designed and is nearly impossible to open to attach to the side of a pot. Once I finally got the clip open and the thermometer secured to the pot it began to slide upwards (from the force of the clip) until it finally came off entirely. I suppose I could have found a jar grip or something to place between the clip and the pot to prevent slippage, but I shouldn't need to do that."
5,Just what I needed,"The passenger side mirror on my 2002 Pontiac Sunfire had a mishap and needed to be replaced. This was a perfect replacement, easy to install. Saved a ton of money by doing it myself!"
2,Not the product I ordered,I ordered on bottle of Cali Tarocco Shampoo and on bottle of the Cali Conditioner and was sent two bottles of the shampoo.
4,OK oldish recording...OK sound,"The disc contains the most essential Sibelius, to get a real pictureof the composer. The performances are not bad at all. However, thereare a dozen complete Sibelius cycles and you can get them for under 25dollars new. So this older recording is worth a look for a good price.The Karelia suite is a spirited performance."
5,A great Christmas present,"If you want a great CD for Xmas, pick up ""Starvation Box"", but ""Don't Stand Still"", ""U Gotta Move"", so ""Shake"" your ""Snake Hips"" down to the ""Shotgun Shack"", near ""Radio Mojo"" and get this CD. You won't be feeling ""Deja Blue"" either ""Little Boy Blue"", you'll be ""Prayin' For Rain""!! If Santa doesn't bring it to you, you'll ""Blame It On Love"", but ""Love Ain't Enough"", so, if you don't get this record soon, you'll have a bad case of ""Lonesome Dog Blues"". Ron Redden"
1,ick!,"I bought this by accident, instead of the light brown rice bread. I was wondering why my son wasn't eating his cinnamon toast after a teeny bite....only then I realized it was a different bread. I tried it myself and it's not edible when not toasted, and it's a rock hard, cardboard texture when it is toasted. The light brown rice bread is sooo much better."
2,Ener-G Brown Rice Loaf,I usually get light brown rice bread by Ener-G and I just love it. I accidently bought the brown rice loaf and blah I hated it. I did not like the taste and it did not toast well.
1,Terrible,Upon opening the loaf the bread was not soft at all. I had to microwave it and warm up the bread to soften it. My son only ate a whole slice after I toasted it and put jelly on it. I do not recommend buying. i will continue to try others.
1,Good if you like the taste of cardboard,"I got this for my son who is on a gluten free diet. I gave him 1 slice bread, he tasted it and gave it back to me. I thought he was being picky but when I tasted it, it was so so bland and felt and tasted like cardboard. Yuck, not a fan of the cardboard taste. $5.00 down the drain.. oh well."
1,Expired,"If you buy from Amazon, make sure you check the dates. I bought this bread in September, and it was already expired on JUL 23. Scary!!"
1,"Awful, awful bread!","Oh my gosh this bread is awful! We've gotten gluten free breads before that were decent, especially when heated, but this is awful!!!! Even the dog won't touch it! Try the tapioca or the light brown rice loaf-much better!"
1,SO Dry,"If you would like something with a texture similar to regular (non gluten free) bread, do NOT buy this. As others described, it is so very dry. I'm not sure about the process of making this bread, but it seems like I'm eating uncooked rice that has been ground up very fine and mixed with a binding agent. The flavor is very bland too.I've looked at a few different stores in my area, and so far my favorite gluten-free brand is Udi's from Tom Thumb or Kroger. The versions I found weren't made with rice, but they do have gluten-free plus wheat-free. It isn't as moist as non-gluten-free bread, but when you lightly toast it with a little butter, it is so good! My kids loved it when they first tried it, so I didn't have worry about trying to get them used to it. I'm still not sure how it will fair used for sandwiches, but at least it tastes better and isn't near as dry as this ""brown rice loaf""."
2,The Price quoted is too expensive.,"This price on this product appears to have gone up by 50% on amazon in about 3 months. Other retailers are selling it for less, so check other merchants before you buy!"
3,Great for doing 4 slabs of ribs,"It was a little pricey, but I went for it because this is a must for doing 4 slabs and it will fit on a 22-1/2"" Weber. However, this product does indeed stick. It is black coated, which may make it worse as far as sticking is concerned. I did three slabs of ribs the first time I used it and they really stuck to the rack. I had to take great care in getting the ribs unstuck from the rack and prying them out. Cleanup was not easy, I ended up letting the rack soak in water for an hour before resuming cleanup with steel wool pads. Spraying it with non-stick may help the next time I use it. This rack is heavy duty and well constructed (not flimsy like some of them are), my only issue is the sticking part, and it may be better next time using non-stick spray before grilling."
2,Rib Rack,I have three of these racks. They are very functional for smoking large slabs of ribs. Cleaning is a bit difficult. Handle did break on one rib rack after first usage.
5,great for cooking perfect ribs,My wife ate the ribs I made and said they were cooked perfectly. It made it easy to baste and sauce them.
3,Works well but cleanup....Yikes!,"I really like the shape of this rack as it accommodates the larger pork spare ribs, which I really like. It provides plenty of space between the racks, assuring that smoke flavor will permeate and that you can easily mop the ribs if you so desire.That said, cleanup is a bear!! The previous reviewer asserted that cleanup is easy....I beg to differ. The rack has a lot of wires and they are not at all easy to scrub. This may be advertised as 'Non-Stick' but several hours in a smoker will bake on a lot of 'gunk'. Even after soaking, the 'stuff' was still present. I finally gave up and sprayed it with oven cleaner. That was an improvement but I don't know how this will impact the rack over the long run. I am not sure that I will be using this accessory again."
2,A Pain,"If you baste your ribs when smoking them, this is not a good choice. It has way too many wires. It is a cleaning nightmare - takes up to an hour to clean after smoking ribs for several hours.Also, once Baby Backed Ribs are smoked in this to the point that they are ""fall-off-the-bone-tender"", they are very, very difficult to remove from the rack. Because there are so many wires that are too close together, the ribs cannot be removed vertically or horizontally from this rack after they are done. The curved ribs get caught below the top wires and cannot be removed. It is way over-engineered to a fault making smoking ribs a real chore.I have tried three different non-stick sprays on this rack prior to using it to no avail. I have stopped using it for Baby-Back-Ribs after at least a dozen uses."
5,Look no further for rib racks...,"I enjoyed the first one so much that it was a no-brainer when I needed a second rib rack. There's a lot to like here, from the handles on the end, to the easy clean-up. If you're in the market for rib racks, I highly recommend that you give these a try."
4,All around useful.,"This product really does the job it is intended for. It is well made and strong making it easy to move about even completely full. Semi easy cleanup, the products coating cleans easy but there are a lot of surface areas when you come down to it. It did give me much more room in my smoker for other items and that's what I was trying to accomplish."
5,Well built.,Have not used yet. Item is strong and should support the heaviest of ribs. Also appears easy to clean.
5,Works great!,It Works great and the ribs are cooked evenly. I Love this product! I would definitely recommend this rib rack to anyone.
3,5 stars for performance - 1 star for cleaning,"This is a very large, heavy duty, rib rack. It's height does well with spare ribs larger size. But the clean up is very difficult. I guess you could put it in the dishwasher, never tried. I mainly cook baby back ribs so I don't need such a tall rib rack. Because of the difficulty in cleaning I would not buy this again. I am not exaggerating. It's like cleaning a maze."
2,Impossible to Clean,"This rack was effective, but the structure of the rack is too complicated and that makes it impossible to clean. There are too many cross ""bars"" and supports. I have used it for a year on my weber smoky mountain, but I finally got tired of trying to clean it and threw it away"
1,Non stick is not true,Non stick..........what a joke. It is a nightmare to clean the rack after. Would not buy again. After a few uses the non stick coating came off at many places.
5,"Incredible, well-designed rack","Very sturdy construction, with lots of support for meats(those cross-members in the middle are welded to the top layer, so you have six support rods elevated almost an inch to let the fats drip down and not touch the ribs.Finish is baked-on enamel. Poor packaging - it is shipped in thin polybag. Do not order this along with cast iron ""stuff"" or the rack WILL get scratched (ask me how do I know :( )Like any sturdy convoluted thing, will be a bear to clean unless soaked in the DEEP sink with nylon brush. Personally, I'll run it through the dishwasher. Then, again, just like a grilling rack it does not have to be spotless :)Five stars for the rack, one star for the packaging except that I do not know whether Amazon repackaged the item."
3,Not for 4 FULL slabs of Spareribs,"Nicely made. To clean, soak it in hot water with dishwasher detergent, then clean wih a brush. Sparkles after that. Only problem is the first time I used it I put 4 full slabs of pork ribs (not baby back ribs) in it and they really didn't get thoroughly cooked. Perhaps for two full racks it will be OK. I expect so, but we'll have to see."
3,Review,Hard to use in a small oven (barely any room for a drip pan) and hard to put BBQ sauce on while in the rack. Very hard to clean even though it is non-stick. Ran it through the dishwasher twice and there is still with stuff still on there - gave up.
1,Don't buy!,"I was given this computer for college 3 years ago. It didn't give me any trouble for the first 2 years, but after that the trouble came: I had to replace the whole hard drive and just a month ago, the connection between the monitor and the computer worsened because of opening and closing the top. Also, the computer's fan makes a LOT of noise whenever you use for more than 10 minutes."
4,Quiet and Calm,"Levertov's poems in Breathing the Water don't make you want to go out, run and jump for joy or sorrow. Rather, they tug intellegently at the heart and consciousness. Take the poem ""Making Peace."" The first line says ""A voice from the dark called out, 'The poets must give us imagination of peace'. What a wonderful way of saying what she has to say. Her account of Ernest Chausson's death was imaginative and made me want to inquire further. I didn't find the poetry to be so wonderful, that I wanted to give this slim volume a ""5,"" but I liked them, all of them, so it deserves a ""4"" in my humble opinion."
2,Poor Sizing and Locking Tabs Break Easily,"I went to ""easily snap"" onto my power cable on my tv and the 2 locking tabs broke off instantly. (you can see them in the item picture) Even without much force, these things are fragile. I ended up wrapping it on there with electrical tape. Still didn't solve my noise problem but I don't think it's this products fault. However, 1/4"" should be 1/4"". The inside diameter seems just a hair smaller than 1/4"", enough to be an issue. Customers may want to purchase the 3/8"" size instead to be safe."
2,Inaccurate description,"Seems well made enough (how tricky is it to make a ferrite collar?), but the actual inside diameter is less than 1/4"", so I couldn't use them because they wouldn't close around my cords. I contacted the seller and they sent replacements, but they were the exact same thing. If you don't need the full 1/4"", you should be fine. If you do, look elsewhere.Edit: I've been able to use some of these on some cheap HDMI cables I bought, so that's cool."
2,Useless for a USB cable,"The 1/4"" aperture is much larger than a usb cable, so this product is entirely ineffective at suppressing noise on anything using a usb cable. I got it for aCAD U1 USB Dynamic Recording Microphone, and it was a waste of money."
1,A waste,"I bought a new iPhone and for some reason when I put it near my computer speakers, it makes an awful loud buzzing noise. I found this product, which was supposed to eliminate that noise by attaching it to my computer power cord. I tried it on my computer power cord, my speaker power cord, my usb power cord, nothing kept the noise from returning. Unfortunately, this product did not do what it was supposed to."
2,You get what you pay for,"I received my mules today. I would return them if the postage would not cost as much as the shoes. They do run large, I normally wear a 10 wide, or an 11 medium, so I ordered the extra large. When I have these on, I look like I am playing dress up in my ""mommie's shoes"". There is at least an inch or more of the foot bed sticking out at the back of my heel. Also, some of the knots that hold the sequins to the mesh upper, quickly rubbed sore spots on my feet. The shoes are plenty wide, so it was not a matter of them being too tight across, just painful little knots of thread digging into my foot. They are kind of cute, but not well constructed. I would not recommend these."
4,Good Piece,A group of the somehow-linked-with-space-and-time-before-offending young Brits does a community service. A sexually charged set of episodes differs fromShamelessandThe Inbetweenersby a mix of superstitious with simply criminal while local social engineering depicted lead so far to a tragic end of this First Season.A four star mark is because murders covered with excuse of special circumstances and bad characters of victims were murders anyway.
5,Excellent,"This show is amazing, must see for everyone, maybe not kids. Nathan will make you literally laugh out loud guarantee."
1,The death of good society!,This series is a perfect example of why people disrespect authority. The social workers is made into a psychopath. Criminals are shown as being good. Every 2 seconds there's an inappropriate sexual reference. Don't watch this if you want to maintain a healthy mental state. I deleted from my library and you should to.Signed ?
4,"Clever little show about group of messed up teens that gain ""super powers""",Warning it is only 8 episodes long or was it 7? Either way short season but you will quickly fall in love with these social rejects as they learn to control and use their powers. While trying to keep their dark secert continue to deal normal and abnormal events in life after 'the strom' (strom that gave them and others powers)
5,AMAZING!,"Misfits is a great TV series...wonderfully done in my opinion. I am not one to usually do reviews, so I am @ a lose as to what else I could say about it other than 'MUST SEE!'"
5,Misfits series,"You will love 'Misfits'. My friend introduced me to the show last year(2010) and I had to go online and find all the 13 episodes (they are on season 3 right now). I had been looking for a place to buy the episodes and amazon finally has them up, but they are selling them as if they recently got released-which is not entirely true.That said, from the first line to the last twitch, you will admire their acting.Kelly (character) is especially wonderful.You might not like it at first(which is insane)but interestingly, I didn't like it at first and then i tried it once more and that's when I had to go on an online hunt for the episodes.By the way, if you like this show, may I suggest 'The Inbetweeners' and 'Skins' UK (All originals)"
4,Misfits - Season 1,"Great series! Totally satisfied with the DVD content and quality. Also, this purchase came with a online code for a free Misfits t-shirt. The t-shirt is a quality product as well. Can't wait until I can get the second season!Misfits Season OneIf you haven't seen any of the episodes, it is highly recommended viewing. The series is very fresh in content, very unpredictable and believable, and extremely entertaining!"
5,Great TV Show,"First episode was meh, then it got really good starting from the second episode and I couldn't stop watching. Pulled an all-nighter watching this, and right now it's 8:50AM and I haven't slept since yesterday. Worth it."
5,One of the best British shows out there.,"I've never laughed so much in my entire life. This show is amazing. I've re-watched it a few times, and it is hilarious every time. Highly recommend it, but be warned...it's crude."
1,Sloppy!,"This book is conceived and written in a sloppy manner. Prashad sets up straw men and then proceeds to demolish them, which may be fine to score debating points but is unhelpful in understanding contemporary society."
1,Nice try!,"This is a nice try for a good quality book. It is neither updated for the past 5 years, nor it offers something more than good tips on cover letter and resume writing. I doubt that anyone can defeat the severe competition for any cruise ship job having only this as foundation and advice.I have also bought Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days and if I have to compare them it's just like Ph.D thesis and pupil's notebook with tips and tidbits of basic information. I followed The L.A.S.E.R Strategy for Next Generation Applying and got a job in 10 days as an Engineer onboard of Royal Caribbean Cruises. That's why if you really want a cruise ship employment at least you will need the current addresses of the cruise lines in order your application to reach them. Does the author care that the ones in his book are 5 years old? NO! Will you rely on him for the best possible advice and strategies on getting a cruise ship job?"
3,Mr. Hines is an expert- but book is old- year 2000,I bought the book by Miller because I wanted to give my granddaughter the newest information - I bought new 2004 How to get a job with acruise line by Miller.
1,Terrible product,Basement flooded when this product malfunctioned. The only time it worked was when we tested it. A complete waste of money.
1,Pure junk,This pump had the same problem twice in two years. It would start the pump with no water in the sump. So I had to turn the unit off to avoid damage to it. Took it back for a replacement and it did the same thing in a few months. Also could never depend on what the lights were telling me on the panel. It went to the spring junk cleanup which is the best place for it. We have had a lot of rain this year and a power outage during one. Glad I paid the extra amount and got a water powered backup pump that actually works.
1,Don't Buy,"When I need Ace in the hole to work it didn't. The pump did not start. My basement was covered in water. What was the point. Save your money. The only purpose of Ace in the Hole is to work in a power outage, and it didn't. I contacted Simer using the email function on their web site, and they ignored it. Bad Product, Bad Service."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I have had this product for over 12 years. I have had to replace the pump twice when it failed just sitting (not being used). The only time in the last dozen years the we actually had a power failure and I needed the pump, it worked and saved my basement (the family was out of town). But you need to test the pump regularly to be certain that it is working. The battery charger and pump control seem to work well. The in-use buzzer is very week."
1,"Pump never kicke in as promised, basement was flooded.","This pump is waste of time, do not buy this pump. Pump never worked as promised, our basement was flooded. Pump was only three years old, I always did my monthly test."
5,A great starter book for High School,"Great book that summarizes ICT related information for High School computer courses.Useful as a written resource for both students and teachers, and for teachers trying to help students look for resources beyond Wikipedia...Basic information only, but covers a lot of ground. The best 'beginners' textbook that I have come across and used."
3,Good Primer,"This book is a good primer or intro, as it is marketed. My only problem with it is that it is heavy on large pictures, and limited on true text."
4,The best intro to Computers book I have seen.,"I teach an introduction to Computers class at a community college. When they decided to switch to this for the textbook, my response was ""Hey, they won't need a teacher anymore!"" I spent a lot of time with the other textbooks correcting mistakes. This book was obviously written by experienced people in the computer field. I would redo the Internet chapter somewhat, but it is better than any others I've seen."
4,Discovering Computers 2007,This book arrived in perfect condition but a couple of days later than I thought. I am so glad I took the class in 2008 because the book changed in 2009.
5,Excellent Service!,"I needed this book in a hurry, so when I contacted the seller, they understood my situation and express mailed it to me just in time for me to start my new class. Thanks for the exellent response time!"
3,Technology Education,"This is an interesting book to start your knowledge on the Technology field. However, in comparison with other sources(i.e. The Hardware Bible) it does not have the broadness oncertain subjects.Overall this title is excellent when you want to start in the technology of communications."
1,I want my day back,"I couldn't put it down, but I hated myself for reading it. All formula, way too pat. Characters are one dimensional with no development. It reads like the plot of a tv movie. If you like that sort of thing, go for it."
4,Brown Rice Snaps,"Amazon tells me that Unsalted Sesame Brown Rice Snaps are no longer available, so I'm trying Brown Rice Snaps, Unsalted Plain with Organic Brown Rice. Unsalted and gluten free are requirements and having them made with organic brown rice is definitely a plus, but I miss the sesame seed addition from the originals. They are not shipping well, however, as a lot of the crackers in the outside packages arrive broken. As I am not making a presentation with them but just consuming them at home, this isn't a big deal. If they were intended for a public offering, only part of them would qualify. They're crunchier than the Sesame crackers, which were quite crunchy enough themselves. I will continue to order them unless the Sesame Crackers reappear; then I will go back to the sesames."
3,Not just brown rice,"I thought the crackers were made from whole grain brown rice and nothing else. I noticed in the ingredient list that it's actually made from %80 brown rice flour and %20 WHITE rice flour. I avoid white rice because it is nutritionally void. I've never had a bad reaction from eating brown rice. I ate these rice snaps and experienced pain in my teeth and gums the next day. I don't regularly eat sweet foods, but when I do I get the same type of reaction. I will not buy these ""brown rice"" snaps again."
4,brown rice crackers,"well, be nice if they had brown rice crackers with sea veggies to give them a more salty flavor....or at least use sea salt. but couldn't find those. so...these are thin and crunchy and tasty and gluten free and reasonable enough price."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great backpack. I use it all the time and not only to carry tennis equipment and clothing.It's roomy without being too big, the compartments are well designed and it fits really comfortable on my back.Quality is impecable. This is definitely a five stars product."
5,"Not in colour, but still so funny!","A Garfield comic.Garfield is in bedJON:Garfield, GARFIELDGARFIELD:i'm not in right now, if you'd care to leave a messege, wait for the tone.By the way this is so funny!Now what are you waiting for?Drop everything."
5,"Wow, I have it again!!!","I got into Queensryche right before I caught them opening up for Metallica in '88. I burned through 10 copies of Operation Mindcrime in the ensuing years and this video truly captures the show that I saw live back then (and, luckily again in about '05). I still get goosebumps watching it.HIGHLY recommended."
4,Just what I been waiting for.,I had been waiting for a while for LiveCrime to come out on DVD. I am very impressed by the quality and 5.1 surround sound. the DVD played in the 5.1 mode has a lot more bottom end(a little too much)then the VHS version does. That is the only reason I gave it 4 in stead of 5 stars.
5,Where's the Blu-Ray?,The ONLY musically related DVD I can watch over and over... and I can only ask... Where's the Blu-Ray?
5,"I was there that night in Madison, Wisconsin...","This DVD sure brought back fond memories of the best concert I have ever seen - and I have seen numerous concerts over the years. I was one of the 10,000 or so that can actually say I was there the night in Madison when it was filmed, and am glad I was. I had purchased the VHS version upon release, but that since has gone the way of the VCR itself. The ONLY disappointing thing I had with the DVD version is that there was no booklet included that acted as a ""program"" for the production, unlike the original VHS version. Otherwise...it was all that I expected - and remembered!"
2,Ridiculous performance,"I could not believe how badly Sargent conducted the Rossini overtures. Since they make up a large part of the set, it was a complete waste of a cd. He sounds like he must have been asleep during the performance. Rossini commands a bright, crisp tempo but Sargent and his orchestra did not interpret it that way at all. Don't waste your money on this one Get the Chailly/Nat'l. Phil. recording for it's beautiful interpretation."
5,Cool Song,"I dont have the CD, but this song rules! Check it out on the radio. It's like Papa Roach 5X better!"
2,Vague,"Contains errors and non-specifics similiar to the program. If you are buying it because you are just getting into Baan, you will be overwhelmed. If you are buying it to get the most out of your present Baan system, you will be underwhelmed by this book. Save your money."
1,This is a bad copy of the on-line help-texts ...,"This book is nothing more than a bad compilation of the 'famous' Baan help-texts, even with errors and missing parts :-("
3,Good Refeference,"I found the the book to be a good introduction to the Baan ERP application. There are some areas that I found to be weak, DEM is not quite as straightforward as the text implies and the Tools section is a little generic. I was concerned that there is no mention of the Product Configurator at all, this is a shame, as it it a very powerful tool for manufacturing companies, especialy those who 'Make to Order'. Having said that, I have implemented Baan IV and parts of Triton 2.2 and would recommend this book to everyone involved in a Baan IV implementation."
2,Not enough concept to be too useful,"There are session shots & field descriptions of many sessions, but if you are interested in finding out how the modules work, you will not find this book to be too helpful. I found after buying it that I rarely open it at all."
4,Useful reference tool,"A concise, detailed attempt to deliver everything under one roof. Whilst it is by no means complete, it is a good starting point for Baan users and implementers."
1,Very Basic Reference-Nothing to do with implementing,I found this book to be a very basic reference. It covers mostly session captures and data field definitions. If you are looking for expanded detail on topics you are out of luck. And it has very little to do with actually implementing Baan IV at all.
5,NSYNC does it again!!!,"Well to put it plainly, this DVD rocked. I saw this concert in Chicago from the 16th row from the stage, and I think it was an awesome concert. They really made it look great on the DVD. The extra stuff on the DVD was really cool too. It was more of a behind the scenes look, and I'm not sure if that is on the VHS as well. All in all, NSYNC fan or not, you will at least think this as good entertainment, if the music is not your thing (even though that rocks too!) You will be very satisfied if you buy it!!!"
5,This video will ROCK!,"My Best friend and I went to a PopOddesy concert in June and it rocked! The Guys where very energtic and made the crowd have a blast! The songs where amazing and thier voices blew me away! Some of the songs they sung where: Pop, God must Have Spent, I want You Back, I gonna Be Me (1,2,3, to the 4 remix) The game is Over, celbrity, Girlfriend, The Two of us, Gone, Up against the Wall, Bye, Bye, Bye Space cowboys and many many more! If the live show rocked, then I KNOW this video will too!!"
2,whats wrong with the director,"the directing sucks , the director keep taking close shots and you cant see anything , i mean nsync depends on group dancing , we have to see them all dancing , not only one of them danicng , MSG was really beeter than this one , you can see everything on the stage and enjoy the boys dancing together.dont buy it .. waste of money"
5,Pop Odyssey Live was Live!!!!,"I live in New Orleans, so i kow how the concert went. And when i saw it was amazing it was. Just imaging it being on tape is even better. They were just incredible up on stage. It was the best concert every. They even played my favorite song ""Fallin"", it was writting by Chris himself. You guys have to listen to it. Pop Odyssey was the best tour ever."
1,Hated IT!!!!,"No Strings Attatched was a bigger, better explosion of Pop than this DUD!!! Don't waste your money on the lip singing boy band that used to be great Pop."
5,Yummy Boys,I love N'Sync! Does it really matter that I'm 25 and shouldn't love boy bands anymore? Nah! Watching this video makes you feel as though you are on stage with the guys while they are performing. It's got a bunch of great songs and of course great dance moves. It's a must have for any N'Sync fan.
5,A Must for All Nsync Fans!,"I bought this the week it came out and if you have or haven't been to an nsync show, this is a great starter!! The music is amazing, the guys have to much engery and it feels as if you are a part of the show! Even if you don't like Nsync, you have to admit that they work very hard for their fans and the most realistic and down to earth guys. This is great for all ages and the guys rock! If you're going to the Tour this spring, it's a great starter."
3,sound quality is subpar,"the visuals were fantastic. unfortunately, their voices sounded processed and robotic. i saw them in concert, and they certainly sounded better live."
4,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"Ok, so we all saw the show of 2001 and NSYNC does the next best thing....BRINGS IT HOME TO VIDEO AND DVD. My only problem. I saw the show twice and luckily remember a lot. The disappointing part of it was that alot of the video clips between the songs that you may remember are cut off a bit,(to save time I guess) which really bummed me out. Also, I remember the guys putting a little more ""dirty"" into the pop and it seems toned down and a lot of the ""nasty"" moves were omitted. BUMMER. lol. But it is a GREAT keepsake for fans and none the less, and AMAZING show. I just wish they will put the ""CELEBRITY TOUR"" on video, cause that one BLEW POPODYSSEY out of the water! Hope this helps!"
3,Front Row Seat,"*NSYNC - PopOdyssey Live is a larger than life concert! I never thought that the group would do a show bigger than their ""No Strings Attached"" tour, but they did. PopOdyssey is by far the biggest show they've done to date and the viewer gets to see everything up close and personal.I think the highlight of the show is Justin Timberlake's performance of ""Gone."" He really shows off his vocal talents and makes the each audience member feel as though he's singing to her.Overall, the group did a good job and put on an exciting show for its fans. If you're in the mood a lot of singing, dancing, pyro, and special effects, this is the concert for you!"
5,Great DVD!,I just love this DVD! It has everything from the concert and more! It has interviews and info. from behind the scenes. If you watch the band history you will see the first video that they showed in the actual concerts during the PopOdyssey tour.This is one DVD or VHS you will not regret getting. *NSYNC is great! ...
1,Normally I would love this.,"These type of games I normally love to death but this one's controls, horrid game play, cheap enemies and beat em up style I do not care for what so ever, this is a very poor game."
1,Which size is this holster???,If you don't tell me which size this is how do I know if it will fit my gun?Is this a size 3?Is the Bianchi part number for this holster 15254?This model Bianchi Black Widow Model 5 holster can fit any number of guns depending upon which size it is.I can't buy it if you don't give me enough information...
1,Disappointing,"I have several recordings of these works -- I'm always looking for a ""best"" performance. This isn't it. Put simply, the recording and performance are both thin and ancient sounding, despite digital re-mastering. In Les Preludes, there is simply a lack of conviction, and the lack of affect is made worse by a recording that makes the orchestra sound understaffed by half. A much -- vastly -- better recording is available on Hungaroton (HCD 12446-2) with the Hungarian State Orchestra conducted by Janos Ferencsik. It also includes the tone poems Orpheus and Tasso. All three tone poems are recorded in fine, full sonics, with wonderful hall sound, and receive committed, energetic recordings, just about the best I've found over the years. If you are serious about the Liszt tone poems, don't waste your money on this CD."
5,BRAVO!,"The CD is extraordinary. I have a special fondness to Les Preludes since my daughter played it several years ago at Interlochen Music Camp nearTraverse City, MI."
3,Clarification needed,"Author's blurb on the back cover begins: ""I have written this fiction based on my true story about two near death experiences."" Fiction or truth? The reader is left to sort this out for himself.If I did my sorting correctly, the last half of the book alone is worth the price, but the long, tedious description of his ""sins"" in the middle of the book could be shortened by 75% with no harm to the story.Toward the end of the book Dovel does an excellent job of suggesting ways for the reader to put to use some of the lessons he learned and shared, but even there ... especially there ..... the reader would benefit by knowing to what extent the lessons are based on truth and to what extent they're based on fiction."
2,Poorly written book on an excellent subject,"Wow...the opportunity was there but I felt this book was poorly written. Also, the second ""death"" experience wasn't corroborated medically; he ""died"" in an apartment and ""came back"" in same apartment. I'm less inclined to beleive he ""died"" but have no problem believing it was a spiritual ""dream"".Nevertheless, the experience did have the power to transform his life. I do believe in NDE's, God and the afterlife so my problem with this book wasn't skeptisicm but feel the author lacked writing ability and would have benefited from a good editor."
1,I don't recomennd this book to anyone,"I don't recommend this book to anyone, because the book needs a rewrite and published by a good publisher, one that knows what he is doing!"
4,A Fine Sampling of Some of Our Best Poets,"W.S. Merwin curated single poems from the works of poets who had lived and died during his lifetime and published them under the title LAMENT FOR THE MAKERS: A Memorial Anthology. Himself a Pulitzer Prize winner in 1971, Merwin begins this tasty anthology with an extended poem in which he memorializes (or rather crystallizes) each of the twenty-three poets he has selected. Though not his best poem, it is an apt introduction to works by TS Eliot, WH Auden, James Merrill, Ezra Pound, Sylvia Plath, Robert Graves, Elizabeth Bishop, William Carlos Williams, etc. Reading poems selected by a poet is a lesson in itself. This small anthology will encourage readers, new to some of the poets here, to pursue more complete anthologies (the isolated works are not among the poets' best). A nice bedside book for ending the day in beauty."
1,Ordered 6-Pack - Received ONE,"Love the product, but I was robbed. The description said ""pack of 6,"" and I received one loose box instead. Honestly, I wasn't going to bother with the review or complaint, because my Dad was diagnosed with cancer recently, and this just doesn't matter anymore. I received an email asking me to rate the product, though, and I have a moment, so might as well complain. $11 and change for one box of fabric softener that was supposed to be 6. Kinda sucks. Cancer is worse, so whatever..."
4,Good Scent,"Make sure when ordering this, you do not get anything else from the buyer on the same order. The smell of the sheets will take over whatever is in the box with it. With that said, I like this brand because the scent it leaves on the clothes is not overwhelming. That is why I bought it. I am sensitive to strong smells. Most of the other brands have scents that are too strong for me."
2,Cheaply made,This item has sharp edges and came not entirely flat right out of the box. The teflon seems okay but it's just a piece of aluminum stamped out and not finished.
3,Acceptable Griddle for Light Use,"This griddle is light weight and will barely cover 2 burners on a stove top. The previous reviewer who identified this as a camping griddle is accurate.The heat was even and the food was cooked well. However, after the very first use the non-stick coating has begun to peel off at the edges of the pan. I will probably get another two-dozen or so uses out of it before it has to be recycled. Will shell out for a more expensive grill next time."
4,Like this,"This product, good price and easy to hold and clean, with other burner griddle usually I burn my arm because they are to high.I'm happy, and hope can used for long time"
5,Good for Experienced Coaches!,Experienced coaches will find this very useful. Tough strategies to grasp. Good explanations but I don't agree with all of what he preaches. Coaches looking to go to the next level should purchase.
5,Little League Instruction: Baseball Stuff You Always Wanted Explained!,"In this near perfect Little League baseball DVD, manyof the first and third offensive and defensive strategiesare explained in clear English. If you are into bunting,this DVD does a more than credible job with solidexplanations and strategies you should know even ifyou do not intend to go to the Little League World Series!We loved WINNING BASEBALL STRATEGIES!Baseball Coaching:Schupak's Baseball Super 8 DVD SetYou may want to consider this baseball DVD set by Marty Schupak popular with Little League coaches and parents.Youth Baseball DrillsThis popular baseball book by Marty Schupak is the perfect compliment to his baseball instructional DVDs."
3,Wish there were physical flash cards....,"It's a good book, but I wish it was actual physical flash cards, instead of the way it was presented. I see you can tear the pages out, and cut them into cards, but they're on flimsy regular paper, and prone to damage or tearing. Otherwise, the material is decent, and useful."
2,A help or a harm...,"Pros:1. Quick Review at the end of the book is a nice summaryCons:1. Questions are not at all similar to the real exam2. Multiple choice questions would be more effective than fill in the blank questions with no explanations3. There are many typo's in the sample configurations in the review toward the back of the book. If you applied them to the real exam, your answers would be marked wrong, or your configurations simply would not work"
1,Wrong answers on test,"I would have rate this one ZERO stars, but there is no selection for that, so it gets ONE star,If you are studying for your test, stay away from this publication. The practice test contains a number of wrong answers.One question's 'correct' answer said that to break into the boot sequence, you should issue the break sequence within the first FIVE MINUTES after powering up the router. Another one said that you would need 27 PVC's for a fully meshed wan network of 8 branch offices. That one even spelled out themath in the answer, i.e. n(n-1)/2, or 8(8-1)/2, which is (8*7)/2, which they said equals TWENTY SEVEN!!! I was just blown away.I've emailed cisco press 4 or 5 times on this. I wanted a refund, but they want me to be their proof reader for free.I wish I had read some reviews before I made this purchase. Don't waste your money."
2,OUTDATED QUESTIONS!!!,"Plain and simple, some of the question are outdated. I hate having to go through unneccessary questions to study for this exam. It's bad enough that there is a ton of material that I need to know."
3,"Good info, but not flash cards","Good information, but what you're getting here is a book with flash cards printed on the pages. I guess one could destroy the book by cutting out the pages, but then they would have paper thin flash cards. I was looking for real flash ""cards"", in the traditional sense."
4,Good companion book,This book on its own isnt real good except for cramming. Used with a study system it is excellent. It covers more topics than you will likely find on the test but isnt that the point? If we knew what exactly what was on the test we wouldnt need a study guide or flash cards.
2,Good info...but not the real deal.,"I'm giving this kit 2 out of 5 stars simply because these type of ""child's play"" questions constitute, at max, about 40% of the exam. There are two key topics this book virtually ignores that are vital to the CCNA test...Subnetting and Troubleshooting IP Routing Protocols. One must know class B and C subnets and their addressing schemes inside and out. You must be able to troubleshoot connectivity issues for a few routers that are running one of the following...RIP, IGRP, EIGRP or OSPF. Also, the chapters on Frame Relay and IP Access Lists lack depth. All in all this is a good book but the way it is marketed one could easily be misled."
3,A Good Book to Borrow...,"The CCNA Flash Card and Exam Practice Pack is just what it's advertised as -- a late-phase add on to ensure all the nitty gritty details necessary for the CCNA are locked into your anxiety-filled mind come test day. While the flash card style is handy for quickly flipping through the information, there is a large amount of information in this book not covered in the CCNA objectives. As someone who took the 801 exam, I can't speak on the usefulness of having a separate INTRO and ICND section in the book... you'll have to determine that for yourself. Simulations on the CD were simplistic, but you can create a practice exam of just simulation questions, allowing you to become very familiar with maneuvering a router and switch, ensuring you have the basics down before you get hit with the real sims. As a late stage supplement to Lammle's Sybex book and CertSim simulations, this book is decent, but nowhere near a primary study guide or proper exam simulation tool."
3,penetrating action,"This item works as describes, penetrates dirty coils with foaming action. The amount in the can seems a bit less than enough to complete a serious job, as was the case with the AC that I used this product on. I would recommend using this in a seasonal maintenance capacity. Before installation and maybe before storage."
3,Coil Cleanser's not for Tough Jobs...,"The cleanser worked well on the coils with only a little built up dirt, etc. but the ones that were real dirty are not clean after using spray. They are better but not at all what I had hoped. I used entire bottle and am now going to have to buy something else."
1,pulp fiction at its worst,"The hero of the story is Captain Gringo, and that's about as subtle as it gets. This book is jaw-droppingly awful-- I can't see how anyone with an IQ over 50 could enjoy this. One of the main characters is a naive nubile six-foot-six Amazon who has sex at every opportunity. Fer chrissake, my horny adolescent fantasies were more realistic. In fact, I've read porn novels that were better written. It pains me to think that valuable resources were used to produce this ""novel."""
1,Overcharging for a silly old book!,"The original author is Richard F. Mann (a pen name for Ray Bourbon). It was originally published by him in 1932, WITHOUT an appendix about prostitution. If you want a more recent perspective on prostitution, fictional or otherwise, look elsewhere!While it has some value as a snapshot of the seedy side of Juarez nightlife and bars in the 30's, it's almost painful to read, it's so bad ... not the content, just the writing. If you're looking for something well-written, look elsewhere!If you decide you really, really want to read this, you should still look elsewhere -- download for free from Project Gutenberg!"
3,Vanity published by one of the first famous female impersonators,"Before there was Ru Paul or or Lady Bunny, there was Ray (or Rae) Bourbon, a singer, female impersonator, and vaudeville performer who worked with most of the famous but less respectable but brilliant entertainers of his times (roughly the 1930s through the 1960s), including Mae West and Josephine Baker.The introduction claims that this deliberately sordid look at prostitution, drinking, parties, and violence on the Mexican border is based on real people from real life, though there are so many cliches that it's difficult to tell whether it's because life itself is cliched or whether Bourbon fit the events and people he witnessed into the cliches.In any case, the story is a sad one, told with real affection for the hookers that give the story its title, and an interesting document of the times, but perhaps more interesting as a curiosity than as a great piece of literature."
1,Terribly written.,"A great example for 'how not to write a textbook like this,' or 'how to make people not understand a single bit at all.'"
4,why isn't it longer?,"Every segment to this interesting and relevant documentary tells so much about where we get our traditions, yet sometimes it feels rushed. It could have been a whole hour longer and I would not have moved from my seat!"
3,IT ALRIGHT,"Not bad, but can be better. All other Pure Energy CD has more better songs then this one does."
5,Culture and Man,"I first encountered this book while in High School as a small piece of it was reprinted in an anthropology textbook. Though Henry goes off of the deep end a little bit in the veracity of his anti-American rhetoric, most of his observations are fairly sound. Probably the best analysis of the educational climate and processes ofcultural and social conditioning in the 1950's that I have read. In a sense, education in America is still very much about ""Learning the Nightmare"" as he calls it, wherein children are socialized into an overly hierarchical and competitive environment."
1,Piece of junk,We could not get this camera to turn on. I was looking for a cheap camera for my 6 year old daughter. We put the battery in and nothing happened. The battery was very difficult to remove and even though it's a rechargeable battery...there was no charger included in the packaging or instructions for charging in the camera. It is a completely useless piece of junk and we are returning.
5,What if the Nazis won WWII? dark & plausible with wonderful reader,"This is a dark tale of Germany after WWII -- and the Nazis won the war. Werner Klemperer (remember him? He played Colonel Klink on ""Hogan's Heroes"") is the perfect reader for this book as German was his native language, so of course he pronounces all the German words correctly. Though I normally don't care for abridged books, in my opinion this abridgement is fairly well done and the creepy story makes an impact."
5,leider keine sechs Sterne möglich,"Diesen Film kann ich nicht hoch genug bewerten. Das mag sicher eine rein subjektive Meinung sein, doch gefällt mir hier einfach alles. Die Schauspieler sind gut, die Handlung klar und die Story ein wenig verrückt. Super eben."
5,Pool playing Mom,"I got this for my Son, but have enjoyed it more that he has. He has to ask me to let him play."
2,halloween dvd,not the same show that i wathched on the history channel. was dissapointed. thought i was ordering the same one.
4,History Revealed,"This is an older show, but a good, rounded history of Halloween. It's interesting to see how the different parts came together to be one. Nothing haunted or gory and safe for curious kids to watch as well as entertaining and educational for the rest of us."
2,Not much new information,Most of what this DVD talks about is common knowledge. Not one of my favorites from the History Channel. Bought it to show to my students during that holiday.
3,Okay...not great,"This should be part of a bigger set...it probably is by now... kinda cheezy, but OK for the Halloween season..."
4,Informative!,"The History Channel has always put out some great programs and i think this one was truly the most interesting and informative out of them all on holidays in the USA. Even though, they dont show this very often on History Channel (or any other ""Haunted History""), its very rare that you will see it, maybe every now and then, but, not all the time as most reviewers would suggest..just so you know. I would buy this, not just for the information of the History, but, for the rare viewing that it gets. Highly Recommended!"
2,Disappointed!,"I heard rave reviews about this from friends....unfortunately it was for a different brand. It gets stuck in grass over 2 inches, on inclines and sometimes for no reason at all. The spray wands on the top scrape over the metal hood of the sprinkler...even when positioned straight up. Often one of the wands flies off and I find the sprinkler sitting in the same position it sat 1 hour ago. I have tried supergluing it and refitting it. None of the box instructions or online Q&A give any explanation or tips. My money would have been better spent on an old fashioned sprinkler, a lawn chair, and a couple of cold drinks. What a waste of time and money. I am so disappointed!"
3,Great Customer Service,"I have been using the Orbit 58322 Traveling Sprinkler for less than one full season now. It has its share of problems (sprinkler arms come off, stop mechanism is very unreliable), but for the most part, it does what it is supposed to do. Recently, the drive transmission has started to make some noise that led me to conclude that it was getting ready to die. I sent an e-mail to Orbit to find where I could get replacement parts for the transmission. Their reply was to send me a complete new unit. That was unexpected, but very much appreciated."
5,Sprinkler,Love it! Great price good product! Wanted the John deer but it was too $$$. We are very happy we bought this one.
2,Follows the hose??????,"I've now used this sprinkler 6 times, using various hose configurations, sharp turns to very gentle turns. The sprinkler almost always just pushes the hose in the direction of travel until the turn is sharp enough that the sprinkler just comes off. The sprinkler itself is very solidly constructed seemingly indestructable. It's only other fault is keeping the sprinkler arms attached, they've come off 3 times now.Sorry I can not recommend this product. Can't say I hate because I love the idea.UPDATE:Contacted the manufacturers helpline, they responded almost immediately -they brag about their assistance- and asked that I send them some close-up pictures. After sending the pictures requested, I've heard nothing since. So much for responsive assistance."
2,Don't,This is a poor-quality knock-off of a Nelson Raintrain. Don't bother. Buy a Nelson if you want a spinkler that functions properly.
1,Home Depot sells it for $57,Have not been able to make it travel after 3 hours of fiddling with it. However after it started working it was great! Would change the rating to 5.
2,Green Bill,"The automatic shutoff valve stopped working on the Orbit traveling sprinkler during the first season. The gears were shot in the third season. I live in Oregon where the watering season is very short. The sprinkler worked slow but well for this short amount of time. Over $50 seems rather expensive for only about 7 months of life. I am now considering a rather expensive National Walking Sprinkler as a replacement.After I wrote the above review, I contacted Orbit's online technical assistance department. They informed me that they would replace the sprinkler at no charge even though I no longer had my proof of purchase. That's great customer support!"
1,IT'S A RIP OFF,We bought the sprinkler earlier this summer and the gear box has already gone out. To get a PLASTIC replacement it cost $14.99 but it's impossible to get the back wheels off. we have decided to just throw the damn thing out and never buy another Orbit product again. You would think after paying $65 for the sprinkler that they would make replacement parts that are easier to replace. I guess that is why you don't see them around like you used to. People have caught on to their SCAM.I would definitely not recommend this sprinkler to anyone.
1,You get what you pay for,After about 20 uses the PLASTIC gears have stripped. This may be resolved by keeping hose length to a maximum of 50 feet so the machine doesnt have too much weight to pull around. What good is 50 foot though??? My recomendation is find a model with all metal gears.
3,not good on bare spots,"If you have a freshly seeded yard these type sprinklers wont work, as soon as the unit gets to a bare spot it will get stuck in the mud (remember its travelling thru the area it has just watered).I have only had it a week and it worked ok on the existing lawn it only jumped the track(hose) one time and than tipped over, when that happened the little button water valve on the bottom didnt make contact with anything so the sprinkler ran all night laying on its side. Not sure i would recomend this item but i dont dislike it enough to return it."
2,A Must Read!!!!!!!!,This book was off the chain!!! One of my co-workers got me hooked on your work and it has all been great. I started reading this book on late Saturday night and I was finished with it by Monday morning before I went to work. I could not put this book down. I love all of the characters but especially Mike Black. Are you going to do a story on Wanda so that she can tell her story? I hope so. Please don't make us wait too long before we get the next installation. Be blessed and keep writing..P.S. - The rating should have been 5 stars....(Typo on my part)
4,love it,"I absolutely love this book, roy glenn did a good job. This book gives you a look into the dangerous street life along with the love between a husband and wife.highly recommended"
1,:(,"This book sucks, I don't see how Roy Glenn got a book deal. I could have wrote better. DON'T BUY IT"
1,A piece of junk,"This cartridge puller is a flimsy piece of junk, manufactured in Taiwan. But the worst of it is that this tool doesn't properly fit the top of the Moen cartridge that you're trying to pull. The puller requires a lot of coaxing (e.g. with a hammer) to interlock the tangs on the tool with the tangs on the top of the cartridge. And the thumbscrew on the end of the t-handle is the wrong length to properly fit into the top of the cartridge. It's a poor design and is poorly constructed. I would give it zero stars if I could. Do yourself a favor: Spend a few more dollars and buy the cartridge puller that's manufactured by Moen,Moen 104421 Cartridge Puller, For 1200, 1222 & 1225 Single Handle Cartridges."
5,The only tool to get!,I had to get this tool from a local vendor because I didn't plan ahead and was faced with the faucet half assembled and the water shut off. Before you replace any Moen cartridge have this tool at hand. I didn't and I was able to pull out the inner part of the cartridge and was left with the sleeve still inside. The shorter tools are a waste of money and I don't know why they even sell them because if only the inner part comes out you are stuck just as I was. This one worked like a charm! I had to drive 15 miles to a local vendor and paid twice the price but I was thankful after a whole day without water.
4,Worked for me!,"Had a dripping tub faucet for quite a long time. Using YouTube, I was educated on the replacement of the cartridge and the fact that sometimes they don't come out so easily. I found this Moen cartridge puller on Amazon at a very reasonable price and decided to try it. The instructions weren't the best on how to use it, but in a minute or so I figured out how to attach the puller to the cartirdge, and after a few good tugs, the cartridge came out. Couldn't have replaced the cartridge without it. I recommend it. Thanks Danco."
5,awesome,"I am a huge Carbon Leaf (they do the soundtrack) fan and couldn't wait for this DVD to come out. Now, I am converting my 2 year old to be a big fan :)We put this movie in the DVD player when we went on a 6 hour trip and pushed the replay button. My husband and I got tired of the dialog after 2 or 3 repeats but our son still only wants to watch this movie out of his whole movie selection."
3,"Movie = No, Bonus material = Yes.","My three year old thought it was scary. He didn't like it when ""the bad guy caught George"".He watched the two bonus PBS shows that came on the DVD more than the actual movie."
2,Movie ok - service not right,"We rented this movie to take on our laptop on a trip with our grandkids. Went through the Amazon procedure, paid the money, and had the icon on the computer. When we went to 'play' it started to download. After a half hour we gave up (wanting to get underway) and went to iTunes and rented the same movie, and downloaded it in about 8 minutes. Something wrong with the Amazon movie rental with this one. I complained to Amazon but got no response."
2,Not worth the money,We purchased this movie because our 2 and a half year old loves Corious George. I mean LOVES.. watches it several times a day (thanks Tivo).. but for some reason this Movie took three viewings to watch it all the way through. Each time we would watch from where we left off.Don't know what is going on there but I think it's that there is way too much dialog. In the first movie that had a large budget all of the movie was well done.. lots of musical elements and it didn't seem like crazy amounts of dialog. Always something going on... however in this movie that is just not the case at all.We have only watched this all the way through once.. which makes it not worth the money. The first movie we have seen hundreds of times.. and all of the episodes as well. If you are looking for a Curious George movie get the first one and the Christmas one.
5,Just as Good as the First Movie!,My sons (3 & almost 5) love this movie as much as the first one. It's a really cute story and the music is good too.
5,Excellent,Exactly what we expected. Kids loved it. Will rent again. Love Curious George. We really enjoy Curious George. Thank you!
1,Product Review,"I fell in love with this movie with my daughter watching it on an instant watch movie site. We were excited to own the actually dvd, however it was shipped in box way too large. The DVD was not in celophane. It was allowed to rattle and shake in shipping and the dvd case is broken and disk was loose. The disk has mild scratches, it still works. but I am irritated owning a DVD with no case to store it in.. seems like a waste of money"
1,"We've come a long, not necessarily good, way./","I wonder how many of the reviewers saw Curious George read on Captain Kangaroo. I did. It is my seminal experience with George, most closely resembling the creature in the books by the Reys. Suffice to say, this is not your Captain's George. Somewhere over the years, George, an animal whose curiosity landed him in one predicament after another and from which the human, his friend the Man in the Yellow Hat, repeatedly extricated him, has metamorphosed into a socially conscious being who has to overcome the random acts of irresponsibility of the human. This movie is a sad travesty of the Curious George penned by H.A. Rey and Margaret Rey.As a final note, my two year old grandson, who loves George, watched all of ten minutes, and then asked to go to the park."
1,Caution: Children's Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this book because I have been very happy with DK's travel books. I guess I should have read more carefully: This is a children's book, not a book for travelers. Yes, I know the detailed description says so and I should have read it. But there are probably others who would buy this book based on DK's travel books and without looking at the details. Hence this comment!"
4,"Good price, hard to stay on wall.","Nice little addition to our little one's bathroom, good price. About once a week it falls off the wall, but I guess the instructions said it would do this. It is very cool though!"
4,Zoom lens,"I enjoy the speed-of-focus, although it is not the sharpest of lenses throughout the zoom range. Great lens for the price though."
1,NIKON 18 to 135 lense,Bought a new D80 it came with a 18-135mm lense. Have had problems with the lense and camera making connection. To the point when I had a one of a kind shot and the unit failed me. NOT GOOD. Today I noticed that the lense aperature is not shutting down. Took the lense off camera and can see a few fingers hanging down. I take very good care of my camera and am distressed - MAD - this is happening. I have had the camera for over 1.5 years. The lense should not fail like this.
3,Handy and good lense when not wide open. Mine broke after 1.5 year of light use.,"This lens is versatile. If the lighting is good it produces decent images. It's not very fast, but sufficient for my use (very basic) most of the time. The extra zoom is very handy but I've noticed when the lighting is a bit low (e.g., outdoor early evening), the pictures come out way too dark.I used this lens lightly for about 1.5 year before I took it off to try the new 50mm lens I got for Christmas. 6 months later I put this lens back on the camera and it wouldn't focus. During the 6 months it was not used it was just sitting on my desk. I don't know how it could be broken! Now I have to send it back to Nikon for repair and it won't be back on time for a big trip coming up. So now I am looking for a new lens. I am seriously considering the 18-200vr lens. If you have the extra few hundred dollars, I say get the 18-200vr lens. Otherwise stick with the standard kit lens and save up the money for the 18-200vr lens."
2,Breaks easily,"As stated in previous reviews, a small bump to the lens can cause major issues. Really poorly constructed product. Not for active users."
2,excellent resolution but poor construction. Mine failed after 2 months of use.,"The lens has excellent resolution, and quite nice image quality. Not as good as the 18-70, but the longer zoom reach was worth it for me. Problem is, it is too fragile a lens. Mine stopped focusing after a 5 inch fall INSIDE a padded photo bag. And a friend of mine had the same problem with no apparent reason. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,It was a great lens before it broke,"I enjoyed using this lens alot. It got me from wide to close and focused quickly. I was about 1 month into using it and it started whining during focusing, especially in landscape shots. I am about to take it back to Wolf and get an 18-200mm, which is the one I wanted anyway."
4,Nikon 18-135mm,"Sharp, Good Zoom Range, Works perfectly on my D50 and D70s. Does have strong Chromatic Aborations"
1,An extremely weak book,"This book intends to give new insights of Nambu mechanics, but up to some calculations in differential forms (in sense of Cartan, but were prolongations and other fundamental topics are not treated), authors do not provide any sustainable physical result. It seems obvious that they are far from having expertise on physics. There is no mention to multibrackets in this book, which is the well known technique to attack the problem."
5,The Best!,I have tried a lot of leave-in conditioner and found myself always coming back to this one. It helps to leave my hair softer and not feel weighed down or greasy. Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner is a good product for all hair types to have in there hair regiment.
3,"Great Ingredients, Good Price, Not For Some Of Us WIth A Huge Head Of Curls",My title says it all. This product would probably be great for someone that needs less hold/control.My hair became too big and frizzy when I used it. I wish it would have worked for me. I might try anotherone of their gels or their other products.
4,great moisturizer,great moisturizer for your hair gave it a 4 because if you use it with another oil based product it makes your hair white but will disappear within 5 minutes
3,Not for coarser hair,"I do the curly girl method and I bought this because it is described as a lightweight leave in. My hair is coarse but very fine, so I can't use moisturizing oils or creams - they're too heavy.Unfortunately this is too light and doesn't provide enough slip to detangle or keep it untangled,The search goes on!This product does smell good. I passed it on to another curly with thicker, less coarse hair and she loves it."
1,makes hair sticky,"I am not Anthony I am his wife. I have used this product for many years and was very pleased with it.I have very curly, coarse, dry hair. As you may imagaine I was thrilled to find this leave in conditioner.Over the past 6 months I discovered that this product became Eco friendly and no longer hair friendly. I have no idea what they changed but it is no longer something I can use.I wish that when a product is good they would simply leave it alone. When I began using the older formula my hair was shiny, soft and managable. With the current product my hair acts as though I left a big glob of conditioner in it, it is dull and very sticky. Getting a comb through it is impossible."
1,"Same Name, Different Product","This used to be a great leave-in conditioner. Now it has been reformalized, with aloe added as the main ingredient. Aloe is good for many things but hair is not one of them. The main problem, and it's a big one, is stickiness. Weightless it is not. Instead, it is more like free-flowing Crisco.The original formula was identified on the bottle as Pure Organic. Now it calls itself Eco-Chic, whatever that means."
1,WTF????,"I'm a black women who enjoys my hair natural. I heard a lot of hype about this product on youtube and several other blogs that were actually pretty referable. So I gave it a shot. At first it seemed to be making my hair soft, but the next morning, my hair was hard as a rock! I could bearly pull it back in a puff. I had to suffer through work all day until I was finally about to come home and scrape that crap out of my hair."
2,Giovanni hair care leave in conditioner,"I've used this product in the past and fell in love with it. I order this product assuming that I will be getting the exact same product i had. It's not the same anymore. They changed the ingredients/formula. Its very disappointing because the old formula worked wonders. The new formula sucks! It doesn't detangled nor moisturizer as well...and it seems I have to use a lot more than I have with the old formula. Anyway, if you can find the old formula with (oils) instead of aloe vera gel in the new formula, I highly recommend to buy it! Dont waste your money on this one."
5,Words can't describe,Words can't really describe how much I love this stuff. I will never stop using it. I love its light weight texture and the effect it has on my hair. Leaves my hair moisturized.
2,Ok product,"I'm African American with natural hair (Not sure what type. Can't figure nor am I too stressed with the whole type thing...lol) I know the formula has now changed, so I guess I am to late. I saw so many reviews on this product that was saying wonderful things prior to the formula change. I think it is OK...nothing to brag about. I think it sort of suds up after putting in hair when wet. Better to use with dry hair."
5,Conditioner,This is one of the best conditioners I have ever used! It leaves my hair so soft and easy to manage. It also gives me a sleek look when I flat iron it. I can wear my style longer and it's because of this conditioner. I have tried many different conditioners and this is the best by far. Love - love love it!!
4,"great for 4a, 4b hair",This product is very moisturizing without being heavy or greasy. It has a light fresh scent. I use it under eco styler gel to combat dryness. It is a great end protectant.
4,great product for black women with natural hair,"This leave-in does the job on natural hair. Softens while is conditions. Keeps hair manageable, I love it so far."
2,There are better leave in conditioners out there,"I don't care for this product much due to the white residue it left in my hair. I've discontinued using this product. Besides as a natural hair girl, I was searching for a product that was all natural or mostly natural and this product does not fit that bill."
1,Not pleased at all,"I am african american with type 4b hair, since this product was great for all hair types i tried it. I washed and conditioned my hair with my own products, then put in the leave in condionter. At first my hair felt smooth but them began klumping up. I let my hair air dry and my hair was ten times worst. It left my extremely knotted, and dry. I usually wear my hair in a bun but that was even a hassel, i just washed the product out."
5,Great Product,"I love this leave-in. I kept trying different leave-ins hoping to find something by an African-American owned company that I could support, but it's a no go. This is the best leave-in I've tried by far. I'm done searching for others. It is very moisturizing, light, melts in my hair, it's a good detangler, fairly priced and smells good. I can also get it at Target and the Vitamin Shoppe, so it's readily available."
4,Good NOT Great,"Well I've been using this product for about a wk now and Im pleased but I wanted a lil more. Giovanni is an excellent product if you want NATURAL, but as far as moisturizing, which is what I wanted Its ok, explains the 4 stars. EverybodieS hair is different and mine is typical right on the verge of being dry. TO ME ITS BETTER AS A PRE WASH. As far as shipping it took my product about a wk to get here so the site was pretty accurate. Im satisfied I guess."
3,not worth all the hype,was just ok.. not sure what I expected but was like normal conditioner in my hair rather than a leave in-I didnt notice a difference
2,Very Disappointed!,"After reading many highly rated reviews, I had high hopes that this leave-in conditioner would detangle and condition my long fine colored and permed hair. Unfortunately it does not! This item looks and feels like moisturizer and doesn't detangle, repair, or manage hair. Once your hair dries, it leaves my hair heavy and some strands crunchy and hard like the look and feel of mousse. in order to use up the bottle, I now use the rest in the shower and it doesn't condition or detangle very well wet either. I'm very disappointed and will never buy this item again. Sticking to my DermaOrganic Intensive Hair Repair Masque."
2,Meh...,"I have read many blogs on which people rave about this product, especially for curly hair. I couldn't wait to get to Whole Foods to buy the Direct Leave-In along with Smooth as Silk shampoo and conditioner. Unfortunately, I am quite underwhelmed. I find the Direct Leave-In to be too light for my hair. It also took a while to absorb, so it sat on my hair until my hair dried. Not cool. No one likes to walk around looking like they didn't properly rub the product into their hair. This could be because I used more leave-in than I normally use since this product is not as thick as my usual leave-in. I hope other reviewers have a better experience, but I will not purchase this product again."
4,Good little knitting machine,"We bought this for my 8-year-old daughter's ""business"" project at school. She ended up having to make about 13 scarves. The machine works fine but the person turning the crank has to be very careful to watch that the yarn is picked up by each hook properly. After a while, your head starts to spin because you're watching closely and the thing just keeps turning. Aside from that and the yarn which comes with the set (not good), it works fine. Test it out with various thickness yarns and you'll see what works best.The tube scarves are much easier than the panel scarves.Don't expect to ""get it"" the first or the second time. But after that you'll be used to it (and the child using it with you) and you'll be amazed at how quickly you can make a scarf."
3,"It's alright, just be patient with it","The first time I bought this and found out about it, I always wanted it. Tried it out and it broke, send the receiept to the manufacturer and gave me a replacement and finally it worked, the things i dont like is that it gets jammed too many times and the yarn keeps getting stuck to one hook which can mess up the item. My sister loves using this item so ill give this 3 starswww.JDizaClothingco.com"
3,great intro to knitting but not made to last,"I am a ""regular"" knitter and have been dying to teach my 10 yro daughter how to knit but up until now she has shown little or no interest. She got this knitting machine and ""presto"" now she's a knitter and is beginning to express her own interest in the craft-yea! This machine does spit out a quick tube scarf but be warned: you must teach the user to watch for mistakes! We discovered(after restarting once already) that one of the ""needles"" was defective and not releasing the previous stitch as it was supposed to. By trial and error, I taught my daughter how to do it manually with a crochet hook and the rest of the scarf turned out great. Good intro to knitting but the machine isn't perfect or made to last. Good news is that it forces you to think about the stitch and how it's being made."
1,Not worth the trouble,"My daughters (8 and 5) received this as a gift. They were thrilled! They made 2 scarves with a LOT of help and a couple of times we had to start over completely. Even when the scarves were completed I had to go back and fix some dropped stitches. A few months later, we tried it again and they were completely frustrated - even though they were trying to be very slow and careful. I thought it was because of the yarn I purchased, so today I tried some yarn similar to what the machine came with. Result: Disaster and some very dissapointed girls! One tooth just wouldn't drop the yarn properly causing the next tooth to miss. Another tooth just kept sticking. I have restarted it four times now and I am done.I am recycling the plastic... that's all it is good for."
1,Terrible product,We just received it; and you can spin it. It kept on blocking after 5 turns which made it impossible to make hats or leggings or tube scarves. Terrible buy!Warning: NSI has no customer service and the website they provide does not exist. You won't be able to reach anyone to get your money back. Do not buy this product.
5,Thrilled 7yr old.,"This is not a hand it to them and leave them to their own devices sort of project. It is a Mommy/Daddy and me type of craft. Once I got cast on, and did a couple of rows I was able to pass it off to her and let her go. She did a great job! Scarf was a tube type and just adorable, she was so proud of it. I have not tried panels yet, she is still excited with tubes, so all our yarn is becoming tube scarfs for her little friends and of course Aunties and Grandma. Read all the instructions and be patient. It has a learning curve, but I found it very enjoyable to sit and crank it for awhile. I am not a knitter, but even I figured it out."
3,new york girls,"We need the instructions, please!Would anyone be willing to fax us the instructions? Daughter received machine for Christmas from aunt & has lost the instructions already!!Any help would be greatly appreciated.Please reply or comment."
1,Not Very Good,I think that this item is hard to use.One reason is that it doesn't always hook the yarn. Another reason I don't like this item is that it is hard to do the last step. The last step is to put the end of the yarn through the loops that are left behind when you are done. Finnaly I would like to say I could never get very far into it because one your arm gets tired from cranking the handle and two because you can't undo mistakes. I think they could make it better by finding an easier way to make it go then cranking it and making it be able to undo mistakes.
2,Unreadable pseudo-literature,"This is one of the most overly wordy books I've ever read. It's about convoluted, emotional human relationships during the Civil War period, and it's practically incomprehensible. I've struggled my way through to a chapter in which I have no way to tell who's narrating, and I'm about to give up. Nearly all the action is internal, and the incredible wordiness obfuscates any trace of meaning. Pretentious nonsense. Skip it."
3,These guys are great..re-release their work!!,"The fact that these guys are no longer screaming is a tradgety! They had a sound unapproached by any other band. Shriekback ,in my view, in their earlier music projected the same energy...and both lead singers had no hair...a coincidence!? Fact is I had their first albumn on record but would dearly love it on Disc..so if you can help...email me at chris@centralpower.co.nz I WANT THIS ALBUM....it is the greatest!!!! I have searched America and Australia for a copy but so far come up empty handed...please help me...I'm dying out here."
2,So So ...,"For the most part, this product is and works as advertised. It was easy to setup and get going. Even streaming the video over the internet was very easy to do. I was however not very happy with the picture quality. It seamed a little too pixelated and dark. Also I highly recommend that if you are getting one of these, spend a little extra and get the one with sound built in. It's worth it."
4,Great Cam Love the thing,"I got one to ""play with"" around the house the monitor from my office. Love the thing! The most difficult part was poking the hole in my firewall (Linksys) but that was really simple too. I don't need sound or panning capability so this is great. Pics are fantastic. If it has a drawback it is that the zoom in the Java mode flickers but that would probably work out with some tinkering. I plan on putting in 3 or 4 more of these as security monitors and to observe the wildlife around the house during the day. See my pics I have posted."
1,Didn't work!!!!!,"I recently bought this item and could not get it to work at all. I could monitor from inside my home, but couldn't access it at all from outside my home. I tried everything from port forward to DMZ Server and nothing. I emailed tech support with my issues and all they did was send me links to things I already tried and it didn't work. They said they didn't currently have anything posted to specifically support the TV-IP100W network issues. Why would you sell a camera and not have the proper documentation to support all troubleshooting areas?"
2,Lousy Tech Support,"Trendnet strikes again. Probably a decent camera, but if you are trying to have someone connect to it from the internet, good luck! I've been working on it off and on for 3 weeks and their tech support is worthless. I've gotten more help from Google searches than from these idiots in TS. Takes 3 days to get a stupid one-line answer from them on email. Take my advice and buy something else!"
2,"Very good camera, awful service",The camera works very well and the picture is clear. As daylight leaves the picture quality diminishes rapidly. Very good light is required. The problem with Trendnet is the service. I needed to configure my computer and router. It took 1-2 days every time I wanted to speak with someone and if I had to speak tho an agent a second time there was another 1-2 day wait. I am not a tech person and remote access required several settings to be correct. It took me over week to get enough support to get the cameras to work as described. The product manuals assume a certain level of knowledge that I would suspect the average camera installer doesn't have.
4,"Simple, effective, compatible","Works great, right out of the box, compatible with all browsers I've thrown at it, Safari, Firefox, Explorer. Good wireless range. If you're looking at DLink, stop it! Get the Trendnets. I've several WIFI cameras, and these give you the least trouble. Linksys is pretty solid, but only works with Windows, basically. Also loses it's mind occassionally. The Trendnets have neither of these problems."
5,Running like a champ,"I'm using mine as a baby cam. Also, I have it put a picture on my ftp server every 15 minutes, and run scheduled (AT command) batch files to copy the newest jpg to a known file name. Then, I or my family just click the link (ftp://name:pswd@www.mysitexxx.com/camera/babypic.jpg) and look at the latest picture.I use dyndns.org and some software to keep my home computer's IP updated there. This lets me remotely use a domain name instead of IP address.To initially configure it, I had to change the IP of my other computer wired to my router to 192.168.0.x I then configured the wireless camera for 192.168.1.20 and put in the WEP code.I have a web server on port 80, so I configured it to also use port 81 (which I put in my browser as :81 after the URL.) I told my Linksys router to send port 81 (and the higher ports the camera uses) to 192.168.1.20.It's nice just being able to move it around and plug it into the wall outlet."
2,These decorations were unacceptable possibly out of date and very disappointing,The sugar was beginning to break up. The decorations stuck to the paper and broke apart when I tried to put them on cupcakes.
4,Very good,As current police officer i found this book is very very good.It highlights all the important issues that are so easy to forget.It helps you to really realise that you can never stop training and also dismisses all the false ideas about patrolling on the street.It also incorporates a lot of psychological aspects about criminals and will definately help you to think on your feet should the situation arise.Only thing i would have like to have seen more of is graphical illustrations.Excellent book otherwise
5,Unique music !!,"Renaldo & loaf composes music that just grows on you but you dont know why... Everytime you listen to it, you wonder what catches you, I think there are very stong melodic inside these tunes. Only for those with musical open minds but still, it is , in my opinion, very musical in melodic terms."
4,Certainly not a CD to buy for your Grandmother,"Renaldo and the Loaf are tied to the Residents in many ways throughout their career, either by sharing living quarters, using the same studio, borrowing each other's instruments, helping each other out, etc.For the uninitiated, this album could very well be one of the most ""catchy"" but bizarre albums ever made. The vocals are high-pitched, the music is truly strange, the concept is very high, and for those who like Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, The Residents, and other strange acts, this band is a definite must. Your friends probably won't like it, but you will. Give it a listen!"
1,not a winter cover just debris,"I guess it wa ok but I felt like it was not what I odered I thought it was for the winter pool cover not just to keep the leaves out I think for the money it was not worth it and was not what i needed ,"
5,Thought-provoking!,The characters are well played and the show is interesting. I love it! The show examines the many ways our minds work and is not afraid to pair that with controversial topics. It is perfect for a thinking mind that likes to hear both sides. I like how they treat what some would call crazy as an extension of that person not their limit. A truly sought after and refreshing show!
4,Fun Show,Perception is a fun show with a good grasp of the science and a real understanding of the characters it presents.
1,Not So Intriguing to Me,This jsut did not grab me as i had anticipated. I did not finish watching it and have no desire to spend time watchig it again.
2,Perception online,"This was not good. It often stopped to ""reload"" which made it difficult to watch. Also, each time I tried to access it, there was a message that said there was problem with the payment and to ""click here"". I ended up getting charged twice for the same videos."
4,Complex lead character makes the show interesting.,"One of those shows that would have made it past a first season if it had been findable by its audience. Eric McCormack (best known as Will of ""Will and Grace"") is excellent; although the female FBI agent is a little too young-looking to be believable -- something that might have been adjusted in a second season. But, the complexity of the main character takes an original bent and makes the show well worth the time spent watching it."
4,A winner!,"Intriguing plots. Must have missed the part where the dead psych was explained, but have enjoyed each episode so far. jj Las Vegas"
4,GOOD CONCEPT,"HAVE KNOWN PEEPS LIKE THIS....SCRUFFY LOOK IS GOOD...NOT ALL IN LIFE IS POLISHED...ALSO GOOD TO SEE IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE....NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE A ""REALISTIC"" CHARACTER THO...ACTING IS GREAT..."
4,great,"VERY fast moving. NOt for the average TV viewer.This series combines, science, medicine and psychological all into one. I love it."
2,meh,"i was disappointed. the premise got my interest. the actual show lost it completely. if meh could be very, this would be very meh."
3,It's TV,"Nothing great. A good, solid tv show. Very similar to a couple already out there. Basic story-line... Weird, eccentric genius solves mysteries."
4,GREAT VACUUM FOR THIS PRICE RANGE,I purchased this for my daughter who has a smaller house that would make a larger vacuum difficult to use. The small size doesn't affect it's strength! It does a great job picking up dirt from carpet. Easy to use and the self-propelling is great. The only draw backs I noted were the hose does seem on the light weight side...looks like it could collapse easily if squashed at all. The other thing was there is no way to stop the brush action on hard floors. You just have to adjust it high enough so that the brushes won't hit. We read the directions several times and that was the only thing we could come up with! It made it tough on uneven tile flooring...it wouldn't suction everything up because we had to set it high so as to not the hit the high spots in the tile. This vacuum is definitely a better design for carpets!
4,I love this vacuum!,"I purchased this vacuum a few months ago and couldn't be happier...not just me, but everyone in the house who uses it...it's lightweight, and very powerful...easy to use and clean. If there was one thing I would have them add to this to make it a perfect ""5"" it would be better attachments. Amazon offers it at a great price and I think you'll be more than happy."
1,Don't be fooled,"I have three kids, and I bought this vacuum in Jan 2003, and it is the worst vacuum I ever had (after a hoover and another Eureka). First of all it is NOT QUIET. Second, I have a wool rug and end up having some wool hairs all over, it does not pick it up. You have to go over an area at least twice for it to be cleaned. It is very heavy, and I mean VERY. After owning this for three monthes, vacuuming became a nightmare that I try to avoid, and this led to my apartment being filthy. I agree with the person that said that you will end up doing the cleaning manually, I sure did. It is really annoying that I am looking for a new vacuum just three monthes after I bought this one."
2,Vacuum lost its power!,"I bought this vac two years ago. For the first year it was great, picked up everything. But now after two years, it hardly picks up a thing. I've changed filters, but this vacuum is toast. I won't buy it again."
2,Disappointing Performance,"The price is right, but the overall performance is poor. When we fist used the machine it appeared we were getting more dirt than the previous vacuum we had. Additionally there were a lot of carpet fibers in the canister. Be warned if using on olefin carpet (Berber), the brush agitator will burn and melt it. Additionally edge cleaning is very poor, you will need to use the hose to get the edges clean. When using the tools and attachments the hose will collapse and restrict the airflow."
5,Good deal,"Just bought this vacuum and I am very impressed with it. It has all the features I need for a busy household-kids and pets. It is powerful and versatile. Light enough for my bad back to deal with and pushes with relative ease compared to alot of other vacuums I tried out. Hope the anti-clog hose works cause thats how my last 2 Eureka vacuums finally went.Well, time will tell. Their customer service is very good. Just call the 800 number. They are very helpful. And best of all the vacuum is mercifully quiet as compared with others I tried that sounded like Jets taking off at the airport. The pros for this vacuum are many. The only con I can think of is that the hose could be a little longer. But other than that I would highly recomend this vacuum. So far I am very happy with it and I am very particular about my vacuums. We use it almost every day, so you gotta love your machine. This one is a keeper."
4,Great for Pets,"We have been using our Litespeed for nearly a year and a half (if not longer), and I am continually amazed (and appalled) at how fast the cannister fills up. (Several birds and two dogs can put quite a hurt on plush carpet.) We have never had a problem with it, other than the dog smell it emits to remind us that it is time to clean the dust cup filter. If there are more powerful vacuums out there, and with price as a guide I'm sure there are, we haven't yet felt a need to upgrade.I have heard good things about the Dyson vacuums, particularly with regard to pets, but Consumer Reports did not appear overly impressed in their annual buying guide. To be fair, they weren't overly impressed with the Litespeed, either. The only true test is to vacuum your carpet first with the Litespeed, then with the competition, and decide for yourself.Bottom line: Great price, and a real workhorse. Powerful suction direct from the hose and with attachments. Easy cleaning and filter replacement. HEPA."
4,Great value,I bought this vacuum after reading the other positive reviews and they were right. Best feature is that it's quiet - worst is the lack of accessories and cleaning tools. The suction is above average and it's light-weight and easy to use.
4,The best my carpet has looked in years,"This is our 2nd bagless vacuum that we purchased to do the majority of our home. Our first vacuum had all of the same features with inferior filtration. This vacuum picks up everything from every day dust to pet hair to all the dirt and grime that my dog manages to dig up in my backyard. It glides across the floor without breaking your back or neck, its adjustable roller heights allows this vacuum to perform exceptionally, on almost all surfaces. The drawbacks of this vacuum are that while having a clear dust cup to allow you to see the dirt and grime you pick up, if you do not scrub out the cup after every use you will feel the need to build a seperate room on your house without lights so that your guests never see the disgusting dirt and grime that build up on the cup."
5,Great Job!,"The first time I used this vacuum, several points stood out. One, very lightweight, little effort to push, and amazing cleaning. We had just rug shampooed last week, and I was shocked to see how much cat hair (we have two cats) and dirt were in the carpet in less than a week. Emptying the dirt catcher and cleaning the filter were quite easy, the instructions for assembling were clear, and overall, for the price, an excellent vacuum."
4,Great vacuum at a great price.,"i just bought this vacuum and i'm very pleased. i'm amazed at the amount of dirt it picks up. i had just vacuumed a few days ago with my old vacuum cleaner (Eureka Boss) and thought there wasn't much dirt to pick up, but the Eureka Whirlwind caught a lot. my carpets look much cleaner. it's pretty quiet too. definitely get one of these while you can!"
1,The worst vacuum EVER,"Absolutely DO NOT buy this vacuum. I received it as a gift as a replacement for my Dirt Devil. It doesn't even compare to my Dirt Devil. It DOESN'T PICK UP DIRT!!! I have all tile floors and can run my hand on the floor immediately after vacuuming and pick up a ton of sand and dirt. Also, the attachments are horrible and the hose occassionally pops out while you are vacuuming. The one star is even too good of a rating for this vacuum. Do yourself a favor and look else where. This thing is not a VACUUM!"
1,Bottom of Consumer Reports list,"FYI for those of you thinking about this vacuum. I registered for this vacuum as a wedding present. We got it about 2 weeks ago and just never got around to opening it. In the mean time, my next issue of Consumer Reports came. Low and behold this vacuum rates at the very BOTTOM of their list. I had picked this vacume out because of the positive reviews I had read here at Target.com. However with such CR poor ratings, I am thankful we never opened it up. Out of 33 upright vucuums, the Eureka Whirlwind Lite 4388 is ranked last at 33."
1,"No pun intended, but this vacuum sucks!","...it's going back today.While the vacuum is very quiet and very powerful, the hose makes it unusable.This hose is a very soft plastic, almost rubber-like. As a result it is very flexible - if the machine is off. Once you turn it on, the hose contracts to all of about 1'. It is VERY hard to stretch it when the machine is on.But the reason I'm returning it is the HOSE GETS CLOGGED very easily. In the past three weeks, I've come home FIVE times to a clogged hose...this is being used for carpet cleaning only.I have NEVER had a problem like this with any other cleaner."
5,Slam dunk,"I decided a few months ago that I wanted to get a vacuum cleaner because the little dirt devil wasn't doing the job. Finally I went to the local warehouse club and bought three of their most comparably priced models of upright bag-less vacuum cleaners. (I reviewed the other two as well). This was by far the superior vacuum in the trial. It was the last one to vacuum the carpets and it picked up the most dirt and dust. It was the most maneuverable, works well on both carpet and bare floors, and the easiest dust can to clean. For the money, it has to be the best and most practical vacuum that one can buy."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"... I originally had looked at high end Eureka Oxygen canisters, but settled on this one based on price and reputation.I'm glad I went this this one and saved [money]! We have five cats and I didn't realize how much fur was on the floor until I used this vacuum. It is incredible. It picks all the dirt and fur up, the carpeting has never looked better. I used to sneeze after using my old vacuum, but with the HEPA filtration on the Eureka, the dust doesn't get shot out into the air again! The wand and attachments work beautifully.The only drawback is having to clean out the filter after every use because it gets so dirty. Other than that, it's great to have a bagless system, so you don't have to worry about buying bags.If you have [money], and need a vacuum, get this one!"
4,Very Impressed,"When my $500, barely out of warranty Oreck vacuum needed a new motor (which cost more than the price of this Eureka), I decided to go another route.I was astounded by the power of this machine. It is a great value!"
2,unhappy with customer service and quality of vacuum,"When I received the vacuum cleaner, the box wasn't factory sealed and had no invoice inside. It wasn't factory wrapped and I feel it was a return that was reshipped to me. Unhappy with customer service, not friendly and supervisor that was supposed to call back in 1-2 days didn't call back. Had to look on the internet for a number to call. When someone contacted me she was unfriendly.The vacuum itself is too heavy for stairs and has nothing to hold on to going up the stairs and is plastic and cheaply made.I received it today and I'm sending it back tomorrow."
1,DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM,"I recieved this vacuum as a birthday gift from my mother. I picked it out because of all the good reviews. This vacuum worked really well for the first month, but then the belt started to burn. I was concerned and called Eureka and they guided me to my local service center. I took it there and they replaced my belt even though the belt wasn't broken and charged me $13. The problem continued and even got worse. Now the belt won't stay on at all. This is the worst vacuum I have ever used, and no customer service from Eureka."
1,Great while it lasted,"I liked the convenience of this lightweight machine and the easy to use attachments. For the whole six months it lasted this vacuum worked really well. This was under normal household use in a small townhouse. Great design, lousy motor."
5,Eureka WhirlWind LiteSpeed Vacuum,"I spent well over a thousand dollars on the latest generation Kirby thinking I was getting the best vacuum possible. When we needed a new vacuum for the showroom at work I searched reviews for units under $150 and found the Eureka. When I purchased it my boss informed me he had the same unit at home and loved it. After a week the carpets looked better than they had in months. I was so impressed I bought one to try at home, at first my wife was upset that I needed a new vacuum after recently spending big money for the other one. A week later all were convinced and no one has used the Kirby in over 6 months. One of the other people at work replaced her Kirby as well. I'm not saying the Kirby is bad because it's not but the Eureka WhirlWind LiteSpeed Vacuum is the best I have ever used especially since we have dogs that shed and my wife and daughter have allegies. Since switching neither have had any allergy problems related to the home."
4,Good vacuum for the price,"This is a pretty decent vacuum. Nice long cord, so you can do more than one room without having to plug into another outlet. Easy to change and clean filter and dust cup. Quiet, easy to push, and with the HEPA filter, you don't get that just-vacumed smell. I think that the on-board accessories are a bit hard to use-- not much reach on the hose. There's only a brush attachment, so it doesn't do much on upholstery or stairs. I won't be getting rid of my small canister vac, but for the floors, this is a good deal."
4,The single-best vacuum I've ever owned!,"HIGHLY recommended! Light, easy to push/carry, with a simple emptying-system, AND HEPA filter, this is hands-down the best vacuum for the price on the market!My only complaint is that stairs are a bit tough, but with all the other things I like about this product, it just doesn't matter!"
1,worst thing I ever buy,"People who make this thing should not call it ""vacuum cleaner"".It not vacuum and, of course, not cleaning. It doesn't vacuum threads from carpet and you have chance to make some exercises while cleaning your house. It's heavy and doesn't have any handles to pick it up on second floor."
1,Worst vacuum I've every purchased,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM! When I finish vacuuming my floors are they supposed to look worse than they did when I started? With this vacuum they do. It can barely pick up sock lint. And anything it does pick up it just spits back out. It's the worst piece of s*** vacuum I've every owned. When we first got it home it worked great but after that first time it just completely let us down. I don't know about most people but $90 is a lot of money to spend for me and this was just a waste. I will never buy another Eureka vacuum again. Next time I will spend a little more and buy a Kirby or something else more powerful and leave this piece of garbage alone.
2,Cheap and it's ok,"Too much cleaning. You must be outside when empty the dust container otherwise all the dust will be all over the room again. And you have to clean it after every single time you vacuum because the cup filter inside the dust container gets dirty pretty soon so you have to keep washing it and wait until it drys for the next use. Besides this filter, the vacuum cleaner has two other filters to maintain clean: the pre-motor filter and the HEPA cartridge filter. So I would really recommend to go for regular vacuum with bags."
3,Wonderful for like 6 months,I was so impressed and told every one of my friends to buy an Eureka 5740a genesis vac but now it's been about 6 months and the suction has gone kaputz! I'd say about 25% deduction in suction power. I've tried cleaning/declogging from the inside out and the suction still sucks!
2,If you like vacuuming on your hands and knees....,"I recently switched from my Dirt Devil upright to the Eureka bagless vacuum. I mostly switched because of the bagless and Hepa features and because I have a cat who sheds quite a bit in the Summer.Most of the reviews I read about this product said this vacuum was the best for pulling up pet hair than most others out there. I was sold!I was so excited to receive my new vac, but was quickly disappointed. The vacuum worked like a charm the first two times and that's it. The vacuum now has a high pitch whistle and DOES NOT pick the cat hair up! Thankfully, the vacuum comes with a brush attachment which I connected to the hose and that FINALLY picked up the cat hair! But who enjoys vacuuming on their hands and knees??!!!I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone with pets and am replacing the Eureka with one that will work.My next vacuum will be a Hoover or Dirt Devil -- tried and true, they WORK!I hope this review helps someone! :)"
5,"Finally, Clean Carpet","I have had a pretty poor vacuum for the past 3.5 years. So anything would have been an improvment. I bought this yesterday and came home to clean my carpet. I was AMAZED at how much this vacuum picked up. When I turned it on, it almost took off because it has so much power. Also, it is much quieter than the old one. The one drawback is cleaning the filter. But it's minor in comparison to the benefits. I bought this based on reviews from this site and am very pleased. Thanks."
1,No bare floor setting?,I bought this and then found I couldn't use it because it has no way to stop the carpet brush so I can use it on my tile floors.
2,No upholstery nozzle or extension wand for this vacuum,"If you only want a good carpet sweeper, this is the vacuum. This is the first vacuum cleaner I have bought that does not come with an upholstery nozzle or an extension wand. The only attachments are a dust brush and a crevice tool nested inside the permanent wand. The parts and service reps at Eureka confirmed that there are no other attachments made that will fit this vacuum cleaner, so I cannot order the needed upholstery nozzle or extenstion wand. The difference in the wand size is enough so none of the generic Eureka attachments will fit."
3,Great Vac - but belt breaks ALL the time!,"This vacum works wonders. I love it. However, if you try and use it on a rug attached to another rug - it's belt will snap before you can even pull it away. I am on my 4th belt in 6 months. If they can fix this - it would be prefect!"
4,Very nice vaccuum for a good price.,I just purchased this vaccuum and used it for the first time. It does a great job. It picked up stuff I didn't know existed in my carpet. It's quiet and it is easy to move around the carpet. The only drawbacks are the relatively small dirt container and lack of attachments. But how often do we use those attachments anyway. I'll just have to get use to emptying the container every couple of rooms...
4,Fun Bass,"Right off the top, there is no denying that this is a badass looking bass. Nothing screams ""rock n' roll"" quite like the Thunderbird. For rock and punk this is definately a good bass for the money.The neck is not as slim and fast as the Gibson version, and it's a bolt on rather than a neck-through, but at only a fraction of the cost you get a great looking, great sounding bass."
3,Interesting story but nothing new here,I like stories of people who build businesses and while I am unfamiliar with this company I took a chance on the story. The storyline is interesting how they got the company turned around and built it into what it is today. The timeless principles are nothing you havent read but hey these ladies are successful and it is a nice read but no big lessons just a good success stroy.
5,You may now kiss the bride!,"I've loved all the entries in the Carnegie Kincaid series, but this one may be my favorite. All of Donnelly's most charming and eccentric characters are gathered together for a party even a Red Sox fan would enjoy! There's something for everyone in this mystery--wonderful wedding details, an insider look at professional baseball, and even a glimpse of the Goth music scene. Carnegie's strong points are her curiosity and her connections with her friends--both draw her into unraveling the death of a nasty sportswriter in BRIDE AND DOOM. And best of all, the reader has the satisfaction of watching Carnegie struggle with her own wedding plans. Cozy mystery reading at its finest!"
4,Spring Fever,I really liked this one even though I had it figured out midway through. I loved the backdrop of baseball and Boris being front and center. I enjoyed the progression of Aaron and Carnegie's relationship and I found the ending extremely satisfying. A fun read!
5,Always enjoyable,"I love the way Deborah Donnelly really gives you a sense of place with her Seattle settings, and this time we get a wilderness hike as well. The writing, plot and characterizations are all well done. However, I did guess ""whodunit"" this time, and I haven't before."
2,"Supplier issue, not manufacturer.","The Handy Andy gloves themselves were great, just as Handy Andys have been for decades. My issue was with the company that sent them to me. 2 of my 4 pair were so faded and discolored, you could tell they had been sitting on a shelf in the sun for quite some time. If I had been ordering for myself, no biggie, as the quality of the gloves was still good. However, I was ordering them as a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law. There was no way I was going to wrap those two pair up and give as a gift. I had to go to a local variety shop and purchase two pair of Green Ape gloves to replace those purchased via Amazon."
3,"Young women, weirdo creeps, and 60's New York... what a package!","Amazon's description, and the accompanying customer reviews, pretty much hit the mark: Both ""Bad Girls Go To Hell"" and ""Another Day, Another Man"" sport amateurish production values, frequent lapses in visual and thematic coherence, and a strange fascination with inanimate objects such as potted plants and third-rate framed artwork. Yet, as most of the comments here also point out, there is also an undeniable power and attraction at work here, a kind of compelling, dreamlike quality that keeps one's attention. Of course, the numerous women lounging around in lingerie and body stockings in both films might have something to do with the movies' hold over viewers. Both movies feature surprisingly clean, sharp prints, and like most other Something Weird releases, this DVD also has numerous bonus features including trailers, short subjects, and promotional artwork."
1,Bad Girls Go to Hell,"The product was damaged from the moment we opened it. It was represented as ""new"" when we made the purchase. New doesn't come damaged with deep and multiple scratches."
1,RERELEASE DOESN'T WORK,"At this writing, Amazon is listing this as the rare, OOP 2000 edition, but it is actually the 2011 edition. Even worse, there is no way (at least that I can figure out) to play the two movies! You can select ""trailers"" or ""special features,"" but clicking on the movie titles themselves does nothing. Very strange."
2,On second thought!,"Hi everybody! I really trashed this movie when I first viewed and reviewed it. After leaving it on the shelf for over a year I decided to try again and I admit that I may have been a little too harsh in my criticism the first time. I'm still disappointed that it failed to live up to the hype but this movie DVD does have some redeeming qualities, especially if you start it at the beginning and watch it all the way through as if you were at a drive in theater. I didn't do that the first time, I just watched the two featured movies and skipped the ""extras"". The trailers from other Doris Wishman movies were very good and I plan to buy some of them when they finally come out on DVD. Now that I've seen Gigi Darlene and Darlene Bennett in the ""Olga"" movies and other movies I can better appreciate them in these movies. I decided to write a second review rather than ""edit"" my previous one so that you can still use it. Good luck and thanks!"
5,So far it's good...,"So far so good. My husband and I were entertained. I used to watch LOST up until I got tired of it a few seasons in... he watched it till the end and loved it. He also loves Fringe so I though this would be a good fit. We will continue to watch. Missed the pilot on TV so decided to download thru Amazon instant video- very happy w/the HD quality and speed of download. When we first hit play, the audio didn't match the actors mouths, so we hit pause and play and it was all good. Using a Roku for viewing."
3,Doesn't Hang Together,The plot seemed too contrived and motivations were not believable. Characters were ok.. Had a tough time time caring about what will happen.
2,Weak,"Plot is semi-interesting, but the scripts of the first two episodes are full of cliches, weak acting, bad dialogue... Consider the pro forma flashback of the blond cop's attempt to save her partner's life, the pro forma pep talk her captain delivers, the tired business about how ""we have to get past this"" and ""it's not your fault,"" all of it canned and unoriginal, just zipped through like a chore on the script's to-do list. If you had lost your partner that way--really watched him die, tried to save him and failed--would your responses and those around you be nothing but canned bromides? In real life, when people say the dumb things they know they shouldn't, what you say when you can't think of what to say or do, they say those dumb things in different ways because they're different people. Here we have people reading off flash cards. What happened didn't happen to them, it happened to the script. You have to feel sorry for the script."
4,No Resolutions!,"Phooey! I just got really interested in this story line and now find that the series was not continued. So we don't know who, when, what, where, or why. Bummer.But I have enjoyed the episodes that are available. JJ Abrams has some fantastic ideas."
2,After Watching 27 minutes...,"I got fed up with the cliches and violence. Since the other reviews rate this highly, I'll go back an watch a bit more. Sci Fi has to walk a fine line to get enough teenage viewers, and still be thoughtful enough for the older SF fan.-later-At least through episode 2, the writing and characters are weak (for me.) I'd _like_ to like it, but...Be sure to look at the non-hd version to see more reviews. I hope Amazon figures out how to put hd and non-hd versions' customer reviews together. Where do I make that suggestion?"
2,Couldn't get into this show,Sorry I just could not get into this. I'm not one for unrealistic shows. Just too unreal for me. And at most I can say I gave this a shot.
1,Why oh why?,"Really...this show was not all that interesting to begin with, then to put out a set at this price for a show that was going and never ended up going anywhere. Why? Why would someone waste their hard-earned money on this? Sure...I enjoy watching Jorge Garcia in just about anything, but the supporting cast is what kills the series for me...especially the female lead who was much too much like Jodi Foster. Ugh."
1,well it's OVER,"they cancelled it, so why bother watching? thanks Fox. Thanks Amazon for this prime ""gift""I wanted to watch this until I found out it had been cancelled. Kinda takes away the excitement doesn't it? I hate it when Fox cancel shows without giving them a chance..."
4,Fox has a winner in Alcatraz,"Pilot & Ernest Cobb [HD] came quietly to Fox just after the first of 2012. By the time I got around to watching the show for the first time, the pilot and 3 other shows had aired. I knew that I missed some of the critical explanation as to what was happening week to week, so I searched out and purchased the first few shows to have a better understanding of the series.If you missed the pilot, then be sure go to Amazon.com and purchased it, as it makes the entire series much more understandable."
4,Good episode with less graphic killing,"This episode is clearly about a child kidnapper/killer from 1963 on the loose in today's world. It has some very interesting character developments with Doc Soto in it. And there's not a lot of graphic killing in it, which there is in some of the other episodes of the series. I do, however, encourage watching this series in order as a couple of scenes in it deal directly with events from the previous episode so the second half of Episode 1 from Amazon should be watched first."
5,My husband loves this,"This is a show that was a different concept.Everyone from alcatraz is missing for something like 40 or 50 years, then one by one tthey start showing up again, but they haven't aged, and if they were bad before they still are now.Sorry that this series was cacelled."
5,AMAZEBALLS!!!,A total twist and action packed series along with puzzles and mysteries. It's amazing in my book!!!! and it was worth the purchases!!!
5,Excellent Condition,Thanks was looking forward to it. Its a bummer that this series wasn't given more time to develop on FOX.
5,Great Service,"Fast delivery, well packed, all round great service. Would recommend and use again.Great series, I only got to see the first 4 shows so was very happy to receive the series for Christmas."
5,Alcatraz,"This was a TV show that was missed, maybe becuase of time slot or day. It keeps you guessing and wanting more. So sad the series was cancelled."
5,Fantastic series,"I have enjoyed watching season 1. Cannot wait until season 2. Thirlling, exciting, good twist and turns in the plot."
5,"REALLY,,, You CAN pass gallstones without having surgery!","My father in law did it first and passed a half of a jar! I decided to do it and I didn't pass that many but passed about 60ish pea size ones and 10 or so larger ones. I was having chest pain associated with having gallstones and had been told I'd have to get surgery...but this helped me avoid surgery. It's real people. I didn't know if it was until I tried it and now-I believe! I am sooooo thankful for this book and the knowledge in it! Very helpful. However, it doesn't tell you how to eat the day after...eat veggie diet for a couple days after AND take it easy, don't do any heavy lifting. I learned that the hard way. You gotta understand the gallbladder and ducts just passed large stones and the ducts were stretched...give it time to get back to normal."
5,Groovy 70's Spanish Music,"I became intrigued with this style of music after watching ""Eres mi heroe"" and really like the soundtrack to the film. This CD (track 12) contains a song from that film called ""Acalorado"". The track listing on this Amazon page differs slightly from what is on the actual CD. The tracks are: 1. Un Rayo de Sol (Fernando); 2. Cantar y Contar (Again and Again); 3. Nina de Papa (L'Olympia); 4. En Ti Lo Encontre; 5. Mi Talisman; 6. Fin de Semana; 7. Oh, Oh July; 8. Rosana; 9. Lazos de Amistad; 10. Manda Christmas; 11. Un Gramo de Flicidad; 12. Acalorado.If you like this CD you'll enjoy the group Mocedades as well."
1,THERE NOT THE REAL DIABLOS,"THE REAL DIABLOS ARE A GROUP FROM RIVERSIDE CA, THIS IS JUST... FROM SPAIN, LOS DIABLOS SON LOS CHICANOS OLDIES.SO DONT GET MISTAKEN LIKE I DID GET LOS DIABLOS INCOMPARABLES THEY ARE THE BOMB FOR MY OLDIES COLLECTION."
5,Great BBQ Sauce,"I was excited to find this BBQ sauce online. I had previously bought it from a small country store in upstate New York and could only get it when I visited relatives. This is my dad's favorite and is a staple for Christmas, his birthday and Father's Day. The seller was great too! He called to tell me when he was shipping the package, so I could keep an eye out for it. Will order again!"
3,functional,"I like this shower caddy because it holds a lot of stuff. However I could not get it to stay on my shower head, it kept slipping off. I had to hang it on the towel rod in my shower. Also, it would not fit over my shower door since the hooks are on the small side"
1,Useless item,"i bought this item from amazon and it was delivered on time. I set it up in the bathroom and discover it has two hook to hang the product which make it difficult because one hook was steady and the other hook kept sliding off making it unstable. To make matter worst the hooks are connected by a flimsy chain which snapped off. unforntunatly because the product need two hooks to stay up not one the product became useless.Very bad purchase, believe me do not waste your money go to a dept store and get it for cheaper."
5,Best caddy ever,"Awesome caddy. Been using it for two weeks. The product was packaged very nicely. It comes with suction cups as well. I hang mine over the shower curtain railing so I don't use the suction cups. The hooks have rubber grips, so it's really sturdy (the caddy doesn't move or swing every time I open and close my shower curtain). The chain looks like it's not going to be sturdy, but it actually is. The baskets are made of plastic and it has holes on the bottom so water doesn't retain inside. In terms of how much it holds, it holds a lot. I am a chick who uses a lot of products and everything fits, so I love that. And the price? Well worth it!"
5,Great for glass showers!,I have a glass shower with no shelving and use this with ease! I just hang it over the top of my shower wall and use the suction cups on the back of each cubby to keep it from wriggling around! The bottoms of each cubby have holes to drain so you dont have to worry about water collecting. Each cubby holds 5-6 full sized bottles :)
4,Umbra Bask 3-Basket Shower Caddy,"Holds quite a bit of weight. I really like it. Very good product. I use it hanging on the towel rack in the bath tub and works perfect for kids toys, shampoo, etc."
3,I really wanted to like this...,"This caddy was great, for the one week it lasted. It was not as strong as I had anticipated. Maybe we exceeded the weight limit with our shampoo bottles, but the chain snapped right in half. I really wanted to love it too :/"
2,Overpriced & holds only few items,"I paid $16.98 for this Umbra shower caddy. I believe you can get something similar if not a little bigger and cheaper elsewhere (ie: Ross, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory). I wanted something that I can place either in shower or on a door hook... for now it is place in the latter. This is what it holds for me: Top basket -3 washcloths, travel size baby wipes; Middle rack -Comet cleaner & Lysol spray; Bottom rack -a handful of plastic grocery bags that I use as trash bags. I don't plan to return this though, not worth the trouble."
5,Perfect,"This item arrived in just a few days, in spite of what it says on the Amazon site about shipping in a week (and then once I ordered on about February 14, a notice that said it would arrive between Feb 24 and March 1). I have a clawfoot tub with a hand-held shower head and no place to put a conventional caddy. This works perfectly, as I can put it anywhere on the shower curtain bar that encircles the tub."
3,Functional but didn't fit my space,I received this product yesterday and was excited to get it in the shower so I could get all of the shampoo bottles and other items off the shower floor. I was immediately disappointment because when I hung it on the showerhead the last basket hung down too low and blocked the knobs on my shower. I suppose this is my fault for not looking at the dimensions of the product and measuring the distance between the showerhead and knobs. I ended up hanging it over the shower door. I am not overly found of this set up because I am worried that it might not stay in place when the shower door gets opened and closed. This is a functional product and easily holds all my stuff. Buyer beware and measure your space before you buy.
2,"Huge Bulge, not good!","I purchased this & returned it, because I was using with a shower curtain. My sons shower wouldn't hold anything, everything slid off and I didn't want to put a corner organizer pole thing in there. So I went with this. Let me just say, if you're using with a shower doo this item would be perfect. With a shower curtain, however, this item sticks out & creates a big bulge when your curtain is closed or open rather. When you walk into your bathroom all you see is this huge bulge in your shower curtain, if you use to it's fullest potential. Meaning I had big, heavy bottles of shampoo inside of this organizer. I'm picky so this didn't cut it for me. If you purchase this with the use of a shower curtain you will see what I am referring to. If you're as picky as some about the way their house looks, you won't like it."
4,Works just fine..,I got this as a gift off my wish list. It fits perfectly in a glass shower and from afar it looks built in because the chain is barely visible. The best thing is that you can hang it wherever - it does not limit you like most shower caddies.
1,Quality has gotten worse,I recently purchased this caddy and have been using it for about a month in my shower. The chain has rusted already. I have to see if I can return it.I also purchased the exact caddy about a year ago and that one has NOT rusted so far. Not sure what kind of metal is now being used to make the chain.I am disappointed the chain is rusting. The caddy itself is great. Too bad.
2,Not happy,Should've come fully assembled and didn't--next to impossible to remedy. Very difficult to adjust length of chain. Not worth the extra money as price went up and $7 s+h increased it. Seller wouldn't pay return s+h for defective product.
4,"It works as it should, but is expensive","I am not sure why this particular type of mantle is so difficult to find. I have used several types of gas lanterns in the past and this has been the most difficult and expensive replacement out there. It's either priced high with free shipping, or cheap with a $5 shipping tag per 2-pack ordered Unfortunately, it's the only way to get the F1 Exponent Coleman lantern to work."
4,Coleman Lantern Accessories,We purchased this as a replacement part for our lantern. We received it in just a few days and are satisfied withthe product.
5,Good Item,Well I ordered these because I was having a hard time finging them anywhere. Found out they were at the old Walmart I worked at some time ago. Now I have enough for my life time.
5,hip and sophisticated,"""Highballs High Heels"" is what it says: a smart, witty cocktail guide for girls (and the authors mean anyone female, not just the young 'uns). I own this book and ""Atomic Cocktails"" by the same writers, and both are terrific, but ""Highballs"" is funkier and less basic, though still very easy to use. ""Highballs"" is not exclusively for women, but then, neither is ""When Harry Met Sally""- it's just unlikely that men will have the same appreciation for these that we do. With recipes like Minivan Mom Meltdown Mixer and Shirley Temple's Evil Twin, these recipes are as much fun to read as they are to make. The graphics are so cool that it practically qualifies as a coffee-table book. ""Highballs in High Heels"" is now the first book I grab when I have the yen for a cocktail- you really can't go wrong."
1,schulman is an attention-grabbing idiot.,"this is insane, simply put. there may be similarities between her book 'people in trouble' (read it, and it isn't as great as some of the other reviewers make it out to be), and RENT (the best show ever to come to broadway), but if you think about it, there's no way. jonathan larson based RENT off of la boheme and his own life, not some cheap book he probably had never even heard of. and the man died, for christ's sake! even if this is true, larson deserves more respect than to be yelled at by a person desperate for attention who has nothing better to do than accuse other people to find recognition. this book isn't even worth glancing at."
2,The Book Remains Weak,"I submitted a previous review of the book (giving it two stars) and, in the spirit of fairness, reviewed the work again recently.I stand by my previous conclusion: I feel that there is a considerable amount of creativity as well as genuine orginality in Schulman's work (hence two stars and not none)... but I find it a pity that she doesn't develop her thoughts further and that she meanders from point to point.I am not a white male, as a subsequent reviewer has suggested. I am a male who is a person of color. I resent the dispelling of my viewpoint because it disagrees with that of other reviewers, particularly on the grounds of some putative inherent gender/race difference.Schulman's fan appear to share a weakness with Schulman (at least the Schulman who wrote Stagestruck) -- the predilection to assert supposed truths without developing the given thought further. Saying something forcefully doesn't necessarily make it true...rjnjm@yahoo.com"
1,what a load of trollop,"it's so sad that this book has become a reality. i feel sad for sarah schulman for her mistaken beliefs about jonathan larson. she has spent a lot of energy on this. jon did not plagirize rent, plain and simple. as someone who has had intimate knowledge of his working process, i can tell you that this show came from his heart, and it finally broke his heart. how wrong to speak out against someone who cannot stand up for himself."
1,A Revisit,"I read and reviewed this book a while back, but more recently I actually found and bought a copy of Shulman's novel ""People in Trouble,"" while working on a chapter about Rent for a book of my own. While I enjoyed the novel to some extent, it's only slightly above average and I really could see no similarities between Rent and People in Trouble, other than the coincidences that are inevitable from the two books being set in similar times and places. Since the similarity between the two is the basis for Stage Struck, I find this book even more worthless than I did before. Having now compared the two works for myself, I now have even less respect for Shulman, and am even more convinced that this book (Stage Struck) is nothing more than an excuse for a rant and a way to cash in on someone else's success."
4,Entertaining and Cathartic,"Also, as I've come to expect with her books, Ms. Schulman manages to find the words to explain things I've always sensed but not been able to articulate. The section on marketing to gays (who, as she puts it, are still struggling with post-traumatic stress as a result of being raised in this society) was brilliant, and funny. An instance where she really stopped me in my tracks: when she compared gays and lesbians to a older relative of hers who was freed from a Nazi concentration camp and shortly afterwards had a small breakdown when trying to choose what color drinking glass to buy from a shelf of glassware that came in too many colors, sizes and shapes."
1,I don't see the connection,"Having read ""People in Trouble"", I can't see how her book was used as a basis for RENT. Without that connection, the thesis of this book falls apart. She seems to be angry that a straight male wrote a hit play with gay charcters."
4,"Powerful anti-anxiety herb, also treats babesiosis. Lyme patients should love holy basil!","Started taking this in capsule form for lyme-induced anxiety/restless leg syndrome and BAM- got hit with a herx reaction (that's actually a good thing). I researched it further, and saw that it is a powerful anti-malarial herb as well. Aha! Anti-malarials treat my lyme coinfection (babesiosis), so this wonderful herb was killing babesiosis bugs well enough to cause a herx! Bonus! I came here and ordered these drops, so I could better control the dosage (which was hard to do with a capsule). Now I am using it to control anxiety and the disease itself. Holy basil has benefits a mile long.... do some Googling and see for yourself. You will probably end up ordering it :-) Gaia is a great brand, too."
1,"Dumb, Raciest","Its a pretty low-class documentary. Just some stoner kids who hate mexicans trying to explain why they hate them. Im not pro or against immigration, I am against lame documentary however. And this one is not informative or entertaining.Waste of time."
5,The Bible for any Columbo fan,"The indispensable guide to America's greatest television detective, ""The Columbo Phile"" is a must-have for any fan. It includes detailed episode summaries, behind-the-scenes production information, and interviews with many of the guest murders including Leonard Nimoy, Richard Kiley and Robert Conrad. The writers, creators, and directors are all heard from, and there are extensive quotes from Peter Falk himself that show just how much he cared about the character and the series.The book details the original run of Columbo episodes, beginning with the made-for-TV movie ""Prescription: Murder"" and ending with ""The Conspirators."" Although the 1980's revival (beginning with ""Columbo Goes to the Guillotine"" and ending in the 2000's with ""Columbo Likes the Nightlife"") is mentioned, the book was published before any of the new episodes aired, so information on them is not included.Whatever price you can find it at is well worth it!"
4,"Please, please publish an updated edition!","This fine book shows just the sort of attention to detail the great detective would appreciate. It is a work of love, and is a good read for any fan of Columbo. The only problem is that the book is a little out of date now - well over a dozen episodes have screened since the last one listed. A new edition is in order. Please, please, give us the REST of the story!"
5,The best and only Columbo source,"This is a fine book - I've read it cover-to-cover. It's all you need if you are interested in the fumbling, bumbling ways of this great detective.I hope that Mark Dawidziak revises it someday to include the newer additions to the Columbo saga."
5,Good deal,book was everything the description said! I was well pleased and cannot complain at all! Yup thats all i have to say about this product
5,A good curl up with a good book type mystery,"A very well written mystery about a murder in a prison. The characters are well development.The reader can identify with T.P. He is not 20 something; he is grown with grown children; making tough decision about life and the foods he eats.The writer deftly describes the harshness of prison life without writing about all the brutality that we all know occurs. Bravo, he did not sugar coat the prison or the prisoners, he merely did not mention the brutality or depravity.It was intriguing reading about the lack of clues and the little ity bity clues that finally started showing up. Until that last clue (I'm not telling-read the book) you really have no idea who the murderer could be.Great whodunit. I love a good mystery.I am recommending the book to my bookclub, In the Company of My Sistahs, (Northern California)."
3,To Solve a Murder...,"The Weight Pile Murder was a slow going novel. Set in a prison backdrop the main character Lt. Price races against the clock to solve a murder before his retirement commences. The interrogation begins, facts unravel and he engages in a fact finding mission that has earned him the reputation as a no holds-barred investigator. Mr. Benson tells the story in such explicit detail that you emerge feeling like you've partaken of the correctional experience. If you like a real edge of the seat murder mystery, then check out the first of his series of murder mysteries.A Prolific Writers Network Reviewer"
4,Zany fun.,"**** Emily's European odyssey is over, but her adventures have really only just begun. Since her return home, she's had to cope with her best friend, Dru's, upcoming wedding to Felix, handling via email her other best friend's depression, a long distance love affair (sort of, only without carnality), with Fang, finding she has another spook, winning a cruise from a time share, and dealt with her dad's mid- life depression. Through it all, Emily may not keep smiling, but she does keep her fans smiling, no giggling. Science has proven that happiness and laughter are on a par with vitamin pills for health enhancement, and are much easier to swallow. So, my advice for your continued well being is to stay current with Emily's latest adventures. They are so zany, they might really have happened. ****"
3,Utilitarian,"This vacuum is a fairly bare-bones unit. Like many lower cost units it has a rather short hose so you may have a hard time reaching areas. Also, the head of the vacuum continues to spin even when in the upright position.It does have a nice sturdy feel and a powerful suction."
5,Nice & Easy,"Couldn't beat it for the price or ease of use. Easy to take the java feed coming out of it and plug it in to other web pages with a simple piece of code (just look at the source in the java view mode). Doesn't like all ethernet cords. Some seem to not make contact well unless you push them in all the way and then sometimes they lose connection after a day or so and need to be pushed back in a little more but, this is only with 1 or 2 cables that I tried."
4,Nice IP Camera for the Price. Good Web Interface,"I bought this camera based on the reviews, so figure I better do my part. The camera is pretty easy to set up. If my router had the default IP configs, it would have been easier. The instructions assume you know your way around networking.Once I got the web interface up, I was able to quickly set things up to do DHCP which greatly simplifies things.The picture is not bad for such a small camera. I have it pointed out the back window in my lakehouse so I can see the weather from home.I DO NOT USE WINDOWS, so I appreciated that a few reviewers stated that this camera had a non-active-X mode. I am sure that the java may slow things down, but it works. I am still trying to get things configured to use the scheduler to upload images to my web site. Not sure what I am doing wrong there.Positive:Good web interface.Good Picture.Java-StreamingPriceNegative:Focusing ring is a little tricky.Instructions for setup assume savvy user.No night vision."
4,Internet camera,Good camera for the money. I purchased this and a Linksys. Came back and purchased another of these and returned the Linksys.This camera has a better image and is easy to use. Only drawback is that it doesn't have a scheduler to let you use it as a motion detector. Linksys had this feature but it reset when you rebooted the computer.
1,Not Mac friendly!,"Although advertised to work with all operating systems, the help line advice from Trendware was to ""find someone with a windows machine"". End of story."
4,A nice thorough job,"This gives a nice overview of Fonteyn's life and career, narrated largely by Dame Margot herself. If you've already read her autobiography, however, this doesn't add up to any new or revealing information. The narration is interspersed with comments from associates like Ninette de Valois, Robert Helpmann, Fred Ashton, ballet critics, etc, and more interestingly (imo) scatterings of film footages of Fonteyn performing over the years. There are short little clips of a '37 television solo, the '62 Giselle with Nureyev (gorgeous -- the performance, I mean), Sleeping Beauty - Rose Adagio, a '66 Ondine, etc, etc.Overall, it's an interesting video. I only wish they'd showed more such footages (or more of the ones they showed) instead of the long shots of Dame Margot narrating.btw, the back cover claims the video si 188 minutes long -- a typo; it's actually 88 minutes long."
2,Outdated thinking,"This book, and others like it, are like the cry of an infant when its parent doesn't come. Applegate basically complains that the universe doesn't agree with his philosophical point of view, and therefore we should ignore the great strides and improvements science has brought about and retreat to our mothers' skirts, tinfoil on our heads. And maybe when we grow up, to assuage the awful feeling of insignificance, we should tell our children reassuring lies that keep their egos on solid ground, instead of letting their intellects soar."
3,"Good Writing, But a Bit Slow For Me...","A slim book entirely dedicated to constructing a portrait of an elderly waiter in a New York restaurant nicknamed Hero. The author sets up the scene at the restaurant as Hero struggles to maintain his dignity amidst a multi-national, multi-ethnic group of younger waiters. Then, tension builds as Hero finds something worth rocking the boat for, and struggles with the meaning of his own existence. The writing is good, but it is too slow and introspective for my tastes."
5,"Brutal, honest and darkly comedic","An engaging and raw story of an aging career waiter taking risks to help a fumbling youth in a hellish compassionless New York kitchen-I couldn't put this book down. An easy and consuming read told with truest humanity, realism and hope."
4,A model of economical storytelling,"This is a hugely accomplished work offering the lean power and tragic vision we remember from Hemingway when we forget how awful he really was most of the time. Hero is the darkly funny and painful account of an alienated waiter at a New York steak house, his brutish colleagues and his heartbreaking brush with salvation. A spare and beautiful first novel that does so much in so little space it's just hard to believe."
3,very cool toy with a poor design,"first of all, don't buy this toy for a child under five. it falls apart easily and small pieces could break off. it's a cool star wars action set, but the pod falls off and the entrance hatch broke off in the first month. the chubby guys that are included couldn;t fit up the ramp anway. chewie is adorable. keep out of reach of fellow star wars fans who might klepto it."
2,She loves it,My daughter was given this toy for Christmas last year and I don't think she has gone one day without playing with it since.
5,best birthday ever!,"we bought this for my son's 4th birthday (who is starwars mad), so far it goes everywhere with him, he loves the sounds the bits that open & light up, whilst the chunky little durable characters are perfect for little 'less than gentle' hands. When we asked if he'd enjoyed his birthday he said it was his best birthday ever because of this present. High praise indeed when he put it above the others toys he got and a big party!!!"
2,Biscuit Joiner Handbook,"As a new user of a biscuit joiner I found about the first 70 of this book's 208 pages somewhat useful, although most of the information prsented I had already read in the Owners Manual provided by the manufacturer of my joiner[Porter Cable]. Most of the book is devoted to a reveiw [with no recommendations] of joiners which were on the market when the book was published in 1995-outdated information.After using my joiner I believe that it is such a wonderfully straightforward tool to use that it would be very difficult to write a book which provides much useful information beyond what you get with your owner's manual."
