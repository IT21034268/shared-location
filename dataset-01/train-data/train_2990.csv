3,"Hardware works fine, but software is cryptic","I've used this to capture video from VHS tapes. The hardware works fine, and has no trouble locking to even a glitchy signal. I'm using generic hardware and Windows XP, and have not had any dropped frames.The MPEG-2 encoding, which allows a variety of bit rates, seems solid as well.On the other hand, the WinTV 6.0 software for capturing video is totally confusing. It took hours of experimentation before I understood it. Does anybody know of other capture software that's compatible with this board?"
2,FAIR,Installed w/o problems however the IR blaster would not work properly thus Media Center would not work without IR. So I shipped it back.
2,If they would send you the right card,I am not the first person to have this problem. What I received was in fact a WinTv-HVR-1600. Which is not at all the same as a WinTV-PVR-150 because it does not have Linux drivers. Then I had to go to the trouble of calling Haupauge to get them to switch it out. Had to pay shipping to send them the 150. More than a week went by before I was able to build my MythTV Box.
4,very good card,"Have had this card for about a year now and outside of a known issue of the recording audio being loud (I can live with it)it has been a dynamite tv card for me. I have a shuttle MB (Athlon 2.6Ghz)1Gb mem, 120GB HD. I select the TV shows via TitanTV (included - card works directly with it), it records it to the HD, then I watch it on my TV via my GoVideo network DVD player. If I don't want the commercials in the recording I edit them out with VideoRedo Plus. Works very sweet indeed...."
2,Not user-friendly,This is quite difficult to configure. Can't get it to work with my TV - and I already have a PC connected to it.
2,Piece Of Junk,"The performance of this card is poor at best. Some channels that are fine on my TV are either snowy or have ghosts, and also the sound is either broken up or non existent on these channels. A search on a dedicated newsgroup turned up numerous complaints on these issues but no fix. Tech support at Happauge does not respond to my e-mails except for an automated reply with a link to the newsgroup. I strongly suggest checking out the newsgroup before you buy this pig.http://www.shspvr.com/forum/index.php"
4,why 4 stars,This is a good tv card all around the tv quality is very very good the only thing that I don't like is that it won't record direct to dvd from the external imput you have to save it to a file than copy to the dvd this will not act as a video capture card if you want to put your home vhs or cam corder on a dvd. You have to save it in mpeg format first.
4,Works well,"After installing the card, I booted up my Windows XP and it locked up. After rebooting again, however, the card worked fine and has continued to work fine.I've only had the card for two days, and so far I am very happy with it. Here's my setup: Windows XP Home Edition, Direct TV set-top box, and a standard cable from the set-top box into the card. Since the set-top box is in the other room, I'm just using the set-top box remote to set it on the right channel. A little tedious, but it's fine for recording a few shows. I haven't tried the remote that came with the card (I assume it doesn't work through walls).The WinTV 2000 software is not very user friendly, but I haven't found any bugs in it yet.I chose not to install the software and drivers from the CD. Instead, I downloaded all of the latest versions directly from the manufacturer's web site."
1,Be very Careful,"Hauppauge packaged their HVR 1600 in the WinTv 150 PVR box that I bought from Amazon. The HVR is a newer product that I could not get to work, especially the VHS taping part. The point is I did not order the HVR 1600, but it was sent in the correct box. THis has put a damper on my buying from Hauppauge and Amazon. I sent it back. We'll see if Amazon gives me a refund.JR"
1,Did not work,"I installed this card in my PC and the computer would not even boot up. I took it out and it worked fine. Tried putting it back in and all I got was a black screen. Tech support was terrible. After three days the only answer they could give me was ""it's either a bad card or I need to update my bios. No help at all. Good thing I bought from Amazon as I returned it and got my money back."
4,PVR hardware for use with Linux,"Very good card for using with Linux & KnoppMyth. Unlike the AVerMedia cards, it was detected right away, and worked without having to re-do things. Playback quality is very good, but I would suggest a SATA-II drive if you are going to watch a recording whilst recording another."
5,Great card!,"This thing is great. All channels are clear, sound is great. Check out GB-PVR, its a free pvr software. The interface is easy to use, seting up recordings is simple and intuitive. If you get a bad picture, you might have a dud card. RMA it, for a new card."
1,Cannot receive digital over-the-air signals,"Just a word of caution. This is an analog device. It was probably pretty decent back in the day. I didn't try hooking up a VCR or other device to it. However, if you were hoping to attach an antenna and be able to use it to capture video from over-the-air broadcasts, think again. You cannot. If you want to hook up your existing cable TV to it and record to your PC's hard drive, it will probably do the trick."
5,Great product! Use it with Linux DVR MythTV.,Great reliable product made even better when combined with the open-source MythTV DVR project. Highly recommended item for capturing analog video.
3,WinTV-PVR-150,Pros:Installed easilyGood software bundleCons:Audio quality sometimes poorRemote control sometimes finicky
4,long lost advantix film - great find,"product arrived quickly and in perfect condition (new in package) -- loaded perfectly into my 35MM camera, and hopefully i can locate a vendor to process this ""FILM"" properly. Glad to know this type of film is still available, but very difficult to locate, since everyone has gone digital when taking photographs (so sad, but that's progress)."
5,Hard-to-Find-Film,"A wonderful purchase of a product that I can no longer find in my local stores. My Dad also has a camera that uses this type of film, and was very happy I was able to share this purchase with him. Great service also, and I would definitely purchase again."
1,Bad Film,I purchased many rolls awhile ago. When pics were developed it was clear the film is bad/old. Don't waste your money.
4,Film Gift,This was a gift for my sister and she still hasn't had it processed or even taken a whole roll as far as I know. Such a shame!
1,advantix 400,flim kodak advantix 400 would not work they came out red .they did not delvop clear pictures.not good bennie taylor
4,Purchased film for a friend,I purchased the Kodak Advantix 400 speed film for a friend who still uses film in his camera. I cannot convince him to upgrade to a digital camera. I was glad to find the film available through Amazon.com. Thank you
1,MTA TRADING CHEATS AND LIES,"Sent me open film they claimed was new-said they took the back off for the coupon...SOLD OUTDATED FILM....Lost vacation pictures that cannot be replaced..I sent them the film back and ruined photos-they said they would reimburse me ---5 months later NOTHING...DO NOT BUY FROM THEM,,AND AMAZON SAYS THEY ARENT RESPONSIBLE..Stick with ebay at least you can get disputes resolved..."
1,Outdated Film,Film had been removed from original manifactor packaging along with expiration date. Film received was outdated single opened containers of outdated film.
5,Great,This CD is the BEST CD I have EVER bought! I recommend it to EVERYONE who is wanting something new!
4,"FOR THE MOST PART, GOOD","Although Apocalyptica's Inquisition Symphony has several more tracks that I like (and I rated it 5 stars), Cult has my absolute favorite track. Ever heard of ""Hall of the Mountain King""? It's a classical piece. You heard it if you saw the movie ""Rat Race"". Apocalyptica's version starts out LOUD, then gets quiet, almost as if you were listening to the original, then, at 1:03, the music suddenly gets louder and faster at the same time, almost as if the band were thinking to themselves, ""man, this song is too slow, let's kick it up a notch!""My other two favorites on this Cd are ""Until it Sleeps"" and ""Path"". Regular ""Path"" is just with the cellos, which is what I prefer, because it really is an excellent track. ""Path Vol 2"" with Sandra Nasic is the same song, only they add lyrics and it's harder to hear the cellos in the background.Overall, this is a really good CD, and I certainly look forward to their future works."
2,Big brother style CD encryption? Check.,"Now, don't get me wrong, the music contained on the CD is stellar. Top notch. From what I've been able to hear, it's really great.My problem is with the CD itself and the encryption used on it. When I plugged it into my Windows machine and attempted to play it using WinAmp, there were no files detected on the CD. Curious, I chose to explore the CD to see what was the matter. And I found a grand total of 3 files. I tried disabling AutoPlay, and still have this issue. The CD will play if I use Windows Media Player, but I find that that particular player cuts out partway through songs, won't play the disk from start to finish, and it uses up too much resource to leave it running in the background.I find this extremely distasteful and have grown quite upset with the CD itself. I won't be purchasing anything more from this band if this is how they're going to encrypt their products, despite how good their music is."
5,Great backup,"I used it to create back-up for my basement sump pumps (3 pumps with 30Amps total power). Connected with 3 110 Ah Farm and fleet deep cycle batteries. Works perfectly and able to handle full load for significant amount of time. Consider connecting basement freezers and refrigerators to it as well and probably servers. Why to pay for useless 12 V backup pumps (they handle max 2000gal/h each), when you can connect your regular pumps through this charger/converter."
1,Missing Figures in Kindle Edition,This review is for the Kindle edition only. I have purchased two prior hard cover editions of this book and looked forward to the 7th edition on my Kindle and iPad. The Kindle edition is missing some of the figures in several of the chapters. I confirmed this on my Mac as well. Editor needs to fix this.
2,Still missing figures from chapters 5 and 6,"This is a great book - I have most editions, but the Kindle edition, which i was looking forward to is still missing the figures from two chapters. Most of the rest are here, and I can probably look them up in the earlier editions, but it shouldn't be this way."
2,Kindle version missing a lot of figures,"This is a review of the Kindle version. The text content of the book is excellent (5 stars) for understanding radiobiology, but there are multiple chapters that are missing all of the figures or some of the figures. Having the electronic version is great for being able to highlight sections and for doing word searches, but a substantial part of the content involves the figures, which for the most part are missing in this electronic version. I had to bug other students to photocopy all of the missing figures, which I continually found as I read new chapters. The publisher really needs to set this straight, especially since the Kindle book is as expensive as the print version. This does a great disservice to an otherwise excellent text. I would rate this as a 5-star if the publisher fixes this problem, and until then would recommend you get the print version or be prepared to borrow for photocopying from classmates."
4,Radiobiology for the Raoiologist meets your needs,"Well, I bought this because I was required to for school. I think that's really the only reason why anyone would. I suppose it would provide insight for practicing radiologists, and it does bring the subject together well, but you probably are only going to buy this book when you are required to."
4,Used textbook on Radibiology,"I wanted to buy the well-known textbook on Radiobiology. The new edition was expensive for me and I've decided to buy the used one. The book explains the basic principles, important experimental results and approaches used in Radiobiology. If you consider a career in Medical Physics, I would recommend to have this book on your bookshelf."
3,Ok,"CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS, BUT NOTHING PLOT-RELATED:I thought this was an ok book. I don't really care for the main female character. I think she's too boy-crazy and immature for my liking. I would have like to have seen a strong, female lead who wasn't packing fancy clothes to take along the trail with her! That scene really aggravated me. She puts on this show that she's strong, and does things like shoots a man, but then becomes a simpering young fool around the men. I hate that about her.Other than that it's a good story. It's a quick read for me between other things...this is the third time I've read it, so it can't be all that bad :)"
5,excellent book,"This was an excellent book and I recommend this book to anyone who wants a bit of spicy romance, and adventure. I loved Susan's cocky and witty personality. All the characters are extremely interesting and the humor is funny. You'd love Clay Carmer, the Texas cowboy and how he saves Susan from being raped. Please you HAVE to read this book!"
5,McGard 24538 Chrome seat wheel locks,These were great and worked perfect. I did not use the locks for my wheels on the vehicle yet but did use One on the spare tire right away. Very pleased with the set of 5.
5,"Same as Mopar it appears, why pay more? Great Product.","Hard to write a long review on lug nuts of course!They are great, just order them. Appears to be 100% the same as Mopar part. Fits 2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon."
2,Disappointing,I think this book's success is because people are blinded by O'Reilly's reputation. They do produce excellent UNIX books but this one is nothing special. Lots of useless charts --- TONS of useless charts -- but otherwise pretty dim.
2,Expensive,Be careful! What seems to be a good price is actually not. You must have another $120 item to make this work.
4,Grooves,"Organic is the key word in this compilation, lots of heady goodness for all the seekers. If you are looking for a sampler of some fine jazz and funk with a mellow earthy feel, hook up with Organic Grooves"
1,Poor man's electric guitar made of plywood,"First, the strings it comes with are awful, but, that is obviously replacable. The guitar is made of plywood, which is extremely cheap and unreliable. The guitar will get out tune very quickly and, if you're a beginner, this can be more trouble than it's worth b/c you'll need to break out the tuner every time you want to play. I believe I was greatly mislead by the other reviews on this product and I'm disappointed that no one has been blatantly honest. My wake up call occured when I went to take a lesson and the instructor asked where I got the guitar and how much I paid for it. He laughed and expressed that for 50 more bucks I could've had a much better guitar (nothing crazy, but much better). Long story short: You get what you pay for! Even if you're a beginner, I would honestly recommened not buying this guitar."
4,Smooth and Chunky,"I bought this guitar for a friend who is starting out. I expected to get it home and tweek it but it was already tweeked. String Action was great and it played real smooth. I am an old 80's hair band guitarist and have owned a ton of guitars over the years. This guitar is a clear 6 on the grand scale of everything I have played. And that includes a USA Kramer I had for years. It is a great Metal guitar in the bridge position and the neck pick up gives you that compressed nasal sound for the old flash runs. I like the feel of the neck better then my Gibson Studio. For two finger bar chord rock and roll, this is your axe."
3,Simplistic,"This book focuses heavily on evolution and ecological principles (hence the title). Often the information is broad and simplistic and applies to other organisms besides microbes; great for begginers, not so much for current microbial ecologists."
2,used 'as good as new' severely damaged,This book had all kinds of underlining with a yellow highlight marker. This is unacceptable for a used book that is 'as good as new'
1,Unsatisfied with the product,"I bought this product on May 17, 2012. After only two weeks, the wooden leg holder (with the two large circles) had cracked and broken. We had expected this end pin holder to work effectively, as it looked like a very high quality product, but this product did not seem to be worth what we paid for. Including tax, we paid $41.95 for this product, hoping it would work well. Although Everjoy Music Inc. ships this product, Amazon should be responsible for this."
5,A set of practical relationship tools,"In The New Marriage: Transcending The Happily-Ever-After Myth, professional therapists and marriage counselors Linda and Robert Miles competently collaborate to provide couples in both traditional and non-traditional relations a kind of road map and a set of practical relationship tools to effectively make their relationship work by identifying and overcoming emotional problems and deal with the stresses of contemporary life afflicting all marital unions today. Innovative, practical, ""user friendly"", insightful, informative, and occasionally inspiring, The New Marriage is very highly recommended reading for anyone needing assistance in helping to rebuild or strengthen his or her relationship."
3,Acceptable tripod bag,"Pros:- The bag is lightly padded so it's not too bulky while still providing protection.- The material used is durable.- A handy side pocket is provided for small tripod accessories (I store extra feet here).Con:- The zippers are cheaply made and do not look like they'll hold up over time if the user is not extra careful in opening and closing the bag. I expected some ""beefier"" zippers.- Expensive.Overall I like the bag but I am very mindful of the zippers.Good luck!"
1,Cheap generic version,This is my first review and because the product was so far off from what I ordered I had to write this. I have been a long time customer of Amazon for eons and have never had a bad experience with a product until now. This product is not a Manfrotto tripod bag but a cheap generic poor quality type that is not even worth $15. I am sure this must be an oversight on Amazon's part because this is the first time I've ever experienced this from ordering with them. I will be returning this for a full refund.
3,This game becomes some what monotamous,"It starts off well, if you can get past the poor graphics. They have dull feel and Spawn is much to blocky. The game mechanics itself, is also a bit cheap. The Special Manuvers are a little too complicated to be any fun at all(If your able to pull them off that is). The scenery is bland and boring as well. it should have been better. Better music, better gameplay and better graphics.The good thing about the game is the story behind it. And how you have to fight your way from Earth into Hell to do final battle with Maelbolgia. Plenty of enemies to make sure your going isn't easy is even further given heart with the ""Bosses"" you have to face such as Overtkill, Redeemer and others. If you can get past the bad, you may find SOMETHING of value."
2,Sad.....,I love the Comics of spawn and I love the animated series but This Game BITES!The controls are clunky...The graphics I can't really argue about since it came out awhile ago. And this game doesn't really have a story.. You just fight and keep going on to your next destination.Spawn the Eternal is a waste of time.I gave it 2 stars cause Spanws in it and that I enjoyed one boss battle...Don't get this game....If you wanna good spawn game getSpawn:In the Demons handThats all I can say for you.Later
2,Could have been great,"Spawn: The Eternal is a definite description of wasted potential. Before this game came out it looked very promising, but when the long delayed game came out, Spawn fans were rather disappointed. The graphics are very blocky, not to mention Spawn looks like an overgrown ape. The controls are plain old unresponsive, and overall the game feels rushed and unfinished. However, there are some pros, the game has an eerie atmosphere, and the sound is great as well, but the fighting engine when you face off against enemies seems like a joke no one is laughing at. The levels in the Tomb Raider-esque parts of the game look too similar to one another, and once you beat the game you'll never want to play it again, not to mention the ending doesn't solve anything. All in all, hardcore fans of Spawn (like myself) may find a bit of fun in this, but others should steer clear."
2,Spawn:Its not what you think its.,"Spawn is a good movie.But I can't said the same with the game.I'm not telling you not to buy it but the real thing is that is a poor game.It's graphics are under the graphics of games like:Army Men Sarge's Heroes,or Shadow Man,or Spiderman 1.I dont recomend you to buy it really but well is all your decision.THANK'S FOR READ MY REVIEW.Please tell if my review was important for your decision."
5,GREAT DEFRANCO MUSIC,Another great and rare CD of Buddy DeFranco music. This one made in Japan is well worth the price. Excellent
5,Great movie,"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, clearly the best of the Eating Out series (can't wait for Eating Out: The Open Weekend and Eating Out: Drama Camp, both being filmed). The best part is that all the male characters were filled with openly gay male actors. Rebekah Kochan delivers and Mink Stole is awesome as always. Make sure to watch the closing credits all the way to the end for a little surprise (and I'm not just talking about Chris Salvatore (Zack)'s awesome song, It's You).s"
3,gay commedy and cute,Was OK but not as good as the first two. A lot more filty language which I did not appreciate. Could have done a much better job if the writers would have gotten away from the filthy language.
3,A better than average gay movie,"This film works primarily because of the fine comic acting of Rebekah Kochan; she's an absolute hoot! Without her sharp and focussed performance, dropping great one-liners at every turn, the film would have ended up much further down the food chain.Older movie buffs might wonder if all young people like Casey speak in the shallow and glib way they do. Sadly many do, including all the tedious gay references to Madonna and her ilk. In the next breath we are asked to believe that he is looking for a deep relationship; one with more intellectual content. This double standard is present in many pop American films and the truly sad thing is that the characters, and probably the filmmakers, don't seem to see the irony.However, the kid comes good at the end with an effective public speech that wins the man he loves. Also, the film was often funny and not overlong. A plus in this genre."
4,"Eating Out 3 is an amazing film, filed with laughs, and hot steamy action","Eating out 3 was not what I expected. I assumed it was another run of the mill gay featurette, and boy was I wrong. Its filled with laughs, hunks, and alot of drama. A great film for any gay couple to sit down and watch with popcorn"
3,Broke same day,"The same day that my son received this gift, it was dropped from about 18"" and the plastic hinge broke."
2,Nothing Special,"Worn out premise. Unbelieveable characters. The writing is so uneven that I could never get into the flow of the story - even if it had been better. The hint of the secret with the hero just wound up being annoying. Boring, boring, boring. Such a dissapointment."
1,"captivating beginning, but middle to end was a big let-down","this book started strong with some wonderfully descriptive first few chapters, but soon the captivating, almost gothic setting wasn't enough to sustain the story. Victoria's a surprisingly un-likeable, stiff, churlish and nasty-for-the-sake-of-it protagonist who never really warmed up or had any true introspection. She calls Byron out every second for all of his insecurities and faults, but remains tediously blind to her own right to the very end (and the most ironic part of that is that she is the one who needs the personality overhaul, not Byron--who at least had manners and a shred of self-esteem.) by the middle of the book, i was doubting these two had a prayer, and as it went on, i just didn't feel any of the overwhelming sensuality between them the author kept trying to sell me on. i'd pass on this one."
3,"dark, dark gothic",I really wanted to like this book more but have to admit to getting just a little bit bored with some of the extended scenes. One love scene goes on for 30+ pages but it dragged so much that it felt like 60. I do like that the stereotype of the young and innocent heroine gets turned on its head and that the hero isn't endlessly brooding and little else. And I'll not look at a peach crumble quite the same way for a while.
4,This is a very durable & cute toy.,My 15 month old daughter loves looking at pictures of family & friends. I have been using these photo albums since she was as infant but needed to buy more albums because she loves them so much. This is a very durable & cute toy.
5,Family photos,"A perfect soft photo album for a baby to learn to identify family members and/or to see photos of Mommy and Daddy when they are away at work during the day. Holds a small photo on the cover and twelve 4"" x 6"" photos inside; no text, story or pictures inside."
1,Not at all as nice as it looks online,"This looked much nicer and larger online. When I received it, I was very disappointed. It was so small and was packaged in a box that looked like it had seen better days. The ribbon that was supposed to be around the box was all stretched out. I bought this for my nephew (it was on his wish list) and I'm almost embarrassed to give it as a gift. I can't believe that it cost [...] (before tax and shipping). It looks like it's worth @$10!"
4,Cute photo album for very young children,"This is a cute album and I was easily able to print standard-sized photos and insert them, as a gift for one-year-old grandson. It was a hit. Another reviewer commented on the wrinkly character of the plastic pages, and this is accurate. It doesn't hurt too much -- might be more of a problem with glare in strong sunlight, but not in regular use."
4,"Fun, safe album for a baby!","My 12 mo old loves, loves, loves having pictures of our family in this album. We do not see family often and this is a way that she can ""see"" them. She flips the pages and points to family members and she likes grabbing it by the handle. I like this book because you can fit more photos in it than others. The photos are a bit difficult to get in the pages and they do stick a little but for a one year old, it's okay :)."
2,Not too impressed,This is a cute idea but it seems kind of cheaply made. I wouldn't want to pay more than $5 for it.
5,Great product!,"This is a great product! Our little boy (one yr) loves it. We haven't had it long, but it seems to be quite durable. It is easy to put pictures in and change them from time to time. A nice way to have pictures of the extended family so baby can become familiar with them."
1,Kaufman's Shogun Scrolls,"At the time of this review this book has been in print for three years, and has the distinction of being the only book on the little heard of subject. Kaufman apparently uncovered references to the original scrolls while researching the Five Rings and the Art of War. The book is clearly a work of fiction. It does not even feign to be a translation. An 800 year old Shogun text appears out of nowhere and there is just one thin little paperback written about it. Curiously, Kaufman lists no references or bibliography. There is no honor in this Hanshi 10th Dan. Perhaps, he should read the books he was doing research on. So much for Joie code, etcetera."
1,time waster,As others have noted I ordered the incorrect bags too. I was toid to return them for exchange. I did that and received neither exchange nor refund. Annoying. Will get AMEX to refund.
1,Carnival junk,"This item is junk and not a Jakks product. It was made specifically for carnival and crane games and is worth about $1. If my daughter had not been present when I opened it, I would have sent it back. Total garbage. Avoid."
1,Too good to be true,"This Audiovox system looks great, especially for the price... but alas, sometimes you really do get what you pay for. I received a defective player that buzzed like a distant radio station, ALL THE TIME- even when playing CD's. I guess I should had heeded that other guy's advise, I just thought HIS particular one buzzed. Oops."
3,Read It--But...,"Randy Wayne White rocks. Doc Ford does stand as a contemporary heir to John D. McDonald's Travis McGee. (Or maybe as a reinvention of McGee's sidekick, Meyer?) This book, however, is indeed different. Doc is much more incidental to the story. As another reviewer says, it really is an elegy for Florida past. It also reveals a lot of backstory for Doc Ford. And much of what happens here plants seeds for later stories. If you're new to Doc Ford, don't start with this book. If you're a Doc Ford fan, read it with the caveat that it wanders away from your expectations like the Kissimee River once meandered through South Florida."
2,Not up to par with Mr. Whites other Doc Ford novels,"A funny but disappointing Doc Ford book. The first I might add. Don't know where the author was going with this Doc Ford one, but it sure wasn't the caliber of his other Doc Fords. Maybe he should have invented another protagonist for this type story, something on the order of Carl Hiaasen's ridiculous story plots and characters in Florida. Couldn't even finish this one!"
2,Not what I'm used to with Doc Ford,"I have read all but three of Randy's Doc Ford novels and this was the most disappointing. I expected the usual conspiracy/espionage drama which I do enjoy. It was just too much of his uncle and his old Florida crooked ways. Sorry Randy, you missed the boat on this one."
2,A big yawn in the sunshine state,"This book starts slow and decelerates from there. Based on the reviews on the back cover I was expecting a captivating read, what a disappointment.I found the storyline as engrossing as watching the weather channel. I wanted to give it a fair chance, so I read it all the way through. That's 5 hours of my life I'll never get back."
1,Don't bother to buy.,I purchased this two tape set only to find out that tape one was 20 minutes long and tape two was a whopping 26 minutes. I think for the money you would do better to look else where for history.
1,Complete Rip-Off,"This is an amateurish documentary, presented on a single DVD in two chapters. The quality amounts to little more than a school project. At the listed price -- a whopping $89 -- it is a complete rip-off. The sound quality is infuriatingly poor -- badly distorted. Stick with the History Channel special on the the subject -- infinitely better for about one-quarter of the price. Products like this give Amazon a bad name. To be avoided at all costs."
2,Sticky,This left a bit of sticky residue on my face and seemed like a needed a good bit of it to fully tone my face. I'm not sold.
5,Cozy and well made,"If you're looking for a reasonably priced pair of sweatpants that are well made, these are a wise choice. Sturdy elastic at the waist and bottoms, string tie at the waist, and comfy fabric."
5,Great Sweatpants,"After reading several negative reviews of these I was a little hesitant to purchase them as a gift. After receiving them, all fears were extinguished. These were exactly as stated in their description and have washed and worn like iron. Follow the label and you can't go wrong. No troubles here!"
2,too big!,I ordered this brand along with Hanes. Way too big - I didn't think they were true to size. Did not like the waist band. Had a drawstring. . . not my style. Returned for Hanes.
5,lenny if you cant say no,I love this song by lenny!...One of my favortites and Im so happy to find it as a single!....will by from seller agai...definately
3,Unfortunately not possible to read,"This book is only for academics.I have tried to read it several times, but it is a full time job for a couple of weeks. Really. The author is intelligent and wellknown in the field, so it might be worth it. But as a prospective buyer of the book you should know what to expect.With time this book might become a sociology classic, but not before we start seeing other work directly interpreting what is being said in the book. That has not happened yet.There is now a 2nd edition as well. I bought it hoping the language would be clearer. It might be slighly clearer, but there are also changes that add further confusion. It is not clear when the author has changed his opinion from the 1st edition or when he just tries to express himself differently."
5,Great,"I think the album is really great. I really enjoy the song beautiful lovely jesus is so great. Jami recently sang at sunnyvalle babtist church for d-now, and she has a beautiful voice. I look foward to future albums."
4,"Easy reading, scientifically accurate sci fi","I hope Mr McCollum becomes wealthy writing books like these: they are fun and easy to read, and also (speaking as a physics trained guy) they are generally scientifically accurate. Most sci fi books these days make ridiculous mistakes with basic physical laws. Please write more books!"
4,"Very good, very enjoyable, abrupt ending","This was a very enjoyable bit of scifi. Reminds one of some of the old masters of hard scifi. Detailed interaction between the characters. Mostly believable. I have read a couple of the author's other books. This isn't the best, but right up there with them. I did feel in this one the ending was rushed. A bit abrupt. It ties all the needed story lines together okay. But having enjoyed things so far was looking forward to how it all got tidied up. Instead, things got drawn to a close, but it was too quick and not very enjoyable the last few pages."
1,New Formula Gave Me Cysts,"If I were to rate this cream a year and a half ago, I'd give it 5 stars. I used it for 5 years and absolutely loved it. I bought it for my friends as gifts and told everyone about it. But then sometime last year the formula changed and now I get cysts on my face. I was in total denial when it happened that it could be this cream, so I stopped and started using it 4 times to be sure. I know that soy derived ingredients can do this to me as well as Acai. This new formula has both. I did not purchase this from Amazon. I purchased it through Vitamin Cottage."
2,An over-priced moisturizer,"For the price, this doesn't do what's promised. I was hoping I had finally found a moisturizer that would help alleviate some of the sebum production in my skin. This does moisturize well and smells great, but it doesn't help lower the sebum production like it led me to beleive. A decent product, but the same thing can be had for 1/5 the price."
3,not sure about it,"I really wanted to like Mychelle line,its smells fabulous, and i like the stoty behind. I am using the entire line, the first week my skin just glowed, but after i've got all my pores clogged and my skin never looked worst,red pimples on my jawline. Now i just trying to figure out if they would work better separately.i still hope it will work out"
3,"Not heavy enough, inflaming my skin","I really, really wanted to adore this cream -- all natural, vegan, locally-owned, etc. Unfortunately the first few times I put it on my face it immediately caused an all-over reddening (which lasted). It also didn't leave my face feeling at all moisturized -- just as tight and dry as pre-application. Shoot! I don't know whether to try their Revitalizing Night Cream (because I like the company) or try elsewhere. For the record, I am in my early-40s with normal-dry skin, and I live at high altitude. I am religious about sun protection (both zinc-based and a hat)."
5,Been using for 7 years,"I've been using this line for over 7 years now, and while I've tried other day moisturizers out of boredom or curiosity, I always come back to this. Yes this is thicker for an oily skin cream, but it leaves the complexion well hydrated and dewy looking. PUt on a layer of powder afterwards and you'll be set for the day. I never get breakouts from this, or irritation. It's just perfect."
5,Better than previous version,"I used to use this Mychelle pumpkin renew cream in its previous packaging, and I decided to try it again because I needed a new facial lotion. The effect is noticeable compared to several other lotions I've tried recently. My skin is smooth, NOT OILY in appearance, feels good, and helps control breakouts (I have sensitive skin). I'm wondering though, did they reduce the container size (the amount of lotion in the jar) in this redesign? It seems smaller than before. Please leave a comment to this if you happen to know. I highly recommend this product, IF YOU BUY ON AMAZON. The prices in health food stores are often inflated for their own benefit. Amazon is amazing, especially with subscribe and save."
5,GREAT FOR DAY AND NIGHT! NO PERFUMES!,I really like this cream; I use it in the morning after I shower. I prefer using a night cream during the day because I don't like the sunscreen ingredients on my face. I especially like that there's no odor to it. It's nice and thick and lasts a long time. In the morning when I take a shower my face is still moist from one or two days before.
1,SCAM!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,"Upon opening the cream, it was globbed in the container and had a strange consistency, similar to mayonnaise mixed with pudding (strange, I know). I still managed to put this ""cream"" on my face and hope for the best. The result- greasy skin that felt like cheap sunblock stuck on my face. I read the ingredients listing on the package and to my dismay one of the first few ingredients was soybean oil - one of the cheapest oils on the market. Don't waste your money on this product, phony reviews are only there to scam you. Hope this helps."
2,Not for Everyone,"I ran out of my usual ALA based cream by Loving Naturals (excellent product!) and it was temporarily out of stock too. So I searched around for a replacement and found this product by Reviva. Unlike a few other reviews, I did not find that this product was greasy, at all. My skin soaked every last bit of it up leaving no residue as it is more like a gel than a cream. It has an okay scent - a little bit chemically, like baby wipes. I personally did not notice any great difference in the overall appearance of my skin during the week that I used it. I had to stop after a week because this product caused my peri-oral dermatitis to not only flare-up, but provoked one of the worst flare-ups I have ever experienced. Therefore, I would not recommend this product to anyone who has peri-oral dermatitis. (Seriously, the anti-aging cream by Loving Naturals has been amazing in helping my skin look its best.) Otherwise, this product was simply okay."
2,"I like the ingredients, but not this cream.","I bought this brand face cream when I went to a health food store and my favorite cream was out of stock. I have sensitive skin and this cream made me break out. It's too thick and acts more as a night cream then a skin smoother.I love Alpha Lipoic Acid and DMAE, however I would not recommend this product, try Derma e Retexturizing Creme, DMAE- Alpha Lipoic - C-Ester, it's cheaper, and has improved my skin tone soooooo much!!!!"
2,It's got vegetable oil in it.,"I tried this stuff for a few days, and much to my chagrin it's caused my face to break out fairly badly. At least I think it was the cause. I took a look at the ingredients and noticed that vegetable oil was fairly high up on the list- I don't think that helps very much. Only use this if you are not prone to outbreaks or are not sensitive to oils."
5,Trustworthy,"CPU works well, and my system is working without conflicts. The processor was in great condition and exactly as advertised."
1,"Love Dennis Chambers, Hate this album !!","Sorry I wasted my money on this one. I've been listening to fusion since the mid-seventies, and as a drummer myself have appreciated much of Chambers' past work starting with Scofield. But this collection of tunes is virtually unlistenable...particularly the title track. I honestly can't imagine what Dennis was thinking when he cut this one. And it's a shame, because he's one of most amazing drummers ever."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES EVER!,"THIS FIGHTING GAME WAS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED! THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTIVE. THE GAME FEATURES POWERFUL FIGHTERS LIKE EIJI, KAYIN, DUKE, RINGO, AND MORE. THE GAME FEATURES EXCELLENT GRAPHICS, EXCELLENT GAMEPLAY, AND EXCELLENT MOVES. THIS WAS A VERY GOOD GAME AND IF YOU ASK ME, THIS ALMOST MAKES TEKKEN LOOK WACK! ONCE YOU FIND THIS, BUY IT ON SIGHT! FOLLOWED BY THREE MORE TOSHIDEN GAMES."
4,Old but still cool!!!,"Battle Arena Toshinden (BAT) was made in 1995, the same year the PSX was first released. This means that BAT is pretty old and can be kinda hard to find. However I was lucky enough to get a copy still in the original box and with its original instructions ...from Electronics Boutique.Anyway, This game is old but still cool!!! The character graphics are pretty good even when compaired to most of the newer PSX fighters but the backgrounds are a tad plain.The controls are spot-on. You can even control the camera postion!There are eight starting characters (each come in two forms) and two secret characters. Each one has his own variety of moves and special attacks.The sound is fair. Nothing outstanding. Same with the music."
5,A revolutionary game for its time!,"I have nothing but good memories of playing this game as a sophomore in high school. I saved up my Burger King money and bought a PSX on the day it released, along with this game and Ridge Racer. I couldn't believe I was playing this game on my tv at home! It was amazing. Sure, it might not be a 5-star game today, but in 1995 it sure was! Good times!"
5,Quality speakers at a budget price.,"I have owned a pair of Bose 301 speakers for 15 years. They still sound great! They are hooked to a Yamaha A/V receiver that is conservatively rated at 85 watts per channel. I would recommend these speakers to anyone wanting a good pair of speakers without spending a lot of money for them. You can shop around and pay more for speakers, but why waste your time and money. The Bose 301 speakers are durable, sound great, look good and best yet, won't bust your budget. I would recommend these speakers to almost everyone looking for a pair!"
2,Spend your money else where.,"I've owned a pair of Bose 301 for 10 years. At best I would call these mediocre; at worst I'd call them, let's just say I need to pick up after my dog...I've moved them around to different rooms and stereos without finding a home that seemed to work.I'm about to give them to a family member who needs something in the kids game room, that would be about right to match their lack of quality sound.Don't waste your time or money, do your homework, there are much better speakers in the same price range."
2,Don't like puzzles? Not for you,Playing Kileak made me realize too much of some things are bad. Also a game should be hard but not too hard. True the game is fun at first but the levels look too similar and frustration sets in when you can't beat a level. A Must Rent Game!
3,kileak:love it or leave it,"kileak,once i got some clues and hints was a very enjoyable game.actually im still playing it.the object is to go through the different levels and acquire several weapons to ultimately get to the end to defeat the dreaded dr. kim.the graphics are pretty cool and the music sounds like kitaro if you""re familiar with him.right now i""m stuck in the fifth basement and i cant seem to defeat this giant spider.ive searched the web endlessly but cannot find any other hints or clues to help me along,but im still forging ahead."
3,Its ok,"This was one of the first games i purchased for the original Play station... since i'm trying to play it on PS3 I can't save at all. Its looking for the memory card! So, I got pretty far and could not save it!!"
2,You too can write Sci-Fi ...,"By the story the way it's written I COULD WRITE SCI-FI ... in fact all you need to do is know how to WRITE period. I like Robert Duvall in this, not as good as TZ's ""Miniture"" starring Duvall but with the way this material is written ... what can you expect?First, before watching this fastforward the video (or laser disc, like I have) for 15 minutes. Why? Because the first 15 minutes are just general FLUFF used to stretch this out to an HOUR!Second, the story. The scientists will make Mr. Duvall into an alien (EXACTLY like the ones that landed) and chase him into the alien ship in hopes the real aliens will embrace him? And Duvall is supposed to say to the aliens, I do not know my origin, but I've been on earth for a while? Plain ridiculous on every count. Even SCI-Fi needs boundaries and limits ... even in the Outer Limits.Thirdly, the masks used would have looked good in 1950 ... I don't care what kind of a budget they had ... the look of those creatures is too hammy."
4,"Dated, but helpful child development reference.","I have bought these books each year as my son grows up. The social context is fairly dated, but the behaviorial and abilities information is very helpful. It has been reassuring to find his behaviors are not totally out of sync with one interpretation of typical development. I usually read the next age shortly before his birthday and refer to it thoughout the year. It is definitely an inexpensive and fairly helpful reference."
4,"Helpful, but could have been better.","Having bought ""Your 6-Year-Old"" and found it terrific, we purchased this book when we were going through some problems with our then 8-year-old. ""Your 6-year-old"" was extremely helpful to us at the time, giving us lots of tools to deal with the changes our daughter was going through. However, ""Your 8-Year-Old"" didn't seem to go into as much depth as the 6-year-old one did. The descriptions of various personality traits and development phases seemed more general in this book than in the 6-year-old book. Although it was helpful, we felt that it could have gone into more detail."
1,Reader's Digest Niveau,"This book is not in the slighest bit scientific. So called facts are not referenced. The reader gets no idea where the author's ideas come from: for example, whether they are personal observations of children, whether they are from secondary sources. Very outdated ideas of sex and sexuality -- goes so far as to posit a century of ""feminist"" literature against ""common sense"".Reading level is about Grade 6."
1,Xerox 6400,"The Xerox 6400 scanner comes with lots of software, including PaperPort SE for managing documents and ArcSoft Scrapbook Suite for editing photos and creating collages for scrapbooks. Unfortunately, the package is undermined by relatively low scan quality for the claimed 3,200-ppi resolution and 48-bit color depth.Comes with PaperPort SE 9, which has built-in OCR for document management. Scans 35-mm slides and film. Software is easy to learn and use.Resolution doesn't live up to the 3,200 pixel-per-inch (ppi) claim."
3,Doesn't let much light in,I replaced two vent covers on my 2001 Forester and they were easy to install and fit well. The plastic covers have to be removed inside and mine were brittle so be careful when you remove and reinstall them. I would give these 5 stars except they let so little light in because they are so thick. I'd get clear ones next time.
2,Quality,"I was happy this item arrived on time for my trip. I was not happy that it wasn't checked for quality. Both ends of the hinge, pop rivets go thru the plastic vent lid, but not the hinge."
5,Good quality,Easy to install and much more robust than the original 'Ventline'. I expect this to hold up longer than the original.
4,ONLY one to buy!,"These unbreakable units are a perfect replacement to the stock cheapie ones that break with hail. They are only about $4 more, and you don't have to worry about water damage from a broken lid, and more importantly, you don't have to keep replacing them and waisting your time. REAL easy to replace. Only downside, they are not as translucent as stock, so they block a lot more light."
5,Camco vent,"This Camco Vent is a snap to install also unbreakable, for half the cost of a metal vent this is working out great highly recommendI changed out all three in my 5th wheel, factory one's lasted only 1 1/2 years these will last forever."
5,EXCELLENT REPLACEMENT VENT LID,SOLID AND REASONABLY PRICED VENT LID REPLACEMENT. EASY TO INSTALL.AS FOR UNBREAKABLE - ONLY TIME WILL TELL THAT.
4,not easy installation,"Camco 40168 Vent Lid Ventline and Elixir PolypropyleneThe packaging has changed, but the product is the same. We found this to be a really nice lid, but the installation was a bit of a challenge. The metal had to be cut to install the retaining clip. Still worth it, but buyers should be prepared to make modifications {we used them for Ventline vents on a 2003 trailer]. Would have been 5 stars, except for it not being a quick and easy installation (as listed on the box)."
4,poor quality control or wrong part #,"We have an 03 Forest River Wildcat. These covers fit perfectly EXCEPT my husband had to drill out the rivets and turn the lift track around 180 degrees, then they worked fine. He said the quality of these lids and lift track is FAR superior to the factory or standard lids and we expect them to last for years. Based on the description at Amazon and the reviews I ordered the correct lid, so were the lift tracks installed backwards or is this the wrong lid????? hmmmmm"
1,poor quality control,"Very poor quality control, after installing three new vent covers on the roof of my rv ,found two of the covers had the crank slide installed in reverse at the factory, really, thay dont have anybody inspecting this crap?, After drilling out the factory rivets and installing the crank slides in the correct fashion as the should have been installed from the factory , extra hour or so to complete the job, otherwise very strong durable material but would think again before buying camco products"
5,Excelent,"the hard disk is excelent, all new, and is workin like I spect in the computer. I only install the HD and carge the software."
5,"45,000 hours and 7 years of hard use","I just pulled one of these out of my dmc xcleft 500 mp3 player that went about 45,000 hours. 2004-2012. P.S. the original batt pack still last 8 hrs on this player - take that, ipod lovers."
5,"Toshiba MK 8025GAS - Hard drive - 80 GB - internal - 2.5"" - ATA-100 - 44 pin IDC - 4200 rpm - buffer: 8 MB","I ordered an 80GB HARD DRIVE and they upgraded to a 100GB no extra charge,...I replaced a drive that had worked GREAT for years, Love My HP laptop,..so wanted to keep it alive,..the CLONE went great, installed the HARD DRIVE and HAD MY hp UP & RUNNING in no time...I recommend this one or you could go for one with A higher rate spin (rpm) and A VERY GOOD THING WOULD BE A larger buffer...however I was very pleased with this one, easy install in case you worry about it, oh in the HP Laptop anyway,..they delivered on time and it Was PACKAGED VERY WELL and FOR that,...BELIEVE ME,...I DO,..thank them!"
2,Not what I expected from Nikon.,"I bought this particular window mount because it is made by Nikon. I thought that if it is a Nikon, then it will be a good one. I don't know if my window mount's performance is typical or not. But mine works well for horizontal positioning (side to side), but the vertical adjustment is very sloppy, and therefore proper vertical positioning (up & down) is usually achieved only after multiple tries. Once it is locked into position, it works very well, but it gets a bit frustrating at times to make the vertical adjustment. I'm beginnning to think I would have been just as well off buying the less expensive window mount."
5,Goin' Back To Texas,"I listen to his music everyday and watch his shows everyday. His voice is wonderful. I had rather listen to him than anyone I know. He was my hero as a little girl and still is that hero. If he were here today with the kindness and goodness he showed to others then, maybe our world would not be in the shape it is in today.I love the sound of his voice when he started out and now that the songs have been digitally redone, they don't sound like the old Gene Autry. Never the less, this is a great CD as usual."
4,Well pleased,My little dog had a severe itching problem. This product cleared it up very nicely.She no longer suffers from that endless biting and scratching. Thank You
1,Poor,"As a student, lessons are not explained. Having a poor teacher doesn't help, but every time I turn to the book an explanation is lacking. After reading the unit, the problems generally seem completely detached. I will work through the examples and come to an understanding of the material, and not be capable of completing a single exercise. Very difficult book to understand if you are not already fluent in mathematics. Coming from an otherwise A student."
1,Worst Lawnmower I ever used,"This mower is not worth the money. I have been mowing lawns for almost 40 years and I have never used a mower that is as bad as this one. I put it on the highest setting and tried to mow my lawn and it won't even cut the grass. If a came to an area where the grass was a little high it would jam up and stop dead in its tracks. I packed it up and sent it back the day after I got it. Stay away from this mower, it is a waste of money."
1,WORTHLESS!,"I recently bought this mower thinking it would be great for trimming the yard between regular mowings. IT IS WORTHLESS! From the first day the pins to adjust the blade height constantly came loose and had to be reinserted. Now, after less than a month, and barely any use, the wheel caps have popped off and one wheel is split. I have several types of grass in my yard and it does not cut the wide-bladed grass (St Augustine) at all, just tears at the tops some, and it only snips off very few of the thin-bladed grass (Bermuda) and that is only after making 5 or 6 passes. This so-called mower is now sitting out by my trash can. It is so bad that I would not even try to give it away, and I cannot think of any way to recycle any of it."
2,Had to return it,"I was sad to be disappointed by this product. The wheel wouldn't turn each time I pushed the mower, and it wasn't blocked, it just seems to be over-engineered, like there's a spring-tension deciding whether the wheel should turn or not. If weight needs to be applied down for it to turn it won't work right on the hills. I have a yard with some areas that are steep, so the design did not work.I returned it and spent the higher price on the Brill reel mower and love that tool. The Brill turns and cuts grass every time I push unless there's a stick caught in there, and those are easy to remove. The Brill seems just a better made machine, too. More sturdy."
2,Push Lawn Mower,Would not cut grass unless several passes were made. Item returned to Amazon for Credit.
2,"This product isn't the best, but it cuts the grass some!","Thankfully... we have a very small yard. If the grass gets more than about 3 to 5 inches tall... it will lock up and not cut it. If you are someone with a small yard and won't allow it to get more than 3 inches to 5 inches tall... you can use it. I go over my yard with it... having to use it some like a vaccuum... over and over each spot a few times, and then I finish up the blades that weren't cut with a weedeater. If you want a professional and easy cut... this is not the product to get, but if you are just wanting to save money and can deal with the advice given... this will be the product for you."
5,one of the best,"This is truly one of Susie's best CD's. I've been a Susie fan for about five years now and I wish she would of done a hymns album a long time ago. This CD is so fun to listen too and you can't help but to sing right along with her. If you like the old hymns, you won't go wrong buying this CD."
1,Wrong product delivered,"the item description is ""Cisco PAP2 Phone Adapter for Vonage Internet Phone Service"", while the item shipped is the ""unlocked PAP2 phone adapter"" which doesn't work with Vonage service, and useless in this case. The 2 adapters can be differentiated from the led colors. If the leds are blue, it's the vonage one, if they are green, it's the unlocked one. Unfortunately, the image on Amazon doesn't show led colors, in order to validate this is the correct item.The source of the problem came fromt the fact of choosing the product among the list not recommended by Amazon. The reason it was chosen from that list is the huge price difference: Around 80$ for one and around 40$ for the other."
1,"If I could rate this product NEGATIVE stars, I would.","Simply put, the item is fine. The product is stylish, functional when used with Vonage's service, etc..However, this is one of the worst cases of false advertising I have ever seen. This hardware is LOCKED to vonage's service!"
1,"Awful costumer service, cannot get to account dept even after 4 hour wait on phone","Believe me, you do not want Vonage service. You will curse your luck that you ever signed up for it. I bought this unit few months ago. The vonage service worked for few days and then unit started giving trouble. It would not work half the time. Then one fine day it stopped working. I still have my land line so I wanted to cancel the Vonage account. I called the account dept several times but nobody would pick up the phone. I waited a total of 7 hours trying to get hold of somebody who would take my call. The only live person I could get to were from technical support who were of no use. On top of all this I was told that there is cancellation fee of $40. I still cannot figure out how to cancel my account. Looks like I will have take the vonage account to my grave.SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT"
5,Vonage service,"Vonage has saved me a lot. The quality is better that the Verison and I don't have to deal with them. No more LD and inter lata charges. I used to pay 8 cents to my neighbors since we were in different zones. Internation quality, availability and price is the best. Search the web for vonage best deal and you can get it free for two months."
2,OK... but failed after only 6 months,"Maybe it's me.. but I have had lousy luck with Linksys and long term reliability. This unit worked well out of the box, but stopped working after only 6 months. I had a similar issue with a Linksys Wirelss Router.. and Linksys tech support was of little help. My recommendation, stay away from Linksys."
2,"Great service, nasty buzz and humm","I love the Vonage service compared with Verizon's old-world service, but my first PAP2 had a relatively loud background humm. I returned the unit to Amazon (VERY EASY!!), but the second unit had the same humming, so I am putting up with it now and will call Vonage sometime again. I've read about this problem from others, too.[EDIT 3/1/06] It's a little late now(!), but if you plug in a connector into Line 2 and short the wires together, the unit works great with no buzz!"
2,Did not pass the wife test,"I thought this would be a great additional phone line.For $15 a month we could get all of the features and 500 minutes of calling anywhere in the US and Canada.Too bad no body can really hear us. Everybody complains we are too quiet.I sat on hold with Vonage support for a half an hour until they hung up on me.I then e-mailed me and they sent me a few suggestions, which did nothing, and I let them know.I have Verizon DSL with a Linksys BEFW1S4 v4 router.I tried it with my in-laws cable access and my old WRT54G v2 router with QoS and still no louder.I left my number for Vonage support after they hunh up on me and they never called or sent me another message.I tried some suggestions from Broadband Reports, opened ports, checked for leaks and still nothing fixed it.Since we are going on vacation to the British Virgin Islands I will take the unit along for a local number, but once I return so is the unit!"
4,Good quality product,This is my second Cisco phone adapter. the other one died after 8 years of use. The unit is too pricey since I paid less for the other one and Vonage gave me a refund for the purchase. will test this new one to see how it goes. Sound quality is good.
1,Bad Customer service? So VERY bad......,"I purchased the PAP2 but could never get it to work, and customer service is the WORST I have ever encountered (and I used to have Warner Cable and have flown Northwest Airlines!)Only 1 in 10 calls gets through and then the tech knows less than I do. They were willing to swap out the PAP2 with a router (for additional cost!), I already have a router that works fine, thank you. After days of dealing with the mostly non-existant customer service I decided that even if I could get Vonage service to work I didn't want to deal with them any longer. The last rep I talked to said that they were sorry and had hired 500 new CS reps recently, maybe they should have done that before they started to advertise heavily.If you do decide to try them keep this number handy - 1-800-860-5491, it is the cancellation department and even though they are very busy (surprise) it's still a shorter wait than the regular ""Customer Service"" number."
1,The worst customer service on the planet,"Gee go figure, when you want to sign up, you can do it online. When you want to cancel, you have to call...and guess what? They either put you in a never ending phone trap, or they just pick up the phone and ignore you.My vonage did not work from day one!!! When I tried to call customer service, I always seemed to end up getting someone with a horrible accent (If you want to fix a problem, it helps if you both speak and understand the same language)on the other end who had absolutely NO idea how to fix the problem. Their only solutions involved asking me to reset the router. When I said I did, they would sound dumbfounded, and then say ""hmmm, try it again"", or put me on hold until I had no choice but to hang up.Please do yourself a favor. avoid using Vonage until that fateful day when competition forces them to improve their customer service."
2,Expect this to fail eventually,"And Vonage will not give you a new one, no matter how long you have been a customer. To make it worse, these VOIP routers are a ripoff compared to the price of a decent, unlocked router. I had one of these for a couple years and it drops packets constantly now. It can't even route."
2,Router didn't last a year,"I switched from landline to Vonage July 2005. The first modem they sent me didn't work straight from the box so I had to pay to send that back and they sent me this modem. This modem just died, not even a year later. I had trouble with not receiving calls too. Vonage customer support is horrible. They hardly speak English and they had me try a few options to get the router to work then said sorry it's dead, buy a new one. I like the cost and general vonage service, but I think this modem sucks and I think their tech support needs work."
1,Worst VoIP Solution,"I was very excited on switching to Vonage until I had to deal with the terrible VoIP quality that the phone provided and the awful Indian call support center.Vonage will tell you it is easy to switch your current phone number to their service. All it takes is a couple of clicks. In reality it takes 3 months of waiting, several cryptic emails (when you call Vonage inquiring about the email they have no idea that you were even sent an email), and the WORST customer support I have ever encountered.I believe that I could come up with a better solution by employing my dog to man customer support center and stretching a string with two tin cans for the service."
1,Great adapter but horrible customer service,"Don't waste your money on this adapter. Vonage customer service is horrible. I have spent a week now trying to cancel my service with them but they refuse to let me talk to their Account Management team because apparently they are too busy cancelling other accounts (seriously! this is the message I just received on the phone with their ""Customer Care"" department!!)."
1,Dont Buy!! Unless you can get a Local Number,I did my homework and when I got my Vonage number it turned out it was 200 miles from where I was---So it means when your next door neighbor calls you--Its a long distant call.
2,Vonage would be great - if it only worked!,"I have been using Vonage for my small business for the last year and unfortunately will be switching back to regular phone service soon. Vonage is certainly much cheaper than regular phone service. Unfortunately the service just is not there yet. We have had regular outages (read weekly) that are not related to our internet service provider. This afternoon, our customers simply could not reach us by phone. If you called our number it just rang and rang. The system has a failsafe designed to route calls to voicemail in the event of an outage. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. Calls to tech support are greeted by 5 minutes of holding followed by a recording that says no one is available and hangs up on you. This service may be fine for dorm rooms but it just doesn't cut it for business customers."
2,i tried vonage and switched to Packet8,i tried vonage for 5 months and than gave up. vonage dropped many calls suddenly and it was not easy to get a dial tone when i wanted to make a call. i switched to packet8 and recommend packet8.com
1,You need to buy a router to make it work,"When I ordered this product, I thought,I will be able to make it work with my Vonage broadband telephone. To my surprise, I discovered,that is not the case. You need to buy an additional router to make it work. On the other hand, if you order online thru Vonage, you get an instrument which acts as both router+adapter. So you avoid clutter and no need for any hassles of buying a router.Hope this helps."
1,Vonage does not work.,"I tired Vonage for my business phone system. I could not get calls or calls would drop. For 3 and a half weeks my business either did not have service or very limited service. I am a systems integrator. I work with phone, data, TV and security systems for a living and I could not get this to work correctly under any conditions. The tech support is in India and I was on hold forever. I spent 11 hours trying to get this to work correctly for my office and ended up canceling the service and going back to a land line. Vonage is a mess and difficult to deal with. Stay away from this service."
1,Fuzzy sound and WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!,"Stay away from vonage! I have had it for several months, and have been trying to cancel it. I have been put on hold a MINUMUM of 45 minutes to and HOUR each time, and then transferred to someone ELSE who then does the bait and switch AGAIN. When you go to their web site, the only thing you can get is their custumer service number, which takes you RIGHT BACK to the same old nonsense. I need to cancel because of a military deployment, and all I'm getting is a run around...the same thing happened with AOL, but this is EVEN WORSE. There are tons of blogs out now about how VONAGE SUCKS...check them out. It's no wonder this company is tanking, their customer service is the absolute WORST!!!!!!!! I hope they read this.... they really need to change!!!"
2,"Line noise, Vonage only","I purchased one of these when they first came out and returned in the next day. Here's why:Line noise. Plug in the unit straight into a phone with no Ethernet connection. Hear the scratchy line noise?It's Vonage only. Nowhere on the box or on the web does it say ""usage of this product requires activation with Vonage."" I thought I was buying a generic VOIP (DTA) adapter, not a piece of hardware that only works with one vendor.Very dissapointed."
4,This item is usable only on Vonage Service.,"This is a great product, I plugged it into my router and filed out the web page at www.vontage.com . Called the number issued from them and the attached phone rang. Very impressive for my girlfriend. She went and bought one as well.I didn't realize that this item is locked to Vonage. So if you want a differnet VOIP provider look for the PAP2-NA model. Currently Linksys has recalled all the -NA models from retail sales outlets."
1,Buyer bewaree,"If you're buying any used Vonage adapter, you need to know that Vonage will refuse to activate it if the previous owner has any balance due on their account. This has happened to me for both of two used adapters I've purchased on Amazon. Get the MAC address of the Vonage adapter, call Vonage, ask if they'll activate it. Odds are you're buying a useless piece of electronic junk."
1,BEWARE !! Dont't buy it !,"I bought 4 PAP2s to my company and after I received the 4 devices - Vonage told that they PAP2 are locked and I cannot use another provider.Don't buy, buy anotother one, the pap2-NA.I will try to return all to Amazon because I don't want to use Vonage.Vonage can give the password and unlock it but vonage doesn't want to give it, Linksys doesn't help me at all.DON'T BUY IT !!!"
1,Don't Do It,"Please, I beg of you, do not get involved with Vonage. I must have spent 4 hours waiting on hold to reach customer service, billing, and number transfer. The only person I was able to speak to after 2 months was someone in the cancelation department! Get this, there is a $40 chage for canceling the service hidden in the contract!! While the device itself works, everything about Vonage is underhanded. All I can say is don't do it...."
2,These do not hold up,I've owned 3 of these over a period of about 4-5 years from which you can deduce that the they last around 18 months to 2 years. That is pretty poor . . .Also - I've fought with these and with Vonage for years and never have been able to get faxes working well consistantly.
1,PAP2 is locked into Vonage,There are dozens of service providers out there with different options but the PAP2 is locked to Vonage. You can't use any other provider unless you can get the unlock password from Vonage (which they won't give you) and reprogram your PAP2. Buy the PAP2-NA instead which isn't locked.
2,Disapointed,The kahler tremolo that comes with this guitar is very cheap. After I restrung the guitar for the first time the piece that holds the ball end of the string in place snapped off when I was using the whammy bar to stretch the strings. The paint on the kahler scratches off very easily as well. If you purchase this guitar you will have to upgrade to a higher end kahler as this model is indeed very cheap and is not designed for a player who enjoys using the whammy bar.The pick up configuration of the EMG 81 and 85's is a fantastic combination in spite of this guitars other flaws. I caution whoever is looking to but this guitar as it is also made in Korea and not a US model.
2,MISSING FILLER?,"I purchased this bone based on the research and reviews on amazon.com. I was also attempting to buy a product that was USA made. I will say that the delivery was fast. I have a 38lb. Cocker Spaniel and Black Lab mix. She loves this bone and it definitely keeps her interest. I opened the package not realizing that it was not filled. Well there was maybe 1 tsp. of filler in the entire bone. Of course a product never looks exactly like the picture, but to not be filled hardly at all? I will be contacting the company directly and will repost or remove my rating if they honor their company. I will be asking for a new one! I should have taken video of what I received and checked it over more throughly. I'll let you know the outcome!"
5,brake tool,"looks to be decent quality; have not used it yet, but I do a lot of wrenching, but anticipate this to be very useful"
1,It does not work as intended,"When I ordered this product I paid extra for rush shipment but it turns that this ""tool"" is poorly designed and was a complete waste of my time. As you turn the spreading screw the tool starts to slip from between the brake pads. The handle attached to the spreading screw is just too short and you will never get enough leverage to spread your break pads apart. After fumbling with this ""tool"" and becoming thoroughly frustrated, I threw it aside, grabbed a large screwdriver and was able to compress my break pistons with relative ease.I had actually considered purchasing other OTC products, but after dealing with this tool its doubtful. Hey if your selling a tool as a break pad spreader why not test it make sure it can actually do the job. This is a simple tool and it should have worked as intended."
5,Best. Tool. Ever.,Can't express how much easier a pad change is for Ford/Toyota disc brakes with this tool. Works fine with absolutely zero issues. Should last a lifetime. High quality. Very pleased with this purchase - beats a C-clamp any day of the week!
1,Does not spread wide enough for all calipers,"Even with the screw threaded all the way in, this spreader did not spread wide enough for my calipers (2007 Nissan Quest). I ended up having to put the old brakes I just took off between the end of the screw and the handle it screws up against to get them to open wide enough (look at the picture and imagine putting something between the bottom of the black part and that flat part it is up against, so that the other side is open wider.They worked OK when I did that but it made it a bit more difficult than it needed to be and I imagine there could be some calipers where this issue might make it impossible to actually work at all. I would go with another type if I were purchasing again."
3,"So much, yet so lacking","For the Gamma World campaign our group start, I went out and bought the necessary books. As I work on the campaign, I try to think of interesting scenarios the players are to encounter. My intent was to use Gamma World only creatures found only in this book, but I quicklky find out that this will not be enough. For as many creatures found in this book, there seems to be a strong lack of proper variety for more-common-but-not-too-common encounter. In other words, many of the badies found in this book are just too powerful OR mundane to use against a group of new to slightly advanced players. For now, I'll have to either use other characters as enemies than the information offered here.I do, at least, recognize that in Gamma World, just the natural animals tend to be a scourge against the players -- and perhaps that is where this book is the most powerful."
5,Excellent Product,This is excellent product all my tv and surround sound sytem are connected in this product. clear bright and nice sound its amazing!!...
5,Monster Mash Up,Worked good right out of the box! Plugged everything into it and it was good to go. It is one of those products that doesn't do much unless something goes wrong. So hopefully no issues in the future
5,More than just Surge Protection,For about 25% more cost than just a really good surge protector you can also include a power conditioner. The Monster HTS 1600 is a great value. It is not the latest model but it gets the job done. It has a red display instead of the latest blue display. I really thought all the statements about a power conditioner was just hype to get me to spend more money on a fancy surge protector but the Monster HTS 1600 is the real deal. After I purchased a unit and saw the difference a ordered a second. You can buy more expensive models but as I already said this unit gets the job done.
2,It works despite the packaging looks like used one,"When I open this package, I was surprised that the packaing looks like this is a used item even though it was suppose to be new. Once I plugged it in and start using it, it works up until now. Didn't bother to file a complain."
5,good product looks cool,"i was very hesitant about ordering this product not a big believer in how well it would work, but for a hundred bucks i thought it was worth it just for the power surge protection. to my suprise this is a heavy well made product, and i did notice my sound being slightly better. i have a pioner elite sc35 amp 2 3d dvd blue ray player and a 60 inch plasma flat screen, poered sub woofer ect ect, i have alot of money tied up in high end equipment and for the 100 bucks this product exceeded my expextations and is a small price to pay to protect all my toys"
3,for the gadget geek freak and professional,"Here's who needs this overpriced item:You are planning to use this in a professional studio to record and play.You are a gadget freak.You have too much money.You really live in a crappy or old house or neighborhood with poor electrical wiring and alot of interference.otherwise, for the other 98% of you, you don't need this."
1,Another Monster Gimmick,"Don't waste your money or your equipments life on this so called ""clean power"". This company spends all their money on cosmetics and advertisements and not performance. Look for yourself... go to their website and look at the specifications, or lack of, for this product. No where does it mention specs for AC Noise Attenuation etc. I have worked in the sound and vibration industry for 10 years. Trust me... those who are into high-end audio equipment don't even look at this Monster crap. Check out reputable companies like Furman or PS Audio. Research your audio/video equipment through stores like Audio Advisor or HIDEF Lifestyle. Its a shame that companies like Monster fool people into their products with fancy adds and kickbacks to stores like BestBuy etc."
2,Monster MP HTS 1600 Power Center,"I purchased the Monster MP HTS 1600 Power Center on Decmeber 05, 2012. I connected it to my equipment on January 13, 2013, and on January 29, 2013, I realized that the ""Clean Power On' Indicator (blue light) is no longer burning.The ""Abnormal Voltage"" Indicator (red light) is not burning and that indicates to me, that my voltage is normal. I beleive that the blue light has failed. I am very unhappy since I have just purchased this unit. I agree that safe protection is paramount but at the same time, it is still good to know that systems to verify that all circuits are working properly are indeed functioning correctly. As this point, I am unsure; therefore, for that anomaly, I am only giving it 2.5 stars.I am hoping that someone from Monster Power sees this review and offer an explanation or how to have the unit repaired."
5,Good quality,Good quality. You may need a port extender if you have several digital equipment pieces. The LCD shows Voltage and is rather bright. I just put a piece of duck tape over it and keep the unit under the entertainment center.
3,"I dig ""Now Dig This""","I've been a fan of The Elvis Brothers since I saw them open for Billy Idol in Chicago. I saw them in concert during the 1980s whenever they came to play within a reasonable driving distance. ""Now Dig This"" is their album. Their first was ""Movin' Up"" and the second was ""Adventure Time"" (the two of which were subsequently released in 1995 by Recession Records/Sony. ""Movin' Up"" is still number one with me, but I do enjoy ""Now Dig This"" and recommend it."
1,"Not for me, but maybe for you.","I found this one in a Newbury Comics bargin bin for $1.99 and I know why it was there now. I tried to be fair. I even listened to the record a total of four times and it never grew on me. His flow is generic and bland. The beats are luke warm or room temperature at best. I've heard better rap artists that make only one album and then go under, so why does this guy have three CDs altogether? He's never even gone gold. The problem here is that his style seems out-of-date. I mean the guy is in his late 30's. I don't think he can ever appeal to kids and young teens who are the main buyers of rap music. You might want to try this album on for size if you're in your mid to late 20's. And he does have a good voice, so females, listen to clips of his music first before you buy it to see if hes for you. I think hes still around for the love of the game and not for sales. Good for him."
1,"Is this one a ""rap"" cd????!!!perhaps a ""cat"" cd!!","Oh My God!! Benzino is the most creative Hip-Hop artist ever! All other artists can't even dare of thinkin of competing with him!!! This album is a masterpiece, a classic, lyrics which make me faint with their deepness! He doesn't discriminate anyone, he is peace loving! Even doesn't diss any other rappers, especially Eminem! Since he is half white and half black he doesn't say anything against the white race especially and thinks that hip-hop is open to everyone even to white people!! BULLSH**!!!!!!!! Benzino go ---- yourself!!! and ur mag too!! u're makin hip-hop look stupid! if hip-hop was u....man this ain't music! this is a bunch of cliche lyrics put together to get some quick bucks by dissin someone who's talented not like u!! By the way i didn't buy the album i just borrowed it so i'm not dissappointed that i gave you some of my cash!!"
3,Just to let you know....,"I can't review this album seriously because I haven't listened to it, but I have to say:If anyone wants to rep Boston, go and buy a Gangstarr album, or a Jazzmatazz album, 'cause the legendary Guru is from Boston and I can't believe that anyone would be able to touch him lyrically ( plus DJ Premier's production is dope too)"
1,come on yo,"man i would never buy this album, i listened to a friends copy, more or less all the way through and i have to say (and this isnt just hating) this album is horrible yo. if you think that this is what hip hop should be...then you obviously watched too much mtv yo. its nasty and cheap and realistically hasbenzino should go back to co-owning that wack, over-commercial excuse for a hip hop magazine."
4,A Complete Listen.,"Before all these Em fans start writin me death threats please try and understand my review. I agree with all of you, when they were beefin back in forth with the diss records I was on Em's side 100%. Slim smashed him for real. Much Respect. The reason that I'm givin this 4 stars is that this IS a complete gangsta rap record. There are a wide variety of beats and topics with amazing guest artists. I do understand that a weaker rapper will surround himself by greater wordsmiths, I'm still not going to take him down for that. He is a fan first and it shows. If you are a fan of rap or can look past the beefin you might enjoy this as much as I did."
1,The Benzino Project,ALL I CAN SAY IS BENZINO IS NOTHING BUT COMMERCIAL SH**..... HE IS GARBAGE.... I JUST HOPE HE HAS NOT LEFT IS OFFICE JOB AT THE SOURCE.... HE HAS NOTHING ON EMINEM... SUXS DONKEY AS*
1,Benzino keep it up,"This album is complete [junk] ...The only reason i would even give this ... albumeven 1 star is because it has decent beats but even then it can't save this album from the intense stink of pop rap,...All in all this album only has one good song..."
1,Wack!,This CD is just play boring...old recycled beats. I'm from Boston and there are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many better rappers in Boston....arg.
5,Very festive!,"Basically, if you like what you see in the picture, you like this item. Its 2 inches wide and about 2 3/4 inches tall -- the perfect size picture frame magnet for a dorm fridge!"
3,The scenery is the best part,"I was sucked into this game by the gorgeous setting; it takes place inside a small, posh art museum where you spend most of your time wandering around and looking at the sumptuous objets d'art collected there. You're looking for clues to a mystery involving relics of Genghis Khan and a modern cult wishing to use those relics for a sinister purpose. Sounds good, but it lost something in the actual execution. First of all, the puzzles are exceedingly contrived. At one point, to progress in the game, you have to brew a cup of tea. Do you do this the normal way? Oh no. You have to rig up this complicated device involving a toilet paper roll, toothpicks, and I can't even remember what else. Why??? I also hated the ending. The ""winning"" ending is only slightly less depressing than the ""losing"" ending. I finished the game only to wonder why I'd spent so much time on it."
5,For the price it's the most satisfying portable player ever.,Great design-has desk stand built in. Screen quality very good for the size. Built in speakers are above average. For better sound use headphones or get a small FM transmitter and send the audio to your table radio/stereo system. Battery life could be better at only 2.5 hours. DC/AC adapter included. All in all it's the most versatile design I've seen in a portable player. Makes a fantastic gift or buy it for yourself. You probably deserve it.
1,Mine wouldn't charge either,"I also had trouble with the first one charging so I sent it back and now the second one won't charge either. What a pain! The product is great but if it won't charge, I cant use it on airplanes. Will try to find another brand without this problem."
1,Battery Won't Charge,My husband loves this DVD player but the battery won't charge. It's frustrating. I would not recommend this item.
3,hand held dvd product,"Cumbersome to use, but good quility picture and fair sound. Can attach it to a TV for a larger picture. I however use it rarely because I now use my vedio IPOD which can do more with much better quality for home, and offsite program displays for differant organization.Rick"
2,"Audiovox D1420 4.2"" Portable DVD Player.","Not as good as I expected The latch broke, it only lasted one Monthe by openig and closing the cover, it didn't last to long."
2,"I Ordered one, but first two were broken!","I would love to try this. First one was shipped broken (make a clanking noise and woulnd't work). Sent it back and got a new one that didn't read a DVD. I may try one more time.Its pretty heavy, but I am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i-pod type machines."
1,DEAD IN LESS THAN 3 WEEKS !!!,"Bought as a replacement for an earlier model that functioned for nearly three years. This one quit working well under one month. Seller was of no help with refund, repair, or replacement."
2,Battery Dead After Four Months,"I did what the others said to do when I first got this for my son. After watching a full length feature dvd with it plugged in, I shut it off and unplugged it. At first the battery lasted 5 hours. It was great! But it started to hold less and less of a charge. Now it won't hold a charge at all no matter what we do. It will still work on dc but I needed this for my son's 1 1/2 hour bus ride to school, and he cannot plug into any outlet on the bus, so we're back to square one in finding him a durable dvd player for that long ride."
4,Battery Wouldn't Charge,"The battery wouldn't charge at first and we sent the intial one back for replacement. The new one wouldn't charge either. This seems to be a common problem for this item, but we tried watching a movie with the player plugged in and it worked fine. We then discovered that the player would then charge. We haven't had any problem getting it to charge since. With this problem resolved the player has been great! Very light weight and easy to use. My son loves it...makes car trips much less boring."
3,Battery,Tried to watch a DVD with the battery fully charged and found that there is no way to watch a complete movie without recharging the battery. Battery life should be longer.
4,Cute Little Portable DVD Player,I bought this to use on our trip since we have a 4 hour plane ride. The screen size is smaller but I love the compact size ... almost like a portable cd player. The resolution is excellent and the sound quality is better than most. I wish the battery wasn't built in so I could use a second battery but it is rechargeable. It comes with the car adapter and plugs to use on a regular tv so all around I think its sweet for the $119.00 cost. Most players you can't touch for under $200.
2,I've had multiple battery problems,"I received this for Christmas 2005 as a gift. The new player out of the box wouldn't hold a charge for longer than 2 minutes no matter how many different ways I tried to play and charge it. In February 2006 I had to pay Audiovox $60 for a new battery (item was a gift so I did not have original receipt for the warranty). Now it is October 2006 and the new battery has stopped taking a charge again. Audiovox informes me that I must pay another $35 to have it fixed again (since I am past the 90 day warranty). I'm very angry that in order to make it run for more than 10 months, I'm supposed to pay $95, the cost of a new machine. My husband has a Panasonic portable DVD player that has been running great for 10 years with one battery change so I'm going to look into that brand."
2,Looks great...but,"I purchased two of these - one for each child. We charged them the recommended time before use. Neither of them worked, so we charged them again, this time overnight. They still did not work. I have to say, though, that they did work when plugged in. My kids really liked them - they come with the cool carrying bag and they are easily handheld. But if they only work while plugged in, they were not very portable and did not fit our needs. I ended up purchasing some Axion units, which are not handheld and actually more like little laptops, but they work well enough."
3,Sony LCMDVDB Semi Soft Carrying Case for DCR-DVD403 Camcorder,"Case appears to be well made. The case is a little small. Camera with battery fits; however, it leaves no room for anything else. Camera with wide angle lens will not fit in bag. Great for a quick outing, but not what you want to take on vacation for all your filming needs (extra battery, lenses, dvds, etc."
4,Sony LCMDVDB Semi Soft Carrying Case for DCR-DVD403 Camcorder,"This is a handsome looking case. It is easy to get the camera in and out. If you are like me who doesn't want (and need) to carry a big bag, you will like this. The case also has an clip on battery storage case for your extra battery."
4,"aw, have some fun...","I've been to several of MOS's lives shows (including the one to sponsor this album) and though they seem at their best in person, this EP is better than passing fare. They've recently had a child and this album is a great little reminder that they're still out there. Lyrical and affectionate these songs are a great hors d'oeuvre before another full-length album.And for gods sake, go see them live if you can! Any qualms you may have about their covers will be put to rest."
3,HELP LOVE THIS SONG CANT FIND IT,"hey i really loved the movie and the music. Does anyone know who sings the one song when they are dancing in the half built house it has something like ""i dont really know life at all"" in it either the artist or song name would be so helpfulThanks"
1,:o/,"I fell in love with gusters ""What you wish for"" when i watched ""life as a house"" (i fell in love w/ hayden too, but thats another story). Since then I didn't know what it was called, I bought this CD and realized it was all instrumental! I was mad, and i really think that the actual rock songs, etc. made the movie even better and they should've put those on the soundtrack too. Unless you are big on instrumental peices, I don't really recomend this CD to you. Just go out and buy Gusters CD ""Lost and Gone Forever"" which has ""what you wish for"" on it."
1,Very Disappointed!,When one seeks a soundtrack for a movie one really WANTS to hear the songs featured in the movie. I followed advice of other reviewers and bought the GUSTER CD...a great CD...but all in all only 2 songs were on it from the movie. I wish I could find somewhere on the net that indicates the ACTUAL score from the movie so I could find the Radiohead song etc. The music was awesome in the movie...wish it was on this soundtrack CD...but no.
4,*****Different Version of Joni Mitchell's Song******,"OKay...so yes the credits say that its Joni Mitchell's song and performed by her, but off her album its different...In the movie when they dance, it is slow and deep and on the album the song sounds completely different...WHY?!"
3,Not the complete soundtrack.,"I bought this CD thinking that it would include ALL of the music in the movie--not just the the original tracks composed by Mark Isham. While the Isham music is good, the variety of artists used in the movie is not represented here.(Joni Mitchell is just one example, among many.) So, while I would recommend this CD, I am disappointed that it is not truly a complete soundtrack."
5,love the music to this movie,"absolutely loved the score of the movie and so had to get the soundtrack. everytime I listen to it, I remember exactly which scene it was played in. the score also has a nice calming effect whenever I'm stressed which is great."
4,Two Versions of Both Sides Now,"This song was recorded twice by Joni Mitchell.If you want the version of 'Both Sides Now' that was in the film 'Life as a House' you will need to get Joni Mitchell's lushly-orchestrated album 'Both Sides Now' released in 2000, not 'Clouds' released in 1969, where she accompanies herself on acoustic guitar. Or, you could get both, and hear the difference 30 years makes in the voice and style of arguably the best female singer/songwriter ever."
4,A Masterpiece,"First of all, the film was wonderful. It has been quite sometime since a movie of that caliber has been turned out. The score is just as good. Isham does a wonderful job with this score, it plays with every human emotion possible as does the movie. The only thing i'm really wondering is as to whether or not they are going to turn out a soundtrack for the film. I really want to know who is singing the song as sam, played by hayden christensen, tells alyssa that his father is dying. The lyrics are something to the effect of.....there there, that's not me, i'm not here, this isn't happening, i'm not here, i'm not here....and that is all that they play in the movie. (...) But overall it was a spectacular film and the score suits it."
3,Where's Guster?,"The film was quite good, actually! I was pleasantly surprised. I went just for Hayden Christenson and Kevin Kline, but the music and story were good too. How dare they not put the Guster songs on the album! I know ""What You Wish For"" opens the movie, but isn't ""Rainy Day"" also used or am I just nuts? If it wasn't, it should have been...just go buy Lost and Gone Forever. It's a fantastic Guster album. I'm just getting into them...What little I remember about the film score was good, though. If I see it again, I'll pay more attention and revise my rating accordingly.Just because I don't remember the film score doesn't mean it wasn't effective. I was practically crying at the ending. I don't do that unless the music works well. Film music that is subtle and adds dimensions is great stuff. So if you like the movie, this could be a nice, calm album."
3,song,"the song near the beginning where sam, the son, is listening to his music and alyssa is sitting at the picnic table is called 'soluble words' and it is by 'on'."
2,Great Score...now where are the songs?,"Can anyone tell me who did the Joni Mitchell song ""Both Sides Now"" that is NOT on this CD?"
3,Joni Mitchell song,"Dave Van Ronk redid the Joni Mitchell song 'Both Sides Now' in response to a previous review...his is a good version, as well."
3,end credit piece not included,"The brilliant piece featured in the end credits (the very last piece of music played) is not included on this CD. This final piece has the emotional depth and aesthetic beauty to truly summarize this film, but it has been left out for some inexplicable reason. The track titled ""Leap of Faith"" includes the basic piano melody, but it is slower, has less orchestral involvement, and covers less emotional ground. The same melody reappears in the second half of the track ""I Built Myself A Life,"" but again, there is no development. It was hugely disappointing to not find this piece on this CD; none of the actually included pieces have the same brilliance, although two or three are lyrical and good in their own ways."
4,I need help finding a song,"I just saw the movie tonight and I loved the songs, but have one question. You know the Judy Collins rendition of ""Both Sides Now"" that was in the film. Who sings that and is it on the sountrack? I thought it was beautiful. Please, I want to find this.Sincerely,Ian"
4,Rock song titles?,"Much like the other comments, I was really hoping to find all of the amazing music from the movie on this soundtrack. So I have a question to those who took note of the song titles of the rock songs--can someone email me the song titles you caught in the credits? I know the ones from Guster and Marilyn Manson, but not the others and would love to buy the music. Thanks!"
2,Where are the real songs?,"as great as the music for the movie is, the stuff on this CD just isn't it. The music that captures the emotion ofthis movie is the pop/rock. i think they need to release another soundtarack with the real songs of the movie."
3,HELP,"I LOVED the movie and the music- saw it 3 times. Does anyone know who sings the song when they are dancing in the half built house it has something like ""i dont really know life at all"" I AM GOING CRAZY TRYING TO fIND THE SONG OR THE ARTIST!!!? Was it Nina Simone??"
3,Life As A House,"hi! can someone tell me what song is played after Sam runs from the cops in the middle of the night, and lays his head against a post, and starts crying? it's one of the scenes in the beginning, after he prositutes himself, but gets caught by the police car. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT SONG IS PLAYED!"
3,Real Soundtrack,I agree that the soundtrack is more like a score. The music on the film was awesome and I think you should take the previously given advice and create your own soundtrack. I have the DVD and I wrote down all the songs from the credits. Here they are:Guster - What You Wish ForGuster - Rainy DayLimp Bizkit - Re-arrangedRadiohead - How to Disappear CompletelyJoni Mitchell - Both Sides NowMarilyn Manson - Sweet Dreams [Are Made of This]Supertones - Who Can Be Against MeViolent Femmes - Children of the RevolutionGob - That's the WayOn - Soluble WordsDefault - Live a LieDefault - SomewhereOhgr - WaterDeadsy - Gramercy Park
1,Songs from Movie,"Hi all, I've searched high and low and found these songs are on the movie. Since I can't get my hands on the movie to watch and sit through the credits I did it by ear and searching everywhere. Anyway there are still 3 songs I haven't figured out. But these are the 8 songs that are in movie. My suggestion, there won't be a soundtrack so just make your own.Guster - What you WantGuster - Rainy DayLimp Bizkit - RearrangedRadiohead - How to DisappearJoni Mitchell - Both sides NowMarilyn Manson - Sweet DreamsSupertones - Who Can Be Against MeViolent Femmes - Children of the Revolution"
2,Please release a Soundtrack in addition to this Score.,"I agree with all the comments. I saw the movie on a preview night. I went immediately to my computer to put myself on a waiting list for the release of the soundtrack, however, though I was happy to see something was available, I know only too well that the word ""Score"" is a clear indication you are not going to be getting any commercially released music that you heard during the movie. Though I will not buy the score, I would absolutely buy a Soundtrack of this movie. To those in the high castle, please consider releasing this as a soundtrack, but do it soon before the movie fades from our memories."
4,"movie version of ""both sides now""","first off, this movie is a definite tear jerker! and i made the mistake of watching it when it was my time of the month! lol anyway, i spent hours and hours trying to find that version of ""both sides now"" on the internet and i FINALLY found it. just look for the 2000 version of it. hope this helps!"
4,The song when they dance,"The song when they dance (I agree, the best part of the movie) is Joni Mitchell, Both Sides Now. I suggest that you purchase her 2000 CD release, ""Both Sides Now"". All of the songs are very mellow.I love Hayden!"
5,It was 2 a.m. in the morning and nothing was on except this,"The emotions running through me right now are taking over my body. This movie. This picture of this family is so real. I loved Kline in this movie, he made this character come alive and you wanted more, you wanted him to live. This is up there with my all-time favorites. I'll never forget this film. It made me cry. It made me laugh and see the goodness of what people can be, what people are. And I loved the music, the bands. But most of all, I loved the score. It made me cry with every scene. There are just no words strong enough to say how much I loved this movie...."
3,It's crap compared to Davison (which is out of print),"Okay so Davisons out of print but it's so much better (and called Group Theory For Chemists)! This book is a bit badly laid out, doesn't explain things very well and is pretty much useless unless you already have at least a simple grasp of Group Theory. I don't know what awful libraries you lot in Cleveland have but this is certainly not a particularly good book."
1,Total Garbage,"This is the perfect CD for the pre-teen with very low self-esteem and little or no sense of identity. This collection of hollow pop songs is sure to please anyone who doesn't actually like any music, but instead allows others to tell them what's good. Now that's what I call unoriginal and uninspired!"
3,Not as strong as some of the others,Highlights:1. Survivor Destiny's Child16. Hanging by a Moment Lifehouse19. Flavor of the Weak American Hi-Fi
3,Pretty good cd,"This is a pretty good cd. I bought it for ""Fiesta"" & ""Flavor of the Week"". I must say I was REALLY disappointed with the version of ""Fiesta"". I hate it when you buy a cd for a song you really like and when you receive it it is a totally different version of the song. Otherwise, the rest of the songs were good."
4,great except for three,"I recently bought NOW-7 and listened to it and concluded it was great. My favorite tracks are ""In My Pocket,""""Play,"" and ""Flavor of the Weak."" The latter sounds different than the radio version; sounds longer. The first two songs are played out by now and the next three are great. ""Playas Gon' Play"" is cool and ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind"" is hot. The ballads are all right, except for ""This I Promise You""; it's incredibly old and should have been on NOW-6. The rock songs give a great ending to this fine cd, but i hate rap and hip-hop(besides Eve) so i didn't like tracks 8, 9, and 10. This is the best NOW to me, and came out very quickly after NOW-6. Anyway, if you like pop this cd is worth your money."
2,A Template of Our Pop Music Malaise,"Ever curious why radio listenership is down 14% across the US (other than because radio hegemons like Clear Channel glut the commercial band with an average of 18 minutes worth of ads an hour that is)? Well, the vapidity of most of the music compiled in this series might offer a glimpse into the sentiments of educated adults and precocious teenagers Pining to hear something new and fresh ascending from the pop music culture. Though pop culture can forge a common thread of conversation among the disparate strands of interests pursued by the populace at large, the most oft-heard complaint of people about the state of popular music is how generic and insipid it's become. Those two adjectives describe well Most of the music compiled on installment number 7 of this series, with maybe two exceptions redeeming it somewhat for some buyers, but not, in my opinion, for those aforementioned adults and youth."
4,Pretty cool,"This cd Has really good songs, so i would give it a 5. But then there is the small problem w/the lyrics. If a radio station can play a song thats edited and it can still have the word as* in it then why does now have to edit it more. That was the only problem with this cd was the editing, there was TOO much! They need to put the radio songs on the cds, it would make them a lot better."
4,Great Music on one CD,"I love this Cd. It not only has great songs, but good artists too. I love buying the Now Cd collection. They always put the best chart topping songs on their cd's. I would defintely go buy this cd asap!"
1,It's beyond me why anyone would buy this...,"Ok, yeah, they're all hit songs, but there isn't a single one that doesn't make me change the station everytime it comes on the radio. They're over-played, and most weren't great to begin with. I bought one Now cd (the second one) listened to it twice, and left it in my mom's car 2 years ago. I just think the whole idea is a waste of money."
1,Oh puh-leez,"After having spent nearly two years in the U.K. it's shocking how far behind we are in putting together a decent compilation cd. I'm anxiously awaiting Now 50 to hit the stores over there so I can have friends send it to me. As for the songs included on this single disc, as opposed to the TWO you get over there, they are for the most part overplayed and under diversified, but I guess you can't cover many areas when you only have one disc to work with. I wish the States would catch up, or at least offer the U.K. Nows alongside our little efforts."
1,Dissapointing.,"The 6th edition of this series was far more worthy of the series title than the seventh. This CD has completely foregone the previously successful formula of having the best hits from many genres put into one compilation. Where have bands like Coldplay, Fuel, Incubus, U2, and Everclear gone? Most have released newer songs equally popular to those featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 6, and yet they have been ignored. Lifehouse, Aerosmith, and American Hi-Fi are the closest this album has, which pales in comparison to the fact that the last third of the 6th CD was filled with good music of this genre. These changes from the previous CDs clearly show that the source of money in music today is shifting from actual talent (and instruments) to talentless vocal acts that are indistinguishable from each other."
4,A must buy!!,"This is a great CD! But of course, there are a few flaws: 1. BAD EDITING!! The editing is horrible! The songs are much better without it. Also, they edit in th wrong spots half the time. I picked up a swear or two in Nelly's ""Ride Wit Me"". 2. ""This I Promise You"" is SO old!! The song's been out for a year. In the meantime, *NSYNC came out with a whole new album! 3. Some of the songs are a little played-out. But none-the-less, but still good. A few of my favs: ""Survivor"", ""Playas Gon' Play"", ""Ride Wit Me"" (despite editing), ""What Would You Do"", ""Never Had A Dream Come True"", and ""Hanging By A Moment"". 4. What's up with track six? First of all, The Backstreet Boys are hardly talented and definitely NOT rap people (they're hardly pop people!). The CD could have definitely gone without ""The Call"". Anyway, do give this CD a try. It's not that bad!!"
2,Cruddy cuts!,This cd has some good songs on it but they edit way to much out and it makes it very choppy... not pleased at all!
5,Buy it NOW,"This latest compilation has got to be the best of all the Now's. Every song on it except two are great songs according to me, you may love them all. This CD is a great example of a personal mixed CD, because it has so many great songs. If you buy this CD you will not be disapointed."
1,CENSORED,"When I first listened to this C.D. I thought my CD player was broken. Many of the songs sound like an old vinyl record ""skipping"" because of the extensive censoring of the songs. Words which apparantly someone found offensive are literally cut out of the song. Nellie's ""Ride Wit Me"" is especially annoying to listen to since it contains numerous ""skips"". Most of these songs are played on the radio uncut so I see no reason for the extensive censoring that took place. If you like any of the songs on this CD and are used to hearing them on the radio you are going to be very disappointed."
3,Better Than Average NOW,"Volume 7 of the NOW! series contains the familiar representation of bonafied hits(Janet's 'All for You', Eve's 'Let Me Blow Ya Mind'),moderate hits(Aerosmith's 'Jaded','NSync's 'This I Promise You'), shoulda been hits(Mandy Moore's 'In My Pocket', Samantha Mumba's 'Baby Come On Over'), and hits that should have been tossed in the garbage after their initial recording(Lifehouse's 'Hanging By A Moment',Nelly's 'Ride Wit Me'). The rest of the cd is filled out by average to subpar radio fodder, much of which didn't even make it on the radio. Still, this remains one of the better volumes in the series."
4,the best of the now series,This CD is the best out of the Now series because it does not have many ballads. It is a CD full of rock and pop music except for the occasional R&B. This is a great cd to spend your money on
3,Ummm...its ok i guess,"On the now thats what i call music volume 7 the songs are pretty good. i think they should of put some more recent songs on it. such as J.Lo and Ja Rule's ""I'm Real"" or *Nsync ""Pop"" The songs they put were kinda old. i also think that the editing on the c.d is horrible. if they have the urge to edit it the least they could do is do it right. personally i think they should of put a c.d out with the ""parental advisory"" sticker. it is much better than having to cut off a word every sentence!! i probably won't purchase any more ""now thats what i call music"" c.d.'s unless they put out one with the swares. if you don't like to listen to the swares and don't mind some old songs this c.d. is for you. this review should help you!! j/k!"
1,now that's just what I call BAD music,"I don't see a SINGLE song or artist I like on this list...I thought they were trying to have variety?? Looks like they failed miserably. Don't waste a dime on this. If you want REAL variety, look in you own backyard (local bands, for instance) & not the radio or tv!!"
3,commercial melting pop,"If you r looking for value, here's a compilation that'll do the job, and very well indeed. that is, if you'r a top 40 music maniac. All the hits, the big names, on one CD.And of course, you win some you lose some. By squeezing a hefty 19 tracks on one CD means u will have some songs shortened inevitably. Plus the fact that the record companies would want to reach the masses, there will be no parental advisory sticker which translates to rampant censorship on objectionable words. Thus you'll get those irritating blockouts like mentioned before by some reviewers.There's no concept here, just a ... attempt at reaching sales. Nothing wrong cos it's the way biz is all about. You'll get JLo, Britney, Mystikal, Aerosmith just to name a few."
1,Could've been better,"I listen to the CD and I was surprized that they did not put out a unedited version of the CD because it would have been worth purchasing then the edited one. I purchased it for the fact of listening to Nelly - ""Ride with me"" and 3LW - Playa's, and City High - ""What would you do"" with out the edit. If it did not have the edit in it it would have been worth keeping."
1,Here Are Some Songs That Should Be On Now! 8,"Here are some real good songs that should be on Now! 8.1. Limp Bizkit ""Boiler""2. D-12 ""Purple Pills""3. P.O.D ""Alive""4. Alien Ant Farm ""Smooth Crinimal""5. Bubba Sparxxx ""Ugly""6. Blink 182 ""The Rock Show""7. Drowning Pool ""Bodies""8. Gorillaz ""Clint Eastwood""9. Afroman ""Because I Got High""10. Jay-Z ""Izzo(hova)""11. Ja-Rule ""liven it up""12. P Diddy ""Bad boy for Life""13. Sum 41 "" In To Deep""14. DMX 'We Right Here""15. Nickleback ""How You Remind Me""16. Staind ""Fade17. Linkin Park "" In The End""18. Limp Bizkit ""My Way Remix"""
4,An album for all,"This has to be my favorite CD . When I feel like listening to the radio and do not feel like hearing the DJ talk,this is the CD I turn on. I also like this CD because I can listen to a whole lot of artist and not just a group or a certin person. This CD is a perfect gift to give someone you know if you dont know what there favorite music is."
1,Worst NOW yet!,"Usually I am so pleased when a new Now That's What I Call Music CD comes out and I rush to the store to buy it. With Now 8, that is not the case. I think it is the worst now yet. The songs that it has are way too old and were way overplayed all summer long. I don't think I could sit and listen to N'Sync ""Pop"" or 3 Doors Down ""Be Like That"" one more time! Joe ""Stutter"" came out in January and was popular in Feburary. What's it doing on Now 8??? If you want a real hit compilation this Christmas, get Totally Hits 2001. Otherwise, wait for Now 9."
3,"OK, a few goodies from 2001",Highlights:1. Bootylicious Destiny's Child9. Rock the Boat Aaliyah12. Clint Eastwood Gorillaz15. I'm a Believer Smash Mouth19. Be Like That 3 Doors Down
2,so r&b it's really not that good,"wow! i am so dissapointed by this cd. The Now series are my favorite cd's but this one is really dissapointing. Now eight has too much R&b it needs more pop and rap. The Aaliyha song is really difficult to listen to;I usally want to listen to her but this song isn't her best. The Janet Jackson song is ok along with Nsync's ""pop"" and Jennifer Lopez's ""I""m real"".Joe's ""stutter"" is so plain it's disgusting. ""start the commotion"" and ""me myself and i""are also really cool. Over all this is an average album and but i'm very dissapointed with it. So unless u really like r&b don't buy it."
4,Alot of the songs I know but some songs are blah,"Am to Pm is a totally cool song to me and my buddys. There are more but Britney spears, nsync and the Bakestreet boys should really have their own little mix CD. They are getting soooo old and Britneys new songs just dont fit her. Backstreet boys? what happened to them!"
4,A cd thats Top Of The Pops,"Im from the UK and when i looked at this CD i was amazaed to see that its only the 8th in the seris as over here we are now on Thats what i call music 50! back to the point, this is a wicked CD and has all the best music on it, im really glad Blink 182 is on it as they are the best band to ever walk the planet!!!! stay wicked people:-)"
3,"GOOD,NOT THE BEST","I never really like some of the songs.I don't like all songs that much for me.I care understand for one week.My favorite songs are u2's walk on,usher's u got it bad,nsync's pop,wiseguy's start the commotion,and janet's someone to call my lover.buy this cd today!"
1,Now thats what I call ...,"All of these Now compilations are nothing but a bunch of commercial ... that goes out of fashion very quickly. Because of stuff like this is that music is going nowhere, with artists who have no talent and are only in the business because they are good looking. I'm sure that the people who bought Now 1-7 don't listen to it anymore.PS: U2 and Aerosmith should not be on the list, they are the only ones with talent."
4,An okay cd!,"This cd has a few awesome songs and a few that are overplayed, or not my favorites. Stutter(remix), Me, Myself, and I, and Fat Lip are all the really good songs!"
2,Same artists over and over,"This is what I could call the series of the same artists. From the beginning of the US series a few years ago, half of the CD is filled with the same names; those selecting the ""hits"" should know that there are much better artists other than backstreet boys, janet jackson, jennifer lopez, etc. If they keep this line they won't make it to That's what I call music 10."
1,(Stinks),This CD reallly (stinks). I mean why are all of these old songs on it.I mean out of the whole CD there is only 4 songs i like and to pay (...) to pay for the other (...) songs is stupid. If you really want a good CD get totally hits 2001.
4,great,"This CD has a good selection of songs. All though there are a coupple of songs that are not on here that should be. For example I think that ""You remind me of a girl"" by Unser should be on it."
3,Its OK,"I don't have much to say about this. It's ok. But I really just had to say something after reading everyone else's reviews: why in GOD'S name are you guys giving Aaliyah so much sympathy?? Yeah, it's too bad she died, but ""Rock The Boat"" is a terrible song!! I wonder if a singer who weren't as good-looking as her would be so fondly remembered and praised, even after death?? Geez, her music was terrible!! Too much sympathy and honor is given to famous people who die, as opposed to people who are likely far better people than them who die, who aren't remembered at all!! Give me a break!!"
2,Now thats what i call average,Hardly any good songs on here WHATSUP? well here r some wayz u can improve on tha next one1) DC Emotions2) Rkelly The worlds greatest3) Gorilaz Clint eastwood (remix)4) Fat Joe with R.Kelly We thuggin5) JLO and Ja rule Im real (mrder remix)6) Nsync GONE7)JayZ Izzo8) Nelly #19) Sum41 Handle this10) D M X I miss u11) Mary J. family affair12) Miss e Minute man13) Creed My sacrafice14) Pink Get tha party started15) Eve I got what chu need16) Linkin Park (In the end17) Afro man Because i got high18) Usher Twork it out19) Mariah Carey Loverboy20) Train Drops of Jupiter
3,It's alright...,"for that kind of music...pure pop. The good side: the album plays it a little safe, choosing only chart topping, bonafide hits. You know exactly what you're getting. The bad side: you kind of get a 'been there done that' feeling. There's no real sense of discovery or excitment you get from really hearing and discovering new music. I would suggest, should you want to venture out and maybe try to expand your musical horizons a bit, checking out the 'SPIN THIS' album compilation. It is a really good collection of songs from a wide variety of notable artists who better represent what is going on in today's broad musical landscape."
3,Half good,"I think there are a lot of songs that shouldn't have been included on here, they could be replaced with better songs to represent today's popular music. They did make a few good choices though, with Backstreet Boys and Usher..I say they needed to put Incubus' ""Wish You Were Here"", Shakira's ""Whenever, Wherever"" and No Doubt's ""Hey Baby"". Along with a few other songs that were mentioned on here. I also think that putting BSB's ""Drowning"" on here would have been better. But it's not a total waste of a CD."
2,Stupid bullcrap!,"This cd should be called ""Now That's What I Call Bullcrap"". I'm giving it 2 stars because U2 and Aerosmith are there, since they are the only 2 good bands there. So take out the Aerosmith and U2 songs and yu got a huge collection of crap! For good music stick with bands like Nothingface, Machine Head, Coal Chamber, DevilDriver, Metallica(hell, even the new stuff's better than this junk), Sevendust,etc.,etc.,etc.,etc.,etc.Peace out all!"
2,Music for the masses,"With the advent of [affordable] Cd burners and the birth of morphus (the napster replacement) I find it a surprise that people go out and buy mix cd's like TIWICM 8. Besides the mere fact I can, and have, made better cd's myself the songs on TIWICM 8 are nothing more than pop fluff. Not even half of the bands on this cd are real musicans but mere puppets of large companies who want to dip their hands in the pockets of teens who have too much money to throw around. Nothing here is expermental or trying to break new ground it is nothing but repetion of grooves that have worked for years. I'm not saying it has to be expermental or has to break new ground to be good. Just I would rather sit in silence in my car then listen to archtypical ""rock"" on the radio. Listen to music you never heard of that the radio never plays, save yourself! I'll show myself off the soapbox."
2,The Bad Now,"I have been buying Now Since I was 4! I have always loved them but this was the worst one ever...Now co. You should Shirkera,Whenever Whereever, Backstreet boys Drowning, Ja Jule Livin it up and so much more so kinda listen to the radio and here what songs teens and kids chose what they wanna hear!I hope my review was helpful to all!"
2,A Little Disappointing,"When I saw the names of the artists involved on this collection, I was prepared for a top-notch CD. However, I found the music to be a bit of a letdown, especially compared to some of the other great Christmas records out there this year(...). Overall not bad, but don't get your hopes up too high!"
1,"Worst ""Now!"" In Series!","Usually, I race out to the store to buy the newly released ""Now!"" albums, and I did the same when ""Now! 8"" was released in late November. This time, I made a mistake. All the songs on this volume are very old, and like I read in another review, were very 'overplayed' all summer long. Many of the songs on this album are seldom played on the radio anymore, and some songs were never played at all. Like another reviewer said, if you want a good compilation album for the holidays, get ""Totally Hits 2001"""
2,depends what u like,"Seriously, who am I to tell u what kind of music to listen to. There are however, way to many old songs like stutter. I do like u got it bad by usher because that song is relatively new, but most of the other songs are old already. Here's my perfect now 8:1. My sacrafice- creed2. In to deep- sum 413. nsync- gone4. destiny's child- emotions5. usher- u got it bad6. britney- slave 4 u7. incubus- wish u were here8. jagged edge- goodbye9. nelly- #110. linkin park- in the end11. craig david- seven days12. pink- get the party started13. toya- i do14. shakira- wherever, whenever15. bsb- drowning16. lenny kravitz- drowning17. jimmy eat world- the middle"
1,Not Happy,"I bought this CD as new. When I got it, there was a name printed across the front under th plastic. It had scratches and sticky stuff on the CD itself. THIS ONE IS GOING BACK!"
5,wow...,"Like other reviewers, I was blown away by this album. So worldly, and yet still listenable (unlike experimental world music crap by Sting or Paul Simon) Simply amazing. I won't waste any readers time by going on and on. Almost all the other reviewers already said it best. Great Album, Great Band. RIP, Joe. Watch out for the Gamma Ray!"
4,the voice of the clash with fresh music,"This cd sounds like the clash but with the musical styles that mick jones used with his band BAD. Which is a good thing. Although the clash made a great record with london calling, they were never able to pull it all together on a consistent track by track effort again, until now. Strummer as an elder statesman leading a band that plays all different genre's well has made for a nice sounding record. The anger is gone, or below the surface, and the artist comes out. Check it out."
5,Remarkable,"I have been a Strummer fan since I found the first Clash import singles in the East Village a long time ago. I will listen to anything he does--I even have his soundtrack albums--but nothing prepared me for this album. It's intense, textured, full of passion and wit--and anger--and blends musical styles together so well that it creates a new unique sound. In a sense, it is as breathtakingly unexpected as London's Calling was in it's time. (He's not kidding when he said ""Global"", by the way.) This is 'mature' in it's depth of feeling and it's sharp observation. Some of the best work he has ever done."
4,Johnny Appleseed was the hook,"It played over the opening credits of John From Cincinnati (the best part of that show, by the way), and I wanted more. This is one of the most interesting pieces of music I've heard in a while. I'd always liked The Clash, but somehow I'd missed Joe Strummer's subsequent (and sadly short-lived) career."
2,Non-plussed with Joe Strummer's Global A-Go-Go,"I recently drove with a younger friend (40's) on a short trip, and he played this disk along the way--it caught my ear, but we were talking much of the time. As I was intrigued, I asked him about it and ordered it through Amazon. Unfortunately it didn't live up to my first impression: although I still like a few of the cuts fairly well, I'd describe most of it as random cacophony, a senseless mixture of sounds, styles, instruments, and noise common in modern youth and adults who 'grew up' over the last 30 or 40 years, thinking that to be frenetic is to be cool. To me, it's simply annoying, but then, how cool am I?: Apparently Joe Strummer has been around for many years although I don't think I've ever heard of him until now."
1,Not what I expected,"Even though the music is good, I hate this album because it doesn't sound exactly like The Clash. I had very specific expectations for this album: I wanted it to sound exactly like the Clash - especially their first album - especially the UK Version. But the ""music"" on this album bears little to no resemblance to the way I expected it to sound in my head."
2,Everyone Digs Through Old Tapes For Brubeck.,"From the opening burble as the tape deck gets up to speed you know this CD is not for the audio purist. There are misspelled names, wrong names, cuts that fade out in the middle and most other recording sins. This CD is only for the person who must have anything recorded by Dave Brubeck."
5,Hip!,"Good CD with narration from an old radio show. Gives one the feeling of sitting in a smoky New York jazz club in the 1950's, wearing a skinny tie, and sipping a martini."
4,good watch,"It is a nice watch, I don't like it as much as my moderna I purchased but it is good for everyday wear with style."
5,Love this watch!,"LOVE this watch....very ""smart"" looking...understated style....I put it on when I received it....have worn it with everything....and have not had one problem with it! it does have a ""timeless"" look and therefore...goes with everything....and for a watch with this name and look...and ...for the incredible low price....you cannot go wrong...and should not be disappointed!!"
3,Kevlar clutch kit,"This item shipped fast and was delivered without any issues. The only thing I feel I should write in this review is that my mechanic said this kit only provides 2 out of 3 things you need to replace ur old clutch. However,he said this was minor and he could still put the new clutch plates in for me. Also the plates are made with kevlar. AWESOME for durability."
4,Awesome book,"This book was just what I needed. It showcases eleven of the architects residential houses/housing. Each project has a few pictures, floor plans, elevations, sketches, and a brief description. If you're looking for a short, simple book with a few good examples of the architects work, look no further. If you want a book that documents all of Steven Ehrlich's work in intricate detail, I suggest you keep looking.Since this is essentially a picture book, I would rate this book a five for what it is.I gave it four stars since it took over a week to deliver something I paid one day shipping for."
1,Poor Customer Service-Still Waiting for my Refund,"Bought this for my daughter's car as a Christmas present. What the description doesn't tell you is that the car has to have some sort of plug in the trunk for this to work. When I tried to call for technical assistance, I was sent an email that explained how to set it up, even after I informed the technician that I had already tried that (it came with those instructions already) and that I needed to know if there was another way to program, I got no response. When I tried calling, I got no response. So, I sent it back, demanding my money back. It's been over a month and I still have not received a refund. If I could give this company no stars, I would!"
2,It is not made clear that these will not fit factory rims,"If you have a Toyota RAV4, these will not fit. You can only buy the locks that fit from a Toyota dealer. The fit guides are very misleading."
1,Selecting the correct model,"Following the drop down menu's I selected the above noted wheel locks. They arrived in quick order and I installed them. During the installation, I was not comfortable with how the locks fit. They didn't have a pre installed washer as the other lug bolts had. Concerned, I called McGard and spoke to one of their technicians and got the correct model number. He told me to go to a Toyota dealer and purchase the locks. I did this and sure enough this locks had a pre installed washer.My suggestion BEFORE you buy these, call McGard and speak with one of their folks and get the correct model for your vehicle. Don't depend on Amazons drop down menu's."
2,Buyer beware,"So how does a trilogy of novels present in a three hour film? Not at all well would be my response. I am still confused by the film. I have read the novels several times, and in this context could follow the film. At so many points in the film I felt that someone who did not know the novels would have to be lost.On the positive side, the era did seem to be well represented, the acting seemed well done, but I cannot help but think the film would be hard to follow or understand without knowledge of the novels.It is not possible to compare this film to the novels it attempts to represent. If one were to outline the novels and then film the outline, this film would be the result. In fairness, it seems impossible that three thoughtful novels, filled with satire and dark comedy can be well represented in such a short running of film.To get anything at all from this film, I would recommend reading the novels first."
4,An excellent story !,"Probably the best part of this movie was watching Virginia. It was a good story, well acted, had a nice mix of comedy (The Brigadier !), romance and sex (Virginia, again), and a cast of interesting characters who all could have had their own series and were stories within stories. It was entertaining and worthy of watching. I was glad that I had an opportunity to purchase and view the film."
3,War story,"Sometimes boring and too long, it is an interesting testimony to history of people winning wars for their feudals of England."
3,where is nanci,This is not a back to roots album. Songs almost strained at times. Not at all typical of listenability of previous varied work.
5,A clock without hands is timeless,"Nanci attains what she has been trying to reach for several years now, an album of insight and honesty that will hook you from the first played notes."
2,WHEN IS NANCI RETURNING FROM VACATION,LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I HAVE BEEN A NANCI FAN SINCE I WAS I8 AND THINK THAT HER FIRST 11 LPS ARE MASTERPIECES IN EVERY WAYBLUE MOON FOR THE ROSES / OTHER VOICES TOO / CLOCK WITH NO HANDS SHE HAS LOST HER KEEN EAR.HER ANGEL VOICE ON SONGS LIKE COLD HEARTS HAS BEEN SWAPPED WITH A TWANGY DISJOINTED SPOKEN LIVE SOUND HER FOLK / POP OR COUNTRY SOUND HAS BEEN SWAPPED WITH A RADIO FRIENDLY FOLK ROCK MEDIOCRATY. NOT A SONG ON THE LATTER THREE CDS HOLDS UP TO ANY ONE SONG ON HER PRIEVIOUS 11 RELEASES.WHO KIDNAPPED NANCI
1,ICK!,"I am a true Nanci fan and have been for 20 years, but I do not like this new CD. I've listened to it several times and even went to see Nanci perform the new songs live at the House of Blues in L.A. last night. The style that made Nanci special in the past is missing from this latest release. I understand that Nanci's work in Vietnam and against land mines is very important to her and I respect her for and support her fully in those efforts. They just don't play well in her music (at least for me). The tracks written by John Stewart are not up to the high standards of Nanci's previous work. The lyrics are typical pop: mediocre and lacking depth. If you are looking for the Nanci Griffith that you know and love, you won't find her here. I do not recommend this CD."
2,A real disappointment,"I've been listening to Nanci's music for years, and this CD was a real disappointment. The music sounds over-produced and heavy on the strings, and the lyrics are surprisingly shallow. If you don't know much about Nanci and would like an introduction to her music, I suggest you start with her CD ""Flyer."" It's a much better piece of work."
4,almost perfect,merch was on the button but arrived later than i wishe it would I will buy from them again and reccomend to friends
5,Great Score!,"John Frizzell has outdone himself with this one! His haunting basslines, along with eerie sounds, make this a definte to anyone's soundtrack collection. Orchestrations and electronics combined bring out the suspense and make you relive the moments from the movie! One drawback, however, is that the songs are not in sequential order based on the movie."
5,Dead-On Score! (no pun intended),"This score is absolutely remarkable! It's so exhilerating, spooky, and exciting! John Frizzell has really outdone himself this time! I highly recommend this album to fans of horror movies and music."
3,Not what I expected,"Just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I wanted the music from the movie, not the music that made the movie. It's still a good cd though, good for background noise when studying."
4,"love message, but preview not entirely accurate","Love this book. Just letting buyers know that if you click the preview key, it is not entirely accurate. The text is smaller and set to the side. One side is journalling. Great if you like to journal. I would like to reread each year, so I would rather text cover the page as the preview shows. I had previewed a friend's book with only the text and enjoyed that layout (personally) better."
5,Very underrated movie!,"I have never seen Dolph Lundgren's movies, so this was a first. This is a well directed action movie and should have gotten more merit for Lundgren. I will say this, Ben Cross was excellent playing Burton! He was a great supporting actor here, and even provided a bit of comic relief in some spots. Just for some FYI, Burton is an arms dealer who is pretty much--a drunk...However, when push comes to shove, he does pull his head out of his backside to get the job done, while trying to keep Lundgren's head down on Planet Earth. If for nothing else, get it to see his performance alone! It totally rocked! Lundgren played the part of the grief stricken, revenge seeking family man well too...While watching this, it brought ""The Punisher"" to mind a bit."
2,a pretty boring action movie,"cliched and stereotyped action movie. lundgren is a mediocre actor, trying to be a director only prolongs his mediocrity but not a new territory. there's nothing special or new of this movie and i just felt quite bored when i watched it."
5,Excellent,This was better than a lot of the big budget action movies that are put out today in the theaters. I think Dolph is like Charles Bronson. He makes good solid action stuff overseas and though he is older he is just getting better.
5,"If you're into building audio power amps, you NEED this bk.","Doug Self's AUDIO POWER AMPLIFIER DESIGN HANDBOOK is required reading for anyone who likes to build or tinker with audio power amps. He goes after the sources of amplifier distortion with a vengence and gives the reader his version of a ""blameless"" amplifier with parts values and device type numbers so that if you choose to try to duplicate his design for a one-off, you can do so. His book is heavily illustrated, (although some schematics were badly smeared in my copy) with lots of graphs and charts showing his reasons for his design. Even if you aren't interested in building an amp, Self's book will help you understand what goes into designing a low distortion power amp. A must have for any audio do-it-your-selfer!"
2,Not much use for any design work G. Randy Slone's book much better,"I purchased this book along with High Power Audio Amplifier Construction Manual by G. Randy Slone.If you want to read about300 pages of information you can obtain free from Mr. Self's website then buy all means by this book because it is a repeat of the blamless amplifier theory, however if you really want a design book with the whyfore's included Mr. Slone's book is the book for you and should rate 10 stars for audio design. I really don't understand why Amazon hyped this book. I should have saved my money I expected more from Mr. Self."
3,Considerations on the book,"The book is very deep in some topics but is very poor in design formulas. The formulas should be included, explained and can be skipped by the readers who are not keen on mathematics.Some schematic diagrams are simply not readable as the printing size, or the book format, is too small."
4,Short Introduction to Spirituality and the Ishayas' Ascension technique,"Since I learned the Ishayas' Ascension technique before I read this book, I think I used the information in it as a tool to better understand the technique. The book is a light introduction to spirituality, human consciousness, and how the Ascension technique can help someone expand their consciousness. It doesn't teach you how to do the technique. You have to do that in person with a teacher. Overall, I like it because I can use it as a reference tool alongside the practice of the technique."
5,Ascension!,"I was always asking myself, ""How much love do I have? I don't know"". ""I wanted to have more love, so then I tried to get the love from outside people and from the church for so many years, but I still couldn't find it.""I learned from this lovely Ascension! Book that Love and healing never comes from the outside in. It always comes from the inside out. As my pattern of thinking started to change, my body and my life started to change for the better. By recognizing the Divine Nature of myself and the field of Love inside me, now I just give my love freely out with Praise, Gratitude and Love.There is so much more in the Ascension! book. I highly recommend it because I just opened up more and more and more. Have a look for yourself and start your adventure.Enlightenment: The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali A New Translation and CommentaryFirst Thunder: An Adventure of DiscoverySecond ThunderOrah The Deathless Dancer, Third Thunder, Book 1 (Fall of Etan)"
2,HAVE TO DIG DEEP TO FIND GOLD NUGGETS,"First of all, far too much psychology 101. Secondly, it has been repackaged/reworded in a very awkward, clumsy way. There are bits and pieces of worthwhile information, but it is buried amongst a lot of nothing! Editing is the worst! Words are out of place, and subtitles are occasionally completely inaccurate. I am using this book for a financial counseling class, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The authors have done a very poor job with this book."
4,yes rare p funk baby,boy you like funkadelic and those menacing guitar riffs you must get this these are 4 funksters trying to get their feet wet in clinton's funky universe they hold their own pretty good produced by long time parliament bassist boogie mosson so you know it's on the one.
5,brilliant,"Invictus is the best heavy metal album that has been released 1998. It's heavy, melodic, rocking and it just bang your head. David DeFeis is one of the greatest Heavy Metal singers in the world. If you don't get this album you miss a lot."
4,Their best Albvum,"While VS had made plenty of solid albums in the past, the stars truly seemed to align on this release. The production is fuller than on some previous albums where it was often thin, robbing the songs of some power. The songwriting and performances are truly inspired, capturing the passion, anger, and defiance outlined in the lyrics perfectly. The sound effects are used well, giving the album a soundtrack quality that suits the material well. Earlier albums never consisntently captured this level of majesty, and later albums, while following a similar formula, have contained more filler material that tend to hold the albums back somewhat (e.g., the rather large number of short 'interludes' on the Atreus albums). 'Invictus' is IMO the VS album most deserving of the 'barbaric romantic opera' label applied to the band's music. Think of the best Manowar albums with more grandeur and less cheese, and you'll have a good idea of what to expect."
4,Does as stated,"This stove can come in really handy even without a power outage. Used it to cook brunch for a crowd. Also was handy during an outdoor BBQ as an extra burner to sautee onions next to the grill. Would be easier to clean if the base around the burner was a smoothe paint rather than dull. Overall, works well."
4,Butane Stove works well!,I was a little disappointed at the thin construction but it does make it light. I have used this to cook on several occasions and it work very well. I purchased butane at a local West Marine for about $6.00 a bottle and my first bottle has lasted 7 15min breakfast preparations.It works well.
4,Camping Rescuer + Gas Not Included,This is a must have product if you are camping and your camp stove runs out of fuel as it did for out group of 33 that visited Yosemite National Park last weekend in the middle of breakfast. I bought it for our many hotel stays with their over-priced and over-crowded breakfast restaurants. It is very clean and packs up like a breeze. I would have rated it 5 stars if it had included a set of butane canisters which I had to order separately from an Amazon partner at a price that was too high when shipping and handling was included. The stove was sent promptly and there were no shipping or handling fees.
5,Couldn't live without it!,"This single burner is great. I threw an outdoor brunch and used it as an omlet station. It also serves as an extra side burner for the grill cooking up peppers, onions, mushrooms or whatever else you can think of. And because it's portable, it goes on picnics and camping trips with us. I have an electric stove and when power goes off, I can still have coffee and heat up some soup. It heats up quickly and hot(10,000 BTU's). It is a lightweight(4 lbs.)and quaility burner. I highly recommend Mr BAR-B-Q."
5,Response to Sara,"The cannisters are readily available here in San Jose, CA at:TargetBig 5 Sporting GoodsMel Cotton Sporting Goods.-Bruce"
5,Great stove,"I bought this gas stove for my home and all I can say is well worth it, I've fried steak chicken fish and cooked curry on this, very easy to clean assemble and put back on carrying case, I bought this to replace my ceramic top because I don't get enough heat and from it, since I've gotten this stove my food has tasted better and my wife loves it also so I'm happy."
5,Response to Sara,"Hi Sara,You can get the canisters on ebay. search for butane under camping/hiking/backpacking section. You can also get them at oriental grocery stores. They usually have them there as they are a favorite among asians. I recommend ebay since it is a sure thing.BTW, this item works great."
3,For Emergency Use,"After losing power for a week after Hurricane Sandy, I wanted to have something like this to cook on should we lose power again for an extended period of time. I have not had the opportunity to use it yet (thank goodness) and still have to get the butane cartridges, but I'm glad I have it just in case."
2,Not the best stove,"I bought thinking to buy the Sterno one, but it was not. It is not even close as far as quality and I did not have a great experience."
1,Portable Butane Stove,"I still did not use this product because I bought it in case a hurricane hits us in Miami and we have an outage in the electricity, but I still don't know where to buy the butane cans. Please let me know where to get them."
5,Best Iron I have ever taken,"I have been taking Iron supplements on and off for years since I was told I was slightly anemic. I started out with the vegetable based ones that you get at the local drugstore. I hated them! I was always constipated and didn't feel any better. Awhile ago I was introduced to Ferritin and I have never gone back to another iron supplement. I have never had a problem with constipation and actually feel good after taking them. I used to get really tired around ""lady time"" and these are the only supplements that I have taken that make me feel better. Don't even bother with another Iron supplement."
3,Avery Labels don't fit,"I agree with Jack Frost in the other review. Funny thing is, these labels with the same template number used to have a perforation on both sides. I contacted Avery and they told me they changed the template so it could fit both a regular jewel case and a slim jewel case. My opinion is that they should have made a separate one for regular and slim, but they didn't. Like the other reviewer, I either use a scissors or only have the label on one side. I have also found that the insert is slightly larger than my jewel cases, so I have to trim them slightly to fit."
3,Difficult Inserts,"Avery 8693 Standard or Slimline Jewel Case Inserts have two inserts per sheet. They advertise a front and back regular jewel case insert per page, or two slimline inserts per page. However, only one slimline insert prints correctly positioned per page, and it prints about 1/16 inch too high, so the bottom of each insert has to be trimmed. The other insert prints incorrectly on the page, and it isn't detachable. (After reading the other two reviewers, I would have taken more time to try and adjust the positioning, and then used scissors.) Avery doesn't include using scissors in the instructions. It's either a cheap shot on the part of the company to get people to use only half of their product and buy more often, or an oversight."
3,Tray Inserts Do Not Fit,"These jewel case inserts will not fit a standard CD case. The perforations for the back tray insert are way too short to fit a standard CD tray. I don't understand how Avery can be so far off on these measurements.Obviously, no one at their factory has inserted one of these in a real CD jewel case."
1,Wrong product,I ordered Avery 8693 Jewel case back inserts but I have just realized that I was sent Avery 8954 Jewel case Booklets/front inserts.Unfortunately I didn't look carefully enough at the product when delivered(the package looks very similar) and have disposed of the receipt.Not a positive experience.
4,Here For You & This Love CD Projects by Deryc,"I make my own original Gospel songs and I make my own CD cases. This product have been a great help to me. And if you are into giving and receiving gifts, then check out: [...]"
1,THIS BOOK DESERVES NEGATIVE 5 STARS,"My little sister got this from her school's library...being a Christian family, I was extremely disappointed that this book contained quite objectionable content- it described a seance and had a medium. I am glad that I read it before letting my little sis read this again. For shame, Harry Allard, that you allow this content in children's books!"
4,Keeping it simple,"Living Naked serves as a valuable handbook for those seriously considering nudism or for nudists pondering moving to a nudist park. Although this book was composed while author Paul Penhallow was terminally ill, he and Marilyn Lovell avoid the pithy sentimentality and stay on-task by guiding the reader through the pros and cons of a decision to live nude. The non-gratuitous profanity relays the author's conversational tone and authenticity. Like the various publications of Naturist Life International, such as the NLI quarterly magazine, Living Naked states a strong case for the benefits of nude living."
5,best book,"This book in my opinion is the best book on introducing people to nudism. The author used a straight forward approach to all aspects of clothing optional recreation. The author, who is on the cover, passed away as the book went to press but contributor Marilyn Lovell works and plays a big role at the clothing optional resort Avalon in Paw Paw, West Virginia."
4,stove knobs,"The knobs were top notch, service was great but knobs didn't fit. My fault ordered wrong size, needed longer shank. Really nice tho.Lux Products Corp 4Pk Blk Gas Burner Knob Cpr410 Range Parts & AccessoriesThanks"
2,Buy real copper,"Doing some renovation on an old home and needed to get a couple more wires run for my polk 7.1 home theater speakers before I started on the duct work....i unfortunately ran out of the good CL2 14 gauge copper wire I ordered from Amazon so I ran down to Slowes home improvement and grabbed the best looking roll of 14 gauge speaker wire I saw. I had to do a solder joint in one spot, while soldering I noticed the wire turned shiny silver. Turns out this is crap CCA wire, which stands for Copper Clad Aluminum. If you need to solder this stuff you are left with aluminum strands which are not nearly as good at conducing electricity when compared to copper. Im pulling all 100ft of this stuff out and replacing it. The sad part is I only spent pennies more on the foot for pure copper.Ive heard to go down (up in cross sectional area) a gauge if you are set on using CCA..."
3,ok but not great,"It does the job ok but the wire material is not great. I was constantly losing a few strands during the connection project. I used banana plugs (GLS Audio, check out that review). Then I needed more speaker wire..........this time I decided to check out the Radio Shack Brand. Theirs is much better. Their wire material is really solid. I never lost a single strand. I would still recommend this product. However, the fact that I was losing a few strands all the time is quite annoying. I dont know if this affects sound quality. The sound seems to be ok."
3,It's just that....speaker wire,"Nothing special. Just plain 'ol speaker wire. It did, and continues to do its job. My only complaint is that the last 10 feet of the roll was cut from the rest of the roll. 50 feet in all, but not a continuous 50 feet. This could have been an issue, but I only needed two 15 foot runs (30 ft. total)."
4,"Good wire, a little hard to use...","Pros: Great value, good quality!Cons: The white marking on the wire is difficult to see, not impossible by any means, but it keeps me from giving this wire a perfect review. It is not an issue unless you are running the wire in a dark area or you are trying to see the white line when hooking the wire to the back of a home theater receiver."
4,good speaker wire,"for my first system, i just matched what gauge wire that was already in my in-wall speakers that came with the house. ratings for the RCA attracted my attention. cutting and connecting were a breeze, but sometimes i'd cut some of the wire strands when stripping off the sheath. i'd probably blame that more on user error (and old tools) rather than the quality of the wire. been great so far."
4,Good Speaker wire,RCA is a reputed company and they definitely delivered a quality product. 100 ft wire was not enough for me so had to buy more at Lowes which was also pretty good quality and comparable price. You wont save any money buying this online as i was hoping to do so.
4,"I was very pleased with this product, it was exactly as I ordered. I would definately do business again",Excellent business experience. Product was exactly as described and shipped immediately. I am very satisfied and will do business again
5,RCA AH16100SN 100 Ft. 16-Gauge Speaker Wire,"This is an excellent Speaker Wire for use with surround sound systems. However, the use of this Speaker wire was for my personal application and cost effectivness. The sound quality is satisfactory for the application. The speaker wire contains a white color coding on one of the 2 wires through out the full length of the 100' speaker wire, to allow for correct speaker & AV receiver connections for positive and negative phasing. This Speaker Wire was used with the Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater Speaker System & Harman/Kardon AVR 520. My Wife thinks it sounds great!"
5,"Great Speaker Cable, Reasonable Price",I got this cable for when I moved my Logitech Z5500s to my parent's house over break. Turns out they carry the signal much more efficiently than the wire that came with the system as the speakers are now significantly louder. One wire has a stripe on it to differentiate it from the other.
1,This is the cheap stuff,"I bought this just to make sure I had something to set up my amp and speakers with when they arrived. I dont know why I was so lazy. I think it was because Amazon recommended it with the other stuff, so I figured all you other jerks who bought it must have something figured out. This stuff is super low quality, its almost impossible to get the plastic housing off without cutting the copper wire inside, its 100% uninsulated, and is just an unneccessary compromise for any stereo system. Get some decent monster cable instead, you'll appreciate it."
3,Works as advertised,Not as thick gauge as I was expecting. I would go with 12 gauge wire the next time to ensure that the wiring is not the cause of any lost in audio fidelity. As for regular speakers this worked out just fine.
3,don't like it but don't hate it......,"I purchased Rocket Fish wires before and I loved it. Since the review was pretty good on this RCA wires, I decided to try this. I suppose it does what it suppose to do but when I was stripping the end, I noticed the copper wires too fragile that they would come off pretty easily. I did not have this issue with any other speaker wires so........But overall, it is ok for money."
2,rca ah1650sn 50 ft 16 gauge speaker wire,"it work,for the price i didn't expect much,poor quality,they break off leaving all the small pieces if you ever gonna take the speaker wires out,maybe i didn't use the proper wire cutter,but it wasn't good quality copper i thought.so we do get what we paid"
4,Works!,Speaker wire is speaker wire and it serves it purpose. I would recommend it to anyone and it will last you for awhile.
3,nice,plastic broke on transportseems good qualityhavent used it actuallyseems legitwhy is it thicker than the wire that comes with the speakers?is it better?i should hop so :p
5,RCA AH14100SN 100 Ft. 14-Gauge Speaker Wire,"Received my package today, I haven't measured it yet but it appears to be right gauge. I will be using in my Camaro for wiring my component speakers. Good price and timely shipping."
4,One one white strip,"The wire met my expectations. My only complaint is that one side of the wire has a pretty subtle white line to determine polarity. It would be nice to have black and red, or at least a color that's a little easier to see. This is pretty minor complaint, and I was happy with quality and cost of this product."
3,Speaker wire,Nice flexible wire. My only gripe was that the last couple of feet towards the inside of the spool was slightly tarnished. I don't know if it was on the shelf for several years or if moisture contacted it before it was spooled. Used it anyway cause I needed every inch of that 100 feet.
4,good wire for the price.,"Not much can be said about wire, but for the price it brings good sound to my awsome energy classic speakers."
2,"Not 100 ft, only about 60 ft.","Like others have pointed out there are not 100 feet of wire here. I should have listened to those reviews because now I have to buy more wire elsewhere. The wire itself is fine, but it is falsely advertised as 100 ft. If you do not need that much wire and are attracted by the low price, this product will be fine, but I believe there are laws against false advertisement. I am not talking about a couple of feet less than 100. There are probably only about 60 feet of wire in this bobbin. How does that approximate to 100?"
2,"Function accurate, measurements not",much shorter than 100 feet. closer to 60 feet. 65 at best. double check foot per dollar on other products before buying.
3,Cheap Speaker Wire with a Few Cons,"I have used this speaker wire on two different home theater builds. It works well enough and it's cheap, but it's not the best quality.Pros:---------------+ Cheap+ 100ft Rolls at a Great Price+ Works Fine for Smaller SpeakersCons:---------------- CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum) Wire, not as good as pure copper wire.- I ordered 16 Gauge but this wire is 18 Gauge, this is misleading and makes the value questionable.- I would not recommend this wire for large speakers."
5,great,great product perfect sound transfer. Using with onkyo home theater surround sound. stock wire wasn't cutting it for my so I ordered this wire and it made a huge difference
2,"Just a few strands in the cable, poor quality","The strands in this wire are very soft. No matter how carefully I clip the plastic sleeve (using my wire clipper or a blade), there are some strands that get broken. While connecting the end to speaker screws, a few more drops off. This is not a good sign. Quality of the wire is poor. Fortunately Amazon return policy is good, I returned this item."
2,distortion with sound,I am getting a lot of distortion in my speakersNot sure if its the gauge of speaker wire or the qualityThere is a lot of hissing noise
5,RCA AH16100SN 16-Gauge Speaker Wire (100 Feet),Purchased this Item after reading reviews on this and other sites about going with 16-guage speaker cables. I had bought a Onkyo 6300 and didnt want to lose any quality. I also wanted to run wires under carpet and the standard onkyo cables were not big enough. good quality . Affordable price. Not sure if it did improve any audio quality but surely required for home theatre installation for behind the wall or under carpet wiring.btw you will never know how easily 100 ft wire runs out.
5,Works very well,Good thick insulation is useful if you are pulling through conduit or around corners. Probably the best deal in 16 gauge wire you will find.
5,Good quality speaker wire.,Good quality speaker wire. I used it to wire my 5.1 surround system and the length was adequate. Cutting and wire stripping was fairly easy as well using a wire tool.
4,Decent speaker wire,This is good speaker wire for the price. I used it to attach my speakers to my home theater receiver and attached banana plugs on the ends to make the connections. Everything seems to work well.
5,Great choice in speak wires,"I've set up a number of houses with entertainment systems and used all different types of speaker wire. Truthfully, I don't have a good enough ear to tell the difference between any of the products I've used. This product is a great value and does the job exactly like it's supposed to. One strand in the coupling is marked with a white line so you can coordinate positive and negative from your speakers to your receiver, but that's standard. They move sound efficiently, what else is there to consider?"
5,Top Quality - Good Price,"I wanted wire that I could install from my home system to the outdoor speakers that I plan to install this Spring. I wanted wire that I could depend on so once I did the install, I would not have to worry about failure in any way. The wire that I purchased is just that. Good quality and good price!"
3,Fine,"I ordered this based on all the great reviews it received after needing more than the 500 feet of Pyle 14 AWG speaker wire ended up being not enough for my project (my bad, not theirs). I got this product a day early which is great and the quality is fine, but for the price I could have gone with 100 feet of the Pyle cable for 18.99 instead of the 23.98 I paid for this, plus the Pyle cable is much nicer and finely braided instead of twisted strands and had a thicker casing than the RCA. Since my project needs to be done in two days I will keep the RCA cable as I know it will be adequate. If I had more time I would have returned this product for the other. There is nothing wrong with this product, it is just that the other is a bit nicer less cost, and all my wiring would match, but no one will notice that anyway."
5,Best deal on here,"Copper is copper. There is no reason to pay for the higher priced ""name brand"" speaker wires. Worked great with my surround sound."
3,Bought it but didn't use it,I bought a theater system thinking I would need wire. I might need it one day. At this point it's hard for me to review something I haven't used yet.
1,this wire is very thin,"This wire is very thin compare to old one I bought from another store , RCA's dimeter is only half more than another. don't waste menoy."
1,Beware CCA,Sent mine back. Your need real copper wiring to get the best sound from your equipment. Copper Covered Aluminum does not do the job.
2,Difficult to splice,"I have used Pyle wires and these RCA wires. In comparison, I'd recommend the Pyle wires. The problem with the RCA wires is that when you try to splice them(split them), you'll peel off the rubber off wires thereby leave wires exposed. Not Good. You have to get the pressure juuuuuust right whereas the Pyle wires you just grab and rip."
3,"Cheap wire , but usable","In this case you get what you pay for. the wire is brittle and hard to manage without breaking but its usable .. If your on a budget this wire will work, however im not sure as to the ""life"" of it. meaning i doubt it will hold up for any length of time.. If your Installing a high dollar system chances are you wont be reading this but if you are dont waste your time spend the few extra bucks."
2,Copper coated aluminum,"Copper coated aluminum, low strand count. Garbage wire; my speakers sing now that I've replaced this aluminum junk with proper oxygen-free copper wires."
3,Hummmm,"I just got an Onkyo and Klipsh 5.1 speaker system. 18 gadge works just fine, but I ordered the 16 gadge just now becasue there is just so much power to push; I don't want to choke it with my tiny 18ga. wire.: )"
3,Did not require.,Did not use wire. Speaker wire included and utilized old existing wire to obviate usage of new wire. Looks good though for future use.
5,"Great, Cheap, Gets the Job Done!",I bought two rolls of 50ft just in case and I am glad I did. The first roll was slightly shorter than 50 ft but I would have still needed to use the second rolls to reach my far back right speaker. All in all a great product. Haven't lost any sound quality and can handle quite the high stereo volume. Definitely recommended.
4,Great price.,I wasn't expecting much quality based on the price but was pleasantly surprised after I received it. Great quality for the price.
4,decent speaker wire,"I much recommend this 16-gauge wire over the thinner 18-gauge wire.(for those not familiar with the numbering system, the smaller the number the thicker the wire).The thickness of this wire seems about right for most speaker applications, and works well with my crimp-on connectors."
5,Works Well,"I bought this for use with my M-Audio Stereophile AV40 reference monitors and laptop, as I eventually figured out that the included speaker wire (which is used between monitors) was not of a very high gauge (if that's the right term; this wire is visibly thicker and nicer looking). I had also hoped to use some terminating plugs, but alas, these speakers don't have a proper receptacle for banana or flex plugs (too small), so I am using only the speaker wire itself after trimming each end of a section of it (carefully). The sound quality seems better now, but I also want to mention that I am using a new Hosa 1/8"" stereo to RCA cable that may have helped, too. Either way, I don't regret this purchase, except that I now have a ton of extra wire (not sure if it's enough for a future 5.1 system, though)."
5,Get value for the price.,This product works very well. Have not had any issues and the sound coming in from these cables sounds clear.
2,Returned product,"When I realized this was copper coated aluminum, I returned this product and bought some pure copper Cables-to-go speaker wire instead. It is worth 2x the price to run a superior conductor, given the low cost of speaker wire compared to the rest of a home theater system."
4,Good Wire,Not much to say...it is speaker wire! Good insulation and properly sized wire. The pricing is competitive and you won't be disappointed.
2,RCA 16 gauge wire,The strands in the wire are very thin and tend to break off. I am still abe to hear the sounds clearly but I am not sure if I am getting the optimum quality of sound.
4,16 gage speaker wire,This wire works better than the ones that came with my speakers. I would have liked to have it shipped quicker.
4,It's wire,It's wire. It's cheap. It seems to work just fine. Hooked up eight speakers with it without any issues. done.
4,Good choice,"Great intermediate level of speaker wire. I wouldn't go much smaller than this unless it was a higher quality, don't expect perfection, but for the money it's great!"
5,Good stuff,"This wire seems to be of nice quality and is wrapped in good supple insulation. Although this is no real indication of quality, my speakers sound excellent when hooked up with this wire. Definitely recommended."
4,id buy it again,Great looking wire hve not spliced it yet but defenatly close to 16guage maybe slighty smaller but still great wire. my spool was broken when i got it but o well.
5,great book for an x-phile,"As usual, a thorough and informnative guide to the 4th season of the hottest show Fox broadcasting has ever had. What would you expect from an official guide? I have to re-examine the guides to seasons 1-3, but I think they went into more details on each episode then they do on the behind the scenes info, then they did in the other books. I could be wrong. Lots of great stuff about the episodes, which, is I guess the point, but I want the behind the scenes stuff, the comments of the writers, how the fans reacted, whether the episode came off as they envisioned it, etc. This book has that, but not enough for me. However, this isn't meant to be a negative review. It's the best book on the subject out there, and an excellent buy."
2,Not enough backstory!,"I love the X-Files, and I wanted to read more of the ""backstory"" of each episode.Instead, most of the book is wasted on the synopses for each episode. Usually, 6 pages is wasted on the story summary, and only one page on the backstory.We don't need 6 pages of story summary for each episode: we can watch that! Instead, give us more on the background! ."
4,An X-pectacular spin-off for X-fans.,"As an x-fan, I did read this book from cover to cover and I found itselft, an amazing book for everyone that call himself and x-philo.This book is very good in everything, execpt for some pictures that were in b/w.... But that doesnt matter when you find, such an x-pectacular piece of art."
4,Great for FX fans,"If you're an x files fan, you will appreciate this book. What I enjoyed was that every episode sypnosis followed the sequence of the television show. What was also great was that it gave background information on every episode."
1,More x-files junk,"A friend loaned me this book in an attempt to get me interested in the x-files. This book is pure junk, as is the show that it is about. I'm just tried of the lame shows of chris carter and I wish people would wise up. This stuff is sheer garbage!!!"
3,Better than you expect,"I have to disagree with the other reviewer. I've been using this shoulder rest for almost a year now and have only had to add air to it one time. It doesn't lose air easily and I don't see how it would ever pop, it's made of a thick material, it's very durable. I have a short neck, other shoulder rests are uncomfortable, they are all too tall. I've used a Kun collapsible and a Mach one before the play on air (deluxe). I've tried friend's shoulder rests at fiddle camps and haven't come across one that doesn't cause neck pain after playing for a while. My teacher also uses the play on air. I do have 2 tiny issues - you do have to hook it the violin just right, otherwise it will come off. But once it's on, it stays on. The other issue is that it's not as rigid as a standard shoulder rest, so it might not be the best for a beginner. I like it, I can practice for an hour with no pain."
4,A book of Pity,"Here, is poetic reportage with a heavy heart. Brian Turner manages to salvage verse from the jaws of madness. Here are difficult songs full of reverence for life, and achingly sensitive to the blasphemy that calls itself war... or,the bloody waste of dealing in what philosopher Bertrand Russell calls ""licensed murder"".Turner faithfully surveys this nightmarish landscape -of obscene unravelings and endgames- and manages to keep awake and spiritually alive by somehow never losing sight of the dignity of others or the immortality of the human spirit."
5,An inspiration to all the men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.,This was the first book of poems I bought and it was a great comfort to me. I have served in Iraq three times and it is great to read something from someone that has been on the ground. This is something every veteran from Iraq and Afghanistan will cherish for years.
4,"Here, Bullet","Very moving poetry set during the ongoing war in Iraq, reminiscent of the best of the poetry that came out of ""The Great War""."
4,Beautiful Sadness,"Beautiful, elegant poems that strike to the heart of the contradictions and paradoxes of the War in Iraq.Haunting images, intricate craftsmanship, writing that hasheart, guts, passion, and grace."
1,Neotextual Material Theory,"If one examines modernism, one is faced with a choice: either reject dialectic discourse or conclude that context comes from the masses, but only if consciousness is interchangeable with culture; if that is not the case, we can assume that the goal of the writer is deconstruction. In a sense, the premise of Sartreist absurdity suggests that society, somewhat paradoxically, has objective value. The example of dialectic discourse which is a central theme of Vidler's Warped Spaces ir Dogs is also evident in Hanfkopf's Narratives of Stasis, although in a more semanticist sense."
5,It's not Christmas Without the Temptations,"I have both of the Temptations previously released Christmasrecordings. I have also bought their newest release of classicTemptation Christmas selections. Anytime you can get one CD ofthe Temptation's vocal stylings with the best of their previoussongs, you must have it! I am a big fan of the Temptations andsee them as often as possible. This CD is magic. It brings meto an innocent time in history and inhances the Christmas holiday. In the terroristic times in which we live a little oldtime peace and comfort, especially from the Temptations is atruely precious thing. Buy this CD. It's the best of 2 rolled into 1."
2,You probably have this collection already!!,"This recent offering is a combination of CHRISTMAS CARD and GIVE LOVE AT CHRISTMAS albums with Eddie Kendricks' ""Hohoho...This is your Singing Santa.."" greeting from A MOTOWN CHRISTMAS CAROL on the first track. The previously unreleased, O HOLY NIGHT is from the post-1971 era. Nice collection if you don't have these CDs already!"
3,Soul Christmas,"This CD is ok, i was expecting more, but it adds to the christmas spirit. its good to have in your collection."
5,Good Music!,"It wasn't Christmas in my household without this cd. Although Silent Night is my favorite, this whole cd is great. It really gets you in the mood."
3,One Standout song,"One great song: Silent Night. I didn't care for the other songs on the album. Silent Night is so good, I gave the album three stars instead of the the one star I would ordinarily give an album where I didn't like most of the songs."
4,Memories,I remember hearing them on the radio when I was a child. Now listening to these songs bring back many wonderful childhood memories.
5,A MUST READ,For those of you who are fans of the original Star Trek this book is a must read. Its a detailed character study of Leonard McCoy told with a richness of detail that is often lacking in tie in novels. It starts ever so slowly then gradually it grows upon you and you find yourself unable to put it down. The last 50 or so pages are worth reading the entire book for. Its unlike any Star Trek book you've seen before. Try it you will like it.
5,Crucible Trilogy: McCoy,"The first Trilogy book written, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of Star Trek: The Original Series, focuses on Dr. Leonard McCoy a.k.a. ""Bones"". I was curious to read this given that we share the same last name. The Trilogy uses the common thread of the ST:TOS episode, ""The City on the Edge of Forever"". This was the first book, in the Trilogy, that I was reading and, at first, I found it slightly confusing. Once I figured out the structure of the story, (think ""parallel universe/alternate timeline""), then it finally made sense. Without giving too much away, the impression the story gave me was the question: ""What if.....?"" I would highly recommend this book and suggest reading this first before reading the second and third books, (Spock, then Kirk), in the order they were written. I feel confident that you would enjoy this."
5,"A very touching, character driven Star Trek novel","While I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekker"" I have seen all the original episodes and the movies. I've read a few of the novels but this is the rare Star Trek novel I consider to be a really good work of fiction. It brings together so many threads in the Star Trek timeline and gives much deeper insight into the personal life of Leonard McCoy. It's thought provoking, well researched and best of all very effective on an emotional level. The only thing to be aware of with this novel is that it does require a good knowledge of the Star Trek universe to enjoy. This is the kind of book that you'll find yourself thinking about for sometime after you've finished it."
2,Smooth but Difficult - Parts Unbelievable,"I'll keep this short. There are spoilers here. Don't read if you plan to get the book.The book has two parts. Things happen in the future, some original, some not. In the past, once it is clear that the timeline is changed, why the heck cannot McCoy help the U.S. government, by providing scientific information? Even after ATL is nuclear bombed, and U.S. is in danger of losing, he putters around. This is not credible, and it is also boring.That's it."
4,Don't Read Many Star Trek Books...,I haven't read many Star Trek books (although I've watched almost all the episodes) but this one is a keeper. The author weaves a great tale and in some parts it's like old home week as he brings back characters from different series and mediums. It became sort of a game to figure out who was who and from what series.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a good read.
3,meh...it's alright,"I like how it's a collection of articles by a bunch of different guys. They're basically a bunch of cheerleaders for HIT training though. If, like most lifters, you've found HIT to be completely ineffective this may not be the book for you."
2,Not so great,"The article by Dr. Ken was very interesting, as was the one by Jan Dellinger from York. After that it went downhill fast. As Svein mentioned, some of the articles seemed uninspired and nearly all of them were b-o-r-i-n-g. Save your money and by something by John McCallum, Bradley Steiner, Bill Starr or Anthony Ditillo -- REAL iron game authors.CD pub9.ezboard.com/bbulkandpower"
3,Some chapters are excellent others are terrible.,"This book contains a collection of articles written by different authors. A lot of articles are well written and make a lot of sense, especially the articles by Dellinger, Leistner and Bob Whelan. There are articles however which I personally think are below standard or in other words are in contradiction with the other articles especially about the squat, deadlift etc. So nothing new there.Bottom line : the book is ok because of the few articles by the authors mentioned but could have been a lot thinner(and cheaper) by omitting some articles e.g the article about back problems, the power clean etc."
4,"""Best"" is the best.","INXS is a fantastic cd. ""Never Tear Us Apart"" is one of the greatest songs ever written."
2,Too good to be true.,My husband wanted this TV for Christmas and the price was great. He figured out why; he can no longer use it effective a year after it was purchased due to the conversion to digital.
1,Warning - limited use of this product - buyer beware,"To my knowledge this product cannot be used as a TV after the switch to Digital TV, the FCC required warning is under promotional items so you may miss it if you don't read everything and I mean everything on the page. Until the switch to digital, it is okay as a small TV."
5,Excellent product!,Purchased this for my mother so that she would not be without a TV when the power goes out. She loves it! Will probably purchase one for our household too!
3,William Martin - Los Angeles,"A portable device with more bulk than expected in size. It performs poorly outside, even with placing it under an umbrella and inside a backpack. I used to own another Casio portable T.V.that performed better and was much smaller. Inside, it fulfills my expectations. Screen is small and you have squint watching. Knowing what I know now, I would not buy again or recommend."
1,Casio SY30 - Disappointment,"I purchased the Casio SY-30 as a Christmas gift for my in-laws and was highly disappointed. Reception is poor, if not non-existent, as none of the main (i.e. ABC, CBS, NBC) TV channels were accessible in their home. It is difficult to manually adjust the TV to locate the stations - you can't tell what station you are turning to since there is just a yellow line that appears when tuning - there's no clear-cut channel identification. Upon returning the item, I did not receive the full value paid for it as selling a TV that doesn't work wasn't Amazon's fault. If you are even thinking about purchasing this item, go to a store so you can get a full refund if you have to return it."
2,"Pass, On This One","Purchased this for use during travel, but screen is NOT viewable outdoors and barely viewable indoors.Reception is poor, unless outfitted with the Xium antenna.The only positives include rugged, handsome case and jacks for external devices, including external antenna.This would have been a much better product if they had included a cowling for the screen; not sure how it can be packaged and advertised for use outdoors when it performs so shabbily under those circumstances."
3,Grew Old too Fast,"Nice writing style.The story however grows pretty old, pretty fast.Could have been much tighter in a shorter format but thus is often the case in the era of the x-amount word novel."
3,I knew this already,"Unfortunately, I already knew this information.However, anyone who is learning to use the Pendulum would find this book helpful.The book arrived on time."
4,Fascinating,"Loved the format and writing style. Very informative for the beginner. Highly recommend this book, as a ""jumping off"" point when exploring the subject."
5,"Two Words ""THE BEST""","All I can really say about this book is BUY IT! I have read about 10 books on pendulums, and without a doubt this book outshines them all.I can't really put my finger on it, but you wont be able to put this book down! It reads so good and has a very good feeling to it. EVERYTHING in this book is interesting for beginners and advanced energy workers. I absolutely love it, and would recommend it to any of my friends. I give Richard Webster an A+ for writing this book, MANY thanks :-)Namaste,DREW..."
3,A great book but...,"This book is by and far the most useful, and complete pendulum guide I have read to date. Richard Webster's writing style is wonderful and this book is full of exercises and excellent real-life examples. Unfortunately, if you want a book on just pendulums, you might be disappointed. He does get a bit off topic toward the end of the book. On the other hand, if you enjoy learning about a variety of things on top of your chosen topics than this is the book for you. I would recommend it to both groups for its completeness on just the pendulum topic. This is truly a fascinating read and well worth the money."
3,Wrong again!,"The CD redux STILL doesn't have the original score to the soundtrack.Remember the scene toward the end where Capt. Williard is brought into the compound after Chef's head was dropped to him by Kurtz, the scene where there is a chorus being heard but also as if Tibetan bells are heard as well?Also the part where Kurtz is talking to Williard, ""you must make a friend of horror. Horror and terror are your friends."" Well, there are those T-bells being heard again.When the credits roll the music of drums and bells is heard. This isn't included in the soundtrack.Those little things that made the movie great is included.This CD is, again, disappointing as the one with the two discs which had the dialouge added. That did not have to happen."
3,Apocolypse: Noun,"Instead of paying $3.99 for a CD featuring ""Ride of the Valkyries"" I bought this whole CD. It was actually a gift for my Father. I think perhaps it might be improved with the addition of more songs from the era that evoke the sense of futility and dread conjured by the film itself...thus expanding the CD play time to equal the length of the Redux...which was in turn only marginally shorter than the actual war. Not necessarily songs INCLUDED in the film, but rather music you know the guys were listening too. All in all, however, it is almost worth the price...it puts you in the same place as the movie, and that's worth something."
1,No dialogue... What's the point?,The original soundtrack had a lot of dialogue. What I was hoping for in this one was more dialogue to accompany the additional scenes. More of Dennis Hopper and Brando/Sheen from the end parts. I would also like some more of the music that is missing as referred to by the other reviewer. This isn't worth much.
3,"Great BUT, NO End Credits music/score","look/listen here;[...]this is what I have been looking for, the 'finale' is not the end credits score.They created almost 6 minutes of music to roll the credits on.....Why on earth would they leave that out?So I dropped it to 3 stars."
4,VIET NAM VET,"This is a great sound track. If your a Viet Nam Vet like I am, get a copy, and a copy of the movie, (I have 4 copies of both versions)"
3,Great first half but loses its way,"This book starts out like a punch to the face. The narrator's son disappears after his father goes down the block for a couple of drinks once he thinks his boy is asleep. The father is tortured not just by his disappearance but by the fact that it was his fault.As the ordeal stetches on, the narrator, Roman becomes numb though the pain of the loss dominates his thoughts and actions. At one point, later in the book, in a conversation with his wife, he says that he always thought a woman would be the great love of his life but in fact it was his 6 year old son.This is a short read and I finished it in less than a day. As a parent of young boys, the first half of the book greatly affected me and I couldn't put it down.The problem I have with the novel is that it doesn't really go anywhere in the second half. I lose some sympathy for the lead character and I get the sense the autor didn't know how to finish.So, I do recommend it but with some reservations."
5,Nicer than I thought,"When this arrived, I was disappointed, and did not think it nearly as pretty as the picture. But as I wore it, I decided it showed up very nicely. I am now quite pleased with it."
1,waste of time,"I have watched many movies in my life and I can say without a hesitation that this movie is one of the worse movies I have ever seen. What makes me sick is that the director thinks it's an art. What was he thinking? I don't see how anyone in the right mind can say this movie is worth watching? I don't normally make comments but after watching this movie I felt the urge to make a comment. I have wasted my time watching this movie, please if you value your money or your time, DON'T WATCH IT."
4,The Bow,"I'm relatively new to watching foreign movies and this one by Kim Ki-Duk is a jewel. The story line is a bit of a stretch; a 60 year old man taking care of a young girl he found lost/abandon in the city, and he is making plans to marry her when she is of age (i.e., 17). I won't tell the story because several reviewers have done more than an adequate job of that already. However, I will say that there is something about this movie that just draws you in. The music is mesmerizing, character development is excellent, and the acting is superb. There isn't a hold lot of dialogue, so those who don't like reading subtitles don't fret. Besides, you can pretty much figure out what's going on anyway. So if you've never seen a Korean movie before this one definitely will not disappoint."
5,The Bow,"Another film by the same director....gotta do the directors remarks to complete the understanding.Great service THANKS A+It is second film by same director, great job of hidden meanings"
5,this is my favorite CD,"This is one of the best medieval music collections I have ever heard. The chosen material is essential for the relative cultural period. The interpretation of music is laconic: exact ('cool', like M Davis' style) and economic. If Paul Hillier's The Hilliard Ensemble was the best in vocal music of the period, Hortus Musicus is the best in instrumental music."
2,Mangosteen Juice,Thought this was 100% Mangosteen. Did not realize this was a blend. OK but not what we expected. Advertisement did not indicate a blend.
3,"Not the pure stuff, but tastes good and is less expensive","This is the type of Goji Juice that purists tell you not to get but I found it to be very tasty and even if it was mixed with other juices,I felt I was getting some health benefits. It's also a lot less $$$$$ than pure Goji, by about $15-$17 PER BOTTLE!!!!!"
1,Not as described!!! It's a blend and it's Not Organic!,"Overall it's not a bad product however I wouldn't have ordered it if it was properly described. It is incorrectly described as organic, it's NOT. It also is not pure Goji juice, it's a blend with water, cherry juice, apple, and pear. If you're looking for the really good stuff stick with the Goji Gold."
5,Mangosteen Juice,"I was leary to try this product, sight unseen, but I'm glad I took the chance. I love the taste. No after taste at all. Yes, I will buy it again. I'm always on the lookout for new and easy to use health products."
4,Best Wash & Wax product I have found,It's been 8 months since I washed the roof on our 2010 Montana Big Sky 34' Fifth Wheel. We had been parked at an RV park with a lot of construction going on that created dust and dirty air.When I climbed up on the roof I could not believe the black spots all over. I have tried several products before but they never do what the label claims they do.I mixed the Camco RV Wash & Wax and started the scrub down. I was impressed on how it removed the black stains. On the real stubborn spots I used some Black Streak Remover.Looked almost like new when I finished and the canopies came out wonderful too.
2,No dazzling shine,"This product works ok, not great to clean but it left no shine on the fiberglass part of the rv. The metal part was better but it is not as good as they say it is."
1,Schweiger,"Big dissapointment. After reading a positive review about Scheigel being the best woman crime thriller writer, what I found was a hackneyed plot full of cliches and 2 dimensional characters. Bought two of her books and barely made it through one."
3,Enjoyable but choppy,"This author's debut novel is set in Chicago my home town. It was interesting to read a book centered in a city I know so well. However, I found the writing to be without flow and very choppy. I found the plot to be rather stale and done just one too many times. The main character I found to be very shallow. Samantha (Smack) has just too many personal problems distracting the reader from the story. Hopefully the author with improve her skills in the next novel."
4,Officer Down,"I liked the main character and the story was exciting and believable.I also bought it because it takes place in Chicago, my home town.However, the ""local color"" was pretty much limited to mentioning street names. I am still looking forward to reading her next book, ""Probable Cause"".....for a good story and strong characters, but not for Chicago atmosphere."
2,First book I haven't liked in a long time,"I'm usually pretty forgiving with books, even music and movies, but I couldn't let this one slip by. ""Office Down"" is just not written well. The main character is a mess of contradictions, claiming to keep her boyfriend (a married man) at a distance, but meanwhile we only see her throw jealous fits and play clingy games. We also hear from other characters that she's a good cop, but meanwhile she leaves footprints at a woman's house who figures out she was there, and she screws up left and right. The characters aren't written well, there's only one redeeming guy, and he's not in it much. And the actual plot/mystery only takes up about a third of the book. Most of the time is spent in the main character's head, listening to her whine and pity herself for no good reason.There are also story threads that go nowhere and not much interesting happens. Pass on this book. You'll thank me."
3,"Tight Writing, But...","The writing is tight and fairly fearless. Schwegel does a terrific job of maintaining a tight, punchy style. But I found Samantha Mack to be a bit of a cliche -- hard-smoking, hard-drinking and insecure about her relationships. Endlessly insecure. I'll leave the deconstruction of the police details to others who know better, but much of the cop work description seemed thin. It does seem as if she is instantly put in the crosshairs of the investigation when most police departments would defer to her version of how her fellow officer was felled. Too often, Samantha ends up back at the bar drowning her woes and tossing back shots when you want her to use her brains and craft. ""Officer Down"" does rip along -- bonus points for speed and efficiency -- and Schwegel's blunt style is engaging."
4,A gritty and fast-paced debut from Theresa Schwegel,"Theresa Schwegel's debut mystery ""Officer Down"" is the gritty and fast-paced story of Samantha Mack, a cop on Chicago's North Side who is forced to confront both the department and the bad guys after a shoot-out with a suspect leaves her partner dead, apparently by a bullet from her own gun.Mack is injured in the firefight and she awakens with a memory that doesn't reconcile with the supposed facts of what happened. When the department and the media want to write off the incident as a case of ""friendly fire,"" Mack is on her own to discover what really happened and prove that someone else was responsible for her partner's death.After a somewhat rocky start, ""Officer Down"" settles down to tell a solid story of a good, though mixed-up, cop in a very bad situation. Although the prose at times is a little rough, it's nevertheless a powerful and compelling first effort that promises good things to come from Schwegel."
5,"Soldier Of Fortune Sega Genesis, ""GEM of its TIME"".","Soldier of Fortune offers something most games of the time could not.Great graphics,Great sound, some of the best on the genesis.Multi-player.Action shooter with RPG elements.Even has a save feature.If you like classics, this is one of the best at the time and is still better today that a lot of games and offers hours of treasures, cool settings, cool enemies, intense fun. Very creative game."
1,"too expensive for what it does, not much",this product is way overpriced. It does smell good though. A similar product that does a good job is there pumpkin cleanser although it doesn't offer the beads.
3,It's Okay,"This scrub works okay. I don't see anything amazing about it, except for the fact that it's minus the harsh chemicals. I'll use it until it's gone, but I don't think I'll be reordering."
5,King of romantic ballads in Europe,"A masterpiece greatest hits collection from Mr.Romance himself the great Bata Illic. Works of art include the melodic ""Hey little girl"", the classic ""Ein souvenir von Marie Antoinette"", the masterful ""Auf der strasse der sehnsucht"" being a cover of ""Answer me"". Bata Illic radiates warmth, charm, kindness and genuine feeling in all his love ballads. Buy this superb CD and play it over and over again to all your friends."
1,Why?,"Why is there no digital download for this anywhere except for iTunes Ireland. I hate iTunes but I'd use it to buy this, except it won't let me because I'm in the US. This is a great movie but shame on the producers for not making this easily available for purchase."
2,Sound track,"This sound track sucks, the songs aren't songs they're clips of music with movie clips attached. What a let down"
1,Don't buy this CD,I really loved this movie. Denzel as always provides the ticket price worth of entertainment. And the movie had some really great music in it. That's why I advanced ordered the CD and waited weeks and weeks for its arrival. What a dull and dreary CD. Song after song...slow paced and repetitive....it actually put me to sleep at a stop light. There were none of the upbeat songs just this long and BORING monotonous blah. Save your money .
1,Hated it!,"I loved the soundtrack while I was watching the movie, but on its own, I hated it. The only song I liked was on Track 1, and that was a very short one."
3,To: Anil Punjabi,The singer is Lisa Gerrard she has her own CD now but was originally a member of the group Dead Can Dance. Her CD is called Immortal Memory. She has composed music for Lord of The Rings also. Hope that is who you were searching for!
1,Soundtrack Is A Shame,"It's a pitty the emotionally expressive songs from the film weren't featured on the soundtrack. I am speaking of the various Nine Inch Nails songs featured in the film credits - but of course, not on this album. Those songs were: The Mark Has Been Made (*The Fragile); The Art Of Self Destruction, Pt.1 (*Further Down The Spiral); Self Destruction, Pt.2 (*Further Down The Spiral); The Wretched (version) (*The Fragile & *Things Falling Apart); The Downward Spiral - The Bottom (*Further Down The Spiral); The Great Below (*The Fragile). Although I suppose Harry Gregson-Williams needs all the support he can get, and I do appreciate the arrangements featured, it is a good soundtrack overall - just not a good representation of the music featured in the film."
2,Huh? Where's the good stuff!!,"I bought this hoping to hear the movies awesome cultivating music and what I got was some mock up of a so called sound track. Where's the music, this sux. Back to Hastings it goes..."
2,Movie sound better,"This is not the movie soundtrack..where's the beautiful classical guitar track and the one at the end with that girl singing all soft and stuff, is that Lisa Gerrard...and wher'es the Nine Inch Nails ""The Mark has Been Made""? that was in the movie... but all the music in the movie was brilliant and haunting..this is crap..."
1,What the...,"I saw the movie, liked the music, thought I'd get the sound track, did and was very sorry I bought it. When they say ""sound"" track, thats what they mean ""sound"" track. There are snipets of ""sound"" 30 or so seconds long on this cd!? Should have known better when I saw the number of tracks. I was thinking there would be, oh... I don't know... actual complete peices of music, like you generally get with most sound track type cds. Oh well, it does however made a nice flying disk."
4,classical piece,"The classical piece that plays while Pita takes her piano lesson is Claude Debussy's ""Claire de Lune""."
2,A Travesty,"I purchased this CD for only one song, Una Palabra by Carlos Varela. It is the very first track. Come to find it is a shortened version of the original song. The full version is 2 minutes and 27 seconds. The version on the soundtrack is 1 minute and 14 seconds. Why someone would want to cut 73 seconds off such a short but beautiful song is a travesty. Why it's madness, I tell you...and my soul demands justice! Luckily I was able to find the full version on the internet, but of course that was $14 later.All kidding aside, it's not a bad CD entirely...if you're into that Harry Gregson-Williams hooty-tooty crap. As a matter of fact, I encourage you to get into him. Just so happens I got a CD for sale if you're interested. Say...$13.99?"
3,Linda Ronstadt,"I know Linda Ronstadt's Blue Bayou is in the movie several times, yet I can't seem to find it on the album. Is that the female voice you were thinking of?"
3,"Really great, but dissapointing...","Movie was awesome + the way NIN was spliced in some places was quite moving. Being a NIN fan I was really looking forward to hearing these mixes.. but they aren't anywhere on the soundtrack - instead it's been substituted. Must be because of expensive licensing fees... dunno - but that was a drag! After 'dealing' with that, and the lack of the LG and LR tracks... it's still good.. but no where near it's potential!It was gutted of 2/3 it's strength"
4,More soundtrack questions answered,"To T. Slane, the song you are looking for is another Nine Inch Nails song, called The Mark Has Been Made, off The Fragile (Right). I think there might have been a third NIN song used, but I'm not remembering which off the top of my head."
3,Was wondering...,"I have the movie and I enjoyed it, but kind of long, but I think the music really intensified (sp) the movie and really backed it up with great drama. There was this moving piece of music (if you call it that) played at least twice in the movie with a great piano piece (reminded me of Chopin feel to it) and I was wondering if that is on the soundtrack.Anybody can help me with this..."
3,which song?,"The part when Denzel is going after The Voice's brother and he has the sawed off shot gun and he starts to enter the house there. The really heavy beat thats going, I am not finding it on the sound track. if it isn't there where can I possibly find it?"
4,"Beautiful photos, but lacking on practical advice","This book is a real treat for the eyes, full of beatiful photos. My only significant complaint is that the information isn't presented in a manner which was useful for me -- I would have preferred a format oriented to specific lessons, or at least clearly identifying the principles involved. Instead, the author discusses the qualities of each photograph and how he created the photo. Don't get me wrong, you can learn a lot from his descriptions, but it takes me some work to understand how to apply what he says to my photographs. One feature of the book I really enjoyed is where the author contrasts two photos -- one good and one not-so-good -- and explains the differences that make the one photo much better."
1,Not good,"The cable never worked with my T290a, as it was never detected in Windows XP. Bad product in my experience and hopefully not many went through the same experience."
3,My 2 year old love this book!,"So, I rented this book from the library recently and my daughter LOVES it! She points out the dogs and call their names. My husband and I aren't impressed with the book. I kinda agree with the below review about the illustrations and the text not matching up. I dislike the ending, a lot. Just doesn't flow right. But, I do like the play on words, I think it's cute and the most important thing is, my daughter is entertained by it. To see the look of excitement and happiness on her face is well worth me reading the book to her over and over again. We'll probably purchase it now."
1,written from a programmers point of view,If you use 3d studio max and intend this book to really help out in those complex scenes..it wont. This book is written for people who want to know exactly how light is mathmaticly computed in mental ray. Half the book is filled with usless equations that most designers would cringe at. The rendering recipes that it speaks of are useless and confusing. Im sending it back.
1,This book has too much code reprinted.,"This book should've been a free html file. There is too many structs and sample codes reprinted in the book itself. I was interested in extracting lightmaps from mental ray, but the sdk that comes with it has this feature disabled."
3,Cool,"I recently purchased an i-zone camera and love it! Even though the frames and albums are a bit pricey,they are perfect!(For what, I have NO clue) This is especially cool if you put a picture that has something to do with snow or Christmas or Chanukah (is that spelled right?)."
1,This chair is a joke for the price.,"I ordered 2 of these blue chairs. I figured for the price they must be okay. I was very wrong. This chair is cheap. The seat is not flat, very high in the front. Under my knees would not take it very long. When you sit down in the chair, a loud stretching sound occurs, and we are small people. When my husband sat in it he almost tipped over. It's light weight and very narrow. Needless to say they are going back."
4,Excellent Sequel,"In Galaxy of Lies, Mr. Woolcott introduced us to Lisa Perry. An unlikely hero thrust into situations well beyond her apparent abilities. In this next book of the series, Lisa has matured into a powerful figure in the galatic swirl of plots and conflicts. Once again she is called upon to save our small world from the machinations of the great galatic powers. But is her solution real? Or is this another part of this well titled book a ""Galaxy of Illusions?"" Woolcott spins and weaves his way through time and space with ease. In this thought provoking sequel we are left to ponder, ""what's next?"""
1,This [is] a rip off,DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING BY THE MADACY LABEL!!!These are sung by poor imitators.
1,Watch out!,"These are not hits by the original artists. Very nice imitations - but these are not the real songs. Listen to the clips to be sure you know what you're getting. ""All She Wants to Do is Dance"" is just a tad too slow. ""Karma Cameleon""'s singer doesn't *quite* have Boy George's tone of voice. Be careful!"
1,Got taken!,I picked this up at the store one day thinking it had some good songs. It does but not by the original artists. (I think I threw it away. Haven't seen in around for a while.) Total waste of money. Get the originals.
1,BEWARE!!!,"As stated in the other reviews... THESE ARE NOT THE REAL SONGS! These are fake, and really BAD imitations of the real songs that you WILL regret buying. The other reviews were way too lenient. These songs are almost laughably horrible. Almost."
2,Does not light up to promise,"While the dragonfly stake is pretty, we are very disappointed that it does not live up to the product description which says that it glows in the dark, our main reason for making the purchase. We placed the stake in the sunniest part of our garden, which has sun all morning and day long, and it does not glow at all. We also purchased the butterfly stake, and it unfortunately does not glow in the dark either."
2,Ok for One Summer,Dragonfly started rusting after one summer of being outdoors. Expensive for not being perfect for a longer period of time.
1,Disappointed,"I bought the Dragonfly stake for my mother this past Christmas. She has a green thumb and enjoys sitting in her sunroom and looking into her backyard. I thought this would be perfect as something to see in the evening. My mother was so excited when she opened it for Christmas, however the small marble ball that rests on top of the larger ball was rolling around in the box because it had come unattached during shipment. But we were able to secure it back on and decided it wasn't that big of a deal. However, I just asked her about it today and she told me that it has never glowed in the dark. She has placed it in several areas of the yard, and made sure to put it into the sunniest spots and it has never glowed. That's extremely disappionting to me, especially because this is a gift. The biggest reason I bought this was because of its glow in the dark feature. I feel like I should recieve a replacement ... that glows!"
3,No Illuminarie,"It has been sitting in the sun for a week now and does not illuninate at night, It is pretty but doesn't work as advertized. I would have not spent $24.00 on it if I had known it wouldn't work."
5,Great product!,I have gotten bumps on my skin with shaving and this product keeps that from happening. I apply it daily after every shower. I swear by this product!
1,Rip Off No Bump,Main ingredient is alcohol. Charge you $7 for $1 of rubbing alcohol! I fell stupid for having bought it. Don't make the same mistake.
1,Opened/Used bottle,I received a possibly used product because the bottle was opened. All i can smell was the alcohol - 100%. I can't tell whether the product is legit or safe to use. It was opened after all and after pouring a little liquid on my finger tip all i can smell was alcohol. This could have been used and replaced with nothing with rubbing alcohol. I looked at the label and there is a warning of a possible reproductive harm or birth defect for using this product. Apparently the warning is only applicable in the state of CA. I poured the whole content under the sink drain and throw the bottle in the trash. Needless to say i wasted $13. I shop a lot of Amazon and this is the 3rd product i am not too happy about in the last month. Amazon need to do a better job of weeding out dishonest sellers.
1,Didn't work for me,I followed the instructions but it never worked for me. The smell is terrible (as expected- its all chemicals). Everyone is different so hopefully it will work well for someone.
5,Keeps underarm razor burn away!!,"I love this product. It works great for underarms. Dab a little on with a cotton ball, and it will keep the burn/bumps away. I try to use it every day, but if I don't have time, I at least use it the day of and day after I shave. I have mixed success with the bikini area. It works okay in that area. It seems as though the razor burn isn't as bad; however, I do still get razor burn there sometimes."
5,Just what the name says!,"I have used EVERY product on the market to prevent & treat bumbs in my bikini area after shaving or waxing. Some products worked for a while then failed after use over time. No Bump has continued to work consistently after every wax & shave. I am bump free, smooth as a baby's bottom, no ingrown hairs...nothing! This stuff is fantastic! I use it daily after showering I apply it with a cottonball. Just ordered another bottle to make sure I don't run out."
5,"Finally, something that works!","I can't say enough about this product! It's inexpensive and works well to soothe your skin after hair removal. No more red spots or irritated skin and far less ingrown hairs. The red bumps literally go away in a couple of hours, and although it says to apply daily to help maintain smooth skin I did not reapply and have had no problems. Sometimes I get a stinging sensation when I put it on, but it fades immediately and leaves me with a cooling sensation that feels great. I'm in a bathing suit all summer and I know this year I won't have to worry about bumps on my legs."
3,Overpriced for its ingredients,"I have been using this product religiously several times a day and can estimate the majority of my razor bumps and igrown hairs along my bikini area will be gone within a week or so. This is definitely not an overnight fix, but definitely helps. The reason I'm not giving this product a 5 star, and this review will apply to the more expensive ""Tend Skin"" brand of no bump treatment is because it's basically a mixture of water, isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol, costs $0.87 at a drug store for a large bottle) and aspirin. So paying $7 for a teeny 4 oz bottle is ridiculous, now that I have a bottle I'll mix my own solution and it'll be a nice home remedy for bumps :)"
3,No Bump,"This product works fairly well, not as good as the Tend Skin aaddiction that I was hoping to replace. The cap is also difficult to close so I leaked half of my bottle into my hair products area where I was keeping it. It tingles after using it but takes a bit of time to dry."
4,Women: Be cautious,Works great for my wife. The only thing negative I have to say about this is it has a warning on the label that it has chemicals that may cause birth defects.
3,Overpriced..save your money!,"I tryed GIGI No bumps after my Brazilian, it seemed to work, burned a little. Product is way over priced. I later found out from a friend that Witch Hazel works just as well and cost less, wish I had known that beforehand! I use Witch Hasel now and never have bumps or ingrown hairs."
3,"Good product, poor shipping","The product is what I wanted, but it was shipped poorly and 1/3 leaked into the package."
4,Just something to consider.,"I purchased this guide recently, and don't feel I got my money's worth. It is a valuable tool, yet most of the information contained within is already listed on websites like wwww.l2orphus.com. There are multiple typing errors - some paragraphs aren't even complete, and it appears whole sections are missing, - like in the Dark elf section they don't even discuss the Shillen Knights in depth like they do the rest of the other class choices. To correct; it isn't discussed at all. Though overall I guess these details could be labeled minor - I still don't think this is worth the money so look around before you buy it I am sure you will be able to find the same information online, for free."
1,not great,"This book has some general tips and information. there is no in depth information concerning quests,maps, or anything that is really useful in playing the game. I wouldnt waste my money on it if i had to do over again."
5,Discusses all the elements which make a web site a success,"How does an online business keep its customers when the competition's only a click away? From assuring customer satisfaction through personal emails to simplifying a Web interface for quick and easy navigation, this discusses all the elements which make a web site a success - or a failure. An essential guide to e-commerce businesses."
1,HQRP Battery Replacement 263897001 233488001 for HP Compaq,"Awful. Never worked. Would not buy again. When I received and inserted it, it would not work. I sent an email to the person and they said just take it out and put it back in, it still never worked. Very disappointed."
1,Doesn't keep accurate time,"My experience with this clock wasn't good. It couldn't keep accurate time. I don't mean that it was a few minutes off. What I mean is that when I set it to the correct time at night it would be 45 minutes ahead by morning. I know it's a cheap clock, but I thought we had figured out how to be at least a little more accurate than that.The radio was pretty cheesy, it was difficult to get it tuned to a radio station. While the tuner dial was large, it was just too hard to tune the radio (at least for me).All in all, I wouldn't recommend this clock radio even as cheap as it is."
5,10 YEARS AND STILL GOING STRONG,"Yes, you read that right. It's been 10 years since I bought this alarm clock and although I've bought a couple of others I still go back to this one.I have the option of a radio or regular beeping alarm dual-alarm with this clock which is very useful. The green LED is also great even when my alarm clock is all the way on the other side of my bedroom. If you need a basic but very durable alarm clock then this is what you're looking for. I've included other great alarm clocks I've used (and that my family has or is currently using) over the years.Sony ICFC414 Clock RadioSony ICF-C318 Automatic Time Set Clock Radio with Dual Alarm (Black)Now, if only I can stop pressing the snooze button and actually get up in the morning."
1,The worst alarm clock ever,Like another reviewer said this clock does not keep time. I'll set it at night and it will be at least 45 minutes fast when I wake up (45 minutes early!!). The radio is horrible and only gets a handful of stations.If I could give it 0 stars then I would!!!
2,Reef Ecology,"This is a great book as an introduction for reef ecology. However, if you are planning a trip and want a resource book to identify different kinds of fish and fauna, there are others that are more helpful. If you are experienced or knowledgeable about oceans, this is NOT the book for you. This book for me was not what I expected. Since this book was out of print, I did not have a choice to peruse it before purchase."
1,Beware,"Purchased vacuum new in March of this year - suddenly stopped working. Took it to an authorized repair shop 5 weeks ago. I was shown an entire room full of the vacuums that were waiting to be exchanged - seems the repair rate on these vacuums is high and because of the technology, the vacuums are usually replaced instead of being repaired - or so I am told. At any rate, it is 5 weeks later and I still do not have a vacuum."
3,Nice and quiet,The vacuum works really well to clean medium to low carpet in my apartment! It is quiet so I can clean at night and not disturb my neighbor up and below my room.The only problem I found so far (using for 2 months) is that it doesn't turn very well. You have to do quite a bit of lifting and repositioning the vaccum to turn the unit.
2,Would not purchase again,"We bought one of these about 2.5 years ago. Until last week, my only real complaints were: 1) it's fairly heavy at 27 pounds, and it can't ""sit"" on stairs like some other canister vacs, so lugging it up & down my 2 flights of carpeted stairs got old fast; and 2) the wands are oval in cross-section, not circular, so you can't swap out old tools - something I have been used to doing with different generations of vacuum cleaners.Last week, though, it died. First the carpet brush stopped working, then the suction stopped, and finally all power to the canister disappeared. Sears has a fixed-rate labor deal of $59.99 + parts, but if it's the fuse, then evidently we'll have to spend $130 for a new circuit board, and at that point I'd rather buy a new vacuum cleaner. I'm going to try to talk my husband into going through the fuse repair instructions at [...] first...."
3,"Good suction, but clip that holds handle upright broke after a couple of months","The suction on the vac is great, but the quality is not up to the usual Electrolux quality that I've come to expect over the years. Something snapped after a couple of months of use and the handle will no longer stand upright. This is a real inconvenience; and I'm sure way too expensive to have to ship it back for repair."
3,Whisper Quiet?... not quite...,This Electrolux vacuum is alright... but the PowerHead is not quite as quiet as I thought it would have been... otherall a good vacuum.
2,"The product was defective, the brush and light did not work from day 1. The repair shop took 11 months and still did not work!","The product was defective, the brush and light additional part did not work from day 1. The repair shop covered under the warranty took 11 months to ""fixed"" awaiting for the part to be ship and still did not work! It vacuums ok but not as it should. The bags are not cheap. What a shame!Electrolux Oxygen Canister Vacuum Cleaner, EL6988EZX"
2,Not so great,Had this vacuum 2 years. It died while I was vacuuming. Pros: is it is quieter than my old hoover. Cons: the cord is too short and didn't retract well. Bags fill up quickly as they are small and expensive. It is hard to control when pulling. The floor attachment is to big. The attachments are easily knocked off the wand. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum.
2,beater brush will not turn,We purchased this vacuum about a year ago. Now the beater brush will no longer turn. We have taken it apart and completely cleaned the brush but it still does not function. For the price I would expect it would last longer.
2,2 years than dead.,"Got 3 years from this vacuum. Then it stopped turning on due to an issue with the electronic remote control. This vac should have lasted much longer. Local vacuum shops will not repair it for a reasonable cost, so I am junking it. This could have been a good vac had it lasted longer."
4,My New Electrolux,I like this electrolux; it works well and it cleans thoroughly. It is a little tricky learning how to manuver it; it's not as easy as the old traditional electrolux I've used for years. It takes a little getting used to it; that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. The handle is a little thick and slightly difficult to use. The machine works very well and the house feels so clean after I use it. Electrolux products are excellent; I used my last electrolux for over 30 years and it's still running.
5,Excellent Vacuum,I've had this vacuum for several years now. I love it. It is extremely versatile and works great for a house with hardwoods and area rugs in every room.
1,Bad purchase.,"It may be the vacuum cleaner I received, but I do not think so, but the carpet attachment is the most (I don't know the word to describe). It will run a minute with the brush, and does not run at all when you pull back on it. It will eventually get your floor somewhat clean if you have the patients to work with it. Joe Ann Camp"
2,ITS A FAKE!,This is NOT the Electrolux that you've know for quality. The owner of Eureka (some European company) bought the name Electrolux some years ago and the change is just taking effect. The Electrolux that you've known for quality is now Aerus. The name Electrolux may still be with Aerus name but it is required to be smaller than Aerus by agreement. The name was purchased to dupe American buyers...its just an Eurekavacuum.
1,Not your Grandmothers Electrolux,"While the suction is very good, the ""power nozzle"" is a piece of junk. We've had two now and they quit working just after the warranty runs out (90 days). A call to Eletrolux customer service will convince you they have no customer service. E-mails get you nowhere.We will never buy another eletrolux product. Made in China says it all!"
2,"Nice vacuum, horrible service!","After 2 1/2 years the joint connecting the power head to the hose broke completely. You can buy the replacement part, but the service and info are horrible. Buy another brand."
5,Best Vacuum EVER!,I have four cats and can attest that this is the BEST VACUUM EVER! You can even vacuum ceilings & corners with the telescopic wand. Takes fur right off of furniture. Carpeted stairs are clean in a jiff. This vacuum is my new robotic cleaning friend.
3,Not very impressed,"I have found that this vacuum is a bit heavy and cumbersome. I've had it less than a year and the power cord no longer works. Also, I find that when I have the sweeper ""on"" while vacuuming the hardwood floors, it seems to just spit dirt around rather than pick it up. I just don't think it's that powerful. I'm disappointed and shopping around for something more lightweight, quieter and thorough."
3,repair in less than a year,"This vacuum is quiet and does a good job, but in less than a year the power did not come onHad to repair and was told that the hose connection had shorted.That was a disappointment especially because of the pricing on this model"
2,Repaired more than used!,"I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. Perhaps it is shame on me for ordering such a large item from a place like Amazon, either way this vacuum has been in the repair shop more than it has worked. The first time it broke was the 3rd time I used it about 4 days after I received it back in July. It has broken 2 more times since then. I am returning this product and not purchasing another one. It will have to be Dyson or maybe Kirby from now on!"
1,It may be good if it works,"I've used this product for one month and it stopped working, dead! It passed the Amazon return period so I had to go to a factory rep to have it fixed. Well one month later I still don't have my vaccuum!! Electroluxsaid it would take a month to get the part. $500 for a vaccuum that doesn't work and a company that doesn't seem to care. Buy a Miele."
1,very disappointed,"Bought this vacuum from amazon five months ago, it's already died. Really expected more from electrolux - I'd never buy another one. The bag inside is awfully small, so it really doesn't hold much. I've got 2 cats, and it did a fair job of cleaning, but the vacuum head is pretty large and bulky and it wasn't anywhere near as good as the miele that it replaced, which managed to last for 6 years. Awfully disappointed in this vacuum."
1,More Money Doesn't Guarantee Quality,"We just purchased the Electrolux ""Quiet Clean"" Canister Vacuum, model Oxygen3. It is sleek, it is quiet, but unfortunately it's also not working. The vacuum works, but the ""Power Brushroll"" died only moments after its maiden voyage onto our carpet. We have verified that it isn't ""Jammed"" or user-servicable, it's just dead. We expected a $400 product to be free from these kinds of aggravations. We called Electrolux and got our closest ""Warranty Service Center"" which was anything but close. The gentleman we talked to at ""Vacuum Zone"" told us they weren't interested and to return the entire unit to the place we bought it from. I can see resolving this issue is going to be time-consuming and it's going to cost us money. Do not buy this product. Buy a vacuum from a brick-and-mortar store, and don't expect it to work no matter how much you pay for it."
1,NEVER BUY FROM ACE PHOTO & DIGITAL,"In Sept '06 I purchased what should have been a new Electrolux Oxygen3 Ultra Canister model 7020A from Ace Photo & Digital in NYC. It worked great until 1/5/07 - only 5 months old. Took it to an authorized Electrolux repair shop only to discover it had NO serial no. sticker on it's underside. Electrolux won't cover under their 1 yr warranty because this looks like I never had a NEW unit to start with. I feel totally ""taken"" by Ace Photo for sending what appears to have been a used or rebuilt product, as it had no serial number sticker(hard to remove I'm told). Amazon.com normally deals with reputable companies, but I definitely recommend that everyone (including Amazon) not do business with Ace Photo & Digital in Brooklyn,NY. This is an expensive loss from a bad experience of daring to risk purchasing a major item online."
2,Heavy yet fragile!,"This was reviewed well by Consumer Reports but (1) is very expensive, (2) very heavy to use, and (3) fragile - the nozzle broke after a few uses. I would not buy this again!"
2,Disappointed With Carpet Performance,"We have owned the vacuum for a few months now. We liked the positive reviews on allergen control and low noise performance of this model. If you're looking for a unit for light use, especially for use on floors the rating would be higher than given here; but we really needed a vacuum that could handle carpets. This unit is not at all acceptable for use on carpets. The head does not adjust to carpets well and it takes a lot of work to vacuum carpet. The power head is rather small too, which means it takes longer to cover a larger area. I really wish that others had provided this information when we were shopping, in hindsight we paid a lot of money for a vacuum which performs so poorly on carpets. Our recommendation to anyone who is considering this model is to go see one in person and try it out on the types of surfaces you will be cleaning."
4,LOVE IT!!!,"I own a cleaning business and hunted many many vacuums. This one has the BEST suction I have EVER come across!!!! It si absolutely AMAZING! The only downfall is the ""floor brush"" to attach does not work.. It worked when I first bought it, now it doesnt, this could just be something I am doing wrong (I hope).But other than that this is my absolute favorite vacuum I have EVER used. Vacuum your carpet with a vacuum you THINK it amazing, then use this Electrolux right after and you can hear all of the firt it is sucking up! Absolutely amazing!The only other downfall is that it is not bagless.**Highly Highly recommended!!** (from a cleaning professional!)"
1,Short Life,"The vacuum was used about 20 minutes per week but only lasted about 3 years before electrical connection in the swivel portions of the hose started to fail. (We went through about 4 or 5 bags in the entire life of the vacuum.)Pros: Was fairly quiet, good suction.Cons: Very short life due to poor design/constuction of electronics.Summary: Will never buy an Electrolux again."
3,Really like it,"My last vacuum cleaner was an upright and was heavy to lug around etc. This canister vac is much easier to move around, do steps with, and vacuum out vehicles. Has great suction. Bags are small, but not expensive. We returned the first one because we could not turn it off without unplugging. Amazon was very good about replacing it quickly. Unfortunately it was not a problem with the vac, but with our wiring! Don't know about durability as it's only been about 3 months. Would choose this over a Kenmore.Update July 2012- Agree with ""great while it lasted"". It has not been a durable machine. Replaced the beater bar several months ago, now it suddenly quit in mid-vacuum and won't run at all. The lights don't even come on. We have had this vac for less than 2 years."
2,Heavy and not easy to use,"I bought this vacuum because I thought it is quiet and light. In fact the carpet brush is very heavy and loud, it is difficult to get to the corners. It looks good and has rather good suction but it defenately is not what I call money well spent. I was looking to get Miele Luna which I used before and I should have done it. Overall it's not your favorite vacuum and I would never get it as a gift."
1,Disappointed,Thought this one would be worth the money. When it worked properly it was great. After about a year the vac only vacuums if you are going forward. As soon as you pull back it stops vacuuming if you press down hard it will sometimes keep vacuuming when you pull back. Don't buy this one. I regret it.
2,Stopped working after 8 months,I looked online to find this item (based on reviews). I use it only 2x per month in a vacation home. It stopped working after 8 months.It worked well until it didn't!
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I learned something very interesting just a couple of weeks after purchasing this vacuum when the canister latch failed: it is NOT a genuine Electrolux. I found this out when I called my local Electrolux dealer about fixing the latch. If you want a genuine Electrolux machine make sure it has the circled ""R"" after the name, indicating it was made by ABS Electrolux of Sweden. It is my understanding that such machines cannot be purchased online. The name ""Electrolux"" is now used by Eureka and the machine you see here is a Eureka. When my local Electrolux dealer told me they don't service this machine, they recommended a shop that did. That second shop told me they could do the warranty work on this machine, but added, ""we'll be seeing you a lot."" Fortunately, this all occurred within the 30 day return period and I have since returned this machine to Amazon."
2,"poor design, breaks at the neck","Does a good job of picking up dirt, but... the powerhead is very heavy. Ours broke at the neck, about two months after the expiration of the warranty. I called a vacuum repair shop, who told me that ""they all do that"", but that it is reparable. Which is not good for a machine that is as expensive as this one."
2,Bag changing is a problem,This vacume works well as a vacume but when it comes time to replace the bag it can be a daunting task. Once the bag holder is properly place the cover wants to pop open and this gets to be very frustrating.Papa Dale
4,"Once The Kings,Always The Kings","I bought this book when I was in college and it soon went out of print.Thankfully it has returned.Despite a few mistakes in song lyrics, this book faithfully follows our leather clad heroes from childhood to stardom to superstardom.The story ends however at the release of the disasterous yet still somewhat entertaining film ""Tougher than Leather"".So kick up your shell-toe (no laces,please) adidas and enjoy a long overdue piece of rock and roll history."
4,Dries fast,"Smells good, dries fast, doesn't streak, but haven't noticed too much of a change, which is probably good. ""Gradual"" isn't supposed to be overnight!"
4,"Weird, Wild, and Wacky","This game is hard to classify...actually ""game"" is not really correct...Basically, you just swim around a vast underwater environment...you explore and occasionally find some cool hidden areas (such as a sunken ship). You can ""interact"" with the sea life and fish by sending several sonic pulses using your PlayStation controller. That's pretty much the entire game. It may sound boring -- and for some it will be -- but I am strangely addicted to this odd game. It gives me the creeps to explore the underworld...but I like it. You never know what you stumble on next..."
4,"Cute, but Needs Improvement","These keychains are a great way to display your i-zone photos. It was a little bigger than I expected, 2"" x 2.5"". The photos slip through a slot at the end, near the chain. I think the ring is a little close, and I'm afraid that I might accidentally scratch my photos when inserting them inside. The only other problem I have with it is that there is nothing (clear plastic, etc.) to protect the photo from scratching and the elements. It's nice, but it could be better."
5,Great job!,I had a great experience. This item arrived on time and as described. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again. Thanks!
5,Purchased for our 17-month old grandson,"The Lego box was in great shape, it arrived promptly, and our grandson loved it! He's a little young for Bob and Builder, but he loves his Duplos! I appreciate it that I can purchase Lego sets on Amazon that are not available for purchase in our retail outlets."
2,Ok for a specific audience,"Guys, if you're significant other is timid and you are looking to boost her self confidence and add some spice, this is where you need to go. It's geared to not intimidate and to encourage the faint of heart. However, if you're looking for something new (or even specific)...keep looking. The instructor's focus seemed to be on getting in touch with your inner self and doing what feels natural. Uh, do you need a DVD for that? She talks about empowering yourself. I believe that its just a difference in philosophy. She seems to focus on how to please yourself. I am most pleased when he is pleased. And... the CD sounded like elevator music.One may find Nina Hartley's Guide to Stripping for Your Partner more helpful."
1,"omg, im so mad","for one, somewhere in the discription you could have put that you had to build it, it doesnt really work, and it looks nothing like the picture on display!! The colors aren't even the same! I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Come on Guys!,"This book is produced by pretty much the same team that produced the excellent ""Rio for Partiers"". Surprisingly, it has much the same content - literally. It also is riddled with so many typographical errors, it appears as if it was assembled in a careless, mad rush. There is relatively little here on Salvador or Bahia and what there is lacks the knowing sophistication of the Rio book. Come on guys, do a second edition and do it RIGHT."
4,"The inside view of Salvador, not just for partiers","This book was very helpful for my recent trip to Salvador da Bahia. Because I was given the inside view I didn't have any surprises, it prepairs you for the foods, the people, the taxis the beggers, everything. The book does have a lot of typeo's and some missing page numbers. That is made up for by the humor and the vivid pictures. It is a very quick read, but very informative and helpful, for everyone not just partiers!"
2,Interesting book but not edited correctly,"Lots of information. Some quite funny and very useful. Needs to be edited properly with many items from 'Rio for Partiers' accidentally copy and pasted into this book and many page references filled in with 'See page???'. Info on nights out and places to go is also a little out of date with venues and events having changed almost 2 years ago.If you want info on local food and drink or best tourist sites in Salvador then buy this book. If not, then don't bother."
2,"Excellent concept, but a failed project","I am an avid supporter of female athletes. That is why I decided to give Mia Hamm Soccer 64 a try. Unfortunately, unlike Mia Hamm, this game falls very short in execution: the controls are stiff, the announcer (with all due respect to Wendy) is too repetative, the graphics have a very low polygon count, and every athlete looks the same except for skin color. I admire South Peak Interactive for making what is apparently the second sports video game to star a woman (the first is Jennifer Capriatti Tennis for Sega Genesis), but they should have done more to make this game fun to play. Here's hoping they try again, but this time REALLY TRY."
3,this game has good graphics but gets boring,This is the maybe 6th best soccer video game I have ever played. It is nothing compared to FIFA '99. The game moves slowly and it becomes very bland.
5,Wonderful book!,"I lived in Belize for two years and was fortunate enough to travel extensively throughout southern Belize, the Toledo district that this book brings to life so well. The time that I spent with the Mayans in the region impacted my life dramatically, to the point I wrote my own book concerning my time there (""Following Mateo"" by Tom Molanphy, available through amazon.com and trafford.com). The Maya Atlas was an invaluable resource for me while trying to portray a fair picture of the Mayans of southern Toledo; in fact, it was the only book I found that focused exclusively on the Belizean Mayan lifestyle and the challenges to that lifestyle. Full of wonderful color maps and photos, this books tells the story of Belize in the words of Mayans themselves. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn about a fascinating and endangered culture."
3,Looking for John miles original releases after 1995,"While this CD is very good , it is not what I was expecting. I heard John Miles on an Andrea Bocelli (not sure of spelling) Album. His voice was kind of like Springsteen. Sexy, raspy and very unique. The Master Series John Miles voice I'm hearing is clear and pure, but not the same voice I heard on the Bocelli album. This voice ( from the Bocelli Album) blew me away! I'm hoping to find recent ( not reissues) John Miles work. Thank, Susan."
5,PURE SATANIC BEAUTY!,"This album is like most Black Metal albums but the thing that makes it so unique is the fact that it's pretty 'mainstream sounding', but STILL maintains that sombre, deep, heavy pounding sound. Such talent that most haven't heard..Won't U be one of the first!"
5,"Charles by Charles David Women's Savoir Platform Slide,Black Patent,5.5 M","I like the shoe very much, it fits well. It does not hurt when I wear it."
2,Not much help for 1st time home buyers,"There are 53 so called power tips for buying low in any market. Many of the tips are not suited for ordinary folks. Chapters such as ""Buy sight Unseen"", ""Look for Fixer-uppers"" ""Look for Foreclosure and REOs"" are aimed at seasoned RE investors. Even for the seasoned investors, they are not very helpful since the content is simplified without details. Home buyers are better off without these ""power tips"""
2,Replacement cap,"The replacement cap for the 'lightweight' vaughan hammer is a great idea, However, the hammer is too heavy to be touting itself as a lightweight hammer. I will keep mine to use for demolition and concrete work."
5,"Practical, no-nonsense guide to really doing it.","Product Design and Development is a very practical, tools-based book. It is written in a way that each chapter can be used on its own (e.g., identifying customer needs, generating product concepts). We require all of our new engineers and designers to read the book and ask them to adhere to the methods associated with several of our ""stage/gate processes."" This is not a high-level strategy book; it tells you how to do product design and development in the trenches. Excellent book and worth every penny."
3,Rewiewing for refreshing the knowledge,I have found this book very informative. My best section of the book is from chap: 11 to chap:12 which are on Economics of and Managing product development projects respectively.
1,Complete garbage,"There is no option for zero stars? I wanted something to replace the headphones that came with my MP3 player that were cheap, comfortable and sounded good. These only fit the bill for the 1st two criteria. I ordered these based on the reviews. Boy, were they wrong. The sound is utterly and completely unlistenable. The sound is similar to an AM transistor radio from the 70's, and the jack is one of those that if you touch it, you get instant distortion. Please, DO NOT waste your money like I did. Right in the trash these things are going."
1,disappointing,"I'd first like to say that I have had the same type of headphones in the past. So, I knew what these headphones should feel and sound like, but the Coby headphones are a disappointment. Don't waist you're money... These headphones are not worth it."
3,Comfortable but floppy,"I don't like earbuds so I need the over the ear deal. I thought I'd like it better without the headband, but I was wrong. It's floppy the ears, so if you're running, they'll bounce. They won't sit flush against your ears so you won't get great sound out of them. If you're laying out, one or both might flop away from your ears. Having that on your mind while you're trying to relax and not think about your earphones isn't fun.When pressed against your ears, they sound great. These with a headband to keep them in place are perfect. I recommend one of those, not one of these."
4,DJ-20 jointer blades,"I purchased these to tide me over until my carbide blades were sharpened, but they have held up for a number of board feet of white oak. I would just like to say that I have been more than pleased with their performance. I would give them five stars, but they are not carbide and they will never last as long."
3,disappointed,"This dryer has multiple heat settings, but only one speed. The product description didn't say it had only one speed."
3,Oster Dryer hi-velocity low Hi,I was disappointed with the temperature of the equipment. There is no much of a differencebetween one temperature and the other.
5,A little goes a long way!,"This cream is not too greasy but yet is moisturing. I mix it with the Serum C and it is perfect!Also, one jar lasts me for 3 months. However, at night I allow my face to ""rest"" by not using any moisturizer."
2,Save your money,"Save yourself some time and money and do not buy this awful video. This trainer gives absolutely little or no cues at all....and when she does, they are very confusing. At one point I was ready to give up, not because it was too hard, but because it was confusing and was moving to fast! If you read the reviews on Netflix, you will see others who share my opinion. In my opinion, Ellen Barrett is a much better instructor. Look for anything with her in it...especially in the ""Crunch"" and ""Self Magazine"" DVD series."
2,Not What I Expected from Liz,"I am a huge fan of Liz Gillies but this DVD did not hold my interest at all. It seemed rushed in sections and she was frequently off-beat with the music she chose. Some of the moves were similar to those in her Progressive Pilates series but not as effective, in my opinion. She doesn't cue as well as she usually does. I really wanted to enjoy this one but unfortunately I can't. The bonus section was okay but just a tease. Just when you really start to enjoy the toning, the session is done. Well, I will just continue to use and enjoy her Progressive Pilates DVD's until she comes out with something else worthwhile."
5,11th Hour is Here!,"These North Carolina lads are onto something here. They combine a punk passion with rock and roll roar into a brew I hope they'll continue to stir on later albums. Two tracks standout: ""Pain on Tap"" and ""Cold Blue Sea"" are rousing, sing-along anthems just waiting to be discovered by newcomers. ""Last Train"" closes out the album with a rootsy country spirit. If you like the gritty working man's inspired rock but are tired of the poseurs and celebs that can't pull it off, pick up ""11th Hour""."
3,works,The vac u lock is a bit of a pain. Only had the harness so don't know how it works on other vac u lock things.
4,"To save Figaia,or not to save Filgaia!","When the demons seek revenge and the world is starting to go through choas who do you yell for, The wild arms gang.This is a great RPG if you liked the old SNES RPG's then you'll really like Wild Arms it has ok graphics but if your a person who really cares about graphics then this game might not be good for you , but if your a person going for storyline,and hard puzles then you'll love this it has a great storyline, and some pretty hard puzles to figure out. One of my favorite characters is Hanpan the wind mouse, he's fast and Jack Van Burace best friend. Jack is one of the main characters he is a treasure hunter(thief also). Rudy is 15 year old, dream chaser he handle the deadly arms and isn't what he seems.Cecilia is princess that is practicing magic, she has a secert weapon and doesn't even know about it. I think this game is great I would give it a 5, but i care a little bit about the graphics. Go get it gamers!"
4,wild arms,"This is a very good rpg.Some of the puzzles are difficult.For a one disc game it is very long,it took me 50 hours.But it was well worth it."
4,Wild Arms,"A fine little game. Much better than the over hyped Final Fantasy stuff - Terrific fun, great puzzles. If more titles thought about the gameplay and less about the graphics life would be better."
3,wild arms review,this is a very fun game. i love the story line. the music is awesome. the graphics are not bad. all in all not a bad game.
5,A Classic,"This is the definitive work on lost treasure in Oklahoma. The author gives an excellent survey of most of the lost treasures in the state which are commonly known (and some which are not so well known). The author seems to have researched the treasures in the western half of the state, particularly those in the Lawton area, more heavily than the treasures in the eastern half of the state. Nonetheless, on all of the treasures surveyed, there is sufficient information in the bibliography for the serious student to start researching any of the treasures."
5,Money well spent,A book for treasure hunting in Oklahoma is long over-due (even though this was done several years ago). Precise information along with very well done maps and easy to follow stories. There is no other book like this nor can any other book compare with it's information. Money well spent for this interesting Oklahoma book is a treasure hunters dream come true. A must read book.
2,"Good song, OK CD","Austin is a great song - boy does he have a fantastic voice - what range he has! But, I didn't fall in the love with the whole disk. It's not bad, but there aren't too many favorites on there. It's going to be one of the many CD's that I have that I pull out just to hear the one song that I love."
3,Disapointed!,I was very disapointed with this cd. I bought it for the song austin and was hoping for more good songs. The rest of the cd was not good. If you like the song austin I suggest getting the single. Don't waist your money.
1,"The only good song is ""Austin""","I can see why ""Austin"" was released first -it's the only good song on the whole CD. I'm very disappointed with this purchase!"
4,It's all about Austin,"I first heard Blake Shelton's song Austin one late night when I was listening to the radio. I wasn't really paying attention, until I heard the memorable intro, and Blake's incredible voice. As I tuned in to the words, I sat stunned at the intensity of the song. It went straight to my heart. The line at the end of the first chorus -'And P.S., if this is Austin... I still love you'- blew me away. I loved the song at first hearing, and sat glued to the radio for the next week, hoping to hear it. Finally, I gave in and bought the cd. I didn't really care about the other songs - I just wanted to hear Austin!! But, as it turned out, I enjoy the WHOLE cd. Several of the songs are refreshingly different. They have orignal endings, and are a welcome break from country's sometimes monotonous themes. And they're ALL catchy and fun to sing along with! I can't wait for Blake's next album."
4,Strange goings on in Academia-land,"The Univeristy of Illouria hired Rob Venestra for his geological expertise to develop a new program. Several professors then try to oust his department head. Rob and others support the head with whom Rob has developed great rapport. Then the head professor turns on Rob and asks him to leave. Rob refuses.This is an interesting viewpoint about the politics and diversity of university life, probably indicative of colleges and universities across the land.George Klein is a geological consultant who lives in Houston. George's first novel is based on a ringside seat at many intra-departmental fights among university professors scrambling to keep their research and teaching programs going with limited resources."
4,A Caveat,"Astonishing as it may be to hear ""performances"" by famous pianists and composers on the reproducing pianos, it must be kept in mind that the ""expression"" (i.e. dynamics) were all added later, that is, after the pianist recorded the roll, to a special ""coding"" channel on the margins of the piano roll. We have no way of knowing whether this was done by the original player or by a piano roll editor. So these recordings may represent the original pianist's intentions in the area of tempo and timing, but not necessarily as regards dynamics.[Edit 9/2011: I was mistaken about this. As opposed to the Duo Art/Ampico reproducing systems, the Welte-Mignon players WERE able to reproduce the original performers' dynamics and expression. Thanks to Daryl (see comments, below) for setting me straight.]"
3,NOT A CHALLENGE BUT ITS OKAY,"I played this one recently during a visit to my sister in Ft. Lauderdale. The game may not be a challenge to expert gamers but it was fun and different. Do not expect a traditional bowling alley here, it is completely different and more like a racing game. The graphics are OKAY and sure it will be a collector's item to any Flintstones Fan. My only regret is related to the fact that the game has already been released to video stores for rent and don't know the reason why it was not released for commercial retail yet."
3,soft alarm,"I like this watch, it has been very durable, but it is difficult to see at night, not very luminous, and the alarm is very soft, too soft to wake me up. This was a big disappointment, because I wanted an analog watch with an alarm. Timex used to make one, but now it seems all the watch alarms are for men."
4,Great biography on one of America's greatest scientists,"Great biography about James Conant because it covers a lot. It's great for what it's presenting to the reader. However, I have one complaint about it. The book (obviously) focuses on nuclear weaponry and the Cold War. Not only was he a scientist involved in the atomic bomb, but he was an IMPORTANT American educator from Harvard, too.He contributed much to American education and the book doesn't give enough coverage about his influence in education. This is not the book to read even if you want to get information on his issues with education. His autobiography ""My Several Lives"" is excellent because in that book he gives a balance to all of his contributions to American (and world) society."
3,Good buy,For the price this is a good product. However the user manual needs to be a little more detailed.
1,wow it worked for 2 weeks,do not buy this item. i brought 2 and they both failed within 2 weeks. you get what you pay for.
3,I guess you get what you pay for -- of course could have paid a lot more,"I bought one of these about 6 months ago and I used it a lot, especially when jogging. Today it quit working correctly. When I try to turn it on it powers up and then shuts off automatically. Tried changing the battery; didn't help. I paid about $40 for it so it cost me between $6 and $7 a month during its useful life. Was it worth it. Well, I enjoyed exercising a lot more. In all fairness, and based on other reviews of similar products, I guess I could have paid a lot more for something else and maybe not had much better luck."
3,"Item okay, but I'm no techno wiz...","The item is okay for the purpose I intend to use it. I've downloaded about 3 1/2 hours worth of music that I listen to on my pc at work, or when I exercise. I have not used the voice recording function except to make sure it works, which I plan to use in classes. Downside is that it does seem to ""lock up"" a lot, and I have to remove the battery to shut it down in order to start over."
2,"Good idea, doesn't quite come through","This flash drive seemed like a great idea. Unfortunatly, the player has trouble playing most of the music files I transfer to it from my iBook. The company says its compatible with Apple computers, but normally the player will only play a handful of the songs I transfer to it!"
4,great for beginers,"i liked it because it was my first mp3 player and it's easy to control, my friend brought over her video ipod and i could even make my way around it. nowhere near the experience though, but like i said great for beginers"
1,"Horrible, horrible product AND customer service.","I had this item for about a month before it started screwing up -- the mp3 player wasn't working right -- some songs that are definitely mp3 format won't play, and all the menus are messed up -- the text on the menus is totally gone, so a blind guess is all you've got if you want to change any format/playback options! spend more money and get something more dependable! Coby charges $6 for replacement and apparently doesn't give refunds (all I could get from customer service was generic emails), making it not-worth-the-trouble-or-money to send back. THEN, after another 4 months, the product won't even work as a USB drive to store anything. This is an AWFUL product, and the company is impossible to deal with."
3,MP3 Player,Player was easy to use. But I only used it 4 times and the menu button broke. I had to return it for a refund.
1,Do not purchase,"I bought one and it shut off at random times. I returned it (Amazon is amazing with returns) and had it replaced. This time it didn't get past the intro screen. It froze every time it was turned on.For one to be defective is disappointing, but for two to be defective indicates that the product is faulty in general."
3,Nice but a little gaudy for me,I love the style of the necklace but my only complaint is that the CZ's are too big and it is obvious that they are fake. Sort of gives it an obvious costume jewelry look. I have other necklaces by Peora that I love. The Garnet necklace from Peora without the CZ's is one of my favorites and I would recommend that one.
1,Spiderman Clock Review,"So, my son was starting kindergarten this year, and I thought that he would love to have his own alarm clock so that he could feel big like his older brother. Well, I purchased this clock after looking at many others. This was the one he wanted. We got it in the mail and he was so excited. We set it up by his bed and gave it a test try. Well, it didn't work. So, I put new batteries in, and it still didn't work. Needless to say, it still doesn't work. The clock will not keep time. So I don't suggest this if you want an actual alarm clock. Otherwise, my son likes the spiderman song it plays. That's about all it's good for."
1,Don't buy this!!,"If only I could give this negative stars - The thing is non-functional straight out of the box. Bought it for my boy to use for alarm clock for him to start Kindergarten. The thing did not keep time and was at a dead stop within about one hour. It was still ticking, but it was not telling time. Worst purchase ever on Amazon, or anywhere for that matter. I should have listened to the other reviewers."
4,A few reasons why I passed on this CD.,"This is a nice collection of hits, but there's a few things I didn't like about it. You see--Trust, Dirty Mind, Thunder, Pop Life, Sexy M.F., Nothing Compares 2 U, Batdance, If I Was Your Girlfriend, 7, P Control, Partyman, Controversy, Head, and a slew of others are missing. Now, if this is the very best of Prince, how come some real gems like these are out, while a song as lame as Money Don't Matter 2 Night makes the cut? I'm only a casual Prince fan myself, but even I recognize where a double CD would be needed to cover a twenty-plus year epic career."
1,I agree with the other reviewers,"Get the ""Hits/B sides"" collection...its a much better collection of his music, instead of the same ol plain jane stuff they overplayed on the radio. Looks like its just another way a record company to make a quick buck off of a musical genius. (Especially since he's not getting ANY money for it....what a ripoff!)"
2,For the causal Prince fan,"Hardly a 'best of' collection and more like a collection of most of the chart topping hits. Prince has too many great songs to try and squish them all on a single CD, which is why the 3 disc The Hits/The B Sides was released. But for the casual fan who's only interested in the radio hits, this should be a good disc to get. Hits like 'Batdance' and 'The Most Beautiful Girl in the World' aren't included, but if you're a casual fan it probably doesn't mean that much to you anyway. It's just too bad that with this collection you'll miss out one some other gems you might not be familiar with. At least the smooth and jazzy, yet (very) minor hit, 'Money Don't Matter Tonight' is included."
2,Misleading Title,"Prince could not have been consulted on this album as if he had been there would be a very different song list. Do yourself a favor if you are considering buying this album, buy The Hits and the B-Sides, a 3CD set which is much closer to ""Best Of"" than this thrown together group of songs. Actually, if you really want the Best Of Prince, buy his albums. Many of his best songs are those you have not ever heard."
1,Why isn't 0 an option?,"Could Warner's be more greedy? Is it possible? What a shoddy, grossly incomplete collection.Folks, please, pick up ""The Hits/B-sides"" immediately!"
1,What a JOKE,"Many of the other reviews sum up my feelings. Skimpy selection. Ignores many big hits. Ignore great album tracks. Adds absolutely nothing new, not a single song or even alternate mix. The Hits/The B-Sides, although more expensive, is the much, much better choice. AVOID THIS COMPILATION LIKE THE PLAGUE."
2,SOME of the BEST (at best....),"Submitted for your perusal, a list of songs NOT included on this ""VERY BEST"" compilation: ""CONTROVERSY,"" ""DIRTY MIND,"" ""I FEEL 4 U,"" ""WHEN U WERE MINE,"" ""SOFT AND WET,"" ""DELIRIOUS,"" ""TAKE ME WITH U,"" ""POP LIFE,"" ""MOUNTAINS,"" ""IF I WAS YOUR LOVER,"" ""BATDANCE,"" ""7,"" ""THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD."" Fortunately, one can opt for ""THE HITS/B-SIDES"" (1993). Maybe this was released as a mere refresher course. But one cannot properly honor Prince's nearly-25-year carreer without AT LEAST issuing a double-disc. This should have been titled, ""PRINCE -- A SAMPLER."""
2,Leave this one alone.,"As fan of Prince I was not excited about this hits copilation. First of all this would not be a greatest hits album in the first place especially one CD covering 2 decades of countless hits. Many of the songs on here were,nt even hits. I have never even heard of Alphabet St. and another big flaw to this album is that it did not include material from the post-Diamonds and Pearls material. This album is good but this should only be for the completists. This ones worth passing up. Go and get his 3 CD Hits and B-Sides collection instead even if it means shelling out over 50 dollars. At least we have Rainbow Children to look forward to."
5,The Very Best of Prince is th very best!,"Love this CD,it has all the songs I relly like by Prince. Recommend it highly if you are a Prince fan."
5,Great Prince CD,"Hello All,Let's start out by saying that this is a fantastic cd by Prince! It has all of your favorites on there such as: Little Red Corvette, Purple Rain, U Got the Look, Kiss, 1999, I Wanna Be Your Lover..... I can keep going on because this disc is filled with 17 songs of pure, raw edginess by our man! Go grab this CD, matter of fact, grab 2 while your at it:-)"
1,It's missing so many of prince's good songs,Not worth the purchase. Search out your favorite prince songs and download them individually. This album is not worth the purchase.
1,A Warner Brothers Distribution,I would not buy this simply because it is a product of Warner Bros and Prince will not see a penny of sales income
1,RIP-OFF,This is not even close to a good representation of Prince's best and was release without his approval.
4,it rocks!,Great old school Prince...all of the best with very few that you haven't heard. This is a great blast from the past!!!
1,Perposterous.,Squeezing Prince's best onto a single disc is like trying to cram the sun into your car trunk.
2,I'm gonna have to rant,"It kinda sickens me that too many people go on & on about silliness like Get Off,Sexy M.F.,etc.The same man who did complex works like Parade or Sign O The Times not to mention the stunning Graffiti Bridge tracks -The Question Of U & Joy In Repetition, should not have been doing juvenile, hiphoppity stuff like Get Off in the first place.This is NOT the very best of Prince."
3,There are better collections,"I prefer the two-CD collection ""The Hits 1"" and ""The Hits 2"" to this one. They offer a better group of great hits."
5,An Essential,Very pleased with the selections included. Sound quality was great. Maybe someday I will be able to àfford the complete anthology. Until then this gets me through a treadmill session.
4,Great CD,This cd has a good selection of Prince great hits. I have really enjoyed this cd and would recommend any Prince fan to buy it.
1,Don't waste your money if you're a true fan of Prince,"This compilation cd of hits is despicable. It's not even half the hits that he put out. Me, myself, I was born at during the time of Purple Rain circa 1983. My mom was a fan and listening to Prince while cleaning the house, I myself became a fan. So if you really want to rock out, get dirty and sexy then you need to not buy this one. BUY the Hits 1 and 2 and B-sides. Those are well worth the money."

1,Lets Forget This,"80""s Crap.Prince sings hits for the light in the loafers crowd. Deep six this for a Beatles album or some Zappa if you dare."
1,An insult to Prince and his fans.,"Call this one ""Prince: The Hits (The Cliffs Notes Version)."" And it's a lousy version at that: how can you do ANY collection of Prince and completely ignore the ""Dirty Mind"" album? No ""Controversy?"" Listen up: if you want to get a REAL Prince greatest-hits set, then save up your money and get the 3-disc ""The Hits/The B-Sides"" which is way better. Prince is way too prolific an artist to have his entire career crammed onto one disc. Everybody involved in the making of this CD should be ashamed of themselves."
5,For All The Little Prince Fans,"If your not a big Prince fan and only like his mainstream hits, then this is for you. All his biggest hits are here like ''1999'', ''Kiss'', and ''Purple Rain''. All of the songs are on point and if your a fan (big or small) you will enjoy this.My Faves1. Little Red Corvette2. Raspberry Beret3. Gett Off4. CreamPrince is the greatest artist living and I've seen him four times in concert. Real music is alive."
3,"Good collection, but...","...instead of making a half-baked compilation when there was already a worthy one (The Hits 1/The Hits 2/The Hits, The B-Sides) - and in spite of the fact that Prince split from Warner Bros. acrimoniously - why doesn't Warner Bros. re-release all of his classic albums (digitally re-mastered, of course)? There is a ton of great music that is unjustly getting ignored."
1,To keep this short and blunt....,"...in all honesty, you'd be waaaaayyyyy better off in just randomly picking a Prince studio album instead of buying this .... The album is a very scattershot and brief collection of 17 of Prince's hits, and while this may get a casual fan excited, keep mind that there are already two separate ""Hits"" discs that have much more to offer than this on their own ...so I wouldn't recommend this unless you are truly a casual fan and nothing more."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money on THE VERY BEST OF PRINCE, its just a cash cow for Warner who wanted to milk more money from Prince. If you want a comprehensive Prince collection, get 1993's THE HITS/THE BSIDES (3 cd set), but if you don't want to shell out that much money, buy the separate discs THE HITS 1 or THE HITS 2 (or both). All of the songs that are on here (except Money Don't Matter 2Night) are on those cds, so you're just buying the same cd really if you buy this one. You can find a much better collection than this one."
3,DECENT PRINCE STARTER SET,"Think of this cd as Prince with training wheels. While not a complete history of Prince's career as the Hits/B-Sides collection, it serves as a decent starting point for anyone interested in an overview of his music. I know this release has many Prince fans in an uproar since they feel it is just another way that Warner Bros. is getting over on him, but this release is not intended for hardcore fans who already own his entire collection but for those who may be interested in experiencing him for the first time, and this cd serves it's purpose, though not without fault. This is hardly a best of Prince collection considering the absence of such essentials as Dirty Mind, Sexy MF and I Could Never take the Place of Your Man."
1,I don't own this album...,"Why? Prince's music is something that needs to be accumulated, and listened to over time. A quick dose of his hits in no way will satisfy any music-loving soul. This album, besides being released by WB without any Prince involvement whatsoever, was also a slap in the face in that there is ALREADY a greatest hits album out there! With not one, not two, but three volumes to it! If you want a greatest hits collection, The Hits 1, 2, and 3 are paramount. And not only that, but the liner notes to The Hits are actually worth reading!Basically this was just a thrown off by WB to make money off Prince and its release strategically coincided with Prince's Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic release in 1999. And I am NOT one of those fans who blames WB for every bad thing that has happened to Prince in the last decade.This is fast food. Spend the extra money and get the gourmet Prince!"
1,For the Real fans of Prince,"For all of those who are considering buying this compilation of songs that were thrown together without really considering the best songs is just a waste of money. I have been a fan since 1980 and I must admit that Prince is just a brilliant musical genius and for Wasrner Bros. to put this cd out for his fans was a true smack in the face to us. No.1, if you love Prince like I do then you will understand that alot of his songs weren't hits, 2.Some of the best ones weren't hits and wasn't put on the cd.3. Prince has too many songs to just put on 1 cd. Grant it I own hits/b-sides 3 cd set, but some of those songs were cut short like ""Do me baby"", ""Adore"", and ""1999"". If a compilation cd needs to be put out and should it say, The very Best of Prince, let his fans be the ones to gather the right songs and put it together because it will be the best darn cd anyone has ever put out as a greatest hits album. Prince will always shine no matter what."
3,"Great music, but an unncessary CD","Why?? With the phenomenal ""The Hits/The B-Sides"" set from 1993, you would think Warner Bros. could have thought of something better than this as a Hits album. No, there haven't been many ""hits"" since that time, and certainly fewer that WB have the rights to release, but there are a few that are conspicuously missing from this album - where is ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World""? Where is ""I Hate U""?Obviously the songs on this album are fantastic, but they barely scratch the surface of Prince's career. If you want my recommendation, either A) Go out and buy The Hits/The B-Sides or B) Save the money and slowly buy each of Prince's albums. Forget the hits. There are too many overlooked gems from Prince's career - everything on The Gold Experience and Sign O The Times eclipse most of Prince's hits.Just my thoughts, of course...."
2,Why?,"I'll start by saying I am a huge Prince fan and supporter. This is a ""collection"" of his hits. Um well Prince has a lot of hits, so how can they just have it on one cd? One answer: they cant. This is to me, a waste of time. You can get all these songs (except Money Don't Matter 2Night) on either THE HITS/THE BSIDES or on THE HITS 1 and THE HITS 2 (on HITS 1 and HITS 2 not all these hits are on each, but on both cds). This is so disapointing, especially for long time fans. If you are a long time fan the only reason I could see to want this is collectors or something, because fans have most of his albums and it's just a better deal to get THE HITS 1 and THE HITS 2 or THE HITS/THE BSIDES. Don't waste your money on this (unless you want to) just get the cds listed above, for a more complete Prince greatest hits collection."
3,Black & White,"When he's good he's really, really good; but when he's bad he's boring as all get out.There was a time--it's hard to recall now, but I swear this is true--there was a time when Prince was on a plane with Michael Jackson and Madonna, artistically, creatively, and commercially. But at some point, somewhere around the time he went through all that silliness about using a self-created rune in place of the name moniker which he'd already used to replace his given name, the commercial bottom dropped out. His creative fires have cooled a bit in recent years too, though I would argue that he's a better musician and more of an artist than Madonna has been or MJ could even dream of being.I would also argue that this is NOT a ""Best of"" package, as it claims to be, but a ""Greatest Hits"" package. There is a difference."
1,funky prince fanatics won't bother on it!,"sure, i'm a prince fanatic, and i feel like i got some responsibilities 2 remind u who's interested in prince just recently that this collection is not the wise pick 4 u guys, go get all prince albums 2 really know what's really going on in the genius mind of prince, go get his first 4 albums, pick""COME"",""gold xperience""etc,..anything but this""very best of prince""...if u still lookin 4 his""best""compilation...3 cd set of the hits 1-2 and b sides will do much better than this, and 4 those of u ,prince fanatics, i believe that u won't bother 4 this one."
2,Older music is better,Nothing from 'Dirty Mind' or 'Controversy'? That's supposed to be a selling point?
4,Incomplete,"Though a more apt title for this album would have probably been""BIGGEST HITS"", THE VERY BEST OF nonetheless is a solid single disc compilation for those who don't feel the need to search out Prince beyond his radio singles. That said, all the big ones are here, from the grossly overplayed('When Doves Cry'), overrated('..Doves'again,'Purple Rain'), and the should have been completely ignored(the god-awful 'Thieves In The Temple' and the equally not good 'Raspberry Beret'). Among the missing in action, both 'The Most Beautiful Girl In The World' and '7' should have be included. Overall, a decent, if slightly incomplete, look at one of the most influential artists of the eighties and nineties, though those wanting a more complete overview would be better served by the two disc HITS collection."
3,A juke-box's view of Prince.,"Great tunes, but if you want the complete story, check out his website - NPGMusicClub.com. His new album, ""The Rainbow Children"", is on the way! And I haven't bought Invisible Mist's new album yet. So, gotta make a run to the store. Anyone want anything? Milk, eggs, tofu? Bye!"
2,Many of HIS BEST he never released...,"so do yourself a favor and look around on the net for his boots. I really like to collect ""outtakes"", his work that never made it onto the shelves as official releases; many of which are almost mainstream jazz in nature but perhaps not very commercially viable compared to his pop and funk work. Especially his live mixes can be very compelling; sometimes much better than the studio tracks. Many alternate takes and mixes are also available if you make some serious effort to look around.1 clue: Get BlueYogi"
2,problems with swimming,"i went in a four feet deep pool ans as soon as i got out the window of the watch was all steamed up so i send it back to the company and i am still waiting for it after three weeks ,,"
1,DOA,"After reading all I could, I settled on this beautiful little baby. I was so excited when it arrived. I plugged it in, let it charge overnight, but it would never turn on, just went to auto power off. So, I just packed it up, and it is going back. I am very dissapointed. This is the perfect Idea, too bad it didn't work. I am still optimistic however, so I will be exchanging it. Hopefully the next one will work! I'll revise me review if it does."
1,Could Not Get it to Work,"I have nothing good to say about this product. It wouldn't charge correctly, it was not visible by the USB and the documentation had no roots in reality. The technical support was non-existent. I'm a technical person and I lost hours on this before I returned it."
2,Great...till it stops working,"I had this for about 18 months. I was pretty happy with it, other than the annoying buzzing while it charged. The battery lasted for pretty long periods of time, it could hold a large amount of music, the sound quality was fine. But then all of a sudden I couldn't upload anything into it. I'm pretty good with computers so I tried to fix it, reinstall the software, anything I could think of. No luck, archos doesn't even support it anymore so I couldn't even read any FAQ info on it. Now I can't even use it as hard drive space. It's great while it lasts, but I wouldn't buy it without a warranty, maybe from best buy or something."
1,a pile of ****,"ive had it for about a year and in the beggingin it ran great. now i cant even connect it to my pc. i have win 2k pro and win xp pro. as soon as i connect it, i get the bsod. ive never gotten the bsod b4 while runing xp or 2k. get a ipod, it costs more, but u get better quality and faster transfer speeds. in conclusion stay far away from archos products!!"
4,A great MP3 Player,"It is everything you would want in a hard-drive based MP3 player, I would have giving it 5 stars, but the menus are hard to use"
2,DON'T REVIEW till you've had it a while ..,".. you may have to revise your opinion.Great while it worked (3 months). Liked the simple file drag-n-drop, ability to store data files, and compact size.After a while it would not start up even after recharging the batteries as usual.Swopped with the spare set of batteries and it worked again. After another few weeks, switching it on would cause the screen to light up briefly, then die.Never got it to work again.Still looking for a replacement. Any recommendations for a similar but RELIABLE jukebox?"
1,"Good Idea, Bad Execution!","It is a great idea, but the quality is poor. I am returning the unit because it seems to have many bugs. The technical support and customer service is non-existant, they don't return phone calls or e-mails. The instruction manual is useless, I probably would have returned it for this reason alone even if the unit worked. It takes a good amount of computer knowledge to get it up and running and then downloading songs. There are other high capacity players available now that are much better than this unit."
3,good...but not that good,"Bought my archos 2yrs ago. Astonished by the amount of available space. Ended up converting and downloading most of my music colection into it. Used it evry day. It finally died a couple of weeks ago first due to battery connections stopping the re-charge, then catastrophic failure of the control buttons. Very Sad, much missed. ow looking for a replacement."
4,An excellent MP3 player,"The Archos Jukebox 6000 is one of the best MP3 players available. The price on Amazon.com is better than the price of almost any other player capable of hold Gigabytes of data. The Jukebox 6000 can hold up to 6 GB of data, which translates to about 1500 songs. The batter pack lasts closer to 10 hours than the 8 hours advertised. The battery recharge is very useful as it's kind of difficult to get the cover over the batteries off. It's a little heavy, so you can't really take it running. However, the size is not a problem so you don't have to worry about portability. I have not experienced any major problems with the instructions or the unit itself. And contrary to popular belief, you can make playlists. The Jukebox 6000 is an excellent unit and worthy of your purchase."
3,Technical Difficulties,We loved our MP3 player until we were charging it one day and the thing started smoking. It began melting from inside. Anyone else have this problem?
2,Things to consider when buying the Jukebox!!,"The main problem that I encountered in the product as soon as I bought it was a faulty hard disk drive. After trying to contact Archos for customer support, all I was able to receive was an e-mail repeating the same troubleshooting tips that were on the product booklet. After finally exchanging it for another of its kind, and getting it to work, I must say that sound quality was not that impressive. Sure, the Jukebox is a neat storage toy: About 6 gigabytes and [a price tag] worth of 90 day warranty technology that I finally returned 3 days later. If you are just blowing off your cash go for it! Its just another fragile tech toy. Otherwise you might find yourself a better product. In my case, I got myself the new Net MiniDisc Player/Recorder from Sony. I still have to burn, but at least its cheaper, its compact, it contains a longer warranty and I can exercise without worrying about crashing the hardrive."
4,6gig or 64mb (bigmac or tic tac),Great product now it comes with a $... mail-in-rebate this is one of the best mp3 players out there. Only problem I've found is the batteries die to quick but you get two sets of rechargeable batteries. Better then those 64mb you get 6gigs are you crazy buy this now ...
3,"Great design, poor support, cheap hard drive","The looks of this device is pleasing to the eye, but one shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I've had problems from day one. Installation, connectivity and more. To put this long story short, the hard drive on these babies almost always has problems. A drawback is that the Archos 800 number tech support is disconnected! What's bothersome is that they never respond to emails. I guess they're going out of business soon. I would not recommend this device no matter how tempting. Creative has a Nomad Jukebox, I would go for that.I give this device a 2.5 stars (which rounds up to 3)"
4,Very User Friendly,"I don't know why the ""computer tech"" from Intel couldn't figure this thing out. It's really quite simple. Perhaps he had a problem with it because Intel has their own (goofy) MP3 player - hmm? ;-) I set up several folders, each with dozens of songs and it was a breeze. I also use mine for moving large files from my laptop to other computers. Awesome product and very versitile!"
1,"ARCHOS JUNK BOX,KEEP THE RECEIPT YOU WILL NEED IT.","I HAVE HAD 2 PLAYERS,THEY BOTH WENT BACK.NEXT I BOUGHT THE RECORDER,AT THE SANE TIME I BOUGHT MY LITTLE GIRL,THE NOMAD JUKEBOX,SHE IS ONLY 10 YEARS OLD. SHE WAS HAVING ALL THE FUN,I WAS HAVING ALL THE PROBLEMS.THE ARCHOS IS JUNKKKKKK.SO HAVE ALL THE FUN,BUY THE NOMAD JUKEBOX."
2,KEEP YOUR RECIEPT,"I got this thing because I have a lot of music and I don't like every song on a cd. This thing is great when it works, which most of the time it does not. The reason I said keep the receipt was because of TONS of errors that it has. you have to format and run scan disk (the through one). You also have to run disk defragmenter all of which are very time consuming. Don't waist your time trying e-mail or call Archos because it's not worth it. Most of the time they don't return your e-mails and you have to wait about 2 hrs. to talk to a tech who really know what they're talking about. I'm returning mine and buying a Nomad Jukebox. It holds the same amount and costs a little less than what I paid for this piece of junk."
4,Great Product But the worst Tech Support in the industry,"I have the player/recorder and love it when it works. I has some bugs but since I bought it the first day of availability I expect some bugs. What I did not expect is non-existant tech support. Their product support page is blank, they do not respond to emails ,PERIOD, sent to the tech support address. Right now the product is worthless as it will not go back in the directory tree structure...it's stuck in a subdirectory."
5,Owned for 6 weeks and still loving it.,"The device has had a couple of bugs in the firmware, but Archos has been working on it. They've had two releases of the firmware since I ordered mine. Makes me feel confident that they are working to make the product better.The headphones they provide are crap, but with an average quality pair, it sounds great. I've been able to get 8+ hours of life consistently out of mine.I have over 1000 MP3s and haven't filled 1.5 gig yet. Having your entire collection in the palm of your hand is awesome.I'd buy this device again over the Nomad."
1,"If Archos' Tech support reads this, tell them to call me","After 3 days of waiting for Archos Technical Support to call me back (Three voice-mail messages, two e-mails) I decided to send my little malfunctioning unit back to Amazon. The 6GB drive is why I bought this. Amazing price for 6GB, but the thing shuts itself off every three seconds, regardless of how long it's charged. After 24 hours of charging, you'd think it would stay on for an entire song. I gave up waiting - maybe you'll have more luck. Don't be fooled by the one star review - there is no ""No Stars"""
5,Great Product...,"I have had my jukebox for about a month now and I can't begin to say how great it is. I guess for me it is especially useful because I use it often as a USB hard drive. I installed it on both my Windows ME system and my sisters Mac G3 in less than 5 minutes. Make sure you download the latest firmware (4.53g) and a lot of the bugs discussed in previous reviews are gone. My only complaint is the headphones, they are awful. However, I also think this is where a lot of the complaints of sound quality come from, I use my JB with an Airhead Amplifier from Headroom and the Sennheiser HD580 headphones and the JB sounds wonderful..."
4,Great Little Toy,Positives Great size and sound. The USB works great and I had no problems loading about 4GB of music on it.Negatives The headphones broke in half after 3 days. Firmware got toasted and I have to send it back for exchange. (hopefully the new one will have the new firmware)All in all I am glad I bought it. Even with having to send this one back. It is still a great little sound machine.
2,"Nice, but flaky","Many things about the Archos Jukebox are terrific. It's cheap, the USB hard drive approach makes it easy to load music on the thing, and the sheer concept of a hard drive based MP3 player is great. But the Archos units are flaky, and consumers should definitely look at other brands.The biggest problem is the Jukebox has a habit of randomly losing all its data, forcing the user to reformat the hard drive. This happens to a lot of people and it's unacceptable.Other problems: the buttons are cheaply made, playlist support is poor, playback randomly skips, etc. For more info, see the archives of the AJB6000 mailing list..Overall, I like my Archos MP3 player, but mostly because this product category is so great. I wish I'd bought some other brand that wasn't so flaky."
1,Macintosh users beware,"My recommendation is not to buy this product if you are going to use this on your mac. This product crashes the finder on both of my mac's (G4 &G3) and the MusicMatch software is worthless. To create music playlists you need to search the web for a third party piece of software that works OK but can only access one level, so you cannot organize you music into artist folders, you have one big folder with many (100's) MP3's. It gets messy I would buy a Ipod."
1,not the best mp3 player you can buy,"very usless and dangerous!!!!!! I got mine a month ago and first of all you cant even change the volume setting once you ajust it. Second the battery life is terrible and doesnt even last the one whole day. LAST I WAS RECHARGING IT OVER NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING THE MP3 PLAYERS MIDDLE BUTTON HAD COMPLETLY MELTED, JUST FROM RECHARGING IT!!!"
3,"Good, but...","This player has a lot going for it (see other reviews). However, you should be aware that there are a lot of other options, some clearly superior (albeit more expensive). Most notably, Archos has come out with a newer version of its 6 Gig jukebox, the ""player/recorder,"" which is widely regarded as being a *major* upgrade in terms of sound quality and functionality. Also, it's worth considering the NEO Jukebox, which has 20 Gigs of storage, better sound quality, superior LCD display, wireless remote, and which also doubles as a general purpose USB hard drive. Then there's the 20 Gig PJB by HanGo -- all are choices with superior features and sound quality (but for more $$). Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't currently appear to be selling any of these other units. (Hint, hint, Amazon!)"
1,Avoid like the plague,"I researched buying the product and was genuinely excited about buying it. When I got it, it looked great and hooked up easy enough to my computer. After i had loaded it up the problems started. The machine crashes day after day and now i use it as a door stopper. Dont try emailing for support, they won't reply.D'ont touch the product.....if you are unluckly like me, you will have wsted your money, and archos dont care.|Buy something else!"
1,[NO GOOD]...,"This is the most annoying ...[thing] i've encountered in all my days. FIRST: The batteries last for 2 1/2 hours AT MOST. Second: It is near IMPOSSIBLE to follow the installation instructions. Third: It freezes my computer EVERYTIME i try and put more songs on it. There are more reasons to list, but i am going to go and throw mine ...[out]."
5,Still runs like a champ....,"I've used my Jukebox 6000 almost everyday since June, and it's been everything i hoped it would be. I mostly use it in my car with the casette deck attachment, but I've been able to apply other practical uses for it. I can upload any of my favorite .mp3s to my friends' PCs/Macs. It serves as a walkman and storage for large files when I'm on the road. The Jukebox is not only limited to music file storage (which is the case with the bulky NOMAD). I've used it to store large mpegs, software installation files, and hard drive backups so I could avoid burning CDs, and lugging around my laptop on some business trips.With the latest BIOS updates, this puppy seems to run longer too... If you're trying to decide between the Nomad and the Jukebox...... Jukebox all the way! No Contest."
3,"Errors, Errors, Errors","Sounded good, if you buy better headphones. Separate volume button would have been great. Nice size. Sparse documentation. Too bad it didn't work. It would copy a few files, then the blue screen message, ""Unable to write to drive F:"". It would copy a another file, then the same error. Tried a different computer, and website recommended procedures to fix the problem... same results. It goes back to the store tomorrow."
2,I returned the piece of junk!,"Cheap construction .. the battery covers are flimsy, and I though I was going to break it trying to get the batter covers off. But that's not the worst of it, expect horrible battery Life: about 2 hours on a full charge! AND, you can ONLY use the batteries that they supply with it, even though they are DOUBLE AA size! The fact that it will not work with other double A batteries seems a horrible design flaw.I think it's only good as a repository for files or MP3's, but as a practical listening device it's not very good, in my opinion. Supplied headphones are cheap and don't sound good. It doesn't appear that it has an optional car hookup power supply, which renders it nearly useless to me (with the abysmal 2 hours battery life). Others rated it high, but I don't see it. On the plus side, it's easy to use (and transfer files, with USB interface) and can store any file, not just MP3's."
1,BEWARE!!!,"The thing looks nice. But after the initial 6 hour charge and I started to use it it proved that looks can be decieving. I got many PC freeze-ups and bluescreen errors trying to deal with the USB uplading but it eventually worked and I threw in about 250 tracks. But after only one day of only a few hours of listening The unit stopped working and displayed an error message upon startup. I couldn't even access the drive through the USB because it had somehow messed itself up so badly. The thing to keep in mind is that unlike other MP3 players, this unit is a Hard drive so it can have all the same glitches and quirks that a computer can have with a much more confusing interface then a computer. Wish me luck on my return process..."
3,"Will it Record From External Sources like Walkman, TV, mic","I am planing to buy a MP3 Recorder. My Purpose is not to listen to the 100's of songs. My Purpose is to record the Songs From Audio tapes to the JukeBox (By Taking the Walkman's Headphones Out and connecting to the line in of the Juke Box). Is it having the line-in facility so that i can record music from external sources like Walkman, TV, Musical Keyboards.Will it record with high quality when we use Line In ? All the walk mans will not have line out. Only will have sound out put. I want to connect sound output to the line-in. Will it record with high quality even the sound volume varies from the external sources.If this is going to be intelligent enough to record with high quality at all the input levels I Purchase this.But no review says about the external Recording. Please Prvide information on External Recording.(Analog(Walkman) to MP3 Digital(Juke Box))Thanks."
2,Prone to crashing,"This MP3 player would be great if it didn't keep crashing and losing all my music. I finally took mine back after the hard disk in it cratered and I lost all my music for the third time. Another guy who owned one told me he had the same problem. The other bad thing about it is that the controls are all digital, so you have to scroll through a menu to do things like adjust the volume or treble/bass levels.It does have lots of room, more than most, but that only counts if it does basic things like not lose all my songs."
2,Good luck with it.,"Nice idea but poor execution. When I could get it to work with the computer, it's actual performance was mediocre. Sound quality was poor. Lots of distortion at peak volume levels. Volume levels hardly enough to overcome local noise. This was my fastest product return ever. Save yourself some time. Look elsewhere."
1,Archos JUNKbox 6000,I'm now on my third JUNKbox 6000. The first one I got locked up on start up after only using it 2 times. I called Archos tech support and they couldn't figure out the problem and had me send it back for an exchange. JUNKbox #2 arrives I spend hours formatting it and transfering my MP3 files to it. I use it 1 time for 3 hours no problem. I go to turn it on the next day and guess what.....Lock up AGAIN!!!! I take the batteries out and put them back in....still locked. I go through this sequence about 6 times and finally it boots up and tells me to check hard drive....which I can't do because it dosen't let me go any further then that screen. I call tech support again and they say they'll send me another one for exchange. I'm now getting ready to go through the task of formatting and adding MP3 files to this JUNKbox. Aargh!!!!!
4,Great MP3 player,"Before I purchased the ARCHOS Jukebox 6000, I've purchased two other brands of MP3 players. None of the others provide easy MP3 playing: one gave choppy sound and the other doesn't play mp3 files at all! I decided to give Archose Jukebox 600 a try and I am glad that I did. It worked right out of the box, I was able to transfer mp3 files into the Juke box with drag and drop from Windows Explorer, the mp3 files are recognized without a glitch, the sound quality is great with the provided headphone. I'm impressed!The only issue I had was the slow charging of batteries. It takes several hours to charge the battery. You must charge the batteries fully before accessing the mp3 file list. This is the only incovenience I experienced.Overall, the Archos Jukebox 6000 is a great buy."
2,How about some quality control???,"I've had problems with the power coming on (Yes, I know to hold the button down, but it doesn't come on unless it's USB cord is plugged in).Even after properly allowing the batteries to fully charge and the like, every recharge takes hours upon hours. should i have to charge for 8 hours to get 8 hours of play? I don't think so.I have contacted customer support, but no response yet. All my problems seemed to happen after downloading a firmware upgrade.Though it may be subjective, I just dont have a good feeling about the player/company. If they fail to send an idea to fix it(it's been 3 weeks already), I'm returning it to Amazon. This was great at first, but the whole ""NOT WORKING"" thing kind of put a rain on my parade.Just spend a bit more and insure your happiness."
2,Look elsewhere first,"For the amount of money that you pay for this player, you get a lot of storage. That is the good part! If you want to easily find a song that is the bad part. You can not create your own music files, you have to use the few they provide. You can not create files under various music types (jazz, blues etc) if you do not use the list they provide, you have to scroll thru each song until you find the one you are looking for. They provide you with a case to carry the player in, but if you place it in the case, and attempt to walk, or jog with it, it will error with a hard disk error. You do have a equalizer,it is not as good as some of the others such as Intell's MP3 player. You can not get FM radio on this player. If you want to use this as a back up harddrive, it is no problem. If you want to use this as your mp3 player, I would shop around first."
1,Buyer beware,"My Archos Jukebox 6000 was defective right out of the box. When I contacted their customer service, the representative suggested I try standard batteries instead of rechargeable ones. When this didn't solve the problem I contacted them again. They then informed me they would repair the unit for ""a flat fee of $65.00""."
4,Great product... bad support,"Ok, I think this thing is awsome! The only problem I have had is when I tried installing the driver software. Everything went fine when it said that it couldn't find the 'USBNTMAP.SYS'. I think this only happens with Windows ME. If you can't find 'USBNTMAP.SYS' in the in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\, then try C:\WINDOWS\OPTIONS\CABS2\. Technical support didn't help me at all finding this location... they just told me to contact my computer manufacturer. The Product is awsome, but the tech support could use a little work!"
2,problems to be aware of,"I returned my archos jukebox for the following reasons:1. The power supply heated the player alarmingly; message boards have made it clear it would eventually destroy the device if not replaced.2. Bought and returned 2 non-functioning remote controls; the problem was not the batteries as has been reported.3. Skipped when attempting to run with it.4. Volume control is either a 2 handed or menu-embedded operation.None of these alone would have made me return it, but combined it was clear that this was not a well made device. In fairness I should point out I use my player mostly in the gym, and this is not the machine for that location. Best Buy gave me a full refund including the extended warranty. Bought a mpio-dmk instead and have been blown away with this very cool, tiny, simple, well made, fully functional player."
4,Few Quibbles,"The Archos is a fine unit. I've had mine for several months and have put it through some paces. I use it in my car with one of those (lame) cassette adapters, thus giving myself an instant automobile ""jukebox"".My primary quibble would be that the display -- which only displays about 12 characters per line for an album or song title, makes it a bit cumbersome to read.Also, I think the battery rating of 8 hours is probably over-optimistic, although this is just my sense from using the device, not from any quantitative testing.The fact that this device doubles as a general-purpose hard-drive makes it hard to beat for overall value. I was able to toss hundreds of hi-res digital camera photos and tons of Word documents and other business-related files, like my 500 MB Outlook file, onto the device when I lost my job and had to quickly remove all my personal stuff from my work laptop -- all that, and still room for 50 music CD's! That's hard to beat."
2,Provided little value for me,While I'm involved with CMM and SCM I thought the book had too much abstraction and not much meat. I didn't see much value nor takeaways to pass on to my colleagues.
5,Your dog willl love you for this!,This product keeps my dogs fur looking healthy and shinny. My dog doesn't have a dry skin problem but it's probably due to this product. Before I bought it I read a review of a lady who uses this on her own hair. I did the same and just one spray on the palms rubbed on the hair gives surprising results. It keeps your hair moist and smooth.
4,The Peru Expedition,"The Peru expedition is a great introduction to travel for those of us who because of empty pockets or an adventurous streak want to rough it a bit...Brady's descriptions are colorful and honest, his drawings quirky, and his bits of homespun advice are entertaining, if not informative: for instance, Brady suggests that if you are planning to hike in high altitudes, it's a very bad idea to get very drunk the night before. The Peru Expedition is a whole lot of fun and information packed into a very accessable, easy to read, comic book format...I enjoyed it very much."
4,Ballet Shoes,I purchased these because my feet often got wet going to work. I have never found galoshes that fit. Now I can change shoes when I get to work and be fashionable until my normal shoes dry.
5,Great for academic team practice,"I have a child who is now a high school academic team competitor in various areas, including quick recall. I was told by one of her academic team coaches that the cultural literacy quiz books were good for studying and practice material so I bought this paperback along with a hardcover edition. My child has used the cultural literacy books for the past few years and now, as a high school competitor, she is on the road traveling to various tournaments across this part of the US. While on the bus traveling to the tournaments, her coach makes the students study, and she always takes these books along in her backpack to use during study time. They've been a tremendous help to her and she said she's been able to answer some quick recall questions as a result of reading the answers in these books. Highly, highly recommend for this purpose."
3,Not Bad,"This is a decent gun for the price. There are better ones, but it's good for begginers. Careful with the ""silencer"" though. It can decrease accuracy."
2,POS,"This gun is awful, for the same price you can get FAR more accurate ones. All BBs dramatically veer to the left after just 10+ feet, I've tried several 6mm weights, but they all do the same with or without the silencer."
3,On the fence,"I wanted to save some money on Miele vacuum bags so I purchased these made for my model but not the Miele brand.So far, my experience has been 50% positive. That is because the very first bag I installed in the machine broke, spreading detritus around the inner area [luckily the filters were in place and dirt didn't get past them into the motor]. I am now on the second bag, so far so good. I am keeping my fingers crossed.If bags in the rest of my order hold together, I will give an 80% positive rating."
5,Very nice set,"I'm allergic to a wide variety of dusts, and this is a nice set of vacuum bags. Lots of bags. Nice filter too. Good value."
4,Quite easily the worst game i've played,"If you like to play the most irritating games possible, then you simply must pick this one up. You spend more time running from battles than you do actually fighting them, building up your characters takes forever, and the game is not balanced at all! You will consistently encounter enemies that are too tough for you to reasonably handle, and the game is just too time consuming (in a bad way) to be any fun! About the only good thing that I can say is that the graphics were pretty good. That's it."
1,Utterly awful,"Lots and LOTS of random battles, dumb characters, dumb gameplay, graphics that would look bad on the SNES (except for the constant battles). I played this when there were no other RPGs on the Playstation and I had the flu. With so many great RPGs out now, there is no reason for this game. Actually, there was no reason for it in the first place. I'm an RPG nut, but this one is just plain bad."
1,My opinion on this game.,"When I got this game I thought it would be really cool, but I was wrong. Here are things that are bad in this game. First of all the music isn't that great and it can get really annoying to listen to, especially the battle music. Second the battle system stinks because at the beginning of the game you start out with 11 hit points! In most other RPGs you start out with over 100. Also some items in the game are too expensive to buy because you don't get very much gold from battles. Basically this game is the worst RPG, so don't buy it."
3,Its Ok.,"This games is not as bad as everyone says it is. I will admit I have not played it all the way through, but I have played worse RPGs. The graphics are not great, and the storyline is a little dry and the characters dont really develop. Yes, this game lacks, but its not down right awful. Although with the release of the PS2 and all the new RPGs hitting the market, you can easily find a RPG that would be much more fun!"
4,This was the first RPG for Playstation.,"This game is as hard to find now as when it was first put on the store shelves. This game gave a good idea of what was to come in the future. If you have played any of the PS1 Final Fantasy games this game will not be too fun, but held those who bought it over till FF7. If you have it DO NOT SELL IT, a very rare game to have."
4,this is the first rpg game playstation came out with,i wish i never would of got rid of this game if i would of known that ps1 games were going to be really hard to get i would of kept it but i got i think the last dungeon in the game and i made it to the 7th floor and there was a d@mn trap and i ended up back on the first floortheres lots of brain busting puzzles but there all fun to play and u will figure it out eventually lol if u have the internet near by then it might be easier to find clues
2,"These leave lots of ""air bubbles""","I used these labels with a ""CD Stomper"" application tool and could not get ONE label on without air bubbles no matter how I tried. I won't buy these again unless someone posts an evaluation saying they used another application tool and it left NO AIR BUBBLES... they print OK, they just don't apply worth a hoot... If I can get them to work, I will update my ""stars""...."
3,9yrs old and still works,"I was curious if they still made these flashlights. I received one as a Christmas Gift from my daughter back in 2002. I don't use it very often, but, the thing still works great, well, as good as one of these things can work. It's not the latest LED blind the bad guy - bright, and it is not comparable to a Maglite, or Steamlight, or any of the other Mil/LE types lights, but, in a pinch it will get the job done. I have a large collection of flashlights of various types and sizes, thanks to a 21yr career as an Air Force cop. I wouldn't depend on this model if my life was at stake, but, any light is better than no light. Sounds like there may be some bad pirate copies floating around out there. Mine does not have any watch type flat looking batteries. None. So take that observation for what it is worth."
1,Worthless Crap!,"Do NOT buy Excalibur or ""Forever Flashlights"" unless you want to waste your money. I too was lured by the idea of saving money on batteries and lightbulbs. And I was also impressed by the ""Forever"" title, which gave me the impression of a life-long product. Well just within a year after buying one it no longer works the way it's supposed to. Shake it, push the button, and no light. But shake it while the button is in the on position and the light will flicker on and off like a strobe light! That was kinda fun for about 7 seconds. So, the capacitor stopped holding the charge. For those who don't know, a capicator is just a battery. Now it's a useless, ugly paperweight, soon to be landfill crap. This thing is made rugged though, so it should last about a million years in a landfill!! :("
1,Bait & Switch,"I specifically ordered the ""Excalibur Forever Flashlight"" from Instapark, because my research indicated that the no-name Chinese copycat versions of this flashlight were cheaply made garbage. I could have paid 1/2 the price from other vendors for the knock-offs, but I wanted a better quality product, so I paid more to Instapark. Well, when the 2 flashlights arrived, they were both the Chinese knock-offs; in fact, 1 of them was obviously previously opened and returned. I have called Instapark and am awaiting a return call, we will see if they make this right. However, if they do not have the product they advertise, they MUST advise you and allow you to cancel your order (not only because it is the right thing to do, but also to do otherwise is CONSUMER FRAUD in violation of federal law! Imagine paying for a new Porsche and receiving a Hyundai. This is no different."
1,a tornado swept through town,"Useless, if you have both arms broken like I did when a tornado swept through town. The Flashlight just sat next to me in the dark as I could do nothing with broken arms. I tried to shake it with my toes but it takes years of practice unless you were born with lobster feet."
1,The flashlight doesn't work!,"I got a Forever Flashlight as a gift and no matter how much I shake it, it doesn't light."
1,Forever ends in 2 years,"This weak worthless single led light actually is powered by 2 coin batteries which are very difficult to replace. When the batteries wear out, (can no longer recharge by shaking) this thing is totally worthless. I was able to replace them with 2 coin batteries, butI cannot recommend this repair to others, as it requires cutting out the wires holding in the circuit board, removing the screws holding in the board, cutting open the soldered on battery can,wrapping tape around the outside edge of the 2 replacement batteries, and soldering the whole mess back together. Note: the positive side of the new batteries must face toward the circuit board, which may look opposite of the original orientation of the original coin batteries."
1,Fradulent Product,We ordered based on the website photo and we got totally different product. I am not sure about the credibility of this organization
1,warning,"The case studies are entirely on people in the biotech sector. Good ideas, but not as useful for people outside of this field. Would have been more accurate to call the book ""Alternative Careers in Biotech."""
1,Leaky Bottle,"This perfume arrived promptly, but when I was wrapping it to give as a gift, I discovered the box was leaking. I have to return it now and am unsure as to how to do it. Fiasco!"
4,ERIKA'S REVIEW,I have this CD and I think it's awsome. The songs are deep and predict that this band will be HUGE.:)
1,Why?,"How about the worst name for a band in history? These guys will never make it, just in the marketing of their name. Who made that decision? I won't even listen to the album based on the name, it's so bad. Good luck getting your songs noticed, idiots!"
4,I have found it!,"I was sitting here one day and all of a sudden out of no where I remember that band pete. so I was like.....hey.....I think I have a song by them on an old cd. And sure enough! Pete. - Sweet Daze was there! these guys are a good sounding band, but the cds virtually impossible to find other than on amazon.com....I must get this cd now!"
1,Zion CrossOVER,Corey Harris used to be an innovative blues singer. On this release he sounds like countless monotonous reggae artists including altering his vocal style to accommodate this recording. Sadly its reggae pulp.
3,Grows on You,"Not the best effort from this band, which is one of my favorites, but it has a series of catchy tunes that grow on you.Songs 8 and 9 on the album are the kind that are good to lounge around to, that help inspire stream of consciousness type thinking.Songs 5 and 10 are kind of are the kind you would want to have in the background during a small get together, when you're friends are over playing cards and chewing the fat.Mostly, the songs are kind of silly. ""Words to live by"" and ""Rod Beck"" are the kind that make you raise one eyebrow and kind of think to yourself, ""what?""If you are new to stroke 9, you are better off purchasing one of their earlier albums, such as Nasty Little Thoughts or Bumper to Bumper.Also, do yourself a favor and delete track 2 from you playlist as soon as you download it. Its grating sound and annoying beats would have been better left on the floor of the recording studio."
4,Give it a Chance,"When I first bought this, I was like many of the other reviewers and thought it was pretty lame. However, upon repeated listenings, I have to say this is a pretty good record. Not as good as "" Nasty Little Thoughts"" or ""Rip It Off"" but still worth it for fans. While its obvious they were shooting to get some radio air play with a poppier sound there some pretty clever songs. I really enjoy ""Abandon Confusion"" & Faux Gucci Girl."" So give it a few listenings and enjoy!"
4,Just what i needed.,Pros:1. Arrived on time in great shape.Cons:1. It doesn't have many colors inside but it's for studying and you don't have many options anyway. But i would buy it again.
2,Entourage: on CD,"WARNING: REQUIRES ADOBE PHOTOSHOP 3.0.5 OR HIGHER TO VIEW AND USE IMAGES!I purchased this product with the expectation that the images would be available in some type of ""universal"" graphic file format. Unfortunately, all images are in ""EPS"" file format, requiring some type of software application, such as PhotoShop, to view and export. Graphic images appear to be good quality, but included thumbnail viewer (for viewing thumbnails only) is simple and outdated."
4,Flawed but true to feelings,"MY SISTER ANNIE is Charlie's story. Like many preteens, he's starting to be interested in girls, he wants to fit in with the boys, and then there's his family, which embarrasses him, particularly his sister Annie, who although older, doesn't act it, because she has Down Syndrome.Charlie's interactions with Annie and his struggle over his conflicting feelings for her, are true to life. While I can't give this book five stars because of the too predictable, too easy plot devices at the end, if you want to understand what it's like to have a Down Syndrome sibling in the family, this is the book."
1,I wasted my money.,"No fault to the product itself, but the only reason I purchased this insert was from a phone call that I made personally to Carbon Express who recommended this Insert #2 for my Carbon Express Devil's Wrath Arrow. After following the customer service recommendation on purchasing this insert to fit my arrow (directly from Carbon Express help desk), I received the product. The product came quickly and undamaged. However, the insert did NOT fit my arrow shaft, so now I have a package of worthless Inserts."
3,Sigma EF-500,The auto-zoom head automatically adjusts to lenses from 28mm wide-angle to 105mm telephoto and a built-in ultrawide-angle diffuser provides flash coverage for a 17mm lens. The height of the Sigma EF-500 helps to greatly reduce or eliminate red-eye and its flash head bounces and swivels for professional-looking portraits. The rechargeable batteries in this kit will enable your flash to get ready faster and save you money over using disposable alkaline batteries. but is not very fast about taking action sports
1,Don't buy this unless your favorite stations are strong ones,"You get what you pay for, it's cheap in price and extremely cheap in quality. It only recieves the strongest stations. In a building the reception goes almost all static unless your next to a window. I finally got rid of mine and bought a pricier pocket radio with better reception."
3,Average radio,"This is a small, lightweight radio. It's quite stylish, ""cute"" and available in eyecatching colours. It's definitely cheap. However, radio reception is poor, batteries are not included, the neck lanyard is annoying and construction is as cheap as the price. I cannot fault this product: it's a reasonable analogue radio. However, it is completely useless since it neither receives the channels I want to listen to, nor does it tune easily to other channels, nor does it hold those once it does. In short, I have to buy another radio with a digital tuner, perhaps one that prevents drift and certainly one with a better antenna."
2,"ok intro, but not for those encountering psychology for the first time","I found this book OK since I am familiar with the fundamentals of psychology. If you, however, are not familiar with the subject and are studying it for the first time, then I suggest that you buy a book that is both more pedagogical in terms of layout and examples provided and accessible in terms of writing style and explanations. The writing is dull and dry which unfortunately makes the subject boring."
4,A very short introduction,This book is too brief and lacking in depth to be useful for college psychology but for those who are just curious about psychology it hits the mark.
1,Brush Head not the Same as Original,This was a replacement for my original brush head. This replacement is not even remotely of the same build quality as the original. The power brush is under-powered and the plastic housing is cheap and flimsy. Apparently a bad knock-off...
4,"Yes, this IZone line of products seems to be marketed...","to the preteens of America. But I (an honest-to-goodness grownup) have yet to find a fellow adult who is not tickled pink by these tiny polaroids and the accessories -- like this ""splat"" frame -- that are sold with them.I have taken almost a hundred of these little pictures and have found that, unless I stick them onto something as soon as I take them, they tend to get lost around my house (my place isn't so very big, but these polaroids are so very small!) I bought several of these 'splat' frames which are ideal for keeping favourite snaps proudly displayed on the fridge. Children love to see pictures of themselves around the house, and this frame makes it easy to keep fun images in full view at all times."
2,Poor and tedious game.,"Thank heavens I bought this in a clearance sale. It did not keep my attention for long and for 2 reasons. First, it is a very easy game and very quickly finished and second, there just wasn't enough going on.The graphics were atmospheric and did create a cool mood similar to that of the movie but the sound was barely noticed. Slight music and sound effects kicked in once or twice each level and the voices were so obviously not Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.Puzzles are easily solved and there is practically no mystery. The gameplay is simply dull. Character control is shockingly dated and there isn't even much for them (you can play K,J or um...Linda Fiorentino)to do. All you basically do is walk around in a very limited environment where usually nothing fills the screen.Considering the scale and ambition of so many modern games this one seems extremely primitive in comparison. Definitely not worth attention for anyone over the age of 8."
4,"Cool, helpful, worth the read","One thing that's bugged me in my various efforts at writing a comic book script is that no reference I checked seemed to agree as to what format is right. As this book explains, that's because there IS no ""right"" or ""wrong"" format, just different ways to do it.Every script in this volume shows you something. Gaiman's reads like a personal note to the artist, Wolfman shows how plot-first can work, McDuffie shows you how to work in a recap, Kevin Smith shows a more movie-script style of writing and Kurt Busiek's entry... heck, when I read the original comic book I thought it was one of the greatest comic book stories I ever read, but the script for ""The Nearness of You"" just made it all the more powerful.If you want to try to write comics, you could do a lot worse than picking up this book."
4,It Is What It Says It Is,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: a collection of scripts by top comic book writers. As such, it is instructive: the scripts follow one another and it's fascinating to see how each creative mind works differently. And presents finished scripts differently! The book is definitely worth reading and studying, but I found myself wishing throughout that there had been more information, comments, instructions, and/or suggestions from the editor."
3,"Not a review, so much as a query & an invitation for a response....",... I'm curious... how many aspiring pencillers out there have picked up this book (or its' sequel) as a source of scripts from which to prepare sample portfolio page layouts?
2,Talk about uninspiring.....,"This is photography? The photos are just plain aweful. The photos are uninspiring. It's mostly grainy documentary photos of the Stuttegart ballet. The studio shots are boring, usually taken with one light source from above, and the poses are very typical and unoriginal. The worst are the blown up cropped shots that looks like images that an amateur photography would do.The book also has extremely poor layout, it seems it was trying to be creative with it. For example, you have many full page spread with just one word scaled up to fill the space. Then you have pages with one small photo that fills up about a fifth of the space.I was hoping to find compelling and dynamic or just plain interesting photos, but found none. You might want to wait until this goes in to the bargain bin before purchasing. I know this is a harsh review, but I was very dissappointed with how some people could publish snapshots and call it photography.I have returned this book to amazon."
4,Some Beautiful Pics,"In response to Mr. Ho's negative review, let me just say that he has very selective memory or perceptions. The book is full of big, beautiful pics. A few of the pics are small, but this is a minority of pics. The pics come in three basic types. About four fifths of the pics are either posed, of the dancers lounging around or just random pics of faces, arms and legs etc. The posed pics are very nice, but not dynamic. The pics of the dances just lounging are more for erotic purposes, I think. About a fifth of the pics are stop-action, and these are wonderful, and more than justify the price of the book. The poses tend to be drawn a bit more from modern dance than ballet, but as a ballet lover I still found them to be satisfying. Having three books of ballet photography with the dancers in costume, it was interesting to see them nude. Considering the price of photography from a gallery, the book is well worth the price."
1,lexmark 50/60,"My purchase did not turn out to well, due to my fault. I ordered the wrong one. But again it was my own fault. I didn't check better. So it is money that I didn't have."
5,Great Buy,Arrived on time and at a good price. Well Packaged. Put the product in the printer and it functioned as it should.
4,"Vicious, clever Korean slasher.","Vicious, gory Korean number about a group of young adults gathering to reunite with an ailing school teacher.Turns the slasher genre on it's head and spins it 'till it's dizzy.Bloody Reunion"
5,Very good movie.,"Good plot twists, interesting characters.Pretty straightforward; more a horror movie than a suspense movie."
4,Wow!,"A horror film buff, I can't believe I had never heard of this movie until I came across it On Demand. Not a fan of gore, though it comes with the territory, I'm intrigued with Asian horror. The genre breaks out of the box with twists and a super high ""creepiness"" factor. Bloody Reunion (To Sir With Love) is no exception. This flick is a labyrinth of mind games and creepy moments that transition into true horror. In a short time frame, Bloody Reunion weaves a puzzling, frightening, psychological and surprising blanket of terror. It jumps into your conciousness and leaves you unnerved. There are no boring spots and unneccesary explanations. There is definitely gore, but it's not the kind usually stirred up by the typical knife-wielding villain. NOT for kids."
2,Complete Balance,"Did not work for me, day and night Hot Flashes and sweating were as if I had not taken anything. Might work for others, but no tme."
5,The product is great,I've been saying this is a great product for a long time. That's why I purchase it and why I will continue to buy it.
2,Worked at one time,This is the first product I used when I first became bothered with constant hot flashes. It seemed to work fine. Then about a year later the hot flashes began to re-occur. I was still taking the product but it was obviously not working for me anymore. I switched products (to Estroven) and I'm hot flash free again.
4,a great gripper,"I HAVE ONLY USED THIS TOOL A COUPLE OF TIMES SO FAR, BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN A GREAT TOOL TO GRIP ONTO JUST ABOUT ANY SIZE BOLT. EVEN STRIP-OUT BOLT'S. THIS IS A VERY, GOOD TOOL TO HAVE IN YOUR TOOLBOX FOR ANY PURPOSE."
4,Bionic wrench,Serves the purpose for my husband who has no strength in his hands. Need 7 more words to publish this
1,Disappointing,"I have plenty of sockets and adjustable wrenches, and bought this because I thought it might get a rounded off brass nut out of a shower valve. The nut got rounded off even though I was using a properly sized socket, because it was so tight. There was room to put this on, which probably isn't true of a lot of situations. I don't consider myself weak, but even with two hands plus a plastic zip tie to keep the handles together, I could not. The amount of force I needed to apply to the nut was just too great, so the handles were forced apart and....the bionic wrench rounded the nut off even more. If a nut wasn't so tough and rounded off, this would probably work fine, but I don't see the advantage over a plain old adjustable wrench."
4,Works Well,"Easy to attach and works well enough. On my car, I can't put the arms down and have the rack on the trunk when I'm not carrying my bike. But other than that, works well. I did use some zip-ties to anchor the excess strap length so they wouldn't flap in the wind."
4,Excellent product,"It is a very well made bike rack, looks good was very easy to install.I have one full/large size bike which I am able to mount and move easily.I would have given it full five stars; the rack mounnting tie down straps are very long so I had to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase some velcro tie straps to roll and secure the extra length. With that done it has become an excellent product."
4,it works as a bike rack,"for the price i am satisfied with my rack, however i had a hard time fitting two bikes on it and as a warning to future buyers, put tape to cover the screws on the rack so you don't scratch your car. other than that this rack takes up very little space, i can still park my car in my garage without any problems closing it, i drive a Camry 2007, this rack can be folded up easily and the bikes go on and off of the rack very easily as well."
4,Great for the price,"After spending all of my money on a new mountain bike, I had very little money left for all the accessories. Luckily this bike rack was inexpensive, and arrived in two days with Amazon Prime. I've used it almost every other day to go riding after work. I have probably put 500 miles on it with a bike attached, It is still snug without any retightening. It is great for one bike, I keep it on the middle hook. When I needed to attach my friend's bike, it fit with very little effort. I just don't see three bikes fitting on this rack.The one major problem with this rack is that the rubber hooks the bike attaches to can slide. I don't attach my bike tightly against my car to prevent the pedal from scratching. After driving, the mounts gradually move up the rack. Other than that it is a good rack for the price."
4,This rack served its purpose well.,"This rack successfully made it 1,4000 miles over three days with one road bike on a 1997 Toyota Camry. It was stable and secure the whole way. I don't know if I would recommend it for heavy regular use, but for $50, it was a decent deal."
1,didn't fit car.,"It would have been nice to know exactly what kind of car it fit on. I felt it wasn't as advertised or pictured. As a result, would be leery of buying anything besides books from Amazon again."
3,Defective Rack? Used for 2 months,"Eager to try out my new rack going by the purchaser reviews, I Bought this rack in June of 2011. I used the rack during short and long road trips. One of the brackets that the bike rests on (the part the ties affix to) slides out of place all the time. I have tried several different ways of securing my bike and either way the bracket still moves and the while supporting one bike? I have traveled with 2 bikes and I am not so sure how you can fit a third one on this particular rack? I have written the Manufacturer hopefully they warranty this product some how. I will probably not purchase another brand of Hollywoood racks again. I guess it depends on what Hollywood Racks custumer service says."
4,Great little rack!,"This rack is a really small and simple design. But it works fantastically. You can cinch it down so it won't budge at all and then adding the bike you just double check to make sure everything isn't moving. I haven't attached more than one bike at a time to this and I would be hesistant to attach two additional bikes including my own, it seems the bikes would be exceptionally close together but again, I haven't tried this yet. I haven't had to use it much yet so I don't know how it holds up overtime but for the few times I've had it I wasn't worried at all that if anything would happen to my bike, it wouldn't be because of the rack."
3,"Almost, not quite...","This rack was very easy to get onto the trunk of the Chevy Malibu I rented. What proved significantly more difficult was getting 3 bikes onto the rack. 2 are extra small frames and wouldn't easily slide back. I wouldn't think this rack would work with youth cycles. Because we didn't feel like removing pedals, we were only able to get 2 bikes onto the rack, not 3. It really put a damper on the weekend."
1,Feelin' Lucky?,I would not recommend this product. My very nice bike was almost all over the freeway. One of the rubber bike mounts popped off and the bike was hanging by the safety strap. I think I will spend a bit extra and try the Thule.
4,Good Rack for the Money,"Works great with round tube frames. Easy to setup and seems to be pretty sturdy when mounted. I had some trouble mounting an oval tube full suspension bike in a normal configuration, but it could be done."
4,"Does the job, sturdy.","Have used it twice so far for short trips. Secures the bike(s) well. Don't see how I could get 3 bikes on it without destroying the trunk of my Camry; maybe it could squeeze a kid's bike in. Took a bit of juggling to get 2 adult bikes on it, but it manages. Overall a good buy for the price."
5,Very Pleased,I bought this bike rack because it got good reviews and I'm glad I did! It works great and I'm very pleased.
4,Travel with Bike a whole lot easier..,"Before I use to have to put my bike in the trunk of my Accord. That meant taking the front wheel off, dropping the back seats so the bike could fit. Yeah that gets old, quick and fast. I didnt have a roof rack, nor wanted to spend a lot of cash for one. The Hollywood rack was calling me to give it a try. Very simple installation to your trunk, seems sturdy for 2 bikes, 3 maybe pushing it. I have driven on streets and highways, seems stable. Will test the strength this weekend, I have a hour drive with my Specialized hybrid, and my friend's Specialized road. Hope all goes well on the ride to and fro. But would recommend this rack, to anyone that may ask my opinion."
4,Felt Solid -But didn't fit on our '07 Toyota Corolla with Spoiler,"The product feels really solid, the clamps and constraints seemed well made and tight, unfortunately we could not get it to fit right on our '07 Toyota Corolla with a spoiler. If they tweak some things to allow it to fit, we'll definitely look at their products again in the future."
4,Good product. Does the job.,"I bought this to transport my mountain bike when I moved from Utah to San Diego. Rack mounted fine to my Highlander. Initially fitting the bike to the frame required the purchase of a frame adapter ($15 on amazon) because the support arms were just a little too wide for my small frame.I was a little concerned about the straps coming loose because of the long drive and some of the reviews I read. I tied the loose straps off with a clove hitch (simple knot) onto the same rack support bars. I then checked the straps religiously. They held firm, though there was tiny bit of slack in the lower straps, I think just from the bike getting everything more taut than I could pull it.I'd recommend this product and would buy it again."
1,Does not fit on my car!,"I purchased this item online after checking to make sure that I would be able to fit this product on my 2011 Nissan Sentra. I received it quickly, read the manual and tired to install, but the trunk would not cose with the product attached. This DOES NOT fit on a nissan sentra, regardless of what the manufacturer claims. Made for a difficult situation trying to get 2 bikes to a triathalon."
2,"Don't like the strap, hard to install on the car.","The instruction video makes it look like it is so easy to install this thing to the car.I have to say it's not. It slips easily that I wish I had a third hand to hold onto the thing while I tighten the knob. Also the mechanism to tighten the strap is very poorly designed. Make sure the strap is not pushing the release tab, otherwise the strings will get loose.It does what it needs to do but just as other review says it get loosen over time, so I find myself driving slowly and constantly checking the rear mirror to make sure the rack is not falling. Don't really feel safe to run high speed on freeways.I regret this purchase but don't have much choice for rack that fits my sedan and rack that fits my budget so I'm gonna stick with it."
1,way too small for two bikes unless you take the pedals off your bike,I wish I didn't listen to the good reviews. THis product sucks. Crappy instructions. Two small to put on two adult bikes. Would never buy again.
5,"great choice, I recommend it","I'm very satisfied with this item. it might not be as fancy as the $90 ones , but its definitely as useful and efficient."
3,Toyota Venza,I gave it three stars. I figured that fair enough. I can't give it one nore can I give it five cause I am unable to use it. Just want to warn anyone who plans on mounting this thing to a Toyota Venza.DONT!! It's not compatible.
5,Great Bike Rack,"Great Product!!! Used bike rack this past week to go camping. Very easy to install and the bikes stayed in place, no bouncing around. Would recommend this product."
4,Good bike rack,I have a geo metro and this thing fits it really well. Although my hatch will not stay open with it on... could be my hydrolics though since its an older car. I havent had any problems with it going around town. My fiance and his best friend say its really nice and often borrow it. I have yet to put three bikes on it. So I cant say for that. But I like it for one or two bikes for short distances. Dont know how it would do for long trips. Might have to stop and adjust the straps every once in a while. It does have lots of stabilizers though and it never sways or gets lopsided like some cheap bike rack would. I would feel comfortable taking it for trips.
4,nice rack,"Have used this rack for about a month just around town for hauling 2 bikes - one adult, one kids. So far so good. Don't think I'd try to add another bike unless absolutely necessary. The rack is solidly mounted and very little sway with the bikes on. No issues at all with the rubber fasteners coming off. It was a little tricky adjusting the arms to fit over the trunk but since the rack is staying on the car, I only had to do this once. Also the clips on the middle tie-downs which are supposed to go on the side of the trunk or gate do not fit the side of the trunk of my car (08 Malibu) so they are also attached to the top of the trunk. As I said no problems with stability so no issue there.All in all, a good product for the price."
4,Nice Rack.,"I use it on a Honda Civic. Easy to assemble. Works fine, may cause minor scratches on car, but the scratches can be prevented if you are careful."
4,Perfect for 2 bikes,"I got this bike rack for my son-in-law to use on their Sonata. He thinks this is a perfect rack for two bike. Would be tight for a third bike, unless it's a kids bike. One he figured how to get the rack on the trunk, its's easy to get on and off."
4,Does the job,"Although I could never imagine putting three bikes on this rack, it does the job for two bikes and fits on my 1992 Saturn Sedan (with small spoiler).I haven't cut the extra long straps yet but plan to in the near future. Very easy to take on and off. Its also a good idea to strap down that front tire to keep it from spinning. I'm glad I didn't spend the additional money or a higher-end rack since this one does the job without worries.Great product with the proper installation and modifications as needed.Rack arrived within 2 or 3 days of ordering from Amazon."
4,Good for my small car,"I use this rack on my Kia Spectra and it holds tight. It fits in the trunk when not in use. It was kind of a pain to put on the first time because of all of the straps. I was nervous that I had not pulled them all tight enough, but it held fast. Be sure to tighten the straps every time you put your bike back on."
2,Scratched Trunk,I bought this bike rack and followed the instructions to a T and after coming back from the park with our 2 bikes on the back I noticed scratches on the paint i mean deep scratches not the kind you can buff out so if your using this rack go very slow and place towels or something underneath so it doesnt damage your car
4,worth the money,"I've owned this rack for about 2 months now, and i've had no bad experiences yet!The only two negative aspects were that when it arrived it was in pieces in the box, so i had to do some assembling. Also with smaller size frames it can be a bit of a hassle trying to fit the bikes on.I use it on my mazda 3 hatchback all the time and at first I was worried about all the weight being applied to my rear windshield. But now, after about 20 uses i have no worries.I have carried one full suspension bike and one hardtail bike at the same time, and one 26"" bike and one 29"" bike at the same time. I'd be weary putting three bikes on the rack only because in my case the rack rests upon glass.Overall this rack may be on the inexpensive side but that doesn't mean it is cheap! It is well designed, and functions perfectly."
4,Not great but works.,"It's an OK bike rack. It works fine on a 97 Altima and just barely on a 2007 CRV. Bikes won't fall off but they do swing a bit and can scratch the car with pedals or scratch themselves if there are multiple bikes on the rack. For the price it is fine for my needs - 5 mile ride to the trails once a week. In terms of convenience, this does not come close to a roof rack and some other trunk racks are probably better."
1,DANGEROUS - DO NOT BUY,"This product will NOT support more than one bike. We used it for one bike for several months without issue, placing the bike in the middle set of 'saddles' (for lack of a better word). However, the first time we used it with two bikes, the outermost bike fell off the rack and went flying down the interstate. The bike was totaled, but thankfully no one was behind us or there could have been a serious accident. PLEASE BE ADVISED- if you do choose to purchase this rack for one bike, do NOT use the outermost 'saddles'."
4,state park,"I purchase the Hollywood 1 week b4 my departure to Itasca State park in MN. It got here (Minnetonka, MN) in record time. To make a long story short. The bike rack work perfectly. I put 1 male, 1 female and a tag-along went on the rack and it stayed secure the entire trip!!! In reading other reviews they said things came loose. Not with this one. As long as the straps are tight, the rack will not shift and move. It was a four and change hour drive and we could have gone longer without any problems. I would definately recommend this product. I gave it 4 stars because nothing is perfect. I had to get under the car to do two straps. : )"
3,CAUTION.....does not fit cars with rear spoilers,"Bought this product based on the review coments shared by all. The good things about the rack are good construction and ease of use but the biggest problem is that there is no comment about it not fitting sedans with rear spoilers. The rack does not fix corolla S sedans and similar. Tried all possible ways to make it work on mine and a friend's sport model, same problem, with best possible fitting, it sits on the spoiler and I am afraid, with two bikes loaded, chances of spoiler damage are very high.CONFIRMED BY MANUFAFCTURER SUPPORT THAT THIS RACK IS NOT APPROVED FOR CARS WITH SPOILERS."
4,Great for the money.,"Fits my 2000 Honda Accord with no problem. Not exactly sure how it can carry 3 bikes without scratching the car, but two bikes will work fine. For the money, you can't beat this product. I have driven with this carrier on the car at highway speeds with no problem. I do wish there were some form of a locking strap for the tie downs. I wrap the excess into the truck and tie it down to the inside of the trunk. Secures the carrier to the car even more."
3,quick and dirty,This is a cheap bike rack that is easy to put on and off your car. It is ok if you just need to take 1-2 bikes somewhere close by for a short period of time. But I have no idea how to fit 3 bikes on it or how to drive with it on a freeway - it does not seam to be all that sturdy for that. We could not even put 2 mountain bikes on it on a Toyota corolla because they would scrape the road that way. Nissan Altima also required some tricking to put 1 mountain and 1 road bike on it. Overall - it is a good cheap rack if you just need to take a bike to a class within a city. I would not leave this on your car forever - just remove it when you are parked and put it inside of your car while your are riding. It is really easy for it to be taken off (read - stolen).
3,It doesn't fit all cars,"After reading the fabulous reviews on this product, I quickly ordered it for myself. As soon as it arrived, I tried to install it but according to the fit guide, my vehicle, Volvo V70 station wagon does not accommodate this bike rack. Woe was my expectation. I'm not sure how you can check if it fits your car but you should research this first. According the fit guide, I should buy a hitch rack instead."
3,Surprised nobody has had this problem...,"Overall, I like the rack but there are a couple of things I do not like. First, like one poster also mentioned, the long straps just dangle in the wind unless you use a rubber band to wrap them up with. I will probably just cut the excess off because the bands will end up breaking.Also, I have a Trek mountain bike and I can only put it on the back (the farthest out) rungs on the rack. If I try to use the others, the pedal hits my car! (yes I tried rotating it, but it definitely hits the car) I do not need to put 3 bikes on the rack, but I definitely wanted to be able to put 2 on it but I can't figure out how this is possible. I have a Corolla so I would have thought this would not be an issue with this car.Other than that, it stays put surprisingly well, and I am fairly content."
4,"It's okay, but i was a little disappointed no new tracks.","I would buy greatest hits import with extra tracks before buying this. Contains: I heard a rumour, i can't help it, movin' on, give it all up for love, last thing on my mind, robert de niro's waiting, through a childs eyes, young at heart , dream baby, state i'm in, more than physical, doctor love, true confessions, i can't let you go, outta sight."
4,Son loves it,My son (newly 6) loves this toy. It comes with easy to follow step-by-step instructions. He is able to put it together with my help (pointing out in the instructions which part/step is next). I'm pleased with the quality and size of the finished product. I really like that it can make 2 toys--a submarine or a dune buggy--with the same parts. I'm ordering several and giving them as gifts to his classmates next year. It is a great deal.
4,A Little Too Simple,"Like all of the GI Joe and Tonka Lego-compatible sets, there are plenty of special pieces not found in other sets. The directions are pretty clear, but do not use the Lego/Mega Blok standard of highlighting the new pieces. The set also includes a fully posable figure (knees, elbows, ankles, wrists, hips, shoulders, and neck).This is an interesting model as it is supposed to be underwater, but the included figure has no diving equipment. There are also no controls in the cockpit (unusual for these types of models).This model comes with two launchers that shoot missiles at the touch of a button thus making it inappropriate for some children."
2,silly mystery set in small-town Arizona....,"Garrison Allen, who wrote at least one mystery under the name Gary Amo, starts off the ""Big Mike"" series with a very silly mystery. Penelope Warren, former Marine and current bookstore owner comes home one night to find the ""First Lady of Empty Creek"" dead, stabbed with a knife with a penny glued to the handle. Then, we meet all sorts of eccentrics in Empty Creek, and we see how ridicilous parts of this story are. Seems the villian likes to wear George Bush masks. Allen stoops to self-promoting as he uses another one of his books as a plot device to help find something crucial. I can only hope the subsequent books aren't like this."
4,Good sophomore CD,"Present/FutureThis second disc from Eagle Eye Cherry is a little poppier, a little jazzier, than his first. Interesting lyrics as always, it is a good second effort. Fans of his vocal style wont be disappointed."
2,Norton who???,"Version 1.0 is average at best and this is also only able to run in OS 9 or lower. It does not run natively in OS X, but they have come out with a 2.0 version. The 1.0 version does have good optimization and defragmenting properties, but the 2.0 version has included Alsoft's Disk Warrior. Makes one wonder why Symantec would share the spotlight with another software company. I know why but will remain silent at this time..."
2,promising but ultimately boring,"I love Brazilian music and bossa nova. I thought this set held real promise based on having heard a few cuts and an interview with Souza.But the collection takes no risks and ultimately is boring. Almost all of the familiar tunes (e.g., the James Taylor cut)add nothing to the original and this listener concluded: ""Why bother?"""
3,"Nice, but a bit soporific...","This has some interesting treatments and arrangements of old favorites by Joni Mitchell, Steely Dan, et al, arranged by Larry Klein, Mitchell's arranger as well as of other female vocalists of note. Souza's voice is somewhat delicate and her intonations become repetitive after awhile. I am guessing that the traditional bossa nova singing has this sort of monotonous inflection as a feature, recollecting music of Astrud Gilberto and Jobim. But, whereas, Jobim and Gilberto had exquisite voices, souza's voice has an irritating sameness. Strictly my tastes, however; someone else might love it, if they are looking for a smooth, uninflected treatment. It's hard to not compare these to the well-loved originals, however, and, to my ear, they suffer by the comparison. I got moderate enjoyment from this CD."
2,unhappy with this cd,I had heard songs by this artist and thought I would try an album...very dissappointed in it..it will go to the Goodwill...since I can't return it...
4,Luciano Souza Making Her Way,"Luciano Souza has quietly been making her way in the planes of the jazz and Latin music world, blending the two, collaborating with great musicians of her native Brazil and the US. The New Bossa Nova works a seam of American music with a bossa sensibility, something in reverse to the original movement which had US jazzers collaborating with Brazilian musicians on Brazilian songs. The songs are fine and the treatment fine as well. Gentle, more on the quiet side. Evening at dusk music with the light still leaking over the horizon from the sun."
1,What's in it?,"Come on, guys! At least give us a hint what movies are included. Do you expect us to shell out the money for this with no indication what we're getting? The photo seems to show a set of maybe five or six DVDs. And the thing is called a ""double feature collection."" Does that mean two films per disc? Give me some information and maybe I'll buy it!"
2,"ummm, okaaaaaaaay!","yeah. Proto Zoa in this movie is really bad. The other one in teh first 2 was great. it's wierd how Zenon is still friends with him. for one thing, the makers of this movie think that in the future, everythings gona have the theme of ""galactic"", cosmic, lunar, etc. not gona happen. the only songs I KINDA like are All About you and the one by Selena. in the movie, Selena looks punk. is it just me or does she look punk? hm. *shrugs* well, don't waste your money."
4,not bad a review from kevin f,all the songs are werid but the pepole ho sing it sing it really will i think everybody should buy this soundtrack
1,God help us!,"What is this? This is a sorry excuse to make some money for Disney! I mean, what do I have to say?"
2,After Chapter 4,"I said ""Ummm"" I read the last chapter Then I said ""No"" and decied to exchange it for Andrea Kane believe me I did not even think to read the end until I got there. I just wasnt captured. Although I did like the way the heroine took charge when the guy could not even control his own house but however managed to get a castle after being poor that just did not make sense. ..."
3,IT'S ALRIGHT,COMING FROM BRISICK I WAS EXPECTING MORE OF A BOOK ON SURFING.THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO PICS ON SURFING(BAD).TOO MUCH ON BRASIL.SOME OF THE STORIES ARE ENTERTAINING THOUGH.
2,"Lots of Photos, little text","Note: this book is mostly photographs and images, with very little text. Not that there is anything wrong with it, it's just that I expected a lot more reading material. The book took me less than an hour to read cover to cover."
4,well done,Could a boy falling from the sky be a more appropriate cover for a book that reads more like a diary confession than the average book you find on the shelves... ? Jamie Brisick has achieved a personal height here. I read his work in Surfing magazine for years which was average and moderately entertaining. His book comes from the heart. A hundred times deeper than previous texts. This book is like a perfect blueprint for anyone wanting interested in communicating the journey into the interior. Well done.
1,Not As Promoted,I bought 2 of these monitors. One arrived defective with a line showing across the middle of the screen. The other worked just like a regular monitor should work (I dont see the big deal about these monitors) and after 1 year it continuously blinks (like 100times/minute). In other words it is not usable. I would expect for this kind of money better quality. You should compare the cost of buying an inexpensive monitor ($200-$300) and throwing it away in a year or two rather than paying the premium for Samsung SyncMaster 214T.
5,Samsung SyncMaster 214T,"I've used the 213T before and wanted to match that display and the 214T is a much better monitor for the price, clear with great colors, a bit smaller frame also."
3,Not As Good as the First,"Decent selection, but nowhere near the album that Motown Christmas 1 was. I probably would not recommend this album."
1,Absolute Trash,"I bought this book for my two boys but after reading it first, I decided not to give it to them. The author advocates keeping scripture memorized so it can essentially be used as a weapon. I found the messages to be wholly opposite Christian teachings. One must wonder if the author himself carries God's word in his heart or is simply trying to exploit the faithful for his own personal gain."
2,The Bad Game,"This game is very boring, it makes Barney look fun. In truth this game is very tedious because the levels are too easy, and the last on is the easiest, I do not recommend this game."
3,Good solid debut.,"I heard this cat a few months back doing a track with EL DA SENSEI and PACE WON called ""different rap species"" and was immediately impressed at how he held his own with those 2 mc's.His delivery is fast, punchy, hard-hitting with grest metaphors and punchlines. Also his confidence on the mic makes him a little bit more worthwhile than most of the other new mc's you'll hear nowadays. There's no ""bling-bling"" chatter or ""player-isms"" involved ANYWHERE on this, just pure hip-hop. There's a total of 14 tracks on the album (not including the intro and interlude ""go for yours"") and most of them are hot to death. The stand out cuts are ""its over"", ""make way"", ""we eatz"", the awesome ""different rap species"", ""el gant"", ""smashed it"", ""must be nice"" and ""back stabberz"". As you can see there's a modest helping for you to enjoy. The rest of the tracks i didnt mention range from ""not bad"" to ""good"" so this should be one for your collection. Peep it out."
3,They're okay.,We're having a little boy and live in the caribbean so these shorts are perfect for the weather. The color was a bit faded so it wasn't such a good quality but they're okay for a baby.
4,Runs big!!,"They do run big, but babies grow! No too much of a problem. They are soft, and loose for summer. Its the kind of cotton that get softer when you wash. The colors are that softer faded colors, love it. Can't wait for the other colors to arrive."
1,BAD SERVICE,This company will take your order for parts THEY DO NOT HAVE IN STOCK!!!! Then they will only refund part of your money!! I have had to file many complaints against this company with Amazon! AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!!
2,400 lbs no way,"This cart will only hold about 150 lbs if you want to move the cart. The wheels/rims are all plastic, and they are about 1 inch wide. With 200 lbs (4 40 lbs bags) the wheels fold under themselves. Also once you move off the driveway on to the lawn, you can not move the unit because of the skinner wheels (150 lbs load). The construction of the cart is such that if you put something heavy it will bend the bottom panels, because there no support beams. If you want to move a few plants it is OK."
1,Bully Fold-Flat Falls Flat on Quality,"I received the Bully Fold-Flat in an undamaged carton. I expected the product to be great. What a disappointment! Several of the gromets that hold the cart together were dislodged. Some were loose in the box, but others were missing. We decided not to order another cart since the gromet form of attachment seems to be a fatal flaw in the product."
5,Bully 21122 Fold-Flat Garden Cart,I got this gift for my husband as a Christmas gift and he just loves it! It is easy to fold up to store in the shed and fold out for use. Would highly recommend if you need to save storage space
4,Bully Boy Cart,"It is a handy cart, easy to use and travels well over obstacles with those wonderful large wheels. My one concern is the plastic wheel rims, I am afraid if it got too full they may snap and break. Metal would have been better. But I like the product. Gramma"
5,Highly recommended,"Yoel Ben-Simhon conceived of this music and of the Sultana Ensemble as a way of preserving various Middle Eastern musical traditions, connecting those traditions to Western musical styles (e.g. jazz), and promoting a musical dialogue between Arabs and Jews. That is admirable enough, but he and his accomplished bandmates have also crafted a terrific album, full of energy and emotion, mystical power and beauty. Beyond easy categorization, very accessible, and highly recommended."
4,I Dare You To Buy This!,"This is a great little Ol' sampler! 16 tracks...68 Minutes {before, you come down!}. It's a tribute to something green & good. From the pounding of: ""Sweet Leaf"" by The Storm Orphans, thro' to: ""Rainy Day Woman# 12 & 35"" by: A Subtle Plague, this is a sweet smooth ride! ""Bass Strings"" is an ode To Country Joe, that works well. ""Panama Red"" is closer to grunge than anything else BUT, it's smokin'. Billy Bardo, does a cool rendition of a Johnny Paycheck classic {and since nobody listens to Johnny Paycheck, it's new to all of us!}. Gem's from: John Prine, {Illegal Smile),Bob Marley {Kaya) & Cab Calloway {Reefer Man} are re-done & twisted sideways by all these artists, just to mess with your head!This is indeed fun & strange, BUT, it's a fine collection of seeds & stems.This is for every Deadheads Christmas list!...And, don't forget the cool cover art by: Gilbert {""The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers""} Shelton. This is GOOD STUFF !!!I don't need to dare you, do I?"
5,A must read for all Christians who want to know the truth.,This book takes the mystery out of the learning the Bible and explains the simple truths of the Bible in a plain and easy way to understand God's message. This non-denominational view of the Bible is refreshing as well as honest. I thoroughly enjoyed the book by this anointed man of God; I am sure you will to.
5,Excellent Bible Based Information,I used this book for l7 years in a teaching ministry. Many students of the Bible learned Bible truths through the techings of Bro. Dake.
4,All the Details,"Meticulous in its detail, God's Plan for Man covers everything from the origin of all things, the various dispensations, historical dealings with man, God's present dealings with man, and God's future dealings with man. God's Plan for Man is so full of information, it's basically a text book. In fact, it was originally designed as a correspondence course stated to be equivalent to a three year Bible program.Although I disagree with some of the doctrine, this book covers nearly every aspect of the Bible and should be on the shelf of every serious medium to advanced student of the Bible.Five W's of God"
3,Response to review:,"...Dake is the father of many charismatic Christian movements such as the ""Toronto Blessing"" movement that was popularized in at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Christian Fellowship. He was also influential on many other movements as well. Not the least of which is the entire Dake-Bonoist revival. This thing is especially important to the young people and I think it is shortsited to discount him outright. Consider what Dake-Bonoism is doing for our young people. It's a religous answer to what the Straight-Edge movement is trying to answer is the modern american punk Scene. This book is the plan. Dake & Bono inclusive."
1,I was wrong in my previous review.,"I recommended this work earlier (A reader from Everett, WA)I have been forced to reconsider my opinions on this work and on the Dake Annotated Reference Bible as well. Dake is the godfather of modern day Pentecostal-Latter Rain-Toronto Vineyard Teachings, and cannot be recommended except as a reference to Bleeding Edge Pentecostal errors.I retract my recommendation and apologize for leading astray.For more information on these works try a search engine with Dake and Heresy."
1,What a load of Rubbish !!!!!,"Thousands of years after the birth of Christianity, generations of Theologians has come and gone, many more thousands of different sects of the Christianity, not to mention the fact that we can't even get a room-full of Christian Apologetics to agree on what God is all about .....Yet along comes Finis J., Sr Dake with his book and figured it all out.... OH PLEASE!!!!! Let me remind Finis and my fellow readers of what god himself had said:Isaiah55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.Therefore, to pretend to know gods plan is nothing short of buffoonery."
4,Excellent study content,"This is a Great source of reference for anyone who enjoys studying, teaching, and ministering the Word of God. Mr. Dake leaves no stone unturned, but looks at all aspects of a topic and using an abundance of scripture to validate his position. Keep in mind this is basically a theogolical commentary. But with plenty of scriptural truth for support.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the layout, it is a little cluttered and the text is really small. But again I would like to stress this is a very, very good piece of work."
3,I like the written contents,"I like the written contents of this book. I am not a new knitter so I enjoyed reading and learning this method of knitting. Ever since I started knitting the ""Heretics"" way, my knitting has become much more beautiful and even.On the down side, this book is self published and boy does it show. The paper is thin, many of the pictures and illustrations are so unclear they might as well not be there at all.It was worth buying the book, but I wish it was better published and had a more professional polish."
4,a little gem,"I saw Annie Modesitt demonstrate ""combination knitting"" on Knitty Gritty and almost passed out with joy! It seemed like something that had been created just for ME. This book does not disappoint. It's a grab-bag of priceless tips and tricks, all presented with a light-hearted style (my favorite lines: ""a cable is simply a rib with high aspirations"" and ""sometimes it feels that you need a gynecological degree to pull your yarn from the center of a ball"")While it is true that the illustrations are definitely not high-resolution, to me that adds to the ""secret tricks of the trade"" feel. The Combination Knitting overview is fascinating!"
3,Wish it had more info on the process...,"I purchased this book because it was supposed to describe the process of ""Speed"" or ""Combination"" knitting. I love my yarns and needles and the adulation that comes with being crafty ;o) but I am sometimes discouraged with how long it takes me to make things that aren't for babies and was looking for a way to speed it up a bit. I have just begun to read this book but have to say, it doesn't show me anything I didn't already learn about combination knitting from the internet. I am disappointed because I would love to be able to knit without watching every stitch but think I will enjoy reading it anyway. I just can't recommend purchasing it to anyone else, borrow it from a friend or the library if you can."
5,The Art and Laughter of Knitting,"Unusualy appealing knitting book for every level of knitter. As an experienced knitting teacher, this is the first book I recommend to my students: You can actually learn to knit with it. And have a few laughs while you're at it. And be inspired by the possibilities. The diagrams and pictures are useful: quite clear, well thought out and expertly reproduced. It's also a personal book: we learn about how this knitter came into being, and the positive reinforcement for every style of knitting is ever-present and heart-felt. There are many useful techniques that are not presented elsewhere. We get to see some of the possibilities inherent in knitting as well in the millinery and wire knitting sections. And while covering the basics, it's not at all dumbed down; in fact, she assumes you have the knowledge and ability to accomplish whatever you want to do ... Here's a smorgasbord of technique and prose to help you move along the knitting path."
3,A little disappointed,"This is the only book oriented towards combination knitting, so I was eager to get it. I've been knitting like the author all my life and I don't think so much emphasis is needed on anger management or how to tell other knitters to leave you alone. I also did not need so much information on her family or her personal history. I like her notation, which can be used with any knitting method, and the book includes some tips that are useful. If she got an editor that would help her correct the typos, explain some stuff with more clarity, and especially crop out the chatter, this could become a really good book."
3,a little disappointed,"I have been knitting for about 48 years so I feel I have ground for informed opinion on knitting books. I tried some of her methods and found them unworkable in comparison to say, Elizabeth Zimmerman's. She has a different way of joining in new yarn that is too visible from the outside. I didn't care at all for the knitted wire objects. What's the point?I liked her attitude though, in that she believes she has the right to do it anyway she likes. And she does. She needs better illustrations. Maybe tone down the bragging a little. That said, she wrote a book and got it published. Good for her. I haven't."
1,Disappointed,"Was thoroughly disappointed with this book. It is all black and white, almost looks like a homemade photocopy. The information isn't that great either. Had I known it was not in color, I would not have purchased it."
2,Only for fans,"I have liked many of Anne Modesitt's patterns, so when I saw the book avail, I bought sight unseen. I wish I hadn't. First of all, it's obviously self-published, which is reflected in the quality of the paper and the quality of the information. An editor and a proofer would have been a blessing to this book.The author seems intent on letting us know that she can doing things ""HER WAY"" and no one should tell her she can't. These numerous passages (because oh, are they numerous) can be made bearable by singing MY WAY everytime you come across them--and boy, will you come across them. The bulk of the book is about how she became a knitter and how knitters should be more snuggly to each other.There are some good instructions, but nothing you can't get in better and less self-congratulatory books. And the patterns...well...they aren't jumping to the top of my queue.All in all, your library won't suffer if you let this one pass you by and just stick to her patterns (which are lovely)."
2,Also Dissapointed!,"While this book is well written, it does not offer much new information for experience knitters. The book itself is of poor quality printing and not worth the money I paid for it. The least the author could have done is to include clear pictures and use a better quality print and bind for her book. A real dissapointment and I cannot recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"This looks and feels like a homemade book or a throwback to the fifties. It is nice that the author tells us that there is no wrong way to knit, but I expected much more for the price of this book. ""Knitting for Anarchists' by Anna Zilboorg is better."
1,Not so much.,Not really impressed with this book. It really suffers from lack of skillful editing. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Not all it is cracked up to be and neither is she!,"I know it is spiral bound, but the cost should reflect that.The information in it can easily be found elsewhere and in a format that is much easier to read and perhaps at a better price. Having read her blog many times, I expected something a little less dry, but I think she puts the best(and sometimes the worst) of herself in the blog and not in her books."
5,A Logical Logic Text,This text bring logic into the real world. It is especially good in its treatment of validity and conditionals. It treats implication as the key to conditionals. It rejects the pernicious material conditional as the best interpretation of conditionals. This bold and conmmon sense approach is rare by other logic texts.
5,The only book I have read multiple times,"I first read this book when I was in 5th or 6th grade...20 years ago. It was the first book which ""hit me"", that touched me. It is also the only book I would go back to the library to check out year after year, the only book I have read over and over. The fact I remember the title 20 years later says something. It has to have been at least 14 or 15 years since I last read it...I plan on purchasing it so I can enjoy it again. A story written in 1978 which still resonates today, simply beautiful."
2,A throwaway,"A few weeks ago I heard a wonderful performance by Les Paul and Marian McPartland on her Public Radio jazz program, and I promptly ordered this CD. Much to my disappointment, it finally arrived. I found it to be, at best, soporific. I'll probably give it to my father-in-law, who may find an appreciative space for it on the shelf next to Lawrence Welk."
2,ive seen better,"this book was like the 1st mortal kombat guide book and the 2nd put in one it had no movie previews in it. and it only coverd mortal kombat 1 and 2, not 3 and ultiment 3"
2,just o.k.,"""Courage"" is just o.k. Neither I nor my son found the pictures that compelling. And we both seemed to think the book was longer than it needed to be. Nice premise, but - somehow - lacking."
1,Bad Examples of Courage,"This book would be worth reading if it was about half as long, needed to be severely edited. Seemed like there was a length requirement because many of the examples of courage were absolutely ridiculous. Courage is a dog hoping for another type of dog food? Really scraped the barrel for examples. Wouldn't want to every read this book to a child. Returned it with all speed."
4,Courage for All,Great book for students graduating from school at multiple levels. Adding your own memories of courage to the book can create a great gift to leave home with.
3,Didn't Change My Life,"Evidently this lyrical and mythological tale has a cult following. For me, it was a hard book to read because I am not fond of fantasy and don't like the idea of angels (which in this case are birds.) I can admit to unknown forces in the universe, but to anthropomorphize them seems silly. However, beneath the mythological fluff of Carey's work there is a solid base of spiritual insight, summed up nicely on p. 169: ""... all creatures inhabit and live within a single field of shared consciousness ... all are projections of a single Being ... all of us ... are differentiated aspects of one conscious and coherent whole."" I am glad I pushed myself through ""Return of the Bird Tribes,"" but will probably not recommend it to others because the mythology is a little too woo-woo (not to say distasteful) to me."
3,yellowed pages,"No ink or pencils markings on the inside but the pages were very yellowed. The outside has a one inch black marker stroke on bottom edge where the pages are. No rips, tears, or creases."
4,Another look inside Haitian culture,"Ms Edwidge Danticat continues to provide us with unique opportunities to look inside Haitian culture and ""After the Dance"" certainly does not disappoint. It is a quick read, though I felt it did not flow as smoothly as some of her other works. Reading about celebration and nostalgia in Haiti is a refreshing break from most of the available literature. It certainly speaks to the amazing resilience and pride that is distinctly Haitian. I certainly would have appreciated photographs/illustrations of some of the events, masks and locales."
5,EXCELLENT Arcade Racing Game!,You won't be disappointed with this racing game. We downloaded the demo and could not wait to purchase the full version of this fast action packed game. There are so many choices and combinations of game play that you will have hours and hours of fun! From adult to four year old (our four year old grandbaby loves it!) there is plenty of action for all. We were amazed at the low cost of such a great racing computer game! Thanks!
1,Pure Trash,"Horible car choices, colors, levels...how many driving games can you fall off the course?The first Need for Speed is better than this game...the controls are horrible, a kid couldnt even play it...unenjoyable...try midtown madness series,need for speed series, hell even test drive."
2,Not as we thought it would be...,"We were looking for a book about the 95th Infantry Division in World War II, so we could trace the route my father-in-law had taken when he was fighting in the mid-1940s. This book was a big disappointment to us, and not worth the high price."
2,Information at best.,"Fodor's See It Vietnam does have a lot of information about the country, it's history and people. Valuable information on how to get there, yet for a book just published it is a little out of date. Lonely Planet's Vietnam has better coverage of places to stay and see. If you are going to Saigon or Hanoi and have a lot of money then this is the guide for you. If you plan to visit other parts of Vietnam and are on a budget, then one of the other guides is your best choice. Buy this one for information and pictures, but get one of the other guides to take with you."
1,Not the original version of 25 Miles!,"Warning. I downloaded the track 25 Miles off this album and it is a live recording, not the originl chart hit. I haven't heard the rest of the album but the version of 25 Miles that's here is not the original. Very disappointed."
5,Edwin Starr,Another artist that I needed to add to my collection. This works as a great replacement for a missing album.
2,Arrived Broken (Not by shipping),This clock looked good and was cheap - too cheap as it turns out. It arrived with the second hand unattached and I returned it. I'm still looking for a cost efficient office wall clock.
5,An Excellent New York Photo Documentary,"As the grandson of NY Daily News photographer Charles Hoff, this book offered much insight in to family (as well as New York) history. Only a hint at the tremendous photographic contribution of the NYDN can be addressed in one book, even in a volume this large. Still, it reveals fascinating insight in to the last eighty years of New York visual history through stunningly beautiful photographs. The quality is only enhanced by the fact that the book was published just prior to the tragic events of September, 2001 -- the book closes with a wonderfful photograph of the World Trade Center, as well as text by Shawn O'Sullivan that in retrospect is perfectly appropriate -- that the picture press remains vigilant in a constantly changing city."
4,Regulators should read it,Economics of Regulation and Antitrust offers a broad conclusion on Regulation and Antitrust policies. The issues are well described and easily to understand. Best suited for graduate students in Economics.
1,Horrible service,"The item did not arrive. Also the mode of shipment was deceptive. It was shipped via FedEx but then transferred to the USPS. Obviously, using two different types of shipping facilities will increase inefficiency and loss of purchase. If Amazon had been explicit about how the book would have been shipped, then I would not have purchased the item. Very disappointing. Barnes and Noble will be the optional choice to meet my needs."
5,Amazing - Touching - Docu,"One Lucky Elephant is a wonderful journey of two ""kindred spirits"" - David Balding and Flora. It reminds me of ""Project Nim"" - amazingly, a mirror image ( a captive elephant this time used in a circus instead of a born in captivity chimpanzee used in a research project ). This docu will touch your heart and foster a thought - a need for a better life for orphaned and captive animals,,,,,hey, the ""best life"" is in the wild with their natural families but if unfortunate to find themselves under our care - we must give them the ""best world"" humanely possible. Did I say humanely? Buy this docu - Flora and David will definitely ""touch you heart"" with their story - one that does not have a Disney-ending."
4,The realities of 'owning' a wild animal,"The notion that anyone or anything will abandon their true nature is a delusion, but maybe it's something we all do when we fall in love. This documentary shows what happens when a truly loving person thinks that their love will be enough for a wild animal to give up being wild. It's not. The road to this discovery is a touching one. The story evolves into one where two caring people have very different ideas on what will make this particular elephant happy. Whether or not 'Flora' ultimately does become lucky is for the viewer to decide."
5,Youthful Feeling,"Viromax gives me a youthful feeling. I long to stay youthful and feel youthful, having a good quality of life. Viromax keeps me young inside.Solaray - ViraMax for Women - 60 capsules"
2,on/off switch is cheap plastic - doesn't look safe,"I ordered this to complete my son's star wars bedroom transformation. If it were made better, it would be very cute. Plug it in and the light saber glows red and looks like a lava lamp. The problem is with the switch. It is very cheaply constructed. Turns on really easily but you have to really press it down to turn it off. Then ours kept blinking on and off even when in the off position.Maybe mine is broken... but it wasn't worth it to us to try and fix or return. It just didn't look safe and I was worried about it being a fire hazard. It is also not very bright, so I wouldn't really use it as a night light. It's more of a novelty item."
3,Nice looking but not good quality.,The product is nice looking and light weight but unfortunately that also means cheap. Within two weeks one of the screws got caught on my jeans and the entire bracelet was in pieces. It's too bad because I really liked it otherwise.
5,linguistic delight,"I will keep it brief because the title of this book explains its subject matter well. This is a well-written, intriguing little book that begs to be pored over at one's leisure. It is a pleasure to read about obscure words and their origins."
1,A USELESS COLLECTION OF WORDS THAT RARELY EVEN EXIST,"I strongly recommend against buying this book. As someone who can pretty much ace an SAT or any vocabulary test, I can tell you that basically no matter who you are, you will find this book usless and boring. Unless you have a better vocabulary than 99.9% of people (I do), you will not know or ever see the majority of these words (I haven't). There are some good ones - less than 10% of them - but if you want to improve your vocaulary, try something else. If you like words that are not even in the dictionary (except maybe Oxford Unabridged), words that never have and never will be used, or words that make you sound so smart that even the smartest 1% of the population won't know what you're saying, you might actually enjoy this book. However, if you don't fit into one of the above catergories: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Try Word Power or Word Smart I & II if you would like to acquire a good vocabulary or sound educated."
4,For Love of Words,"In ""A Word A Day: A Romp Through Some of the Most Unusual and Intriguing Words in English"", the joy of words just shines through; it is a happy book. Very uplifting! All the more impressive because English is not the Gargs' native language."
4,Tinker's Damn,"Well written, poignant, and realistic. Tinker is admirable. Dave O is the kind of man that gives a ""mean of the clothe"" a bad reputation. A wonderful suggested read."
4,Quite good and comprehensive,"This book give us a quite good idea of aquaculture economics, however, some may find it a little confusing and some issues are not so well explained as they should, overall its a good buy."
3,"Good quality and price,too!","This DVD contains the original first 3 episodes that were transfered from the Columbia House Collector's Edition video which had very good quality and they also had the original music (the video),but the DVD didn't,instead it had this slow instrumental music that didn't fit in at all,but anyway it was a very good DVD and I would reccomend it!"
1,A Sad BB Christmas,"I love BB King. He lifts my spirits, elevates my soul, makes me smile, and activates my heart and my foot. That said, this new Xmas album feels as if some producer said, ""BB sells. Xmas sells. A surefire combination!"" and a tired, disinterested BB reported into the studio for duty.""A Christmas Celebration of Hope"" not only lacks hope, it lacks energy, variety, enthusiasm, and everything wonderful about BB King. Sorry BB."
4,A GREAT C.D.FOR THE HOLIDAYS!,"If your looking for a change of pace(this is it)Mr. King is just fantastic none of your everyday Christmas song's here, alot of good BLUES THOUGH!Ill say this album is different take for instance ""Back door santa""(he sneaks in the back door when hubby leaves the house!)(ha) also thrown in are a few New Years songs so if you like the blues and are just a little tired of ""Jingle Bells""this cd is for you!"
3,Not as good as it could have been...,Not as good as it could have been. The down and dirty blues stuff is great but most of the songs are way overproduced.
1,Shake Rattle & Roll,This design does not work well. The rack would shake when you put three bikes on it. The design was such that it would rattle while driving. I returned for a refund.
5,bike rack,"Haven't found a better buy. Best bike rack around. Works for the car, van, trailer, or camper. Amazon was very helpful, and we got free shipping. Great buy."
3,Very simple overview,"Short overview of legal systems. Divided in to Western law, religious law, and traditional law. Doesn't really go into great detail on legal anthropology."
4,Very pleased!,"This wasn't quite as powerful as the dryer at my work, but it was also much quieter than that dryer. It speeds up drying IMMENSELY from a regular hair dryer and the high and low feature was helpful as my Pomeranian will tolerate me doing her chest and neck on the low speed. I would recommend this."
4,Love this blower,I have two Kuvasz (male at 150 and female at 80) so you can imagine the amount of hair that needs to be dried after a bath. This cuts down on the time it takes tremendously. Also works great for blowing out the undercoat so there isn't as much hair drifting around in the house. Only negative I would say is I wish the temperature of the hair was a little warmer.
5,Great blower,"I am very happy with this product. It has 2 speed settings which is nice to acclimate the dog to the sound/force. The lower setting does take longer to dry the dog, but for dogs with less undercoat (or are nervous) this setting is fine.The air comes out cool, and warms a bit over time. The true ""drying"" comes from blowing the water off the dog. I use this for dog shows and after normal baths and I am very happy with the results. I have a medium coated dog with a dense undercoat and it takes about 15 minutes to dry out my dog's coat which usually takes hours to air dry or 45+ min with a hair dryer. My dog has even learned to enjoy this time. He will lean into the air when it hits ""the spot""."
5,Show Dog Aid,"This dryer is a must for a double coated breed like a Belgian Tervuren. After a bath, the dryer drastically cuts the time the dog must spend on the grooming table. It is also very portable to take to show sites.It does a terrific job of fluffing up the coat before showing. It can even make a naked dog who is out of coat look good!"
5,Happy Happy Happy!,Cut our drying time in half. Love the added productivity! I would suggest this for all shop owners or just pet owners in general.
4,MUCH quieter than the Master Blaster,"We use the Metro Master Blaster (4HP) at my salon, and they are very powerful. This dryer seemed very powerful when I tried it on my skin with the cone condenser-it seemed every bit as powerful if not more than the Master Blaster. However when I dried a thick-coated golden with it, it felt a little less powerful, BUT, it still dried her in probably the same about of time as it would have taken with the Master Blaster. Best part: WAY more QUIET. Much quieter than the Master Blaster. It's about the equivalent to a vacuum cleaner. Over-all, very satisfied. The brush attachment and the flat attachment are pretty much worthless though. I love how much more quiet this one is."
4,My daughter loves it,Nice software package and good for my little one's pre-school learning. She likes all of the different games that she can play. It seems like this software is aiding her in her learning quite nicely.
5,The shooting script to the ultimate war,"The shooting script of WAR OF THE WORLDS based on H.G. Wells' classic science fiction tale will also attract specialty movie-going fans, with a screenplay by Josh Friedman and David Koepp paired with a centerfold of color photos from the film. Wells's novel was a radio show, a movie, and even a rock musical: the shooting script book includes its screenplay, an introduction by screenwriter David Koepp, and more."
1,Expensive price for a WAY cheapo,I bought this recorder five months ago. I liked at first because also worked with my Polish PAL dvds until 1 day after the three months LIMITED warranty expired. A day after the expired warranty I noticed that it started to freeze up. The next thing i see a smoke coming out of the back of the unit coming from the actual power supply. Be aware of what you get.
3,It doesn't fit all cars.,"The product description said that the rack would fit most cars. Unfortunely, it didn't fit my Honda Accord. I suggest checking the manufactur's specs before purchasing."
5,Perfect product...!,"First time buyer..first time user of Bike Mount Rack. Purchased two months ago after reading many reviews and comparing many products on price/ quality ratio. Was very skeptical about mounting arrangement, but Very pleased with easy (less than 2 minutes) installation technique.....Gald that I bought this product."
5,easy and it works!,This rack is easy to install and easy to use. i put two Giant Cruiser adult bikes and one kids bike and it all fit and held up perfectly. I just ordered another one for my daughter that is in college so she can carry her bike home when she comes for summer vacation.
4,Good rack,Pro: This rack is more stable than the earlier one. I can make it fit any car.Con: The main buckle is made from plastic. I hope it will last. The earlier one was metal.
4,Fine for inexpensive bikes on a car you aren't worried about,"This rack does a fine job in safely transporting bikes as long as they are full sized and have a top tube. It will do 3 with no problems, as long as you stop frequently (about every 30 minutes or 30 miles) to tighten all the straps. The problem is that with only four straps the whole assembly does move on the car, causing cosmetic damage. The more expensive racks like the ones from Thule, Yakima, and Saris, attach more firmly to the car. A combination of rack design, additional straps, and straps that stretch less and stay tighter make the difference in this area. As for the bikes, there is nothing in this system to keep the bikes away from each other. Your paint will get chipped. Before you buy this, look at the more expensive racks and decide for yourself if your bikes and car warrant a better system. If not, the F1B is a good choice."
3,Does the job but very shaky,"Its a useful tool to carry your bikes. Seems to hold everything well. It is however very shaky. You are always concerned about the bikes falling off as you make turns (even though they don't). After 2 months, decided to keep it as a backup and get a more solid rack connected to the towing hitch."
4,Good for the money :),"We purchased this bike rack because of the raving reviews for it and the fact that the only BAD reviews said that this didn't fit their car. My husband and I have a Subaru WRX, and despite the fact that the directions said it wouldn't fit his hatchback....we tried it anyway and didn't have a single problem making it fit and keeping it secure. We drove through rush hour traffic and through a few backroads and it stayed totally secure, not to mention it didn't scratch the paint or anything. It DID take a little creative maneuvering to get all of the ties secured around our two bikes (seeing as this doesn't have any added secures for the bikes besides the ties that dangle off the rack), but once we did the bikes didn't move around at all.We both highly recommend this bike rack :)"
2,No way 3 bikes,"I recently ordered this rack to load up 3 bikes so our family could ride some local trails. It arrived in the time frame given and it was in good shape. It set up well and seemed sturdy. However, there is no way on Earth that this rack would hold all 3 of our bikes. I'm not sure how they can advertise this item as being able to carry three bikes. It fit 2 just fine but anyone thinking about buying this for 3 I would recommend looking elsewhere. I am currently attempting to contact the vendor concerning it's return policy and will update this review with that information."
3,Almost met my expectations,"I like the product but I really thought it would be able perform as advertised. It is ok to carry two bikes but it was advertised for three and I am sorry, that just won't happen. THe buckles on the two small straps became unusable after the the third time using them and I had to get some more straps to replace them."
2,Didn't work for me,"Doesn't work well with my Nissan quest, might be best for a car. In the description they say it works with mini vans, but It doesn't work for me. The straps are too short for a van, so the bottom part is not resting on the bumper to prevent it from shifting."
1,bike rack,The bike rack would not work on my year vehicle. I did not know that until I received it and looked at the direction to install it. It would fit other years of my vehicle but not 2008 Toyota Highlander
3,Doesn't hold 3 bikes,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I couldn't get 3 bikes on the rack. Tried all different positions. Trying to get one adult bike & 2 kids bikes on. Kind of disappointed because that's what I bought it for. I will say that it is very easy to install on the car"
4,Easy to use,"I don't see how you would possibly fit 3 bikes on this rack. I could only get 2 adult sized bikes on it. Also, be careful of the metal latch that can be moved in the 3 positions. If you have the rack hooked up to your car make sure when it is in the horizontal position that the metal piece is not touching your car. I scratched my new car on the trunk from not being more careful. I think this product is good for someone looking to put 2 bikes on it. I do like how easy it is to assemble and store."
5,Best Bike Rack I Could Find For My Hatchback,"This rack wasn't meant to fit on my Subaru Impreza hatchback, but with four, 14-inch bungee cords, I made it work. There was no worry about the two bikes coming loose, as I traveled over 1200 miles at speeds up to 85mph. No damage to my car either. Great product!"
3,Rattles,"I picked up another Dragonfly to replace the one I overtightened. This one isn't quite the same as my old one, though. I think Duncan lightened it up a bit, which is probably an improvement, but the one I got has this annoying rattle noise whenever it's sleeping. Maybe it should have been called the Rattlesnake?"
4,A decent multi,"I would have preferred double the amounts of Vitamin C, D, and E, and B6. It also contains a bunch of unusual vitamins like Saw Palmetto, Pumpkin Seed, and Oyster Extract that are supposed to specifically help men with problems like hair loss and reduced libido. I don't know if they work or not but I'm glad to take them anyway. This vitamin also contains no iron, which makes it especially good for men and seniors (they are warned about consuming too much).Due to the very high levels of these vitamins your urine will be bright yellow after taking it until the excess is flushed out."
5,A Serious Mouse Toy,"I had an old leather mouse toy from a late cat of mine that I had saved. When I finally got another cat, he chose it out of the others, and played with it constantly. He is a great hider and eventually we 'lost' the mouse (later found stuffed in the back of a non-digital audio speaker). Anyways, I searched for a long time to find an equivilent and this is it. Its made of real suede and can take a lot of punishment. My cat loves to grab it between its front paws, while raking it with his back claws, and finishes it with a good bite to the head at least a dozen times a day. He probably wonders why that mouse won't go away? Anyways, it takes a heck of a lot of abuse, and its texture seems to delight my cat to no end."
4,"Elegant Look, Bright Clean Sound","After a lot of browsing around for a bookshelf iPod system, I chose the Iyiyi and really, really like it.I found that I could easily adjust and fix sound issues via my iPod's EQ settings. Initially my bass was a bit distorted, but a few adjustments on the iPod itself made this Tivoli unit sound bright, full, and crisp. I know some people prefer the sound on the Bose SoundDock, but I have to wonder if they might have changed their mind if they had used the Iyiyi and just made some changes on their player--for me it just took five minutes of tinkering and listening. To each his own, I guess."
4,"Great package, except for cradle","Sound-wise this system delivers. The iPod cradle is not compatible with my 2nd generation Touch. It will play, but not charge. This was a disappoint. At that time customer support advised of an additional 3rd party purchase ( $40-50) that would provide that functionality.I already had the hardware that enables both an audio connection using the headphone output on the Touch and charging. This allows me to play music and read with an ereader app. Would not be able to do that using the dock, so the issue faded for me.It does say in the manuel something about not being compatible with later iPod models. This is not easily perceived from the website( at least for me).I own two other Tivoli radios and was pleased with their performance and sound. This system matches that part of my expectation, excluding the cradle. I view that more of a reflection of the Apple progression and the drumbeat of technology change."
2,no snooze!,"very solid and unique construction and design, but no snooze on the alarm!fortunately the return process through amazon was very easy."
2,"oh man... rehashed with a ""new"" twist","hate to say it, but this album pretty much sucks!! you should not tread on classics. the problem is that these songs did not age well.. terrible lyrics aside, this singer tries too hard to spruce up these songs. very easy stuff to play and very blahh! the saving grace in exciter was always dan beehlers screaching voice. thats what added some energy. but without him, this is seen for what it really is...crap...sorry guys, used to love these songs, but i think the bad production on the early releases may have helped! and the fact that the band is empty in terms of new material is sad... think its finally time to hang it up john ricci! it was never that great to begin with. the goal should be to GROW!!! pass...PS- 2 stars is because of the memories... not this..."
4,Just the beginning...,"Exciter's current line-up has been stabilized with this current studio effort! The album brings a fresh and modern sound to a mix of thrash-metal classics! Without a doubt these hidden treasures should be exposed to the metal fans at large. This album is only the beginning, and I look forward to Exciter's next full length studio effort. Long Live The Loud!!!!"
2,"Cheap, lousy earpiece","Like all Plantronics products, this will break soon enough. Too bad they have the monopoly on cordless headsets. There's often a buzz or crackle in the reception and the supplied earpiece was so painful and impossible to hear on that I had to drop $30 for a different over the headset."
4,PLANTRONICS CT11 W/MX150 HEADSET,"I LOVE IT! I AM ABLE TO WEAR IT AND ACTUALLY IT IS SO SMALL I FORGET I AM WEARING IT! THE CLARITY IS GREAT, IT IS EASY TO USE AND THE EAR PIECE IS COMFY....I LOVE IT! CHEERS TO AMAZON FOR THE SPEEDY SERVICE, I WASN'T EXPECTING IT FOR ANOTHER WEEK AND A HALF. GOT IT IN JUST A FEW DAYS!! WOW!"
5,A necessity for a mother of 3 (4 yrs old and under),This phone is a definite NEED for a busy mom with 3 kids and a daycare. I'm always doing things with my hands (multi-tasking) and without this phone I couldn't do it before. I love it. It works very well and I'm not sure how I lived without it before. Recommend to all multi-taskers!
4,Good Phone,"This phone is an excellant value, and the small size is great to tuck into your pocket. Reception is clear. The big drawback is the belt-clip....it is so poorly designed as to be useless. The clip simply does NOT hold the phone in place if you doing anything more than sitting."
4,"Not great, but pretty good for the money.","Ok, the buttons are a little small. Aside from that, this phone has worked great for me. I have a home office, and spend a good deal of time on the phone. This allows me to move anywhere in the house - with my hands free - and talk to my clients. I have a wireless network - no problems with interference there. I've dropped it on the hardwood floors a couple of times, and it keeps on working fine. I have no problems with the volume and I've asked people on the other end about the sound ... they say it is fine. Very happy with this phone."
4,Plantronics Cordless Phone,"This is my second Plantronics CT11 Cordless Phone. The first one I had I broke the ear piece. It works well,even after I have dropped it about 10 times. The earpiece has a shortlife span - you may have to replace it after 6 months to 1 year. Otherwise its a great, sturdy phone !"
1,its ok i guess,The headphones are not loud enough...could be amplified. There is no hold button. The buttons are too small.... Its just an ok phone . If asked if I would buy it again I would say Heck NO
1,When Stupid People Get Book Deals.,"Wow. I never thought I'd get a chance to write a negative review of a book, because my ability to pick personal winners has served me so well in the past. However, I caught this hardcover on sale and now I know why it was so cheap: it's terrible.The format is basic: a dilemma, one or more tips, and a solution. Some of these dilemmas are so obvious that you wonder if the 'smart people' in the title is just a trap for large egos.The tips are likewise obvious and of little help, but the maddening solutions cement my opinion. There is nothing written about how the solution actually worked in reality, so the reader is left to wonder if the dopey tips or solutions were of any use or not.If I wrote this, I'd be embarassed. In fact, I'm embarassed about reading it, but since it's now part of the bathroom reading material (no more perfect venue than that), it makes for a good laugh or two."
4,MOTOWN 1970s - Vol. 2,"I specifically purchased this CD because the long version of Stoned Love, by the Supremes, is on it, and I had been searching for it for many years! It's my favorite song on the CD. To the person searching for the long version of Stoned Love, you'll find it on this CD."
4,Brings Back Memories,This is a fun album (guess that dates me). Many of the songs you hear today are featured on commercials and in movies. Young kids these days don't know these artists. Rick James is awesome. Too bad such talent was wasted on negative means. This is one of his classics. Much better than SuperFreak.And Rare Earth's song just makes you want to get up and rejoice!
2,"Par for Miller, DQ for the Editor and Publisher","Miller rates a par for the book (if that's damning by faint praise, so be it) but the ghost writer, editor, and publisher should get a DQ (disqualified) for the effort. The misprints, factual errors, bad grammar, and typos detract to the point of cancelling out anything good Miller says. I wanted to like this book because Miller himself is so likeable and his TV commentary is so good,but thanks to the poor production value it's as hard to enjoy as a triple bogey. For instance,two questions: did Seve win three times on the PGA tour(pg 202)or six times(pg 203)? And how do you hit a ball with the clubshaft perpendicular to the ground? To do that, it would have to be dangling from your hands like a plumb bob. Maybe Johnny can demonstrate that during the rain delay at the British Open."
3,What Was He Thinking?,"Johnny Miller believes he knows everything about golf, and he also believes America needs to hear it. These are not particularly endearing traits, but in the world of television sports, where commentary is one part ass kissing and two parts statistics, Miller represents a breath of fresh air as much as hot air. Hold your nose and read the book. Much of it stinks but some of it is right on the money, the kind of antedote one needs after watching three hours of agonized putting and smarmy celebration of clunky wedge shots as ""good plays."""
5,"INSPIRATIONAL, MOTIVATING, HELPFUL!","Jason's book covers the ""how to's"" in becoming successful-- It starts with YOU! I have not yet finished the book, but am taking my time, writing notes, and thoroughly enjoying his writing style and the message therein.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to take steps toward reaching their goals."
5,Full Speed Ahead.,To much to say about this Man and his Music.....I am lifted to a Higher Spirit listnin' to this ....
2,J.Lo Love Dont Cost A Thing Import,"This cd has 3 tracks, plus one enhanced video, not the video version of the song! 1)love dont cost a thing 3:42 2)love dont cost a thing (full intention remix)7:15 3)on the 6 megamix- if you had my love,waiting for tonight,lets get loud 6:30 4)Video(enhanced) The on the 6 megamix is okay, its just the same songs on her album its just a jump mix basically. Track 2 is on her other us release of love dont cost a thing and it also doesnt have the video version of the song! I wouldnt buy it, but if you were to buy this cd, buy the us release version of it. For the same amount of money i say the us release version is alot better and more songs too!"
1,awful,please dont ever buy this awful single from this cheesy babe with no talent at all.avoid.get any cd from bob dylan instead.
5,fun 4 all,"Bucket Blast is so much fun. My husband and I had a blast playing one of the games with the kids. There are different games that can be played with this one game, so kids don't become bored with it easily. There are games that can be played inside and outside. We've really enjoyed Bucket Blast"
5,BRAHO FOR STARTERS,"I've been a very good fan of these guys ever since they first came out in the early 90's. Their music is so smooth and sweet,I'd recommend this album to the people who love romantic music...You'll love it"
5,If you want to make great chowder...,"You are reading this review because you are interested in making chowder and be advised that this is THE book on chowder. Everything you need to know and so much more is contained with the pages. Pick it up, read it and follow Jasper White's advise and you will be making great chowders in no time at all. The Lobster and Corn Chowder recipe is worth the price of the book.Enjoy!"
3,Just an Okay Book with Few Photos,"I found the book to have some odd recipes that were not really relevant. The classic Bahamian Conch Chowder, New England Lobster chowder, etc. were nothing new, but the recipies seemed to be authentic. I actually tore out 7 recipes, kept them, and threw the book away. The vendor was fine, the shipment came very quickly."
5,24 Hour Woman,"A fabulous movie that I have watched again and again, and one that I enthusiastically recommend to all my friends! I laughed so hard so often and then was moved to tears at the same time.It truly was like reliving my own experience as a new mother and ""career woman."" It is the only movie I have ever seen on this topic that is realistic!!! It is a movie that all new moms and dads should be REQUIRED to watch because it shows it like it is.By the way, does Leonard Maltin have kids? If so, I bet he behaved just like the husband in this movie, and just didn't get it! I often say that in my next lifetime I'd like to come back as the husband so I can pat myself on the back for ""helping.!"
4,good one.,"fun movie. Highly reccomended for a working woman family. Try and watch it with your loved one. Not worth 106 bucks, better to wait for the price to fall."
2,A First Class Computer,"As other reviewers have stated, the hardware itself is great. The computer is visually stunning. And the OS is rock-solid and user-friendly.Some people have complained about the size for traveling. It's about as small as a 17"" computer could be -- but if you are sitting in coach and the person in front of you reclines their seat, it's hard to use. (Get the 12"" if you think this might be a problem for you.)Finally, a word on Apple service. I had some problems with this computer and needed to send it back to Apple several times -- which is a bad thing. On the other hand, I finally reached Roberto, a Powerbook specialist in AppleCare, who was understanding and expedited my repair -- which is a good thing. 4-stars -- would have been 5-stars except for the hardware problems."
2,Horrible Track Listing..,"This was supposed to be a best of...it was not...not even close. I have never seen such a horrible track listing for a Best of, for any artist. Avoid at all costs. Nice booklet though. The music is great..but there was sooooooooo many other tunes that surely would be considered classics. THis ain't it.So 5 stars for music, 2 stars for tracklisting.And Michael's stuff seems so out of place here."
5,One of the best GBC racing games out there!,"Controls are easy to use and precise, graphics are very good. Instant access to all cars and tracks, no need to ""unlock"" every g.d. feature by winning every race with the worst vehicle first like so many other racing games. Simple, straight-forward menu interface. Turn it on, hit the ""A"" button three or four times, and you're driving! Tournament and multi-player modes mean you won't be putting it on the shelf after a couple of weeks. If you want to race on GBC, buy this game!"
5,Great product!!!!,This is a great product that was well worth the money. My daughter loves to be swaddled and is happy when I swaddle her each night before going to bed. She is two months old and sleeps for 9-10 hours a night without waking up. I attribute it to the Miracle Blanket. This blanket keeps your baby swaddled and helps them to have a good night sleep...and you too!! I would recommend it to any new or 2nd time parent.
4,Big on a newborn,"I like this swaddler. It is made of very soft and lightweight cotton.It helped the baby sleep good in the first month but I couldnt use it after that as my baby didnt want to be swaddled after the first month.However it runs a little big especially the pocket for feet. Other than that, a good product, a little pricey though, cheaper substitutes would work as well."
3,Swaddling Blanket,This blanket is a great idea but it wasn't as good as I was hoping for my baby. It is made of nice 100% cotton and is quite thin - this is good for all temperatures. I find it very fiddly to wrap the baby and there are often wrinkles underneath her which I think might be uncomfortable. Also when I left my baby up to get the wraps underneath her she often spits-up. Despite continued use my baby didn't seem to really like it and now I've given up using it and don't swaddle her at all. If your baby likes being swaddled though it is much more effective than just using a regular blanket to swaddle as the baby just cannot wriggle out of it.
5,Great swaddle if you want to control baby's hands,"This is the only swaddle blanket that we have managed to utilize thus far because our little one has a tendency to take his arms out of all the others. It's impossible to remove his arms and hands from this swaddle and once he is wrapped up and cozy, he loves it!"
2,My daughter had to have this,I don't know why but it was one of the most important things she wanted for her 4th birthday. The side broke off right away. It still works though. She barelly uses it now.
3,Less content than I expected,This book sounded fabulous from the other reviews. I was looking for a slim book with lots to say about the subject. I liked what the author had to say and her general approach to helping girls with menarche. This book has many blank pages for journalling. So many that I returned it. It was not right for my daughter but might be right for yours.
1,Horrible Film. What A Piece Of ImMorrla Garbage,"I rented this at our local video store thinking it would be good because it had Don Knotts in it. But it wasn't good at all.The Movie was pure garbage vulgar, Immoral, not a family film. Not even an Adult Film. This was an immoral piece of garbage. I mean who wants to see such a vulgar film that is full on ideas about evil things.Pile Of Garbage.Save your money and buy one of the other 4 Don Knotts comedy Classics Instead!"
4,Funny Family Entertainment,"Although not quite as good as some of his other movies such as The Reluctant Astronaut or The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, this is still a very funny classic Don Knotts movie."
5,Very Underrated Don Knotts Movie!!,"The Don Knotts Movie""The Love God"" had just a tinge of naughtiness in it compared to his other movies which were more family orientated and surprised many but otherwise Don Knotts acted brilliantly at his best.It's a very underrated,must see Movie!!"
5,Great Period Comedy,"Easily Don Knotts' greatest vehicle (not saying much, unfortunately) - a rich script, colorfully tacky sets and cinematography, ""timely"" subject matter, and a hilarious performance from Knotts that will surprise anyone uncertain of his ability to pick films worthy of his talent. This was Don Knotts' only foray into ""adult"" comedy, and it is rather racy, all things considered, and compares favorably to the 1950s Tashlin and Jerry Lewis films."
2,Dumb movie,I love Don Knotts but this movie was just pain stupid. It was corny and the plot was very weak
2,"Wrong direction, Don","This film is an odd mixture of a typical Don Knotts movie and a satire of the Hugh Hefner Playboy magazine/lifestyle. It does have some laugh out loud moments. Don stays ""pure"" thru-out. But there are many lascivious going-ons around him that somehow degrade his normally very innocent approach. Apparently at the time this film was turned down by many theatres, whose owners knew their core audiences would reject this offering."
1,"I saw this movie, but I'm not sure what I saw.","This is quite an odd movie, and what makes it weirder is its premise. A pornographer lost his mailing license, so he buys up Don Knotts' failing magazine, and being publishing his rag under the name of Don Knotts's paper. Knotts, who has been in Brazil bird watching, comes back and gets mistaken for a wild playboy, and gets alienated from his small town heart-of-gold girlfriend.So this is like a cross between ""The People vs. Larry Flint"" and ""A Face In The Crowd,"" but with the twitchy Don Knotts trying to pass himself off as a n Austin Powers type of swinger.This is quite an odd film, and it dragged and sagged in many areas. It has a lot of interesting secondary characters, and a very contrived ending. This film is listed as PG-13, even though it was released in 1969, so I am not sure of the original rating, since PG-13 was invented in 1984 after people got mad at ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."""
1,save your money,"Too bad there isn't a no star option here. Edna Barz lived through a lot in World War II: unfortunately she's not able to communicate it on paper. I get the idea someone said those fatal words -- ""So, Edna, your stories are so interesting. You should write a book"" -- once too often. All women are described as either ""great gals"" or ""old bags"" and a number of people simply disappear, evidently not at hands of the enemy. Although the subject matter is compelling, the writing is flat and devoid of both interest and skill. Alas."
2,Powerful story that takes a sinister detour...,"The writing and multi-viewpoint structure of the book are very good--HOWEVER: In the later sections of the book, the author begins to suggest two things: (1) the sexual molestation wasn't really that bad for the boy, and (2) ""society"" and ""the courts"" really caused the boy's trauma by telling him that being ""touched"" was bad. These two tenets come straight from NAMBLA, the society of boy-molesters. I don't know if it was the author's intention, but this book appears to endorse the ""blame-the-victim"" strategy that is so often used against women who have been raped. Finally, I wasn't sure whether the author wanted me to feel sorry for the perpetrator, when he died in prison. I didn't."
5,"An Honest, Compelling and Emotionally Charged Read","Touched is without a doubt the best book I have read this year. The honest manner in which Campbell relates a disconcerting story makes it a brave and compelling page turner. His ability to write the thoughts of a woman is brilliantly astute(like Lamb, but better). The plot had me totally engrossed from page one.The novel is insightfully psychological in a completly non-pretentious manner that will move and touch you. Told in four parts, from four perspectives, I believe that everyone will find something in this novel that they can identify with. Overall, a perfectly wonderful and highly recommended read."
3,Arena rock anthems galore,"707 may have been a blip on the AOR radar screen twenty years ago, but this recently uncovered live performance from back in the day shows that the group clearly had what it takes to stand side-by-side with their rock peers. 707 delivers arena rock anthems galore with this un-dubbed, unedited, in-the-raw live performance. The quality sounds a little dated, but comparable to the bootleg tapes you used to make at their shows."
4,this dude is the bomb.,snowballing yet precise rhythms... how do these guys lay it down so fast without total loss of control? they probably juggle dangerous objects to warm up and cool down. do yourself a favor and purchase this work. I give it 4 stars because I consider 5 stars unattainable (unless we're talking barber's adadgio for strings or Shostakovich's symphony no. 8.)you want some roadtrip music?I said do yourself a favor and purchase!mmmmm-mmmmm-mm.
4,tasteful and informative,"I could do without the slightly cheesy background music. But other than that, there is nothing to complain about. It is done tastefully (definitely not pornographic) which makes it easy to watch. Instead of kama-sutra books, this video allows you to see exactly how each position is formed and kept. The commentaries are useful to explain what to expect with each position, as far as sensation and difficulties."
3,OK but not as good as expected,Actually 3 stars but somehow sterile as penetration is not really shown (this is an anudt DVD) or genitals and I don't mean to show the way they do in XXX movies. Otherwise this is well done. I have glasses of my own so it was a liitle difficult to use 3D glasses but the 2D version is fine. So if you don't like seeing everything this is for you as the positions are inspriring and couples are good looking.
5,good.......,"Kama Sutra - Secrets to the Art of LoveVisual and Everything good... But the Blue/red glasses are not good.After useing a good glass, i got the good result."
4,One of the creepiest of the series,"June Havoc is fantastic as she and her husband (Eddie Albert) fend off animated tumbleweeds, a frog attack and malevolent boulders in a creepy farm inhabited by an equally creepy farmer (Arthur Hunnicut). The crisp dialogue and uncomfortable sense of confused tension make this a memorable episode"
2,"And I thought ""Tourist Attraction"" was bad!","""Cry of Silence"", along with the one in the above title, has to rank as one of the worst episodes in the two-year history of the landmark series.Maybe star Eddie Albert was getting prepared for the ""absurdities"" that he would encounter on his television series ""Green Acres"".Only the inhabitants of the fictitious town of Hooterville would believe menacing tumbleweeds."
5,Great Price for hard to find items.,The price was right and shipped to us in a timely matter. Could not find these from the big office store retailers.
2,My Opinion,I was very disappointed in this book. It was not current enough and much of the information was older and not as relevant as I had hoped.
4,Cute...,The toy arrived on time. The material is good and nice. Its perfect pair for my other teddy. A good add-up to my collection.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Wow, please please please let me help you save your money.This was given to me as a gift and I threw it away the next day. I sat there looking at this odd device trying to figure how in the heck this should make my life easier....or cleaner...it doesn't.So instead of grabbing a mess with a plastic bag or paper towel and being done with it....you use this. Let me tell you how this goes...You pull a bag out too far and then wrap it around the end, slide it under the pile of poop, and press the magic button. Now you have just gone from one isolated pile of kitty's last night dinner to a smeared mess all over the floor, the outside of the bag, and all over the 'grabber'.When you first see this thing in action, you will laugh pretty hard at what an utter failure of a device and idea this item is.Please, save your money!"
1,Don't bother,This product is a piece of crap. It didn't pick up much and it's too much of a hasstle to pull out everytime you want to clean up a mess.
1,Junk! Don't waste your money,"This thing is pure junk. I should have figured that out by the $4.00 I paid. Do yourself a favor and buy a bag of chips and a soda, you'll be better off."
3,Works OK but not very useful,I bought this to use it as a pooper scooper for my dog. It takes a bit to manipulate it to work as directed but is just not worth the hassle of setting it up and carrying it around. Easier to just carry the bags and pick it up with your hand!
5,Easy cleanup,I bought the Wet Dry Power Scooper because it was on close-out and very inexpensive. It is well worth it. I have 8 cats and it cleans up their hairball messes with ease instead of grounding it into the carpet. I am looking for additional bags because I definitely do not want to run out.
1,Even at $5 -- bad deal,"I saw this thing and thought to myself, ""$5? Sure I'll gamble that on something that might make scooping easier."" I lost that bet.And I have NOT even tested this thing. Because just from looking at it, I know it will only make the mess worse instead of better. All this will do is smear a mess around, maybe pull in a little bit of it... but them probably splurt that little bit back out like toothpaste sqeezing out of a tube.And I've tried to imagine some kind of alternate use for this thing... It might make a interesting toy for an especially dumb child, maybe?The upside is it came with a roll of baggies and those are almost worth $5. They're far more effective without the unit."
3,It's ok I guess...,I know. You are probably thinking a sequel to Secret of Mana. Well.... This game doesn't hold a candle to the Secret of Mana. Don't get me wrong it doesn't suck that bad. It just really isn't that great of a game.
2,This is why they cancled Secret of Mana 2?,"I have to say, I'm not impressed. I would have much rather have gotten Secret of Mana 2 rather than this. Not recomended."
1,Not up to Square's Quality.....,"Secret of Evermore is a beginner game. I spent of most my time Powering up weapons and the alchemy spells which you aquire. It's really bad. I am an Avid player of Squares w/ Final Fantasies, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Vagrant Story, Parasite Eve, etc....And My final Conclusion of this game is that -- it was put together in a hurry. It's that bad."
2,Beyond intermediate.,"I've taken 2 years of college Russian and consider myself fairly knowledgable, but this book is a bit beyond my abilities. The passages in the text are often crammed full of new vocab to learn and in between lessons is more grammer. The book does give you a huge insight to Russian culture, but it's not that great if you want to learn the language itself. I wish there was another text like the Nachalo series."
1,Poorly written...next time hire a fact checker,"Although I feel sorry for the author being shot with no chance to defend himself, the bulk of this book is a polemic attack on the firearms industry. Now that's to be expected from a typical NYer and a victim, but what is most troubling about the book is the factual inaccuracies, particularly about the history of firearms development in the US. The author tries to smear arms manufacturers as racists and incorrectly draws parallels to Nazi Germany. Next time hire a fact checker and maybe even someone with a mere high school education will take this book halfway serious."
1,Suggest you wait a bit...,"The Supreme Court will be providing an ""interpretation"" of the second amendment by the end of June, 2008. You might want to wait 'till after that to get this book, given the tenuous nature of its arguments."
5,five stars given by 12 year old boy,"People should play this game because it is super fast and awesome. It takes a ton of brain power and it's fun to think of words. Kids will love it, especially when they win against their mom! - BenI love that this keeps me on my toes. I really have to think when playing against my son. Also, it allows me to help him learn to spell words. He thinks of lots of words but many times doesn't know how to spell them. - mom"
4,Fun game that makes you think too!,Our family likes this game very much. It's a fast moving game which makes the players be creative with words. It's challenging enough to be interesting and fast enough to keep everyone involved.
4,"Fun, quick game - good to build vocabulary",Fun - easy to adjust the rules for adults so that they can play with kids and all enjoy it. Good for 10 years +. Love the speed of the game. A great game.
1,Never buy an Atkins Book,"Dr. Atkins, I use Dr. loosely, should stop writing books. He assume the reader knows to much. Also, Dr. Atkins should stay in his own realm of chemistry, Physical chemistry and not try to intrude into other areas. Avoid this book like the plague. Atkins writes only to write them and get a fat check. The content is sub-par."
5,Great Classic Film Score! (Ignore Movie Behind The Curtain.),"This is one those situations (not uncommon nowadays) where thefilm score lives on, but the film under goes an early demise.Messers. John Morgan and William Stromberg have once againcreated and presented film music in the classical sense--a scorethat is more a symphony than, well, just another copy-cat,contemporary film-music hack composition. It's cool, startling,riviting, and end-to-end totally enjoyable. Just like filmscores used to be! And likely to end up being a collector's itemsoon.William Flanigan, Ph.D."
2,"Yawn, is it over yet?","C'mon now. Yes, neo-soul is on the rise, and I am a big fan of the movement. But Jaguar is not carrying her weight. I will say she is an amazing live singer, which made me buy the album. But when I listened to it, I couldn't even tell it was the same person. She seems to try and be so hard that her delivery doesn't sound as good as it could. The songs are monotonous, even the cameos by The Roots and Bilal couldn't save the day. Oh well, I guess Philly was due for at least one flop."
5,where is her promotion????,".... the cd is great. Yeah, she throws a few curse words in here and there when they aren't really necessary but i am FEELING Jaguar Wright. there isn't really a song on there that i don't like but my favorites are ""what ifs"", ""stay"", ""self-love"" and ""Same ..., Different day part 2"". and she does a great job on the Patti LaBelle remake of ""Love, need, and Want you"" People have been comparing her to Mary J. Blige and as much as i LOVE Mary, i think Ms. wright has a much better singing voice and much more soul. I haven't taken it out of my cd player yet and i haven't given an artist that much rotation since Jill Scott first came out."
5,Well Worth the listen,"Although Jaguar has been compared to ""neo-soul"" (I hate that label) artists like Jill Scott and Mary J. Blige, Jaguar's style of music is definitely set apart from her female counterparts. This singer/songwriter provides soulful lyrics that many listeners can relate to as well catchy beats that make you want to nod your head in time with the music.May this talent last long in the music business...I hope to hear even more of her future work."
3,It's aaaiiiight...,"I wasn't captivated by her cd upon first listen. Her vocals are tight, though. Very soulful. Especially on ""What If"" and ""Love, Need and Want You."" I heard some people had issues with her profanity but I didn't find that it overshadowed the entire project in a vulgar way. ""I Can't Wait"" sounds like they used a Prince sample from Sign 'O The Times, though it's not listed...somebody tell me I'm crazy.I liked the cd, but I can't say it would get crazy play like Musiq's Lauryn's or Erykah's did the first month of release. It just isn't exciting or different enough. Nothing on the cd really grabs you. It just kind of taps you on the shoulder. I look forward to her next project. But I think I might listen to a friend's copy first before I purchase my own."
2,4 the ghetto gurl in ya...,"If you're in the mood to curse somebody out or open up a can of whoop a#@, then this is the CD for you. It's the album to listen to you when you are trying to ""keep it real"". Once that mood passes, however, you are left with this CD. Unfortunately, I happened to be in the mood the day that bought this CD.I enjoy Jacguar's vocals but the music--regular cookie cutter R&B sounds will keep me interested for only so long. There are days when I have to put my game face on but eventually, I gotta let my guard down.Sista Jag, I'm going to have to catch you on the next album when MY mood is right."
4,I love this CD,"I think the Cd is excellent, there is not one song that I do not like, only thing I could do without is the language but even with that there isn't a lot of song with explicit language on it so it is tolerable.If you like the Philly sound that is out there now Musiq, Jill Scott, Bilal etc, plus the old R&B classics of Stevie, Prince and so fourth you will flip over this CD. If not you might not appreciate it as much but it is definately one to have in your CD player."
2,Just okay,"I first saw Jaguar Wright on Jay Z's Unplugged show and thought she was a star in the making. The subsequent hype made me eager to hear more. Unfortunately, this CD doesn't live up to the excitement. Jaguar is undoubtedly talented but her music would have been more effective without the cursing. I just don't think excessive swearing works in R&B especially.I have to say I found some unexpected hilarity in the most hostile CD/album liner notes I've ever read, but at the same time it made me sad. Wright has potential but there seem to be some, uh, ""issues."" Hopefully she reaches a level of maturity that's equal to her talent."
1,This Was A Mess!!,Thank goodness I purchased this CD used. It was horrible. I know that Jaguar Wright's voice is much better than this CD. That's why I'm so mad that she let this cat out of the bag.What's up with all the cursing? She's trying to be the Neo-Gangster of soul? I was very disappointed with this album. It was not a good look and I would definitely think twice before buying anything from her again. I don't recommend this CD to anyone.
3,A good addition to my collection (3.5),"THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE...........AT ALL! Jaguar has all of the qualities that the other reviewers are speaking on, BUT what's really different here but the name and some curse words? Look at it from my perspective: I already own Amel Larriuex, Badu, Jill Scott, Mary J., Arie, Res, Julie Dexter, Angie Stone, Alicia Keys, Davina, Jazzyfatnastees, Kelis, Laurnea, Lauryn Hill, Ledisi, Lina.....and the list continues. You take all of those CDs and wonderful music and then try to work Jaguar's CD into the rotation...... sorry but I couldn't.PLEASE DON'T GET ME WRONG, JAGUAR IS A BAD GIRL AND SHE HAS THE RIGHT PEOPLE BEHIND HER, JUST A LITTLE OF ""SOMETHING DIFFERENT"" WAS NEEDED.Favorite gems: ""I can't wait"", ""I Don't Know"", ""Same Sh!t Different Day"" (both version), ""Self Love"", and the too short track ""Stay"".oNe"
2,"Could have, should have been better! 2 THUMBS DOWN ,WAY DOWN","JAGUAR IS A VERY TALENTED WOMAN!! AND SHE WAS DEFINETLY TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE IN HER MUSIC. BUT WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE? THAT SHE CAN CURSE IN EVERY SENTANCE. MIND YOU, ERIKA BADU, FLOETRY, AND SEVERAL OTHER ARTIST HAVA SAID ""A"" CURSE WORD IN ONE OF THEIR SONGS. BUT GOOD LORD, NOT EVERYONE. WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS CD I LISTEN TO THE FIRST SONG ""WHAT IF"" AT FIRST I WAS FEALING BUT AS SOON AS SHE STARTED CUSING I WAS TURNED OFF. IT REALLY PREVENTS HER REAL TALENT FROM SHINGING THROUGH. AND IT'S NOT COOL. THE SONGS HAVE NICE BEATS AND FUNKY 70'S SOUND. BUT I HOPE ON THE NEXT ALBUM SHE TONES DOWNT THE CURSING. WAY DOWN. THERE IS ABSOLUTEYL NO REASON FOR IT. ESPECAILLY WHEN JAGUAR IS AS TALENTED AS SHE IS. LEAVE THE CURSING FOR THE LESS TALENTED."
4,Motivation,"A guy at my job turned me on to this CD. He actually burned me a copy of it after bragging about how talented she was. I loved it and played it out. It actually encouraged me to start listening to more Neo-Soul artist. She talks about more then just being in love, she talks about life and the drama that comes along with it. I also have Divorcing Neo to Marry Soul, get it dont sleep."
3,Not what I expected,I felt this cd didn't show all of Jaguar's talent. Someone with such a wonderful powerhouse voice should sings songs that reflect that. She has a lot of potential. Hopefully we'll see it on her next album.
4,Not bad at all..,"Jaguar Wright's album D,D & D is one helluva great album. Its worth a shot for your collection. I wish she had funkier, more upbeat stuff..she definitely has the vocals for it..and because of that she only reigns with 4 stars...to me at least."
4,The album doesn't do her live show justice...,"Jaguar Wright is quite a few steps above the average r&b singer ...If this was a live album, or if I wouldn't have seen her live before hearing the album, I would have given it 5+ stars. Many people complain about the cursing, but if you see her live, you understand. Especially with 'Ain't Nobody Playin'. She reminds me of a modern-day Millie Jackson. I saw her a few times live and both shows were AMAZING. Her background singers and band are even above average. ...'What If's', 'Country Song', Ain't Nobody Playin' and 'I Can't Wait' are my favorites. Her album are laced with beats that compliment her style. Jaguar Wright is going to be a force to be reckoned with when she gets regular radio airplay and a video into rotation. I think 'What If's' is going to be her first video. When it does, watch out!!!..."
4,Very EXPLICIT lyrics,"Sister Jaquar has a beautiful alto voice! With her on mic and The Roots providing the riffs...you can't miss with this cd. ""The What If"" - is tight and definitely one of the best cuts on the cd...this is overall a great cd I love her version of Patti's, ""Love You Need You Want You.""While the cd shows much promise of what to expect from this soulful artist, I just wonder can she deliver the same powerful messages without the profanities."
4,More for academics and research,It wasn't what I was expecting. This book is better used for research and academics on the impact of obesity in society and how discrimination against obesity is created and perpetuated. It is not intended to make you feel good about yourself but possibly to make you mad and revolt :)
1,Not compatible with Vista Operating System,"Plugged them in and no sound. Pause and forward menu buttons all work though. Searched online, followed forum advice and downloaded sp1 windows service pack and all usb updates. Still nothing. Called logitech customer support, non-toll free number by the way. Call lasted 65 minutes, only to find out that these speakers are not fully compatible with Vista operating systems...thanks for wasting my time. They should not say on the product requirements that it's compatible with XP and above operating systems."
3,Logitech Laptop Speakers,Good compact speakers that are easy to use. The sound quality is generally good unless you are listening to classical piano music where the volume has to be significantly reduced to avoid distortion.
2,Not Performing Reliably,"Bought these several years ago and I've had trouble with them from the start. When they work they're fine and much better than my laptop speakers, but I often have trouble making them work on my computer, even if I go into SOUNDS and change the OUTPUT to the Logitech speakers (which should happen automatically, I think). It's frustrating because I use them for work for presentations and they will decide not to work and then I'm stuck trying to get a room full of people to listen to my laptop speakers. I agree that the controls on top are pretty useless -- you cannot tell what they're doing. The sound is better than built in speakers, but not as full as you'd hope for speakers this size. I like the convenient case and the ability to separate speakers. Good idea, just not well executed. I'm looking for new ones that are more reliable."
2,great sound but does not work easily,"Had to send them back to logitech. half the time windows did not recognize the device, does not work with itunes (even the latest version), and the volume and mute controls never worked. Too bad because the sound and portability are great."
2,Bummer,I did a lot of research out here prior to ordering these speakers and most everyone had a favorable review. I purchased them in May with no problems and they worked great with my Dell laptop. In late July they quit producing sound...it appears they are working on my control panel but no sound comes from the speakers anymore and the mute button is not on. Unfortunately I am past my month return date so I am stuck with $50 speakers that don't work anymore.
1,Stopped working after 10 minutes,"Well they sounded great...for the 10 minutes that they worked.The sound cut out mid-song playback. Several hours of web surfing later, I see this is a problem that many users have had.My system successfully detects the speakers, the power is functional, the drivers are loaded, the sound routes to the speakers, and according to windows hardware testing playback is functional. However, sound is no longer coming out of the speakers. Other speakers and built in speaker are all functional.I will be returning these. Logitech customer support is weak. Disappointing, since the speakers sounded decent to my non-audiophile ears - for the 1.5 songs that they were able to play."
4,Great for presentations,"Whenever I do presentations I have in the past had to lug around speakers, cables and power supplies - these beauties comes in their own case and connect to the pc via USB, and get the sound signal and power via this cable - it doesn't get easier and great sound quality....."
4,Great Speakers for any laptop,"These speakers are a God-send for anyone looking to beef up their tiny and crappy notebook speakers. I carry them whenever I know im going to need my laptop for a couple of hours somewhere other than home.Very convenient case and no power requirements other than the USB is also great. Its recognized in almost all my different computers and laptops.The reason for a star being knocked off is the fact that turning up the volume all the way creates some weird static noises. Tune it down just a bit and it works great though, and these things are LOUD."
2,Does not work all the time,"This speaks worked on one of my laptop. It won't worked on the other one. When it worked, it sounds as it should be.I am trying to find out why this speakers failed on the other laptop."
4,Not bad,Pros: Great sound. Easy to use. Convenient case.Cons: You have to plug it in a few times before the computer recognizes it.
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased a set of Logitech's V20 speakers and for the first 3 weeks I owned them I thought they were great then they just quit working. I found if I removed and reinstalled the driver they would work for about 3 minutes then quit.The mute/un-mute works indicating that I am ""talking"" to the speakers but they do not reproduce any sound.Before you purchase these do a search using the keywords: ""Logitech V20 speakers not working"" and do some reading.Reading the Amazon reviews seem to indicate that not everyone is experiencing the same problem that I am, but, like I say, ""Buyer beware!""ERK"
2,"Despite great design, had to return due to not working for more than few minutes","I have a Vista x64 laptop. Although the design and features and even sound quality are good, the sound would abruptly stop after a few minutes of use. Unplugging and replugging into same or another USB port wouldn't work, neither would rebooting. Leaving the speakers unplugged overnight seemed to solve the problem, but the problem would recur within a few minutes of use the next day. After 2-3 days of this the speakers were returned."
2,Not very loud...,"I am about to but different speakers... These are okay until turned up. Then the crackling sets in. I have seen smaller, cheaper speakers do much more. For the price I desired a little more. :("
3,mobile usb speakers ironically not practically mobile,"pros: decent sound quality when it works, no extra power adapter or battery needed.cons: uses usb connection only, sometimes there are usb connection problems when you move the laptop around causing sound to drop out and the V20 audio device to disappear in windows.analysis: mobile speakers ironically not very useful in a mobile environmentif you just plug it into your laptop's usb and you don't move the laptop around, then you're good.but say if you're in your car and you want to use bettery quality speakers than your laptops built in speakers, the usb connection can be a problem as it may cut off causing you to have to restart the media player's application in order for sound to play back again. (unlike using headphone plugs, when moving your laptop around, you can't just unplug the usb and plug it back in)"
3,"Effective, but not mind boggling","These are pretty good speakers, but lacking in bass. Also, above a certain volume the sound is a little tinny and starts to crackle. For travel speakers, to use with a laptop, though, they work fine and are very compact and easy to transport."
3,logitech speakers,"Good sound for speech and movies ,however music is tinny sounding . Not adjustable there is no woofer for the bass .Easy install plug and play. expensive for the type of speaker though . sound level is hard to adjust because the buttons are so small . I would buy again because there is nothing on the market with the usb style of installation .laptops hhave very poor sound so we are forced to buy a louder sound system in order to hear anything clearly ."
4,Truly plug-n-play!,"Bought V20 and tried it on my Hp WIndows PC, Sony Laptop and Mac Mini. Systems recognize V20 almost instantly. Sound quality is above average comparing to other notebook speakers but is only ok comparing to most desktop speakers at the same price range. I particularly like the portability of V20. No bulky power brick to carry with."
5,Logitech Notebook Speakers,"This is a great little product. It has very nice sound and needs no additional power...just attach it to your laptop. The speakers are very compact and come in a very nice little travel case.I listen to a lot of music when I am away from my Desktop which has big speakers attached, and I find this little system quite satisfactory."
2,Lame,These are no where near the quality for the price. I had these for a month got frustrated and returned them for some Altec Lansing speakers which are GREAT!
5,Completely satisfied with Logitech V20 speakers,This purchase was cheap but the product was in perfect condition and shipped quickly. I would definitely reccommend this seller. No problems here.
2,Poor quality audio speakers,I bought these speakers looking at description given on Amazon. Sound quality is not at all great. I was looking for good sound and sleek shape. Size wise speakers are good also comes with nice packing however sound quality is like any other portable speakers available in the market..not at all great.
5,Tested with Tomita,"I like these speakers. I put on Pandoa radio with my Tomita station to give them a good testing. They passed with flying colors, except the bass end is a little tight. They would be excellent with a sub-woofer. Later I learned to ajust the tone on this speakers through the mixer, I boosted the bass and the result is very good. The bass is richer than before. No need for a sub-woofer now. I highly recommend these speakers."
