3,Heir To A Dream,This book showed a true life changing story about a great athlete and a man of Christ at the same time but was more for the more mature type reader i thought. But overall gave good amounts of information concerning the topics.
3,Decent Book,Worth a try if you want to learn more about Pete Maravich and his father and enjoy his transformation to Christ.
5,At Last On CD,"Ever since I retired my turntable a couple of years ago, I've been searching for ""Live At Last"" on CD. If you're a serious Rathead (like I was in the late '70's), or even if you've never HEARD of these guys, this live set recorded in 1979, I believe, at the old My Father's Place club in Old Roslyn, NY, captures the joy and energy of the best, most original (not to mention prolific) small-venue band I've ever seen (about 30 times, in fact; I was a groupie). The music on this CD is one of the things that made being a teenager on Long Island in the disco era tolerable. So when is ""Tasty"" coming out on CD?"
3,Cute....but did not work!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband as we both love Mario. The toy is very cute, but it does not do what it is supposed to do. In order for the food to flip in the pan, we have to push down on his arm to trigger the flip after winding it up. Not worth returning due to return shipping charges. It's cute if you just want to display it though."
3,Good book but not my first choice...,"This book is sweet and sour. It is good because it covers many different topics by some very knowledgable authors. But on the other hand, I found it difficult to read. With so many authors, the pace kept changing along with the style. Get this book if you have time to rehash. Otherwise pass over this one for ""Data Warehouse Project Managment""."
2,And yet another..,"And yet another disapointing self help depression book up on the shelves..Why can't the authors, instead of trying to cross over their in-house recovery programs to books, just get these therapies to us directly..I am so tired of writing lists of negative thoughts and behaviors and then thinking I'm gonna connect with this stuff and solve my own depression..It never works..Were only told that if we follow along and do the exercises, we'll be much closer to normal..SURE..Jeez, I hardly have the motivation to turn the page..This stuff needs to be taught and pushed first hand to people..Bring it on and stop trying to sell books that fizzle after the 1st 2 chapters.."
4,Classic Haemorrhage but seems too short,"I love the production on this album because it is a little low-fi but no so much that the music gets lost. This isn't new or innovative music at all but for fans of haemorrhage or early 90's Carcass you can't go wrong. I love the dual vocal style and the oftentimes groove laden way they play the music. There is no doubt about it, Haemorrhage have found a niche in the metal scene and they are the kings of early Carcass era gore grind so much that in some ways they have taken a tired theme and worked it into their own brand. I wouldn't say this is an essential metal album but if you like early Carcass then Anatomical Inferno is a great little album that will be enjoyed. The only bone I have to pick is it seems like it is too short for 14 songs. Had it been just a tad longer I would have given it 5 stars."
5,"Great book, just not if you live in certain states...","This book is great. It made me think about a lot of things, being unmarried to my live-in partner and having a young child. However, we are moving to Illinois soon, and this book does NOT apply to unmarried, heterosexual couples there. Illinois is one of a handful of states that has laws against cohabitation. If you live in Illinois or another state that still has these types of laws on the books, none of the legal documents that this book helps you prepare are going to hold up in court. I think it's great, however, that a book like this exists and is so detailed and helpful. Cohabitating couples, especially those of us who have children together and plan to buy homes or own property together, need to know the legal issues as individuals and as a couple. I highly recommend this book, though it probably isn't worth your time if your state still has the anti-cohabitation laws."
2,not thorough enough,"Each section starts with a form and then simply explains how to fill it out. The book does a good job of explaining things in clear language, but it does not go into great detail. There is a small section on durable power of attorney and health care directives but it does not include forms. The book points you to Quicken Lawyer Personal Deluxe for that. It deals with issues that might pertain to couples receiving social security and those with children and/or ex-spouses. But I don't think there is enough information for young ""DINKs"" (dual income, no kids)."
3,Basic,"Thought there would be a bit more specifics in this book. In my opinion it is very general. For instance, the section on how to arrange to split a mortgage interest deduction is not helpful at all. For some reason when I did a google search months ago, a quote from this book came up and impressed me and I bought the book. I should have really looked more closely at it. Focuses a lot on what to do with the kids."
5,great book for co-hab couples,"This book covers every possible situation and offers up various solutions for couples not willing (or able) to get married. Excellent way to build a foundation for a relationship that will last. Unfortunately money is still the biggest reason for ""break-ups"".... while no book can prevent problems, this book helps guide you around them. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,LEGAL DETAILS FOR UNMARRIED COUPLES,"Toni Ihara & Ralph WarnerThe Living Together Kit:A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples(Berkeley, CA: Nolo Press, 1997--8th Edition) about 250 pagesThis book is recommended for everyone who wants helpcreating legal agreements for non-married relationships.Get the most recent edition, which will include the latest changesin state and federal laws applicable to unmarried couples.Major chapters discuss: financial and practical sharing;renting; buying a house; having children; prior families;dividing property when separating; wills and estates.The book is well organized, discussing the issues one by one.The authors are two lawyers who lived together for 19 yearsand then decided to get married for the sake of their daughter.If you would like to discover other such books,search the Internet for the following exact words:""UNMARRIED COUPLES---RELATIONSHIP CONTRACTS---BEST BOOKS"".James Leonard Park, author of Designer Marriage: Write Your Own Relationship Contract."
4,worth watching,Really worth watching. Good story line. It really showed the sacrifices that people willing to do for freedom and country.
5,Worth the rent & the time,"This is an amazing movie. With deep, precise and gripping character development. But most of all it tells the story of the burden of command. How one man must lead, inspire, direct and morn the men in his command. How one unobtrusive, unremarkable man must dig deep, really deep, To become a commander, a killer and a legend. The structure and the nuances of the chemical makeup of the human brain were an unknown science in WWII. But today we know it as PTSD...when the human brain rewires itself to help the victim cope with the stresses of death, pain, mortal fear, loss of close companions and physical deprivation. But in WWII, it was known as ""real men"". Real Men like Max Manus. This movie is worth your time. See it today."
5,Max Manus: Man Of War,"Superior film. Dramatizes Max's two books very efficiently. The movie inspired me to read both books: they proved page-turners, and I felt as if I were in conversation with Max himself, that is the immediacy he creates even in his translated prose account."
4,Norwegian Resistance,"This movie is all about helping the King of Finland and the Finns beat the Nazis. More than the fight against the Nazis which I believe worked for this movie, it is the relationships of Max with his friends and co-workers that works when watching this movie. The scene after independence where he raises a toast for all the friends( who have died in the war) explains the relationships he had. Finland is beautiful country and it is depicted in the movie. A must watch for movie lovers. !!"
1,Cant Read BluRay,"Unfortunately, unable to play this Blu Ray in both my and my parents Blu Ray players. Upgrading the firmware on my player did not fix. Amazon was great and sent a replacement copy that arrived in a couple days. That copy also did not play in my Blu Ray player. Wondering if this Blu Ray is regionally encoded but the CS reps didnt think that was the problem.I really wish that Amazon would permit an n/a for ratings. I based my rating solely being unable to play the disk as a warning to other US customers. Shame was looking forward to it an I try and collect WW2 films..."
4,So Much I did not know,"A very interesting and exciting movie abut the Norwegian resistance during WWII focussing on Max Manus, the title character. It made me do more research about Norway during WWII. I recommend the movie and while it is gruesome it shows the reality of war and the immense strength it took so many people to resist knowing that at any time they could be killed."
3,Max Manus Man of War,"I purchsed this DVD for a Norwegian friend as a gift. She and I watched it together and she was quite familiar with the subject matter of the film since her father was also a very active member of the Norwegian underground during the Nazi occupation of Norway in WWII. Personally, I would have enjoyed it more if it had been ""voiced over"" in English. All-in-all, a good film and a reasonably accurate account of the Norwegian resistance against the Nazi occupation of WWII."
1,Death Medicine,"This is easily the worst book I have read in a long time. To start with, I've lived in Texas all my life and there never has been nor would there be a blizzard to equal the one in the book. And a B&B that has snowshoes! Give me a break. It was so bad that I started to notice quirks, like using seen for scene, and the incredibly weird font on the first line of every section. And the Jamaican porter talked like one of Harry Potter's house elves and not like any Jamaican (or other human being) that I have ever heard. Find something else."
4,Death Medicine,"Kat Goldring is a creative writer of admirable talent.Goldring has done a thoughtful job of story telling-mixing contemporary detective work with Indian mythology. Mystery swirls on every page of Death Medicine. Carefully written for those with the tensest of imagination. A classic ""page turner."""
4,what i think,i really would like this line of decor' if the same pattern where true to each line of products.I would like to see a title other than just blue jean bear on everthing.not all prints are the same.some have animals from the Ark and some have boats.some the bears have on different outfits. and you cant tell before you buy it that it does not match. Two different lines of design all together but one title.
3,Poor quality switch,"The lamp does looks great with the whole Blue Jean Teddy line, but after 8 months of use, the on/off switch broke with mine too."
1,NOT PLEASED WITH YOUR SERVICE WHAT SO EVER!!!,"I ORDERED THIS ITEM ALMOST 3 WEEKS AGO AND IT'S STILL ON DELAY. I CAN'T EMAIL OR GET INTOUCH WITH A HUMANBEING, SO I'M JUST TOLD IN MY EMAILS THAT I CAN'T CANCEL MY ORDER NOW, SO I JUST HAVE TO REFUSE PACKAGE WHICH IS CRAZY!!!!!! MY BABY IS DUE ANY DAY NOW AND IF I KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE THIS LONG TO GET THE LAMP FOR MY NURSERY THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE ORDERED THE LAMP. THANKS FOR NOTHING AND I WILL LET OTHER'S NO ABOUT YOUR TIME SERVICE. IT SUCKS!!!!!! PLUS, FALSE ADVERTISING SAYING IF YOU WANT THIS ITEM ORDER NOW AND HAVE IT TOMORROW. IF I ORDERED MINE THREE WEEKS AGO AND STILL HAVEN'T GOT IT, THEN HOW IS SOMEONE GOING TO ORDER THE TEDDY BEAR LAMP TODAY AND GET IT TOMORROW? LIKE I SAID, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!VERY UNPLEASED CUSTOMER,"
4,Seriously funny,Got this for my 5 yr old - we LOVED it. It is seriously funny. We are now looking forward to the rest of the series.
4,captian underpants,"Captian Underpants, the first book is great. It tells how it all started. It starts by introductionsthe Characters. The characters are Harold and Geroge. The day starts, byt with the prants. The got caught of what the did. The principal makes the do things. Harold a Geroge buy a ring. Thhis ring is different . The ring hipnotizes ppeople. George use it on the principal, Mr. Krubbs. George and Harold turn him into Captin Underpants. So now their principal is a super hero when they snape their fingers, Mr Kubbs turns into Captin Underpants. When water get poured on him, he turns back into himeself. Also the book has something that on other books has. That is the Flip-O-Rama. I recommend this book to kids that like adventure, fighting, and humor. This is the book for you."
3,a negative comment,"My son thought this book was hilarious, and I think most kids would....so I am hesitant to criticize something that encourages kids to read so much. But the fact is that I don't want my son growing up thinking it's ""cool"" and ""fun"" to pull pranks on other people like the main characters in this book do; I also want him to understand that people such as principals do need to be shown basic respect, even if one doesn't particularly like them. So because of that I'm not going to get other books in this series. There are tons of other chapter books that are funny and can encourage my son to love reading.On the positive side, it's fabulous that the two main characters in this book are very creative, making their own comic books (which will encourage creativity in kids who read these books); and, one friend is black and one is white. Because this inter-racial friendship is presented without ever making an issue of it I think it is a positive friendship model for children."
4,Captin Underpants!,"Captin Uderpants is a really funney book, about two kids(Harold and George). That get into a lot trouble. They make comic books about a super hearo that wears nothing but,well you geussed it underpants. But one day they turn their mean principal(Mr.Krupp)into...Tra-La-Laaaaaaaaaa CAPTIN UNDERPANTS! My friend Gavin gave me the first 3 books. I read them all in the first day. I'm a fourth grader. I would really recommend these books!"
4,About two boys in fourth grade that hypnotize the principal,"It's about a principal who is hypnotized by two boys in the fourth grade. First they turn him in to a chicken, then they turn him in to a monkey, then they turn him in to Captain Underpants. Then he runs away. They find him in front of a bank. Then two robbers run out the door. Captain Underpants says, ""stop in the name of underpants!"" I really liked this book. It was very funny. I would reccomended this book for five (years old) and up."
5,A wet your pants kind of book!,"Captain Underpants stole my second graders hearts! Fantastically hysterical, innovative, and refreshing! Pilkey starts the series with an, ""I've got to hear another book like this one!"" Children of all ages... and some silly adults, too, will love to read this!"
3,All at Jerome Horwitz Elementry school,Three Stooges fans take note: Jerome Horwitz was Curly Howard's real name!
1,lsms,"I read the Captain Underpants book in 3rd grade, and even then found it immature. It is one thing to have a superhero be a man that flies around in his underpants, but the books are filled with nothing but jokes about toilets and such. I can't believe these books are allowed in school. If children talk about that kind of stuff in school, they are punished, but still allowed to read about it. If I were the author, I would be ashamed to be a grown man, and be writing about toilets that attack people. Only little kids write about that."
1,I hate it,Captain underpants is a stupid book. It has LOADS of innapropiate humor and LOTS of disgusting things such as poop and pee. Who are the idiots who think this book is good? Retarded.
5,"Highly recommended, great gift for girls or boys","After hearing about this series on NPR, I immediately ordered the first two books. I didn't get a chance to look at them myself, since I had them delivered directly to a 7-year-old, but her mother told me the girl loved them right away and couldn't put them down. The girl thanked me personally too and finished reading the first book in a half-week. I can't wait to see them myself and send more."
4,I love this story,"Yeah the pages might be short and the book isn't long but, I loved it a laughed and giggled on the whole way thought the story. I loved it the story is hilariously amazing. Its one of my favorite story's. It's great for the kids who love to write because it gives you an imagination. I read it a lot because I love to write and if in gives an imagination I can write for about 2 hours and have a chapter book. I won't stop reading Dav's story's because they are one of my favorite. If your kid can read or if you can read go out and get this book. The pictures are great and the sentences are so intriguing. I hope you will like this intriguing story too. by D.B."
4,"silly, funny, perfect read aloud, pictures add zest","My daughter loved this book and it is the first chapter book she has ever been able to sit through. We read it together in one afternoon while she waited for a friend who was late, and she was delighted and eager to listen the entire time. She just turned 8 and has ADD and learning disabilities. This very silly and easy to understand story is just what she needs to encourage her listening and comprehension skills! It's not classic literature, but it's honestly funny, and not offensive, and genuinely clever in its illustrations. Only the most humorless parent will not enjoy reading it with their kids. You get to say some pretty funny stuff!"
4,Captain Underpants,"The format of this book is so unique and that's is why I found it one of my favorite books. It is about two elementary aged boys who love to create comics and their favorite super hero is Captain Underpants. The two boys some how, I am not going to tell you, made their principle think that he was captain underpants. The adventures that the two boys encounter are hilarious. It is a good book because it is different from the normal chapter books. For example there is a small flipbook. The book makes reading fun and it sparks the children's interest to write their own stories. The author does great job at expanding the imagination"
4,Captain Under Pants is so funny,"The most menorable monent in the book is when boys got the hypnotize ring. Then they went to Mr. Krupp. Then they hypnotize Mr. Krupp. He jumps out the window. I drop down and giggly.The theme is doing hypnotize people and pour water on them. Or pay attention in school. It a big thing not to get in trouble in school, it ok to have fun but don't over do it."
5,Fun to read and will make you laugh .,This book is really enjoyable (along with others Dav has written) It is different which makes it enjoyable for young readers. Anything with underwear is funny for kids. My husband reads the books to third graders. They look forword to it each week.
3,Williams latest release is uneven,"Andy Williams can be the best singer ever when his material is on target, but in this twofer, the singer's opening tracks are so off ther mark that it hurts to listen. After listening to the Days of Wine and Roses, one has to wonder how this became Andy's best-selling album. Except for the title track, Can't Get Used to Losing You and May Each Day, this CD blares with over-produced overaccompanied renditions of classic tunes that finds Williams yelling at the top of his lungs to stay above the din. Especially disappointing Falling In Love Again, You Are My Sunshine, When You're Smiling and Exactly Like You, which contains an insipid chorus yelling out ""Yeh, Yeh, Yeh."" These are tracks you'll want to skip over. But Williams redeems himself with the second album, In The Arms of Love. Everything is well done and the orchestrations are classic Williams. Especially good is the samba-inspired So Nice, Pretty Butterfly, A Man and A Woman."
2,Quality not that good,"This table is nice but there are some design flaws in the construction. When putting it together, we found that the base starting coming apart. Also after it was all together, one leg is shorter than the rest. It looks nice but I'm afraid to lean on it."
1,Sea and Cakes ALL TIME WORST !,In a career that outshines all the indie pretenders The Sea and Cake have had more than their share of clunkers. Before you is the bottom of the barrel. Slickness and Gloss can be truly amazing when done right. Prekop steps up to the plate and falls asleep.Worst of all-There is no CONTENT here! Mumbles and electronic mediocrity. Look anywhere else to get the real deal. Completely vapid stuff! Truly horrible!
1,What happened to Sea & Cake?,"I'm stunned by how weak this CD is. Owning all their previous work hadn't prepared me for this. What's wrong? Hmmmmmm. Well to begin with it's terribly monotonous. The electronica/drum machines, etc. (they seem to have taken over here)drone and parallel Prekop's indistinct vocals. Most tracks lack the subtlety, spacing and breath of all their earlier releases. Their usual playfulness and inventiveness are missing too. What can I say- a major disappointment by a superior creative team."
1,Geez... timid album,Probably the weakest of their last three. These guys need to move in a new direction. Can you say stagnation? I knew you could! Terrifc cover though.
4,A cohesive electronic statement,"This album is a huge departure from The Sea and Cake's previous album, Oui. On Oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. On One Bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. The guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. The division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. What's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. Not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of David Bowie's ""Sound + Vision"" makes sense next to the original compositions. So, if you're interested in the Chicago music scene, if you like electronic music, or if you're a fan of tasteful light rock, go listen to this album now."
3,More of the Same,"Like the Bodean's, these guys from Chicago can put out three CD's with six songs on them! I liked ""Fawn"" and ""The Biz"" sort of. The latter I gave to a friend. But, I was expecting something new form them on ""One Bedroom"". Nope."
4,Picks up where 'Oui' left off.,"The Sea and Cake's latest is very much in keeping with the moody pop soundscapes that filled much of 'Oui.' It's definitely a more electronically-oriented sound, and although it isn't quite as melancholy as Oui, it does have the same quiet intensity of that album. This group has never really been about the lyrics, thanks to Prekop's stream-of-consciousness writing, and here they do more to compliment the sound and heighten the mood than ever before. I also thought this album was more solid throughout than any of their previous releases. Highly recommended."
4,"Great and absorbent, but size medium fits small","Mom wakes up dry most mornings, and she pees like SeaBiscuit. These are great, very absorbent, hold a lot. I do add a poise pad for even more absorbency since she urinates so much at night. But they keep me from having to change the sheets! Thank goodness for that. Only complaint is it says it fits waist up to 44 "" No way! Mom wears a size 10 slacks, and the medium is very tight on her. I'll order large next time."
4,great value,"We used the carrier to transport our 10 pound Cockapoo from LA to Chicago. The carrier arrived promptly. Assembly was a bit challenging: putting the door on was a pain, but doable. Do be sure to put screws and bolts in to firmly attach the top and bottom halves. They are not included but really need to be there to ensure that the carrier won't separate if banged around. It is firm and secure, has a nice handle and notches for a strap (strap not included though), the door is strong, and the air slats allow circulation but limit the vision somewhat to hopefully not let the environment be too overwhelming for your pet. We were very impressed, especially for the price. Be sure to have some kind of bedding to put inside as that is not included either."
3,Not Bad. But door does not open easily!,Not terribly hard to put together. I purchased 2 of these and the spring-opener is difficult to open. Other than that it's a fine pet carrier.
5,THIRD EYE OPENING,Dr. Richard D. King succeeds in creatively combining Ancient African information with today's knowledge to provide new hope for the survival of the black community and ultimate survival of this world in general. Simply Amazing! A must see for anyone who wants to know what it truly means to be black. The definition Webster was unwilling to supply.
5,Another 'Hip' Album!,"As a big fan of Gord Downie's story songs, I have to admit I bought this album purely for the song Nautical Disaster. As ususal with the Hip, the entire album is a great piece of work. It's wonderful to see that as their trademark sound has evolved they've never lost their underlying rock 'n' roll heart. The comparisons to REM are completely unfounded--Mr. Stype ought to wish he had Downie's song writing abilities, and if he doesn't he's a fool. How this band isn't a bigger hit in the US is beyond me."
5,"Better than ""Fully Completely""?","I'll never understand the comparisons between the Hip and REM...Gord Downie does not sound too much like the REM lead singer, REM has never ""rocked"" like the Hip so often do and REM's lyrics are not as poetic or literate. ""Nautical Disaster"" by itself, makes this album worth what you pay for it. I just can't decide if I like this album better than ""Fully Completely"""
5,Totes Awesome!,"There are so many highlights on this CD. Where to start? ""Abilene"" is beautiful and sad, ""When I was Your Girl"" is an unabashed rocker. The country elements are subtle and effective, and the songwriting is deeply felt. If you like Lucinda and Emmylou, you'll dig this record."
1,DO NOT BUY SO STUPID,"WOW THIS WAS SO TERRIBLE I WATCHED JUST THE FIRST BEGINNER PART OF THE DVD AND I WAS LIKE ""ARE YOU SERIOUS"" THE GUY IS SO DUMB THE VOICE COACH I THINK HE IS A SERIAL KILLER HE IS SO BAD ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY HE REALLY LIKES TEETH HE IS LIKE SHOW ME YOUR TEETH ITS SO WEIRD AND THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE PAULA ABDUL BUT HER AND RANDY AT THE BEGINNER TALKED LIKE THEY WERE PAYED TOO TALK AND IT LOOKED BAD, INSTEAD BUY THE SINGING FOR DUMMIES BOOK THAT IS A GREAT BOOK THIS IS A STUPID DVD AND THE PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE ME A REFUND"
1,THE ULTIMATE WASTE OF TIME & $,"I would give this item MINUS stars if I could. This is clearly just people trying to make money. Gary Catona's supposed ""Beginner,Intermediate, and Advanced"" ""lessons"" are IDENTICAL - just three different people singing the same scales on the same vowels. No discussion whatever of proper breathing technique or how to produce sound. I really cannot give an objective evaluation of Mr. Anderson's portion of the DVD, it might have been better, but I fell asleep trying to watch it and simply couldn't be bothered to try to watch it again. Ms. Abdul's and Mr. Jackson's...um..""acting?"" is so painfully unnatural and overdone, it's really difficult to watch them. I am so glad I rented this from Netflix rather than having bought it - these people should all be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for having produced such a completely worthless DVD that promises so much and delivers nothing."
5,good exercise,"the negative reviews i think is totally wrong, ive been singing more than 20 years, but this dvd, helps me to how to let go of my voice and how to prolonged it, its just exercise so it may sound corny like how you sing it its long and going up and down which is a very good vocal exercise, after doin this exercises im proudly singing now with all confidence my voice got higher, and stronger, and learned how to simply let go of that voice , my dvd was over used as i said i use it almost everyday and planning to get one for my daughter =)"
2,"""Appalling"" -- Simon","There's lots of voice instruction CD's available at much better prices.The quality of instruction here is no better than others at half the price, and the video presentation doesn't help at all.Their starting point isn't for beginners.And what it does have won't add anything for the more advanced student."
3,Voice coach,This was not what I expected. I was somewhat disappointed. I should have gone with my first choice.
2,Better product out there,"I received this as a gift from my mother. This is mostly like purchasing an infomercial. It doesn't deliver that much teaching, although it's not as bad as some people have said. I have purchased a number of singing lesson dvds and my favorite so far is the Singingbelt System. The Singingbelt itself is a brilliant device. It works really well, but Gerson's instruction on the video for singing is outstanding. She's a great coach. The real deal. There's so much information, but she's methodical which I like. Sometimes she talks a little too fast, I had to rewind a couple of times. The instructional vocal warm-up CD it comes with is also great. I put it in my car and use it to and from work. My pitch has greatly improved. I like the whole section about singing over diphthongs as well."
2,I loves Paula and Randy but..,"After watching how Eric Mueller sung in the audition with the comments over here, i don't think i would ever think to buy this DVD anymore.Poor Eric, does he get a refund after that??"
1,BEWARE: THIS CAN DAMAGE YOUR VOICE!,"Folks, this is a total rip-off.The Gary Catona stuff is so TIGHT and FORCED, you could easily damage your voice doing this type of thing everyday improperly. You could give yourelf nodules very easily.Singing on the ""core of the voice"" has to be done very carefully, its too advanced, and not for beginners, and is not even explained. VERY DANGEROUS TO YOUR VOICE!Ron Anderson just gives you some basic classical scales and breathing exercises, with too much manipulation, and tensions, and rigidness. The way he gets you to ""round your voice"" is just tension, and will make you sound like [...], and spoil your natural voice.These guys are both total amateurs, and somehow they don't wreck whatever ""famous"" students they allegedly have.Bottom line, this DVD is a rip-off.and folks, if you want to sing, you have to learn how to VOCALLY RELAX, otherwise you are toast."
1,Shameless promotion!,"That anyone can learn to sing by reading a book or by watching this mis-guided DVD is mistaken. You ALWAYS need a second pair of ears to guide you, and Mr. Catona's idea that it is OK to gag and feel a ""tickle"" in the throat or pain is just irresponsible. Would you play, walk or run on a sprained ankle, or with any kind of pulled muscle? At least Mr. Anderson talks about breathing and ease of production. Mr Catona's concept of facial tension is just wrong and where is the ""O"" vowel? A bad idea, sponsored just to make money by Abdul and Jackson.Buyer and Singer BEWARE!!!"
1,Absolute Garbage!,"You have a better chance of learning how to sing by going out and watching the drunks at karaoke.Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson slapped their names and images on this useless and cheap product to make a quick buck. The ""lessons"" were recorded in what looks like a living room in someone's house where they threw tablecloths over the window to cut down on light.The graphics are hoakey and childish. The producers must've enlisted the work of the SPECIAL ED GRAPIHICS DEPARTMENT. The quality of the product is absolute GARBAGE after you get by the marketing. Even Paula and Randy appear cheap and second rate in their 30 second bits. A HUGE DISSAPPOINTMENT. When I saw how bad ultimate voice coach was put together I felt like an absolute sucker. I read bad reviews and still bought it, and it's my own fault for being optimistic. I just wanted to learn how to sing. There have got to be better ways than this load of steaming $#!%"
2,Huge Disappointment,"This product has good intentions, but DON'T be fooled into thinking it is anything special. It was made on a shoe string budget and looks like it was thrown together in a matter of an afternoon. The set includes a DVD of voice lessons, a practice CD (which is really only the audio from the DVD made to fit on a 70min CD...totally a joke) and an embarrassingly bad Karoke CD. The only reason, if you can even find one, to buy this set is for the voice lessons on the DVD. If I were Gary Catona I would be ashamed to have name on this poor product."
1,I can't believe how bad this is,"Gee I asked my mom to give me this because a friend told me that Paula Abdu it is good, but how disappointing...Don't ask your mom to give you that, ask for something else."
2,The Truth Is,"This truth is, I don't like the remixes. They don't have anything to do with this band. The only reason why I bought it was for the unreleased track ""Without A Reason."""
1,Pura mentira...,"Este tipo es pura mentira lo que escribe en sus canciones, ofende a sus seguidores... un materialista más."
4,French funk and great disco -- must have for your collection,I really like this kind of music that's coming out of France at the moment. Easy disco with not much need for thought. Mixes from brazilian to a taste of 70's -- the kind of music you play in the background while pottering around the house on your own in your knickers with an odd shimmy here and there!!!
4,Good Reading,Although the book does contain some typos and mismatched schematics with text the author does a fine job of introducing the 4093 and progresses logically to circuits of increased function or complexity. The beginning chaptors provide an intro and methods of interface to other devices. Some of the bistable circuits were difficult to get working reliably but an overall well authored book and referance. I would purchase it again.
1,Bad stuff!,"The old saying, you get what you pay for, really applies here. This rosin would not transfer to strings at all. It was so hard it was like rubbing a piece of glass on the strings.I even tried to heat it up with a blow dryer to soften it, didn't work. This stuff sucks!"
5,It works,I got this for my daughter that plays the violin. It works fine and the price was good. Satisfied customer.
5,Want to relax? Listen to this.,"So you want to buy a great chill-out album but you don't know which one to get? Start with Ambient Lounge Vol. 4 and you won't be disappointed. This CD is a mood setter for a cool Friday night, relaxing every bone in your body with its catchy laid-back grooves. The artists on this CD remind me of the work of Robert Miles' ""Fable,"" and ""Dreamland,"" while some of the other songs remind me of some late-night jazz while other songs remind me of divas like Shirley Bassey and Marlena Shaw. I would highly recommend this album if your big into laid-back electronic music, but not into hardcore heart-throbbing techno."
5,I like the different and bright colors!,This mobile works really well. I used it for over a year and it never gave out like some other mobiles I've had. Attached to the crib securely.
2,frustrated,"This mobile is the perfect finishing touch to the blue jean teddybear collection. The only problem is it wasn't big enough to fit the slats on the baby crib, and this is a new crib. I think they should make all of them universal to fit all cribs. If it wasn't for that I would of given it 5 stars."
3,Frustrated,"We bought this mobile for our son due in 7 weeks. When we went to attach it to the crib, the ""mouth"" was not wide enough to fit the crib slats on our sons ""convertible birth -?"" crib. We will have to take this mobile back and purchase a different mobile."
4,He giggles for hours!,"My 2 1/2 month loves to ""talk"" to his mobile after his early morning feeding. He especially likes the black & white panda. He giggles and coos at them as they dance around his head. Moms - this gives me 2 hours more sleep in the morning! The animals detach from the plastic mobile too so he will be able to play with them when he gets older. The only way to improve it would be a longer musical session."
3,A little different; still good,"As another reviewer has said, Green is not a polished writer, and expecting perfection from her is to expect far too much. That being said, most of her books are very enjoyable. This one is a little different from the detective story format that I most associate with her, but there is a female character that approaches (but does not completely fill) the detective role. In my opinion, the biggest flaw in the book is its slow start. I was literally more than halfway through before I really got interested in the story. But once things picked up, the rest of the book was great. This is certainly not Green's best work - far from it - and if you aren't a fan of hers already you will probably not enjoy it. But for fans of Green, hang in there through the beginning and it will be worth it in the end."
2,Revolution is a Bust,"The BANDLAND part of the CD was great.... the usual wonderful sound one expects from Les Brown, but I couldn't say much for the REVOLUTION IN SOUND part. I found the music fading in at the beginning and fading out at the end to be very annoying. I can't see that serves any purpose whatsoever. I had no idea this was done when I sampled the music from the AMAZON site, or I would not have purchased the CD."
4,La Favorita spreads are delicious!,"My family loves the artichoke and garlic cream spread, so I bought the assortment sampler to try. They were all good, but the artichoke and garlic is still the family favorite."
5,Whoa.,"This book is full of more ideas than a person could use in a lifetime! The ideas could be modified to fit any age group, from young children (4 or 5 yrs. old) to an adult group. Each activity focuses on learning an aspect of our God. It is great and I highly recommend it to a school teacher, Bible study leader, a preacher, anyone who wants to motivate others to learn the Word."
4,A Great Book of photos of a great band,"I am a devoted fan of the band Depeche Mode and I can tell you that Anton Corbjin and Depeche mode are now almost one in the same. This collection of photos spans the world with depeche mode. From photos taken in the dry earth of western USA to the now liberated east europe. This book is a must For anyfan or love of photgaphy in the Black & White Form. - Roger ""pimpf Boy"" Erickson"
3,Not sure what I expected,I ordered this as a gift for my husband. I was a little disappointed with the box it came in as it was a little worn. I also expected more from the shield. My husband really liked it though so I gave it 3 stars.
5,Awesome!,"I bought this as a gift for my father, who is a huge captain america fan, i knew he liked the original shield compared to the newer circular shield. great detail was put into this collectors item and i recommend it for any collection!"
2,Kindle book is incomplete!,liked the story! Bertrice small is really a master of historical romances. I don't find her books too focused on sexual scenes. for me it is just the right amount to stimulate the readers. the only downside to this book is that the kindle edition is incomplete. I hope kindle rectifies this oversight.
3,Predictable and unexciting,"I've read and enjoyed several of Ms. Small's books. This one just didn't cut the mustard. The characters were stereotypes (virile, long suffering husband; selfish wife; goody-two-shoes sister; evil nobleman friend, etc.) and frankly there was no suspense. Glad I checked this one out from the library instead of spending $10+ for it (and why are Ms. Small's books in the pricier large trade paperback format, anyway?)."
2,Definitely not Skye O'Malley,"This is the first of Bertrice Small's books I've read that was not part of the Skye O'Malley series and I'm really glad now I read the series first, because this book would have turned me away from Ms. Small forever! What happened to the deep characters, the catch-you-by-the-throat-and-pull-you-in plots that have charcterized her previous books? This book was wishy-washy from the start! I understood that Skye couldn't live forever, but if this is any indication of how future books will be, I'll stick with re-reading Skye O'Malley and forgo anything else!"
1,An Apt Title,"The readers were DECEIVED!!! This book sucked. Apparently, Small and Woodiwiss have the same agenda- bore their readers to death. What happened to the great writing of the past?"
3,It was okay,"This book started off good but got a little boring when Valarien married Aurora. I liked Aurora but I wasn't fond of the other characters in the book. I didn't hate this book but it's not on my top 10 list of the best B. Small books. I plan to read all of Ms. Small's books, so I'm glad I read it."
3,You're better off finding another of Ms. Small's books,"Ms. Small has always written a provocative and interesting story. I found Deceived to fall far flat of her previous books. The characters seemed shallow and not very full of life. I can appreciate the theme of finding more than one love in a lifetime, but the way inwhich she tried to capture this idea did not quite work.Usually, Ms. Small's stories go into great depth about the time period she is writing about. This story did at times as well, but somehow I didn't get the feeling of actually being there, which I usually do. For a better read, read ANYTHING Ms. Small has written previously."
4,"Not her best, but enjoyable nonetheless!","This book started out just a tad slow, but still enough to keep my attention. I agree with other reviewers that some characters appeared one-dimensional--namely the heroine's sister. Further, later actions and thoughts of the heroine with regard to her sister--after a middle of the book climax, I found a little hard to believe. But aside from having to suspend belief for those few actions and thoughts, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. There was little mincing of words once ""love"" was discovered, and the sensual portions of the book were just that -- very sensual. Ms. Small is still one of my favorites."
2,Very Disappointing.,"As an avid fan of Ms. Small, I found this one rather boring. The plot had some possibilities but didn't live up to its promise. The few lovescenes here were not as intense as they used to be,..."
1,Horrible!,"Dear readers, this book was one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read! Aurora and Cally was such coniving little witches! What they did to Valerian was unforgivable. I knew that the sisters would switch places. That was why I wanted to read the book in the first place, but the author made it turn out so bad for the hero and Cally ,that it was not cute anymore. I also felt no attraction for the hero. Maybe it was because Cally treated him with such scorn. I am sorry, but I like my heroes to be appealing and wanted! This was my third book by Bertrice Small and I find that she is not to my taste. The only thing I like about her books is her sex scenes!"
2,not her best,"I am a huge Bertrice Small fan and own every single one of her books but this is easily my LEAST favorite and the only one I have only read once. It was flat and boring compared to her other work with little of the exquisite detail that I have come to appreciate. If you are just starting to read Ms. Small's work please start with something else, like the wonderful Kadin or any of the early Skye O'Malley series!"
3,"Not one of her best, but it's okay.","Aurora and Valerian's characters are okay - I'm at a loss for more words than this. The story is palatable at best, downright silly at worst. It's not one of her better stories. Mediocrity is the best word that I can find for it. You'll do better with an earlier novel than this, but if you have to pick it up, it's not bad."
2,Disappointment - Did Ms. Small write this one?,"I believe I have read almost all of Ms. Small's books - the Skye O'Malley series, etc. It didn't take too many pages before I was asking myself the question ""Is this Bertrice Small? Is someone else writing under her name?"" It reads like a light Jayne Anne Krentz/Judith McNaught. Although I enjoyed it - it was not up to her usual standards."
2,Too Preachy,"Instead of giving helpful advice, this book lectures. I'd rather read a book that helps my husband and I address our problems, than one that sets itself up on a pedestal. I'm sure the Garcia-Prats are a remarkable couple, but I'm not sure how they qualify as experts."
2,Nothing New,"I read the Garcia-Prats' first book, which was okay, but this one is simply a lot of recycled information. Some of the advice is amazingly impractical, i.e. when they talk about forgiveness. Mrs. Garcia-Prats cites a saint who forgave her daughter's rapist. In the framework of a marriage, this seems like a reach. Much of the rest of the book appears to consist of quotes and ideas taken from other ""experts."" This isn't the place to look for fresh, practical ideas. That said, they look like a nice family with cute kids."
1,we don't want re-recordings,I wonder why music companies issue re-recordings. All people are looking for original recordings. They did the same with marty balin and others artists. RETURN THE CD and get your money back. The music companies should learn at last to issue only original recordings.
5,They sound just as good as ever !,"I too have been searching the internet looking for my favorite bands, and I finally found Stonebolt. I've been a fan for a long time, and the music just reaches out and grabs you. From ""Don't you hide it"" to ""I will still love you"", long time listeners will remember the smooth sounds and haunting lyrics, and new listeners will be treated to a delight of great music. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes a little bit of easy rock, with a couple of beautiful ballads for good measure. This one should be in everyone's CD collection !"
3,50/50 Hit or Miss...,"Bought 1 for my 1999 gsr, and 2003 crv.1999 gsr = Scosche fit better in my gsr then the metra mounting kit.2003 crv = Metra fit better then the scosche mounting kit."
1,Very disappointed....,"Good luck with the instructions. Unit is cheap plastic and some of the main supports are ""snap on"". Still deciding if I'm going to put it in the car or throw it in the trash. If I do install it and it doesn't fall to pieces the first day, I'll be surprised."
4,"great book, but....","The book Is great! it should be required reading for All students! a clear, concise, and irrefutable explanation of our history and constitution. I recommend this to everyone! HOWEVER...After paying $49.00. plus shipping. I opened the cover to find, the original price of the book to be $12.95. I was a little shocked to say the least. Especially when the condition was ""Good Used"" or ""shelf beaten new"". for the inflated price I paid, it should have been ""perfect"""
4,"Fits, didn't work with my much older Stant tester though.","Fits, didn't work with my MUCH older Stant tester though. Make sure your pressure tester will work with this. Not sure why but i believe Stant may have changed the air outlet positions on newer tester models."
4,Works great,No problems with this product. This radiator adapter works as described. I bought it for a 2003 Nissan Frontier truck.
3,coolant adapter,"works well , just didn't fit what amazon said it would ,but the cars it does fit it works"
5,Great adapter for the price,"I was sort of hesitant to purchase this, as it will be used professionally in a shop, and most of the stant adapters are much more expensive and robust, but so far this has worked out very well.It gets occasional use on a variety of cooling systems, and has worked quite well.It's a bit diffent than the chrome/metal variety that have a fixed sealing system, this has more of a floating insert, that is a bit awkward at first. Once you get it down though, it's pretty easy to use and does a great job, considering it costs about 1/3 what the heavy duty old style metal Stant adapters do.Overall, I would highly recommend it for the occasional user. I would be careful to check the application though, it seems some have found that it does not fit their vehicle."
3,"Hardly ""Difinitive""","As someone who sees lighthouses on the NH Seacoast, I wanted to find out more about lighthouses in general- and ordered this book.While it is a good collection of quick facts, it has made two glaring omissions- the Boon Island Lighthouse off York Maine is not mentioned (and that is a dangerous place!) and the Plum Island Lighthouse seems to be refered to as as the Newburyport Range Lights - which are the only intact pair of navigational lighthouses still standing.on the waterfront near downtown Newburyport MA.If there are two glaring errors such as this within a 30 mile stretch of coastline, how many others may be within this book?"
2,Magazine organizer - Very Flimsy,I have purchased several dozen of these and wish I hadn't. They are so thin and flimsy that the magazine flops around in the three ring binder. If they were about twice a thick they would probably work ok. Worth about $1.00 a dozen. Not $3.90 a dozen. There is a manufacturer who sells much heavier ones but I have been unbable to find out the suppliers name.
4,Great soundtrack,"It's not every day you find a soundtrack with a lot of great songs like this. The unreleased songs from Megadeth, and Machine Head are fantastic and are some of the best I've heard from the respective bands. Hearing Pantera's classic ""Cemetery Gates"" and other great songs from Sepultura, Rollins Band, Biohazard, and Filter (when they were good) make this a great buy."
1,Yucko!,"This was the worst thing I have EVER heard. Although I did laugh and laugh with my friend Brian all through the whole thing! All this talk about her ""brilliance"" has me baffled! If you want a good laugh or leave her skin crawling oriental screams on someones answering machine for a joke buy this album. Who will actually ENJOY this so called music? The answer in Yoko's words:""There is No-bo-dy, got it? Got it got it got it?"""
4,When's the next one coming?,"Let's face it, those minions who bash Yoko out there are either chauvanists or bigots--take your pick. Sure, her voice isn't Beverly Sills but she definitely has sincerity (as well as talent!). Recently I bought all of Yoko Ono CDs and I have to say her artistic input over the years has been consistently good. This, her latest CD, is no exception. In fact, this is one of her rare CDs to mix her avant garde (e.g., Mulberry) with her songcraft (Is This What We Do). Usually it's either one or the other. Also: for anyone who doesn't know: when Yoko writes a melody, it's melodic, and her avant garde is not only listenable but intriguing. The only reason it's not five stars for me is that I'd like to hear Yoko write more lyrics beyond the topic of women's liberation (her typical subject matter)--or maybe I'm just the chauvanist here. At any rate: her ideas are always interesting. Meaningful music for people who have mind and ears, not contempt."
4,The Dragon Lady Soars High Above the Banal,"It's easy to knock Yoko Ono. She's so different. This is an interesting record. I don't know much about the lady behind these primal screams and electric moods, but I sure hope I am this positive and have this much energy when I am 68."
1,Typical Ono,"Better production values than on past recordings, perhaps, but the same old pretentious garbage from a woman who has built an entire career on pretentious garbage."
3,It's Alright,"Definitely has its moments, but I think BLUEPRINT FOR A SUNRISE is too dependent on the past. There is too much sampling from earlier Yoko songs, plus unnecessary alternate versions of previously released material (""Wouldnit - swing"" is particularly weak). Is Yoko running out of ideas, or just too busy with other projects to put much effort into her recording career? This will probably go down as my second least favorite Yoko album, FEELING THE SPACE getting top ""honors"" as my least favorite Yoko release. But, let me end on a positive note! I really like ""I'm Not Getting Enough."" This is Yoko at her most ingratiating, and probably her best reggae-pop song ever."
1,Curiosity Killed the Cat (or at least it sounds that way),"I obtained this CD out of curiosity after reading a review of it in people magazine. I'm glad I did!! I have gotten HOURS of enjoyment from this CD. Yoko Ono is a comic genius. I've never laughed so hard in my life. I would have given this CD 5 stars if I thought it was SUPPOSED to be funny. People really take this music seriouly? Wow, as Yoko says ""Get a Life."""
5,Good Service,Great service ... exactly as advertised. or even better. I was expecting the same from their reputation and reviews.word 1 word 2 word 3 word 4
1,A complete waste of money,"I bought this book expecting a quick ramp-up on T-SQL. What I got instead was an amateurish romp through a variety of SQL Server-related technologies. The writing is poor and fails to stay on point. Worse, the tangents the author(s) gets off on are often loaded with incorrect/out-dated information. It appears that the MS SQL Books online have been virtually copied (and maybe even some of the examples!). I returned this one for my money."
1,Not worth the trouble of reading it,"This book has several fundamental flaws. First, it doesn't stay on point. There are all sorts of tangents and asides that totally waste your time. Second, it's written really poorly. The prose is boring and plain. Third, it's inaccurate in many places and leaves out newer commands and important details. I returned this one for a refund."
5,Keep it as a desktop reference,"This text assumes that you are intelligent but do not yet know T-SQL. Based on that assumption, it explains at the lowest level, and progresses rapidly. Once you have gone through the learning curve with the book, you will find that it is handy to have at your desk. Put it this way - Three times I loaned my copy to other programmers, and all of them ended up buying their own copy!"
1,Total waste of print,"This book spends 500 pages exploring what's already covered quite adequately in the Books Online. Why would anyone write a book that does this? Also, there are several glaring ommissions. As a beginner, I found this book to add little to what's already provided with the product."
1,A simplistic reproduction of the Books Online,"All the info in this book can be found in the Books Online. It reads like a printed version of them. A word of advice: before you buy this book, do two things. READ the BOL completely, then browse the book in a bookstore BEFORE you buy it. If you don't see the redundancy, buy the book."
3,Teach Yourself Transact - SQL in 21 Days,The book is used each day by members of our analytics team. Very helpful and resourceful.
3,"decent place to start, but.....","This book is good for the absolute beginner to TSQL (or SQL). But there are several glaring omissions in this book. How can you leave out ALTER TABLE in a SQL book? I am still miffed by that. If you are serious about SQL, do not use this book as a ""reference""; rather, use it as an introduction. And it is an excellent INTRODUCTION, suited to the complete novice. But after you graduate from this book, go buy ""Inside Microsoft SQL Server 6.5"" by Ron Soukup - which is the best book I have read on the subject (if you're using MS SQL server, that is..)All in all, ""Teach yourself tsql"" is worth the money - but as you learn more you will say to yourself, ""Why wasn't that in the book?"""
1,"Unless you need a printed version of the BOL, don't buy it","I didn't find anything in this book that wasn't also in the BOL. I also don't think the presentation is any better. The coverage isn't systematic -- it jumps around all over the place. If you're going to learn something in three weeks, you can't take the seat-of-the-pants approach -- you have to attach the subject vigorously. Merely repeating the vendor online docs isn't going to cut it.There are also numerous technical errors in this book. The description of the DELETE and INSERT commands contain errors -- pretty alarming in a book like this.Don't like to give one-star reviews, but have no choice here. This one is definitely a turkey."
1,Not worth your time,Everything you find here you can find in the Books Online. I was expecting a systematic introduction to the language. What I got was a hackneyed referenced book. The only thing you'll learn in 21 days from this book is how utterly useless it is.
2,does what I need it to...barely.,"I am not a heavy-duty shredder. In fact, just a few old bills and some junk mail. However, this shredder does not handle even those small tasks well. I am constantly having to toggle the on/off switch just to get the job done. The paper gets stuck if I try and shred two sheets at a time (8-sheet my eye!). I would've sent it back if not for the pain of repacking the whole thing. Pretty disappointing."
1,No credible,"Who are these editors? How long have they been business? I'm a travel writer published in many publiscation and I never use this book for fact-finding for my articles. I think the internet is more reliable and accurate. With 1 travel book to my name, I have found everything for it on the internet."
2,textbook review,"Book offers a somewhat good overview of modern artists after WWII.I bought it for s class, so it is an OK."
3,sad but interesting,"Elizabeth is on trial for driving the car that killed Jessicas boyfriend,and Jessica is still holding a hate-ritual for her.It is a chillingly sad miniseries. I dont read it often as I cant take much of that killer,Margot."
4,Great remixes of a great track,"Lords of Acid have long been a favorite band of mine. This is a bunch of remixes of my favorite track from Our Little Secret. A few of the remixes really stand out and give some great variety to this single. If you like the album version, you'll like the remixes. Praise the Lords!"
5,Best zydeco album ever....,"...because it honors the artists and songs that bring individuality to this musical style. In much the same way that the Dillards diversified bluegrass music with Wheatstraw Suite, the songs here diversify zydeco beyond the usual accordian/rubboard repetition inherent in the style. Try to find the two disc set, where one disc doesn't have the narration. While the narration is essential to Terrance's story of tribute, it can get bothersome when you just want to listen to the music uninterrupted."
3,Not the best read on the subject,"This book does a decent job of just mentioning a bunch of facts, but I found that other similar books such as Open Road Publishing's ""Las Vegas with Kids"" 2nd edition or even Frommer's book with the same title do a better overall job. One problem is that the edition that I received (last week) was published in 1999. The kid friendly aspects of Vegas has changed since then. Some hotels are no longer kid friendly (by choice). For example, the book speaks of the MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park as an awesome place, but it closed back in 2000. Also, the other mentioned books seem to give more advice about WHAT to do rather that just listing everything that's available. I want to know what to do and what to skip. I want advice, not just a listing of all available destinations. A chapter on suggested itineraries would have been nice. After buying this book, I found that I needed to supplement it with the other Vegas with Kids travel books."
5,"A very informative, well organized information guide!",I was recently in Las Vegas. The information contained in this book greatly assisted me in locating and enjoying attractions I simply would have missed otherwise. Dean B. Mosser
1,sent wrong item,"Co. sent wrong item and wants me to call customer service when there open to resolve the problem. I work all day and don't have time to explain to some idiot, they listed the wrong part number in there ad. Just figure it out yourself and send me the correct part I already paid for."
1,Wrong handle! This is the side door handle,"This handle is for the sliding door, NOT the rear door. It is a nice handle and will work fine, just NOT on the rear door as indicated."
1,"yes, the books has its own weaknesses","The idea of writing poetry in an information age has never been questionable as it is now. ""The Butcher's Apron: New and Selected Poems"" not only challenges the role of language but it also abhors the idea of originality--Even the ""oppressive"" Victorians would have regarded such an experiment as mediocre. The reference to quantum physics is another attempt to rebel against contemporary society; almost as if to elevate the poet's unique character and diminish every scholar's existence. Obscure language and archaic metaphors were ""in"" thirty years ago, but now, especially when it's ""cool"" to be ""out,"" such literary devices are, in fact, ""out""-dated. Sorry, but this project didn't make the cut if only because the poet's language is no longer authentic, much less inspiring."
2,Cheap Darts,"Cheap darts aren't very good. They have a nice case and dart tool (I don't know how to use it and there is no instruction) after my first use one of the darts hit the floor a few times after the third impact with the floor the shaft supporting the flights was bent, I couldn't unbend it.I know darts should fall on the floor too often but if you hit the spider or have a dartboard that need replacing it can happen and it did.I'm rather disappointed."
1,Horrible Product,Don't waste your money on this product. I tried it twice (to make sure I did not make a mistake) and it did not come close to working. Elmers glue would have provided better sticking power.
1,Um...,"To start off, I'm not sure how this record would stand in comparison toDashboard's previous ones. Why? This is the only album I've heardof his. However, nonetheless, I didn't quite enjoy it. Don't get mewrong, I understand and enjoy some emo music, but this is reallypushing the envelope. Also, I think it's a little sad how Dashboard's managed to suck thousands of kids into ""loving"" this music. Don'tlet him suck you in. There's millions of great CDs out there. Thisisn't one of them - go buy the Bends instead."
3,Hands down...,"...Chris Carrabba gets my weiner hard. His boyish good looks and spiky faux-hawk make me wish I was a 15 year-old girl, holding his hand, licking an iced cream. Maybe he'll settle for a 19 year-old boy that wishes upon stars."
2,its ok,someone bought because I like Texas is the Reason Jawbreaker and FugaziI didn't like it much Hands Down So Bueatful Hey Girl and Will Not Break wrere ok
1,terrible cd honestly!,It's like Chris carabba stopped on the side of the road of his journey of good songwriting and asked how to get to mainstream way!!@!@ its like he got a beat with some untalented guitar work and made up random terrible words that dont make any sense(sharp disaster in a fresh new coma???) terrible. ... dont waiste any money on this please. I did

1,WARNING!!!!!!!,i personly never bought one of these cds but heck why would i?????though people love them i just dont get IT???!!! the lyics might be good but ahhhhh!!!!there music sucks.......no offense. one of my friends liked them and told me to get so i aske to listen to it first i begged her to turn it off!!!!!buy as yu wiSH but make sure you know what youre buying.......
1,IS THIS ON REPEAT?!?,"This is the worst display of musical abilities i have ever heard in my entire life! The first three songs are exactly the same, and upon close inspection, ALL SUCK!! I thought my cd player was on repeat, but it turned out it was three ""different"" songs (the only noticeable difference was the titles). I would rather watch moss grow on a large tree than ever listen to this album ever again! PLEASE DONT BUY THIS CRAP!"
1,Yeah...,"Ok people,most music is angst ridden anyway,so stop whining about that,the words of the great George Carlin,""it's all blues people"".Anyway,these guys truly suck,sure,the lyrics may be meaningful,as long as the guy who writes them feels that,but everything else sucks.The guitars,bass,drums,all suck.This guys singing must be one of the worst I have ever heard.Yeah,as far as I'm concerned,Dashboard Confessional suck major ass."
2,eh,chris carabbas way to fame. worst dc cd. hes very overrated. just look at further seems forever. their new cd is better without them and much better than any dc cd. go buy how to start a fire by fsf insted.
3,Why did yall drop the acoustic????,"WOW I must say I was so excited when this CD was initially released. Only problem turned out to be that they got rid of ALL the acoustic tracks.....What made Dashboard so great was songs like All The Best Deceptions and Screaming Infedelities. They have gotten away from their greatness and need to return to acoustic. Their are some good songs such as Bend and Not Break, Hey Girl, and Several Ways to Die Trying. I hope they consider going back to what made this group excellent."
1,bad,"um... let me just say this... if you're at ALL a fan of his first cd or even further seems forever save yourself the 10 bucks and buy something better... like, The Decemberists or... The Shins"
1,"Dashboard? Hmm, thought it was Further","I really wish I could give this CD a good review, but I have a big problem with this image change that they've done. They kick off their CD by making ""Hands Down"" (their best song in my opinion) electric, thus ruining eveyrhting that seperates Dashboard from FSF. ... I think that Chris needs to go back to Further, because their new singer [is weak] anyway. See what happens when good bands go mainstream? It's not an urban legend, everybody needs to stop supporting this mainstream nonsense, because every band that goes mainstream releases their next album 4 months late and when it finally comes out, it [is weak]..."
4,Plugged Up,"You might think that dashboard going from all acoustic to a full band (electric guitars and all) would be a big change. And maybe lose that something that set them apart from the rest of the crying little emo kids out there making sad sad music.But it doesn't, actually with carraba's 3rd album ""A Mark, A mission, A brand, A Scar"" Dashboard Confessional sounds better than ever.Their first radio single off the album ""Hands Down"" is, well hands down the best song on the album. But not to cut down the rest of the songs, this album is an emotional roller coaster. It just seems that putting down the acoustic guitar and plugging in an electric for a few songs adds an extra edge that ""The places you have come to fear the most"" lacked. Songs like ""carry this picture"" ""am i missing"" and ""so beautiful"" are highlights on a near flawless album.It Just misses out on a perfect score though with a well deserved 4/5."
3,Not as good as the last one but still a good one,"I think this album was good but kinda needed an extra kick in most of the songs. I thought the first track ""Hands Down"" was an amazing song and I think they did a great job with the new version. Another favorite of mine was ""Hey Girl"" because I thought it was a pretty catchy song. For me these are the only 2 catchy songs out of the whole album. I thought all of the other songs were just ok but still carry a lot of emotion through the singing. I think the singer has one hell of a singing voice. I just think there could've been more catchy songs on it just like the last album. DC Rules!!!"
3,What we Need is Something a Little Different,"I liked his Places... and Swiss Army Romance. They were pretty good decent cds. But I think this is going to the same well a little tooo much. It's just that every song sounds the same. If you just have one album, even one song: you've heard 'em all. There needs to be something more to get me into them again. I grow tired of his sad whining about girls and breakups and stuff. Write something new!"
1,What have you done to yourself?,"Even punk is what they have become. Let us not buy this CD but rather weep silently for the old Dashboard Confessional. Maybe he will come back to his senses and not to becoming quite a ridiculous sell out. I used to love this band. Now it has become not only like all the other bands, but even worse than them, because it used to be good."
2,Ehhh iss ok,"I heard Hands Down, the first single off this new album, it was a good song, i really enjoyed it, but its not worth buying the cd if you think all the songs are this good/type, i bought this cd hearing hands down and liking its newer version with an electric guitar in it hoping to find a much different/better sound, i was wrong, dont buy this cd just because of Hands Down or you WILL be disappointed."
4,hands down one of the best songwriters in his genre,"Florida native Chris Carrabba aka Dashboard Confessional, has really evolved musically in this album, his 3rd full length album. Although he doesn't totally stray away from the heart on his sleeve acoustic sound that many fans have grown to love, the presence of his newly formed back up band adds a surprising but complimenting element from time to time throughout the album. In fact some songs like ""Hey Girl"" lack acoustic guitar all together. But there's nothing about this album that says that Dashboard Confessional is going away any time soon. If you've seen them this past year on tour, then what you saw live has manifested into a freight train of emotion called ""A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar"". If you liked ""The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most"", then you will like this one."
4,Overall Good,"WOW! Big change in DC's style. I'm not sure if they've sold out or what.. they still rock but personally I like the old stuff. I think this album will probably appeal to the Sugarcult, Green Day, Simple Plan, and maybe even some Ataris fans. Hope I helped."
1,Not so disappointing considering he wasnt too good to begin,"Chris is just another one of those mtv-wannabes who try being emotional, and a true artist. It's not working. with his newest album, its only another display of his extremely limited vocal range which holds no sort of rich emotion at all. the acoustic guitar can be turned into so many things, but he chooses to use it in the same type of tune over and over again that only the younger of us can bare to listen to. grow up, then buy some real music. people who give this cd five stars is probably some sort of blinded fan that thinks anyone with a tatoo, a guitar, is on mtv, and their friends think is cool likes this cd. theres no use even trying to reason with the likes of such a person. save your money"
2,"YAWN, get over it","I must say, after hearing so much about this band, I was dissapointed to hear such a mundane set of songs. Sure, it's better than a lot of the cd's out there, in fact after returning 3 cds I would say this is the best one of what I got, but all the songs are so similar you might as well just get one single.I may not be easy to please, but I expected more being a fan of their type of music. The vocals put me to sleep and the repetitive tune is not much better.A lot of people seem to like it though, so I recommend listening to a couple of their (non-soundtrack) songs and then choosing whether or not to buy it.simply put, I found it boring."
3,Hmmm.,"Am I the only fan who thinks it disgusting to release the same album three times in less than a year? Don't get me wrong, I love Dashboard Confessional as much as I ever have but something isn't right anymore.If this is your introduction to Chris Carrabba, I'd recommend his album with Further Seems Forever (The Moon Is Down) first. If it's Dashboard Confessional you're after, look no further than The Swiss Army Romance or the So Impossible EP. Give this one a miss; DC have changed almost beyond recognition."
2,What happened!?,"I'm afraid to say they've lost their beauty. It is pretty hard to outdo Places You Have Come to Fear the Most, though.The only song I can stand to listen to on this album is Hands Down, but I have the original acoustic version and I love that a lot more.I loved Chris when there were little or no drums. This album is too punky and upbeat & it's lyrics have lost their passion, as did Chris's voice. It doesn't even sound emo.Go buy Places You Have Come to Fear the Most. It's loads better than this album."
3,SOLD OUT!!!!,"I just started listening to D/C the last week....then came across this CD....it's totally different. it's like he doesn't have the emotion or passion for the music that brought him to becoming a musician...They are a great role model to me...and have inspired me to try to become a musician. Its not a TERRIBLE CD...i would still recommend...but the old stuff is much much better. I don't know if they sold out or not...i think they did a little, because i saw a concert with D/C and he was using and electric guitar which is disappointing...and he has a creed haircut...O well there still awesome but this cd is by far the worst...hope this helps."
5,Dashboard Confessional,"This CD is amazing. Every single track has the potential to be a ""hit"". The lyrical content actually has relevance to people lives as opposed to some of the music out there these days. Chris Carraba uses his own personal experiences to relate to the listener. I found that to be extremely genuine. Dashboard has been around for several years, but still has not made it on mainstream, which in some ways makes them more appealing to me. If you liked their first few albums you will definitely find that A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar lives up to standards they set in earlier years. Although the sound is different from the sound of the first few albums, it still is AWESOME. BUY IT NOW!"
3,a real dc fan,i agree that this isnt the best of DC and i rahter have more of the old DC. and i was reading some of the other reviews and i start with the 1 stars first and i saw most of them were from people who dont even really like emo. so why would they even write a review. Chris is a very talented writer and his band is my favorite. Real fans dont think some ones a sell out from one bad album. So many bands have had good albums and one bad one. but anyways i thought this cd could have been much better and i do like some songs on here so buying it wasnt a complete loss. and thank you to the real fans and dont think he's a sell out of w/e from one bad cd.
1,You want ACOUSTIC? Um. No.,"... A lot of people say his acoustic songs are much better, and I have to say that the only reason why I don't mind Rapid Hope Loss and Hands Down is because of the electric guitar. Why magnify an already ridiculously falsetto voice by making it LOUDER? Please understand, I have nothing against his lyrics or whatever, but can't he like produce the album? And hire a real singer?? ..."
1,"Should have been called Further Seems Forever, instead of DC","I was really looking forward to the new D/C CD. It doesn't sound like Dashboard Confessional. The other 2 full length cd's are great Acoustic Songs! It was really the Acoustic style with his lyrics that made Dashboard Confessional stand out. But in this CD drums, electric bass and electrc guitars is added to all the songs... now he sounds like every other band. He really should have just gone back to Further Seems Forever if he wanted to be in a band like that. Sounds more like 'Further Seems Forever' Than it sounds like Dashboard Confessional. I'm sure many of the fans feel the same and hope in the next CD Dashboard Confessional comes back as it once was."
1,Why,"I lost all my respect for Dasbhoard. What ever happened to the good ol' acoustic sound. That's what was so great about Dashboard. The new Hands Down is horrible. Why would you ever add drums and electric guitar to it. The song is ruined, Dashboard is ruined. Buy Swiss Army Romance instead."
1,Such Talent!,"""Whoaaaaaaa, my girlfriend left me and I'm really sad! I have no friends to talk to so I'll write a song about it! Whoooa, come back, ex-girlfriend of mine!""=The lyrics on this albumEMO SUCKS! EMBRACE THE NEW WAVE OF AMERICAN HEAVY METAL!Lamb of God Shadows Fall Killswitch EngageThree bands, each three times more talented than this band!(unless bands wih singers who have actually hit puberty scare you)"
2,where have all the good times gone?,one word: boring. 2 great albums and 2 great EPs and then this stinker gets dropped. Hands Down is great (which was of course on an EP acoustic). and then it;s all down hill from there. Nothing on the CD is catchy. Nothing sticks in your head and makes you want to sing along. It's just boring. Chris Carraba should ditch the band and get back to buisness
1,ugh,"i've been a long time DC fan, and this cd was a total dissapointment. all it is is a more polished version of further seems forever. figures, my favorite song hands down (the so impossible version) had to be butchered. don't get this cd if you like acoustic dashboard better."
1,Deep...,"You know what the problem about this music is? Thatteenage girls listen to it and think they're listening to""deep music"". This is no deeper than Simple Plan orBarney and Friends. Let's get real... this guy is nearly thirtyyears old and is still talking about his high schoolromances. That isn't ""deep"" or ""touching"", it's obsessiveand old. So, if you want to be ""deep"" for the image justgo home. And if you want to be ""deep"" to be ""deep"" pick upa Radiohead album."
1,hands down this is the worst cd i can ever remember...,"i liken chris carrabba's transformation to that of jewel's: terrible, horrible, no good, very bad... claiming ""artistic growth"" when all you are really doing is selling out. from the tragic corruption of an oldie-but-goodie, ""hands down"" to the effeminate wails of ""ghost of a good thing"" this cd is by far a waste of money... unless you're a fan of bad music. :)"
4,Dashboard Revie,I highly recommend this cd to anyone that loves the sound of the guitar and great vocals. All the songs on this CD are fantastic and are very pure. enjoy
4,Good Cd,"If you liked ""The PLaces You Have Come To Fear The Most"", you will love ""A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar"". This cd combines catchy melodies with great vocals to leave you attached to this album. This is definetly worth your money."
2,Never Thought It Was Possible...,"If you want to love Dashboard, buy ""Places You Have Come to Fear the Most,"" ""Swiss Army Romance,"" or the ""So Impossible EP."" Those three CDs are three of my favorites in my collection, but this new CD is just so mainstream and poppy, it's hard to consider it emo. The first few songs are alright, and some of the songs he wrote a while ago (like ""Hands Down"" and ""Ghost of a Good Thing"") are great, but Chris Carrabba's newfound MTV-streak is disappointing and gives emo a bad name. If you're into MTV ""punk"" like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, go ahead and buy this CD - you'll love it. But if you're an actual emo-kid like myself, this CD will leave you wondering what the hell happened to Dashboard. You're better off buying his older CDs."
5,always and will be.,"dashboard confessional is straight to the point -- they're great. they're the type of band that writes songs that sound better and better everytime you listen to them. True they might not be punk or hard metal rock, but they're one of a kind.. what real music from the soul sounds like. personally, they're my favorite band in the whole world. i mean... there's only so many people that can actually write a song describing with passion the best day of their life. (hands down)trust me.. if you're open minded and willing, you'll have no regrets in buying this cd."
2,too commercial,"this is the album thats going to make chris popular. and no wonder. it's alot more commercial and popish than his last ones. there are some good tracks, like 'bend and not break' and 'am i missing', but i think that many die hard dashboard fans or fans of the work that chris did with previous band further seems forever, will be disappointed in this album. sorry its not more indepth, it hasnt taken my fancy to listen to it in awhile. its a bit of a disappointment- too commercial!and the worst bit- if chris ever does tour in australia because of the success of this album, there iwll be alot of screaming teeny boppers and few true appreciators :|"
5,"Dashboard - A mark, A mission, A brand, A scar","This is a great CD. No two ways about it. If you are into emo, or are interested in it, Dashboard Confessional are a must. This album contains heart felt lyrics, set to fantastic music. I dont really know what else to say, apart from - buy it. :)"
2,Carrabba's Curse: His Fans,"The thing about the reviews that precede and follow this is that the majority of them are written by rabid Dashboard Confessional fans, and I realize that combining ""rabid"" with ""Dashboard fan"" is an exercise in redundancy. First things first: This is not a change. This isn't Dylan in 1965 at the Folk Festival. Carraba's style hasn't gone hip-hop or pop or post-rock. This is still pop-punk. If you like Vagrant bands, odds are you'll like this.In the context of pop music as a whole, this will be a smash because it's great pop album. It has all the earmarks of overdramatic, pimply-teen mall muzak. This is not rock 'n' roll. It's not meant to be (and therefore should not be knocked on the basis that it doesn't rock). It's not a sell-out record, either. Carraba is taking this in the direction he feels most comfortable with, it's just a shame that he's an underdeveloped (especially musically) Elliott Smith."
1,I must be too old,"I have a confessional to make: I left this on my dashboard, hoping the sun would melt the case. Greeting card lines coupled with paint-by-numbers melodies fail to stimulate my thinking. ""Hands Down"" is a great song, but the rest sounds like Buddy Holly redux - not his popular stuff, some of his demos."
4,Not the best Chris can do.....,"I was so excited for this CD to come out. I love Dashboard, but they could have done so much better. This CD doesn't compare to the earlier ones except for the exception of a select few.1. Hands Down 8/102. Rapid Hope Loss 9.5/103. As Lovers Go 8/104. Carry This Picture 7.5/105. Bend and Not Break 8/106. Ghost of a Good Thing 9.5/107. Am I Missing 8/108. Morning Calls 7/109. Carve Your Heart Out Yourself 8.5/1010. So Beautiful 8/1011. Hey Girl 8/1012. If You Can't Leave it Be, Might as Well Make it Bleed 7/1013. Several Ways to Die Trying 10/10 *Favorite!*Overall, it's a pretty good CD. Definately worth buying."
5,wonderful,"I bought this album last fall and I have to say by far it's one of the best albums I ahve ever bought. I wasn't that familiar with D/C but over the weeks after buying the CD I was in love with them. The songs are very well written. Chris is a true poet. Even if you've never been one for love songs (like I was), or break up songs, or really Emo altogether, you're sure to love this CD!"
4,Dashboard's new ways,"Ok, I'll get straight to the point, solid album, good songs, a lot of radio friendly songs which isn't bad but just....radio friendly. Good work by dashboard, but they've changed (like every band does) and many people will not like this album just because of that change. There may be one or so acoustic-only songs on this album, which will be a let down to some but a good thing for others. I don't know if I like the change but I'm getting used to it and now I pretty much enjoy this album as much as TPYHCTFTM. But in a way, some of their songs sound like a tamer version of Further Seems Forever, and don't get me wrong, I love Further Seems Forever, it's just different....enjoy the album! awesome work."
5,Dashboard Confessional Is Back!,Dashboard Confessionals Cd A Misson A Mark A Brand A Scaris a big improvent on there last cd the places u have come to fear the most. The Songs are more upbeat than the last cd. Carabbas voice is excellent and the guitars are awesome. This is a very good cd and I am privelaged to be the first to rate it! o and Katie H is the biggest Dashboard FAN!!!!
1,pssh,sry to say to all of you diehard chris carraba fans but his ass was way better in further seems forever. this dashboard confessional crap has to go. NOW. ok bye now all you emokids . maybe you all should write a song how a review about dashboard confessional made you cry.
1,SUCKS,"yeah this is by far the worst dash cd ever. If you want to get dash which i suggest cos they dont suck, except for this cd, go for ""the places you have come to fear the most"" very good cd this one sucks so much ass it makes me want to kill myself or perhaps just james for liking dash so much 311 rules"
3,Dashboard Confessional Review,"Okay i seen the previews for the new Dashboard Cd that was out in stores so i downloaded it..But after watchin the end of the commercial it showed like 5 memembers..So i knew it would sound really weird w/ the drums and stuff..But this new cd isnt that good,i cant get into it,the hands down song from so impossible ep sounds awful..dont get me wrong i love Dashboard,but it sounds more rockish? Maybe i havent given it a chance but i love the old music instead,but their songs are still about relationships and stuff.. so over all i give it 3 out of 5"
4,Solid Album,"This is a very solid album by a good artist/band. This album is not like his older albums. This album is more rock then all of his other albums. There is still some acustic in here but not nearly as much as his older cds. Overall if you are a fan of Dashboard Confessional, pick up this album, just don't expect an album like Swiss Army Romance or The Place you Have Come to Fear Most. Worth buying though."
5,Carraba's at it Again,Dashboard's new cd is amazing. I've been waiting for this to come out ever since I first started listening to the band earlier this year. This new album lived up to my expectations and surpassed them. I couldn't be more happy. Carraba continues to pour his heart and soul into his music and the final product is astonishing.
2,"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar","Well, its definetly Dashboard. This cd is worth a listen. If you like the other dash. stuff then you will seriously enjoy this cd. It was less of the acoustic sound that I had loved on their last two cd's. But the full band plays much more of a part on this cd. The one acoutic song, ""Ghost of a good thing"" is probably one of my favorites. But my favorite would half to be ""am i missing,"" in this song they have a soaring chorus with chris changing out the melody and the harmony. It not the catchest cd. After a few listens i found myself singing along and enjoying every song. So give it a listen, its worth your money."
4,Not Their Best,"Don't get me wrong. I believe that dashboard confessional is one of the best bands out there. chris carrabba's music is the heart-wrenching, cry-yourself-to-sleep kind. but when I first got this cd, I was rather disappointed. The lyrics are still as emotional as always, but they don't have the same impact as there is on their other cds. chris' voice is mellow without the kick it usually has, and they have diluted their sound to mere pop. judging from past work, this cd isn't as ""full"" as it could be. they are capable of much more."
4,FOR THOSE ABOUT TO GO ELECTRIC,"Okay, kiddies, don't go bashing Mr. Carabba for plugging in now. Remember a little soul named Bob Dylan and all the flack he got at Newport Folk for doing the same? Attempting to compare DC's earlier works with this album is silly and futile. I loved ""Swiss Army Romance"" for its sheer purity and that's what made that album great. But this one- with the addition of a full band- is wonderful in a separate way, namely because the addition of electric guitar and drums boosts the emotion of Chris' voice. I don't feel this particular set of songs would work as well acoustically. It might be interesting to hear but the swell of instruments on ""Bend and Not Break"", ""Am I Missing"" and ""Morning Calls"" especially, just makes my chest ache! This is a great DC album, on par with ""Swiss Army Romance"", though different. So take the time to allow your ears the adjustment to some raucous rock instruments and dig on DC's new sound. It's truly beautiful."
5,Best Cd Ever,"I recommend this cd, this is one of the best cd's you can get. I love DAshboard Confessional and I recommend you buy this album!!!"
2,Not Dashboard,This is not Dashboard quality when you put a dashboard cd in yout cd player you expect to hear sad slow accoustic songs. This album is not that at all more electric guitar as well as HAPPY music. some of you might like that but whatever. hope this helps. Not worth buying.
3,OLD dashboard was better,"I am a huge fan of Dashboard and i think chris is AMAZING, but i was definetly dissapointed when i picked up this cd. Dashboard's old stuff was SO amazing, now its turning into wannabe hard-core. I'm still a huge fan, but this album would have been better w/ out the electric guitars. Chris's voice and his guitar skills are amazing, and he should definetly get back to the old stuff. His so impossible EP is amazing and i definetly reccomend it. :)"
3,A mark A Mission,"This is the same dashboard from previous albums, amazing vocals back with good drums. The only new thing that is on this album is that Carrabba seems to use more eletric guitar on this album to give a harder feel to this album, but it mainly adds more texture too it. If you like their previous albums you'll enjoy this"
1,"""Emo"" Kids","As a reviewer stated before, this is not emo, this is basically the mainstream equivalent of emotionless emo... Which would be nothing, which is exactly what I would spend on this album if I were you. I borrowed it from a friend and I felt ripped off since I would never get that time back. Check the other recommendations below for real emo and find out what it's really all about. Chris is a chronic bitcher, not an emotional being. Which would you rather be around? Probably the emotional being, unless you're a dumb high school student who feels they need to jump on the bandwagon of every music scene and listen to the worst possible representative band of any ""genre"" because it's popular. What's popular generally sucks... Think with your head. If you like this, it's not your fault you don't know what good music really is..."
1,Another Bad Review,"What can I say? Emo has became an embarrassment to music in general, but mainly Punk. Seeing as how these little teenie boppers and mall rats have become infestations to deal with that claim to be punk when they have not even the faintest glimpse of what true punk is. It's sickening. Do me a favor and next time you go to the mall, count how many ""punks"" you can see, the total would be somewhere around 50. I say we start a protest against the infidels!To those of you teenie boppers, listen to some real music, like Slayer or perhaps Misfits."
4,relaxing,"I am not into emo stuff whatsoever, and when I listened to this, I didn't think of it being classified as emo. The music is different than what I am used to. It's a slower pace, and the music totally relaxes me. I am glad I got this CD, and I listen to it to get inspired before I write."
3,catchy,"i wasnt blown away with a ""a mark, a mission, a brand, a mission"" but with alot of 5 stars reviews along with a good amount of 1 star reviews (mostly from people who dont own the album) I do think its a solid album filled with many catchy songs with great hooks, but in no way, shape, or form is it genre breaking. Some of the lyrics are interesting and were able to hold my attention, i would reccomend the album, but its not a album that sticks out as a must buy, dont have high expectations if u do purchase the album, i reccomend Bright Eyes ""Lifted..."" instead of this which is truly a brilliant album"
3,A SOLID--NOT EXCEPTIONAL-EFFORT,"This is a good solid effort. It has about five good songs on it by my count:1. Hands down2. Rapid Hope Loss3. Bend And Not Break4. Hey Girl and5. Several Ways To Die TryingThat being said, I can't quite understand all the heat and smoke of praise put around this band. In the big rock universe they are average. There is nothing wrong with that. I can understand why some may like this band a lot. But I have difficulty believing this is someone's very favorite CD.If you like bands such a Vertical Horizon (in other words, essentially acoustic folk music raised to electric instruments), then you will like this CD. If for some reason you find that kind of music ""too tame"", then you should pass on this one."
5,great cd,this is a cd for the types that like to listen to what isnt on the radio alot of original content great cd can listen to over n over go buy this cd hands down is a great song so is ghost of a good thing
2,Is this Dashboard? I guess...,"Well, I can recognize the voice, and I guess the words seem kind of Dashboard-ish, but this whole CD has too much of a punk feel to it- the acoustic guitars have been switched to electric, there's a constant drum and cymbal beat, and the songs seem more geared to be played LOUD than the calm and quiet Dashboard I'm used to. Candidly, I'm disappointed in this CD. They really should have stuck with the tranquil acoustic sounds of the Swiss Army Romance. Oh well."
5,What we've come to expect....AMAZING,"This album is amazing...If you loved his last album you will love A Mark, A Mission, a Brand, A Scar. This album is for all the teens out there."
4,Bob Rivers Does it again and again!,"Being a Bob Rivers enthusiast, I enjoyed this boxed set of Cds. The year in review was a little lame, but the other two disks were the typical Christmas quality!"
4,"""Ho Ho Ho"" Parodies will make you ""Ha Ha Ha""!","Seattle's Bob Rivers and his Twisted crew have gathered the best of their Christmas parodies into one safe place - a 3 CD box set. A great investment for anyone who enjoys the lighter side of life. You will laugh, you will guffaw, you will want to go shopping. Well, maybe not shopping, but you will get a chuckle or two. A wonderful set of music to decorate the plastic tree with."
3,only 2 of the 3 CDs are Christmas,I did not realize that only 2 of the boxed set are Twisted Christmas CDs. The third is 1994 a year in review. I would have prefered all Twisted Christmas CDs other wise i would have purchased them seperatly. The two Christmas ones are great!
5,If you only get one CD - get this one,Bob Rivers - one of the funniest parity singers. These CD's will bring anyone (including stuffed shirts) to their knees laughing. It is all clean - no obscenity - just fun. All the parity songs can be related to by young and old.

4,"ok, but check with MB manufacturer first.","Good price and delivery. Ordered two 1 gig chips. The computer I put them in is 8 years old. Either chip will work in either slot, giving 1 gig of memory, but I could not get both to work together to give a total of 2 gigs. MB Manufacturer said that they had not tested these. Before buying, check with the MB maker if they will work."
3,Well done detachment kit,"They are back with a new line-up and a wider range of sound. A bit like fugazi and cursive with the quirk of Les Savy Fav. PICs:2,5,14. All pretty awsome."
1,Used replacement?,"This replacement product did not work with my Zeno device and, believe that it actually broke the device since it stopped working (i.e. wouldn't even charge) after I swapped the cartrige. I suspect that the replacement was probably used and somehow reset my device such that I can't use it anymore. I would caution against buying replacements over the internet."
5,Worked like a charm!,"I was worried that the refills wouldn't fit my Zeno Pro, since I've never had to replace the tip before, but it worked great!"
5,Excellent!!!!!,"This product has been discontinued at our local stores, so I was happy to find it here. Shipped fast and was at a good price!!"
5,A Time For Dancing Book Review by Amanda,"(...)The author of A Time For Dancing did a very good job of using literary elements to set the mood of the story. She made Julie's situation so real that it was hard not to get teary-eyed while reading what Julie's parents, Samantha, and especially Julie must've been going through.I really enjoyed A Time For Dancing because it was a very heartwarming book that was hard to put down. If anyone would like to read what true friendship is all about, I strongly recommend reading this book that will make you ""turn the pages through your tears."""
5,"Great book, one of the best i've ever read!!!","A Time For Dancing by Davida Wills Hurwin is one of the best books I have ever read. It deals with Juliana and Samantha(Sam and Jules)and Jules's histiocyic lymphoma(A type of cancer). Jules goes through sessions and sessions of chemotherapy, and Sam tries to be right there by her side. These two are totally different, yet totally alike in their own, special two ways. You'll get misty eyed at some parts in the story, and laugh uncontrollably at others. It leaves you with feelings you've never felt before, and you will want to share them with others. This is a lovely novel."
5,a TiMe FoR dAnCiNg ReViEw...,"A Time for Dancing by Davinda Wills Hurwin is SUCh a good book. The author writes about two teenage girls, Samantha and Juliana (a.k.a. Sam and Jules). They are the best of friends and they refer to each other as ""my One and Only."" When Julie is diagnosed with lymphoma (a type of cancer), their friendship is put to the test as they battle Julie's chemotherapy together. They get into fights (not cat fights =D) and don't understand each other. Julie is sick all the time and doesn't go to school, and Sam finds herself a boyfriend and goes to parties she never would have gone without Jules by her side. She even doesn't think about her for hours and only THINKS about calling her...but that changes so thats good =D. I would only recommend this book for teen girls...because of the language and the content. THis book is a WONDERFUL BOOK...BUY IT! This book talks about REAL things..not like all those fiction books like Sweet Valley and BSC.. I was in tears after i finished it.."
5,The best book,"I thought the book was great.I was crying 4 the whole ending ,but it is pretty hard to make me cry during a book and i think people who read this book would also like the author Lurlene McDaniel because she writes books like this.The book really makes you see a different perspective that authors dont usually show because they really dont know how sum1 would feel as a 17 year old who has terminal cancer."
4,A time for dancing....,"This was a very good book. I really liked the ending and how it turned out. It was a really good story of a friendship. It was kind of different, but turned out to be really cool and interesting. This book was sad in places, but a heart felt story.I guess you can never really under-estimate the power of a good friendship. It was sad how they werent as close as before. And it was sad, how the cancer changed the girls and her friends whole life.I never thought that cancer could change you and put you against your friends and family. I hope that I dont get cancer.Overall the book was really good and I recommend it to pretty much everyone. It was a little sad but I think thats what made it such a good book."
5,This book is the best book i have ever read.,"A Time For Dancing is a great book for friends to read. I't not only deals with cancer, but freiendship, guys, and family. I think you should read it!"
5,This story shows feelings and reactions.,This book is the most beautiful story that I personally have ever read. It shows the major feeling about how the best friends felt about this. I think that Julie had a hard time getting through this but she acted as though any other person would have. I think that for Samantha it was especially hard knowing that your best friend could die.Samantha was a big influence on Julie and got her through most of her pain. ( Even though Julie was always upset with her in some way.) I think that Samantha and Julie will always be best friends even with Julie in heaven. Question: When will the sequal come out for A Time For Dancing?
5,BEST BOOK!!!!,"I loved this book. i really felt like i knew sam and juls. i never knew about how amazing a book could be and i really feel that i sam and juls were alive, they could be my best friends"
5,awesome,"This was one of the best books I ever read it was heart touching,shocking,and a wake up call.This book is a reminder to me that you never know what could happen in life or who it could happen to."
5,Exactly as I expected,Delivery was quick and product was in great shape. Loved this book in High School and cannot wait to dance with Jules and Sam (I think) again :)
5,A Time For Dancing,"""A Time For Dancing"" is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a story of two girls (Sam and Jules)who have best friends and danced togehter since they were 9. But they have had a rough spot aloung the way. Jules is diognosed with cancer. In the book it seems like they are both going through it together not just Jules. This book tells about how friends stick through with each other at the worst of times,it showed so many differnet things that could happen in realy life. It is one of the best books I have ever read."
5,A Wonderful Book,Sam and Jules have been dance partners and best friends for years. Then Jules is diagnosed with cancer. This book explores the way this affects each girl and their relationship. It is the best book our mother-daughter book discussion group has read. My one warning is to not read it in front of other people if you would be embarrassed to have them see you cry.
5,WOW,This book was amazing!! I picked it up and couldnt put it down. I loved how it went from Sam telling the story to Julie telling her side of the story. I hope that there is another book about Sam.
5,great product!,was fast deliveryfrom the States to South Africa - it was a gift for my mother's 60th - she got it in time and was very happy with it and its condition - making me look fabulous!! :) thanx. Price was great too! All in all just great service!
5,Nana Mouskouri- Live at Herod Atticus,"I am absolutely thrilled to get this. This is a Christmas present for my sister . I am happy I received it in good condition although it was a little slow. Other than that, I am very very happy."
2,Not in English,I bought as a gift for my husband as he enjoys her on XM radio. Didn't know it wasn't in english.
1,100 Words or Less,"I thought maybe I had a brain hemorrhage. I read, but had no grasp of the scene or characters or plot. Somehow nothing was sticking together.Then I realized it wasn't my poor misused brain. It was the writing style. Salter detests complete sentences. Paragraphs are pieces of observations or memories but strung together as a narrative. This can work beautifully for short scenes. But for page after page it's exhausting. It's annoying. It's incomprehensible.Once in a while comes a writer who is so enamored with technique that the entirety of the novel suffers. Salter is a perfect example."
4,A Pleasure,"Phillip Dean is an American dropout from Yale, living in Paris with several friends. He meets a young woman named Anne-Marie and they immediatley fall in love. Salter's crisp and beautiful novella is forged in the tradition of the erotic novel-drawing on the rich themes of Henry Miller, Salter manages to recast the erotic in the clothes of minimalism. There are sublime moments here of rare beauty-Salter is a master of the minute particular. His descriptions of the quality of light, of landscape, and of city streets make this a profoundly lyrical, and visually stimulating text. A Sport and a Pastime is like a polished gem-a surface without depth, lapidary, and vividly felt."
2,A Sport and A Pastime,"What a disappointment. This book must have been 'naughty' and 'edgy' in its day, but it hasn't aged well. At all. The first person narrative feels forced and the repeated sex scenes are boring and do nothing to further the plot - wait a minute - there is no plot. The only female character is reduced to a cut-out with bad breath and a lovely back. The most developed character is the car. This is watered down Hemingway, except even more two dimesional. The only reason I gave it any stars was that there are some gorgeous descriptions of France that are so true and so real you feel you are there. Except if you were there, you would not want to be within a mile of anyone in this book, but you might want to be in the car .(A least it's a short read.)"
5,A beautifully written book,"I had never heard of James Salter prior to reading an excerpt of his recent memoir, Burning the Days, printed in the New Yorker last fall. I was interested enough by the article to go out and read ""A Sport and a Pastime."" Having read so many good books over the last 20 years, it is rare for me to trip across an author's work in which I think, on every page, migod, this guy is good. I did so with this book. Such a personal and unusual writing style! If you haven't yet read this book (or anything else of Salter's), you have some terrific evenings ahead of you."
2,Grossly overrated,"Having believed the other reviewers, I got this novel - and was very disappointed. If you are a) American, and b) have never been in France, this book may tell you a bit about what France felt like to Americans a few decades ago. If you are keen on that - give it a try. Otherwise - forget it. Thomas Haslwanter"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book and also Last Night based upon the gushing reviews you see above. Who are they kidding? The main character is a cad. It is far from ""a tour de force"" in erotic anything. His short stories in Last Night are only marginally better. Your time is better spent with other authors."
4,A Romance by a great American stylist,Salter is one of the truly great American stylists working today. This book is a romance about an American student and a French shop clerk. It should be required reading for anyone concerned with the craft of fiction. It actually made me care about what happens to Americans in France
3,Easy reading,Characters were believable however I didn't like them so felt removed and unable to empathise.Didn't understand the power of Dean over seemingly intelligent narrator.
4,Dreamlike and vivid,"Beautifully written fugue into small-town French life in the 50's. An intense, vivid and explicit affair. Gets your blood going."
4,"Artful Writing, Classic Erotica","All those who are swooning over Fifty Shades of Gray should read this. It's the real deal, poetic, languid, sensual and set in France.A Sport and a Pastime"
3,A Sport and a Pastime,"I found this book to be a strange 'drifting' kind of book which I found unsettling and at the same time very absorbing. I couldn’t identify with any of the characters, but then I’ve never been one who could live without a regular pay check and tour around Europe on somebody else’s money."
4,Beautifully written,"easy to read, entertaining, quite confronting at times would recommend it to anyone interested in good literature, go buy it"
2,SO SO,I FOUND THIS BOOK GOOD IN PARTS BUT IN OTHERS HARD TO FOLLOW AS IT SKIPPED ABOUT SO MUCH.GOOD DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PLACES HE VISITS THOUGH
2,Salter can do better,"Boy meets girl and they have sex. They have sex a lot. They also drive around France and eat out. Events recorded by third party. Third party does a little socializing himself, but does not partake in the sport. The prose is excellent, but the storyline is deficient, even for a novella. I read S&P after reading James Salter's excellent autobiography ""Burning the Days"". I feel let down."
3,"It's okay for guinea pigs, but...","We recently switched my pets' (gerbils and guinea pigs) Carefresh bedding to Aspen bedding similar to this. The guinea pigs were about the same as before, but the gerbils started to run away whenever they saw anyone, and they weren't fun anymore. Then we switched the gerbils' bedding back to Carefresh and soon they started coming to the cage door when I came into the room. I hadn't even noticed that the Aspen bedding changed this until the gerbils became tamer than before. They aren't as tame as when we first changed back to Carefresh, but they are tamer than when we used Aspen bedding.As for the guinea pigs, they don't seem to mind, but I think they prefer the smaller Aspen shavings to the hard, large ones. I'm not sure which the kind here is.Aspen shavings are fine for guinea pigs, but I'd recommend Carefresh over this for gerbils. (I'm not sure about other rodents, but chinchillas are probably okay with the this kind, too.)"
2,poems and songs which deceives the title,"If you are akin to find out about the mysterious Tom Bomdadil, the half-God that helped Frodo and his friends through the Old Forest and all the way to Bri.... Dont buy this.. Its all just silly songs. I can not understand the purpose of this book. Well.. I think opera and ballett is madness too.."
5,Absolutely wonderful,"Absolutely wonderful. I've listened to this wonderful recording again and again and again and it continues to remain fresh. Along with Barbara Bonney's ""Fairest Isle"", a real desert island disc."
1,I Hate It! I cant get it started!,I hate this product! I am very disapointed that the fish don't grow! The water is the right temperature and the water is clean. I just keep trying and failing. This should not be purchased during the Winter unless you keep your house at 80 degrees.
4,5 and 3 year olds LOVES it!!!,"We got this as a christmas present last year and my sons loved it! We hatched 1 then, put it in storage until this year and we just hatched another batch. Only one survived but babies would have been cool. The plastic is a pain but once the kids realized not to move it, there was no problem. We love it."
1,Hazardous Water,"I will leave the flimsy plastic tank, the need for spring water, extra short lifespan, and very little hatching to the other reviewers. As a preschool teacher the thing that bothered me the most was all of the warnings about the water containing germs. With all the hand washing warnings I first thought that it was for the aquasuars safety...however, it is for your own safety. This was not on the outside of the box, but the instructions warn about water germs over and over again. On top of that, they NEVER let on to what these germs are and how harmful they are....just that you can get real sick. With young kids in my program, they could not touch or really be involved with the project, and it was a waste of money....not to mention another set is out there that sells them under the real name (tri-something) along with what we know best as sea monkeys sorry the real names of both escapes me now)...that set was $12 for both sold at Michaels of all places!"
2,Aquasaurs???,Horrible! We did everything right...TWICE and nothing hatched.My son was terribly disappointed. Don't waste your money!
1,Waste of Time and Money,"My son received this as a Christmas gift. It had to be the worst one ever. After buying the right water, heating lamp and other items, we have yet to be able to ""grow"" these little creatures. Such a waste of time and what a disappointment to kids. Much easier (and cheaper) to buy a fish!"
4,no problem,"My kids, ages 3 and 9, love the aquasaurs and totally understood that they wouldn't last long before we started. Followed the instructions and have eight aquasaurs, four in each tank. Many hatched, but the instruction booklet said ""the bigger ones will eat the smaller ones"". I Don't see why anybody would have any trouble or complaints if they thoroughly read the instructions."
4,Glad we got it!,"My daughter is 9 and she really liked this. The only down side is that the fish do not live long and the tank gets dirty about every 2 to 3 days. I scoop the fish out when I clean it, put them in another container and put them back in when I'm done. We do not use a light, just put them near a window so they get indirect light. We don't buy special water either. We have well water that they seem to like just fine. It's probably the chlorine in tap water that kills them. My daughter was amazed that a fish could hatch from something that had been dry and in a bag. She also thought it cool that they had been around in prehistoric times. It requires some time and maintenance, but I think it's worth it to see the funny little creatures!"
2,YUCK!! and BRING SOME KLEENEX!!,"My 10 yr old was so excited to buy this with her own money. She did everything...set-up, cleaning, feeding...per instructions. We enjoyed approx 60 little white things jetting around, and one little guy who looked like a horseshoe crab. This thing doubled in size almost everyday. It was really cool!HOWEVER, with no filtration system and a flimsy tank, the life expectancy of our little guy was only about two weeks. I went to a *super-store* to buy a real tank and when I got home it had already died. I have 4 kids and they all were crying (ages 10,7,3, 20 mos). I'm sure the unfiltered water poses some health risks to kids as well.So UNCLE MILTON, make a cleaner more sturdy tank and I will buy another one. Til then, we are very disappointed!! 8>("
1,A REAL LET DOWN,"I was so excided to get this for my children, the first step in proving they could handle fish. They set up the tank made sure the water stayed exactly the temp it should be and none of the eggs hatched."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this for my son for Christmas. Only one hatched and lasted a whole 2 weeks then died.
1,aquasaurus,this is one of the most dissappointing items i ever bought for my son. we set up the tank and nothing grew. called the company for money back and they did nothing save your money because you might as well throw it down the toilet if you buy this item. hope i have helped.
2,great idea not so great toy,OK I love the concept of this toy...I bought one for my 11 year old boy and he was so excited to do it he did not read the instructions all the way and added all the food with the baby Dino eggs and i had to pick all the food out so the baby's could still hatch..and they did but the hole thing was a mess because once u add water to it u cant move it because the plastic is so flimsy and u just have to much high maintains for my son maybe if he was older this would of been better? but for sure the flimsy plastic makes this idea suck... we are dealing with live fish hear..overall i think the idea is good for attentive kids but the plastic sucks...
4,Why clean the tank?,"I really don't understand the other reviews of this item. Maybe I misread the instructions, but I did not see anything about cleaning the tank or changing the water. The only caveat was that you need to be careful not to put too much food in the water (which might cause too much algal growth). A number of our aquasaurs hatched and two survived and have grown to about an inch in two weeks. They are interesting looking creatures (very different from brine shrimp) and very active. A little algae has grown on the bottom but it is really no problem. My understanding is that these things evolved to live in puddles, for crying out loud. Leave them alone. Let them live for a few weeks and when they die, throw out the water. My son loves watching them grow and cavort around the tank, and I hope we will get another batch from the remaining eggs."
1,not pleased,"My son used his birthday money for this toy and the eggs never hatched. I e-mailed the company but never heard anything back from them. Also, the tank is very flimsy. Not very pleased with this product..."
2,just ok,It is ok for what I needed but it seems like some one just made a copy onto photo paper rolled it up and called it a poster. It is not the best quality. I don't know if the original posters were more clear or not but this one just is not as nice as I thought it would be.
5,This book ministered to my soul,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. At a time when I though there was no hope, this book provided hope for me. For anyone who needs faith that that special someone will return, I recommend this!"
2,existential angst wrapped in profanity,"Dark humor, dysfunctional kids, dying dad, embarrassing situations, wondering if this is all there is to life and where did I go wrong..I can see the pitch now -- every middle-aged guy in America is going to be able to relate to this and all of the New York critics will love it, but the truth is, despite the great Nicholas Cage, most of us want to go to the movies to escape reality, not have our noses rubbed in it, and the other thing is that the profanity is really excessive and cringeworthy (maybe that's part of the point).While I give the movie some points for unpredictability, it's not really entertaining, it's wallowing for depressives."
1,Tried to keep an open mind...but,"I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I am very open minded to many different kinds of movies, but this just plain sucked."
1,Just Awful,"I suppose that people that are such indepth movie lovers, the ones that remember directors names, movies everyone has been in, etc. might get something technical out of this film. But movies interest me because they are entertaining. A good story. This is neither.It's depressing & full of family misery. Whatever ""artistic"" value is lost on me, and would not recommend it to anyone that is seeking entertainment or simply a good story."
1,A waste of time and money.,"The Weather man is a poorly written travesty of a film. It was truly the worst I have ever seen. The storyline was uninteresting, slow, and repetitive, stretching a fifteen-minute story into a two-hour movie. The dialogue consist of the words ""camel toe,"" ""F***,"" and other nefarious curse words no less than every five minutes. (This is the collective opinion of a survey of 12 people after viewing ""The Weather Man."")"
2,Beyond strange.,"I have seen some strange films in my time but The Weather Man with Nicolas Cage is the weirdest in recent years. Yes the film has funny lines and scenes but the way David (Cage) talks about women's bodies is disturbing. When ever they flashed a breast or anything unnecessary, it made lost interest in the film. Cage is a wonderful and a gifted actor (check-out Leaving Las Vegas instead), but lately he has been in some pointless films in the past several years. He derserves better than these measley roles, heck even Michael Caine derserves better. If you like odd little films then this is for you. It's charming at times but nothing extraoridinary or original here."
5,A Classic,"First off I'm not a kid,I jus would really rather not put my email out, second, whoever gave this movie a low rating must not understand the story very well Nicolas Cage and Michal Caine were brilliant together in this dark comedy about a chicago weather man basically learning to accept himself and confronting his issues, I'm going to make this short and sweet, this is a MUST SEE movie and i would give it more stars if it were on option"
1,A very slow character study,"If you really like ""character study"" movies, you might like this. For my part, I thought that the metaphors (the throwing of objects, the bow & arrow, and others) were labored and had difficulty suspending my disbelief. Furthermore, this is one of the slowest paced movies that I've ever seen. ""Turgid"" is the word that I would use. I didn't like it from the first few scenes and nothing improved my opinion by the end of the movie."
2,"distasteful, crude","My wife and I were able to sit through about two-thirds of this movie. It is relentlessly crude. The viewer is invited to identify with poor David Spritz who is doing his best but is constantly cut down by all of the cardboard, self-absorbed people that surround him. It's an invitation to self-pity and narcissism. No thanks.I did enjoy the scenes of Chicago. Brought back memories of my 7 years there."
1,if you buy this your next purchase will be citalopram.,"i watched this in theaters and was disgusted to say the least. I have depression and this was just plain not even depressing it was flat out boring! Insulting ect.graphic sex scenes, sexual content, slurs, mockery of others, adultery, rape, pedophile, and lack of respect for women are shown in this film. i was not offended by this but the truly lacking storyline i shouldnt be staring at a clock through most of the movie. so cut and dry without any meaning other than ""life is worthless""i do not recommend this unless you want something very very dry filled with all of the above that might push you that last inch towards suicidal actions.basically you stare at one scene for most of the movie. A waste of my time and my meds."
1,Like Fingernails On a Chalkboard,"Cringe-worthy, especially watching Michael Caine explain a ""camel toe"". And what's funny about getting a slurpee thown out a car window at Nicolas Cage's weatherman? The word ""slurpee""? I was watching while on a treadmill to pass the time and boy did that 2 miles drag. I didn't bother to finish watching the movie, 30 minutes was more than enough punishment."
1,Couldn't make it 15 minutes,"What a tedious movie. Also, why do they think that swearing equates with art or ""real life?"" Not Cage's best, its close to his worst...a waste of talent all around. Glad I didn't pay movie theatre prices for this one."
1,Horrible Film,"If you had an enemy and were inclined to try to find a way to get him to commit suicide, you might start by prompting him to watch this depressing piece of garbage. Aside from some nice shots of Chicago, this picture has nothing whatever going for it.Except that is for those who really get off on seeing Nicholas Cage ""in character"" as a morose, angry, depressed,psychotic boring putz, the only role he seems able to fill."
1,My Life Shouldn't Suck like the Weather Man's!,"This has to be the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Now, I may just be an advocate of happy movies, but I like scary and depressing movies too. ""The Weather Man"" is so incredibly awful-- I lost count of the f-bombs while watching the movie, but I believe it would be safe to say that the characters say the word at least fifty times. The entire movie is really random and basically bashes life; the only funny parts were when the... ""hardly skinny"" twelve year-old daughter buys cigarettes instead of a school notebook. Otherwise, ""The Weather Man"" was so awful that I nearly felt like I was on ""Punk'd."""
2,"It should be called ""waiting for the film to come to a point""","I saw the previews for this film and was intrigued. Nicholas Cage is about 50/50 when it comes to good films, but Michael Caine looked like he'd carry the story in the previews. I couldn't have been more wrong.Cage is a conflicted character, clearly he's unhappy. He's a bad father and his children and ex-wife are evidence of that as well. The preview made it look like a father-son film about being a better father and better man. For every step forward Cage takes, he takes at least two backwards.The sad part is through all of this conflict, there was a tremendous potential for the character to grow, but that never happens. At the end of the movie you are simply left with a feeling that a point should have been made but never was."
2,SOMEBODY SHOOT THE WRITERS!!!,"There are no words to describe how slow and AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film deals with a ""weather man"" from Chicago whose job provides him with a comfortable, if not fulfilling, life. As for his family life, that's just miserable...The presence of Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine did very little to alleviate the pain felt while watching this abomination.The plot, the dialogues, and the music are way beyond ""below average.""With the exception of the ""little"" girl who is crying out to be made fun of, and the brief nude scene, everything else is horrendous!In conclusion, the potential for a decent movie was there if only the writers had the ability to... write! A shame really...Rent or buy at your own risk. You have been warned! 1 1/2 Stars"
4,What's the Nipper?,"A funny, interesting and ultimately melancholy look into the soul of a man who is lost and overwhelmed. Cage plays Dave Spritz, a divorced Chicago weather man struggling to make peace with how he fits into the lives of those around him. He wants to be a good son, father, husband and career man. But his misguided efforts are often futile at best, and destructive at worst. The film speaks volumes about the complicated challenges we all face in successfully filling the diffrent roles in our own lives. We all can't be Pulitzer Prize winners after all and that's OK. Great performances from Cage and Caine. Don't expect a tidy bow on this one however. The Weather Man is more about the journey than the destination."
3,Only 3 stars because the film was too slow-moving until near the end,"I would definitely recommend this film though. I think that the acting, casting and screenplay were all very good.I can maybe guess that the film was so slow-moving because the main character was supposed to be depressed? But the main character was intelligent so the slowness wasn't plausible."
1,"SAD, VERY SAD","THIS IS HOLLYWEIRD'S IDEA OF WHAT LIFE IS LIKE. THE PROTAGONIST IS IRREDEEMABLY SHALLOW, SELFISH AND CLUELESS. HIS LOST FAMILY IS ONE ONLY HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVE COULD RECOGNIZE. CAGE WASN'T EVEN LIKABLE IN THIS ONE. THE FILM WAS VERY 'LITERARY' IN THAT IT WAS ALL FLASHBACK AND THE 'HERO' WAS AN IDIOT, SO THE LITERATI WILL LOVE IT. BUT IF YOU SEEK FILMS WITH PROTAGONISTS YOU CAN IDENTIFY WITH, AVOID THIS ABORTION."
2,"The Weatherman review: Chance of clouds, rain, snow, sleet, Aka, Bad Weatehrman movie.","Really?Are you serious?Unless your really bored and cleaning your house because its sleeting outside, dont bother watching this movie.I enjoy watching the rain at not better when I cant see it than seeing this movie.Enjoy."
1,What a Joke... Grow Up!,"This movie was pathetic in every sense of the word. Even beyond the insistence that we care about a shallow guy who is just unlikable in every way, the movie's need for sophomorish, locker room language and references is ridiculous. From explaining 'camel toe' to a the constant f-bombs, and Cage's sexual fantasies, I get a since I am at a 10th grade slumber party, not watching what is supposed to be some deep movie.Cage can act but he couldn't save it. Grow up...this movie is the personification of 'immaturity'.A waste of celluloid, tape and DVD disc material."
1,Drab.. negative and boring.... A Hollywood Introspective ?,"This film seems to be the ultimate expression of ""artsy fartsy"" film-making.I assume this was a film made in Hollywood by Hollywood and about Hollywood for them to self-diagnose and poke fun at their own negativity, liberal bias, shallow existences and sad state of affairs today.To anyone else watching it, you will probably hit the ""eject"" button after 30-40 minutes and ask ... ""Why would anyone waste the time, energy and effort to put together crap like this ?""Time is to short to waste on people who are perpetually negative and hate themselves as not only the characters but apparently the makers of this film are themselves."
2,Didn't really Care for this Movie,"Just finsihed Watching The Weatherman. I'm not going to say any of the plot, just writing a impression. The movie has a different feel than the movie trailer conveys. It's kinda dark and dreary, with dreary electric piano music throughout the whole movie. The movie makes it's dreary repetitious points. I wanted my money back at the video store. The clerk at the store was amazed I watched the entire movie. He said he turned it off after the first 20 minutes. It really is THAT BAD! Don't say I didn't warn ya!"
3,"I liked it, but it is Rental Quality","First of all I did like this movie. Its not sugary sweet and favors realism over ""and they lived happily ever after"". It is not really a funny movie...I felt part of the time that I hated the main character and after awhile I found I liked him. He meant well, he just could not articulate his feelings and was pretty poor at accepting reality. His responses to reality to me were linked with him being hit by the various articles of fast food throughout the movie. Life does throw stuff at you. Alot of it is undeserved..but you deal with it..and learn to duck!Its not a great movie its pretty toned down and is a character study. The biggest action here is some pretty poor archery. Good performances by most of the actors. It is not really uplifting and you won't have a spring in your step when it ends, but it is a slice of life. Five of us watched it, 2 hated it, 3 of us liked it, but none of us would watch it again, thus the ""rental quality"" in my review title."
1,Big disappointment,"This is a really bad movie, that's why it flopped. Cage whines through the whole movie and plays a sad rich boy. They were trying for a Lost In Translation type of film, but missed."
1,Save your money!,"I am a huge Nick Cage fan...but unless you enjoy watching a painfully inept loser---surrounded by other equally unappealing losers--muddle through life whining about just about everything, you are going to hate this one.Misrepresented as a comedy in TV adds and previews, it is about as far from anything ""fun"" as you can get....filled with profanity, eccentric behavior, implausible events, and a relentless cloud of failure over the protagonist.I should have been tipped off by the ""bow over the shoulder business""...my bad.People were walking out...I wish I had joined them."
3,Lots of Swearing,"Again, I am not a fan of Nick Cage, so please keep that in mind. The overall tone of this movie is dry (sometimes depressing) for the most part, but still has its moments and has some good laughs too. But everything about it just seems so bland, which I think is part of the movie's intention. Michael Caine has an American accent that just doesn't seem right for someone who is so profoundly British. The movie does have a rich vocabulary of cussing and slang terms which I found to be very entertaining, especially concerning Cage's daughter in the movie. You might like this movie, you might not."
2,I tried to like it...,it does have some real life spots in it that made it funny. Those are few and far between though. A weatherman that is contemplating his life and trying to be a better parent.
4,Refreshingly Original,"The Bottom Line:A quietly interesting drama with some moments of laugh-out-loud humor and good performances by Cage and Caine, The Weather Man is valuable most of all because it's just so different than your standard Hollywood film: it can't really be categorized aside from ""drama"" and I haven't seen any real comparable films.3/4"
3,Desperately Seeking Sunshine,"""The Weather Man"" is mostly cloudy, with patchy insights. Sudden bolts of tastelessness and profanity cause a rapid drop in overall outlook, creating a dismal forecast. And viewing the DVD extras is like asking the Chief Meteorologist to confirm why this is so: the writers/directors/producers involved in ""The Weather Man"" are all full of themselves, and not nearly as clever as they like to believe. Still, I've seen worse (haven't we all; *sigh*). As disasters go, at least this one isn't on the order of the magnitude of a ""Katrina"" or suchlike. But viewers looking for a breath of fresh air won't find it here."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I had hoped for a film that would be entertaining and perhaps even ""funny""--mistaken!!The acting by Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine was excellent but the story (writing) was a waste of time watching and a waste of production money.Buy only if you are not expecting much."
3,The Weather Man,"Nicolas Cage plays a divorced man who tries to connect with his Pulitzer-Prize-winning father, his ex-wife, and his children. His daughter wants to take up archery, so he accompanies her to the archery range, buys her equipment, pays for lessons, only to watch her lose interest. His son is in a drug rehab program, but has problems with one of his counselors. Cage is in the middle of all of this angst and nothing seems to work for him. He is a finalist for the weather man's job on a network morning show in New York, but even that pales when he realizes that his weather forecasting is done with the help of a meteorologist and without much skill on his part. There must be a point to all of this and I kept looking for it as I watched the film. Unforunately, I never really found it."
1,Did these people read the script...,"before agreeing to appear in this nauseating mess? I've always been a huge fan or Caine & Cage for many years & this has to be the worst film either has ever appeared in. Especially embarrassing for Michael Caine who is so ill-suited to the part he plays & then has to spout garbage his own character pretends not to comprehend. So which one comes off as the bigger hypocrite.I know, they're only actors & they need all that money & fame.This movie tries to be one more essay into the dysfunctional suburban family trope & wins hands down as the most abysmal."
4,Good Insight to the 1991 series!,"Since I really liked the 1991 series and marched unsuccessfully in front of NBC to keep it going, this book was a must-have for me. It is written by Jim Pierson who worked on the series and who happens to be one of the nicest guys you will meet. This series was hampered by the first Gulf War and, like Star Trek, relegated to a dead Friday Night timeslot which killed its ratings. The cast was first class (Ben Cross, Barbara Steele, Roy Thines) and it seemed to be a huge upgrade over the poor special effects of the original soap. The series ended in an unresolved cliff-hanger as Victoria Winters returned from the past to present-day Collinwood and gave Barnabas a look like she knew who he really was."
3,Not quit what I was looking for,"I saw Dark Shadows Resurrected the movie on cable the other weekend and just had to order this book. I couldn't tear my eyes away from the tv. Well, I was thinking that this was the movie in book form.It isn't. It does have allot of good pictures of the episodes and it describes every episode. Great if you want a book descibing the episodes."
2,to small,the jewelery is very nice but to small for my nipple..so far I can only where bars with decoration haning frm it
4,For the love of horses,"I was considering this video as a present for a 14 year old girl who loves horses and I think it will be just the thing for her. I was worried that the content and narrative might be too sophisticated or just not interesting to her, but I don't think it'll be a big problem. The video was definitely made for adults, but I believe teenagers will enjoy the video as well, especially since the cinematography is so good. The horses are beautiful and beautifully filmed.There is a lot of history about the horse, but the emphasis of the video is definitely on the horse's place, uses and problems in modern day society. Even someone who knows a lot about horses will learn from and enjoy this video, I know I did!!"
4,interesting education movie,great movie! showed the history of the horse and how many exciting different breeds are out there. also how the horses were tamed and treated in the first place.
5,Excellent puzzler,This puzzle is just plain fun. I am a fan of King Tut and most things Egypt and the gold metallic and other bright colors have kept me well entertained doing this puzzle. This is not an easy puzzle and requires some imaginative thinking to finish.
3,If you are a true soccer fun and know soccer Judge fairly,"For those of you who are confused about the game of soccer, you need a reality check. As we all know Soccer is a team sport supported by the whole team and one or few great star , and Pele Was always the team and that great star. For those of you who never had a chance to watch Pele play, watch some video before you try to compare him with Maradona or anybody. Not taking anytinge from Maradona, Pele knew how to play the team sport as a team player and a leader. Most of all he knew how to take care of him-self and his fun. Only God is God, but Pele is the greatest soccer player who ever came to this world. Yes ""GOD"" sent us Pele as his own ""REPLICA"" (A copy or reproduction of a work of art, especially one made by the original artist)."
4,the General,"Coming from a nation, where fotball is 4th in the lader of national sport, one must not dwell in the politics of his personal life, being a sport fan one must acknowlege his skills, touch, but most important the way he could read the feild and most important the opposition. Formula 1 had Nelson, Tenis had Borg , Basketball had Jordan and fotball had Maradona. And to all those English Man, the hand of God inccident was true Professionalism at that moment, this is what i think went through his mind. If i get booked i'm done,but if i don't i'm a hero. So England for your own Fotball futur , do not dwell in the past, you lost a superior player that ripped the team in half with that magical second goal, that even your keeper could not stop."
3,"Soccer fans, read this review","I'd recomend you, soccer fans that still have doubts about which was the greatest soccer player of all times, to go spend a few hours watching some videos. I did. In fact I made a little ""research"" on the subject. And let me tell you Maradona's talent has no comparison with any other soccer player in history. Not only that he was incredibly skillfull and did amaizing things with the ball, but sometimes he seemed to be 1 or 2 seconds ""ahead"" of the rest.Maradona was... a soccer artist.As Platini said..... ""Zidane is the best soccer player nowadays, but what he does with a soccer ball, Maradona can do with an orange""Dont waste money on this book... go buy a few videos so you can see the best soccer player of all times in action"
1,What a BS Book,"Lets be clear about one thing: Maradona IS god, and Pele only a shadow. He was not the best player of the 80's but the best player in the history of the game. Who writes this? Peter, London UK."
5,FAB STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"The world's renown tenor and Spain's best loved Diva join forces in this superb CD, recorded live in Miami. ""Elegance"" does not begin to describe this spectacular compilation of tunes, a journey of these two ""madrileños"" from ""Granada"" to ""New York, New York"". San Basilio's rendition of: ""No llores por mí Argentina"" is the most soulful version of them all. Boleros like ""El día que me quieras"", ""Bésame mucho"", ""Solamente una vez"" are simply too good to miss. A timeless classic from Spanish legends Domingo-San Basilio."
1,Disappointing,"The sound quality on this CD is so poor that I could not enjoy it. I know it was recorded live, but I've heard excellent live recordings. There's no excuse for this."
4,Good fun at Christmas...,"This holiday parody collection has a few masterpieces on it which more than make up for a dated clunker or two. ""The Chimney Song"", also known as ""Santa's stuck up in the chimney"" is worth the purchase price all by itself if you have a kid between the ages of eight and 13. Also fine are ""Twelve Pains of Christmas"" and ""Wreck the Malls"" and ""The Restroom Door Said 'Gentlemen' and ""I'm Dressing Up Like Santa When I Get Out on Parole."" The misfires include a Jack Nicholson-sound-alike recitation and ""Come All Ye Faithful Dead-heads"". If you like this sort of thing, also consider buying from Amazon Dave Rudolf's ""Completely Cracked Christmas."" That one's as good as this, and also has a stuck-in-the-fireplace Santa song, coincidentally. Both of them work for temporarily relieving the stress of shopping, traffic and other holiday burdens."
4,Funny,"Twisted Christmas by Bob Rivers Comedy Corp cassette is twenty-four minutes and forty-seven seconds long and released on September 8, 1992. There are some laughs on this cassette. When he does his version of the Twelve Pains of Christmas; and believe me they are painful ones: stringing up the lights, meeting my in-laws and five months of bills. Ouch. Other good songs are: Wreck The Malls, O Come All Ye Greatful Dead Heads, and The Restroom Door Said, ""Gentlemen."" If you want some fun for Christmas, then buy this cassette. Twisted Christmas by Bob Rivers Comedy Corp get a B.Side 1Twelve minutes and fifty eight secondsThe Twelve Pains of ChristmasThe Chimney SongWe Wish You Weren't Living With UsWreck the MallsA Visit From St. NicholsonSide 2Eleven minutes and forty-nine secondsO Come All Ye Grateful Dead-HeadsI'm Dressin' Up Like Santa (When I Get Out On Parole)The Restroom Door Said, ""Gentlemen""ForeignersJoy to the WorldA Message From the King"
5,"One light goes out, they all go out!!","Who doesn't love Twisted Christmas? The 12 Pains of Christmas is the best song on the album, but the others are all pretty good too. Well worth the money for a little holiday humor :)"
5,Twised Comedy,"""Twisted Christmas"" CD is very funny and since laughter IS the best medicine go for it! For those without a great sense of humor you probably won't appreciate this CD."
4,Very funny holiday selections,"This is a good disc if you're looking for something unusual and humorous for your holiday listening pleasure. The 12 Pains of Christmas describes things that most of us have experienced at one time or another (You're so smart, YOU rig up the lights). A Visit From St. Nicholson, Wreck the Malls and The Restroom Door Said Gentlemen are also favorite cuts of mine. Done in the tradition of Spike Jones and Stan Freberg. If you want to put Christmas humor in your holidays, get this disc."
5,Utterly Hilarious,"Man, even after all this time, when my brother originally got the tape, it still makes me laugh a ton. To put it simple, I am a Christian, but I hate most all Christmas carols with a passion, I mean the mainstream ones like ""Jingle Bells"", ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", among others that I am sure you will all recognize. Hence why I always find all parodies of these songs to be priceless. This is no exception, a very 80's-ish sound them, but that's fine because these are timeless. My favorite song on this CD? ""The Restroom Door Said Gentlemen"", which makes fun of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"", absolutely priceless in my books. I could not stop laughing first time I heard it, and it still makes me laugh to this day. My suggestion to you all, is to get this CD and check it out."
3,"Fair, but a little juvinile","The parodies remind me of a couple of junior high boys trying to be funny with the songs. Mediocre rhyming and lame jokes. They got better for ""more Twisted Christmas"""
4,Difficulty With Order,"The CD itself was great. It is a fun CD and we enjoyed it. However, I accidently order the same item twice. I tried and tried to cancel the second order but could not get the cancellation to go through. So I ended up receiving and paying for an extra order I did not want."
4,Great Laughs With This Holiday Satire,"My own favorites are of course the opening cut The Twelve Pains Of Christmas along with We Wish You Weren't Living With Us, The Restroom Door Said Gentlemen & the surprisingly good rockin' Wreck The Malls. Except for a clunker or 2, you'll laugh along with this one & want to listen to it long after the holidays are over. Highly recommended."
2,twisted christmas,not as good as the chipmunk one i liked it much better i was hopping for more from this cd
4,Lost serial fragments reclaimed,"This is a very good compilation of surviving fragments of our motion picture past. An excellent restoration, with appropriate backgound music."
1,Definitely NOT a Soundtrack,"i am a major MSCL fan, have been ever since the first time i accidentally clicked on the TV and saw it for the first time. However, the soundtrack was a complete and utter disappointment. All of the songs that caught my attention in watching the show seem to be the ones missing from the soundtrack. The reason I purchased the CD was because of those songs and now I own a CD i wish i never bought. Overall, i think its just not worth it, make your own soundtrack by downloading all of the songs yourself, save your money."
3,it was ok but i have one problem:,"i am in love the song that played at the end of the boiler room episode, any loyal watcher know what i m talking about, it is by buffalo to m but does not appear on the album. i have been surching for this song for years if anyone has any info please contact me at mxpx1145@aol.com, it will be greatly appreciated. thank you"
3,missing the Good Buffalo Tom song!!!!!!,i love my so called life and i miss the show a lot. i agree with the critic on this page who wrote before me that they the soundtrack should have that buffalo tom song at the end of the boiler room episode. That song is awesome!!!!! i love it and have now way of finding it cuz it is not on the soundtrack.
3,Was this the only cd they made?,"there was so much music on the show. i remember how they played all the music that was hot back then. it was one of the many good things about the show. with that and the characters it brings me back to when i was 15. to think how lucky i was when i was 15 to have characters on a really good show that were at the same spot in life as me seeing that they were 15 years old and some were misfits like myself. wish theyd bring it back on tv for kids today. there arent shows like that anymore nor is there music..one thing i was wondering though..Question: on so-called angels there was the angel/homeless girl who was singing.is that juliet hatfield doing a voice over and is it on this album or who is it, i love that song."
3,So-called-soundtrack!,"I really liked the music on this album, especially 'Make it Home' by Juliana Hatfield...I love having the theme music to the show too! My only three complaints are that 'Red', 'I wanna be sedated' and 'Late at night' aren't on it - these three songs were major songs in the tv series and were the original reason I bought the album (not knowing who the songs were by at the time). Does anyone agree with my complaints???"
3,Dissapointing,I really think that a few more songs more to do with the tv show should have been added.....
2,so-called letdown,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one who's disgusted with this cd's tracklisting. I watch my MSCL tapes over and over, in no small part due to Snuffy's *amazing* episode scores, and I just can't believe none of this music is available on CD. It's a travesty. If anyone hears of a Snuffy collection CD, please let me know. I've been listening to my 'thirtysomething' CD nonstop."
3,Almost complete,"I love this show. I bought the DVD collection when it came out. There are some really great episodes. The soundtrack would have been complete if the 'Late at night' song would have been on it. I have been searching for a certain song for a long time. I have no idea what it is called, but it has the words 'release me' and it plays on the dance episode when Angela and Jordan are outside and Brian comes out and sees them together. Then the song 'What is love' comes on right afterwards and kinda drowns it out. (...)"
2,So disappointing!,"This is one of the greatest shows ever on television that I even recorded all the episodes and still watch it today! I wish it would come back. So curious to know what ""would have"" happened between Brian and Angela. I also wish the soundtrack could've been better. Many great songs from the show are missing, especially the memorable ones like R.E.M's ""Everybody Hurts"", Enigma's ""Return to Innocence"", and among others mentioned by others (Sedated, Blister in the Sun, Red, Late at night, What is love). I might as well download these songs and create my own soundtrack! I sure miss the show..."
2,missing key songs,"If youre a fan of the whole genre of MSCL then you'll enjoy this cd, but as previously stated important songs in the series failed to make it onto the cd. Such songs are ""Late at Night"" by Buffalo Tom, which is the song in the famous hand holding scene. Some of the songs on this cd were actually in the show such as 1,2 and the theme song. but if your looking for red, the song jared leto sings in why jordan cant read u can skip this cd and download it off the internet. Overall if youre a diehard fan of MSCL i recommend it but if youre not skip it."
3,A teenage fan,"O.K., I started watching MSCL a year ago-reruns. I wasn't alive when the show first came on, but I fell in love with it, it was the first-and only-show that amazed me. The script was spectacular, the actors amazing, and the music was to die for!No show will ever be able to top this one! I was heartbroken when I learned that the show had been canceled, and when I found out there was a cd, it brought my hopes up again! I soon realized the truth, all the really amazing songs, like ""Red"", and ""Blister In The Sun"", weren't on the cd! i was so suprized! And ""What is Love"" from the episode Life of Brian (my favorite episode, Brian-I love you!) wasn't there either! If You are a MSCL fanatic, make sure you read these reviews! (P.S.-Person who wrote the review about adding actual lines from the show in the cd, you are so right!That would have been great!)"
3,What!?!,"I LOVE MSCL but this soundtrack is a real bummer because the 2 reasons i watch the show are the clothes and the music but they left out a most of the good songs like ""red"", ""i wanna be sedated"" and ""blister in the sun""(my favorite part of the whole series is where she was dancing to that song). what i ended up doing was buying this cd and adding the songs i felt were missing."
3,More early series background music than memorable show music,"Most of these songs were songs in the background than really important songs. Really wish they had Jared singing ""Red"" and ""Sedated"" on this CD, and less of songs I've never heard of."
4,Variety galore!,"Although I much prefer their more recent music, this comprehensive compilation shows you how the band evolves and the different sounds which have been added.Maybe not the ideal choice for a salsa dj, but great if you like latin music(esp. Afro-cuban sounds)."
2,Disappointed -,"The story is cute no doubt, but I was disappointed in the content. The story does nothing to teach a child WHY it is wrong to lie. It merely gives a scenario of what happened in this particular situation with this particular child. The little girl in Pinky Promise felt guilty about telling a lie and she confessed on her own, but there are a number of children who lie as easily as they breathe and they feel no remorse for it. This book will teach nothing to children like that.I actually felt cheated out of my $7.95 - I will continue to look for a book that does a better job of explaining why it is morally wrong to lie to other people."
5,Perfect for Emergencies!,"In the early days of my culinary training, I encountered practically every ""disaster"" known to cooks! Although I have made improvements, I still keep this book always close by. Every cook, regardless of skill or talent, knows the frustration of something going wrong. This book will show readers not only how to repair and salvage the food but also how to best avoid potential disasters. A copy of this book should be in every kitchen!"
3,Just barely 3 stars,"I have to agree with the other reviews on this one, I have a couple other Mammoth Books of Best New Horror and they are much better than this one. I am glad I got it used for just a couple bucks, I would have been much more disappointed if I had paid full price for it. A handful of good stories, and I would hardly categorize those few as scary. Really mostly filler."
3,Some Decent Stuff Here,C'mon guys be nice. It isn't that bad. While I agree the tales are less scary than weird (criticism deserved but that's horror anthologies for you) there are a couple of stories worth mentioning. You're illiterate if you aren't taken in by The Goat Cutter. Not only is it creepy but the prose is so well done I consider this literature. The Bereavement Photographer may not scare you but again it's so well written you'll probably read the whole thing anyway.I'm half way through and hoping for at least one more banger. Let's stay realistic.
3,Buy it used,Like most anthologies 5 good stories 2 or 3 bad ones and the rest are nothing more than mediocre filler .
2,Not impressed by any means,"Ok, I like to be scared. I like good ol' traditional scary stuff! This book was just (for the most part) weird! The tales were weird, the author comments were weird, and most of the stories were pathetic. I mean, some of them were definitely worth the read, but it's not worth the fifteen bucks this book costs. Used, five bucks, MAYBE, but I would strongly suggest spending your money elsewhere--I'll let you know when I run across an anthology worth fifteen bucks, but it isn't this one."
1,Misleading,"Maybe these recipes work in Denver? I now notice the positive review is from Seattle!!!I have had no success with the baking recipes at 6,500 ft and higher, and havent tried them at lower altitudes. The other dishes I've tried did not produce inspired cuisine.My copy is now available at the used bookstore."
2,Big disappointment,"This book was a big disappointment. I'm sorry I bought it, and I'm not keeping it. HIGH ALTITUDE BAKING (Colorado Extension Service) and PIE IN THE SKY (Susan Purdy) cookbooks are much better."
4,the new high altitude cookbook,i enjoyed going through and changing some of my recipes to the high altitude recipes. no pictures and i love pictures.
4,Very good album,"Neal McCoy is a real underated entertainer. This 1995 album contains some great songs. ""For a Change"" and ""They're playin' our song"" were big hits and are two of my favourites. This album is a good mix of ballads and up-tempo songs. ""Plain Jane"" is a fun danceable song. I recommend this album to all country lovers."
5,Highly recommend for young and new leaders,"Some of the best lessons on leadership are lessons learned through experience. In this book, one of the most influential preachers, Charles Spurgeon, recounts lessons he has learned on leadership. With great illustrations, moments of humility, and loving exhortations he gives needed advice to the next generations of leaders.One of my tendencies when thinking about leadership is to think of leading as getting others and myself from point A to point B. Not that there is anything wrong with that; it is just too simplistic a view of leadership. If leadership is only about competency, does the character or beliefs with which it is done have no value? In Charles Spurgeon's view, it is not only the method but also the manner that is crucial to leadership.For a full book review see my blog. [...]"
1,choker,First of all it does not fit unless you have a huge neck scond it is sooo cheaply made I could of gone to the fabric store and made a hundred of them for the price I paid for this. I through it in the trash was'nt even worth the price in shipping to send it back.
2,Pretty...Pretty HUGE!,"This choker is not very 'choking', it is very very large. I bought it to accessorize with my vampire Halloween costume and it was way too big. I'm not sure why it's so big, but it needs to be safety pinned in the back. I ended up not even wearing it. It is pretty though."
3,Don't be too rough.,This was definitely big. Would be nice if there was a way to adjust the size so it fit correctly. The gem fell off right after I put the choker on and bumped it.
2,Not the best,"Failing to read the review, I bought this Percy Faith CD thinking it was an instrumental. Needless to say, I'm a little disappointed."
4,Good book so far,I bought this book to study for the AOBFP boards (initial certification). I'm on Chapter 3 but so far it seems like a good review. The text is easy to understand and the questions at the end of each chapter are relevant to the covered material.
5,A partial solution to using CFL's,The fan is exceptionally quiet and very powerful. The only major drawback is that people have not been able to get it to work with CFL's. I was able to figure out a partial solution for me. The fan has a wattage limiter that prevents you from exceeding 190 watts. Yet CFL's that were far under this limit would not work. It occurred to me that the fan may need a minimum wattage of 100 watts to work e.g. four 25 watt bulbs would give. So I inserted 3 candelabra CFL's of 14 watts each giving me the equivalent of 60 X 3 (180 watts incandescent) plus one 60 watt candelabra incandescent. IT WORKED! My total actual wattage was 3X14=42 plus 60 for a total of 102 watts. My light equivalence is 240 watts. By the way the candelabra CFL's was 65K daylight bulbs making a very bright light suitable for reading. No I don't try to dim the CFL as they are not dimmable. This has worked for about three week without mishap.
5,Love My Headset,"I use it all the time, its easy to use and it folds nicely it has lasted for many years."
2,Garbage,"The sound quality was ok when I held these against my ears, but they otherwise did not sit tightly enough and sounded awful. It is plausible that these would sound ok to someone whose head is shaped differently. I tried a pair of these and found them to be uncomfortable, and the manufacturing appeared to have been of extraordinarily low quality.I recommend these:JVC HAS150BX Light weight Flat Folding Headphone (Black)I've also used this Sony pair:Sony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones with Reversible Earcupsalthough the joints are somewhat fragile."
1,Don't Fit - NOT Worth ANY AMOUNT of $$,"Sleek looking but non-conforming to the head, They just DON'T fit your head properly, since the ear pieces only adjust in one direction. Maybe because they are collapseable is the reason for thier limitation."
1,these are pieces of crap..,"i just bought these in january here it is june and they popped about a month ago. static for bass, i paid [...]at target and i admit that its not a great sum but still there should be a bettr buy than this. i hate the sony brand, but it looks like i'll be buying them again soon. oh yea, the silver and grey is turning like a brownish yellow, wtf??"
4,Relatively good headphones,"I have owned these headphones for about 1 year and 2 months. The right side started giving out a couple weeks ago, so I bought another pair.These are nice headphone for the price. The sound quality is good. They are also comfortable on my ears, not too tight with adequate padding.I like to keep a pair of headphones at work and with these, I don't have to worry about them being stolen. I use a nicer pair of headphones at home, but if you are looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones where you won't care too much if they break, are lost, or stolen, these are the perfect pair."
3,Overall sound good for the price.,"For around ten bucks, these headphones sound good, are probably better than the cheap low-quality ear buds that came with your MP3 player or phone, and are a good value. However, if you truly want much 'higher end' sound that will enable you to hear every nuance and detail in your music (with much improved bass), and that will 'knock your socks off', check out slightly more expensive quality models like the 'AKG K26P' or 'AKG K27i' or the 'Sennheiser PX-100' or 'PX-100W' cans (headphones). You won't believe how great music can sound on your portable player spending just 30 to 50 bucks on better 'cans'!"
5,Low price great sound,"My first pair lasted a few yrs of hard use, so I just orderd 2 pairs. If u hav an MP3 player throw away the ear buds and get these. Good base, good rich sound and loud. Very comfortable I can wear them all day at work, and they stay on my head wen I bend over. If ur on an airplane their more than adequate, sound better than my $50 Aiwa noise canceling headphones. Update: 11-1-10 These bad boys are still kicken even after 3 extended trips overseas. And looking at the date I have had this last pair for 4 years now. I was going to purchase a few more for spares and gifts but now it seems they have more than doubled in price. The price seems to be flucuating. I still think they are a great set of head phones. I also have some $40 over the ear Phillips headphones that sound a little better, but they make my ears sweat and are too tight, but for portability, lightweight comfort and durability I reccomend these units. Maybe the price will drop again."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought these for my daughter after she received an iPod for Christmas. She liked that they could be folded and put in her purse when not in use. However just a little less then a month after buying them it started to lose sound in the right side. We thought it was just a fluke and returned them to Target on 2/11 and replaced them with the same thing. Well here it is March 2 and it's already done it again. We're taking them back tomorrow and getting something totally different. I would skip these entirely, they're not worth the headache."
3,Interesting read but methodologically unconvincing,"The problem with this approach is the simple assumption that a commodity enjoys demand depending on what age group it appeals to, and what is the percentage of this group within a country's population overall.That is exactly the main argument of the author: show me the population trends, birth rates, percentage of age groups, and I will tell you what's going to be in demand.This assumption needs to be defended more thoroughly, however. Education is a good example. Although birth rates declined in the US for the last 20 years, more people get university education today compared to the past. Obviously, the economy of the 21st century demands that.Growth or decline rates of the population cannot be the only major independent variable predicting demand."
1,Dissappointed in the Blu-Ray Messiah,"The DVD really is schitzophrenic. Turn off the video, it seemed to be a good performance with respect to the orchestra and soloists. Turn on video and what I saw in the stage production was disturbing and completely disjoint from what the traditional Messiah tries to convey. I wish I had more of a clue that this was the case before purchase and it would have sent me elsewhere looking for an authentic and good Handle's Messiah performance, this is not it.If you want an avant-guard strange interpretation of Messiah, go for it. My guess is that the glowing reports that took me came from the staff of the production. Sombody has to love it. Not me though."
2,Sacred turned profane,"Review of Handel's Messiah (Blu Ray)I have owned several recordings of Handel's Messiah starting with an LP (Vinyl discs) recording through cassette tape, CD and DVD. Recently my son purchased this Blu-Ray version from Amazon and gave it to me for my birthday.I was very disappointed. To me this is a sacred oratorio, but to my mind what I saw was vulgar.Even in the parts that were not vulgar, the acting was distracting so you could not concentrate on the meaning of the lyrics.I gave it 2 stars because the singing itself was good. This recording should be heard but not seen! I will not recommend it to anyone.If you are buying this oratorio for the first time get the 250th performance version (ASIN: B0000AKGUW).Elisha Tikasingh"
4,Amazing is right,"I gave this program 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I have not seen it on DVD-only watched it and DVR-ed on NatGeo. However,I have watched it at least once a week since I recorded it. Gorgeous visuals from Hubble and interesting science. Hope it looks as good on the DVD-R from Amazon."
3,Good Game But...,This game is a lot of fun. Combines puzzles and a little strategy. Does not run under windows XP even if you change the compatability mode.
3,Great but too small!,"The carrier I got was a little different than pictured, better actually. The top was different, it was actually caged on top so the animal could fit in through the top and it was very nice. I just wish it was bigger!! Definatley not for a 15 pound dog. Perfect for a cat or kittens! I actually sold it to someone with cats. I'm ordering the carrier 2 and hope its big enough. It was confusing at first but then fairly easy to set up bein given only picture directions... but very nice."
2,Too small,"I purchased the carier after measuring my dog and the carrier was not as big as they say it is. My dog is only 11 pounds and it says the description say it fits dogs up to 20 pounds. It is a sturdy carrier though and it was very easy to put together. My dog could not sit properly or turn around. It was clearly misrepresented but I purchased the Cayman 2 and it was perfect. If you have a very small or short dog, this carrier works. I would reccomend that you do measure your dog and purchase the next size up. It is airine approved which is great but all in all I have to give it two stars because it was not the size or demensions the description provides."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Now, let's see if we've got this straight: the author, Kash, comes from a solid, two-parent, white middle-class American family that affords him the opportunity to seek a college education and he has the audacity to depict himself as having bootstrapped his way from ""humble"" beginnings to the top of the corporate heap?? Gimme a break. This is hardly a rags-to-riches, here's-how-you-can-do-it-too guidebook, despite outward appearances to the contrary. Moreover the alleged lessons he articulates (i.e. ""Be nice to people and they will be nice to you"") are little more than common sense mantras that any aspiring tycoon with a modicum of integrity can realize on his/her own, B-school or no B-school."
5,A must read!,"I found ""Make Your Own Luck"" to be a true reflection of its author. Mr. Kash has proven himself to be one of the great business minds of the twenty-first century. The intelligence, eloquence and foresight of the book make it a must read for any and all who wish to be successful in business and in life as a whole."
5,Junge Komm Bald Wieder,"This is a 3-CD set. The only complaint is that on my set, the labels on CD 1 and CD 2 are swapped, i.e., the label for CD 1 is actually printed on CD 2 and vice versa. Scanning and label-making corrected that.If the tracks don't match the contents list, that's why."
5,One of the Greatest,"Anthology is a copulation of the greatest hits from perhaps the greatest Sax player ever. Every song on this Album is a masterpiece, and well worth the money spent. There are so many timeless classics on This two CD set, like ""Georgia On My Mind"" and ""Ain't No Sunshine."" My only complaint would be the fact ""Winelight"" was not included, but I own the CD so not too much of a loss. If you love Jazz, especially if you love the sax, I highly recommend this album. I would also recommend with this album that you buy ""Anthology (Elektra)"" as well as ""Winelight"" you won't be disappointed."
5,Superb anthology: what if I can't purchase it ?,"The five star reviews herein accurately evaluate the reasons this double CD anthology is THE ONE to own . . . however, you probably steer clear of it for monetary considerations . . . so, should you deprive yourself of a representative overview of Washington's stellar music . . . one that may not capture all the best of his Motown and Kudu work but does offer a collection of seventy-nine minutes of his fabulous playing . . . opt instead for the collection entitled ""Grover Washington Jr., the essential collection"" compiled by Spectrum/Motown . . . it contains some of his best Motown work and . . . after listening for seventy-nine minutes, you'll be certain to replay it again! I'd rate the experience 5 stars regardless of the material found in the anthology but missing from the ""essential"" compilation. For your money it's hard to beat !!"
5,Great home theater system,"Bought this at Fry's Electronics. Easy to set up. Although stands are kind of too short for floor use. The built in DVD player is great and plays my AVI files right from computer. Most players do not. Also, the ipod dock is very convenient. Plus, it looks really cool.Highly recomended for the price."
4,Almost there,"The Good.-Very easy to clean. Use one of the inclued spatulas to scape off the major stuff, and toss the grilling plates in the dishwasher.-Grilling plates seem sturdy, like the non-stick surface won't rub right off (but avoid direct metal contact).-Nice looking.The Bad.-Even at the highest setting, 425, I can't sear meat.-Seems that when large amounts of food placed on grill, grill temp drops, and it takes too long to get back up, food steams as opposed to grills.Overall, I would recommend. The ability to be cleaned in the dishwasher outweighs its disadvantages.But if you are looking for something that can make a great steak, keep looking."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed with the grill. It was not what I expected inasmuch as the meat cooks alright, but the meat comes out a gray color. I expected it to cook out as a grill would. Browned with grill marks on it."
1,Not a true George Foreman grill,"I own an older version of the GF Grills. A superb machine by all standards!This one I purchased for the conveniences it offered:1. A timer, which is not really necessary2. A temperature control switch that does not work for the following reason: Once the 5 minute pre-heat cycle is reached automatically, it becomes impossible to defy physics and (presto!) lower it to the suggested 160 degrees to cook (for example) shrimp.3. The detachable plates rest on two rectangular elements that interfere with the even distribution of the heat, resulting in undercooked stuff near the edges of the cooking surface.We ditched it an will stick to our old and reliable regular grill.I will not recommend it to any one at all!"
1,Save your money,"I had a smaller, older model GF grill which I loved, but the finish was peeling off the plates, so when I heard about the removable plates that could go in the dishwasher I was excited. To my great disappointment the new and improved ""Next Grilleration"" merely steamed my food, there was no hint of a grilled texture. I tried burgers, chops, chicken breasts and sausages and was disappointed every time. Now I'm sorry I gave the old one away. Incidentally, after paying approximately $100.00 for this, I found it a week later at Wal-Mart for about $60.00. I feel twice burned."
1,poor results,"I purchased the GFP99 about one month ago and I have used it to prepare several different meals. Each time was a disappointment. I have an older family size GF that works well, but is difficult to clean. I bought the new one because of the removable plates. They are quite easy to remove and clean. The old GF is such a pain to clean, that I only used it for grilling sandwiches.The GFP99 is much slower to heat up than the older GF. I think it takes roughly 15 minutes to achieve it's highest temperature. Unfortunately, even at it's highest setting, it still is not as hot as the older GF. I tried cooking small(bone in) lamb chops -- after 20 minutes I removed them and cooked them in a pan. I cooked turkey burgers, scallops, and grilled sandwiches. It took much longer than pan frying, or the older GF, and the results were not very good (uneven cooking, no searing).I plan to return it to tomorrow."
1,Wish I read reviews before buying,"Didn't even get through cooking a steak, and it shut down, also when first started had an awful smell. Can't write much more as I didn't get to use it very long, I sure won't replace it with the same. Thanks for the reviews, wish I had read them before."
2,Bad outweighs the Good,"Sadly I've had a number of the same bad experiences as other reviewers. The grill emits a strong smell of burning plastic whenever I use it. When new, I assumed it was a manufacturer's coating burning off. However, after numerous cleanings and uses, it still gives off the smell (it looks as though steam from the food is melting the plastic top as it cooks). Also, the temperature is not hot enough for true grilling and the food looks and feels uninviting. It's truly a shame that the ease of cleaning was not properly combined with the extraordinary function of my older George Foreman."
1,Frustrating Foreman grill,"I had a great little Foreman grill which was a bit small but always cooked a great burger, so I thought I'd upgrade to this. Bad mistake. Number one, it is very slow to heat. Number 2, it never seems to heat up hot enough. Number 3, it is confusing (there is a little timer which is sometimes operating to countdown on the (eternal) prewarming process, and is sometimes your own cooking timer. Very confusing and stupid.How could you take such a nice simple product and f- it up? Well they did I'm afraid."
3,Doesn't get as hot as the smaller Foreman grills,"I also have one of the smaller grills,George Foreman GR10ABW Champ Grill with Bun Warmer, Whitebut was unhappy with not being able to remove the plates to wash and wanted something larger. Bought this one thinking it would make life easier. However, found out that even at highest temp, it doesn't seem to get as hot as the small one and takes twice as long to cook food. Also seems to take forever to heat up. What I liked about the smaller one was the ability to sear fish and meat and cook quickly. This one seems to steam the food rather than grill it. This one is also VERY heavy. I'm thinking I will keep it awhile and give it another chance, but then if still not worth the wait, will donate to Goodwill."
2,Fan of George Foreman Grills but this one is a must not buy.,"Bought this GRP99 on June 1,2010 and worked great 1st use. On 2nd use it took forever to heat up then started turning off and hard to get it to turn back on to finish cooking! Tried calling the toll free number in the book and after being on hold for so long they wanted for you to leave a voicemail and they will call you back in 24-48 hours. The book ask to not take it back to the store but that is exactly what I will probably do. I have had several George Foreman grills in the past and they all still work. Just bought this one because of the removal plates is a great convience. As for the cooking, when it cooks, is great. Just getting it this particlar one to work and finish cooking is another matter. The cooking is the only reason it got 2 stars from me. Maybe this is just a bad one I don't know but very dissappointed in this particular grill. About the time I get to think I will get to talk to someone it send me to voicemail."
4,"Easy to use, easy clean up, cooks great!","Some people had mentioned quality issues with this grill, so I was a little wary, but I have had no problem at all. The cooking plates are dishwasher safe, but can be a tight fit. It's easy enough to just wipe them off with a sponge anyway so I don't always bother. I used the heck out of it in just the first couple weeks and my only complaint is the power cord is too short. Unless you have plenty of counter space right next to the outlet, your going to need an extension cord."
5,George Foreman Grill,"George Foreman GRP99 Next Generation Grill with Removable Plates, Silver Metallic FinishThis is an exellent all purpose grill. I had the same model previously and it was perfect for everything I wanted to do (from hot dogs to steaks). Preparation time is quick, clean-up is simple, and it took me about four years to wear out the old one. It still works even though I dropped and cracked it in several places.I trust the new one will give me the same service. I use it almost every day. It is definitely a great buy."
1,POOR PERFORMANCE BY WHOLESALERS CLUB,i REMOVED MY FEEDBACK AS YOU ASKED. nOw you should perform. Let mary and mike(the recipents of the grill) hear from you so they can return the damaged grIll and you can replace it. DO IT NOW!.THANK YOUBOB MENKE
5,George Foreman Grill,"I bought this grill in England some time ago and loved it so much I bought one for my daughter in the USA. Grilled chicken, pork chops, pork sausages etc are so easy and quick to cook. The non-stick plates are so easy to remove and clean too."
5,Awesome as a gift,"I purchased this grill for a friend of mine and we used recently and she loved it. I told her that I loved using mine because the food stays juicy and cooks in rapid time. Plus, clean up is a breeze."
3,"Good, but could be better","The removable plates are a major positive, but I do wish the plates would get hotter. Some larger meats take a VERY long time to cook, but they do cook evenly."
2,"Doesn't compare to my ""Lean Mean Grilling Machine""","I loved my ""Lean Mean Grilling Machine"", but it was a royal pain to clean. So I decided to get the next Grilleration, primarily for the removable grilling plates. MISTAKE...Yes the Grilleration is easy to clean, but doesn't brown. I think there is something wrong with the temperature control. I set it up to 450 and still before the meat even starts to get even a little brown, it is in for 15 min. Well it seems that I made a mistake in buying it."
5,healthy grilling,"this is the 3rd one of this model that we have had, my hubby uses it almost daily to fix a quick lunch"
1,Broken,Item arrived cracked so cannot review. Item had to have been thrown very hard to crack since it was well insulated inside. Awaiting replacement.
3,Good way to cook on the counter,"The only complaint that I have with these units is eventually the coating starts come off. I would say every two years we have had to buy a new one. Also, it is easy to scratch if you don't use only the Foreman sponges. It does cook the food great and takes up little counter space the long term usage is poor."
3,"Large, affordable counter top grill","The Good: Affordable. Very large compared to most counter top grills. Very easy to clean. Latches on removable grilling plates have been made more secure than the previous ones. This is comforting since on my previous Geo. Foreman grill this size the plates would occasionally fall off which was dangerous.Very easy to clean the removable surfaces and the non-stick coating is durable.The Bad. The AC cord is very short, like maybe 3 feet. If you are looking for a grill to sear meat, this probably isn't the grill to buy. Although it gets plenty hot, it never seems to reach temperatures high enough to sear."
5,wonderful product,"I have used and loved this grill for 4 years now and bought this one for my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas. My daughter-in-law did not feel she would like the grill but the week after Christmas she told me she had used it every night that week. The key is the removeable, easy to clean plates. I never would use this grill if the plates did not come off for cleaning. This is the only other electric appliance I use for cooking except for my range. We liked our first one so much, when it burnt out we bought an idenical one and now have an extra set of plates. Wonderful!"
5,George Foreman GRP99,This product is just what I expected. Great service from Amazon. I bought this for my son because of the removable grates.
1,do not buy,"Purchased first grill in June 2012 used it three times and then it died, contacted Russel Hobbs who supplied it and they replaced it with another grill. Used it three times and it died. Now returning second grill to Amazon for a refund."
2,Not what I expected,"I have owned several George products and have never been disappointed, but this one in an exception. It takes way too long to heat up. When I put the food on the grill, it takes far to long to cook it. It has that new electrical product burning smell still after several uses. I like that the grill plates come out, but poor heating is the price to pay for easier cleaning, I will take the old style hands down. It is just not what I expected from a George product."
4,"Great grill, easy to clean","This is a huge improvement over our old Foreman grill. As far as cooking goes, it's the same trusted workhorse - all meats and veggies I've cooked on it come out great and without the grease. The removable plates are very easy to clean, which was my only complaint about my original Foreman. After over a year of use, some of the nonstick coating is gone around the ridges, but I haven't noticed any other wear issues. Great grill!"
2,It was good while it lasted.,"The plates' holders wear out, and the plates actually start to FALL off this grill, making it dangerous. At least one other review noted this. My grill just fried, just plain stopped working after about 1 year. I guess for $80 one year ain't bad but it's disappointing and I am looking into Hamilton Beach instead. It cooked well, except for the hazards and it dying."
5,FINALLY!,"This is what the George Foreman grill should have been in the first place. First, it looks more like a fax machine or a printer than a grill. And the fact that its silver and black matches my computer color scheme makes it look even more like a piece of office equipment. But that aside, it has a timer!!! It's a bit annoying that the timer sets itself to five minutes when the unit is first turned on. But I appreciate not having to use my kitchen timer anymore. The removeable plates are a plus. I've talked to dozens of women who have abandoned their GF grill because they couldn't get it white-glove clean in between uses. They just don't understand, as we men do, that it's a GRILL! A bit of last week's sirloin just adds character to today's burgers. Next time you're grilling outside, wipe a white glove over your barbeque. I'm sure this new feature will bring a lot of women back. I fully recommend it. Oops, my steak is done!"
4,Great Product.,This George Forman Grill is so easy to cook and clean. I have had other earlier versions and they weren't as easy to clean. This timer and temperature gauge is great. It is worth the its weight in price alone in all the fat you don't cook in.
1,Bad Grill,I read mixed reviews on this item. Some loved it and others loathed it. My experience is like some of the bad ones. The case on mine heated to the point of warping and then the whole unit just died and wouldn't turn on again. I think the idea for it's design is great but it falls short of being a well made piece of equipment. Thank you amazon.com for taking care of me when it came to returning it. I feel safe shopping with you. I think I'll get the GRP4 model instead. Not really any bad reviews on that one.
3,Next Generation Grill Does not get searing hot.....,"I have had the Geo. Foreman Grill with all the attachment plates for 2 years and LOVED IT. Used it daily but it finally just needed to be replaced. Well I only use the grill so thought that the Next Generation still with removable plates (a MUST HAVE) would be an excellent replacement. I also liked the idea of the digital controls. Well it just does not get hot enough, no matter how long you preheat it, to sear the meet on the outside. It hardly changes the color before it is done. We like our steaks med/rare and the old grill did a super job of that. Even hamburgers were perfect. It says it goes to 450 degrees but I am not happy with this feature..... Too bad cause we already gave the old one away."
2,Down and Out,"As others have noted, the first two grills arrived damaged with the lids completely smashed. The third was packaged properly so it arrived intact. Nevertheless there was a problem. After two or three uses I found that the top grill plate just falls off when you open the lid (it's hot so don't let the kids near this appliance). No matter how much time I take to secure it when the lid is lifted the plate will fall off. Also, as others have noted grease builds up in the hinge area joining the base and the top. I should have taken the refund when Amazon offered it on the 2nd return."
1,Broke after 2 years - NOT FIXABLE!,"Was OKAY for about 18 months, then it stopped working. Contacted customer service and they tell me the parts are not consumer purchasable. Contacted them again regarding service and they said there are NO SERVICE CENTERS. Warranty was only 1 year, so I'm out of luck. BAD PRODUCT!"
2,nice idea but....,"I bought this as a gift and when the recipient opened the box to use it, it was smashed. Too Bad!!"
1,Would love to try it,"When I opened the box that my new George Foreman grill was shipped in, the lid of the grill was cracked and a big piece was completely broken off. I went through Amazon's online return process and a new one was sent to me via 2-day shipping. I opened this second box, and much to my dismay this grill also had a large plastic piece of the casing broken off. It's obvious that the manufacturer is not packing the grills to be individually shipped. It's very frustrating and I'm reluctant to try another replacement shipment. However, I'm hoping the third time's a charm and I'll actually get to use the grill that I've heard so many good things about. My advice, unless you're willing to go through several trips to the post office to return damaged grills, you should buy this from a local retail store and avoid the shipping hassles."
1,defective,"I have used the George foreman grills in the past, and have been very pleased, but hate the clean up. I recently bought this one with the removable plates, but had to return it the next day. When I was preheateing it the first time, it started to smoke and gave off an awefull burned plastic smell. I won't want my kids to eat of that!!!"
4,Great For Winter Time,"Good alternative to those really cold winter days .When you want something grilled fast.I wish it had more attachments,plus its bulky."
5,You can't go wrong!,"Our first George Foreman grill didn't have removable plates. This one does and it is so much easier to care for! I love how you can set the temperature and the timer, both features that the older models didn't have. We can't imagine not having a George Foreman grill. It's the only way to cook healthy food quickly!"
5,Great Improvements to a great Idea!,This is a must have for every homne. Great for grilling indoors for bad weather and eliminates stove top and broiler cooking too. We use it all the time and it a breeze to clean-up now.
1,Not hot enough,This unit is not worth the extra money. With the removable plates it lost the heat transfer to the meat and just does not get hot enough. I used a simple Foreman grill before [not removable plates] but this one does just not measure up
1,Why no room for 0 stars?,Got grill 8/1/2005. Grilled 4 porkchops 8/1/2005. Chops scored first round knockout on New Generation Grill. Short out in 4 minutes 22 seconds.I had to buy it and see it to believe it! Don't say you weren't warned.
1,Do Not Buy,"I had one of the original grills that looked like a ""TOILET SEAT"". Although it was ugly, it did work and did grill the food. The drawback was cleaning it. When this new grill came out I immediately bought it. The cleanup was great but, & I say BUT it doesn't work. It does not grill, it sort of steams the food and it has a horrible taste. It also does not heat evenly. Do yourself a favor, buy the old model that does not have the removeable grills. This new model is HORRIBLE & I am out $100-."
1,George aint that good,I ordered this grill in Dec. 2011 as a Christmas gift for my wife. From the first use it has had an electronic burnt smell when it was on. We have used this grill countless times since Christmas and always with the foul smell. Also it takes forever to heat up. Tonight we tried pork chops at 425 degrees. After 20 min. it said it had reached the 425 degrees. We cooked the chops for 10 min. but they never browned. After that I checked the temp. with an infrared thermometer. The top plate was only at 380-390 degrees and the bottom plate was around 400 degrees. Far below the 425 degrees it was set for.The bottom line is this is not a very good grill and I would not recommend this grill to anyone. Its only been in use for 5 months and its past the return date for Amazon. This isn't the first time for the time for a return to have run out. I am having second thoughts about buying from Amazon
4,George Foreman Grill GRP99,"I had a smaller George Foreman and wanted a bigger one. This is perfect for me and my family. It does remove fat while the meat is cooking and cooks it quick and tasty. The other plus factor is the removable grill plates. I just throw them in the dishwasher and they come out great. Be careful, some grills don't have this feature and I bet would be difficult to clean."
5,Best Family-size grill so far,We have used 2 of the George Foreman grills before. The original small Foreman grill and the large family-size grill. Both are great but cleaning the grill plates is a tough task. The size of this grill and the removable plates make this grill 100% better than our older grills. Plus the temperature control is fantastic.
4,It's in use every day,This is the second George Foreman GRP99 that I purchased. It is a very good unit and I use it almost every day. Only problem is securing the top plate. The first unit I purchased failed when I was removing the steak I was cooking and the top plate fell to the floor and ruined one of the clips. I have had the same problem with the recently purchased unit except I am now extremely careful when using it.
3,By George,This grill is great for cooking all kinds of meats. Ive even made grilled sandwiches on it. It is a little cumbersome to store and it's too large to leave on my countertop. The only other thing I have against it is that the grease runs down the back of the unit when the top is raised to remove the cooked food and it's very difficult to clean the spaces the grease gets in. But all in all I think it's a pretty good buy.
5,A lot easier to use,"I have the old George Foreman grill. What a pain to clean! This one is really nice. Not as large as the old family sized one, but big enough for two strip steaks."
1,Let the Buyer Beware!,"I had another George Foreman grill that I used every day for years. Eventually it died. I loved it! So when it came to buying another, I came to Amazon and started to look at the newer models. I purchased this version, attracted by the timer and heat setting, features not available on the gril I previously owned. And the removeable grills for cleaning! Wow! That must be great! Well, no! Since day one the grills barely attached to the body. Took so much effort to get them to adhere, I took to cleaning it the old fashioned way. Half way through grilling, the top grill would come flying off. Since it was heated up to 425 degrees, there have been quite a few burns, and a couple of close calls with it landing nearly on top of my bare feet. Great concept, very poorly executed. Very disappointed. Does a great job grilling, however."
3,"Great Grill, but plastic cover broke on first use!","I purchased my first George Foreman grill 3 years ago, and have probably set some kind of use record. I use it at least 3 times a week and have been impressed with how well it has held up. I decided to upgrade to GRP99 because of its removable plates and larger grilling surface than my previous model. I used it for the first time last night and other than the plates being a bit ""wobbly"" as mentioned in another review, I was very satisfied. When I went to remove the grilling plates for cleaning I noticed a one inch long crack in the plastic cover which holds the top grilling plate in place. When I gently put pressure on the crack to see how bad it was, a nice size chunk of the cover came off. What scares me is that this was only after one use."
2,Really disappointed,"This is my 3rd George Foreman grill and I have to say I am disappointed in this one. I have to turn it up to the highest setting just to cook hamburgers and it takes 20 minutes to cook unlike the old models that only took 10 minutes. It doesn't seem to get hot enough. It also takes more than the 5 minutes to heat up. It is taking at least 10 minutes to heat up as the blinking light is showing. I am seriously considering sending it back, not for a refund though as I really love my grills. Maybe this one is defective so I am willing to try another. In it's defense though I will say I like the removable plates. The old type was hard to clean. Now if they only could come up with a plate attached for drippings."
2,A slight disappointment,"This grill is better in theory than practice. I'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really isn't practical for steaks except very thin ones. It's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches. I haven't tried some of the other recipes so I can't really comment on anything else. It is easy to clean, so that's a plus."
3,Removable Foreman Grill,It's great if you want your meat to come out steamed. The first unit I got had a problem with the heater. It was exchanged with another unit. The new unit worked better but was still not grilling the meat the way I wanted it to so I went and purchased another George Foreman grill that had non removable plates. This one grills the meat perfectly for me. Clean up is a problem but I guess I'll have to live with that.
1,works until it melts and the cooking plates fall off,"Got this thing about a year ago, and the removable plates, timer, and adjustable temp are big improvements over earlier versions. But after a few uses, the plastic cover on ours melted a bit and is now a bit deformed and ugly. AND the top cooking plate tends to disconnect when opening the thing. Today it fell off clanged onto the floor just missing my foot, spattering grease all over the place.Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart make similar products, and they are probably better engineered. Even though this one is no long under warranty, it's getting boxed up and shipped back to the manufacturer."
5,Much easier to clean,"This cooker is much easier to use, the temperature and timer controls are great. Being able to easily remove the cooking surfaces and pop them into the dishwasher is much better that our other Foreman cooker."
5,He's Done It Again!,"We ""traded up"" to this larger GF grill. This grill fits 6 burgers, 4 LARGE chicken breasts, steaks and pork chops with no problem at all. {I really had to squish meat to fit on my smaller GF grill!} The only thing I noticed about this larger grill, is that it doesn't automatically heat up as hot the grill I had. It's default temperature is 300 degrees. The temperature can be adjusted, which is a great feature. I tried cooking 4 large chicken breasts using the recommended cook time for 300 degrees {10 minutes}. They weren't done all the way the through. I added an additional 5 minutes and they came out great! I'm going to be adding 3-5 minutes of cook time to the recommended time on the chart or increasing the temperature to 350 degrees. Overall, I would recommend this grill to anyone. It's quick, easy to use and the cooking trays can go in the dishwasher! What more do you need?!"
1,it sucks,"had 3 previous george forman grills and used them just about every day. bought this piece of crap in dec and now is dead. will return it and buy another brand. this is the second one of this type that will be returned. first one didn't even work but thought giving it a second chance would be ok. wrong!!! if this is the type of products that george forman is putting his name on then he better get into another line of work, maybe brakes."
1,Manufacturer defects,"I previously owned the family size George Forman and decided to change to the newer model, it was shaped better which made for better storage, and the griddles were removable which made it easier to clean. I purchased this model and started to cook and the unit shut down no power the unit just burnt out hadn't even finished cooking hamburgers called the manufacturer and they advised me to return it to the store since the 30 days hasn't expired exchanged it for another and power problem was fine but during the cooking the top of the unit bubbled up and now has 2 big bumps on the top and I have since returned that one."
2,Returned to store,"We were'nt completely satisfied almost from the day of purchase. Bought it primarily because of the removable grill plates. We were happy w/ our first GF grill, but the plates were not removable. First concern was excessive preheat time required. We never did cook on any setting other than the highest heat setting. When the teflon coating began to come off the grill plates within 60 days of purchase, we were only too happy to return it for a refund (not a replacement)."
5,dishwasher safe,Seems to work great so far. nice that grills are dishwasher safe used at college by novice and he loves it.
4,New George Foreman Grill,"Having this new grill makes eating healthy, pleasing and fun. Using the cookbook that came along with it, it is amazing how many different kinds of food you can cook on it from meats, poultry, fish, vegetables AND fruit and the different ways you can cook them. The timer is nice too because it keeps you from overcooking your food. Cleaning it is a breeze so that you don't think twice about using it. I just love it."
2,George Forman grill is overated,"The George Forman grill is highly overated for the price. the removable plates never really get hot enough to grill and sear the meat, it more likes steams the meat, you do not get that real grill flavor. Very poor design with the removable plate,its a chore to attach them. not a good deal for the price."
1,Trading Performance for Easy Cleaning,"If you own a first generation Foreman grill, you know the one aspect of using it you'd like to see improved. Cleaning it is a chore. This grill is a snap to clean, pop out the plates & into the dishwasher. Unfortunately this major improvement comes with a severe price. The performance of this grill is simply awful. The heating elements are, out of necessity, located behind the grill plates, relying on conduction to heat the actual cooking surfaces. Bad idea, or at least bad execution. The plates NEVER get hot enough to sear anything, even when preheated forever at the highest temperature setting (425 degrees, don't you believe it!). No browning, no sizzle, no flavor. Forget doing steaks in this, unless you like them ruined. 1 star only for ease of cleaning, otherwise, no stars. Why would anyone want a grill that doesn't grill, no matter how easy it is to clean?"
5,George Foreman Next Generation Grill is AWESOME,"Just grilled 4 large Round Steaks, 2 at a time, with the George Foreman Next Generation Grill, and they all came out perfectly grilled and very delicious. The best part is how easy it was to clean. I have a small sink, but even on a small sink, the removable plates fit easily in the sink, making cleanup a snap. I highly recommend the Next Generation Grill."
1,Burnt out in 4 months,"Typical US marketing, tie a celebrity to a product, manufacture a POS off shore, mark it up and stick the American consumer with a cheap product that does not last."
3,Questionable that it was new,Received the grill but it was scratched on the top cover which indicated to me that it was not new but possibly used and returned. The grill works fine and I guess that is what really matters.
4,G.F. Grill,Product as advertized. Very pleased with removable Grill plates. Dealer was fast and I would shop with them again.
4,George Forman GRP99,"The product is as described with the ability to remove the grille plates and wash them. You can cook more food at one time than the regular grilles. However, the heating surface is in a limited space and takes longer to cook the outer sides of a steak for example. Nothing bad, just have to be aware that the extra cooking surface doesn't get as hot as the middle. Frequent repositioning is required."
1,A vast improvement,"Like many others I had the original Foreman grill that cooked great but was a pain to clean, so I was delighted to see it reinvented with removable plates. I read through the reviews here and was sufficiently impressed enough to get one, and so far I've been very happy with it. The complaints about loose plates? Well, here's an idea--before you turn it on attach the plates, then give each one a tug to make sure it's latched properly. Takes ... I don't know, a whole five seconds? I've done steaks, burgers, chicken breasts, sandwiches and bacon in this and all have turned out well, and clean-up is a breeze. If you're expecting a recreation of your outdoor grill it may be a disappointment, but I've always gotten nice grill marks and have no quibble with the taste of the food. If you're a fan of the original GF grill you'll like this one even more.I gave this four stars, but Amazon's only showing one, sorry!"
5,Watch the fat drip away,"We've owned two Foreman grills before this one, and our only regret is not getting the one with various plates. I love that you can remove the plates for washing, it makes using the grill so much more enjoyable. The cookbook and cleaning sponge that are included are wonderful accessories."
3,George Foreman grill,"It is easy to operate and creates no mess, easy to clean; however, so far I am not too crazy about it, we tried grilling several times, if you grill it less time, meat has more of a ""cooked"" rather than grilled taste, if you leave it on a grill longer it becomes too dry."
3,A few issues,"Having been a George Foreman Grill fan for a number of years, I eagerly awaited the demise of my last GF so I could buy this one. I loved the grill but have always hated the hassle of cleaning it. Removable grill plates seemed the answer to my dreams.After getting the new grill I find that it needs to be preheated, a process that takes up to 10 minutes to get to 425 on the digital temp readout. Even then, when I put the meat on the grill, I do not hear that satisfying sizzle I used to hear with my old one piece GF grill. It does not seem to sear the meat as well as the old style. I guess the swap convenience for efficiency in this case and I am still not sure which I prefer."
2,Quality slipping?,"This purchase was to replace an older version of this same model. The newer version didn't produce the same temps, and the plates imparted a metallic / foreign taste that continued even after the unit was used over a year and a half. I suspect the non-stick coating was the culprit. We went back to using the old unit.This will probably be the last time we buy a George Foreman grill."
2,Broke on second day,"I bought this to replace the same model that had a heating element fail after about 4 years. The replacement had a handle crumble off one of the plates on the second day. I would be in bad shape if I hadn't saved my old plates. Two weeks later, I don't have a replacement part. If yours breaks, send it back. Calling the 800 number for warranty is not worth your time. FYI Black and Decker is the factory name."
5,Great Product,We spent a lot of time searching for an indoor grill and came across this amazing product. Not only is it an excellent grill but it comes with several different plates. I have loved using the pan for lasagna and brownies. The grill itself is excellent for making a quick and tasty chicken dinner. I have had this product for 4 months and every time I use it I am grateful all over again that we purchased it.
3,it is basically OK,"I returned my first George Foreman grill as the plates were hard to clean, so I wanted one with the plates (heating units) detachable. I purchased this one after reading the reviews and checking the grill in Target. I ordered it, used it and basically it is trouble to use.. cleaning it that is. And I do not get the grill effect that supposedly it can give somewhat. So it is taking up space o my kitchen counter. If you wish to use it and clean it and do veggies basically,, it is OK"
1,Died on the first use....,"I think we would have loved this product - we bought it because of it's easy clean up with it's removable grills - only problem is it died on it's first use. The power went off, and the exterior of the top lid bulged up - and that was all she wrote! Now I have to return the item. Not sure if this was just because it was a defective unit - but it seems a little unsafe if the item starts to warp when you use it!"
2,George Foreman Grill,We were not very well pleased with the grill. Cooking times recommended were not accurate. Preheat time takes longer than suggested. I rank my charcoal grill over it by ten to one as far as flavor and tenderness.
4,Great Grill!,I have had other brands of grills that I just thought I loved. This one has been the best ever! We use it constantly and I love the easy clean up.
1,They could be good with some fixing.,The wife and I have had ours for about two years and she is very careful how she uses it and does not remove the upper plate as she has had trouble getting it to reclamp. We decided to order one of this model for a Christmas present for our Grand daughter but was very disappointed in receiving it with a broken upper plate clamp. The plastic that holds the screws together isn't very strong and the one that we gave our grand daughter sure wasn't packed like it should have been. So now we are stuck with a product we can't sure as the grand daugher gave it back to us. The wife plans to call the manufacture today and see about a replacement handle. All other George Foreman products that we have seen or own have been good but this one needs the manufacturer's attention.
1,Zolar's Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Dreams,"This book was copy written in 1963. It is so out dated it has the audacity to describe what it means to see a Colored man or woman in your dream. A Colored person is an old term, once used in describing African Americans. The same racism is used for Jewish people, and Chinese people in this book. Though it goes into details what it means to see Colored people, Jewish people, Chinese people etc., in dreams. No where in the book does it mention what it means to dream of seeing Caucasian people. Which lead you to believe the Authors must have assumed, all their readers were only Caucasian people. This book is a reproduction from the old original 1963 edition, before Civil Rights. It is so out dated it should be pulled from the shelves immediately. I purchased it for .50 cents on a mark down sales table in a book store. But it's not worth a dime. Thank you! Andree' Smith"
5,Excellent contents on,"This book has excellent contents on entrepreneur corporate spin-off.It covers corporate spin-offs' facts, factors, inpacts, policies, references, and so on."
4,Pig Ear Strips,"This box of 10 oz, came from Chile. There is a company in Southern California that processes Pig Ear Strips for Pet Stores. Why are we importing from Chile? It just increases the cost."
2,Disappointing,These were disappointing to me as they had a very greasy feel and a strong smell or petroleum like gas or kerosene. I had to cook them in water a little to get my dog to eat them.
4,"Not as great as other Smokie albums, but","still good. Contains some great songs like ""If you think..."", title song, ""Don't play your rock'n'roll"" and ""Back to Bradford"". Some songs are weak. Overall - 4 stars."
4,the art of the decoys,"here is a real history in the art of decoy carvings.one can pick it up and see just how far we have advance in the art of carving decoys.one has the ability to see the different stiles, and ways the artist has come to copy feathered friends.being a carver myself, it was very enjoyable reading.very informative."
3,1 of 2 was Quick to fail and leak air,"Great die grinder for the $$$ but of the two we ordered one of then blew an O-ring and became useless after less than 60 days in service, and there is no way to order a part from the company or get a size etc.....so they expect u to throw it out or go on a wild goose chase to find the right size and thickness Oring. I sugest you spent $100 and get a nicer model."
3,poor dvd quality,"The information contained in this is quite useful if you wish to learn imrovisation yechniques. True it doesn't teach you chords, keys or scales but no one getting this wants to learn all that anyway. ( Plus learning chords is easy anyway.) The problem I have is with the dvd itself. The quality is somewhat poor and it seems that they just copied directly from the vcr tape, which I already had. There are no chapters or scene selections so you have to fast forward and reverse to what you want to see just like a vcr tape. Granted you can ""mark"" the spots but only if you plan on leaving the dvd in the player. That is my only complaint since I had hoped I could just select a section and go directly to it to review. As this can't be done the dvd is no better than a vcr tape."
3,Must see for anyone that wants to try and play the piano,This video provides the new piano player with a method of learning to play without learning to read music. Of course the method has its limitations but can certainly provide the piano player with little to no experience the chance to play full sounding music in a very short time period. Of course a serious piano player would scoff at this method but for those who want to learn to play and enjoy playing I would say its a must buy.
1,Poorly conceived.,"This video is worthless for purposes of teaching you how to play the piano. It does not teach you how to read music. It does not teach you the 7 notes of the keyboard. It does not show you how to play any tunes. What does it do? It shows you how to play notes sequentially up and down the keyboard (as if you need a video to show you how to do that), and refers to the keys by numbers; whereas the rest of the world refers to the keys of a piano by the letters A to G. Very poorly conceived approach."
4,I learned in 1/2 hour!,"I received a keyboard for Christmas and this tape...I learned to play something that ""sounded"" like a real song in only 1/2 hour. I called my fiancee on his cell phone and made him listen to my ""improv"" sesh!"
5,Let's Make Music,"I am very happy with this CD. I purchased the Video, several years ago, and started to work with it. I was thrilled with Patty's technique and how easy it was for me to catch on to it. Soon, I was creating my own music. I have always loved the piano and after taking conventional lessons and getting nowhere (because I just couldn't learn how to read music), I found that I can create and play my own music, by using Patty's techniques. I really like the CD, since I can pop it into my laptop computer and use it with my Electronic Keyboard, anywhere I like. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to play the piano/keyboard. Patty shows you how to create your own music, and you do not even need to learn how to read music. Her technique is all improvisation, and she makes it so easy! It is, also, great for children who want to experiment on the piano/keyboard; they will be delighted that they can make their own music. Who knows, a new Star may emerge!"
1,Yuck!,"The positive reviews given for this product must have been written by employees of the company who produced the product. Thankfully, I checked out this item from the library at no cost. This video is worthless for purposes of teaching you how to play the piano. It does not teach you how to read music. It does not teach you the 7 notes of the keyboard. It does not show you how to play any tunes. What does it do? It shows you how to play notes sequentially up and down the keyboard (as if you need a video to show you how to do that), and refers to the keys by numbers; whereas the rest of the world refers to the keys of a piano by the letters A to G. Very poorly conceived approach."
2,small can,Beware this is the smallest can of tire foam I have ever seen. For the price it should be a reg size can.
2,Use your ears Mr. Gold !!!!,"Andrew Gold did some fine work in the past, but this c.d. is not what it could have been. The songs are produced in a 90's way with too much 90's instruments (fake strings). The songs are not very well written. You feel what they wanted to do, but it's not finished yet. The song ""King of showbiz"" is a ""Wax"" leftover. Mr Gouldman should be capable to write a great 60's song (He did so in the 60's). My advise if you like 60's sound-alikes that know what they are doing, buy the Rutles or the Dukes of the stratosphear."
4,Good quality product,"After a couple of days, scanner is working very good. It is very quiet but found it a ""bit"" slow for the price."
1,Do Not Buy This Scanner,"I have purchased two of these for my office. They have both been nothing but problems for me and my co-workers. This scanner pulls numerous pages through at once, which means I have to go back and re-scan. It jams very easily again, b/c of pulling to many pages through. This scanner is just not worth the money."
1,Don't buy - it's a loser,"This unit is way too unreliable for the amount of money it costs. Look elsewhere. On the other hand, I love my Canon 3080, which is more expensive, but is ""bulletproof"" and is much better in every aspect."
3,"Hardware good, software bad.","I have owned my 2050C for about 3 weeks. Whilst it has integrated quite well into my offices, it did take a 5 hours of frustration, an email to tech support, a 2 day wait for a reply, and a download of the latest CapturePerfect (3.0.30 iirc) to get multipage documents batching to pdf's without a consistent lockup on or about the 3rd document.I would have expected this very straightforward feature, which is heavily promoted in the product advertising, would be working out of the box (i.e. off the provided CD) for $500.Happy to have it functional now, but I suggest you email tech support for the latest CapturePerfect and bin the included CD."
4,Great scanner for small office,"Got this scanner for a small office looking to go paperless. It is not only fast, but the resolution is great. It scans in just about any kind of document. It takes up very little space. Great price and quick delivery from Amazon. May be interested in getting a second at a later time."
5,Reliable ADF,"I bought this scanner to replace my horrible Fujitsu ScanSnap FI-4110EOX2. After a week of ownership and 4700 pages scanned, I am delighted at how reliably the auto document feeder works. Most of my papers are damaged in some way (staple holes, creases, wrinkles, punched holes, or some combination of the mentioned). The DR-2050C handled most of them just fine, and far, far more reliably than my FI-4110EOX2. I would say I've had half a dozen jams so far. I am very pleased."
1,Worst scanner I've used to date,"If you're looking for an awesome scanner that actually feeds the pages you put into it through the feeder without pulling through multiple pages at random or if you're looking for a scanner that doesn't just randomly stop in the middle of a scan, then you probably don't want this one.It's easy to use, but it rarely works right - so I guess that just depends on what you actually need it to do (be easy? or work?). And do you have a lot of stuff to do with it? Then just forget it, it'll start jamming and causing problems a few hours into your project."
1,Save your money!,"I purchased this item mostly because it was inexpensive and seemed like it would serve my purpose of compressing a sleeping bag. The sleeping bag fit into the snugpak well, but as soon as I pulled the compression strap the buckle shattered. This bag is a complete POS. Spend the extra cash for a better system, this is just a waste."
3,Great Lionel layouts,The DVD was good in that it showed that there are some extreme layouts out there. I was a little disappointed in that it didn't show how they were built/ constructed.
5,Every little thing he does is magic!,"This version of ""Fragile"" just may be the very best. Singing it on September 11, 2001 after the terrorist attack on America, Sting dedicated it to those who lost their lives. He puts unbelievable passion into the song and can almost bring tears to your eyes with the emotion in it."
4,I Can See It When I Listen...,"I can almost see the musical being acted out on stage every time I listen to this soundtrack/concept recording. Linda Eder is at her fabulous best (as usual). On occasion, the music gets bogged down in the lyrics, but outside of that it's enjoyable. It's a must-have for any Linda Eder fan to complete their collection, and the rest of the tracks are worth the purchase price as well."
5,Good Goth,"Well I've watched david hasselhoffs production of this musical and although he is a brilliant stage actor. He's not a touch on Anthony warlow. Just listening to Anthony sing his part in the c.d He really makes the part his own, and what he does with hyde is just amazing,truly a great achievement. Well worth the listening."
5,YOU HAVE TO OWN IT!!!!,"Many people havn't heard of Jekyll and Hyde, and that's a shame. Anyone who loves musicals should definently give it a listen.Jekyll and Hyde is a story everyone knows, the classic fight between good and evil. New characters to the musical are Emma, Jekyll's loving fiancee, and Lucy, a prostitute who loves Jekyll, but ends up getting tangled up with Hyde.While you definently feel for good-hearted Jekyll (played to perfection by Anthony Warlow), you will feel even more for Lucy, played by the heavenly-voiced Linda Eder. Anyone who has ever felt unrequited love will be touched by "" Someone Like You"", and anyone who's been through hard times and a lot of sorrow will feel as though ""A New Life"" was written just for them.Worth the money alone is ""Confrontation"", in which Jekyll sings an electrifying duet with his counterpart, Hyde (so he's basically singing a duet with himself.)Give Jekyll and Hyde a try- I promise you won't regret it!"
5,Fabulous! It'll send delicious chills down your spine!,"This is one of the most fabulous masterpieces of American theatre that I have ever experienced! The vocals are breathtaking, the whole orchestration is fabulous! The sound of these voices, these lyrics, the sound - it all creates such a profound picture, even if you've never seen the show. You won't regret this purchase -EVER!"
5,The best J & H records available!!!:D,"I own this 2 CD set and it's my favorite broadway muscial. I went to the show @ Palm Spring in Jan. 1996 and I am going to see it again August in SF.Compared with the original casting recording, I think this is the BEST J&H music available!!A Strong Buy!!!"
5,Classic J&H album,While it is likely that Anthony Warlow will ever play the role of Jekyll again this is certainly a must for every fan!
3,Disappointing...,"I guess I bought this CD with my expectations pumped up by friends who'd mentioned the beauty of the music of Jeckyll & Hyde. What they neglected to mention, though, is that the songs are kinda slow, monotonous, and repetitive. Despite the acknowledged beauty of the melodies, they just keep going and going with little variation. Funny, when I confronted the aforementioned friends about this, they admitted that they also found the songs slow and rather predictable, but that they liked the pretty tunes enough to forgive the rest. I have to admit that Anthony Warlow and the rest of the cast gave tremendous performances. Their wonderful voices... and Warlow switching between Jeckyll and Hyde... were well worth hearing, if only in small doses. I'm not sure if I regret buying this CD, but I know I'm not running around forcing everyone to listen to it and I'm not playing it again and again until my roommate's ready to kill me, so... It's a decent CD, just not... perfect."
2,"sung to the tune of ""This is the Music"" (refrain)","This is the muzac,this stuff is trash,with synthesizersgushing like geisersin the back.Bland melodies,lyrics so trite,this is the muzac of the night."
5,Amazing!,"Anthony Warlow, in my opinion, is one of the best Jekyll and Hydes out there! He does a wonderful job singing ""I Need to Know"" and ""This is the Moment"". It is just a shame he never played the role on stage.Linda Eder does a great job on this recording. She does a smashing job on ""Someone Like You"". She is the best.This is Frank Wildhorn's best musical. If you don't already own this recording, get it...now!"
4,"Best Reference, yet","Since I have used this book as a guide in understanding dreams that I consider significant, my understanding of what God is telling me has at least doubled. I have tried using a few other guides, but they didn't seem to reveal what felt like truth or relevance to my life. I have suggested this book to christian family and friends."
5,Ira is a good man...,"This is an awesome book with keen insight into dreams and dream language. I have met the author a couple of times and he is ""the real deal.""To the reviewer who implied that Ira Milligan is prejudiced against African-Americans, I must tell you that you have missed the boat. I attended a conference organized by Ira and his main speaker and close friend is a wonderful African-American preacher. Ira is not prejudiced, and is probably so far FROM prejudiced that he isn't even aware how that section of the book might sound to someone *looking* to find prejudice."
3,Dreamer,I was looking for a book to help me understand spiritual meaning of dreams. This book gave good insight and it was backed up by scriptures. There were many dream symbols although it could have been a little more detailed. Overall I enjoyed the book and it will answer a lot of reader's questions regarding dreams.
2,Limited scope,"I hardly dream at night. But on 3 occasions I had dreams, of which 2 of them were a warning of what was happening at that time. I was searching for an answer to my recent third dream and a friend passed this book to me.This book covers on the possible interpretations of colors, animals, places and numbers in dreams, without giving any contextual or environmental contents or conditions. After reading through this book, I felt each of us has to interpret the symbols in our dreams in the right context. And the interpretation of symbols given by this book may or may not be valid to your dream. So be forewarned to merely use this for references. Eventually, you have to pray and let the Holy Spirit guide you in your interpretation of your dreams.The giver of the dreams holds the key to the messages behind the dreams you dream."
5,Understanding The Dreams You Dream,"This book helped me to be open to any dream that God gives me, whether it means a little or a lot. It has opened my eyes to the language of symbolism that God has always used in dreams. I have gotten so much freedom in my own life from being able to get the revelation and meaning of my dreams. This is a good tool for interpretation for any christian to have."
4,Understanding the Dreams you Dream,"I highly recommed the book! I have referenced it many times and now better understand my recent past, present and future. The only limitation is that not every symbol I dream about is included in the material."
2,Offers Very Limited information,"Was looking for a book that would be an easy and somewhat comprehensive reference to biblical dream symbolism. Upon looking thru the book I found that (in my opinion) the information offered in this book has a very narrow and limited perspective as to the biblical symbolism in dreams. Had I not taken a dream interpretation class taught by John Paul Jackson, a respected dream interpreter of the day, I would have accepted this book as having a more comprehensive viewpoint, but it does not. Bottom line is that the information provided is very much ""in the box""."
1,Disapointed,"I purchased this book because I had the same recurring dream. The book was disappointing. It only focused on some animals, the citations from the bible were hard to understand the language was not simplified enough. I ended up looking for the meaning of my whale dream on line."
5,Great complement to 6th grade S.S. curriculum in Calif.,"This book is very useful as a transition to the subject of social studies in a self-contained classroom. Some of the openers are questions (both open-ended and multiple choice), and some of them are anecdotes or stories. All are designed to pique student interest in what is sometimes perceived as a dry subject.The openers cover the study of history itself, early humans, the fertile crescent, Egypt, India, China, Greece, and Rome. Teachers can conduct the discussion surrounding each opener or appoint a student to do this while beginning-of-class administrative duties are taken care of."
1,Awful,"This product was so stale it had to be thrown out. Chocolate was grainy and tasteless, peppermint had no flavor. Horrible!!! The tin's kinda cute, tho."
3,not in English,"This product is listed as Language ""English and French"" with subtitles in English. It does have subtitles in English, but this movie is in Japanese. You will have to read subtitles. Don't be fooled by the faulty description. The movie is great. We saw it in the theater dubbed in English. We thought we were getting a movie dubbed in English since it said the language was English."
3,A really great sequel to the first.,"Death Note 2:The Last Name definitely lives up to the first and disspells the sequel curse. The sequel cotinues where the film left off. The sequel is so suspenseful that you're just biting your nails to see what will happen. Believe me, the ending will have you speechless if you already have seen the manga or anime series."
1,Rhinotek ink,"In my Epson C60 printer this ink was terrible. It requires head cleaning almost daily, usually requiring running the head cleaning utility 3-5 times. Don't buy it."
1,Don't Buy,"As much as I like to save money, I've never had a good experience with an off-brand inkjet cartridge. This one was no exception."
3,Patron saint of LA modernists.,"A valuable addition to a series of monographs from this publisher. This is Sheine's third book on the patron saint of LA modernists, following a pictorial anthology from Academy and a pocket guide for the MAK Center, and it is erudite and illuminating. If you were to buy only one book on Schindler, this should be the one. Books of this quality and importance deserve much better production values. The series is overpriced and poorly designed; the bindings are fragile, the illustrations drab, and there is not even a proper title page."
1,Nothing new,"This book had the potential to contribute to the anemic information on this fascinating early modernist architect. Instead it repackages projects and information readily available through other sources. The analysis of Schindler's work seems to border on cheerleading, rather than presenting a crticial dialogue about his ideas and built work. Check out Sarnitz's 1988 book (if you can find it) for a more intersting read on the work of Schindler. If this book aspires to the coffee table variety - which it seems to - it could have been more like Lamprecht's excellent ouvre on Richard Neutra, which is more scholarly and comprehensive. The one star received is for Mumford's beautiful photographs, which save the book."
4,An Enclave of Unique Music,"Recorded in 1979 and 1980, when Albania was still terra incognita for Americans (see the movie, Wag the Dog), Marcel Cellier took his Nagra recorder to this country sandwiched on the Adriatic between Greece, Bulgaria, and Balkan Macedonia and made a discovery of rare musical idioms that you can share by listening to this unusual album. While influenced somewhat by Turkish, Slavic, and Greek musical forms over the ages, Albania music is essentially folk, rural, and ancient. Polyphony and drones characterize it. An ensemble of flautists, as seen on the cover, produce a mesmerizing sound that must be as old as the hills. Other instruments presented are reeded flutes, fiddle, two-stringed lute, and frame and double-headed drums. Two-part and four-part choral pieces are also found here among the 16 diverse examples. If you want to hear Euro-Asian music that defies simple categorization, investigate this album and step back in time."
5,cellier does it again,"Mr. Cellier is best known for combing the archives in Bulgaria for the cream of thirties years of records to produceLe Mystere des voix de Bulgare volumes 1 and 2.Here he has brought the same fine ear to Albania, combing the vaults for wonderful representative tracks of the various styles to be found in the various traditions there. There is nothing academic is the result. This is simply a great listenable record.Just by way of example, the two tracks representing the ancient polyphonic style of Vlore are the best I've ever found. Take that as indicative of the collection as a whole. If you have any interest in Albanian traditional music, start here."
3,Flaming Lips,"The guy who calls The Flaming Lips ""soft rock"", i say one thing. Listen to Clouds Taste Metallic (the album from where Bad Days is from) and then get back to me, and say it again. Geez, i don't mind people having an opinion, but when it's as obviously wrong as the one in the previous post, it makes me wanna punch babies in the face; and i don't wanna punch anyone, let alone babies. Seriously though, The Lips' contribution to this soundtrack is by far the best song here. It's so life affirming, and unpretentious - unlike the supposed ""great songs"" from U2 and Seal (a talentless also-ran, in my opinion)."
1,you've got to be kidding me,"Three decent tracks, that's it. Once you're past U2, Seal, and the Flaming Lips (and maybe the PJ Harvey track too), there's no reason to spin this any more. If you want a good soundtrack, then buy both CDs from ""Dead Presidents""."
2,Eddie Reader is WONDERFUL on a sucko album,"The U2 song was the first one I deleted from the Ipod so I have no clue what the praise in the good reviews are about. However, after enduring all the songs on the album, I gained awareness of Eddie Reader formerly of Fairground Attraction. ""Nobody Lives Without Love"" is a perfect song to me. Crossing The River by The Devlins is the other enjoyable song on this soundtrack album. You shouldn't have to try to like a song just because there is a carcaphony of praise for it. I don't CARE if there are big names and cool indies playing on this album. I think their songs are all awful."
5,"Rock and roll, Mystery Style","The Dan Emery Mystery Band is perhaps the coolest band now playing. Their music is fast and relaxed, melodic and rockin', honest and heartfelt and funny. This album, put out by the band themselves, will be the hardest to find once they make it big - and I guarantee you, they WILL MAKE IT BIG. As good as this record is, you MUST hear the band in concert. There's no way for a silver platter to contain the energy that the band has, and thus you can only witness their full greatness when they're playing directly in front of you."
4,excellent,"awesome indie band ... in the silly TMBG, moxy fruvous genre, but completely their own sound and style ... combines sincerity w/ humor w/ wit ... fantastic combination and catchy songs ... highly recommended!"
5,Dan+Emery=Rock Music,"Not to sound presumptious at all but Dan Emery is the Jesus of rock and roll. This album is brilliantly poetic, and the songs keep me laughing. If you ever get a chance to see a live show...GO! You'll laugh even harder at songs NOT included on the album such as Mustard, Internet, and Girls of the East Village."
4,Entertaining,"A thoroughly enjoyable film, about a group of Tibetan monks in northern India trying to catch the 1998 World Cup on television. As it happens, TV is not allowed into the monastery, so they have to sneak to the local bar to watch the matches, until the abbot finally relents and lets them install a TV in the monastery to watch the games. The director is a true-life lama (!), and the movie is somewhat amateurish at parts, but this is easily compensated by the originality of the story, and by the appeal of the actors (who, apparently, are monks themselves). Far more entertaining that other movies about Tibet made by westerners (like Little Buddha, Kundun, Seven Years in Tibet, etc.)"
4,My son loves it!!!!,"I bought this game for my 15 year old son and he said ""It's a bit violent but showed no blood and it's sweet!!"" (his words)"
4,Works great with well water.,Tried Malibu at home because my hair dresser uses ocasionally on both my daughter and I. We have very hard well water and Malibu products do a great job of removeing the build up of hard water deposits in your hair. I have thick hair and it can get real dry and from regular washing with our water. I did notice after a week that it does such a good job that I had to start washing my hair every day because it wasn't dried out any more.
3,"Not the best, but I like it","Overall, the good things in this calendar outweigh the bad. One thing I noticed about the calendar was the paper. It is fairly thick for calendar paper so you know it probably won't tear or bend. Like most calendars, it correctly displays all the major American holidays, as well as a few international holidays (mostly Canada, UK, Mexico, and New Zealand). It also shows when the moon is full and half full. One thing I dislike is how simple the pictures are for each month. I really do not think they are that interesting. Most of them consist of one of the Charmed characters smiling. I would have liked more scenes from the show. Other than that, I fail to see any problems with it. I suggest only buying this if you are a real Charmed fan."
3,It's okay...,"I would only recommend this if your house is plain and has lots of wood accents in it. In any other house, this calander just does not match. It has a pleasing pallet of color, but the way the pictures are displayed is very...not pleasing to the eye. I absoutely love Charmed, but this calander will go in my laundry room-hidden away, and next time I'll just go straight for the DVDs.Lots of Smiles for the future!*Claire*"
5,excellent substitute,"I recently purchased the Rhontek cartridges RCE3011 for my Epson Stylus Color 900, and am very pleased. The quality and page count is amazing, even better is the ability to save a bunch of oney on the product as well."
5,I surprised myself by loving this!,"Okay, I have to admit that I was avoiding this. I honestly thought it was by some sort of Laurel K. Hamilton wannabe.I was wrong!This was a funny, exciting, and thoroughly enjoyable book. The characterization was out of this world (I loved these people). And she gave an interesting spin to devils and demons.Consider me a fan!"
2,Not quite ready for prime-time,The story had all of the ingredients to make for an interesting read. But too much was spent explaining all of the new techno stuff in her world. The biggest problem is she just seemed too mad at everyone. She would have done better if her character just didn't quite get along with other people. Just a little too extreme. This author has potential.
2,Leaves unsatisfied,"This book seems to have it all the elements of a successfull work - a plucky heroine, a deep mystery, revelations of unexpected past which should add depth and complexity to the character. Except that they don't. Despite all the travails Dante goes through, I never felt engaged in what happens to her. The characters just never came alive for me - they postured and went through the motions like puppets, rather than representations of real people."
3,Very good paranormal adventure,There is one thing that I find quite annoying about this book. Its not the authors fault as the Christian Theologians had messed up the titles and classification of the various critters in hell by the mid 1600s and Milton and the romantics made it worse. Among other things Lucifer means light bearer or more appropriately one who enlightens (in the Eastern sense). Lucifer was a title applied to Christ (maqybe Milton was taking a snide aside at the church).On with the review.The author has created an interesting world with some futuristic touches and has done a good job of it. (As a physicist I have trouble swallowing anti gravity [as gravity is a curvature of space/time caused by concentrations of mass] but hey its a fantasy).The characters are well drawn but only two are really compelling. The plot is pretty linear with a little humor as the villains hide out. With a better plot I would have rated it considerably higher. But its still a real good read.
2,"Prolific use of the f-word (almost on every page), and a fair amount of religious bashing towards Christians","Any fan of the urban fantasy genre knows how difficult it can be tofind books with romantic elements in them without tons of sex(PatriciaBriggs is a wonderful exception).It looks like I may have found another non-pornographic series.Unfortunately, this book can't get my endorsement due to prolific useof the f-word (almost on every page), and a fair amount of religiousbashing towards Christians ruined an otherwise solid urban fantasy.Sexual Content:One or two vague and brief descriptions of sex. A past lesbianrelationship is mentioned in a flashback with some description."
1,Depressing,If this is Urban Fantasy then I want none of it. It is difficult to believe that people actually liked this book. I am through with this author.
1,Not so much,"I always try to give a book a hundred pages before I give it a ""pass/fail"". I couldn't make it that far with this one. The best I can say is the writing was grammatically correct.I couldn't maintain interest in the protagonist, and I found myself offended that there are (at least in the beginning of the book) multiple demons without mention of a deity.The writing was good, just not my cup of tea."
4,Surprisingly fun,"I avoided this author for a long time for the same reason some other reviewers did: cheese author pen name, cheese main character name, cheese cover art.However, it popped up on a rec list by someone whose judgment I trust, so I gave it a try. It was a surprisingly fun read. I didn't see the end coming, the author writes action better than most, and I really rather liked Jaf. I think it would translate well to the screen.I'd recommend it to a friend, and I plan to read the next book in the series."
4,Bunny Trails...,"Let me start off by saying that I loved the book. Dante Valentine is an amazing character, surrounded by other great characters. She has flaws, and a heart, and kicks butt. I only wish that we couldn't gotten into her and the others a little more. And sometimes, I found myself re-reading parts because the author has a tendancy to go on about some details or important info in the middle of an event. (Which, I am not ashamed to say I have a tendancy to do as well...) But, I had brought this book with me on a family vacation to Disney World - and it's not like I was just lounging the whole time - and I finished it. The day after I got home, I ran out and bought the next four books in the series. Just started ""Dead Man Rising"", and I can't wait to find out what happens next. So, all in all, I'm glad I picked this book as an after thought for something to read on the plane."
3,The first four books are enjoyable,"Each of the first four books are fun reads with an interesting twist on demons, werewolves, magic and so forth. There is a narrative thread running through all the books, which is concluded in the fifth (last one) of the series. The last book is a disappointment, both in terms of lack of growth in the leading character and a twist at the end that I found unsatisfying."
3,It's an ok read,"If you want a description of the book this review isn't for you. Where Working for the Devil is a good book, I found it kind of boring (not slow) at the beginning. About mid way through the book it gets better. A LOT better! I will probably pick up the next book out of curiosity. I hope it is better."
2,"interesting premise, unsympathetic character","My title says it all. Dante Valentine spends too much time complaining and cursing. Unfortunate, since the plot lines are quite interesting"
3,Not bad,"It was an enjoyable read, but a bit long. The main character was completely annoying; moving from full on badass to crippled needy thing on the same page...again and again and again."
5,Working for the Devil,This is the first book by Saintcrow I have read and I just loved it. I thought the scenes and characters were rich and intriguing and the plot fast-paced and exciting. I just hated the end. This is not your normal happy-ending romance. As a matter of fact I wouldn't classify it as a romance at all. It didn't follow the normal fall in love at first sight and we all live happily-ever-after smack that normal romance books do.It did have a realistic relationship between two very different creatures that were thrown together into a difficult situation and were having to literally fight for their lives.I'm definitely reading more by this author.
3,"Great Urban fantasy, Lousy romance","This book was OK, not great. The plot was good, I really liked the plot, the characters were pretty good too, mostly. However, I felt absolutely NO connection between Japh (Jaf) and Dante. There was NOTHING between them, no spark, nothing, and we're supposed to believe they're desperately in love??? Let me tell you, when they finally had sex I was like...wait a minute..WHAT?!?! There wasn't even any LOVE between them, the word wasn't even mentioned! I liked the urban fantasy part of the book, but the romance sucked. There was more of a connection between Jace and Dante than Japh and Dante. However I DID read the second book because I wanted to see if Japh(spoiler) -----> was really dead."
2,Not exactly good writing,It was fun. And it passed the time but I wouldn't put this anywhere near my list of favorites
5,Great rafts,These rafts are perfect for the pool. Extra wide for great floating. Not flimsy and feel very sturdy. Colors are vibrant too.
4,Review on Float,I received product very quickly as always thru amazon. I have enjoyed using it and would recommend it. It is light weight and rolls up for easy storage or mobility.
1,Wave Raft hard to inflate,The Wave Raft was impossible to completely inflate. And impossible to completely deflate.I am not getting the full refund - because I am being charged for the return shipping.
5,Best float I ever had,"This is the best matt/pool float.. You can easily roll it up and take it home from the pool... pretty durable.. Second year with one and the first year with another... Looking to buy the 3rd, and 4th, for back ups. also.. it is very easy to get up on in pool, a matt finish makes it not as slippery as other floats."
1,will not stay inflated..,"i have tried filling this up a few times,must have a leak-impossible to find-due to wavy nature and small chambers..even when it is full,not very sturdy-flimsy"
5,Perfect floatie,I only like the floaties that can be rolled up and don't tip over. This one is SO easy to get on for sunbathing. I love it. It fills up quickly and to me is just the perfect floatie. Thank you.
3,Good Product,"If you're carrying extra poundage you will need to buy something more substantial. My sister who is average weight floated just fine. Also, it is not as wide as others have mentioned in there reviews."
5,Shopper,"These worked great in the apt. pool. We weren't supposed to take ""floats"" in but these were allowed. They were larger than ones found at Wal-Mart and everyone was curious and envious. Not to mention they didn't cost much more than Wal-Mart's!"
3,Not a good raft for adults,It's too narrow to get comfortable on while laying in the pool. It's okay for kids but not very sturdy. Spend a bit more and get a better one if you have a pool and use rafts often.
2,EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BLOW UP,"LIKE OTHER REVIEWERS SAID, BE PREPARED TO BLOW. A CLEAR DESIGN FLAW OF BLOWING AIR THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC CHANNEL. TRUST ME I READ THE REVIEWS AND THOUGHT ""HOW HARD COULD IT BE??"" SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND DONT BUY THESE. THEY ARE VERY HARD TO INFLATE ALL THE WAY. IF YOU WANT THEM FOR MORE THAN ONE SEASON, HAVE FUN STRUGGLING BLOWING THEM UP EVERY YR."
5,love this float for summer! Very comfortable,"We bought 3 different types of floats for the pool. This one is great for hot days when you want to lounge flat and still feel a little bit of the water. Doesn't keep you totally dry, but that's the point! Great length for tall people and nice width too! Also love the little pillow to rest your head on."
2,This is not the real Hoax,Hoax (the prog band from Texas) had the name first and these bozos use it as their name. This is blues static garbage. Stick with the original Hoax. The Hoax is still around today-been proggin since 1980. Now Broadbus is the only one left since Manholepedroza left the fold-(fired)
5,The STANDARD for DJ's,"It is true that Technics 1200's are not the only DJ turntable out there. There are, indeed, other turntables for the same price or less with more functions such as BPM counters, digital output, straight tonearms, etc . . . However, it still remains that in my opinion, the Technics 1200MK2 is the turntable to buy if you want to be a DJ. This not just because it is a great turntable (which it is), but because it is the STANDARD. At any rave or club you will go to, the decks already there will most likely by Technics 1200MK2 or M3D's. It is therefore better to own a Technics, because this is the turntable you will need to know backwards if you want to start a DJ career. If you are an audiophile, I suggest you find a linear tracking turntable. If you are a DJ, the Technics is the only one you should get."
2,It looked good...,...but it slowly faded! It made terrible sounds and broke quickly. I have had many turntables and they all worked well. For some it may work but I reccomend researching this buy further!(unless you can afford it)
2,H2Optix Windom Sunglasses,"I had purchased a set of H2Optix a few years ago and they were great! I lost them recently and decided to buy new sunglasses. I considered really expensive glasses, but found these Windoms at a pretty good price. Rembering how much I liked my previous pair of H2Optix, I decided to buy 3 pairs of these - so'd I always have a spare in case (when) I lost or broke one.The lenses on these sunglasses are excellent, just as on my previous pair. They totally eliminate glare and allow your eyes to relax. However, the frames are quite flimsy and with even the slightest torque, the lenses pop out of the grooves on the sides of the eyepiece. They aren't nearly as rugged as they are advertised to be. Regretfully, I sent two of the pairs back.I would buy H2Optix again, but not without a test drive."
3,In Retaliation To Offensive Boyz II Men Comments,"I think it's great for groups like these to produce decent music as opposed to some of the manufactured trash thats out there. What we can also do less of are Snobby Knobheads from Glendale, Arizona insulting the sassy talent that is Boyz II Men. To compare All 4 One to B2M may initally seem fair, but the fact that one of the groups are still operating and the other is not, is enough to prove which is better. The only reason that you find B2M sleep inducing is obviously because you suffer from Narcolepsy which is brought about by the raw emotion of their music, something that All 4 One Fail to do. Now take Houston's advice and SEE whats right in front of you."
2,This book is overrated.,"Even though there were some interesting points in this book, it really just put me to sleep. Overall, this book is boring, and I couldn't even finish it. I'm sure there are some more interesting books about medieval myths that I would suggest people read. I gave this book a 2 star because 1 star means that I through it away."
2,Mediocre Book on Medieval Myths,"This book was the only text used in my Medievial Myth class, and while I was at first very excited to read this compilation it soon became a burden. Goodrich has lofty aims - to bring the origional texts to the reader in her own way with a minimum of abridgement and interference. Unfortuntally the text through the whole book is just confusing. The stroy of Peredur, a distant begening of the Aurthur Legends, is so disjointed as to be unreadable. Stories are also in modern language and story form, so although Beowulf was originally a poem, it is not in this translation. It was very dissapointing to have such high hopes for a valid littery work only to be left confused by the translated text. A better work is H.A. Guerber's Middle Ages from the Myths and Legends Collection. At least that work mixes coherent modern story with noted original translation to bring home the point."
2,rather dull (it's as if they are warming up the keyboards for Postal Service),"I love Postal Service.So i picked this cd up after reading all of the great reviews.DULL. sorry folks.there is maybe 2 or 3 decent ""songs""...but the rest of the cd is just 5 minutes of a syth ""warming-up"" here and there.oh well."
4,alpha meets oval,"sounds kinda like alpha remixed by oval.[lots of cd 'skipping' effects] or maybe lamb on a month's worth of downs. with nods towards stereolab, mouse on mars, even the darkest of eno's ambient work.features more white noise, pink noise and the good old sound of equipment not grounded than radiohead could ever imagine.. even medicine might think twice.a lovely work."
3,Rotate,"Screen is bright and overall the controls seem easy to use. Digital picture frames in general are a great way to get pictures out of the camera and into a environment where people can see them and enjoy them. Overall I am happy with this product but I was surprised by one omission. There is no way to rotate (permanently) an image within the picture frame. If you rotate your camera to take a picture you will need to rotate it back using the camera or other software to get it oriented properly. Not a big deal, but I bought the frame for someone for whom this will be challenging. Perhaps not a flaw, but an omission to be aware of."
2,Not worth the price,the seller is fine. the problem is that this the instructions with the frame are non existant and it's very hard to figure out how to use
5,"WOW, unexpected",Works perfectly on a mac! This headphone is an amazing wireless system. Unexpected from an unknown brand. I like the built in microphone and it works perfectly on ichat. The design is very comfortable and it seems to hold a charge of about 6 hours from my experience.
2,sound like tomato soup cans,"Playing games like BF2 and Far Cry with these is a let-down; the sound is muddy, the direction indistinct. it feels like i'm playing in an echo chamber.Watching movies is better; you can sometimes hear the surround sound the sound technicians were shooting for.Watching live concerts is so-so.the dynamics are lackluster and the audio often feels boomy and indistinct. these cans are NOT ideal for music.In the end, I wish I'd gotten a nice set of reliable ol' stereo headphones."
3,Ain't what it used to be,"My 1970s edition of this cookbook was a surefire guide to simple, straightforward homecooking. The current edition has lost the charm -- and many of the best recipes -- of the original without gaining compensatory sophistication.Take, for instance, biscuits: old editions had the best basic biscuit recipe. The new biscuits require a special trip to the market for ingredients. Yet the cookbook held onto horrors like chop suey!The recipes over-emphasize canned and packaged ingredients and under-emphasize basic cooking techniques that might allow the aspiring cook to figure out how to substitute convenience ingredients for more complicated recipes. It's very much a cookbook for people who want to reproduce the food at the local supermarket deli, at twice the cost.That said, there aren't many basic, put-food-on-the-table-every-night cookbooks out there. If you need to smack some chicken and rice on the dinner table every night of your life, you could do worse."
5,The only cookbook you'll ever need!,"This book is absolutely fabulous. My husband gave it to me for Christmas, in an attempt to get me back into the kitchen, and it worked. Already I've taken the opportunity to go through the binder several times, and it contains a wealth of information, whether you're a gourmet cook, or a novice like myself. The cooking techniques in the beginning of the binder are especially helpful, and I've taken a lot of wonderful tips to help ensure the success of the recipies. My husband encourages everyone to try the Canadian Bacon Cheeseburgers. They're delicious."
3,Disappointing,"My husband bought this cookbook for me for Christmas last year. We have used it numerous times however my book arrived missing Chapter 6, Cakes and Chapter 11, Desserts. I love this cookbook as a whole but very disappointed its missing 2 whole sections that I WANT to use...."
3,Broken rivet on spine,"Great cookbook, but damaged. One of the rivets holding the ring binder was broken. It hangs by one now. Should have been checked before it was shipped.It was a gift, and the person did not want to embarrass me and return it.A disappointment."
5,Belongs on every cook's book shelf,"This is the perfect gift for a bridal shower, or for anyone setting up housekeeping for the first time. The only problem is that after leafing through it giving it away becomes more difficult.This book includes information and recipes that appeal to even the most experienced cook. Unlike many cookbooks that assume that the user a certain level of knowledge and often leads to frustrating (and inedible) results, or the other extreme of assuming that the user knows nothing and so explains everything but only includes basic, boring recipes that only appeal to the pre-teen set. This cookbook includes interesting recipes that appeal to the modern day palate, sections on grilling and even on freezing and canning.Buy this, buy multiple copies to give as gifts for showers, graduations, housewarmings, holidays etc but keep one for yourself."
3,Not what I'm used to with a BC cookbook,"I bought 4 of these for gifts for my children that have moved out and I was disappointed that they weren't the same color pages with pictures that I have and use frequently. Betty Crocker has always been a favorite cookbook, so I'm sure the recipes are great. I probably should've paid more attention to the details/reviews before I ordered and I'd have gotten a different version. If you need something compact, though, this is the ticket."
2,A disappointment fora fan of older editions...,"My mom bought me my first copy of this cookbook in 1988, when I first moved away from home. It was perfect, full of all of the best basic recipes and simple to make - perfect for a novice. I have loved it and used it as my go-to cookbook for 22 years..I noticed the new version had lots of newer, more modern takes on various dishes as well as nutritional info (very helpful!) - but alas, the recipes were overall a disappointment. Simple recipes were over-complicated, more challenging dishes used too many processed ingredients. I was underwhelmed. Fortunately, I still have my old copy. But I think they needed to do more careful recipe editing of this updated classic. I wouldn't have bought it had I known this. (note: this is for the NEW limited edition version of prize-winning recipes).."
5,"Very good book, esp as a present","It has a lot of picture that inspire my cooking. I also bought another for my cousin. It tells me not only about cooking but also about culture: how to choose the glass for a wine, the meaning of a dish in Italian, Spanish."
2,A bit small,"Although the book has tons of recipes, and is extremely helpful in the kitchen, it is small in size. I thought it would be bigger, but when I got it in the mail, I was disappointed. The book is not useful in the kitchen, it is too hard to cook and use at the same time. It looks pretty on a shelf full of cookbooks, and when I am wondering what to cook for a guest dinner it will be perfect. But I'll have to write out the recipe first."
5,Lisa Barrett's Books,"Ms. Barrett and her team did an awesome job.While there are literally thousands of copies of this book, there was more than one printing and only one printing had exactly what my wife wanted. Lisa was able to validate this was exactly the book she wanted. It arrived on time and in great condition.I will definitely use Ms. Barrett as my first option for all future book purchases."
4,Gift for mother,"I purchased this older edition of Better Homes ""New Cook Book"" for my mother for her birthday. She had been looking for long time to find another copy of this edition that was in good shape as hers had a lot of wear and tear from many years of heavy use. She specifically wanted this edition as it contains some of her favorite recipes that were not included in newer editions. The book I received was in excellent condition. The pages were slightly discolored from time (as expected), but everything else was in great shape. My mother loved the gift and I'm sure she has used it quite extensively since."
4,great reference,This is a handy reference for cooks just starting out and for those with experience too. This was the first cookbook I ever bought. It tells you how to cook most anything. A great all around cookbook to keep on hand.
3,A Cookbook for Learning,"I practically learned how to bake with this cookbook. I made some of my first brownies from scratch, batches of cookies, and other various desserts with this cookbook. Although it is a fine cookbook for learning basic recipes, I do not find it what I would wish to use for special occasions, and in general wouldn't make any one of the recipes I have prepared with it a second time.The various picture guides included in this book, however, are helpful when used as a guide or reference."
2,Too small to use easily...,"Like the title indicates, I don't like a small cookbook. It is hard to keep open on my counter top. I should have read the dimensions before the purchase. Buyer beware."
1,The idiot's guide to cooking,"With essential recipes like how to bake a cake from a mix (no joke!) and insightful ""emergency"" tips like how to substitute artificial bacon bits if you run out of bacon (again, no joke!), this cookbook ought to be called ""The idiot's guide to cooking"".Though the writers devote lots of space to cooking with processed, consumer-product foods, they don't spare much room for vegetarian, vegan, low-fat or other generally healthy cooking techniques. Even the most basic dishes are loaded with fat: the waffle recipe calls for half a cup of oil -- 115 grams of fat or 1000 calories right there!"
2,Average recipe book,It has a lot of recipes in it but without pictures it's hard to tempt the chef into trying them..not to mention some recipes can be complex and a photo really assists the inexperienced baker (like myself).After buying this I really regretted the decision and should have gone with a picture book instead.
1,not like the classic,"I am disappointed in this cookbook. I have a hardbound copy that has fallen apart and only wanted to replace it. The format is strange, a number of my favorite recipes are not in this 'newer' edition. I also thought the spiral bound book would wear better then the hardbound, but it is difficult to turn pages and without the tabs finding what you're looking for is difficult. Wish I had gotten the anniversary edition!"
4,The old standby is an old standby for a reason.,"I can't think of anyone who can live without a ""red checkered cookbook"" as a good friend of mine put it. This, along with the Joy of Cooking, are an indispensible pair for any household.The binder is truly a blessing in the kitchen. I love having a cookbook indexed by tabs. Of course, if you are hard on the pages (or have children who tug at pages) this is perhaps not so beneficial. The pages are obviously not waterproof, but they wipe off easily. Then again, is there any such thing as an immaculate well-used cookbook? Probably, but not in my kitchen. ;)Whether you're starting out or you are the experienced home cook and want to add a timeless classic to your library, this book is for you."
2,Disappointment,"I received this cookbook as a gift at somepoint, and it's primary use is to bookend the other cookbooks that actually get used. While it appears to be a good basic cookbook, Betty Crocker and Good Housekeeping each have their own basics which are far superior in my experience. Many of the recipes I tried in this book, such as banana bread, had errors in measurement for ingredients. Other just tasted awful, such as the devil's food cake, which with the suggested frosting is now the primary reason I can't stomach chocolate. I have been cooking since I was about 8, so for about 14 years, and have enough experience to catch some mistakes or modify seasonings, time, temperature. However, a less experienced cook may find this book frustrating. Additionally, I have never been fond of this series of cookbooks which requires you to assemble it yourself (three ring binder) and is more prone to pages wearing out."
2,Not What I Thought,"I was excited to get my cookbook today. I remember my mother's Better Homes & Gardens cookbook and this was going to be my first one. So I was very surprised to find a teeny tiny sized cookbook in the box. I have read the description again and the picture looks like a regular,full-sized cookbook, and it says that there are many pictures but this is not the one described so buyer beware. I am excited to try some of these recipes but wish that I had the full sized one."
2,Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book - Condition: New - The front cover came torn on the edge,"I gave two stars because it was described as ""new"" and the front cover came torn on the edge and with a little tape. It definitely cannot be named ""new""...it could be listed as like-new."
4,Kitchen Essential!,"My husband had this cookbook since before we were married. I am a novice in the kitchen and this has been sooo helpful and easy to use. I love all the technical explanations beyond the recipes. It is now very worn and stained (well used), several pages have fallen out and been taped/shoved back in. I'd really love to get the spiral bound version as I assume it would be more user friendly. The paperback doesn't always lay open."
3,SO-SO,"I bought this thinking it was a Betty Crocker cook book. I have tried a lot of the recipes and they are mediocre at best, nothing to outstanding. Good for a first time cook (college student) easy to follow instructions. DO NOT make the baked macaroni, this is so awful that we all spit it out except for the 2 yr old who at it anyway. I rated it a three star's because it is a book and it can teach you how to cook. But if you know how to cook find a different cook book to use, you will NOT get any compliments or requests for the recipe using this book. Needless to say I was disappointed."
3,More Info to Complete the Picture,"Read the book in two days last week (6/19\98). Enjoyed it for the way it added more detail to the story of the ""Tempts"", my favorite group ever. I have read Otis Williams book, but this one gave an outsiders view, and tells the story of the two voices most readily associated with the group, Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin, after their having left the group."
1,Pure Garbage,"Tony Turner's two books contradict each other, they stretch true stories already told multiple time, and get fictionalized, sensationalized, and Turnerized. In other words, they are garbage.The only people who he writes ""dirt"" about are dead and unavailable to defend themselves. The rest of the time he trashes Mary Wilson. Why? Because he's a disgruntled former employee who was fired by Mary years ago. It's not worth your time, or your money.By the way, Tony was sued over this book by the big man at Motown himself. Tony lost. That's why this book is out of print and will probably never come back. But if you're looking for a good read, this is NOT it. Don't waste your time. If you think its a collectible, its not, you can have my copy for free, I don't want it.Bottom line: Read the autobiographies of Otis Williams, Mary Wilson, Berry Gordy and the many other reat Motown books out there. This one isn't worth five cents."
1,Review of Deliver us from temptation,"I have just finished reading Mr. Turner's book regarding the Temptations. I think this book is sheer trash and Mr. Turner claims to have been such good friends with Eddie, David and Dennis. I don't believe he was or he would never have written what he did. I believe he has exploited them just as he said Berry Gordy did. He sounds and I believe is very bitchy and vindictive. I have also read Otis Williams' book, The Tempations in which he did not trash anyone as Mr. Turner has and is far more classy. I think Mr. Turner should stick to selling real estate or whatever it is he does. I think it's pathetic what some people will do to make money. Mr. Turner should be ashamed of himself, but somehow I don't think he is. Why didn't he pay for David Ruffin's funeral? To all of you who haven't read this book - DON'T - it will be a waste of time."
4,A beautiful workhorse.,"The Technics SL1200M3D is one of the absolute most reliable, and sturdiest tables out there. It is without a doubt, the most popular turntable for DJs in the world.However for home use it is far from delivering the best in quality sound in its price range. 90% of all high end quality tables use belt drives. The reason is that direct drive motors cause vibrations that move up through motor, through the platter, to the record you are playing, and then to the needle and out the speakers. A large source of distortion.A Music Hall MMF-5 comes in around $$$, the MMF-2.1 at $$$.Both of these turntable will out preform the Technics in qaulity.The best bet would be for a Rega Planar 2 table at $$$. This is a truly wonderful table. I own this table, along with 2 Technics 1200s (M3D & MK2)and a Rega Planar 3.The Regas are some of the finest tables in the world for home audio use. But not if you are a DJ."
1,Not Complete Broadcasts,"I just finished watching the Super Bowl XI game and it is very disappointing. The video is fine (Curt Gowdy & Don Meredith) and the fades to and from commercials are much better than previous releases, but the NFL still refuses to put out complete games. This particular game has roughly 14 plays missing from it (I lost count).One of the trickiest edits they put in was with 5:40 left in the game, the Vikings brought in their backup QB, Bob Lee. They showed Lee throwing a pass, then cut to the sidelines, then they showed Lee throwing another pass. The problem is that the second pass came with less than 2 minutes remaining in the game. They cut out about 3.5 minutes of game time in between the two passes, which included an entire series by the Raiders. Obviously, they tried to make this unnoticeable. Give me a break!If Major League Baseball can release full games that take up over 2 hours, why can't the NFL? The SB XI game is scrunched down and amazingly lasts an even 2 hours."
1,Terrible CD with horrible versions of really good songs....,"This CD is a joke. They don't even have the original artists singing the songs. The version of ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" is so stupid, I could barely listen to it without laughing. The only decent one is ""Live the Life"". Please, for the love of God, SKIP IT, and go buy a WOW CD at your local Christian music store.WWJD? He would toss this CD."
1,HATED!,"This is one of the worst Christian CD's I have ever heard in my life. I hated it. As one reviewer already stated, I hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated,hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated it. I can't believe it was even allowed to be distributed to the public. Go spend some real money on a GOOD Christian CD that is worth your time."
1,THIS CD STUNK!,"This is the worst CD ever. I wish I could take it back to the store and get something better. I hated it. Every song on here was horrible. I will buy a better Christian cd next time. Hated, hated, hated, hated it!"
4,More great sides,"This is the third volume of Basie's complete recordings on Chronological Classics. The final run of Decca sessions is here, and then the first of the Vocalion/Columbia dates. The Deccas are better than the Vocalions: ""You can depend on me,"" ""Jive at five,"" and ""Oh, lady be good"" are all Decca sides, and they are the best cuts on the CD. The first Vocalion session was a small-group affair that featured some nice Pres on clarinet. This is another CD of essential Count Basie from the early years."
4,Classic Kansas City swing,"The third volume of this great series which reissues all of Basie's classic early material in chronological order. In all honesty, I have to admit that I find most of Basie's instrumental material a bit monotonous -- the horn sections are way too punchy and the arrangements, while undeniably swank, are also quite repetitive. But the vocals...? OH BABY! With Helen Humes and Jimmy Rushing splitting the microphone time, what's there to complain about? Her voice is oh-so-sweet and he's got the soulful blues 'way down deep inside. And yeah, the singin' non-vocal tunes are also not to be ignored... With Lester Young, Jo Jones, Don Byas and all those other Kansas City jazz cats running around, this is music that has to be checked out by the true student of jazz... no matter *what* I think!"
4,More classic Kansas City swing!,"The fourth volume of this great series which reissues all of Basie's classic early material in chronological order. In all honesty, I have to admit that I find most of Basie's instrumental material a bit monotonous -- the horn sections are way too punchy and the arrangements, while undeniably swank, are also quite repetitive. But the vocals...? OH BABY! With Helen Humes and Jimmy Rushing splitting the microphone time, what's there to complain about? Her voice is oh-so-sweet and he's got the soulful blues 'way down deep inside. And yeah, the singin' non-vocal tunes are also not to be ignored... With Lester Young, Jo Jones, Don Byas and all those other Kansas City jazz cats running around, this is music that has to be checked out by the true student of jazz... no matter *what* I think!"
5,Lots of great memories...,"My parents passed their Little Orley 78' records on to me when I was young, and I loved 'em - still have 'em, but no player to use them with. I picked these up to pass back to the folks, but made sure to let my kids have a listen to them first. They love it too! We've loaded all 3 albums onto the mp3 player, and the kids take turns listening. Lots of good memories in there."
2,No Radio Edit Version,"At the time that I put this in my cart to ""buy later"", there was no Radio Edition version available in the mp3 store, only the album version. I assumed and was hoping that this cd would have it. But it didn't, so I was very disappointed. Now it is available on a cd in the MP3 store, so I am going to have to buy it, because that's the only one I really wanna listen to."
4,Rasta Bands,You certainally get what you pay for with this item. I only paid $2.99 and the bands were decent and made like three dollar bands. I would recommend them if that is what you are looking for!
2,lame,"these are pretty lame. i know they're inexpensive, but i think they're overpriced for how much i didnt like them."
4,Great book for beginners,"I'm a first time home owner and was lost when my bathroom sink began to leak. This book was/is perfect for a beginner such as myself. It gives you step by step instructions with actual photo diagrams for each step. This book is also easy to understand, which is a huge help for a novice such as myself. I was impressed at the wide range of topics covered. It covers all your basic repairs and complex installation jobs as well. This was the best book I found for the beginner (and I looked at a lot). I wouldn't recommend using this book as your only resource if your going to tackle a complex job. However, for a total novice like me this book is perfect in that it gives you the necessary information without insulting you. I couldn't give it five stars, but I wish I could have given it four and three quarters stars."
4,Great book for beginners and those who simply need a guide,"The book was a great help to understanding basic household plumbing. My friend and I referenced the book (quite often) when doing the rough plumbing stage of building his new home. It also has a lot of good insight on tying new plumbing into existing plumbing.I've never really done much plumbing, but the book helped us do the job right and pass homeowner's inspections.About the only complaint I had was the kitchen plumbing section. They didn't really cover tapping a dishwasher drain into existing plumbing for those people who DON'T have a garbage disposer. However, I did figure it out (eventually.)Otherwise, it's a helpful tool to have handy."
1,Lousy Construction,"These were great headphones at first but as the last reviewer said they break easily. In my case also within 5 or 6 months, and only on the right side. I tried Krazy gluing it back together but that was in vain because it just broke again after a few days. So then I used packing tape and that works for now but the right side doesn't fit quite as snugly against my ear as the left one does, though it still sounds fine enough. At least I got them on sale but they still should've been made of stronger plastic. Unfortunately, these are all that I'll have for now till I can get another, better pair. I've been looking at several Sonys mostly.Anyway, my advice is to avoid getting these headphones. If you do then be very careful not to throw them or mishandle them at all because they will break easily."
1,Missing Pages!,"Please Help!:This book is the basis for our weekly bible study. After going through it it is missing pages 129-164!Can you please replace the book.Sincerely,Ira Kristol"
4,Good material,"I purchased this book for a study group with my church; it turned out to be very helpful. The author has a methodical approach; he always starts by introducing one point of doctrine, then using Scripture and logical arguments to back it up. It also covers a variety of different teachings throughout the history of the Church, and compares certain beliefs of other faiths as well."
4,Lewis sings like Lauren Bacall talks,"Wow! Donna Lewis' voice is the equivalent of being stared down on a bus by a beautiful woman to the point that you either look away or faint in a pool of your own sweat. It is hard to determine how much of the voice is hers and how much is tweaked by the studio process, but the result is sensuous and soulful. ""I love you always forever"" is the chart-topper, but ""Without love"" gets my marks for ear candy of the year. This album is ethereal and haunting, and terrific pop."
3,After 3 years I suprised myself,"I had a bit of a hard time rating this album. I bought this album back in '96 on the strength of the song 'I love you always forever'. My first, initial reaction was disappointment. I listened to it a few times, and I just got annoyed by the babylike quality of her voice and never listened to it again. Now it's over 3 years later, and I put it in the cd player to listen to again, while reviewing it. I was all prepared to give it one star. But, so amazingly, I found myself quite enjoying it. It really does have pretty songs, like 'Silent World' which is just Donna's voice and a piano. So, I must say, that I am glad that I kept this album, and I will listen to it much more than once every 3 years."
1,Oh No!,"This is For sure One of the worst Cds ever- I would give it 0 stars If I could- The song I LOVE YOU ALWAYS FOREVER is very touchy and cute- But that's It! The rest of the Cd is annoyin' , Lousy, worthless..."
2,She's OK but just another Wannabe- Don't waste your money.,"i love the songs i love you always forever, without love and mother but the rest are just mindless singing. Her voice is pretty but her songs have no real meaning to them. i woulda gotten just the single if i knew what was on it but she really doesn't know how to sing from her heart. she needs to get some new, cool songs that are upbeat and funky- not corny. Just get the single."
2,"One good song, that's it.","When I bought this CD I thought it was going to be really good. Unfortunately, the only good song on it is the one I'd heard on the radio. Usually artists have SOME other good songs on there CDs. I'm going to have to say that they all were endless wishy-washy songs that she probably wrote in half an hour. If I were you, I'd get the single."
4,Quick and easy common sense approach to writing email,Tom and Nancy Flynn have put together a short book that is fun to read. The included tips and ideas will certainly help improve the quality of your electronic messages and reduce the amount of e-clutter on the information superhighway. This book should be required reading for all email users.
5,One of the most cost effective insurance investments you could make,"With e-mail now an essential business tool, using it wisely and effectively is a critical part of any operation. The smart executives conduct mandatory training programs for their employees in how to properly use e-mail and this book would serve them very well as a text for that course.The authors have managed to cover all of the essentials in a format that will fit into a one- hour seminar. It is clear, concise and thorough, so if you are in need of a course for orientation training or for the occasional refresher course, then this book can serve as the foundation for the training. In the modern world, neglecting e-mail is to dance with danger so this book is very cheap insurance."
1,company would not honor their advertised price,"I in good faith, ordered this fan, from Perl Deals, for my bedroom. I got an email informing me that there had been an error had occurred and they could not honor the price advertised. Unfortunate that they don't stand by the ads they place. I cannot review the fan because I don't have it...."
5,No problems,I was surprised how sensitive the recorder is and the batteries last a very long time. Have had absolutely no problems with it and it has exceeded my expectations.
4,College Use - Great,"I purchased this recorder for school and sitting fairly far from the instructor I was able to record quality lectures for myself.I tested the other modes to see how the lecture quality varies but I was pleased with ""meeting""If I had an external mic I think that would have helped a lot but over all I am glad I went with this recorder."
5,great audio recorder,"I use this mainly to record lectures for classes and to conduct interviews for projects. The sound quality is great and the device is easy to figure out. the device has a noise canceling setting of sorts, but it doesn't work very well, however, this was not a deal breaker for me. I would recommend one of the noise canceling microphone attachments suggested by amazon if background noise is a huge issue."
5,Great product,Recorder is very user friendly and has great sound quality.Love the fact that it comes with its own cloth case.New digital face makes reading the recorder much easier to.
5,Excellent recorder for the price,"I am a writer. I use this almost every day. I have hundreds of hours of recording with it. I have used others and they are decent.Pros: Easy interface. Batteries last long. (I used rechargeable). Decent microphone. Tons of space. I have not filled it up. Records in MP3 format. Very easy to download. Useful organization features.Cons: Voice activation is annoying sometime. The only complaint I have on this is that I use voice recognition to quickly transcribe my mp3 to text. When the voice activation software can't detect sound, it stops recording, so you get this awful, jerky, runs all together recording and the software just can't deal with it. As such, I'm forced to transcribe my self which turns into hours instead of minutes. There are no instructions on how to turn it off. So if this is going to be an issue for you, get one that will record continuously."
4,Good Recorder - wind noise is there,"Good for the price, but ones looking to use in a noisy / windy environment should look elsewhere. This works indoors better."
1,not happy,"Bought this recorder because it said it was mac compatabile. Well guess not, so far I have downloaded every program to make max osx Lion accept it like flip 4 mac etc. still no luck. Tried all search engines to find some way to get it into itunes so I can burn it to a cd. I can get it into a folder that I can play it in imovie but so far nothing tells me how to get it into itunes. Soooo frusterated. I am recording my life history with my brother so my daughter can write a book.Olympus VN-8100PC Digital Voice Recorder 142600 (Silver and Black)"
3,"Good FM radio , voice recording sound is low","I have similar opinions with former reviewer.I also have olympus VN7600PC voice recorder.but, I wanted to record FM radio, so I bought it.Radio recording is very clear, but when I recorded my voice, the sound was lower than VN7600PC.maximum volume is level30 same as VN7600PC. when I record with vn7600pc, it can be recorded much louder than WS710M.when I transferred to PC and hear the voice, the recorded voice is almost same quality as vn7600pc,that was fine with me.if you listen any sound through pc, sound quality with ws710m and vn7600pc almost same depite ws710m has stereo microphone.when you want to listen radio, you have to put earphone on the jack, otherwise it won't work.I wanted to listen radio without earphone.so, I returned it.because VN7600PC is much louder when you playback directly from the recorder.WS 710M is good voice recorder,and good small size but,price is expensive only for the FM radio functions."
5,Olympus VN-8100PC Digital Voice Recorder 142600,Very small quite useful. I bought the device for my wife to double check the motions made during board meeting when she was typing up the minutes. It replaces a cassette recorder. The digital file are wonderful she tells me for finding the spot she need to clarify.
2,Returned,"It has good features, but the play back volume was poor. I needed something that has a good volume that I can hear as I'm transfering the words to paper."
5,Great recorder.,"Great recorder, I use it daily to record lectures. Easy to use, download and listen to lectures. Instructions a bit difficult to navigate."
4,Olympus VN-8100PC Digital Voice Recorder,This voice recorder is easy to use and sound clarity is very good. The recorder is small enough to put in your pocket and is suitable for stealth recording. I especially like that I can transfer the recordings to my PC.
1,DO NOT BUY,"OLYMPUS, What a piece of crap. Bought this recorder for class lectures and it worked fine for 3 classes. After that it refuse to work, and all of my recordings are stuck on the recorder. Thanks, OLYMPUS for making me fail this class. Son of a $%^%$."
1,Didn't work,"I ordered mine for a out of town trip to record a presentation I was going to make. I put the batteries in and never got it to work... and needless to say, whether the batteries were bad (came new with unit), or I had a defective unit...I returned it... and missed recording my presentation."
1,Useless without headphones,"I have read the long as well as the short instructions, and can find no suggestions as to how to make the radio or recordings audible without putting on the enclosed headphones. Happy to receive corrections on this but I think almost anyone buying these would expect to be able to hear it play radio or play back speech through its own speaker, but no way to do this that I could find. Olympus has been in this business for long enough to avoid design errors like this; and the instructions are inadequate. But see my attributes reviews for credit where credit is due. Probably will return it, but hope for comments that rescue it!"
3,Not really worth the pirce,After seeing all of the reviews I thought that this would be great for recording lectures for school. Ii gets great sound even in big lecture halls and recording and deleting a file is easy. However to work the other bells and whistles the directions didn't make much sence to me. Even with trying to follow the pictures and the writen instructions step by step I just couldn't figure it out. So is it really worth the money? no not really.
3,Trying out for distance recording,Had bought the Olympus VN6000 voice recorder. Was not happy with recording at a distance from the speaker. Hence trying out this for use in lecture halls.
3,Not yet shipped?,"I ordered this on the 9th of January, it is currently the 14th and I chose 2 day shipping. It was very critical for me to get this as college starts on Tuesday. I'm debating on cancelling the order, I don't see anywhere on the page where it is ""not in stock""."
5,I was pleasantly surprised!,"When I bought this, I do admit I wasn't expecting much having owned a couple chinese recorders in the same price range. Wow, was I wrong to think that though!This device is fantastic! Audio quality is awesome and the microphone is very sensitive! I am thoroughly impressed with it and for the price it is the best bang for the buck.If you're thinking of buying this but are unsure of the quality; buy it, it's hella-good."
5,Great little machine to tag along.,Smaller than a cell phone with its own jacket. Good to take along. Good quality sound. Also fond it good for taking notes. Battery life very good.
5,Olypus WS-700M Digital Recorder,Great recorder and for the price you cant go wrong. I use the recorder during interviews and it is super sensitive and records everything. The little speaker is good enought to listen to your recordings in a business setting. The recorder is not ment for listening to music or for listenning to recording in a loud inviorement. Downloading the recording to a computer is very simple and if you have good speaker hooked up to your computer the recordings sound really good. For the price you cant beat it...
1,TERRIBLE!! BEFORE U BUY,I bought this product and it didn't even last a year! I had hundreds of dollars worth of lectures on it all gone. I didn't even get reimbursed. Think Twice
1,"Fuzzy and tinny sound, with little volume","Awful sound quality: too quiet for me ( I'm a fairly well hearing person. At full volume even when speaking about 9 inches away from this recorder, had a very fuzzy and tinny sound.Very disappointed. Perhaps the one I got was a lemon....? I got a Sony which has - in my opinion - a better sound.Was easy to return (thankfully!). I think I returned it about 5 days after purchasing."
2,Not for Dictation,"Although this recorder comes with a ""dictation"" mode, it lacks the ability to rewind and overwrite any mistakes. Instruction manual was frustrating because it was written for three different models, and some of the contents did not apply to this model. Might be good if you wanted to record a meeting, but that is not why I bought it."
2,Cannot be charged using the USB port,Cannot be charged using the USB port. I have to buy batteries for it which is not that cheap. My friend also has one and hers can be charged using the USB port.
1,Not arrived yet,The package has not arrived yet. It is more than 2 weeks late. I'm leaving the country soon and hope it arrives before I leave.
5,Excellent Product,"While transferring files to my Mac wasn't even something I had thought about, this works great as MP3 files. I was doing a photo shoot at an outdoor music festival and pressed record and dropped it in my shirt pocket. I was surprised at the recorded sound quality. For fun I transferred files from my iTunes onto the unit to see how the sound is. Through the speaker it's better than I expected and through headphones the sound is great. For the price this has way exceeded my expectations."
5,Voice recorder VN-8100PC,Very pleased with the voice recorder. I use it to record the choir rehearsal so that I can practice my notes. Play back through my computer is very good quality considering the low cost of the recorder. Connection to my PC was very easy.
2,Not what I expected,"In short, the recording is not good. I tried a combination of various settings. We are in a classroom with only 15 students, the teacher is maybe 10-20 ft away at the most. The 'fuzz' in the background when playing almost drowns out the speaking, which at the times the teacher spoke quietly, the recorder went into standby mode."
5,very easy to use & good quality,"This digital voice recorder is very easy to use & it has very good sound quallity and the USB cable is a must, i use this recorder in paranormal investigating and it does pick up EVPs i used it last night and we captured 2 EVPs"
3,DIfficult menus and not the sound I wanted,"Length:: 4:51 MinsThis is my youtube review of the Olympus WS700. And yes, I eventually did return it and got the Zoom H1. It suits me better.P.S. The thing I was referring to in the video that I didn't like was ""Low Cut Filter""."
2,Frustrating recorder,I found this recorder very difficult to program and lost one whole meeting notes because I thought it ready to record when it was not. It required my 21 year old grandson to figure how to do it. I really wanted a simple on /off to record a meeting. The description on line did not give explanation on the difficulty of programing for a novice user and the machine was much too complicated for a non-digital machine user.After I have recorded a meeting successfully I may change my mind.
2,Careful what you're ordering,"My fault for not scrutinizing the product specifications carefully enough. Unlike other similar Olympus digital voice recorders, this model does NOT include the capability of storing and playing back MP3s. As I was seeking to replace a unit that did have this capability, this is a waste cost for me, as I don't have a valid basis for returning it. The WS-510M is what I should have purchased."
1,digital recorder,This item does not meet my needs. It does not have an edit/overwrite feature. I tried to use it with no success. Luckily I was able to return the second one that came with my order since it was not opened.
4,Awesome Recorder,Great little recorder. Love the fact that you can plug it into the usb on your computer and drag the files off. USB recharges the batteries on the recorder too.
5,Awesome Response Time,Love the digital recorder. got it for a great price and I got it in the mail so fast that I was shocked. Great response time and incredibly fast service. I will definitely use them again for more orders.
3,Not Clear,Not clear at all. I had a 4100 that works still and is much clearer. Would not recommend this product.
3,olympus ws 700,does anyboyd know if this plays back in it own speaker ive read ten recorders and they dont say i dont know what withthe people who sale this stuff but seems thy want you to guess weather it has speakr to play back or not typical new world asses
1,worst ever,"I have been using a digital recorder for recording phone conversations for five years now using a direct line from a telephone adapter, resulting in a mono recording. All of the previous Olympus recorders we have used-DS-2000 and LS-10 could record in this way without distortion or buzz. But the WS-700M consistently results in a loud buzz and very little volume for the voice sounds. It also has an intermittent scratchy sound throughout the recordings.The scratchy noises also happen while recording with the mic's. But, what can you expect-it was made in China...."
4,Olympus is awesome!,"I record meetings and document information on a daily basis. Thanks to Olympus I am no longer spending the extra time to convert files to an MP3 format from .wav files. Thanks for the freedom to add transcription software if that were still a requirement for official minutes. I know in a pinch if I am unable to attend a meeting I have the availability to load the data onto an iPod and catch up with any important points or research information for my boss or clientele.Great sound quality and the option to switch from note taking to meeting size gives the recorder a better idea of the range of sound and cuts through the re-verb. Great product, can't wait for the next surprise from Olympus."
4,Very Pleased,"I have never owned a recorder before so I am not aware of what features are cool and whatnot, however I really like this one. It is very easy to use and saving it on my computer is a breeze. It also records really clear, even at a distance from the source. Hope that helps"
2,No good,Volume is very low. Plus it doesn't allow to put names to recorded songs only numbers. Call tech support they said that only folder name can be changed.Send it back.
5,Excellent!,These work great for recording calls and playing back to coach employees on sales techniques as well as recording meetings for notes later...perfect!
5,A great little voice recorder.,"The Olympus VN-8100PC Digital Voice Recorder 142600 is a fantastic divice. We bought this recorder, and recieved it the day before it was put to the test. Needless to say it did the job with no trouble. The voice quality was excellent,so was the ease of use. It does all things Olympus says it does. I recomend this product without reservations. I bought this voice recorder through Amazon.com,great job Amazon!!!!"
4,quite satisfied,i like everything about this product except that it doesnt have a function where u can pause in mid-recording if you don't want to record a long period of silence
5,"Great digitsl recorder, easy to use, good price","I needed a digital recorder to capture mentoring sessions with a fellow teacher so I could share them with her and also keep for a potential publication. The sound quality and ease of use are great and I am very pleased with how quickly I can download it on to my computer. I can highly recommend this product, especially the price."
2,"Decent quality while it lasted, ultimately a bad purchase","Purchased this item for my son who is a college student. He was very pleased with the quality, but just two months after purchasing this product I am having to return it. Started out by freezing and having to remove the batteries to get the thing to start back up. Then today it simply just stopped turning on.Look else where for a solidly built voice recorder."
5,Must Have,This is one of the best digital recorders available. I had a Sony Digital recorder earlier and I rate this very high above the Sony.The UI is also better than Sony.It comes with a neat cover to safe it in.
4,Product works well,Gets the job done when recording lectures. Sometimes it gets hard to hear when you're far away from the front and the teacher is lecturing at the front. The mic picks up almost everything from people rustling paper as they get it out from their notebook.
3,Incomplete Package,"When i received the package, the outer carton of the product mentioned that the box contained the batteries and the carrying case as well. However, the box did not contain either of this. I am surprised. I believed in shopping with Amazon trusting its brand credibility. If there are exceptions on the product, i believe it would help if it is clearly specified on the website.Of course, when i bought the product, the site had no mention about the carrying case. I therefore spent money separately to buy this.So i am now unsure, which is true. Did the site miss out to mention about the case or was the packing compromised.Amit"
2,Constantly having to reset it,"This thing was good at first but I am definitely hating it now. The good features are that it records in common (mp3) file format and is accessible like any other USB device. Both are handy features.The bad features are that it constantly freezes. Yes, a voice recorder that crashes, folks. I constantly have to open the battery compartment and take a battery out and put it back in so it will reboot. I then have to reset the clock. So basically it's a POS. I don't know if I just got a bad one or not. I'm going to try to return it, but it's been a while since I bought it. It took a while before this behavior started occurring.I'm not happy."
4,Very good recorder; needs USB 2.0,"Have used this recorder for several months. It has very good sound, lots of options (lots of menu levels to navigate), good battery life, small but highly usable size. Will charge included NiMH AAA battery while connected via USB (need to change menu setting for regular alkaline AAA, so it doesn't try to change). FM radio Ok, but needs headphone leads to work as its antenna. Startup is sometimes slow as memory gets filled. Only significant improvement it needs is USB 2.0; for whatever reason Olympus chose USB 1.1, and download to a computer is glacially slow with large/many files (i.e. ~30 min with 5.5 Gb)."
1,poor product,"I expect a lot better. When I received the product I was a bit disappointed. It's so cheap look designed, not like a picture. The functions are so tedious."
3,inconvenient,It has an inadequate interface. Why it asks me to press OK to start charging?The level of recording sensitivity is low. And it is hard to listen to it without headphones.
5,great recorder,"It's really easy to use and if anything records too well. It picks up all the paper shuffling,coughing and sniffing as well as the professor. I'm not complaining, I'd much rather have it record everything than skip in and out as some recorders I've had will do. At first I was really intimidated by all the stuff on the display, but I quickly learned to focus on the most important parts -red light means you are recording!"
5,A handy toy !,An extremely handy device for recording the details of photos taken. It eliminates the need for a notepad and pencil while in the field too !
4,Olympus WS-600S Digital Voice Recorder - 142610,"It is very tiny and works extremely well. My only complaint is it has a real cheesy case which gives it the feel of a cheap piece of equipment, but it really works great. This product demonstrates that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Great electronics in a crappy case."
2,not worth the money,"the volume on this recorder sucks.and forget recording if you are trying to record like guitar lessons,because it ain't happening.the color is very pretty but looks don't do the job. i was very dissapointed with it."
4,Olympus WS-700M Digital Voice Recorder 140152,I have been using this item for recording lectures at school it is easy to use and the recording quality is good. It has a usb connection and cable that comes with it and included rechargeable battery can be recharged via laptop.
5,SImply the Best,I use this unit daily to record description of matters I work on. It has superb sound quality. I have used so many different brands over the years. This one is the best unit I've used.
4,just what we needed,"The Olympus Digital Voice recorder was purchased to record sermons. The side bar for power on and off is a little confusing, but the recording quality is very good, and it easily synchronizes with the computer. We like that it can record many hours in MP-3 files. Works great, and has features we'll never use, but thanks for a product non-techies can appreciate."
1,UNRELIABLE JUNK-- Short lifespan. Agree with other 1-Star reviews,"Mine quit in 4 months. Just stopped working. Turns on just doesn't do anything. When it did work at about $20 bucks a month, was Okay, but what pocket recorder isn't! This recorder is hype! - it's a cheap y for $80.00."
1,won't work---bad product,"I have hardly used this recorder-thought new batteries would do the trick-had several mechanical people look at it---it simply won't work! Not happy would like to return item, but its too late"
4,WS-710M Voice Recorder - Good but could be better,Good product - Lots of features but one AAA battery is not enough ... should have another AAA battery so that you can play back recordings with greater speaker volume (top volume of speaker is currently on the weak side)
5,Good product...,Very good cocktail spoon. Sturdy. Our only complaint is that each end is super small and it falls through the dishwasher rack easily. But overall we love it.
3,Okay.,Will do the trick. I thought being metal it will be a lot thicker and stronger.One side of the spoon is very flexible. will not buy it again.
1,I'm not sure how to review this,"If you liked ""the days of wine and roses"" and anything earlier by the syndicate, I doubt this album will sound good to you. I'm not saying it's not good, it's just no way near as powerful or moving. Do not buy it if you thinking it might be another ""days"" it's not. It is good for what it is, but should not be labelled as ""The Dream Syndicate"". I only gave it one star, but that's because it wouldn't let me put none."
4,roman a clef of life in a global bank,"a thinly disguised view of the banking revolution authored by john reed at citibank in the late 1970's. his willingness to shake up the traditional ways of processing paper and transactions has a very human side. this book was written by an insider who knows of what she speaks.of great interest to those who worked for and with citibank during that time frame. of mild interest to those who want to see what goes on in the multinational corporate world. you can guess at the real identity of the players, but not knowing ""who is who"" does not detract from this enjoyable read."
4,fascinating look at corporate world and ancient tech history,"Cashing In would be worth reading just for its insidery portrayal of (and obvious experience with) corporate shenanigans and the business world on all levels. Reeks of truth down to its descriptions of New York. The real gem here, though, is an inside view of the rollout of AutoTran -- the ""revolutionary"" practice of transferring funds online. The tech language usedin this book is surprisingly modern-sounding and the technology itself so advanced for the time that I knew it had to be an inside story, probably told under a pseudonym (hence no more Antonia Gowar books, unfortunately!). Thanks to the previous poster for making that Citibank reference, I've alwaysbeen curious about what's behind this book."
5,I love Bruce,Bruce rocks in all his weirdness. I have had this cd for years and love it. Bruce is my hero.
5,This CD is a riot!,"This CD is hilarious, and even if you've never heard of Bruce McCulloch, or the Kids In The Hall, as long as you have a good sense of humor, you'll agree with me. Way to go, Bruce!"
5,Pure Brilliance,"As a huge fan of KITH (Bruce is my fave), I bought it on impulse (couldn't help it). It is absolutely the funniest THING I could ever imagine. Vigil is my personal fave, about Kurt Cobain's death, but That's America, Lift Me Up, and Stalking are awesome too. Baby Jesus is a guilty kind of humour, but ABSOLUTELY hysterical. Actually, the whole cd is hilarious. It's wrong to make me pick. If you don't order this, I will never speak to you again, and I mean that. If you can only buy one thing this year, buy this. (you can always find food crusted to your TV screen- besides, it's better than food, and more nourishing)"
5,Just the sound of Brucio's voice,"Just the sound of Bruce McCulloch's voice was enough to make me go out and buy this cd-joygasm! This cd reflects Bruce's intelligence and his dry and insighful sense of humor. The music is just as amazing as Bruce's poetry. if you have enjoyed Bruce's monologue's on KITH, then you will love this cd! -katie"
1,Shameful,"I'm a huge fan of The Kids in the Hall, and of Bruce McCulloch's work on the show. This disc, however, along with his other spoken word/song disc, Drunk Baby Project, is drivel. It sounds like something a junior-high kid would put together. Boring and not funny, these discs would be libelous if they weren't put out by McCulloch himself. I must ask: Why? Painful on first listen, they're doomed to be a terrible memory, never to be lived-through again. Oh, for the good old days."
3,Almost good!,"not exactly aworthy effort, but it wasn't horrible exactly either.Some I heard on the show, and some I hadn't!Some were good, and some were not so good.Almost good Bruce! Keep trying.Almost perfect, but not quite."
4,Good toy but grandson only mildly interested,Balls are a little mis-shapened. Good quality though. My grandson is only mildly interested in them. Great for indoor play.
3,Just got today but really impressed,"We got this for my sons first birthday and even though he hasnt played with them yet I am really really impressed by the quality and size. I knew they would be larder but I didnt think they would be actually life sized, maybe I missed that in the description but I was very pleasantly surprised. The mesh bag seems really well put together and I am glad it will hold them in securely since it also has a velcro strap as well."
5,"Large, plush, and a great price!",These pillows are bigger than I thought they would be! They are well-made and really nice! They fit in perfectly with my boys room. If you are looking for ball throw pillows get these! You won't be disappointed.
3,Somewhat Helpful,"Delivered on time and in the condition stated. There are some important works that are not included in this textbook which you may have to search for elsewhere, if you are taking a History of Photography course. Otherwise it is okay."
3,Great watch for the price,"I've been in the market for a blue dial watch for a while and it's hard to find a good looking watch with a budget less than 200 bucks. This swatch watch looks good in person. It's well made and the dial really pops. The bracelet feels great on the wrist. What I don't like about this watch is the bracelet design, the domed crystal with the edges above the tachmeter ring (which means it can potentially get damaged easily if you wear this often), and the push buttons look cheap.About the seller, Dexclusive: The watch arrived with the second hand ticking and the watch case was damaged and had tape on it...This is a big no no...A brand new watch usually comes with the crown pulled with a plastic holder and the second hand on pause to prevent wasting the battery. I was surprised that the watch came like this."
5,EL RELOJ QUE YO QUERIA!,"Hey es tal como esperaba que fuera el reloj, me encanta! Y bueno es servicio de watchzone es excelente, rapido y eficiente, lo recomiendo."
2,Good concept but doesn't work well,"We were so disappointed in this product. It was a socking stuffer for our 2 year old who loves to color with crayons and markers. It takes FOREVER for the color to show after he's colored. At least 30 seconds, sometimes longer. That may not seem long, but for a toddler thats an infinity. He's long since moved on by then to coloring another area or gotten frustrated ""its not working mommy!"". We have a new baby coming next month and I was hoping for a coloring kit that I wouldn't have to be as hands on with. This is the perfect idea since it really does only work on the special paper and there's no chance of him destroying his clothes or the furniture, but delayed gratification is just not something a toddler gets very well. Plus its expensive for a coloring book and 5 markers. Thinking we'll stick to washable markers and I'll just strap him in to his booster seat at the table."
5,Great for travel,These were great to surprise my 2yr old son on the airplane. He loves markers but mess for me :)
4,Cute,Markers don't last very long. The coloring pages were cute and had a good variety. My daughter enjoyed the item.
4,Better than the 1991-1993 era Genesis albums!,"A very complete and rewarding pop album with hints of pomp and progressive,this endeavor demonstrated once again Mike Rutherford's exceptional musical skills and his abilities of choosing outstanding vocalists and top-notch side musicians.A winner!"
2,I was disappointed with this CD. Mike and the Mechanics have jumped the shark with this CD.,"I always have high expectations when I hear anything from Mike Rutherford. His work with Genesis and early solo work have set the bar so high that anything less then great is a failure. So be it with this release with a few ""not bad"" songs, a couple of covers and basically a very forgetable CD without any great tunes jumping at you like the other Mike and the Mechanics albums."
4,The Mechanic's Best,"I'm not usually fond of songs that contain whistling, but ""Over my shoulder"" is just a wonderful, gorgeous song! In fact, the entire album is great. The title song is a plea (of sorts) to take a good look around and see just exactly what you DO have going for you.But I must admit I bought the album on the strength of one song, the beautiful and haunting ""Something to believe in"". Not trying to be sappy, I can't help feeling the song is telling us that no matter how bad things seem, or how bleak the world can be, having one person who loves you, and is loved by you, can provide shelter and calm, and help maintain sanity. Mike and the Mechanics (if they still exist) will probably never make another album as good as this, nor a song as wonderful as ""Something to believe in""."
3,How brief is too brief?,Too brief for my taste .I think this is not therapy but Hokus Pokus.Therapy is evidence-based and holistic; brief therapy is like talking to your friend.
1,Gossip and Nothing More!,"I have been a fan of the Mandrells for many years, and have followed their personal and professional lives for quite some time. Having met all of the Mandrells on several occasions, I know that most of the information contained in this book is false. The author apparently didn't get his information from credible sources. Although some of the info is true, the majority of it reads like he ripped it from the headlines of grocery store tabloids. The Mandrells are a strong family, who has certainly seen their share of heartache with failed marriages and Barbara's accident, but they remain true to their roots and supportive of each other. This book tries to stir up pain regarding the family, and is not worth the money to burn it."
5,Energy of Money - Excellent!,"I am just finishing reading this book for the third time. This time I took the time to study each chapter thoroughly and to complete each one of the exercises. I have to admit that this is rigorous study of the book, and it's been life transforming. I've studied the book with a partner. We talk each week by telephone to share what we see about how the information in the chapter and the exercises apply to our lives. There is something so powerful about telling the truth about what we see and how it's affecting us, our energy relating to money, and our lives. One action I've taken as a result of this study is to clean my garage (with the support of my husband). For the first time in several years I can park my car in the garage - and there's breathing room from having many fewer belongings which, for the most part, I wasn't using anyway. I'm also accomplishing my goal of writing a book I'd wanted to write for about six years - with clarity and ease! How good is that?"
2,The Energy of Money,I received this book on audio cassette as a gift. Apparantely I am in the minority but I found this book very difficult to follow without becoming distracted. I felt like it was written for the psychology profession instead of the general population. It was repetative and lacked intrigue which made it difficult to keep listening.
1,"Boring, for the financially unsavvy","I read this book ast part of a group, and all five of us agreed it was one of the worse books we've ever read. Here are two problems:1. It's written for ""the lowest common denominator"" of people who haven't really given thought to their money before.2. It's a slow read. The writing is full of the author's newly-coined terms that read like a college thesis.After reading the first half of the book I started skimming the rest. It was painful to turn the pages."
5,when one song is enough,"just on the strength of ""Gesso's Guitar Song"" alone I give this CD 5 stars - never heard anything quite like it"
2,A little history but not much more,"Space Sailing by Souza contains a little history on the topic of space sails, but not much in the way of details such as construction, deployment, or control. My suggestion is save your money and buy the book by the same title written by Wright."
3,Promising - Push deeper,"The book begins with wonderful promise, identifying the four key elements of the new economy: business arrays, lattice organizations, global mindsets and speed. These are indeed the key elements, but Mills does not push hard or deep enought to really mine the context he has well described. For example, how do arrays relate to electronic marketplaces and portals? What are the values really needed for the new culture? And with speed, this means our firm needs to connect electronically with other firms to seize the opportunity, what of XML for example in helping this to happen. Then the book throws in a couple of unrelated chapters with no tie into the rest, and it finished with a weak ending. We certainly expect more and Mills is more than able to give us more depth and wisdom. Keep at it!"
5,Awesome CD,"I first saw Lao Tizer and his band perform in Arizona at a big street festival. In short..they are awesome. Without question the kid can play the piano and his band rocks. I don't think I have ever seen a better band in my life. What makes it even more special is the fact that it's all instrumental music. The CD is a fantastic combination of upbeat original pop songs and some really cool mood altering solo piano pieces that make you just want to sit by the fireplace and have a glass of wine. There is no question in my mind that this young man is going to hit the big time. Run...don't walk to get a copy of ""Golden Soul"", I promise that you too will be blown away."
3,Did the job but the smell....,"I used this in my Ford pickup truck and it did clean up the stains but for some reason it left the terrible smell while it was drying, though i remedied that with some sweet smelling oil. Would give it 4 stars except for the smell."
3,Read like a journal,"I enjoyed this book, but it seemed more like I was reading directly from the author's journal. The author would be writing about an event and then abruptly end the paragraph and start a new one on a completely different topic. This aside, the book was a good read and gave a insight into her time in Guatemala."
5,WHERE AWAY Book,"Great book for those interested in Naval Warfareat the beginning of Word War 2.This book has first been published in 1940,it is the story of the USS MARBLEHEAD.Andre Rodot"
5,Metroid Fusion,"this is an absolute GEM of a game that everyone with a GBA should definitely buy. (speaking of which, is cheapest at this website).The coolness factor is overwhelming and the gameplay is even better.Seriously folks, i bought a GBA just for this game!!!Fantastic stuff!!!BUY NOW. Thats an order."
4,this is too short,"i liked the classic metroid gameplay but i beat it in less than 2days.i also like the new wepons like the ice missle.But the game was also really easy.overall, its a good game for a road trip."
3,A pretty good game,I was debating on wether to give this game a 3 or 4.All together it is a fun game but the only 2 problems i have with it is that there are to many secret passages and to many things to figure out if u buy this game u will probably find ur self putting bombs EVERYWHERE just to find the secret passage wich is boring but thats what u usually have to do. Another problem is that once you find 1 passage you have to find another right after that.
3,"Super Metroid, it is not","This game was highly disappointing. It is extremely linear. Basically, it tells you where to go, and locks off all other areas of the game. The attempts at making a story are poor and contradict earlier Metroid games. This game does have its good points, however. The play is similar to Super Metroid. It is also nice to be able to play the original Metroid, although if you want to play the best in the series, play Super Metroid."
5,A Great Action Game,"This was my first Metroid, but I loved it. The game has solid gameplay mechanics, simple but interesting story, and addictive elements to it--such as the addition of new powerups to Samus's suit as you progress through the game.For any action game fan, I highly recommend this game. Metroid fans don't even need to hesitate picking this game up. Even though it was released over 5 years ago, it has aged very well and is still very fun."
4,wait ????/,let me clear up the story the discription is wrong samus when she is infected with X crashes her ship and is injected with METROID dna (from the super metroid )and her suit is removed and modified by GF. And her suit parts are sent to the BSL where they become SA-X which frees X into the statoin .Ironicly Metroids are X predators so samus is able to absorb them to gain lost abilities and energy but she gains a weakness to cold which leaves her venrable to samus-Xs ice beam so you have to avoid it until the showdown...
5,Another from a great game series,"Metroid games have always been fun to play, Fusion is certainly no different. The only beef I have with it is that it only took 5 hours playing time to win. Granted, I reportedly only found half of the secret objects, but that proved to be enough to win. Replayability isn't very high as the story doesn't change, but I might play it some more to see if I can find all the secret objects."
3,"Metroid is back again, but... where are they?","Well I've played the game, and eventhough it's a metroid game, It has not effected me like the Super Nintendo version of Super Metroid. I would have liked Nintendo to release a direct port of the Super Nintendo version, than make a new version of Metroid.The Graphics are not in par with the SNES version, and Samus doesn't look as good as well.The Gameplay is just like the SNES version which is a good thing, but it's short lifespan means you won't be playing this game anymore after this year."
5,Great game!,"I pre-ordered this game and when it came, I was ecstatic! It's a GREAT game that will keep you coming back for more! First time through, it took me 5 hours 20 minutes without a guide, so I played through it again, and then another time, and now, I'm playing through it for my 4th time, it's just that good! And that completion time does NOT include all the times I died and had to restart, including those, it was easily over 15 hours! The graphics are great, and there are only a few things reminiscent of Super Metroid - mainly the bombs and missles which look identical to their Super Metroid counterparts. The control scheme took a minute or two to get used to, but after that, it was perfectly natural. The sound is great, the presentation is excellent, and as for gameplay, it's addicting :-) It's the first Metroid game I have actually owned, but in the future, I intend to buy every one that comes out for my GBA!"
4,Metroid,the games grafics are brilliant the game play is great this game truly kicks butt I bought It a few weeks ago And I love it although the under water level is kinda difficult but I still love it
5,This game is awesome,This game is the best metroid game ever!!! It is better than Metroid Pime on the Nintendo Gamecube. You should deffinetly buy this game because it is fun and isn't very hard to play.Reccomended age 10 and up.
5,"Fusion, More fun than a barrel of Metroids","I can't say enough about this game. It happens to be my first GBA game and I tell you this, its the coolest Metroid game to date, other that Metroid Prime of course. It had an extremely odd storyline, and I was a little saddened at the destruction of Samus's 'cruisemobile', but hey, I didn't write the game, I only played it. This is a definate must buy for any metroid fan, new and old. Its a bit difficult to progress right at the beginning, but its well worth the 30$."
5,x infection alert x infection alert,This game is superb...1-you can link it with a Nintendo Gamecube Metroid Prime to get some really cool bonuses.2-the game itself is really cool because you get so many cool upgrades and at the end of the game you actually get to fight a real metroid(an omega metroid)3-Nintendo Power didn't help me much except for extra missiles and secrets4-my favorite thing about it is getting chased around by the SA-Xwhen you enter Sector 2 the second time
5,"(If I could choose 1 billion stars for this, I would do it)","This is a continuing of my last review. The one that said I can't beat the spider thingy, uh huh, that's the one. Well I got farther this time! Way farther! After tou beat the spider guy you have to get past SA-X. Then you have to fight this plant guy which you get plasma beam from. Then you have to fight nightmare wich you get the gravity suit from. Then the sicurity robot is back except he's infected by X this time. Very easy!! Then you have to dodge all of the metroids and get to this place. Then you fight Ridley wich you get the screw attack from. Then you you have to kill Sa-x and fight Omega Metroid and I'm stuck near there. I recamend tis game highly."
5,Sets a standard for GBA action game,This is a truely awesome game. Every aspect of this title is great comes together to make a masterpiece of the game. The graphics and animation really show off what the GBA can do. The music really gets you into the game. The tight controls keep you from getting too frustrated. The story and the gameplay will keep you coming back.
4,"Fun, but too short and no sequence breaking.","Ah, foo. I played Zero Mission before this one.I think it kinda ruined the experience.Graphics: 87%The graphics are great. 'Nuf said.Sound: 65%Is it just me, or are the music loops shorter than inany other Metroid game? Sound effects are fantastic though.Story: 54%FOO FOO FOO FOO FOO!!!!!!!The opening cutscene is way too long,and Samus says cheesy stuff. FOO!!!Gameplay: 95%Dang good. The wall jump is suck though.Also no squence breaking. FOO!!!Overall: 75%Worthy of the title metroid, but only just.No sequence breaking sucks. Foo.PS: Foo is bad. Duh."
4,Good Game,"<Graphics> 5/5 Well, this is my first GameBoy Advance game (just got SP the same day) and of all the other GBA games ive played this has got to be some of the best side scrolling games garphicsever. The exploshins are very detailed and so are the enemys.<Sound> 5/5 Supurb. Wow. Excellent.<Gameplay> 3/5 Sometimes youll find yourself beting the game in under 2 hours (i did). and it so fast and the story line isnt that great but it leads to some cool action"
4,"Starts slow, ends with a bang.","If you like action games, you will love Metroid Fusion, if you stick with it. At first the game will go very slow, and may bore the living poop out of you, but once you gain some new abilities you will see why everyone gave this rave reviews. A Definate must have for Metroid fans."
2,Good game but short comming In @ 5 hrs & DEFINITLY not worth $80,"Just wanting to put It out there that this game,just like every other Metroid game ever, IS good...but this game Is VERY short & NOT worth the $[...] that the current seller is selling this for.The reason I'm giving this game such low stars is because of the length."
2,Worse Metroid Game yet,I Have played many metroid titles and this one is the worse i love metroid but this onw sucked this game is harder than metroid prime i am stuck on a boss called shadow When you kill a boss it has a second VERY powerful form if you kill it you need the kill the x that controls it! THE BOSSES ARE VERY hard.
2,Boring side scroller,"Metroid Fusion is a classic 2D side scroller adventure. You walk around a maze and jump up and down to complete each objective, on the way blasting away aliens/mutants/ugly videogame characters. I appreciate its ease of controls vs. Castlevania, the latter requiring you to press all the buttons at the same time. The graphics is also among the best I've seen, and finally visible on the sidelit screen of the SP. But games like this are pretty boring after a few minutes, and if you are good you can beat it in a couple hours, with little replay value. Try renting first."
2,Pbbbbbt,"Instead of writing a full review [i dont think it is worth the time] i will give you some words that describe the game.DumbSlowEasyShortCornyStupidUnoriginalIn other words while at [a local store] for 2 hours i was able to complete the entire game. In my words, ""go get a real game""."
5,Cant beat these metroid games,"Metroid funsion is the fourth chapter in the metriod series. It is very similer to super metriod (metroid 3) by ways of controls and graphics, so if you are a true fan, it's like dialing a telephone. you should also buy Metroid prime (see my review there also) and a ""gamecube to game boy advance connection cable"" to unlock secrets for each game. PARENTS: this game has no gore and no blood that ive seen, but it is a little violent."
5,Metroid Fusion,"This game is a great example of what a top notch game should be , when you play this game you will not wander around wasting time because you always have a clear objective and can feel like you are not wasting time like with so many games on the market the graphics are great and the story is well written, and this is what I strive for as a game designer in my work, I have seen my share of games and you won't be sorry if you get this one trust me , but I do suggest getting a guide book or else you may be in store for a headache, good luck and spread the word about great games so us gamers don't waste our money."
4,Metroid Fusion Rules The GBA,"Metroid Fusion is a great game that is the forth in the series. It comes after Metroid(NES), Metroid Prime(GC), Metroid II: Return Of Samus(GB), Super Metroid(SNES), Metroid Fusion(GBA)! Metroid Prime is not included in the official count. Metroid Fusion includes a great storyline a lot of 2-D action that is famous with the Metroid Series. Great Game I highly recomend it."
5,"Complex, but kickass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","i got stuck on this game so many times its not even funny but its still a KICKASS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you get tons of weapons, missles, and you fight your own clone- how cool is that(sorry for the spoiler :) anyway i highly recommend it its fun"
4,Falls a bit short compared to other Metroid games...,"While this game is highly enjoyable, it falls somewhat short of 'perfection' when compared to most of the other Metroid games.I wasnt too fond of Samus new 'look' and the fact that this game pretty much holds your hand and tells you what to do next and where to go next. It makes you lose the sense of free exploration that the Metroid games are much known for.Still, this is an extremely solid and well made space adventure that should keep you occupied in its 3-5 hour mission."
5,"Bones, but not the Right Body","Glynn Marsh Alam keeps the tension tight with smooth almost lyrical story telling in BLIGE WATER BONES, which is the 4th installment in her outstanding Luanne Fogarty series.Plot elements include a not so innocent frantic father who's son's body is not discovered after a boating accident, the tug of two men in Luanne's life one of whom she is trying to help reestablish his ability to dive after an underwater explosion almost took his life and the introduction of new characters who live in the swamps but have fallen through the cracks.As with all of Ms. Alam's stories the setting becomes a major character. This is one mystery series that doesn't get stale.Nash Black, author whose books are also available in Kindle editions.Sins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelWriting as a Small BusinessNatchez Above The River: A Family's Survival In The Civil War"
5,great depiction of North Florida,"4th in the Luanne Fogarty series, which take place in the northern, swampy areas of Florida. Luanne is an assistant professor in linguistics at the nearby University, but she supplements her living by diving for the sheriff's department in the rivers and caves that penetrate North Florida. Luanne prefers her privacy, like most of the denizens of the swampy area. The mystery begins with the disappearance of a teenage boy whose family is influential in the area. The authorities are searching the river for the boy when they happen upon an old boat - with a skeleton. Suddenly they are working on more than one case. Luanne is trying to deal with her lover from the sheriff's office while at the same time trying to help her former lover recover from a diving accident, which is causing a little bit of tension. Add into the mix a crazy naked lady appearing haphazardly in different parts of the swamp, and you have an intriguing, descriptive mystery to enjoy."
2,"No plot, no adeventure , no nothin!","This book has excallent art and fun charaters but my point is there is no plot no adventure or anthing! This story is about a girl named Akira who is sixteen but ats like she is seven. What I mean is she's like ""yeah Mr.Snowbug!"" and acts like a child. If the story was about Akia (Akira's best friend)the story would be alot better because she acts her age and is a really fun charater. What What is really sad is every chapater is about something Akira did that was special to her but the stuff was like metting a snow bug or in the first book washing a gondala. *snore* And Akari is baby-ish as ever. I can't really say the book is terrile because some people like these type of books but books I recamend are Tokyo mew mew, Rayearth and Pretear because they actullaly do something!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchchased this item online at ANTonline via Amazon.com. The price was great but now I know you get what you pay for.The item arrived on time. I excitedly opened the package to find a defective headset. (the earpiece was broken away from the headset.) At this point I owned the product for about 3 minutes.I called ANTonline to get a replacement only to find they couldn't do that. I had to return the item at my expense and re-order another and pay shipping again.I returned the item, paid for the return shipping and did not order another.Now I am out shipping from and to the supplier and have no headset.I am very disappointed."
4,The Man Behind the Myths,"This is a carefully researched and written book about a controversial figure in American church history. The text is fully documented and was a pleasure to read. Some of Dabney's outdated ideas on race were disturbing to read. His service before, during, and after the Civil War as a leading academic in the U.S. was interesting and insightful."
2,Struggled to get through it.,While the book certainly did tell me more than I knew about R.L. Dabney the manner in which it was written can best be described as dry and academic which made reading it all the more laborious.
3,A period piece with good acting from Genevieve Bujold & James Caan,Although the movie is a bit drawn out & loses the viewer's attention; it's worth buying if u r a fan of Genevieve Bujold & James Caan
4,AMAZING Live Set!,"Recorded around the same time as their debut album, The Move perform a set of covers of other bands' tunes here, and make them their own. The sound has never been the best here (anyone who's seen a local band playing a bar show will understand) yet despite this the sheer POWER that comes across makes the MOVE album seem tame by comparison. The MOVEMENTS box set included 3 songs not on any earlier version, plus a longer, ""unedited"" version of ""Sunshine Help Me"" instead of the one originally included on every previous reissue. Frustratingly (as I already have the box set) this particular CD features both! Ah well... My faves here, though, are ""Something Else"" and ""It'll Be Me""-- which blows Jerry Lee Lewis right out of the water (so to speak). I'd also recommend THE BBC SESSIONS, on which several of these tunes turn up done in studio for the Beeb-- with somewhat better sound quality."
5,"Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy, Joy will Come!","Most folks of Boomer age will instantly recognize ""Oh Happy Day"" as a popular radio tune.... Moving into the album from track one you get a rich, mellow piano intro and Choral blending of "" Let us go into the House of the Lord""... an instant balming wash of goodness... turn it Up! A couple of fast clappin' numbers later you are at My Favorite... ""Joy, Joy""... If you are looking for some Godly assistance, this tune is a magical blessing you should take a moment to enjoy. I get teary-eyed just thinking of how much you and I need this kind of music in our lives. We keep it on the Disk carousel all the time at our house... Send one to your friends in need."
3,Oh happy day,Not exactly the right one! the one we remember and listened to way back when...do enjoy a couple of the tunes
5,review,"great product, i'm overweight and these feel very comfortable to apply weight too, i will order more products from company"
5,Something Different,"The Girl from Montana is back with something totally different - Swing music in the 1940's tradition, supported by a small club-type ensemble. This is definitely not Western Music, but Stephanie shows that she can handle this kind of material with the same honesty and feeling for the song. If you want to try something different, try this one. It is impossible to get away from this record with a bad mood!!!"
4,Insightful and enjoyable - a rare gem.,"Academic by nature, this book ran the risk of reading like a doctoral dissertation. However, Malin cleverly sidesteps that trap by infusing his work with humor and insight into the relationship between modern man and popular culture. The result is a piece worthy of scholarly recognition, yet accessible to everyone. A true rarity."
3,Could be better. But it works.,"The first one I received was defective. The vendor replaced with no hassle (I think it shipped from SportsMansGuide).I've had parts of of it break off about every other month (Spring, track bolt, handles).Handles: they are really cheap metal and will bend on the first log you try to split. Pour in some sand to strengthen.The hydro jack is set a bit low and tends to push the log upwards instead of towards the wedge.Track is a bit short can't cut slightly longer logs."
3,log spliter,"Nice low volume manual splitter requiring a little arm muscle, but for the price it is a good buy."
1,NO GOOD!,Manual Deluxe Splitter is not good. I think I could get things done faster with a chainsaw and an ax. I will send it back! Get an electric one!
3,Nice Price For Long Reaching Headphones,"The Philips HP250 Headphones provide a very tinny sound but the bass response is pretty good for the price. Undoubtedly low quality drivers were probably used which lead to the tinny sound these headphones generate, but at this price point it's not to be expected that you would receive studio-level quality.Comfort level on these headphones is very good, as I could wear them for hours without any negative issues. Volume control on the cord is nice to have, and the cord is long, long, long which I personally believe is the best selling point of these headphones.Nowhere near the level of quality of a pair of Sennheiser headphones, but also nowhere near the price. With a better than expected bass response, long cord, and comfortable fit, it's not a bad deal for most buyers.*** RECOMMENDED"
2,Lacking Sound,Not much to say as the headset lacked good sound. Had to turn volume way up past normal levels to hear sound.
1,Guess the author has NO children!!!,"Oh my, what was the author thinking? Sorry, but this series is just horrible! While the sound words are fun, what those books seem to reinforce and deem acceptable is misbehavior, which is not appropriate. After having read this particular book, my 2 year old son thought it was okay to slam the cabinet doors, answer with a moody ""What?"" when called, bang the spoon on the table, throw the spoon through the air, and pull down the tablecloth (just to mention a few). Maybe someone should tell the author that kids at the age this book is targeting love to imitate and copy what they see and hear!"
5,Preschool level book,This is a wonderful book for preschoolers and there is a great lesson in it as well as beautiful pictures.There is a big difference between fast food and a fancy restaurant from how we dress to how we are expected behave and this Froggy book details all of it. The pages also kept my little one highly entertained.
3,froggy,"This is a fun to read book. But I was hoping it would help teach how to eat with manners in a fun way. I would not recommend the book for that. The message in this book is ""don't try to take your kids to nice places"""
1,Froggy ACTS Out !!!!!!,"We inherited a bunch of ""Froggy"" books from a relative, and I have to say, they are being promptly donated! The messages they give are not happening around this house. In Froggy Eats Out, you basically get ""Act up when your parents take you out and they'll just leave the fancy restaurant and take you to go get a hamburger, since that's what you really wanted anyway""?!?!? No way, if my kid acted like that, one of us would promptly take him outside to wait in the car, until the rest of us are finished.This is just one example of the ""Froggy"" books."
4,Great book for 3-year olds,"This is a great book for my 3-tear old grandson. Some reviewers seem to think that all children's books must teach a lesson, which of course is not true. This book is not intended to teach kids table manners.It teaches kids a more important lesson: that their family loves them even when they are not perfect. And it can teach adults to lighten up and don't take life so seriously! Enjoy your kids (or grandkids) while you can."
1,Disappointment,"This Software does not live up to its promise in any way. Might be useful for small home video projects but in no way would I use it for professional and complex projects, maybe in a few updated versions it will get better. Encore is unfriendly to the user. Had to use separate software for transcoding and burning, In Encore both failed on large projects. Complex projects seem to be hard for it to handle. I was surprised and disappointed at Adobe for releasing such an undeveloped tool, we all know they can do better."
3,HOW DO I BURN A 2-HOUR DVD?,"The software seems terrific, despite the steep learning curve. BUT HOW DO I BURN A 2-HOUR DVD? I am using Adobe Preimere and Adobe Encore 1.5. I made a 73 minute video that practically took up an entire DVD. I just tried to make a video that runs 1 hour, 45 minutes, and the program tells me that I have exceeded disk capacity. Is Encore capable of burning a two-hour video onto DVD as do even cheaper programs? Or am I doing something wrong? Am I making my files two large? Can anyone help me? I would welcome any feedback or corrections. - JV - (...)"
2,Rotors that Peel????,Did well when first installed with GreenStuff Pads. Less than 3 years and 20K later I got a vibration in the brake peddle. Went to change the pads and the rear rotors where pealing... Never seen it before but the metal was peeling off in chunks. Glad I looked at the first sign. It could have been bad. I don't know how they build rotors at EBC but I have never seen anything like this.
4,Harlem's dance band,"This was the great Black dance band to beat for Duke Ellington. And many in Harlem thought he didn't manage it. And if you think Gene Krupa is the top drummer of the Thirties, maybe you should think again.These tracks are simpler than Ellington's, but still of considerable interest. Those composed or arranged by the fine alto saxophonist Edgar Sampson are especially worth listening to, for example ""Stomping at the Savoy"" and ""Blue Minor"".Chronogical [sic] Classics did a good job on this one; all the 78's appear to have been good copies and the transfers and remastering came off well."
5,Book explains concepts well,"Immunology is not an easy concept to digest at first, but luckily this book explains the difficult topics quite well. With any subject that deals with explaining molecular processes, both the descriptions and diagrams take great importance and I feel that this book for the most part addresses both very efficiently."
2,it's a used one,I bought it as a new book but it turned out to be a used one! There are marks in the book!
5,The comic side of daily life in Israel,"Israel's most famous humorist here provides his usual comical look at daily life in Israel. He also provides in the title piece a stunning and humorous defense of the David which became to the world after the Six- Day War , Goliath."
3,too heavy item,this is a good book.... but you have to order it alone. it can damege other items in the same box. be careful!!!!
4,Great for dogs!,"I bought this for our dogs outside water - It keeps the water unfrozen irregardless of the temperature, definitely worth the price. The cord is nice with the protection for chewing and the size is just right for what we wanted."
5,Nice smaller heated bucket,We bought this bucket for our two goats. Winter was harsh this year in NJ and this bucketdid a nice job keeping their water from freezing in the barn.
4,"Pricey, but a necessity","Does what it's supposed to, in even the coldest weather. And deep enough that my geese can really dip their heads in, which of course they love (in even the coldest weather)."
4,a good guide for progress but little skrewed,"as a how to book for the more esoteric practices of yoga not bad,simple and direct explanations & exercises. and yes it is intense but doable.what I find skrewed is mumford's explanation of the yamas and niyamas they are little off. I would refer you to the yoga sutras or the thirumandiram. both are much better guides on the philosopy. bisides that overall a good booknanmaste"
1,Caution,"Kundalini is an extremely effective practice, and it is absolutely NOT something that should be learned from a book. Dr. Mumford's emphasis on fast results, and ego based gratification is a dangerous way to begin exploring your body's energy, and there are dangers in practicing the pranayama he advocates.This topic should be explored with a teacher-- fast results are not always good results."
2,Im a beginner,This book was very detailed and also very difficult for a beginner like myself to follow.
1,Crappy Book,Wow is this dude high on himself or what? Step off your pedestal and explain these concepts in a way that us uneducated fools can understand.
2,They could be better.,"In my opinion these are not very good speakers for the serious persuit of sound. Their cut out levels are way to low. They cringe at the very signal of bass. According to their supposed stats my reciever gave them less watts than sufficient yet they cut out constantly. The thing that gets me is the protection circuit cut out woofer output more than anything, like the highs could handle more than the woofer could. So if your serious about sound reproduction these are not for you.Thats all I have to say about that."
1,Surprise,Technics is by far the best name in the business. That is why these speakers surprised me. They are terrible!
2,"Good name, but they should stay out of the speaker business.","I have owned Technics products for over 25 years. The quality and capabilities of their electronics, whether you look at Amplifiers, Receivers, Turntables, CD, tape or Equalizers have all been comparable with the biggest names in the business.Unfortunately, their loudspeaker/audio speaker systems have always been weak when compared to ANY other brand of home audio above the 'El-Cheapo' brands. This is something that was true when I first bought them, and it is true now, when I compare to the newest available.If you want good audio electronics, you can't go wrong with Technics... If you want good audio Speakers, look elsewheres."
5,The True Holy Liturgy,"Jazz is many things to many minds. MJQ's music, such as this fine double, occupies the very hightest strata of musical nourishment. The compositions of John Lewis, represented here, have guided this listener through personal and national calamity & grace equally. Their music is in my bones. The swinging is so sublime. Their tonal pictures are soft and easy through the changes. This particular album is for me nearly tied for first. That would be their European Concert done weeks earlier in Scandinavia. May they soothe the Collective Soul forever."
1,Not a good value with the price of the 10/100's so low,".This was an outstanding product in it's day. But given the present very low prices for linksys 10/100 PCMCIA cards, I don't recommend it.Why buy old technology when new technoogy is just a little bit more money.Check out the Linksys PCMPC100 EtherFast 10/100 Card . My choice for a PCMCIA network card. It is also for sale on this web site."
2,Linksys LAN card Review,I purchased this card about 11 months ago and I've been having nothing but trouble with it on my Hitachi Visionbook laptop. The price is right for what you get. The coupler that connects to the PCMCIA card is very delicate and flimsy and for me a mobile user it broke after 3 weeks and had to be replaced. Later broke again after 6 months. The card its self is VERY frusterating to install if it doesnt want to work the first time. I am a certified Cisco Network Analyst and I've never experienced problems like this on any PCMCIA card. Installation can take 3 seconds to 11 hours. I'dd highly recommend looking at somthing different.
4,Good value,"This card has worked fine in my notebook running Win98...As the reviewer below says, the 'clip' that holds the RJ45 & coax socket onto the PCMCIA card is a bit flimsy, but mine still works after nearly a year of use."
2,Dongle too fragile.,"Thanks to the reviewer above for telling me it is called a ""Dongle"". The card worked fine, until the connection to it broke. Get a new one where the line connencts directly into the card."
1,This is a ...,"I used it for two weeks and I had to return it to the store for a refund. It did not work in my Mindows ME notebook with a Linksys Router (BEFSR11), and it was very unstable in my Compaq iPAQ 3650 as well."
5,A must have for any level of interest in physics,"The Feynman Lectures on Physics is a great series of books to introduce one to or review the basics of physics. Though Feynman's original ideas are vivid & easily understood, this extended edition expands further still on his concepts. Since Feynman's creation of this series it's become a staple in the physics community. Having been scrutinized carefully, and for so long, this edition offers many updates and includes details beyond those of previous editions. The box set also includes an additional book, ""Feynman's Tips on Physics"" which is not a part of the regular 3 volume set."
5,STOOD THE TEST OF TIME,Caltech had unbelieveable foresight in knowing how good Feynman would appear to future generations. The teaching techniques are still unbeatable. Worth spending six months reading these.
3,Ok set,I bought this for a class that required it. I actually never used it because it didn't apply to much that I was studying. I'm sure its a great book otherwise.
2,Low Quality Product,"The Feynman Lectures on Physics is a classic that must belong to everyone's library. This edition is very well designed, but the paint in the cover keep getting off into my hands. The cover of my Volume I is already totally ruined. You don't buy a book if you do not intent to read it. Disappointing."
5,Truly a brilliant teacher,"I'm a physics major, and whenever I had the chance and needed to reference something, rather than looking in my own textbook, I would check in this book first. Professor Feynman is the most brilliant professor that may ever live. This series is incredibly easy to read, with diagrams and descriptions that draw a very vivid picture in your mind. A must read for anyone interested in physics."
5,just bought it!!!,"I just got this volume the other day and started reading right away. Dr. Feynman was truly a genius. However, I find the paper and the binding to be a bit annoying and bulky. I wish the publisher would reduce the dimension of the book a bit so it's easier to carry around."
5,Feynman once said...,"Physics is like sex - it may lead to practical results, but that's not why we do it.^_^"
4,A Book Set well Done,"The set is well done with very few mistakes, and a different approach to physics than most texts."
3,hammond street vol. 1,"Good hammond stuff, also obscure stuff, good compilation with several numbers from different periodes. Hammond street 2 till 4 contains also rare and good hammond stuff"
2,Disappointed in quality of prints,"I learned about this book from a review in the ""Lands End"" catalogue, of all places, and was thrilled by the quality and depth of the prints. I thereupon decided that I had to have the book. However, I was really disappointed. In my opinion, the prints reproduced in the book do not come anywhere close to the quality of the prints in the Lands End catalogue. The prints in the book look washed out and blurred, whereas Lands End prints were sharp, with plenty of detail."
5,Reba VHS Video's,I loved this VHS of Reba's video's. Brought back years when she was one of the most popular female country western entertainers. Buy it! You'll love it.
3,Good quality but disappointed!!!,"I bought it for my 5yr old daughter for the ballet. The quality is very strong and soft. It had been worn and washed 3 times and still good and soft. But I was very disappointed because it doesn't have toes and heel areas. They just cut in the middle of length and sewed it. So when my daughter wears, the angle of her feet looks ugly. It shows lots of wrinkle with extra fabric sticking out from her angle. I was expected the feet area of the tight should be just like regular shock shape or adult tight. But not this tight."
5,The best ever,THis CD should be in every home! All the mantras you ever need in you life are here!It trully harmonise the environment around you and you.If you are interested you can find the whole text of this mantras on the Internet with the english translation.
2,Disappointing Mantra Fails to Deliver,"I've gotton realy tired of mantra CD's that have spoken commentary insisting that ""what you about to hear are magical mantras conveyed by the gods"" and that ""they are so powerful all you need do is listen to them with an open mind"" and then all these supposed blessings & life-changing experiences will be yours--with no further effort required. Yeah, right--IF ONLY!The commentary in this CD goes so far as to say that ""modern science"" has actually proven the reality of these supernatural claims.I just happen to like mantra music.Unfortunately this CD is neither unique or demonstrates any particularly impressive technique.I wasn't so disappointed as to actually throw it away (that would have garnered only a single star. The Amazon format requies you rate at least 1 star or your review will be ""spit back"" to you for correction.)So if you're not a total mantra freak (like me), I'd give this one a pass.Chants Of India: Ravi Shankar; George Harrison"
5,Mean Machine baby!,"Now, I don't own this CD, but I have heard ""Mean Machine."" I think it is an upbeat, rocking, energetic song with lots of beat and feel! I imagine the rest of this CD will be someone similar! Buy it today!"
3,Sugar Ray's first CD is a bit dissapointing but still good.,"I thought I knew Sugar Ray. Then I ordered this CD. I was shocked when I saw the cover and the Parental Advisory on it. Sugar Ray has sure changed a lot, haven't they? They're new CD, 14:59, is full of great party tunes like ""Someday,"" ""Every Morning,"" and ""Abracadabra."" This CD, however, is loading with screaming hard-rock tunes and roaring guitars. That's the probelm with this CD, though, they concentrate too much on the guitar riffs than the actual lyrics. The best songs on this CD are ""Snug Harbor,"" ""Rhyme Stealer,"" ""Mean Machine,"" and ""Streaker."""
2,not a very good cd,i kind of liked this cd but if you want a really good cd buy 14:59 by sugar ray. It is my favorite cd in the whole world.
5,Absolute power makes you giddy,"I know, because everytime I crank this outrageous CD I start laughing maniacally like some mad scientist! This sounds like if you put the Beasties, AC/DC, Pantera and Soundgarden in a blender and added a dash of funk. (your ingredients may vary, i'm just goin' with what I know.) My local radio station used to be cool back when this CD was first released - i know because they used to actually play ""Mean Machine""! The band can make all the simple inoffensive commercial [music] they want now - this HEAVY LOUD FAST and FUN CD is ALL the Sugar Ray I need!"
5,This CD ROCKS!!,"I got this CD four days ago, and i'm already in love with it! My fav songs are ""Iron mic"" and ""Mean machine."" I was looking for it for like 2 months.Well anyway,if your thinking about buying this CD,DO IT! It rocks!Yeah!!"
5,Rocks like h*ll!The best Sugar Ray CD there is.,"This is the real sh*t, you teenie-bopping queers.This is to all the pop-loving freaks out there,that like Sugar Ray because of songs like ""Fly"" and ""Every Morning"".YOU SUCK!This is the real stuff.This is the album before they started doing it for the fame and money.If you like 14:59,but don't like anything on Floored other than ""Fly"",then you won't like this CD.All the songs are mostly rap/metal,there are four that sound like R&B music.Even so this CD is there best.True Sugar Ray fans should buy this,but the pop fans shouldn't even get close to it."
3,The Sugar Ray you don't hear on radio...,"Not sure if anybody else said, but the cover model is Nicole Eggert of Charles In Charge and Baywatch fame. Nice shot I admit. Now musically this debut is heavier than what the name Sugar Ray brings to mind. Think something like The Urge or Limp Bizkit. It's what you get when hip-hop and metal collide. Of course it's still Sugar Ray, so that sound is in there too. Like alot of people this is the only disc by them I own. I mean between the music, the cover, and a song title like ""Danzig Needs A Hug"" how can you not love it?"
4,This is *not* Music for Cougars!,"It's a bit of a shock to first hear this vesion of Sugar Ray, the one before the wild success of ""Fly"" turned them into a sunny California pop band. Though I appreciate some of their later material, Lemonade and Brownies is a different beast altogether. It's loud, raucous, fast, a bit rude, and a totally different kind of fun on this album. Did I mention loud?Just make sure you listen to the samples first, so you know what you are letting yourself in for."
1,Let down!,"I love 14:59, and am so disappointed this album sounds like a totally different band. I find it strange those who like this album are begging Sugar Ray to return to their old sound. Their old sound flopped sales-wise. Their record label was about to drop them because of the disappointing sales from this album, and what were disappointing sales for their next album, until FLY was released as a single. It's their new sound that is why they are not now flipping burgers for a living."
1,Sugar Ray should be Diarrhea Ray,"this album stinks. it needs a shower. mean machine and rhyme stealer are the only good songs. other than that the album reeks like farts. don't get this, it smells like CACA so stay as far as you can from it"
5,this cd is pure alternative!!,"wow!! this cd is really good, and the songs just rock. it's too bad that sugar ray had to change there sound, and sell out to the teenybopper fans. songs like mean machine, iron mic, dance party u.s.a, and 10 seconds down just rule. i really wish that sugar ray would make another cd that sounded like lemonade and brownies."
5,It's what the real Sugar Ray is!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best CD's out. I've had it since '96. This puts a mark in how they should have stayed. IF U don't have this CD, go out and buy it NOW. U won't be disappointed. I saw them in concert and they only played one song off this amazing CD and that was Mean Machine. I really hate that crap they have put out since. All the new stuff is is tready music. They might only have a couple good songs since this amazing CD came out. GREAT CD!!!!"
4,Now What I Was Expecting,"Becoming a Sugar Ray fan with when ""14:59"" came out, I decided to get ""Floored"" and ""Lemonade and Brownies"". Boy, was this not what I was expecting. This was out and out, bad @$$ rock.It listened to it a few times, and it just isn't my cup of tea for everyday listening. However, when I've had a bad day or am doing some heavy duty cleaning, I pop this album in."
5,NY MPRE Pieper Review and Exam Book,A thorough and comprehensive study tool designed for NY MPRE (testing standard in NY is 85% to pass). Easy to follow and plenty of questions for examination as well as 3 full practice tests with detailed answer explinations. EASY to remember Pieper MPRE Mnemonics essential for rule memorization.
3,Very Slow Delivery,The item was carefully packaged to insure that it would not bend during transit -- Top marks for packaging. Downside -- took over 2 weeks to receive item. This was somewhat inconvenient since I needed item sooner than that. I would order again from this store if I could tolerate waiting 2+ weeks for item.
3,It's OK. There are others that are better for less.,"The Cyclone is OK. You should know that I purchased a Shark at Toy'R'Us for[..]and it is superior. It shoots farther. The Cyclone's capacity is more, but more is relative. The Shark has good capacity and it shoots a good 30 feet plus. The Cyclone shoots 25 plus.You choose."
4,Mitchell outdoes Rice and then some...,"Mitchell gets better and better with every novel and she is way ahead of the queen, Rice. She sets the story up, paces it, and makes us identify with her characters. Honestly, I never have been a big vampire fan because most of it is too flowery and wordy. But Mitchell breaks it down and writes in a straight-forward way as not to ""over-write.""She can write with any of the other splatter-punk's, too; she writes in an orgy of blood and gore. She writes with just a hint of sexuality and sensuality, keeping us wanting more and more.Her ideas are fresh and very well-thought out and planned. She writes like a bat out of hell and composes her fiction in a literary manner, but not too wordy.Mitchell is one of the few female writers in the genre that is truly gifted and can deliver chills and shivers down your spine."
2,Dissappointing...,"I saw this book and I thought, hey, Lord Byron... gotta be kool. I was dissappointed, for this book didn't speak to me at all. The characters were underdeveloped and it was too fast paced for my tastes. There are parts and aspects I did like however, but not enough to make me want to read more of the subject and author. Being an Anne Rice fan, I think she has spoiled me and this book just seems to me another plain ole vampire novel.If you are interested in Lord Byron as a vampire, I suggest Tom Holland's work."
1,A good book for those with a short attention span.,I bought the book in a drug store on impulse. I saw the title and read the back. It seemed like a good concept so I bought it. The character development is brief and half assed and everyone seems wrapped up in thier own little dramas that overlap poorly. The book moves rather fast bouncing over the storyline whith not much attention to detail. Still I found the book tollerable for a boredom read though the ending was badly done and highly dissapointing.
5,Shelf-stable probiotics are a must for us,These have worked well over several years of usage. They keep their potency and work well for me and my husband. The Amazon Prime delivery system keeps us getting these in a timely fashion every couple of months.
5,Works the best,I'd been using this product for a while and wasnt sure if it was still doing it's job so I switched to another product I could buy locally. No time at all that I realized the switch was not a good idea and I went back to this product. Thanks so much!
5,Amazing Product!!!,"I have had the most horrific, painful constipation for about four years now. I've tried laxatives but realize they are only a temporary remedy. Longer term, I used a stool softener, and it worked for a while. However, at some point many products that only treat symptoms gradually stop working. Desperate to try anything that might work naturally, my sister told me to try Jarro-dophilus. Of course, I was skeptical. But, within TWO DAYS I was ""regular"" in a gentle and very friendly way. I was still skeptical. I figured many products could work short-term because I had been through that before. So far, this stuff has worked reliably, every day and for nearly a month now. I'm ordering my second box now and thought I'd share my experience with others with the same horrific affliction that I was suffering."
1,Did not help my IBS symtoms,"My wife purchased this for me to help me with my intestial issues and cramping.Unfortunately for me, it did not help. I ran out of my old product and wanted to try something new for the heck of it but this had no effect on me and I started to feel sick as my old symptoms came creeping back. I am sorry but this just is not for me."
5,Still over the top,"My older brother turned me onto this album when it first came out. I got home and caught it at the end of the first song and asked him to restart it which he did. Whoa man. Out of the speakers came the music of the gods. It is my opinion that this may be the greatest, soul-filled, rock n roll album ever made. I burned a hole through 2 vinyl copies so it was great to see this CD issue with the extra tracks. The extras are not needed but are a nice plus. I am in heaven with this terrific sounding disc. I keep searching for a new vinyl edition though. Long live vinyl and Leon."
5,"""Hmm, lemee see here...""","Those of us who owned the LP know this is how side 2 leads off -- Leon gathering his thoughts before dropping his hands on the keyboard. It's very likely that Leon did the vocal and piano in the same take. And I would also suggest this is very likely how much of the album was recorded -- with most if not all of the musicians recording at the same time. Risky business, because it requires that one actually be able to sing and play his instrument. And they do.But the magic at work here is the intimacy Leon creates. These are live performances captured in s studio. Fortunately for us the tape was rolling.Leon went on to pen and perform many more masterpiece compositions, but if you have to choose just one album, I suggest this is the one to have. Forty plus years later I keep coming back to this. It is timeless music.""Wont you stop and listen to the children sing?"""
4,Holy humor,"I love the shape and cover design of the book--an arched stained glass window. On the Internet, there is an online community of religious leaders called Ecunet ...... A popular topic on Ecunet is Eculaugh, ""the place for good clean religious humor."" Judging this book against the Eculaugh standard, most of the jokes are clean, many of the jokes are good, and all of the jokes are religious. Catholics, Protestants, and Jews are equally picked-on in this compilation of religious humor. If you can laugh at religion and overlook the occasional ""R-rated"" joke, then you will enjoy this book."
3,Got the clubs there and back...,"So far this is the only hard case I have seen which has the ability to shrink which is extremely convenient. So far I have used it one time with mixed results. The clubs were kept safe, but one of the locks broke (there are three) and a clip which keeps it collapsed for storage broke. The three spin locks are a great idea but just don't seem sturdy enough."
1,Have had MAJOR SCREEN PROBLEMS,"I am happy that most people who gave good reviews for this tv are happy, sadly I am not one of them. I bought this tv back in march 2008. two months later, a red vertical line showed up on the screen. I called Lg since of course it is under warranty and they sent a repairman to diagnos the problem. turns out the entire screen had to be replaced. so, they replaced the screen and that very night, I notice two purple spots as well as 3-4 other shadowing spots on the screen, this really angers me because the second screen was ordered directly from LG. I am in the process of trying to get a refund and I want to get another brand of tv. I am sorry , I have heard that LG products are good but In my case , it has been nothing but a bad experience and I cannnot recommend this tv."
1,Terrible picture from high-quality sources,I couldn't believe how dark and muddy the picture was on this TV. I tried with the HDMI and component from a high-quality Sony system. HDMI certainly looked a lot better and I could scale the image to the native resolution of the TV and it still looked awful. Adjusting brightness and contrast just washed out the picture and made all the blacks gray.
3,Beware of being mislead,"Overall I'm satisfied with this product (especially since I got it on sale at Best Buy for $999.99), but I would not pay full price for it. I did my research and understood that you need HD cable to get the full experience. Our local cable company however only offers 19 channels. The difference between a ""regular channel"" and an HD channel are drastic and I'm extremely disappointed with the regular programming. The picture is grainy and distorted dramatically, people looked smooshed in the frame and the graininess is so bad I feel like I need new glasses. So when I watch HD programs and Blu-Ray dvds I'm blown away, but then I just get sad when I sit down to watch something ordinary like Jeopardy."
5,Amazing!,"Wipes off make-up with ease. Water proof make-up is harder to take off tho. No stinging, irritating or drying the skin. Also, no oily residue. Love it and I would def recommend it! It's worth the $."
3,doesn't remove mascara,"i dont understand people who say this stuff is great, it doesnt even take off regular mascara let alone waterproof. plus if i get it in my eye accidentally, it burns! so much for gentle. it does, however, take off foundation well without stripping my skin or breaking me out. rinse with water after, even though it says you dont have to, because it tastes HORRID if you lick your lips."
4,Bioderma,"This product is great it removes my makeup efficiently and it does not burn my eyes at all! I will use this all the time and the big size lasts for months which will help me save money in the end because i wont go buy five packs of makeup wipes. Overall I love this product, although a slight amount of it did leak, it was not too much and it was in a bag to begin with so it didnt get all over anything else that i purchased at the time! Would highly recommend it!"
4,"Cost effective, and it works","The product is very gentle and effective. You don't really need to rinse. And it's a good value. The only problem is I don't think it's that effective for my japanese mascara, that's why give it a 4star."
5,Well-worth the money,"Like many reviewers, I first read about the Bioderma Crealine cleansing water from renowned make-up artist, Lisa Eldridge. I've used make-up removers on and off and didn't really think they were necessary if you have a good cleanser. (I also use the Clarisonic brush three times a week). But once I heard that Bioderma cleansing water is used at all the fashion shows and for celebrity shoots and is a staple for make-up artists, I decided to try it. I've used it for just two days and I absolutely love it! It removes every ounce of make-up and leaves your skin feeling refreshed without that tight, dry feeling. I use a cleanser afterwards and find that I don't have to use a lot because the Bioderma does such a great job."
5,Best Eyemake up Remover Ever!,"I found out about this product from Lisa Eldridge who is one of the top makeup artists in the world.[...]I feel that if she uses it everyday it must be good because since she has access to so many products and also because she is in the industry she has tried many. So I gave it a try. I used to use the Clinique eye make up remover and comparing the two, I found that the Clinique one was too oily and could have the tendency to get in my pours and cause problems. The Bioderma Crealine H20 solution feels like plain water but it takes all makeup off within seconds. If I have false lashes on all I do is apply some to a square cotton pad, press pad on eye for about a minute then just slide the pad down everything comes off without any rubbing or pulling your eye. Plus, it helps to not wreak the lashes so you can use them again and again. It is an amazing product. We all know it is so important to not rub the eye area anyway. We want to prevent wrinkles not make them!"
4,bioderma crealine H2O ultramild non rinse face and eyes cleanser,"I liked this product. I never have this one before. I will buy again when finish mine. Maybe it is no so hard to take off some make up hard, but to me it is ok."
4,Very happy with this product,"I've been very pleased with this product. I like that it is unscented, lightweight and my skin feels fresh after I use it. It doesn't work particularly well on waterproof mascara, but does well with all other types of make-up I've tried it on. I will be buying it again in the larger size."
3,An overrated product,"This was quite a splurge for me, and I had build such high expectations for it, that when I used it, I was so disappointed. I wear waterproof mascara and eyeliner, and I have to scrub and scrub and scrub to get it off. By the time all the makeup is off, my eyes are super irritated and red. Maybe it's too gentle, or I got the duped version. I have to use a lot of the product to get the makeup off, and for me, this is not worth the splurge. I would much rather use Clinique take the day off for the same price."
2,Theoretically sound; practically... no no no!,"I really wanted to love this product. The description and science behind Crealine seemed perfect for my sensitive skin. (And the idea of it--washing your face without water?! So bohemian!)Unfortunately, my face was covered with tiny, dry, and itchy bumps the day after the first use. I stuck with the product for about 1 week, only using it in the morning, and the bumps remained. I wanted to blame the hot weather, but the cause was definitely the Crealine! I immediately went to see a dermatologist afterwards because it made me intolerant to all of the products I had previously used (jojoba oil, aloe vera gel, and Cetaphil).If you have normal skin (i.e. not acne-prone, not eczematous), I think you should try this product. It's theoretically a great idea, and a lot of people seem to really love it. But if your skin is extremely sensitive, I would stay away from it despite it's claim of being effective on sensitive skin."
5,love this water removing make up remover..,"This is wonderful.. love it removes my falsh lashes and does so without burning or skin redness. I love this.. I must say, I owe a lot of what I buy to Lisa Elderidge, she researches and tell you what to expect, and so far, she has not led me wrong with the products, either high priced or highstreet as she calls them..WE in America call them Drugstore or makeup counters.. lol thanks Lisa and for the chance to say, everyone that uses make on a daily routine, needs this.. I make sure since I am oily only in the T-zone to stay clear of my scalp area in winter, it will dry it out.. but don't mind since I produce so much oil over night. It's amazing in the am just to rub in on my face to cleanes the overnight moisturizer and have skin ready to clean with a gentle cleaner.. thanks Bioderma."
3,Bioderma Crealine H2O Micelle Solution 500ml,"It really does the job taking of makeup, amazingly well. I've used it on everything from long wearing foundation to mascara to gel liner and paint pots and it makes pretty darn short work of them all. It may need a lil work on water proof mascara. The only negative is that where the consistency is almost exactly like water, you do need to be careful not to totally soak your cotton pad when you're taking your eye makeup off, or when you press it onto your eye, you'll get the product in your eye- it may hurt a bit if it goes in your eye. While it isn't in the cheapest range, you will get your money's worth. A little goes a long way and it's actually an amazing product. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all."
4,"""The Sweet"" what more can I say","The 70's gave birth the the ""Bubble Gum Pop"" era, and The Sweet led the race. And The Song that started them on the road to the top was ""Co Co"". Their Biggest Hits was their first Album to rocket them to fame. Such haunting numbers like ""Spotlight""to catchy numbers like :Poppa Joe"" , ""Little Willy"" and ""Chop Chop"" ensured the band's success as the kings of ""Bubble Gum Pop"".This album is great, along with their album""Funny How Sweet Cp Co Can Be "" cemented them as Pop Idols. As they progressed into Rock with their later albums , in which they finally started writing All their own material, they never forgot their beginnings , and their concerts always included this early work..The Sweet's Biggest Hits was their best early album & Sweet Fanny Adams was their best Rock Album. Every Collection should have both..."
5,AK Novia Pump,These shoes have a high heel yet are very comfortable. I have not problem wearing them wherever I go. I am a stay at home mom with 2 kids to chase after (Under 4) and I wear them all the time.
2,just be aware that the onscreen tab is unreadable for ntsc,"these dvd's are what they say they are except the on screen tab is completely unreadable. forget what the description says, if you purchase the ntsc version you will not be able to read the tab (i cannot speak for the pal version), however the standard notation is legible albeit difficult. so unless you want to try and mimic whats being played by ear and looking at his hands or you can sight read, dont buy or buy the book as well (expensive). apparently all the exercises on the dvd are transcribed in the flamenco guitar method books. so you really need to buy the dvd and book together if you want to utilise the material in an enjoyable and hassle free manner. personally i think it a tad unscrupulous to provide no warning of this or a booklet containing the exercises in tab format to accompany the dvd. it's a shame because i would have given five stars otherwise for everything else is great."
5,A bonsai necessity,"Simon and Schuster's book of Bonsai is a classic to use for a bonsai enthusiast. It gives details on conditions, soils, plants and care for numerous plants used for bonsai. They have information that is not available in many other bonsai texts. I have read dozens of bonsai books and have over 15 of my own including this book. I would highly recommend it for all but the novice."
5,Something new each time!,"WOW!I've read this book five times and each time I got something newout of it. It's vivid in it's imagery and the story just springs to life in your mind. My favorite character was the Angel Enos ""I want a laser axe."" It has something for everyone action, romance, monsters, battles between the forces of goodness and evil, it's a truly ""Must Read"" and read again! enjoy."
4,Boyfriend loved it,My boyfriend is a StarWars fan so for Christmas I got this for him and for once indulged this geeky side of him. He loved the shirt. Just know that it is made in true 80s fashion with the thick screen print that will start to crack with wear. I broke up with him later so I'm not sure how the shirt is fairing today. But when I saw it the colors were great and it seemed to fit true to size maybe a little on the smaller side.
5,"Well worth the money, a Playstation classic in my book!","I had this game some 10 years ago and have kicked myself for selling it with my PS1 ever since. I was so happy to find a good used copy online, and CHEAP! I have been to all the used game shops around, and most of them online, and only found way over priced copy. Don't get me wrong, YDKJ is worth it, but not being a hard core gamer I don't pay $45 for any game (hence why I still only have a PS2). This game is not heavy on the graphics and looks great, even by today's standards. Buy it, play it, than call over a bunch of friends and play it all night long (drinking along to the game is optional but highly recommended) and when you get a few minutes, remember to thank me! No matter what, remember, YOU DON'T KNOW JACK!"
4,"Pretty Cool, Pretty Funny","We have had a lot of fun playing this game that Santa left for us. It is a great way to show off your smarts and whup your friends' butts. If you like trivia games with an edge, give this one a shot. It has lots of cool puns and commercials. Not a game for the young ones."
3,Good except must be maintained,"I have always liked the look and feel of these timerland boots. The only big drawback that I can see is that you have to treat them with silacone spray each year or they will leak like a sive. If you are standing in wanter frequently then these are not the boots for you. Boot styles where the lower half is plastic or rubber are better suited for that, as long as the water level is not higher than the plastic seem of course."
3,"perfect boots,annoying transportation","when i opend the package ,There are a lot of scratches on shoes.Even ant fray on the shoelace.It brings me a bad mood"
5,Nice boots,They look great on the hubby. I wish I could get the smooth black leather boots also. I would definitely recommend
5,Good choice!,"The boots are great...quality, comfort, fit, durability and style. Tried on a friend's boots to make sure of size before ordering,(really important with shoes), but ordered on line for lower price and free shipping."
4,Great boot,"I love this boot, just wish it had a steel toe. They are extremely comfortable and look great. Exactly what I had hoped for!"
2,ok,Did not like the fit of this boot. Color was not what i had expected. Boot was so heavy and clunky.
5,Trouble getting right size,"These boots were exactly what my 17-year-old son wanted, but when we ordered his regular shoe size, they were way too big. He needed them for a trip, so we didn't have time to exchange them by mail. He tried on two other pairs at a local sporting goods store, and ended up with a full size smaller than his regular shoe size. I wish that the website had provided advice on sizing."
4,Excellent,Fast shipping boots look great got a half size too small and they fit perfectly! Great buy! I recommend that you get a half of size smaller than your original size
5,Brother loves them.,"These were a birthday gift for a man who knows what he likes and what he doesn't. He'd had a pair of these forever, but they finally had worn out. The replacement pair, he said, were perfect--right fit, good leather, comfortable to wear immediately. What more could anyone want? Thanks for continuing the style and maintaining the quality."
2,not as described,"According to the description the boots should have leather lining, but it is partially true. The toe part is not leather lined and has some sort of synthetic lining that I hate."
4,Survival of the Fittest,I purchased these boots so that I could survive the snow appocalyse of 2010. I especially liked that the boots were water proof so when I walked through the two feet of snow to get to work my doggies were bone dry. My only negative comment is the price. No one should pay over a 100 bucks for a pair of winter boots.
1,"Horrible Experience, Used Damaged boots sent","I opened this package and these boots were damaged, the toes of both boots had black scuff marks & one had a deep cut in it, boots looked like were used and returned. Wasn't enough time to reorder, ship & receive a new one b4 Christmas. Had to search several stores within 65 miles to find another size 11 boot. Then, all sales had ended and had to pay full price for it. This was a horrible experience. I do not recommend this company to anyone and I will not be buying from this site again."
5,less than in the store,My hubby wanted this for christmas but they were 180 in all the stores.... I consider this a steal. Wonderful boots.
4,nice shoes,"nice boot, and good quality. But I am facing one problem, grease stained on my right boot, can the customer service tell me which way can wash it out?"
2,Timberland Boots!!!,"I ordered this boots because they where the new version of timberland with waterprooof leather and a better confort insole, and they started to lose color!!! from the wheat color to a light brown. the outsole it appears to be incorrectly finish."
4,LONG lasting boots!,"I had a previous pair of these boots for 10 years, TEN! they scuff up and get dirty kinda quick, but can be cleaned. Timerland makes a very high quality shoe and comfortable as well!"
5,Love these boots. Look great.,Really like these boots. Probably the best boots I've ever had. Owned for about 1 year. Easy to slip on and off when going in and out of the house.
4,One Problem,I got one shoelace. That was my only problem. I was too lazy to ask for another so I just walk around with two boots and one shoelace. You get used to it.
3,good looks,"great looks, great quality. only problem is when I weare it your upper part of the boot is painfuly ageinstmy lower leg. ""may be it's just me???'. needless to say I'm only 150lb."
1,Amazon ruined my xmas,"The style I selected was a charcoal colored nubuck shoe with white soles and white stitching, however, what I received was an all black smooth leather shoe. I specifically ordered these shoes for a trip and I have no way to even be available for a return pickup...I don't drive...I don't even have a doorbell for UPS to ring when they come to pick up the return. Amazon completely failed me on this order.BUYER BEWARE, AMAZON will bait and switch and you can't call anyone to fix it.Last time I order ANYTHING from amazon.com"
5,Great shoes,"Great shoes,easy to match my levis jeans. I was a little disappointed at the begining because it hurt my side of feet sometimes.But when your feet get along with this shoes ,the pain may disappear.Now I have great walking experience everyday and it keep my feet warm ."
5,Reviewer,The product matches the description and I am very happy with my purchase. The comments about ordering the product in a half size smaller were absolutely correct. If you are a size 10 order a size 9.5 and it should fit well. So far the boots have held up well and I am planning on purchasing another pair.
5,Timberland Boots,These boot are great i bought a pair over the summer from there retail store and they are very durable and long lasting. The only thing that i would sagest would be to make sure that you know what size your foot is when wearing boots. I usually wear a size 14 but those are way to big for me so all my boot are a size 13 and fit just fine. I would sagest going down one size when you are looking at buying bots!
5,Fabulous and fashionable!,I bought these boots over a year ago for my son and he loves them. They've held up quite well and still look great....even after his brother came home for 3 weeks from college and wore them non-stop.
5,Boots,Great but. Shipped quick. Nice boots. Great price. Regular 180 at timberland store 110 on this site. Love the boots.
2,Little New or Startling Here,"Gotta say that my high hopes for this book sank further and further with every chapter I read. Rather than present the ""Adventures in the Other England"" that the subtitle promises, Cohn instead gives the reader transcriptions of conversation after conversation. Yes, he does have a knack for finding interesting people to talk to, but once he's done that, he seems content to record what they say and leave it at that. One thing he does try to stress is what a melting pot England has become since WWII and what a diverse array of lifestyles it now hosts. But unless you're completely unaware and still think Britain is nothing more than a country of cozy tea rooms and ye olde tradition, none of this is news. A far more enlightening (and depressing) book on the state of modern Britain is Nick Danziger's travelogue ""Danziger's Britain."""
3,Fun but unreliable view of England,"I'm not sure how successful Cohn is at describing the 'real' England. The motley cast of characters he 'happens' upon are just as unrepresentative of England as Dick Van Dyke's chimney sweep. But I guess a series of interviews with the real population of England - like anywhere else in the west: a collection of fairly nice but dull suburbanites - would not have made for a gripping read. And this is a gripping read - one of those books I couldn't put down.But I am suspicious of the provenance of much of the text. I get the feeling that much of what people say in the book seem to be things Cohn would have liked them to say rather than the actual verbatium 'truth'. Fair enough I supose.(By way of example, I come from Derry and I know for a fact no one but an imaginative journalist like Cohn could describe it in romantic terms!!)"
1,WORM'S EYE VIEW OF THE BRITISH ISLES,"In a dynamic Europe, the British Isles have as much significance as boring Spain and Portugal. Nik -o gives us a bookful of boring portraits of boring people. You can get this sort of stuff for nothing in the Rupert Murdoch press. Forget this one."
2,You have to read between the lines.,"Not only have I read this book - I'm in it! In fact, the whole book's about me (read between the lines). I'm on the last four pages of the next to last chapter. It's obvious (to me) that the rest of the book exists merely as a contrast and backdrop to... er... well... ME! Some parts of it are wrong. I don't have a pentagram on my wall, I don't look like Yogi Bear... etc. But I suppose Nik Cohn couldn't be seen to be in any way supporting me. It would hardly boost his reputation! If he'd better suggested what the book was really about - I'd have given it five stars."
3,"Beautiful, but . . . silverware scratches them easily.","These Pfaltzgraff dishes are beautiful, and we have used them for many years. My only complaint is that the surfaces of the dishes scratch easily by silverware. I have read that the scratches can be removed with a ceramic stovetop cleaner and elbow grease, but I haven't tried. I don't have that kind of arm strength any longer."
5,Winterberry dinnerware,"Soft colors, delicate style, good size mugs, wonderful side pieces such as the Teapot, sugar & creamer, butter dish and salt and pepper shakers. My grandchildren like the fact that their ""Grandma Holly"" uses these Winterberry..aka Holly Berry dishes for everyday meals."
5,Wonderful for holiday,"Would recommend for holiday season, use gently have noticed after 2years of use for only 3 dinners each year you can see scrapes or silverware marks on the dishes, not for every day use."
4,An execellent buy!,"This camera resembles a camcorder and that facilitates one hand operation especially when taking a high-power zoom.I like the idea of a rechargeable battery pack as compared to using AA batteries.The picture quality is excellent! In all I got 58 pictures in the best mode before the batteries began to run out. But if you've got a big hand, then gripping it and handling theh zoom switch could be a little difficult as your fingers might go well beyond the zoom lever!"
4,Yashica 2100DG Samurai Digital Camera,"This camera is a nice high resolution camera but the focus leaves a lot to be desired compared to a Sony Mavica 83. I have had poor results so far with the macro feature as well. One other thing, is the lens cap does not show when youre using the optical viewfinder, allowing you to take shots of the ""dark"". With all those things considered, its still the best bang for the buck anywhere."
3,Not bad,I enjoyed this book dot genome wrong. Maybe I'm just not a fantasy guy but this story seemed a bit stiff to me. Characters were good but not 100% believable to me. But I did enjoy reading and would probably read the sequel.
3,Story is similar to Dany The Dog .(jet lii),"the starting is very good and had a making of great story, but the way it progressed was disappointing . any way overall its a nice story."
3,Weapon of Flesh,The book was okay worth the .99 cents I spent but would not have bought the book at BAM or Borders
5,Great read!,"I really enjoyed this book. Fascinating idea for a plot and the author did a great job of bringing it to life. My only disappointment is there is no sequel. Hopefully, with the recent rise in exposure for the book that might change."
4,A fox in the chicken coop,The minute this child was set free in the world his adversaries never knew what hit them. This was a well crafted narrative with the twists and turns of life woven into the characters as they tried to come to terms that life is not always fair. A terrific read for everyone and I can't wait for next installment.
3,A decent fantasy novel.,A baby is kidnapped and turned into a human weapon thru magic tatoo's and isolation from the outside world. When he is suddenly released do to the accidental death of his sorcerous mentor he knows and understands little of the outside world. This book bogs down here and there but in all makes for a good read.
3,"good music, but not enough variety in sound.","Love the old songs. The music is excellent, but seems repetitive when heard all at once. The most ideal way to hear this album would be to alternate it with others to vary the numbers."
4,Smokey Joe's,"Love hearing these songs, most in a different style from the hits. The artists are very good. Two criticisms: First, a few have very abrupt cuts at the end, as if part of the song is dropped. Second, the title song is not on the album even through the insert says that it is on disc 2."
4,reflective flood bulbs r40 120watt,"Feit Electric 120BR/FL/MP-130 120-Watt BR40 Indoor Flood Reflector Bulb, 6-PackRec. from ups with 2 bulbs broken , but was given generous credit back for damaged mdse. Happy with product and price. Hard to find this size bulb today at retail stores."
4,enjoyable book,"This is a good book as it opened my eyes to some of the mistakes I have been making, but more useful is Strunk and White's Elements of Style."
4,"Okay, but not the Best","This book has a good idea, but the examples are only fair. It would work better if the examples came from any of the major media outlet instead of what the author does use. Still, not a bad book for the price."
3,"Fun, but disappointing","I am really disappointed (or appalled) by the fact that this guy does not appear to have any understanding of the cause of the problem he used as the title of his book! When kids would say ""Jim and me went to the mall,"" around the 70s when it became popular to have children attend school without actually teaching them anything, teachers started correcting them, ""'Jim and I', not 'Jim and me'!"" without teaching them anything about why ""Jim and me"" was wrong. They had no choice but to ""learn"" that it is wrong to say ""Jim and me,"" and that ""Jim and I"" must always be used instead. No one taught them that it is just as wrong to use ""Jim and I"" after a preposition, as it is to use ""Jim and me"" as the subject. There isn't the slightest question as to why people go around saying ""between you and I"" today, but the author of this book writes that he doesn't really know quite how this has happened. Incredible."
4,"Do not say ""decimated!!!""","Cochrane has collected examples of improper English, including grammatical errors, pronunciation, and words easily confused with each other, and attempts to educate the reader as to the correct usage. Cochrane is British, and as such, all of his examples originated in that country's publications. I assume that they remain applicable to American English, but I am not sure.The book is not pleasant to read straight through, as I soon found out, but taken in short segments, such as on break at work, it is more palatable.Some of these common errors were well known to me, but I was horrified to learn how many I'd been going about using improperly for some time. However, I'm not sure this was entirely positive, as I am now more of a grammar nazi than I already was!"
4,Beautiful and bright!,"Great aesthetic looking light for an end table or night side. Depending on what wattage of bulb you get it can get pretty bright. I took off one star because the little halogen bulbs are kind of expensive. As a pro and a con they also put off a little heat. Right now in the winter time it is great, but come summer I don't think I will like that some much."
3,Effing Awesome Bumpersticker! And So GREEN!!!!!,"This is a pretty good bumpersticker. I'd actually love to have a bumpersticker that says, ""I love my 'I love my alpaca' bumper sticker""."
5,They are Back!!,To all EWF fans and connoisseurs of good music with meaningful lyrical content...run to the music store and get this one! Every song takes you on a musical journey with rhythms that soothe the mind and take you back to the day when talent and good music was just the norm.
5,Should have been called Gurantee,"Soothing, Beautiful, Melodic, Jazzy, a little Funky, Original, Consistant, Vintage yet New, Warm, Sexy, just Right. Loved it, Bought it, Sang to it, Danced to it, and ... If you are a true fan you will appreciate this one. Thank you EWF for giving more of what you have given in the past. Job well done."
5,ewf brings us back,"this is the best new work from earth, wind, and fire since 1981's faces. Many songs stand out as classic ewf and also classic soul. Make sure you check out ""let me love you"", maurice shows why he still is a major force in soul, r&b, and popular music."
3,First half: 3 stars; second half: 4 stars,"With 17 tracks, this CD is like getting two albums in one. Are you a fan of EWF Ballads? The first half of this CD sounds like it was phoned-in. It's filled with average, largely forgettable ballads, playing no doubt to a sizable 90's EWF fan base who know the band for the power ballads. Are you a fan of classic EWF funk stew? Those of us who bought every EWF LP the day it came out as kids crave the kind of music that kicks in with track 9, that's when this CD finally gets interesting and finds its groove. With tracks like All About Love, Suppose you Love Me, and especially Never and She Waits you'll hear EWF return to some of the tasty vibes of their heyday. Some good stuff. Compare this CD to most of the current R&B on shelves, and it's 5 stars solid. Compare it to EWF's classic catalog, and it's just OK."
2,Average at Best:To Smooth for my taste,"thank goodness for ""Dirty"" at the end because I was napping through most of this Set.Earth,wind&Fire are my All-Time Favorite Band but it's been 20 Years since they last truly knocked me out with a Album of Original material&that trend continues here.alot of this Set seems to focused on the Smooth jazz element&many of the songs suffer because of that to me.""Where do we go from here""? Sounds like Old EWF I grew up on&the Kalimba Instrument is heard throughout this Set but Catchy Songs&Grooves that make your Head Bop are strongly missed here to me.glad to hear the Emotions on here."
3,Love's Patience,"In the best of times for EWF, this LP (My Old School Acting up Again), excuse me, CD, would be concidered average for the die hard EWF fan. The music is,....well,.... just OK, but it lacks the energy of prior EWF music from the 70's, 80's, or early 90's.Song Titles: Wiggle.... Betcha.... Why.... DIRTY? Where is the substance of recordings gone by? Is that the reason no lyrics are in the jacket?Vocals: They sound a little elderly.Instumentals/Music: It won't make you want to ""Wiggle"" and it ain't ""Dirty"" or clean enough to bend the ear of baby boomers or generation XI hope the future for EWF has more ""Promise""!Well EWF fans, ""Where do we go from here"" (Track 12)? I don't know but I'll still love'em anyway, thats ""Loves Patience""."
2,What happened to the FUNK guys?,"I must admit I'm a little confused at the reviewers here saying ""a return to form"". I guess you are not talking about a return to ""Earth Wind and Fire"" form, because this new CD ""The Promise"" is not the EWF I know.This CD is for the most part has (for the most part) bland-generic songwriting, way too many ballads, no energy, and the production is very COLD and computerized. I can honestly say there are two songs that even sound like classic Earth Wind and Fire. Those are ""All in the Way"", and ""Dirty"" which is an old EWF song. That is why I give this CD 2 stars instead of 1.It saddens me to see one of my favorite bands of all time playing music like this. I know they have the talent to be more creative, because they are still GREAT live. Why they can't use this energy on CD, I have no idea. This CD has NO live energy whatsoever. Its a pure product of the ""pro-tools""/digital production age.Do yourself a favor and buy ""ALIVE IN '75"", this is the real Earth Wind and Fire."
1,Geriatric Funk?,"Yes, I am one of the last truly funky white boys left on this lonely planet, so I am compelled to write this dissapointing review.E-W-F really show their age on this album. These songs make their previous album look like a fast and furious blast of funk from their past. I give it one star because there is one excellent song on the disk. ""Dirty"", (1976?) is by far the only song on this CD that makes you realize it really is E-W-F!I can't understand the logic by what others are saying. I think too many people just WANT E-W-F to sound good. Don't worry, there's always ""Gratitude"" to listen too and remember when funk music was truly FUNK MUSIC."
1,Shouldn't have been released,"I have been an E,W&F fans since the 70's and was very saddened by their newest released. Maurice White's voice doesn't sound the same after his illness. Philip Bailey's voice still sounds smooth but, the songs weren't. It's sad to say but, the group should never go to the studio again. Their time had passed!"
3,Welcome Back EWF,"If you are a true EWF fan, you'll love the fact that they are simply back on the scene and Maurice is well enough to sing again. However, the overall content of the CD was somewhatdisapointing for me. I don't mind equal amounts of ballads, but when they are in the majority, I feel somewhat cheated; especially when the most promising of EWF's upbeat tunes were presented in the form of interludes. The CD did start out with great promise, and as I listened to the first tune I was convinced that EWF had come back in a big way. But then I had to ""suffer"" through 7 love songs before the groove was back on cut #9. Still, as a EWF fan I'm just glad to see that they have not lost their distinctive sound and that they were bold enough to leave the rapping to the rappers and just do what they do best--I just hope they keep on doing it."
4,EWF Is Back!!!,"This new project by Earth, Wind & Fire is no doubt one of their best albums since 1993's ""Millenium"". What Maurice White has done is give EWF fans a fresh sound with a smooth Jazz foundation while still keeping that signature EWF sound with the best Horn Section of all time.All the tracks are excellent, but the stand out tracks are "" Hold Me"", ""Never"", ""Let Me Love You"" and ""Wonderland"" featuring Angie Stone.But unfortunatley with the popularity of this bling-bling ghetto fabulous hip hop and the prefabricated pop we hear, EWF probably won't win any new fans even though this album is excellent.If you are die-hard EWF fan or just appreciate good music in today's music's fake, microwave world, then ""The Promise"" is for you."
5,Every song is the best,"This is one of the best cds I have probably ever picked up. Every song on this cd sounds so nice, I just can't get them out of my head. This is a great cd, and a great band!"
5,Collective Souls Best CD yet.,"This CD is most certainly the best out of all of their albums,even Dosage.If you didn't like it,then your probably crazy.It most certainly deserves 5 stars.If you enjoy this CD,I would also recommend Bush,and Creed."
3,A fair album,"I bought this CD around 1995 and listened to it alot. I eventually stooped listening to it after a few months. Today I listened to it again and it's pretty good. It's not the greatest but it is good with a few good songs and a few average songs,it's an average album."
5,Still My Favorite...,After over six years this is still one of my favorite albums period and certainly the best effort by the band to date.
5,Rockin.............!,"Ever since I heard their smash hit Shine, I just could'nt get enough of Collective Soul. Ed Roland is a genius, when it comes to laying down riffs. The first song on the album (Simple), could'nt explain it better. It's a head-banger! The catchy tune Gel just haunted me for days. CS's lead guitarist Ross Childress comes up with solos that has kind of a neo-classical vibe to it at times. And at time wail licks that scorches. The World I Know and December are the softer tracks of this albums which got to be hits. Again excellent riffs. This is a must buy album for anyone that rocks!"
5,"About that ""official editorial"" review at the top....","I'm sorry, but Jim DeRogatis, the writer of that earth-shatteringly intelligent critique of this CD at the top of the screen has his head shoved so far up his rear that we will now need all the world's finest proctologist's to find it again. I can't believe they would use this kind of obviously biased and uninformed drivel as the ""official"" Amazon.com position on any album here. Yikes. Funny, neither intelligence nor good taste are required to be a music critic."
5,Another great one,"This album didn't do much for me at first listen, but after being stuck in the car on a trip with others that didn't like this brand of music I put in the ear-buds and started listening. I after the second or third listen I couldn't get enough. This album helped me get officially hooked on this band."
5,Collective Soul is Great!,Jim Derogatis is an IDIOT. Has he even listened to Collective Soul. They are great!!!! Maybe someone should rate his reviews.
5,This is truly an excellent book,This book has been my first step to a component car creation. It has outlined all the skills required and assists the builder by suggesting further reading. I have not as yet made any further in roads into the production of my Locost but intend to in the near future. I must admit living in the UK helps as parts are available here and there are enterprising individuals building parts to meet Ron's specification.
5,This is an upgrade from 1.0 to 1.5 keep that in mind,"Should you upgrade from premiere Pro 1.0 to 1.5 that can be a tough call, it is $99. One thing to keep in mind, they will be releasing an HD patch for premiere 1.5 for free so if you have version 1 .5. You will get that.The new upgrade of the project manager is a really great addition. It enables you to collect all your files together in one folder files that were used in a project. It also trims down video that you have used to just the video that's in your project so it can really help in archiving projects that you have made.Here adodes site on the changes/www.adobe.com/products/premiere/newfeatures.htmlThey really help you get started with premiere Pro.Have some fun and get it done"
2,Over-priced at $3.40,"I am not against formula romance but really, give me something of a story. Help it unfold. How many paragraphs can be spent with the characters reliving/rehashing their ""unintentional"" hot sexual encounter. And whose baby sleeps through the night without ever waking up? And what new mother just hands her baby over to a college friend whom she hasn't seen for a long time. And what college friend is so free, kind, and independently wealthy that she has time to just hang out and watch this friend's baby. And why, when she writes a popular syndicated column does it matter if she doesn't go into the office. And why bring up that she and her boss have a lot of tension when it has nothing to do with the story. Please."
3,Ok,Kept you guessing until the end. I didn't know enough about Sam's ex to think she was the killer but it ended ok.
1,best kept lies and randi are the same book,The McCafferty's is a seconed Reprint. Because I have the set.
4,My Favorite Feinstein CD,"I love, love, love this CD so much that I'm buying again! I lost my first one and have really missed it. My favorite songs are ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" and ""Wasn't There A Moment."" He does a beautiful job of vocals on this CD."
1,This is the worst cd I have ever heard,"I never thought that Michael could put out such a bad cd as this one. Let me try to explain!First off, he used a lot of arrangements with electronic instrumentation. I alwyas felt that Michael was conservative and would stick to acoustic instrumentation. Boy was I wrong!Secondly, I thought Michael did a poor job with his repertoire. The only bright spot for this cd is the fact that his voice sounded great. I hope Michael never tries to do another project with this kind of flavor.Recommendation: I can not honestly recommend this cd to anybody."
3,Nice for the price,"These earrings appear to be very sturdy. I think they are nice for the price, but not as classy as some of the other silver items I have purchased. I am keeping them to give as small Christmas presents."
5,"The very best carpet cleaner available, works every time","This is the large size of the Folex carpet cleaner. I love Folex because it works every time and takes care of the worst spots. Just used it this morning on pink smoothie that landed on very light carpet. Can't tell now it was ever there! I hope they never discontinue this cleaner. If you have a really, really tough stain, try cleaning it with Folex, then wait for it to dry and try again the next day and again the next day after that if needed. On some really bad stains, that's what you have to do in order to get it out. But 99% of the time, it works on the first try. I would never buy any other carpet cleaner again. Hope they never discontinue it!"
3,"Not as good since they ""improved"" it.","I'd been using this produce for quite some time for my terminally itchy scalp, and really liked it. When it came out ""new and improved,"" I kind of shrugged and thought ""cool,"" but the new product is thicker and harder to get out of the container, and doesn't work as well for me. I find I have to leave it upside down all the time to get any out at all, and even then it is touch and go. The new product needs to be in a tube instead of a bottle, I think.Also, the new formula seems to leave my hair very dull. I have very fine, straight hair, with thinning issues due to hypothyroid. Last thing I need is more weighing it down!I have switched to the Jason tea tree conditioner. So far so good."
1,spend the extra money for paul mitchell,"fair price but no tingle. the paul mitchell tea tree is worth the extra money and is a far better product. if i had it to over again, i'd pass on this item."
2,"Dulling, can't rinse clean","I usually use the L'Oreal EverPure line of sulfate-free shampoos/conditioners, but when this was on sale one day at the grocery store I decided to give it a shot. Not worth it! My hair is straight and below the shoulders and rarely oily or greasy, except when I use this conditioner! No matter how much I rinse, it seems to leave a dull waxy film on my hair that weighs it down all day. This might be good for someone with extremely curly/dry hair, but if you have normal or oily hair, steer clear unless you like to take two showers a day."
2,uh... not organic,I bought this conditioner because I thought it would be organic. It's not. It's pretty chemically and it doesn't do very well on my fine hair.
1,Don't buy this item!,"One star only because I can't place this review with NO stars!I ordered this combo recently and the black cartridge is NOT correct for an Epson 670 printer. It's too large for the slot. The color cartridge worked fine. When I reported the issue to Customer Service, their only solution was for me to return everything rather than sending me the correct cartridge."
5,Great gift for Bears fans,"This is a very nice quality snowglobe, nothing cheap looking about it. Sound quality is nice, too. It makes a nice edition to our Bear's memorabilia."
5,Great Book,"This book has recipes and complete instructions on how to make candies that I have been wanting to make for years. Some recipes have been tried with great success and I can't wait to try more. I ordered one book for me and another one for my daughter after I saw this book at my daughter-in-law's. This is an older book, but well worth having."
2,Great Idea Very Bad Quality,"My daughter loves it, but after only a few uses it leaked, located that leak and it lasted only a week, until the next leak. I am very disapointed, it should have lasted longer than a couple of months."
5,Great for Barbie enthusiasts!!!!,I bought this inflatable bed for my 3 year old and she LOVES it. It is very easy to inflate and it's perfect for sleeping over at grandma and grandpa's house. It is very comfortable and includes a soft blanket that she zips up into and an attached pillow as well. It's a must have when we travel and folds up into a pretty pink carrying bag all set to go!! I would recommend this product highly.
5,Kids love it... until it springs a leak,"My 2 and 4 year olds love their Barbie beds! It's fun for them to help inflate it - good for teachin cause & effect (pump it & it will blow up). The only downside is that the beds spring leaks quite easily. Sure it can be patched, but after the third time, I'm not sure that it's worth the price."
3,Woody Lee CD,"Woody Lee has a great voice and some talent. For the years he sang it's a little surprising he didn't get further and that his songs didn't get more airtime. He seemed to fit right in with what was ''country"" then. Overall, the CD is good, probably wouldn't be your favorite but you would play it for background at your next BBQ."
4,Zuke's and cat's stiff joints,I started using these for my older cat a couple of years ago and believe they do help. Both my cats seem to like them too. We use the chicken flavor
2,Overrated!,"I briefly read parts of the book as a second year medical student after hearing its rave raviews and was quite diasappointed. Its programmed learning style isn't for everybody. I felt like I didn't retain anything nor did I understand what was going on at a fundamental level. For me, it was important to understand the physiology of the EKG before moving on to using the EKG to diagnose pathophysiological problems. In this respect, Dubin book's is lacking."
5,Excellent first source to learn ECG's,I found this book to be the best initial book to learn and really understand ECG's.
2,Mormon Romance,If you are not familiar with the Mormon experience and why they chose to move West in the mid-1800's this book could be confusing and frustrating. As a romance it is too predictable for me. This was obviously written for an L.D.S. audience.
1,"My enemy, my stupid",This book is an atrocity! The plot line is hackneyed. The characters unorigional. The author should reassess her career options. perhaps she should just be a stay at home mother.
4,nice for the price,"If your not looking to spend $500-$1000 on something like klipch, JBL, or Yamaha speakes, this is a great set for the price. i have had mine for two years and they are still kicking. very powerful bass. i would recommend these for anyone who wants to spend less on a set of speakers that are in my opinion the same or better than some top line stuff. i use them for movies and music and work out great."
5,children of god' fire,"this is a highly technical book with excellent historical references and obvious good research. Very educational and informative. It is very readable. A word of caution: some of the commentaries reflect US or English mindset bias, i.e. a hint of a moral superiority, unwarranted, most probably unintentional and unconsciously done, but frequently encountered in books written in the English language about other cultures, which may offend other native language speakers."
3,She loves it - I was disappointed,"I typically purchase my daughter's books based on quality, not character recognition. However, I made an exception for this book. My 20 month old daughter really likes this book. She loves to look at other babies, and loves Barnie. I didn't find it very good though. Half the book is Barney, half baby pictures. Baby Einstein has much better books with baby pictures that I think are better pictures, are more engaging and I find with this book there is really nothing for us to talk about since she is so distracted by Barney."
1,Not much to see!,"This book illustrations have a certain spartan appeal,like charles atlas ads in back of comic books.The lackluster design of about 80% of this artwork is really sad although it does add another piece to bway history for which the normally fabulous Chronicle books should be commended.The captions are also uninspired and sparse ,there is just no joy in this presentation,a missed chance to do something really worth having.I would buy it but will wait til it is remaindered,sorry!"
5,Vintage Stuff,"I bought this CD in 1995 and must say from the thousands of CDs I bought over the years, this the best ever. No amount of dollars will convince me to sell this gem. Land of Love, Where Ever You Go...Classic stuff. Was fortunate to get at least one performance on DVD recently.Kenneth from South Africa....."
4,Nice looking bike,"I bought this thinking it would look great on my desk since I own a Roadking, but I ended up having to split the wheels apart to get more white blocks so the dull white wouldnt be on the outside. It is a nice looking bike when finished and gives a feeling of satisfaction when the last of the decals goes on and you step back to admire your work."
4,LEGO LOVER,"OK, SO THESE ARE NOT LEGOS. MOST OF THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH. HOWEVER THE GRAPHICS ARE TO SMALL AND SOMETIMES IT GET CONFUSING AS TO WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO ATTACH SOME OF THE PIECES. ALSO THEY PIECES DON'T STAY TOGETHER AS WELL AS LEGOS AND THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO STICK TOGETHER AT TIMES."
1,Heating element turns off before water comes to a boil,This would have been a good product if the water actually boiled before turning itself off. I intended on using this kettle to boil water to make tea. I like the water to be boiling hot to do that but this kettle will not come to a boil. Am guessing that the thermostat or the mechanism used to determine when the water is boiling is not working correctly.
3,"Fast, nice looking...but limited life","We're buying our third Toastess kettle in about six years. The two previous kettles died about 2-3 years after we started using them.The kettle boils water a lot faster than on the stove. It's possible to boil a very small amount, and the auto-off ensures that you don't waste electricity. We have turned it on by accident when it's empty and the auto-off stops it from being damaged.Unlike some electric kettles, where the docking part is round, this kettle can only be docked in a single position. Generally that's not caused us a problem. The short cord can be coiled underneath the docking part so it's really neat.I just wish they'd last longer."
4,Delivers on promise,"I bought this kettle for our office, since we needed boiling water for tea and such.It does everything we need, and it's pretty.We haven't had any problems with it, and it's been used several times a day. It works like a charm."
1,Bad Choice,"The product description for this kettle says it has a concealed element. It doesn't. Water kettles without the concealed element get caked with water and mineral scale. Also, I broke a nail just trying to get the lid open - not a good idea when there is boiling temperature water inside! Don't buy this one."
4,GreatQuality,This product is great in quality and convenience. The only exception is that the ON/OFF word on the switch is in ink which can be erased easily by wet.
3,Toastess TJK-28W 1500 Watt Electric Kettle,"This kettle boils very fast, that is the best part. When you open the lid the condensation on the inside of the lid drips down the side - that is the minus part but may not bother everyone. Wouldn't be my #1 choice but not bad for the price."
3,Toastess TJK-28W Electric Kettle Jug,"The electric kettle works well & fast. When it's not filled to capacity, the self turn-off takes a little longer (i.e. the water in the kettle boils longer before the kettle turns itself off). The lid does not open very easily."
3,Kettle,"Kettle works ok, but I got what I paid for. It is not the same quality as say the T-Fal unit I have, but Toastess was cheaper. Not as easy to use as T-Fal because electrical connection is an offset rectangular block rather than a central round post, so there is only one position where kettle sits on base and makes the electrical connection. Biggest drawback is that the on/off switch only turns on, will not turn off manually, so I have to wait for kettle to boil and then turn off automatically. Not a big deal, just sometimes inconvenient.All things considered, just an ok unit."
3,The Heating Element is NOT Concealed,"Although one of the Product Features (as of today) says ""Concealed stainless-steel heating element resists corrosion and scale build-up,"" it is not true. The heating element does look like stainless steel, but the whole thing is entirely visible when you open the lid and look inside the kettle. Also, although it is cordless, the electric contact between the base and the kettle is not located in the center of a round base but on the side of the oval base. I have to pay attention to the location of the contact before I dock the kettle back to the base."
1,poor performance,"I regret i decided to save $$ and bought this kettle.Problems:- the unit feels cheap- the heating element is not concealed, as the description leads you to believe. Instead it is a big coil, and you must pour enough water to coat it every time.- after a few month of use the top opens only with some straggle- Autoshut off does not work. So many times i found red hot coil inside an empty unit, who know how much electricity this waists!My grandfather used to say ""I am not rich enough to buy cheap things"", I'll try to remember it better next time."
2,Certainly not worth the raves.,"The other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have. It pales in comparison to my old Hamilton Beach, however, in several respects. Well, really, one big one. It's a plastic object. And it gets very hot. Too hot. Hot enough that it smells like it's melting itself. I got this as a gift, rinsed it thorougly, boiled a pot just to clean it - and it stunk like melted plastic. Ran it again to try and get the smell out. Same thing. Rinsed it with cold water and tried again - still melted odor. The outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off (a problem I didn't have with my previous kettle, which I lost in a move), and when I touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger. You can bet I put this right in the mail back to Amazon. I normally would hesitate to return a gift, but I'd rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust."
3,Returned it,"Couldn't be more agreed with Tony T' review below. I purchased it last Christmas and when I open the package, the heating element was right there in front of my eyes, it is NOT CONCEALED. I thought it was just a defective one since the Amazon description clearly stated that it is ""concealed"". Amazon allowed me to return it for free. Now I realized that it was not the kettle that was defective, it was just an incorrect description. I am glad that I bought Braun kettle instead, for only $5 more it got top quality and a 360 rotatable base, much better."
1,HORRIBLE!!,This cartridge is NOT compatible with the Epson 2000p printer. Please don't waste your money! My print turned out completely wrong color-wise. I got my money back. That company should not be falsely advertising this product!
1,BEWARE ! Not an EPSON cartridge - this is a RHINOTEK,"Don't be fooled. This Rhinotek cartridge is not an EPSON cartridge; and the printer knows it. It is not 100% compatible. After installation, only 1 nozzle worked, the magenta one. We had to clean the nozzles 5 TIMES to get all colors to print correctly. We also had to change our color management settings. And the prints still smeared 48 hours after printing. Don't waste your time, buy the genuine EPSON cartridge. The aggravation is not worth the savings."
1,Tropic of Gallagher,"This was very disappointing. I am an old fan of Gallagher, but this video does not live up to his norm."
5,The best book of all time,"One of the most important books in the history of human thought, and certainly among the top five in the history of mathematics, by the most important mathematician ever. I enjoy reading Gauss' own methods. Especially interesting if you study congruences, cyclotomy, etc."
5,Classic bay area,"Khayree is known for making some heavy basslines and nice tracks. On this album it shows how good he really is. I was chillin watching videos in 95' and ''in the game'' came on. As soon as I heard the beat I was blown away, then ray luvs flow was just tears up the track. I knew from then that this whole album would be heavy because of hearing that track, it showed the quality was just shining and there was something there to get. Not long after, I picked it up and it's been a favourite since too. I love this album so much, theres so many rappers ray luv blows away. The bay area was represented right by this man in 95. If you are looking for a classic oakland style or any style classic really, you need to pick this up straight or lose out. Its my favourite ray luv album too. Straight through, start to finish classic. Later!"
4,ray luv.....strait dope,"YBB records are strait dope...i've listened 2 the mac,mac d.r.e,ray luv,and young lay 4 yrs scince i was itrodused in 92...personaly i think that YBB will always kill tha others..i've followed all of them and have all their cds...i suggest u pick them all up...also check out cloud 9 records..da'unda'dogg"
1,Worked for 1 year and then chip burnt up....,"I bought this product and hooked it up for a year with 2 computers on it. When, after just over a year, I put for computers on it for LAN gaming, the processor burnt up. Since hubs don't need to do much processing this is pretty poor quality..... Bottom line is if you are going to hook more than 2 computers up to it get a different brand."
5,awesome professional knife,"This is the third knifes I bought. I am a researcher and need to build prototypes using a range of materials (Paper, foam, boards, plastics among others). I bought one for myself and send one to the engineering team to use to replicate my product. A couple weeks ago, I sadly forgot mine at my dad's house and I don't have the heart to take it back now. The weight and strong build makes cutting a range of material effortless. Additionally the quality of the cut is much better even for precision work. I love it."
1,a bad company,"when I open this item, I found the original packaging torn and held together by tape.So,all the parts were not there thus making the system worthless...I told them of the problem,they did nothing,,I had $18 invested,and will not spend a cent more,,THEY SHOULD SEND ME A NEW SET,NO CHARGE...."
5,YAY!,great product and what a great invention to playing live yay easy to change out of the guitar love this
4,I Prefer Scahllers...,"I tried this model a few years ago, and I never had a problem with them (once I got it installed), but I went back to the Schallers I had on my other instruments. I thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument, which I thought looked goofy. I also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. I also felt safer with the Schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together. As I said, I had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great. As with all replacement strap locks/buttons, you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers, dropped out of airplane, or what have you."
4,Dunlop vs. Schaller?,"I have both Schaller and Dunlop Straploks. Many years ago, I decided to standardize, and I picked the Schallers. I don't remember why. I put Schallers on all of my guitars, I put the Dunlops on the bass. I regret that decision now. In my view the Dunlops are more dependable. You need to keep on top of the Schallers, check them all the time, because they loosen and come apart. In fact I found a piece from a Schaller on the stage floor last night. It wasn't mine, but it didn't surprise me to find it. The Dunlops have never come apart. I'm going to put Dunlops on my new bass, and eventually all of my guitars will be switched over. I don't want to drop a guitar because I forgot to check the Straplok. Using thread locker on the Schaller install is probably a good idea, it would help, but I think the fundamental design of the Dunlops is better."
3,"Screws strip too easy, but good if you can screw in","I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy. I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago, and I dont recall having this issue, so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point. I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle, and the locks are secure. However, due to this issue, I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks. I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon."
2,Too Big.,"Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big. They stand out too much. They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap. Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play. Not cool."
2,Don't care for this,I bought this based on the good write-ups about these but was disappointed when they arrived. They feel like cheap pressed metal and are very clanky. Recommend getting more substantial strap locks from another manufacturer if you need them.
2,Be prepared to break out the power tools,"The screws that come with the strap locks are not the same size as the stock screws on most guitars. To get them installed, I had to file down the head of my stock screws (I can confirm this for Spector, Ibanez, and Dean basses). I would suggest that method as opposed to other suggestions I received of ""drilling"" the hole out in my bass. Needless to say I'm still a bit ****** off about the needed adjustment that seems to stem from a design flaw."
2,Hardware is terrible,"The Straplok itself works well. The installation hardware, mainly the screws, are terrible in design. The heads of the screws strip way too easily, even if you wax the top of them. I was not able to screw them in all the way so I had to use my drill to remove it, which ended up ruining my guitar. They need to come up with a better design for installation."
4,Great Strap Locks,"These Dunlop Strap Locks are very nice looking, well built, easy to install, easy to use, and feel very secure. They are a quite large however and that is probably the only reason I did not give these a 5 rating. I will not trust my 1975 Les Paul to just any strap lock. These meet my demanding needs. I have been playing for 40 years and based on my experience, would rate these very decent."
3,"Great buy, took forever to get here","I love these strap locks, so when I found some on here for cheap I was all over them. Shipping took a little longer than expected but they made it finally. No more neck dives or straps falling off my Epi- bird now!"
5,The best straplocks available at any price,"My bass had original-equipment Dunlops on it, but they were silver-tone, whereas all my other hardware is gold. And after 30 years, they looked kind of dirty and tarnished. So, I knew it was time for a new gold set, and I couldn't be happier with their look and quality. I have used that other S-brand on other instruments, and really prefer the Dunlops."
5,"Simple, easy to install","No complaints about this hardware. Easy to install with patience, easy to use. The click on/off system securely holds your strap, and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.These work like a light switch...on/off, so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor. There aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.Quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.I've installed these on a 3/4 Hoener, Full Sized Squire Acoustic, and 2 Fender Strat's."
4,Excellent product.,I've purchased these (in different colors) for a few of my guitars. I love them. Installation is pretty simple and they really allow me to play without worrying if my guitar strap is going to come loose.
3,Bumpy Road For a Bumpy Product,"I ordered these straplocks from Ace Photo Digital Because they had the cheapest price overall posted. However my penny pinching came at a price of this particular arriving a few days late. I contacted the seller and they were more than willing to help and they refunded my shipping to make up for the delay. Now to the product, I usually go for the Schaller/Schaller-ish type straplocks. I bought these for a bass that I built because I thought the ""look would fit"", but these straplocks to me are a bit mechanical. Instalation was a bit of a hassle compared to just screw strap to lock and poof. The buttons hold tight, and the strap in no way in he** is gonna unscrew off and fall like my others did once or twice. This straplock is for someone who will use the same strap over and over again. I'm using it on a strap that i'm actually gonna replace as soon as I find one I like. then it will serve its purpose."
5,Should have purchased these a long time ago!,"5 stars across the board, exceptional functionality and work exactly as advertised. I will be picking up a pair of these for the rest of my guitars very soon."
1,"Dunlop Straploks SLS1033BK RUST! 2 weeks after installing them, they RUSTED and ruined my Levi's guitar strap! RUST?","Dunlop Straploks SLS1033BK RUST! 2 weeks after installing them, they RUSTED and ruined my Levi's guitar strap! RUST?Try contacting them for customer service...good luck!"
1,Where to start?,Lot of unnecessary parts involved. Pain in the behind to put together. It works like it's supposed to but was a real pain in the butt to put together. You have to drill a different sized screw hole to make it fit in my case. My guitar is an EVH Wolfgang Special. Wouldn't recommend it if you don't have any mechanical experience
3,Didn't fit my guitar,"I understand this is a common problem with strap locks, but the screws provided didn't fit my guitar (too small, slid out), and the existing screws in the guitar were too large. It's an easy fix (apparently) with toothpicks and glue, but I'd rather buy hardware that fits."
4,Great locks for the price!,These locks were and easy install and fit well with the screws sent. Took me about fifteen minutes to install them. They're not so big that they look outrageous on my Strat either and seem to be built pretty solidly. A good buy for the price.
4,Simple enough to install.,"I have always been weary of putting new screws into any instrument. This didn't end up being a problem for me because the supplied screws were the exact same size as the ones that were already in my Dean bass. The installation was pretty straightforward, just be careful that you don't use a screwdriver with too wide of a shaft. It would have been nice if the instructions had suggested easier tools for getting on the retaining clip.There are a couple issues I have encountered. I have found that straplocks extend out just enough to stop my guitar and bass from fitting in the case. Of course that's easily remedied by taking of the strap (which is best to do anyways before packing up), but it's just one more step that can be annoying if you're in a hurry to pack up or get started. Also, I've found that they sometimes rattle a bit when used on my acoustic bass. At some point I'll go in and add some additional padding to remedy the looseness of the fittings."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought some dunlop strap locks many years ago for one my bass's.I suppose they technically stay on.... but if you take them off have fun trying to put them back on!They also rattle with most every note I play... Its not the end of the world since my strap can stay on inside the hard-case for my bass.I would recommend Ernie Ball strap locks. They are few more bucks, but they actually work. You can take them on and off. I have Ernie Ball on all of my other instruments."
5,Perfect,These work just like you want them to. But a new strap and put these on right away. It's worth it.
4,Dont know why I put off getting this,"Straplocks have been around for a long time, but now You can use the instrument with a regular strap as well, This dual design sold me on it..Easy to install on the guitar. A little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap, still only took about ten minutes to do. The added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isn't going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item.."
4,"Strong, easy install",No worries about these popping off or wearing out.Dinged them one star because they stick out from the guitar a bit more than I would like. However they look fine.
3,"Works but had to ""ruin"" a strap for everything else.","The Dunlop strap locks work pretty well, but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons. The strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes. This for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again.They do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required."
4,Teaches tricky words through word games and puzzles,The book has almost a hundred word games and puzzles that keep repeating 600 or so words that I've seen around often but never had more than a fuzzy idea about the meaning. If you like word puzzles it's a lot of fun and a painless way to increase the vocabulary.
5,Easy Read & Lots of Specifics not found in other books,I have over 25 palmistry books and this one was a really good addition to my collection. It offers additional info that I have not found in other books. Easy to read and has clever descriptive terms to easily remember the different types of lines and features of different types of palms.
2,Uneasy Reading of Classical Jewish Texts,"I was so excited to read this book. For me, the essays, mostly, do not live up to the book's title. There is very little ""reading of classical texts."" My sense of that term means going under and behind the text for those of us who don't read Hebrew. The writers tried, I think, but their writing was very turgid, repetitive and seemed to try too hard to be scholarly or profound.Two parts of the book show the writers interacting with their own mentors in ""learning to read."" Those sections were excellent.I donated my copy to my local Temple."
5,Excellent tool for teachers,"This is an excellent product that has been very useful at the school that I work at. We use the money like real money to ""pay"" students for their work, much like real life. After kids earn their ""money,"" they are able to ""buy"" items at different prices. This product is realistic enough that it is very useful as an educational tool.As a side note, I love that the product has ""In toys we trust"" written instead of ""In God we trust."" It is appropriate for a public educational setting, and I feel it shows that manufacturers have a sense of humor ;)All in all, a great product- you may find cheaper play money, but it will not be as educationally relevant."
1,Not Happy,"I am a teacher who was going to use this product for the money unit we are currently studying, I was very excited about this product because of how realistic the money looks and that it came in a great carrying case with a lid for easy storage. To my dismay there are no pennies, (I was provided with two set of quarters instead) also there is no lid included. I called the company and have yet to hear a response."
5,Great Teaching Aid,Spending time with my 5 year old nephew and he's learning the value of money very quickly. Easy for me to teach him with the aid of the play money set. Thank you!
5,Great product,The kids loves it!! It is very life-like to practice money counting skills. I would highly recommend this product to parents of kids learning about money.
3,Where's the lid?!?!,"This is a mixed bag; the play money & wooden tray are nice. I think we'll get a lot of use out of this set as both a teaching aid & toy. HOWEVER, the product description reads, ""Conveniently packaged set has dozens of pretend bills from $1 to $100 and hundreds of play coins, all securely stored in a wooden cash drawer with sliding lid"". Well, our set does not have any kind of lid what so ever. It's just a partitioned tray. You can find play money anywhere, but I liked this set because it came in a nice tray WITH A LID. If you're looking for a play money set, this one is nice. Just be aware that you may not be getting the item as advertised which was very disappointing to us."
1,Now we're taking God off of our money?,"I think it's really lame that the coins say ""in toys we trust"" instead of ""in God we trust."" Is our belief and trust in God really so offensive that we have to remove it?"
2,Our set did not have the sliding lid,"Overall this set is nice and has a nice wood drawer. HOWEVER, ours DID NOT come with the sliding lid - which was the main reason I bought this set - because I thought I would be able to keep everything contained and not have to worry about the bills and coins falling out. I'm very disappointed that it did not come with the sliding lid. I noticed some people have received the lid - but be aware that some sets do not. In our wood drawer, there isn't even any grooves where you could slide a lid in. Considering sending it back because of this."
3,the coins are not as good as I would have expected,"I purchased a cash register for my kids, and purchased this additional money to go along with it. In my opinion, the coins in the cash registered are far superior to these. These are very chunky and lacking the element of realism, that the other coins have."
