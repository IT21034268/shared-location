1,Lesson learned,"After reading reviews of the carafe breaking, I unwisely made the choice to purchase this model anyway, because I really liked the design. BIG MISTAKE! I was very careful with it after reading the reviews, but like all the others, mine broke too. I contacted Krups to see if they would replace it, in light of the history of breakage. No go. Two words that don't go together, KRUPS & CUSTOMER SERVICE. Buyer beware! It's not ""IF"" the carafe will break, it's ""WHEN"". Also note replacement carafes cost $25 plus shipping. This carafe should be recalled. Avoid Krups!"
3,"pretty good, but beware if you need replacement parts","My wife's the coffee drinker in the house, so I bought her the Krups 467 about a year ago. We haven't had any problems with it in terms of leaking. However, my wife bumped the carafe in the sink while washing it, and it cracked pretty easily. OK, maybe not a big deal, just order a replacement carafe. The replacement has been on back-order with Krups for about 2 months now, and they still don't know when they will get more in stock. Every distributor that I can find on the web is also out of stock. While my wife enjoyed it while it was working, we're now looking at replacing it just because we can't get a common part for it."
1,Buy the Bunn,"Fill the coffee pot with ten cups of coffee and watch the water spill out the back of the machine. It should really be called the 9 1/2 cup crystal arome time coffee maker. The filter went in two months and I have yet been able to find a replacement. Even on Amazon, you have to buy ""refurbished"" filters. Who wants to buy someone else's old filter? The clock is small and almost impossible to read, unless you are three inches from the machine, which you will be as you wipe up the water spilling out of the back of the resevoir."
4,Good performer...,"In short I've had mine for about 4 years and have had little trouble with it. I do have the model with the dribbling carafe and it has been annoying, but does seem to pour better with the lid off when adding the water. The filter did make at least a slight difference when used but I've grown tired of replacing it and instead use filtered water from my refridgerator. I would also agree with other comments about the carafe seeming and being excessively fragile. I haven't broken one but the spout did chip in the dishwasher a year ago or so. I would recommend it to others especially if the dribbling carafe issue has been fixed."
2,"Love the coffee, hate the hassel's!","I love the look and the coffee is great! The poblem 4 replacements in 3 years! The element inside begins to burn out, this begins to slow down the process, it takes a good hour to brew a pot!"
2,Skin deep beauty,"My wife bought this coffeemaker to replace our Hamilton Beach Aroma Express. While it is certainly attractive, its good looks are overshadowed by 1) a very small reservoir opening 2) a 10 cup capacity 3) a clock you can't read. On the flip side, the coffee is good and hot..... but the Hamilton Beach did that, had a 12 cup capacity, easy reservoir to fill and was half the cost."
2,Great until you need a replacement carafe,"This coffee maker was wonderful, until my husband cracked the carafe. It is impossible to find replacement carafes for this coffee maker, and it cracks fairly easily. It has been 3 months since the carafe broke and we are still unsuccessful in our search for a replacement."
4,Good Machine,"We received this coffee maker as a wedding gift 8 years ago, and have used it almost everyday since. Never had a problem or a leak. We have used the timer mode alot without issue. Unfortunately my husband has to program it every time we unplug it, or have a power loss. I can't figure out how to set anything without a manual. But making basic coffe is a breeze. The warming plate keeps coffee warm and without a cooked taste for at least 1 hour. Longer than that it does taste baked. I used unbleached paper filters, and the coffee is very good. You can really taste the difference between brands and types of coffee. A good and reliable machine."
1,Junk Broke in 6 months,I spent a little more than usual on a coffee pot in hopes that it would last longer than the usual cheap coffee makers I bought... Boy was I wrong it didnt last 6 months. It just quit on a much needed sunday morning. Not to mention it always leaked and was difficult filling.
1,Buy Something Else,"I should have read the reviews here before I bought this. I've owned Krups coffee makers for 15 years and always felt they were very high quality. Sadly, that's obviously not the case anymore. I experienced most of the problems other reviewers have had with this coffee maker. A piece of the carafe broke off in my hand when I was drying it. It cost almost $30 with shipping to replace. The water filter ripped apart when trying to replace it and charcoal spilled everywhere. The last straw is the leaked coffee all over the counter when you pour a cup during brewing. I won't buy Krups again until they get their act together."
4,Nice Coffeemaker with Compact Design,"I never owned a Krups before and decided to take a chance on it. I like it. The design is compact and not bulky like many models on the market. This is a nice feature is you have a small countertop. My absolute favorite feature is the fact that there is no dripping or spilling when you pour a cup of coffee or fill the water reservoir - no matter how quickly or slowly you pour. The filter is a nice feature too, but I really couldn't tell that it affected the flavor at all. I think the brand of coffee used is still the most important factor in taste. I gave it 4 stars because I can't vouch for durability yet, and I didn't think it kept coffee hot as long as other models I've owned. This is no big deal to us. We usually consume it too quickly, and when we have any left over we pour it into a carafe. Otherwise, I think it is a nice pot."
2,"Okay, but not worth the money",I bought this product because Krups seemed like a quality name and the design was very eye-catching. I'm not impressed though. The actual coffee pot design could have been constructed better because it seems to spill if the coffee is not poured slowly.The filter light flashes after a while to change the filter. I use bottled water and when you pull the filter out it is still so clean. I'm not sure if the filter (useage) is just timed and it just starts flashing automatically.I feel you can find a better coffeemaker / brand for that amount of money. Look around and read the reviews so you can get an idea of other's experiences... Good Luck!
4,Nice coffee maker,makes great tasting coffee. NOTE: use the water filters. Filtered water makes a BIG difference.
1,Poor Quality,"We registered for this coffee maker at BB&B; for our wedding. We loved it at first until we realized:- a little over a year later the drip stop is almost worn out. We can't ""stop and pour""- it's leaking coffee from somewhere - we can't figure out where and to keep it from ruining our counter we have to sit it in a tray- the gold filter thing is very expensive to replace."
3,"Fairly good, but.....","I have mixed thoughts about this coffee maker. Yes, if you brew a pot with high-quality, freshly ground beans, the Krups Crystal Arome Time will give you great coffee.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the glass carafe is messy. I have owned mine for three years now and I have yet to pour a cup without dribbling some coffee down the side of the carafe onto the counter. (I've even had others attempt to pour to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong! ) Plus, the dial/switch on the front plate has given out. The machine now has to be unplugged to be turned off, instead of simply flipping the switch to the off position.All-and-all, we've had three years of good coffee. I'll probably get a different brand and model to replace it, and hope the next one lasts a little longer."
3,doesn't anchor well,"my kids love to swing, but this just doesn't seem safe. we have it anchored, but it still moves around quite a bit. too bad."
4,between 3 1/2 and 4 stars.,The first reviewer paints an accurate account of the book. It is well written and goes into great detail. Although the romance takes a major backseat to the war. I found myself skipping parts of the book so that I could get to the end. The characters have great depth especially edwin brady and the observations on his personality are quite accurate. Butthe book was just lacking something to make it truly good or great. Maybe it was the romance aspect. I am not sure I will have to think on that.
4,just what i needed,works good install was vary easy and that was the point of spending the money worth the time saved on cutting and soldering
2,this should be for a bike not a car,When installed the kit has no volume. It is a joke! i woould not have bought it if i knew the engine on the car would drown out most any sound .....and my nissan cube is new!
3,wolo 345 animal horn needs more volume!,"Purchased the Wolo 345 animal house for the party boat. Got it and installed it with no problem. Yes it's got the animal sounds and the sirens and music, but I give it a 3 star rate because it comes with a sales flier in it for a lager PA horn and I know why the one you get is tiny and not really loud unless you have full volume on siren. Also disappointed with the music setting on it because I can't choose the song, it's kind of a loop so unless you push the horn button and hold it your gonna get ""It's a small world"" every time till it's finished. To me it is just OK."
1,not what i expected,you cant chose the music to play.... not that loud.... overall sucks.. (just get the airhorns...) if i wasnt too lazy to return this item i would have... it sucks...
5,love it,"havent had the time for set up yet, but it looks like its gonna be very awesome! in perfect condition! thanks"
2,Not the best,I installed the system in my truck the next day I had my truck. I was really loud for about a week and then after that its not very loud the horn is bulky and the microphone was cheap and messed up really quickly. Other than that the Ice Cream noise is a good way to get people to laugh. Over all I hate this thing DON'T BUY THIS CHEAP THING!!!!!!!!
1,broke in the first week,"dont buy this thing. The switchs broke the first week I had it, only thing that worked after that was the PA its JUNK."
1,Cheap product,This horn is terrible. Everything is cheap about this product and it broke after 1 month. I would NEVER purchase it again!
4,tons of fun,"this shipped quickly, but i was disappointed when i saw how it all connects. Its kind of a pain to set up, but once it is the sounds are pretty loud. Either the microphone sucks or the speaker isn't that loud when you use the PA. The sirens are loud. Also, you cant pick a tune out of the 50 options, they just play sequentially."
2,The sound is terrible,"This is a terrible product. I thought it would be fun for the kids and I to put in our van. I own an automobile repair shop, so it was professionally installed. The speaker is right behind the front grill. When you speak through the microphone the audio quality is so terrible you cannot understand what the person is saying at any volume. The animal sounds are pretty funny, that is why I am giving it 2 stars, but they even sound bad. It is such a piece of crap, I am not sure how long it will stay installed on my van and taint its quality image."
4,"Tricky to install, but worth it.","the wires arent that long, so youll need to get some longer ones. and getting the speaker wire through the firewall is a hassle, but after you get it set up its worth it. its very loud."
3,"It's OK, but not what I wanted","50 tunes: they play in the same order again and again. There is no way to select the one you want. Each time you turn it off then back on it starts at the beginning. The fun side is you turn it on and your car sounds like the Ice Cream car. The animal sounds are decent.If I had to buy one now, this would not be the one. No Dixie!!"
3,Mediocre and wordy,"Takes forever to get nowhere: Authors use about 800 pages in order to explain Spring (trivially a framework, i.e. a conceptually trivial subject, not comparable in complexity with e.g. compiler theory).Wordy, uncreative and just as boring as watching paint drying.Lacks illustrations of concepts."
1,None of the examples are complete (or even close),"This book is full of code samples - unfortunately, none of them actually work, because they're all missing a lot of detail. For example, in chapter 8, on Spring JDBC, all of the examples use a database schema... whose details aren't presented. If you're already very familiar with JDBC, you can figure this out from the code samples; but if you're not an expert on a given topic (for example, AOP), you won't be able to make heads or tails of the examples; you won't even understand what they're trying to do (the book doesn't bother to try to clarify).All in all, I found this book extremely frustrating - it seems as if the authors understand the how, but not the why. If they do understand the why, they certainly do a good job of hiding it. Take it from me - skip this one."
2,This is not for Spring beginners,This book is not for programmer who needs more exlanationThey tried to explain everything in shot...
3,"Good Intro to Spring, Not Enough Examples","This book gives a good introduction to the Spring Framework, Aspect-Oriented Programming, and Inversion of Control on a whole. However, for a framework that many people will be using for web development, this book has only one chapter on Spring MVC; much of the implementation details are left up to the reader to discover on his/her own.If you are looking for an overview of the Spring Framework and some of its basic implementations, this book is a good start. If you are looking for a ""cookbook"" with detailed examples, you would be better off searching the forums and newsgroups online."
5,Excellent resource,"At my old position, I constantly referenced this book, but fortunately the company owned the book. When I left that job, I purchased my own copy. It's well written and provides enough examples to get you started. This book is a MUST HAVE for my library."
4,Good suggestions,"This book has a wide range of useful information. I was looking for creative ideas to make taking lunch more fun, and this book was full of them. I also liked that it didn't rely on foods some kids are allergic or intolerant to."
4,ADHD child,"I have an ADHD nephew who won't eat anything but pizza (no sauce), chicken nuggets (no strips), sugary cereal, (no milk) and any thing with sugar or icing. This book has given us ideas to correct his diet."
3,"Same old, same old","I didn't find much new here. If you've read any other lunchbox packing books and have even a little knowledge of nutrition, don't bother with this book."
2,boring,I just want the different options to pack the lunch box. In this book you read and read but where are the options?
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I BOUGHT IT, THINKING I COULD LEARN SOME CHAIR MASSAGE TECH. THERE ARE SOME TECHNICS BUT NOT ENOUGH TECH TO LAST MORE THAN 5 MINUTES. I SEEN LOT OF CHINESS GUYS WHO HAD VERY LIMITED MASSAGE TRAING ON STREET OF NEW YORK SHOWED BETTER TECHNICS THAN THIS. ONE THING THIS DVD SHOWS HOW TO MARKET CHAIR MASSAGE TO DIFFERENT GROUPS."
1,Don't waste your money,Purchasing this dvd was a waste of money and time. The techniques demonstrated were ridiculous and useless. Connie Scholl is sharp at marketing but not as a massage therapist.
4,Really informative and educational,"I believe I can make anything. Sometimes a delusion! I wanted to weld, and this DVD is very informative about all aspects of welding especially saftey, and tools. I also don't have a welder to teach me.I had planned to buy a small gas welder as reviews suggested teaching the kids to weld, was possible, with small welders.For the person who has a dedicated space, even if it is outdoors this is a good video.The downside is the presentation which seems a bit dry and read? But if you are someone who cannot afford a teacher, and you are motivated, this is a truely excellent learning tool.It also helped me to think beyond just the welding and about the saftey of others."
2,COLOR,HOW DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR COLOR FOR THIS ITEM? I'D LIKE TO ORDER BUT I DON'T SEE AN OPTION FOR COLORS
4,We continue to use these after several years...,"We've found these to work very well. They don't leave spots or soap residue; no etching. Great with grease. This sent is quite nice, not overpowering like I thought it might be."
2,Packets don't always melt,The product is good when it functions properly. I have had many instances where the packets do not melt in the dishwasher and my water temperature is set very hot. I am not sold on the product because of the issue with packets not melting.
1,This is a phosphate free product,"I purchased this product specifically because it was listed as containing phosphates, When I got the product is says right on the bag phosphate free. Grrr how am I supposed to get my dishes clean? All this phosphate free stuff creates a nasty white residue on everything. I don't know what else to try. Very frustrated. Do not buy If you want Phosphate clean dishes"
1,Where's my phosphate??,"Live in an area where hard water is a big problem. Saw this item had phosphorus in the item description, however, it came to the house phosphate free. A real let down and more scummy cloudy dishes for me. Amazon was very good about returning it."
4,Total number is 100 NOT 160,I love this product but I was confused when I ordered them. The photo shows there are 32 packs per unit so I assumed there were 32 packs per unit and 5 units in a box for a total of 160 packs. I got these today and they were in 20 packs so the total quantity was only 100. There are more competitive places to buy there at that volume.
4,An excellent book - Sad,"This book is a MEMOIR, therefore it is the true journey of the author. It IS sad. I was very depressed at the end of the book.But with all of that said - I can see how this book can be an invaluable comfort to others who are struggling with cancer - or really with any serious tragedy. I understood the thoughts and feelings of the author so much throughout, even though I myself have never battled cancer. Miriam Engelberg's bravery to put her honest thoughts into a book is a gift to anyone who has ever felt isolated because of tragedy.Not everyone's story ends in triumph, but by creating an accurate account of her own thoughts and feelings, Miriam touched universal feelings that are deep within us all. She unites us through her truth - a gift that she herself seemed to rarely receive. Miriam may be gone, but her legacy ensures that no one like herself ever has to feel alone again."
5,Comic Genius,"This book present facts, emotions and all other kinds of stuff in a way that makes you laugh at the whole perversity of the universe. Worth a read, definitely worth owning -- especially for the newly diagnosed."
3,Disappointed,Would have been a decent read except for the crude and vulgar street language...that ruined it for me.
5,Refreshing take on living with cancer,"Miriam gets it right in each cartoon panel, revealing her fears, relaying her lack of belief in a superior being who doesn't seem to be overly interested in what happens to some of us ""down here"", and the weird/stupid stuff she goes through during her cancer treatments -- wig shopping, perusing the ""uplifting"" manuals and books available on the subject of facing one's cancer diagnosis, and much more.In comic book form, one person's very thoughtful take on what it means to be alive and facing death at the same time becomes real for every reader. Couldn't be better.Karen Aitchison"
4,Inside Humor for Survivors,"I opened up this book to a random page when I was walking home from the bookstore. I started laughing and kept peeking at new pages as I walked. When I got home, I sat down and read the whole book. When I showed my husband some of the cartoons, he started laughing. If you're a breast cancer survivor who appreciates off-beat humor and stark honesty, give this book a chance. As a warning, there's not a happy ending."
5,How Cool Is this Book!,"bluebear rocks!how many times can he escape death! walter moers has created an astounding work of art, and the excellent illustrations make the book even better.everyone should read this book, large print, so dont be put off by the number of pages!you'll love it!james"
1,Very poor performance,"Totally dissapointed with the GPS performance. Lacks power, very limited capacity to perform as a GPS and as a navigator. I wasted most of the battery capacity waiting to connect to a satellite signal. If you do not have the streets & Trips software it gets even worse. My opinion buy a GPS or a navigator from Magellan or Garmin there performance is outstanding."
1,Lasted about six months then quit,"Last time I buy a Krups product. I thought I was getting something special. Was I ever surprised. Took forever to make coffee. Steam everywhere as it brewed and would have ruined my cabinets if I hadn't moved from underneath. It has an overflow slot in case a person is too stupid to fill properly. (Are we all idiots?) The brew selector is a joke. What does it do? Darned if I know. The filters do what, exactly? Expensive and hard to optain. Now the final insult. Quit working in the middle of the brew. I pulled out my $10 Wal-Mart special (Sunbeam) finish up. The manual is near worthless. What a royal dissappointment. I guess it is still under warranty but I doubt if I will even bother. Chaulk it up to experience. What has happened to German ""quality?"""
1,Drip Queen,"This coffee maker would be great except that whenever you pour it, the coffee leaks all over the counter. Would not recommend this to anyone...."
1,Great coffee for 9 months....,"We purchased this coffee maker in September. We were delighted with the coffee that was brewed. This is mid-April and we awoke to find that the coffee maker does not work. The warmer does not warm and the coffee maker does not brew. What a huge disappointment. I researched the maker, but it just goes to show, sometimes, you get a lemon."
2,Makes great coffee but has a really short life!,"I am so disappointed. I loved this coffee but it just stopped working for no apparent reason. After reading the other comments, I realize it is probably a lost cause. This machine is only 1.5 years old. My previous Krups lasted 15 years!"
3,"Great idea, but...........","This such a great idea, but other than a few game board references. Really thought the game pieces and ? cards would have been KU themed. Obviously I bought this for a KU alum and he was disappointed to say the least. Too bad, I was going to by one for myself as well, but now......."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"This book is a quick simple read and makes some great points. However, If you are looking for something to really help you kick the gossip habit you will need to use this book in conjunction with another more agressive tool."
3,Wispering Words,"The book makes some basic religious assumptions. Persons who believe gossip is a useful social tool will disagree with those basic assumptions. I enjoyed reading the book, and now, appreciate it as a useful reference on the subject."
5,Going for the Gold,"Excellent Book! This book reminded me that I DO want to ""Go for the Gold"" in my relationships in all areas of my life. I want to manifest integrity and be regarded as a trustworthy person, and I believe the first step in obtaining this ""higher ground"" is to speak well of others when they are not present. If gossiping is the only social skill (or one of the best social skills a person possesses), I believe reading this book with an open heart would cause one to examine one's social skills and make a few changes for the better."
3,Good but lacking at the same time.,This book has some good points in it. But it does lack substance. Could have went deeper with this topic.
5,"Many are called to be read, few are chosen!","Just as 'many are called, but few are chosen', many books are written, but few have impacted my life as much as Gossip. It will cause you to take a serious look at your speech and how your words can literally destroy not only relationships, but individuals as well. The path to greater happiness, by eliminating harmful discussions from your daily conversations, will literailly jump off the pages for you as it did for me. It is an easy read but powerful in content. I highly recommend it IF you want happier relationships."
2,misleading,"It is crystal clear and a hard fact that 911 tragedy has NOTHING to do with China. Therefore, this book's title ""China's Master Plan to Destroy America"" and the companion cover picture of New York twin tower under attack are MISLEADING readers. It is irresponsible and vicious. It is going to MISLEAD USA's war on terrorist to an ENTIRELY WRONG direction and it is going to destroy the peace of the world."
1,The cover is misleading,The cover of the book is misleading. China has nothing to do with September 11.
1,A bad misleading!,"This is purely marketing by producing such a sensational story to sell more books. This translation communicate bad messages, misleading the anti-terroism war into wrong direction.US and China should be friends and do business together..."
2,This material is available for FREE on Internet,"The text of this book is available for free on the Internet. The marketing is sensationalistic and does not tap into what really is in the book. Previous articles have mentioned that using civilain aircraft as bombers and hiding behind bin Laden were tactics advocated by this book- however the language is far more subtle than that, and nowhere is there direct advocacy of anything. The book purports to be a prediction of directions for future warfare. If the Chinese were indeed behind 9-11, no case could be made from this book alone."
2,misleading,"Actually as soon as this book appeared in china,it was blamed much about the content and strategy.And the chinese name of this book is only ""unstricted warfare"".So I think the english name of this book is irresposible and vicious."
3,What this book tells us,"This book tells us of the current administrations future plans for China. I say this, because the organization which so helpfully translated it for us, is so closely linked to the President. I don't think they would translate anything they didn't want us to know, or that was not in their own best interests (do you?). Unfortunately, this means China is on the list of nations they consider a threat to America, which in the current political climate can only mean one thing. I wish I could say the information in the book was not true, but I don't know that. However, the information in the book is not presented in context, and is far too sensationalist for my liking. I visted the website of Newsmax.com (the people behind this book) and did not find fair, or balanced reporting. I suggest that you read 'The Chinese' by Jasper Becker as well as, or instead of this book. Becker gives us a full, fair, and balanced account of modern China, including it's military capability."
1,shame on the translator of this book,"This is a book written about 3-4 years ago by a China army officer, this is a pure academic book that details the new ideas of an unbalanced warfare.I don't understand why two country 10000 miles apart will want to destroy each other, and I don't know why author use such a misleading title. The original title is just unbalanced war, the example used in book is USA for the simple reason that US has been the one who suffers more on such kind of warfare."
1,Pure garbage and feeble fallacy,"The authors are very much disenfranchised with the People's Republic of China and the fact that they wrote this drivel is surprising, especially given the supposed ranks of some of the authors - which are undoubtedly false as well.I am surprised [website] even offers this garbage. Oh yes, freedom of speech and all that!This book is not worth the paper it was printed on! Absud trash and akin to urban myth generation - better material can be found on snopes.com - for FREE!"
1,Nonsense,This is just another nonsense fairy tale.It reminds me of a recently published bookon 9/11 written by a French who suggeststhat US Military Right Wing bombed WTC andPentagon and blamed it on Bin Laden.
1,A junk book harms the peace between US and China,Not worth reading at all! It just tries to use your curious to earn your money...
3,discrepancy of cover and subtitle,"At first glance, I thought this book was about 9-11 attack. I was totally fooled by the cover instead. After reading the book carefully, I found the sub-title ""China's Master Plan to Destroy America"" has nothing to do with the cover at all. Not to mention that China is in alliance with US to fight terrorism. A good book should be honest and straight-forward, but NOT misleading.I am not sure why the editors of this book chose 9-11 scene as the cover. Maybe they just felt it would attract more eye balls. What a trick!I guess next time, I could write something like ""Unbalanced Economy: Japan's master plan to control the world"" and with a cover showing 9-11 scene as well."
1,misleading cover page,"1.The cover page of the book is totally misleading! China has nothing to do with the 911 attacking. On the other hand, the country is one of the victims.2.the subheading is also misleading because this book is not focusing on america at all.stupid publisher."
1,Very Bad,"Seems like this another one of those read-my-nonsense book, I have no idea what's the intention behind this book, trying to start WWIII? THis book is a polution to minds."
3,Nice but NOT Static Free!,"This is a nice brush, but I don't find it to be static free as advertised. It works nobetter at keeping my hair from flying away as any other brush I've tried. It's a nicebrush otherwise however."
4,sweet,"Certainly Goodnight Moon is a classic for a good reason and the Runaway Bunny is a favorite of many (even if the ending is lame, in my opinion) but I didn't like the final story so much. No doubt this is the reason they were bound all together in one book--to sell the great and above-average story along with the dud story at the end. So, we just read the first two and skip the last one."
4,Over the Moon,"This is a nice collection of stories. I would have preferred a better paper quality, but overall, the book is a nice addition to stories my grandchild can read TO ME at bedtime."
5,Over the Moon,This book is a constant in our family. Every child has had one and will not part with it. So we must go out and buy each child his/her own! I recommend it for all children as a perfect bedtime story.
2,"One bound book, not a collection of books","Be aware that this is just one book with the three stories printed inside. It is not three separately bound books. Of course we love these stories, but I would have preferred three individually-bound books rather than this version."
2,Disappoined & returning,"I was expecting a collection of the 3 individual books & was disappointed to receive all three, bound in one (like chapters). I'm returning & have reordered the books separately. The pictures & layout of the book weren't anywhere near as nice as the original, individual ones either. I used to read these to my own children night after night when they were little & am purchasing them now as a baby present."
3,Interesting concepts,"This book is the only one I could find that attempts to explore the gravitational mystery spots by scientific experiments. It is good in that it gives a list of similar places in the US, and in that it makes an attempt at some demonstration of the anomaly by quartz crystal frequencies, weight scale and other measurements. But the Theory of Multidimensional Reality is rather a shot from 'Men in Black'! Also some common sense experiments such as those using a bubble level, laser, pendulum and compass are just not done. However, since it is the only thesis I could find on such anomalies, I think it is worth it."
5,A MUST Have Book,"This book gives an excellent introduction into one of the MOST profound NATURAL mysteries on the earth today. A MUST read for ZPE and GRAVITY researchers and experimeters.The book explores what is called ""shrink-grow"" phenomena and what I call ""mass fluctuations"".Vogt uses Special Relativity (SR) as a mathematical bases for his theory."
2,Cute Shoe,"This shoe is very cute if you wish to add a little flavor to your wardrobe. The flower detail that offers a variety of colors provide an opportunity to match these shoes with several colors. I gave this shoe four stars instead of the perfect five because the shearling on one shoe had more than the other. The look was not horribly noticable, but noticable none the less. These shoes because of the shearling issue are worn only with pants, but they look great."
1,AWFUL DVD RELEASE OF A GREAT SHOW,"The show itself deserves 4-5 stars, but this release of mostly edited episodes is a slap in the face to fans. Without realizing it, I bought this season, and like others on this page was furious at the many chopped up episodes on this disc. How come almost 60 year old I Love Lucy can present full episodes and extra scenes and commentary, but a recent show like this can't? Thank you Amazon for your liberal return policy. And shame on you LionsGate."
1,will and grace,"I never received this product and i purchased it, I couldn't get any contact information, to tell anyone that I had not received it so i am very displeased, and note I have not purchased anything from amazon with my personal credit card since then."
5,Isn't It a Shame!,"Isn't it a shame that one of the best sitcoms in years can only be released on DVD one season per year! At this rate, we'll have the last season by the turn of the decade!"
1,Disappointed,"I have waited a year for this release, and was very upset to find out, as so many have already mentioned, that the episodes are not complete. At first I thought I was crazy, but then my favorite line (in the Madonna episode) was completely missing (where Jack says ""as a gay man, I'm oddly attracted to you"" and Madonna/Liz says ""I know, I get that a lot""). What was Lion's Gate thinking? I think they really need to re-release the season, and allow people (who purchased this rip-off) free exchanges."
2,Episodes still great despite a scandalous DVD release,"I couldn't believe that so many episodes were cut. AND really, how dumb is it to have Deborah Harry's appearance in the episode guide on the box and then to cut out her scene? I liked this season a lot but LIONSGATE should really be ashamed. For me, it is particularly annoying because I have never seen the full-length episodes."
4,Will and Grace Season 5,"Once again, another installment of the Will and Grace Series. It's great to have the 5th season on DVD but I wish there were more extras. Cast interviews or more deleted scenes would be great. It seems more and more studios are quick to release series out there with out expanding on the extras. Enough with the quick buck guys, hardcore fans such as myself live for this stuff. Still it is great to finally have them just being released since England has had them for about a year ... all 8 SEASONS! Gee, thanks Warner Brothers!"
1,What Hubris!,"It says a lot about the hubris of mankind that we look for ""intelligent life"" in the stars instead of right here on earth.Did we eliminate cetaceans, higher primates and elephants from the running simply because they don't build cities? Because they don't dominate their environments like we do? Because they don't look like us? Because they don't speak English?What does that say about our response to an extra-terrestrial intelligence should we ever find one? Would we even recognize it?If even 1% of the SETI budget was redirected to animal language studies, I suspect we'd be able to talk to ""alien"" intelligences right now."
2,Not Enough Philosophical Implications,"I was expecting a ""what if?"" scenario of the impact the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have on our society. Too much of this book was either historical or reflective of the 1996 wisdom regarding the existence of extraterrestrial intelligences.The table of contents provides the best indicator of what this book is really about. Here it is with my observations about each chapter in parentheses.1. A Brief History of SETI (self-explanatory)2. Extraterrestrial Microbes (a biology lesson)3. Alien Message (exploring the probable types of messages we might receive)4. Against Aliens (exploring the probability of aliens and their similarity to us)5. The Nature of Consciousness (self-explanatory)6. Alien Contact and Religious Experience (current and biblical UFO stories)If you are interested in history, biology, and dated wisdom, then this is a good book for you. For me, I don't think it ""explores the ramifications"" to the extent that I had hoped it would."
3,are we alone,"this book is ok on my list i just wanted to read it cause i was some what skeptical of the whole ET thing, the book didn't reveal anything that I didn't all ready know, but it was refreshing anyway, I would recommend it to anyone who is not sure that ET's are real or not, this book will make you think more along the lines of ""what if all this is real."" . injoy the book I did."
5,We'll never be alone with food for thought like this.,"This book is a clear, concise well written overview of an incredibly complex subject - life elsewhere in the universe. While one may find much more detail and technical coverage in volumes twice the size, the author manages to pack alot of intellectual punch for a book this small.Highly recommended as a great starting point for amateur astronomers and students of the universe everywhere."
3,"Interesting and educational, but flawed by opinion.","This is an insightful and thought provoking book that is somewhat unclear of what it wants to be. A more appropriate sub-title for the book would have been; ""Philosophical Implications of the Existence of Extraterrestrial Life."" The greatest flaw of the entire book is that early on the author points out theories such as, ""That which is possible in nature tends to become realized."" and ""In an infinite universe anything that can happen will happen, and happen infinitely often."" The author then goes on to state his opinion a number of times that aliens could never traverse the great distances between stars so he will only discuss the implications of contact with aliens via radio communications. Apparently the last quote also applies to the human ability to underestimate science, intelligence and human (alien) will. I would have been willing to give a higher rating if the author had not made such an erroneous statement."
3,WWIII: Artic Front has severral glaring errors,"WWIII: Artic Front has many glaring error. For instance, in the previous book there was a nuclear exchange near the end but in this book they are already launching subs from a base that took a direct hit by a nuclear missle. In addition, General Freeman found time to fight in the Gulf War when he was leading the army in korea and europe. He was also able to lead the fighting in Minsk and lead the russian surrender precedings as he was being held captive by the chinese. If you can let go of those error the book is still enjoyable to read."
4,this is probably the best of the WWIII series,but slater screwed up didn't the book before this have a massive nuclear war where missles where launched on US and Russian targets yet no mention of the fact in this book that is the reason that I can't give this book 5 stars
5,"If you know about McLeod's Daughters, you know Lisa Chappell","My wife really like her in McLeod's Daughters. I bought the CD as a surprise gift after she watched the final episode - eight seasons! (thank you NETFLIX and Roku - instant viewing). Lisa has a great voice. Glad to help a new up and coming artist get started. Great voice and great songs - what else can you ask for. Not sure why, but the CD info does not register on the display screen - guess that is because it is not produced in the US. Very minor point - still a very good CD."
4,I keep listening,"I bought this the day I was going to see Sasha & Digweed perform in NYC and was in the mood just to pick something up and listen to. But I keep listening. Has the pace of club music at about the 1am peak hour, very up rhythms. I like the album a lot, just don't give out 5's easily"
2,Koestler aged and lost,"Koestler led an interesting life, but here is perhaps the duller part of his life. The biography is quite clearly unfinished, and unpolished. Cynthia, his wife who wrote the second part of the book is quite obviously besotted and under the control of Koestler (Koestler's relations with women were seldom sympathetic). It talks of the more mundane middle class lifestyle that Koestler got into, perhaps compensating for all the upheavals of his younger days. But by the time this was written most of Koestler's creativity was over and done, with even on scientific matters and capital punishment. Euthanasia and suicide was his last cause and one that overshadows this book... as it does unconsciously his relations with females...Both Arthur and his wife, died in a suicide pact while this book was being written. AK was greatly dehabilitated and in pain at the end, but the controversy remains as to why Cynthia joined him in death and did AK bully her into it?"
1,Don't be fooled,"The 12-pack of same product is 1/2 the price. If you bought 2 of those packs, you'd get 4 more rolls than buying this pack, at the same cost (as of this writing, anyway)."
1,Junk,"When 3 out 5 discs failed to burn I thought it was my Macbook Pro's superdrive that was defective. But then I used a friends brand new external burner and got the same results. Luckily I happened to buy these when Circuit City was about to close so they were $2.50 a pack. You get what you pay for, don't waste money on these."
4,Scientific Posters made Easy,"This is an excellant book. Contains lots of useful information about the do's and don'ts of making a good scientific poster. A great deal of information about basic layout that is clearly presented. Just what the beginner needs. Even the most experienced graphic designer would find this material useful. Towards the back of the book is a chapter on ""Common Poster Design Blunders"". This chapter contains many critique's of both badly designed posters and well designed posters. It is always good to see real eaxmples."
5,Mind-Blowing!,"Unlike a lot of people, I prefer studio music over live music when it comes to recordings, but this is my fav NUFAN album ever. These guys are totally awesome live, and it translates remarkably well onto the CD. The song selection is great as well, and I simply can't get enough of this album."
5,4 and a Half Stars,"I really like no use, I have two of there other albums (Making Friends and More Betterness), but IMO, this one is the best. It has a really good mix of songs (Soulmate, Straight from the Jacket, Room 19...), and they all sound as good as the actual recordings they were on. I think that the live version of ""Soulmate"" on this cd is better than the studio one, and that doesnt happen very often. Not all of the songs are Great, But Most of them are."
5,NUFAN at its best !!!,"Surely this is the best nufan cd... Lately they have been making slower songs (but it doesn't mean they are bad), but in this cd they show how hardcore they were...This cd brought me to nufan, and it's a good choice if you're curious about this band."
5,awesome,The new nufan cd live in a dive is (...) awesome.by far the best live album yet. The cd is full of raw No Use for a Name energy. The cd is altogether another awesome record that nufan has released.
4,Coca-Cola,"Pretty good book...A story concerning the lifes of 8 kids deeply involved in cocaine trade in NYC during the 1980's. It is told from the point of view of an outsider looking in, which I would have rather seen it documented from the 'kids' view but what can you do? Bricks of coke, cut, re-rocked, packaged, street level retail, and all the nitty-gritty details involved with the process. If your looking for a book that tells the tale of the route of cocaine from the source, into the nose/arm of a user, and the people that make it happen. This book is for you, I am a sucker for this type of literature [drug-porn] so take my review with that in mind.http://www.junkylife.com/seedless"
1,Irrelevant and unscientific ethnography,"If you are looking for more of a journalistic description and a short, amusing read, then this book is for you. He includes irrelevant details. It is more an ethnography of urban relationships in the context of the drug trade than of the drug trade proper.If you are after a scientific ethnography of drug-selling, then I'd recommend Phillipe Bourgois' In Search of Respect. Avoid this book - it is not worthwhile if you are a sociologist or anthropologist."
3,Average book,This book is okay but it isn't laid out very well and it's not user friendly. It skips around and is redundant in many areas. The content is good and the last half of the book is an index of techniques and assessments (which is the only truly useful and well written part) but it's not written well and not my favorite. I gave it 3 stars mainly because of the technique and assessment index in the back.
1,Robo C-R-U-D,"If I can dissuade just one person from wasting a few dollars on this tedious bore, then I won't feel so bad about the money I wasted on this turkey.It's not ""funny-bad"" or ""sexy-bad""... it's not even ""B-movie bad"". It's just bad.Got it? B-A-D."
4,Best c resource,"This book is perfect if you have two things: (1)a very basic background in ANSI c, (2)a intermediate bacground in 8051 assembly.This book is NOT a beginner step by step book in which a reader could learn the 8051 and c with this single book. I had a firm handle on writing assembly and c code for the 8051. Unfortunatly I was pretty unclear how one could have much memory control using C. Shultz's book answered it all for me including how one would control and interrupt vector table with C.Shultz obviously knows what he is doing and leaves some information to the reader to figure out. The book is rather expensive for the sheer amount of information that could be obtained. If this were handled better, this book would have recieved a 5-star.I'll certainly recommend this book to anyone looking to fill in the gaps of mixing 8051 with the C language."
2,Computer Engineer,"I have read the reviews of those above me and have to ask... did they even read and *use* the listed material? Most everything of importance is in the footnotes which cover nearly 40% of the book. This is the second edition of his book, and still, he cannot get even FOR loop writen in asembly written correctly. Secondly, the Computer Engineering department of the University of Missouri - Rolla, has decided on a whole, the book is worthless. Too much time is spent correcting his errors as opposed to learning the material. What Shultz does do well is the methodology. It really is a shame he has no plans at all to go back and fix the errors in the book."
1,"Terrible, don't waste your money.","This book is extremely difficult to follow, nearly 30% of the content of the book is held in footnotes, making the text nearly impossible to comprehend. Most of the book is written in first person, and makes many dangerous assumptions about the background of the reader. None of the assumptions are listed and it is up to the reader to decifer them. This book is little more than a collection of class notes from a professor and would only be of value to someone actually taking the class. I am very sorry I wasted my money on this book."
5,Life Changing Book,"I encountered this small book in a store over 5 years ago and was ""teased"" by the chapter titles. I bought the book and read it quickly, then again over and over more thoughtfully over the next year or so. I found each chapter to be a five-minute invitation to a radically free life in Christ! I have since purchased 40-50 copies of this book and given it away to many! I especially love to give it as a high school graduation gift for exploring minds to encounter happiness in God. It is deep, but approachable. It is easy, but profoundly rich. It's succinctness makes it nag your mind until you wrestle with the treasure of truths that can be yours. I love John Piper's teaching gift and I share his inspiration from C.S.Lewis quotes. I highly recommend this little powerful book, and the ensuing search for God that it stirs."
3,Wordy but good,"Could have been said in half the space, but it presents a good concept. Well worth reading."
1,Bullying,"This writer's standard is a black burden, one more dreary demand to measure up. He's like a bully beating you over the head until you smile. Very very distressing."
2,The Sound Quality IS Dismal,"I must agree with the reviewers who point out the poor sound quality on most of the 25 tracks, although I have to disagree with the one who calls these ""B-cuts"" and not originals. They are the original recordings, all done from 1941 to 1949. They just weren't handled very well in transferring them to digital mode.The insert contains some interesting liner notes written in 2001 by Tony Watts in London, and this is what earns it one of the two stars awarded."
4,One of their best,"Sublime stuff here. There's nothing like the first 7 or so songs in terms of enticing melody and rhythmplay and lyric. They're allowed to fade out w/ a couple of ambient pieces toward the end of the album, but in about 18 Dots CDs I own, this is the one I'd take to the grave."
5,"Space, Time and Deity revisited","In his ""Structure of the Physical Universe"" series Larson attempted to instantiate the metaphysical system building of the Australian philosopher Samuel Alexander in a physical form. ""Beyond Space and Time"" is a continuation of that attempt, this time tackling Alexander's concept of emergent evolution. Is there more, something else, beyond space and time? Is our physical universe evolving towards deity like Alexander postulated?This book was Larson's posthumous surprise, and not surprisingly he provides no firm answers, only clues. There is much to debate in this book, but if you take the concepts of Hartley, Alexander, Whitehead, Teilhard de Chardin and the Process Theologists at least semi-seriously, then this work is also a must read."
5,This is a good buy.,"Hi. I'm Nicole from San Antonio, Tx. I've bought the Maximum Backstreet Boys CD. This CD is worth every PENNY! You could just buy a book about these boys but the CD has much more insight on the band itself. IT is a very good listen and offers GOOD INFORMATION. I don't want to give to much away so I would say that if you buy it your money has been well spent. **BSB*FOREVER**"
3,I'm getting bored. *Yawn*,"I don't get why BSB and *NSYNC fans just can't get along. It's all about the music, isn't it? Anyway, this CD gets a 3 because interview CDs bore me. This goes for *NSYNC interview CDs as well. I just can't stand how people go rate the CDs of people they don't like and give them 1 star without even hearing it.I bought this CD and sold it on eBay after listening to it once. Why? Because I'd heard half the interviews before...it's always the same thing. They always give the same interview answers because reporters always ask the same things! I would recommend buying Millenium *OR* NSA instead.Oh, and another thing--I am a die-hard *NSYNC fan, but I LOVE the new BSB song Shape of My Heart. It's awesome! Both groups are great...now, can't we all just get along?"
1,Barely works,"As reported, the volume button has a bad habit of blasting all the way to the max but I thought I could live with it. However this is clipped to my backpack with the Ipod inside and it cant even consistently fast forward through songs or skip back and forth."
2,Monster iEZ Click works so so...,"I bought this remote for use in motorcycling. The following is an excerpt is from a post I wrote on a motorcycling forum.It appears that when the ipod's battery starts to run low the the communication between the iEZ transmitter and receiver becomes erratic. This also may be caused by possible RF interference. It's almost as if the receiver only gets 1/2 a command from the transmitter. When I went to adjust the volume up or down it would keep on adjusting and not stop, either blasting my ears or turning the volume completely down. This is a bad thing when you are riding on a twisty road, the ipod is buried away and you can't pull your earphones out. At one point I was litterally stuck for up to a minute with my ipod maxed out unable to do anything. I had to pull off the road to dig out my ipod in order to turn it down."
4,Pairing??,"Has anyone been able to activate the ""pairing"" feature? I often ride with other snowboarders who have this product and we end up controlling each other's iPods. I tried to activate pairing and it doesn't seem to work. Other than that I like the product."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH I TOUCH,No where in the description did it say it was not compatible with the i-touch. Not worth the hassle of returning it. Will give it to someone with a older ipod.
2,Another Monster Product,"Yet another Monster product, aka one that doesn't even do what it's supposed to. Only on a few occasions of using this device did I actually get it to work. I have not tried it with iOS6 yet, but I can only assume that it won't work with that either."
2,Doesn't work most of the time,I went thru 3 and they never sync up we'll and don't control when I need it too so I have it on the shelf with all the other waste on money items I have purchased.
2,it works for the most part!! sometimes,Strapped the remote to the handle bar my only problem with it is it doesnt always turn on or wake up the ipod. and it doesnt always link right away i changed the battery but sometimes it takes a few time to link cause when its not linked you cant do anything
1,Does not work at all,"It seems like it is hit or miss with this product. You would think they would have worked the bugs out by now. As for me, it did not work at all. The play pause feature is the only one that worked on my iphone 4. The fast forward button only worked after pushing it twenty times. It is a very frustrating item. I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,I love it!,"I bought this for my ""classic"". I've never really had a problem with it that was inconsistent with the technology. Yes, sometimes I feel like I have pressed a button a nothing seems to happen...I just repeat the process with success. I use it skiing, snowmobiling, mowing the lawn, sometimes in my car. It's super easy to use and has great range. I can dock my ipod into the stereo in the family room and control it from my wrist in the kitchen (Not line of sight). I recommend this product. I mean $20. Really? It's a bargain."
1,Does not work with iPhone 3GS,"This product does not work with iPhone 3GS, do not buy it for iPhone 3 or 4. Also, it does not work with iPod nanos, it blocks the earphone port.I sure wish it did. I can't find any similar product, would have loved to have this for snowboarding. Oh well."
4,Works great on motorcycle.,"Used with a 32 gig iPod Touch 2nd generation.I bought the remote for use when wearing headphones while riding sportbike. I used some heavy duty velcro to secure it to the triple tree and it works great. I had no problem manipulating the controls with my gloves on. I am really pleased with this product.One thing that is worth mentioning is that when the remote receiver is plugged into the iPod, the internal speaker is disabled."
3,Fell off my wrist and lost it the first day,"Bought the Monster IPod remote from Amazon tested it, worked great but I should have heeded the earlier review I read.First day skiing it separated from the adjustable wrist strap fell off my wrist. It never even made it to the first chairlift ride.Come guys what did you do design this thing and forget how to attach it then give that design task to some first year student intern?I'm on this website now because I'm ordering yet another one from Amazon Maybe they are all in this together and smarter than I think.Monster AI REMOTE iEZClick Remote Control for iPod"
3,Good Product - Velcro Didn't Hold,"I am now buying this for the second time. I was very pleased with it, but when I got back from apres ski the other day, the wristband was missing from my jacket, the velcro didn't hold. While I have experienced the volume issues described in the other reviews, for the most part, I have found that the buttons work pretty consistently."
1,Poor Quality Control,The product worked fine out of the box except for the Fast Forward/Skip Track button. It would only work in FF mode if you pressed it extremely hard - and by that I mean you have to grasp the whole unit from front to back and pinch the button as hard as you can. It would not do the Skip Track function at all.Amazon sent a replacement out which arrived a few days later. Great customer service! Except the replacement did not work at all.Would have given this 0 stars if that was an option.
1,Monster iEZClick Not Recommended,This product does not work very well. Remote only works sometimes. Replaced battery with no improvement. Volume button has habit of sticking on blasting your ears so be careful. I have read other reviews with simular experiences.
2,"Neat Idea, but Doesn't Work Very Well","I bought this remote as a gift for my boyfriend who likes to listen to his iPod while running/working out. It sounded like a very convenient idea, and it is, when it actually works, which is not often.It seems you have to have it in the exact right position at the exact right distance for it to have any effect on your iPod at all. We tried every way we could think of and it still only controlled the iPod when it wanted to.Also, the wrist band is difficult to adjust and we had trouble getting it to snugly fit my boyfriend's fairly large wrists, so I can't imagine it would work at all for a woman with smaller wrists like mine.Overall, not work the purchase because it's aggrivating to use and doesn't work the way it should."
1,Not recomended,"This product did not work at all like described, the only way it would even sometimes work was to hold, it a max of two inches away from the ipod and even then it would more likely skip through the song rather than skip the song all together. There isn't a chance this would have worked through clothes let alone through walls."
3,"Worked great, at first","Always a tough call when a product has such mixed reviews. But, seeing no better options out there, I decided to take the chance. I am using this on my motorcycle to control a 2G iPod Nano. For the first 1,000 miles of on and off use over two trips, it worked fine and I was quite pleased. However, after a few days of non-use, I took the iPod and AI Remote with me for another ride and experienced the same issues reported by so many others. Buttons would either not respond or would continually repeat the selected command - whether that be a volume adjustment, track change, or play/pause. I'm not done with it yet, as I want to use it some more to see if I can figure out what changed. However, given the experience I've had what could have been a 5-star is now no better than a 3."
3,"Works well, only about a 3' range though.","Works well, only about a 3' range though. Volume buttons sometimes go haywire, i.e. hit + and it goes all the way to max volume. Worth the price though."
4,not too shabby,"This product works as advertised so far. I have not used it when the battery is low, which is when everyone seems to have a problem. However when I first got this product i tried and tried and couldn't get a single response from it. I thought maybe it had no battery but it was in it, so i called Monster about it. They say they discontinued it a year and a half ago. So then I changed the battery out and that was the problem. It had just sat on the shelf so long the battery went dead on it. After that it has worked like a charm. Good luck, and expect to spend a little extra on a new battery (watch type)."
1,Didn't Work,It never worked. I had another one that worked fine but unfortunately I lost everything except the dongle. Very disappointing as it was great for snowboarding.
3,Doesn't work EDIT--- Barely works with iPhone,"I bought two of these - one for my SO's use with an iPod and one for my use with an iPhone. It's fine for the iPod - works as advertised with no major issues. However, DO NOT buy this product for your iPhone, as it does not work!!! You will not get any sound when you plug the device into your phone. Although the display shows that a song is playing - and use of the remote demonstrates that the remote changes songs - no sound comes from the headphones. Which pretty much defeats the purpose of the remote...EDIT---Okay it does work with iPhone but the instructions don't tell you how to make it work. First, unplug your headphones from the phone. Then, plug in the little receiver to the bottom of your phone. Open iTunes on your phone. Dismiss the annoying message telling you that your phone won't work properly. THEN plug in your headphones. Viola! It works!"
1,Not so good,"This is the first time that I have sent in a review of a product. I was anxious to receive this device for use on my mountain bike. Monster usually makes good (if pricey) products. But that was not the case for the iEZClick remote control. When adjusting the volume, a quick press of the button would occasionally send the volume to either the maximum or minimum, depending which way I directed it. It didn't happen consistently, but it did happen often enough to render the device useless. The volume would vary between ear-splitting and silent. As clumsy as my wired remote is at least it functions properly. I sent the remote back for a refund."
3,Ipod adapter for remote,If you have your ipod plugged into your stereo system and the adapter for the remote doesn't fit very well so it goes in and out.
2,DON'T get this,"The other reviews are right; this is a horrible buy. Biggest drawback: when you plug the little wireless dongle into your ipod...it COVERS UP the headphone jack.To boot, it's incredibly spotty - the ""play/pause"" button works MAYBE a third of the time, and the volume controls don't work at all. When I called the company for support, they only told me they ""don't offer assistance for this product"". Yeah I'm returning this."
3,Did not work for me,"I feel like it did not specify the working range, if it had I wouldn't had bought it, it may work for very short distances but I needed like 10 feet and it stop working at around 5 feet."
4,Works fine for me,"Despite reading some bad reviews, I purchased it anyway because it was a cheap gamble. So far, it has worked exactly like it should. I haven't had it or used it for very long, but no real complaints. It worked for the 8 hours I needed it on the mountain for 4 straight days."
1,"Great concept, poor execution","I have both an older 4th gen iPod Photo (60gb) and a 5th gen iPod Video (60gb) for which it works fine except for the Next track button. Of course, other than turning it on and off or play/pause is a pretty crucial feature. Their India help desk didn't offer me any suggestion other than to return it to the vendor as it's discontinued. Should be a great product. Seems like quality control sucks. Steer clear.[...]"
1,didn't work,"its cheap quality, the plug for the ipod feels cheap, has a sticker covering the antenna that you could end up damaging the antenna. the clicker part is nice and big but it doesn't work, i had a remote from ijet that works much better, it has a pass through so you can have something else plugged in to the bottom of the ipod and stil have the remote plugged in. the monster remote would be nicer, but since it didn't work and following the instructions to reset it and repair it and it still didn't workwouldn't waste my time on monster iezclick again"
2,works 50 percent of the time,"I purchased this product from amazon.com. The problem I have is when you press the volume + button, it dosent just turn it up a little bit. It will max out the volume making you have to rip out the head phones from your ears to save what little hearing you have left. And it will do the same with volume - button. When this button is pressed the volume goes all the way down. I tried changing the battery with the same results. Also this product has about 16 inchs of range."
2,Pretty bad,Pressing the buttons doesn't means the ipod is going to respond. The volume goes up and down after pressing the button just once. The receiver that needs to be plugged into the ipod fell apart and I have it now put together with duct tape. One day I was jogging and the volume went up so much that I couldn't control my self and I smashed that stupid remote control against the ground. I hate this product. If somebody knows about a different brand with a similar product please post it here so I can buy a good one. Thanks
4,Works for me,Works with a classic ipod. Great for our last ski trip. Not sure if this will work with the touch or other versions.
5,Great Buy!!,"First off, this item was discontinued by monster a year or two ago. Therefore when you recieve the iezclick you must replace the battery in it, it's a very cheap fix. These things retailed fo $70 when new. It is ideal for someone who rides motorcycles. I'm very happy I found this product so cheap, I bought 2!"
3,Batteries!!!,"Received the remote and followed the instructions and NOTHING, DEAD, NO FUNCTION. Figured that I should have listened to the other reviews. Thought before I toss this POS into the trash, I would check the battery with a volt meter. Imagine that, 1.5v on a 2.0v battery. Off to Radio Shack and $6 later I have a new battery. Put it and it works exactly as advertised.If you are having a problem with the remote, suggest you check the battery. Might just solve all the problems I've read about.Still pretty bad that I had to spend an additional $6 to make it work. Therefore, 3 stars."
2,Not Good for Cold Weather,IEZ Click worked for about 3 hours on the slopes in Mammoth. After that it would just shut the iPod off. We have 2 of them and they both started doing the same thing. I'm guessing it's the weather or alltitude. Still works at home just fine.
2,Very buggy product,"Confirming the other reviews on this product, the item is quite buggy. The product has very unreliable issues with the volume and when it is increased can keep going by itself to maximum or goes all the way to volume when decreased.I use this item when riding my motorcycle with my the ipod on under my helmet. So once I set the volume I'm ok. It's nice to have the pause when I stop next to one of my riding buddies and I don't have to dig out the ipod to pause it to hear what he is saying. That and the next/previous track buttons seem to work fine. Don't know why the volume is so buggy but for the cheap price I paid for it I can live with it. The unit straps real nice to my handle bar next to the grip."
3,Description,"An old love goneCan never come backReturning to Old Beams was a mistake. Francesca had been happy while her mother had been housekeeper there, and when Francesca dreamed of marrying Giles.But everything was different now. Far from the peace of mind she'd sought as housekeeper to the new owner, Adam Greco, Francesca was troubled by her deception. Even worse, she'd fallen in love with him.""Adam,"" she begged, ""You must listen. I have so much to explain...."""
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to read to my very imaginative 5-year-old daughter who has just lost her daddy. When I bought it, I thought it was a story book that involved a little grieving character to which my daughter could relate.However, it is really more along the lines of a self-help book for children. It is obviously written by a grown-up talking to the child-reader about their ""loss of a loved-one"" and explaining to them what is happening.My child didn't like it at all, and as I was reading it to her, I found myself editing bits out or rewording it because it was all a little too heavy. Now when I ask her what book she would like me to read to her she replies; ""Not that yukky death one."""
3,Sad isn't Bad,I purchased this book to use in an elementary school setting. Personally I like the references to God in the book but professionally I am not able to use it as I had planned.
4,Sad Isn't Bad,"This was one of the books I purchased to read to my almost 4 year old grandson. His ""grandpa"" died 3 months ago. He loves being read to and we were able to talk about some of the memories he had of his grandpa.There were some parts of the book I did not read to him as I felt he was not ready for them. However, validation of his feelings really came through as a positive thing. I am sure we will explore more of this book as he really liked hearing about how it wasn't bad to feel sad."
4,Sad isn't Bad,"I had intended this book to be for my 4 yo grandson, it is more suited to my 12 yo niece. Still a nice book, very informational, and gave her lots to think about and even took some of the chapters to heart. She had lost her mother at 3 yrs of age and is lately showing signs of guilt and behavior problems."
3,Sad Isn't Bad,"This book is definitely for older kids - 7 upwards. It has a level of complexity to it and the pictures are just ok to look at. If kids are into Elf's, etc it would be good, but a book using more real to life characters would be better in my belief."
5,helping toddlers grieve,very good book for helping toddlers and children learn to accept the death of a family member
2,Way to specific for our purposes. :(,"I wish I had known this book was specifically about death. ""A Good-grief Guidebook For Kids Dealing with Loss"" is a euphemistic subtitle that made me think it would address all kinds of loss. Unlike the Elf-help book about anger, this story about sadness seems to assume that a child cannot experience significant loss through any means other than death. I was so hoping this would be a book that would help a little boy deal with the loss of his birth family and foster family as he moves to an adoptive home. He will be grieving as well, and will have more to mourn over than the loss of a single parent or grandparent. Unfortunately, this book cannot even be modified to fit our purposes, as every page is centered around death. What a disappointment."
2,"Good if you've lost Grandma, and believe in God...","Not nearly so useful if the person who has died is a sibling, or a parent. The book keeps telling the child to talk to their parents.... and the illustrations have a patchwork quilt cuteness that give an elderly feel to the missing soul. It does deal with anger being okay. It does say it's alright to cry. Not as helpful as I had hoped."
4,helpful to children,I found this book very helpful to my 7 year old when dealing with the stillborn death of his sibling. Reading it together helped us discuss certain emotions that we would not have brought up on our own. I recomend it for elementary age children.
4,Surviving Unemployment,"This timely book provides essential guidance for surviving the financial crisis of unemployment. With lay off's prevalent across the nation, Ms. Milligan's focused approach to ""problem solving"" the financial challenges of unemployment can benefit all who take the time to read. The book reads easily, and the ""My Best Advice"" sections provide succinct guidance. The tone of the book acknowledges the pain and despair which accompany being ""suddenly unemployed"", but firmly guides the reader towards the future and provides the tools necessary to make informed decisions about all aspects of one's personal finances along the way."
5,Black Pioneers of Science and Invention,"I am so pleased with this book that I ordered a third. If I had my way, I would add a + sign to the five stars. Believe me, I am going to keep this dealer in mind for anything else I need. Thank you. These books are beautiful.Bonita Evans, Ph.D."
4,Black Pioneers of Science and Invention,My 9 year old great-granddaughter aspires to be a scientist. This book has inspired her to do so. Thank you.
3,VERSACE CRYSTAL NOIR,"All is very good, but a smell completely not long though on clothes keeps all the day. Buy better in shop"
1,Too strong,"Oh dear, where can I start? Well, hubby took a whiff of this and instantly said, ""No hun. That does not smell good."" To top it off, it made me feel dizzy. I had to scrub it off of me. Glad I purchased a sample and not the full size."
3,Who's He?,"This CD has one maddening little problem: Though the arrangements are fine, the lyric sheets are sufficient, and the music itself is well performed, for some reason THERE IS A MAN WHO SINGS ALONG WITH YOU ON THE FIRST AND LAST LINE OF EVERY SONG. I suppose this is to help people who can't figure out when to come in (or when to finish), but I find it intrusive and infuriating. Since there is no split track, you can't get rid of him. On one song, the man even sings flat. (Bad enough he's going to sing, but can't he even get the notes right?) Without the voice, I would rate this a 5-star CD; as it is, it gets only 3."
1,don't buy this stupid cd,"this cd has someone singing, and not very well either. they sing the start of each song and you can't shut them up at all. Do not waste your money on this."
5,Very good service,"The book is used but in a very good condition, the delivery time was as I expected, everything on this order has good. Definitely I recommend this seller.And If you're looking for this kind of Marketing book, for me it's one of the best for Non-profits organizations."
3,well - written book....,"It's the most surprising and tragic story I've ever read.I've read this book 2 times and watched the film.Although I'm not a christian,the seven deadly sins are the most serious sins...OnlyGod can forgive us.The city always described as a mess,noise,gloomy,desperate and violence,and the weather had been raining,dark,mist and cloudy.But in the end,despite of cruelty story,the weather was brilliant.I think it's very ironical.Somerset has got 7days until he retires and doesn`t want to see any criminal.After he found the body of ""the fat man"" ,he knew, it wasn't going to be easy.Finally he decided to stay to fight the fight in the city."
3,Too Much Drawn Out Agony,"Our family listened to this book on librivox, and the entire book can be summed up in a few words: ""Oh, Evan, oh, Evan, oh Evan, oh Evan... Oh, I'm okay now!"" : ) This being pretty sharp criticism, I will say that it had Susan Warner's usual godly insight and teaching, along with her rather drawn out descriptions. Reading it instead of listening to it would be a good idea, because then you can skim a little. All in all, not her best work, but still worth reading if you are trying to find godly, truly wholesome books for your girls. I'd recommend it for girls 14-18 who are accustomed to reading books from the 19th century."
1,Complete JUNK!,"I purchased one of these about 2 yrs ago and also bought the extended 2 yr warranty. Worked decent for a couple months. Then it got to where it wouldnt record. Then it would say its recording and when you hit stop, it would say couldnt record. Sent it in and they supposably fixed it. Now it wont hardly accept a disc. It will say disc can neither be played nor recorded.Worst $300 I ever spent. Made me plenty sour on SONY!"
5,Sony DVD Recorder RDR-GXD455 W/ Built-in Tuner,Excellent recorder.I found easiest to set up and use comparedto other recorders. It's no wonder Sony is theRolls Royce of Home Electronics. I also own a Sony Bravia LCD TV
3,Really is cheaper,"Great product New in the Box works perfect Quick to collect money (1 day) but slow to ship (8days)and send tracking info Would buy again, but would hope for faster ship or at least easier way to obtain info"
1,Be Forewarned ...,"1) Plays approx. 75% of new retail DVD's without problems (which include repeated freezing & stuttering). 2) Records & plays back DVD-R & DVD+R discs w/o issue. 3) DVD-RW & particularly DVD+RW discs (Sony discs!) ... well, good luck. 4) Outside of these deal breaker isssues, my unit worked quite nicely. Sony's response ... something along the lines of user error/it must be all in my head. I strongly suspect the recording/playback problems are software encoded copy protect glitches. This unit will certainly be my last Sony product (3rd strike rule)."
4,"Exactly what I needed, but then I wasn't asking for much.","Just wanted to let people know that as a stand alone TV tuner with HDMI/Component output and all three tuner types, this was a bargain at $100 from cowboom dot com. I'm running a basic cable into it and picking up the digital/HD via QAM tuner and the picture is fantastic. I've read some limitations with the OTA tuner, but I'm not using it for that."
1,I am returning this unit,"THIS UNIT WOULD NOT RECORD A PROGRAM USING THE TIMER, IT ACTED LIKE IT WAS WORKING BUT IT DID NOT RECORD. IT WOULD RECORD USING THE RECORD BUTTON ON THE REMOTE, HOWEVER.HD TUNER IS OF NO BENEFIT BECAUSE IT ONLY SCANNED IN NORMAL BROADCAST CHANNELS FROM A FEW MAJOR NETWORKS. A LOT OF HD CHANNELS WERE MISSING AND YOU COULD NOT MANUALLY ADD. SINCE IT DOWN CONVERTED ...WHAT'S THE POINT.DID NOT DISPLAY CHAPTERS ON THE UNIT WHILE PLAYING A NORMAL MOVIE DVD."
2,junk,I had my 455 serviced in January(2009). Unit was fixed and returned. Worked for another 5 months then it started acting up. Informed Sony with much complaining they decided to fix for free. I received a call several days later that unit was unfixable and they would be returning my purchased price. I will give them credit for customer service. Don't buy this unit.
2,Delay from press remote to unit responds??,Was hoping this to be the best of DVD recorders but forget it because remote buttons are so small some require a pen to hit them & the unit doesn't respond especially during title list and sent unit back from frustration so maybe you won't have this trouble but Sony usually produce higher quality or maybe somebody else made this one & they put there name on it - I bought from Crutchfield and great customer service to return unit!!
2,DVD recorder,"I ordered and paid for a new unit. The recorder was dirty and dented and came in an old, beat-up box. The remote control didn't work. The supplier didn't have a replacement remote so he is going to send me a universal remote. I hope it works with the recorder.I have puchased quite a few large electronics from Amazon and this is the first time I've had a problem. I guess it's because it was an outside supplier."
3,Silent film.,"This is a silent film. I haven't seen it, but Amazon's description leaves that out. 1927 was the year they began talking films; so you can't tell by the year. I had to Google ""IMDB"" (International Movie Data Base)."
3,Well written and thought provoking,"Turning Points is a very well written book. I admire Mr. Noll because he is a very good writer. I like the things he has written about in this book as well. Turning Points is interesting and thought provoking. It would serve well as a jumping off point for further study of these areas of Christian history. I especially enjoyed the first two chapters. I do not always agree with Mr. Noll. I disagree with him in this book and in other writings. However, there is much to profit from in all his writings. I recommend this book."
3,Turning Points,Don't care for the type font. It does contain factual info. Will use as a resource text for term paper.
5,A great place to start a review of Christian history,"I'm just finishing this book and found it to be a thought provoking approach to the subject. Noll takes an openly evangelical approach to things, yet is very fair to the Catholics and the Orthodox. In fact, the chapters on monks and on orthodoxy were quite good. The format is also appealing, with each chapter bookended with hymns and prayers from the period being covered. The bibliography after each chapter is also very useful."
5,Great Easy Reading!,For a great overview of the history of the Christian Church - this is the book for you! Just enough detail to support the major events that influenced Christianity over the years!
5,excellent study,"A fantastic work from one of the best scholarly minds in evangelical Christianity. Noll's treatment is honest and fair, including enough detail without rambling. His writing, while still scholarly in tone, is thoroughly engaging and readable. This book is useful as an introduction to Church History, study guide for academia and local church, and supplemental text.It is also extremely valuable for our current situation in the American Church, in which pragmatism rules supreme and historical context is ignored.I highly recommend this work for anyone interested in Church history."
5,Great stuff--but with gaps,"This is an outstanding, balanced, evangelical presentation of several key events in the history of Christianity. Noll is one of the best writers of church history, and he never loses sight of the true context of Christianity, having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.However, to understand the book adequately, the reader needs a grasp of history that many lay-people don't have. The best book I've found to give this overview simply and clearly is _Christian History Made Easy_ from Rose Publishing. Together with _Christian History Made Easy_, _Turning Points_ provides the lay-person with an excellent breadth of knowledge of this subject."
2,Kinda Boring,"I'm a Beck fan indeed, but I don't like this book. Actually, I've only read one other Robert Beck (Iceberg Slim) book before, and that'd be Pimp. Pimp is much, much better by a long shot. This book definantly falls short of anything Pimp has to offer. It's not worth the buy, my friends. If you're interested in some great reading, may I suggest you basically choose anything by Donald Goines?"
1,Not very substantial,Out of the box part of the plastic housing around the fan shroud was broken. The cutout required for installation on either side leaves a very narrow margin in which to install the 'drywall anchors'. I ended up having to design and build a hardwood frame onto which I could mount the fan and intake grill on either side of the wall. Neither drywall anchors nor wire nuts were provided.You can't access the wiring box once the unit is installed. It has to be wired up then shoved in place. Standard 14ga romex wiring is difficult to get stuffed back into the wall cavity when mounting the fan. Ended up using 14ga stranded wire.In my opinion this is NOT an easy item for even the average home handy-person to install.
4,great product,"I just have one issue. the fan itself is warped causing it not to be able to go to half or full speed. can i get just the fan blade itself replaced. I have had it installed by a licensed electrician already. please reply with your help,"
5,Highy dancable but with an unusual hard trance edge,"Very typical of the UK React label this is hard trance for dance but highly listenable too. Not a single bad cut. The outstandings ones are CL McSpadden's ""Galea"" and Sandra Collins ""Flutterby"". XTC Web Radio has named this the number one UK trance album of 1999."
2,Get the metal ones,"These are plastic, they don't cycle well and damage easily. Use the metal AZoom snap caps."
5,Birth of the California Narrow Gauge,"Comprehensive history of early Pacific Coast railroad and transpiration history. Lots of interesting historical sketches of railroad people and their suppliers. How the railroads built up local economies. Also lots of technical detail, with explanations that will allow anyone with out prior knowledge to become well versed in the basics of railroad technology. This is an excellent book, a must have for any railroad oriented library collection."
5,The Birth of California Narrow Gauge-book,"Perfect, new condition, shrink wrapped for protection.Excellent Historical content. My husband was thrilled."
5,"anthology of skate photos, graphics, and illustrations","This book is beautiful. Thick, and extremely well designed mixing skateboarding photos, articles, and street stlye graphics and illustrations. Featuring such legendary artists as Futura 2000, Haze, and Shepard Fairey of ""Andre the Giant has a Posse"" fame. Not to mention photos and text about musicians such as DJ Shadow, Jeru, and Wu-Tang. For fans of this vein of art, music, and styles, this book is a masterpiece."
4,"Academic, but accessible","This book is written in an academic way, but is readable for a layperson such as me (as opposed to say, ""Imagined Communities""). Much of it is simply his synopsis and interpretation of nationalist philosophies, but the end is a great demonstration that its ok to be progressively minded, but identify with and even be proud of being from the US, or any nation in general really. Nations are human institutions, but they create the identities we grow up with."
3,Specification Wrong !,I bought these feet to put on my aluminum ladders having carefully looked at the size in the spec which stated they were 4 x 4.2 x 1.1 inches.In fact they were useless because the actual size is 2 1/4 x 1 1/2 x 1 inches. Returned them.
4,the real thing,"this shrimp paste, which came from far, far away, is the authentic product-- offensive to the Western sense of smell, but enhancing all Eastern dishes once it is cooked. My only problem with this product, which took about a month to arrive here, is that the jar is very small compared to most jars one sees in Asian groceries. Perhaps the number of ounces was listed on the website, but it must not have been displayed very prominently. Still, this stuff is so powerful that one uses very little at a time, so it should last a while."
5,The Other Side of Baseball,"Ken Kaiser doesn't care for baseball, but he doesn't have to cause he's an umpire. This book chronicles former American League Ken Kaiser's journey through the lowest of minor leagues to the lavish life style of the majors, up until the infamous umpire strike that led to his ultimate firing.Full of hilarious stories that you'll never hear about on ESPN, Ken Kaiser shows you the other side of baseball we rarely hear about. If you love baseball you will love this book."
3,"Some Recycled Stories, But a Fun Read","Ken Kaiser tells a great story and he and David Fisher deliver. However, if you have read any of Ron Luciano's books, you have heard about half the stories.Kaiser talks about some of his umpire partners, which I really enjoyed.Kaiser readily admits he is bitter about the way he lost his job in 1999 due to the failed labor negotiating strategy (a strategy Kaiser admits was a disaster). However, after the book was published, his case was settled in court and his now has retirement benefits.While I heard many of the stories in Kaiser's book, a baseball fan and a sports officiating fan will enjoy the book."
3,SOME GOOD AND SOME SAME OLD,"PLANET OF THE UMPS IS BY KEN KAISER FORMER MINOR AND MAJOR LEAGUE, WHO TELLS US SOME FUNNY AND INTERSTING STORIES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF THEM. I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR HIS MINOR LEAGUE STORIES BECAUSE I COULD NOT IDENTIFY WITH MANY OF THE PLAYERS. THE MAJOR LEAGUE TALES WERE MOSTLY GOOD AND SOMETIMES FUNNY. MR. KAISER ALSO GIVES US HIS OPINION ON THE TREATMENT OF UMPIRES, WAYS TO SPEED UP THE GAME AND SOME OTHERS. I DID FIND HIS SIDE OF THE UMPIRE'S STRIKE INTERESTING EVEN THOUGH I HAVE READ IT BEFORE. ALL IN ALL THIS IS NOT A BAD BOOK. THERE IS MORE GOOD THAN BAD. IF YOU LIKE BASEBALL AND WANT TO READ AN OK FILLER BOOK THEN THIS IS FOR YOU."
1,"Dull, boring book by a hypocrite","I found this to be a very dull book, very surprising because the subject matter is inherently interesting. Umpires must have all sorts of great stories, right?Very early in the book, Kaiser portrays himself as a big ignorant lunk, who stumbled into umpiring and finding his calling.Other reviewers have talked about his whining over being fired, absolutely right. He is also quite a hypocrite, trashing ballplayers and managers left and right, then using autographed baseballs to duck traffic tickets. He brags openly about making the rules, despite what management says. And while he makes a point about positioning, he neglects to point out the arrogance and stubbornness of many umpires were a detriment to the game.Lousy book."
3,Good stuff.. but a lot of it is already out there.,"If you have the late Ron Luciano's books (The Umpire Strikes Back"" and ""Strike Two"", you have a lot of the stories that former Major League umpire Ken Kaiser tells in this book. If you can't find Luciano's books (they are long since out of print), these stories are FUNNY and an insightful look into the world of an umpire. Argumentative, intimidating, and expressive is the man known as Ken Kaiser. He was one of the few umnpires to ever make the major league baseball players top 10 list of umpires.. at the same time he was on the BOTTOM 10 list of umpires!! I guess what I'm saying is, you'll either like it, or hate it. I liked it a lot, besides the repeated stories."
5,"Great book, great guy, great umpire","Let me start off by saying that you probably have to be a big fan of baseball and umpiring specifically to enjoy this book. With that said, its a wonderful book with a lot of funny stories and great insight into the life of an MLB umpire. Like another reviewer said, there is a lot of the same stories being told that were told in Luciano;s book as well as Durwood Merrill;s book....but there were also a lot of stories I had never heard that were very interesting. The ending of the book is rather sad though as we are told about the screwing Kaiser took along with many other umpires. Kaiser was done wrong and I hope 9 years after he wrote this book some good things have happened in his life. To wrap this up, I wish baseball still had the colorful umpires like Kaiser, it made the game more fun. Now we have a bunch of egomaniacs running around the field just daring someone to say something to them. Best of luck KAIS"
5,A Great Book About How Children Learn To Read,"This book looks beyond our old assumptions about how children learn to read. Moustafa presents research to support the fact that traditional phonics drills do not help children learn letter-sound correspondances. Rather, children naturally use onset and rime to make these correspondances. Children also use onset and rime to figure out unfamiliar words in a text. Moustafa then presents ways to help any reading teacher improve their reading instruction based on this research."
4,Good condition,The book arrived in excellent condition with no torn or missing pages. Ive searched for a copy of this book for a while & was very pleased to find one in such great shape
3,MacArthur's Escape,"MacArthur's Escape, by George W. Smith, is the story of General Douglas MacArthur's escape from Corregidor by PT boat. In my opinion the book does not break any new ground with respect to this episode. However, it still is exciting to read. The only shortcoming is the author's use of clichés throughout the book. Other than that, this book is a quick and interesting read and I recommend it to anyone interested in World War II."
5,MacArthur's Escape: Wild Man Bulkeley and the Rescue of an American Hero,"Excellent book so far. I haven't finished reading it yet, but looking forward to completing it. John Bulkley was my skipper from 1961 to 1964 so the information on his exploits have special meaning to me. He was quite a Navy man who cared about his men. Was highly respected by those who served under him."
4,Great History Lesson,"Having met Admiral Bulkely's widow, (now deceased), and having been a career Navy destroyerman, I really enjoyed the book. Additionally, USS BULKELY DDG84 was commissioned a few years ago."
5,Absolutely Gorgeous!,"Beautiful rings! Fast delivery, wonderful service, and exceptional quality! Just as pictured! Even better if purchased with: Heart Cut Peridot Pendant Necklace Sterling Silver like I did! Thanks!Heart Cut Peridot Pendant Necklace Sterling Silver"
3,Not quite good enough to buy twice.,"This is a good book, but not one of Jayne Ann Krentz's best. Also, it's not readily apparent that it is a reprint until you check out the copyright page. I bought it in 1988 and again under the new title unknowingly. I wish I had seen these comments first."
2,Not My Favorite,"I will say it up-front - Jayne Ann Krentz is one of my all-time favorite authors. Whenever I need a pick-me-up (and a laugh), I turn to one of her stories. So I was pretty dissapointed when I had an incredibly difficult time finishing this particular book. This is the first of her stories to put me to sleep. It was slow, the ghosts were sad, and the characters plodded. Just not one of her best efforts. However, it hasn't kept me from buying up her latest!"
4,Very Refreshing,"It was nice to see a romance that progressed past the initial ""I love you"" stage. Yes, they realized they loved each other but had to learn to live with each other. Both characters learn and grow. This was a very good book."
2,Falls Apart toward the End,"WINTER WAKE started off with five stars, and steadily lost them as the original solid story devolves into THE SHINING meets FATAL ATTRACTION with a sprinkling of Peter Straub's GHOST STORY.I got the impression that the author didn't really want to write a ghost story. The characters and setting are sharply drawn and in the beginning the book is compelling.Then we bring in the marauding rats. Finally there's a finale that's supposed to be surprising but simply piles one cliche on top of another.If the book were 150 pages shorter this might not be so bad. But as is it feels like a miniseries that makes a desperate attempt to fill out the hours to its alloted length."
2,Scholars Only!,"From the cover and the description, one would think that this is an excellent guide to the flora and fauna of Costa Rica. Unfortunately, it's a scholar's book only. While it has some pictures, there are none in color and those that are present are not that hot. High cost and lots of text, but not the kind of guide one wants when trying to identify flora or fauna seen on the ground. I sent it back in favor of more picturesque guides."
5,Central America Natural History Reference Book,"This book has detailed information about many of the plants and animals one might encounter in Central America. No color pictures, but many black and whites. Book is probably too large and heavy to carry in the field, but is exactly what I was looking for to learn new and obscure facts to impress the non-scientific fellow traveler. I'm very pleased with it."
5,Pinch of Salt Lake,"I thought I wouldn't be able to get a copy of this cookbook for my sister.Thank you! Since this cookbook is out of print, I was sure it would be impossible to find."
1,Give me a break!,"This book is a total waste of time - I reccomend you avoid it, and anything else written by this self-proclaimed ""Holy man"":""The founder, His Holiness the Dalai Seng Shih, developed Neo Ch'an Buddhism as a modern uncomplicated version of thought which does not rely on Buddha's teachings other than the desire for purity in mind and body. Neo Ch'an Buddhism, unlike its counterparts, accepts the referring to God, Father or Mother of Nature. Neo Ch'an thought has a great affinity to Judeo-Christian thought.""In reality, there is nothing even remotely related to Buddhism in this book. It is basically a lot of incoherent ranting about the views of his ""Neo Ch'an"" cult."
1,The Wrong Way,"Silly at best, exploitive at worst, this author has no Buddhist training to speak of and is currently in the midst of a scandal due to false claims about his history regarding Shaolin training, Black Belts, Secret Buddhist monasteries, etc., as well as shady business practises in his martial arts schools.There is nothing about Buddhism or Kung Fu in this book - in fact it has a decidedly Judeo-Christian slant to it. ""His Holiness the Dalai Sengshi"" should be avoided along with Jim and Tammy Bakker, Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the Hale-Bop crew, etc."
3,Old,This was an old edition and difficult to follow in the class I purchased it for. Next time I will know to look for the most currrent edition of the book I purchase.
2,"The sound quality is great, but...","The microphone is officially the worst microphone I have ever used. It's choppy, super quiet, and sounds like you're talking through the bottom of a wriggling pillow. I sell my voice for a living, so I've used quite a few mics over the years.I am very sad and a bit miffed about this purchase."
1,Junk Food Fantasy,"Well, the first 1/2 deserves the star, the second 1/2 deserves nothing at all (except another trip to the editors).This is trite junk-food fantasy. The characters are unimaginative, the names are worse. Those tambootie trees . . . I never could take then seriously.The plot is fairly cohesive for the first two thirds, but when the action picks up it falls apart. The special mysteries are also very obvious and not at all interesting. It takes all of three or four pages when the wolf shows up at the beginning to figure out why he's so special. But overall the plot drags.Just bland overall. Best thing about the book is the cover art."
5,Great for Dragon Lovers!,"Since everyone else seemed to be giving this book a not-so-good review, I thought it deserved some praise! I really enjoyed this series. I thought all of the characters had very distinct personalities and the dragons (especially in the last two or so books) are very neat and different from other dragons as one can see by the cover. Irene Radford's descriptions were extremely vivid, and I think she deserves more praise. As in most fantasy novels, you've got to read the whole series! Overall, I think this was an excellant little fantasy novel, especially if you love dragons."
2,Don't bother,"What first drew me to this book was, like most of the books I've read, the fantasy. I flipped through the first few pages in the bookstore and became intrigued enough to buy it. The characters seemed human enough and independent of one another.Until.As the story progresses, and the characters interact, they become more dependent on each other, not just in the relationship that characters have, but in their bases, their cores. They lost the potential I saw in the beginning, and everything became too cliche.I've only just recently exited junior high school, being a high school sophomore, and I have to agree with my dad in that this book feels like something written for grades seven and eight. It could have been a lot better; the names need revising, the writing needs to be consistent in style, the dialogue needs to be less cheesy. I'm not planning on picking up the next in this series, and that's something I don't often do."
3,"Not my favorite, but worth a look","I love dragons. That is what drew me to buy this book. The idea of the story is a really great one. I don't disagree with that.I just feel that the writing wasn't that fantastic. The characters are a little underdeveloped and they are too much alike.If I start reading a series, I usually buy all the books in it, but in this case I might make a trip to the library...."
2,The Glass Dragon,"Radford, unfortunately has a tendancy to jump all over the place. The charters are not really developed and there are consistancy problems with how magic works. You really get the feeling that Radford created the story as she went instead of planing things out. You also get the feeling that about 3/4rths into the book Radford was rushing to end the story. This book will probably be great for those who like the Ann McCaffery series."
2,"Very interesting at the beginning, but dwindled at the end","At the beginning of this book, I was very interested. I couldn't wait to figure out what happened, and some of the plot twists were interesting. But then it seemed that Radford got too interested in the little love story and not interested enough in the plot. The two male characters became less and less distinguishable as the story progressed and so did the way the magic worked. The book should have been under ""Romance"" not ""Fantacy/Sci-fi."""
4,see through the looking glass,"I enjoyed this novel. I love to read fantasy novels and when I purchased this novel I was unsure of what to expect. When I read the novel I was pleasantly surprised, it is the type of book that when you pick it up it is hard to put down. I read it in two day and by the time I finished I could hardly wait for the sequels. Granted, there are some flaws with the novel (some weak scenes etc.), however you do get flaws in just about anything; look past the flaws to the things that you enjoy and entertain you and you will be entertained. Besides why do we, the general masses, read? We read to be entertained, so read to be entertained, not to find the flaws.I had a hard time deciding which of the three novels I enjoyed more. My advice, just read it, you will be entertained."
4,It's good... until...,"Okay, I've read the histories first, so it's cool to know what the characters are talking about pertaining to historical events. So first off, I suggest you do that... Anyway, I'm not DONE with the book yet, got a lil' less than 1/4th to read, and so far I've really enjoyed it. I like the rules for magic and everything that the author sets for her world. The romance was really pulling me into it, until I crossed a questionable romance(?) scene... I'll leave you to read and decide, and I'm going to continue it hopes that the ending will make up for it."
2,mildly intresting,it was okay in the begining but it gets worse and worse as you go along. pretty cheesy ( especially the wanna-be romance parts). but not all of it was bad.
1,Maybe one star is too much,"This is with out a doubt the worst fantasy book I have ever read.The book is filled with colloquialisms, unimaginative, choppy scenes with little or no detail, unconnected events, and poor editing.Sort of like lets write a (very) low budget romance novel and throw a dragon in to make it a fantasy.Read only at your own risk of never reading another fantasy novel again."
2,skeet,"Rarely do I feel so strongly about a book that I want to throw it across the room. This was one. I haven't yet thrown it away or used it for firework starter, but I was terribly disappointed. Perhaps because this was her first book (?) I might try another more seasoned one by this author, but I found the character development awkward and the style of overshadowing with some mysterious italicised voice infuriating.Don't waste your time or money. There are good fantasy books out there, but this is not one of them."
3,Personalities need changes.. o-o,"I picked this book up at a used book store a while ago because it sounded interesting, a few days later I started it and was d one in three days. I enjoyed the book and its twists, but there were some things that I did not like.To start out I definitely did not like the names, though they fit the characters they just weren't names I liked, my least favorite being Jaylor. Also, the characters personalities were interesting at first, but as the book went on they made decisions and statements I couldn't relate to. My least favorite personality being Darville, he was too typical, and maybe he was supposed to be.. but he had a most unattractive personality in my eyes.The plot of the book and being left hanging are what makes me want to continue the series... I just recently bought ""The Perfect Princess"" and I hope its at least as good, if not better, but somehow I doubt that it will be. It seems to be almost entirely about Darville..."
2,Disappointed,This book is dull and dry as wood shavings. I hoped it would be cheap but it is not. It is amazing how someone can make an interesting discipline so boring. Reading it is a punishment. I can't imagine why anyone would want to read it.
5,Excellent Burner,"I had always wondered why plextors were so expensive and was sure I'd never get one though in my heart I lusted after a SATA burner. I was given this drive as a gift (well, I was given gift cards for Amazon). This is an incredible drive, quiet and quick with a good software package. I'm very impressed and cheap as I might be I have to admit this drive is well worth the price."
3,Solid pop tune with pleasant harmonies,"The second single to be released from the excellent 'Dance the Devil' album - not in the same league as the stupidly brillant 'God Bless Mom' but nonetheless posesses those trademark frames harmonies and is still way better than most of the stuff in the charts these days.The B-sides are in the same category - both decent pop workouts but neither match the strength of the B-Sides of the last singleSo in conclusion, not an essential purchase but one that's worth checking out if you're a fan. For the real deal, check out the wonderful 'I am the Magic Hand' EP - that's where it's really at"
2,No miracles here,"This hasn't made any difference in getting our 1-month-old to sleep. The material is very stretchy and he can get his feet out and his arms loosened readily. I'm probably not pulling it tight enough, but I hesitate to because it really seems like I'm incarcerating him."
1,Didn't Make Me A Better Web Searcher,"I bought this book reading the reviews on Amazon.com. When I got it, I was sorely disappointed. The author has a bit of an arrogance about her which comes through in the pages, which is fine, but then the book doesn't teach any good tricks...so the arrogance becomes a little annoying. To be honest, I thumbed through it four times after receiving it from Amazon and I didn't find any good info it (i.e. nothing about it really grabbed me) and I haven't looked at it since - so take my review for whats it worth. Ultimately, It did not help me in my goal: to be a better web searcher. My advice is to just look online for web search tricks. You'll find specifically what you are looking for and it will be free. The author promises a lot - but does not deliver."
3,De-Phazz - Days Of Twang,"De-Phazz's sixth album, DAYS OF TWANG, starts off promisingly, with the slide guitar of ""Twang"" -- country-western might be the new jazz! But it then quickly devolves with the wan disco of ""Boogie Philosophy."" The album vacillates between these two poles: from the dreaminess of ""Nonsensical Thing"" and ""Shadow of a Lie"" to the bland ""It Will Turn Out Right."" But things do perk up: ""Hell Alright"" has a pleasing anger to it, with a bit of swing that's been missing from his two previous albums, and Paul St. Hilare's appearance on ""Better World"" gives a nice contrast to De-Phazz's regular vocalists. The instrumentals do indeed lean heavily on the country side of the musical spectrum, but occasionally he can dull the interest (with the lame vocals on ""Rock'n'Roll Dude,"" for instance). But the crazed banjo on ""What's the Use Of...?"" shows how far he can push the idea and still have it work. Even the short ""Devil's Music #58 Reprise"" manages to recapture some of that De-Phazz magic."
4,Great ideas!,It has a lot of really nice things to see. It's quite hard to duplicate the things you see in the book but it gives you a lot of great ideas.
3,difficult to transform,"the kids love it but I'm a little ""transformer inept"" - have a hard time transforming them and the directions are not that clear"
5,Hot Rod looks great!,"This renditionof Hot Rod (also known as Rodimus) is one of the gems of the Transformers: Classics toyline.This toy is suprisingly solid in both forms and the attention to detail and quality is impressive. His car mode looks most like his G1 cartoon/movie version than any of the other Classics Transformers except perhaps Starscream.I especially like the way his gun turns into a jet engine (like the one on the Batmobile) for the rear of the car in car mode. One of the worst things about the original transformers was keeping track of their accessories, but with this latest line of toys the weapons are usually integrated into the vehicle mode somehow. This is one of the best examples of that integration.the only thing I could really find to nitpick about this toy is the lack of an Autobot symbol on the hood, but that isn't nearly enough to keep me from giving this toy 5 stars for its great transformation, solid feel and amazing poseability (especially compared to the original)"
3,review,I purchased this as a gift for my grandson. It was perfect. I was very pleased with the product.Thank you
2,"Good mouse, functional phone","As a wired mouse, the Mouse Talk performs admirably well, being small and thus comfortable portable while remaining easy to use. As a phone, it works but leaves a lot to be desired. The ""echo cancellation"" feature means that if the person on the other end of the line is using speakers instead of headphones, the conversation quickly degenerates to what would be held on a set of radios, since only one person can talk at a time.As a mouse, Mouse Talk is great.As a phone, Mouse Talk works, though it leaves much to be desired.As a result, Mouse Talk is probably not worth the price tag."
2,Don't Bother,"Received this with high expectations. Got it assembled, couldn't get it to stay in an upright position. Called techical support, waited on hold x20mins, then was told how to fix it. Hung up the phone, turned on the machine only to hear a horrific noise and no suction. I promptly disassembled it, and sent it back the next day. It was a waste of time and I had to pay for the return shipping. I was extremely disappointed!"
3,Hose is annoying to use - but great suction.,"The removable hose is difficult to get the hang of, and - no other way to say it - simply annoying. Can't deny the suction is great, but I also can't help but think the Dyson is overrated and overpriced."
2,Poor experience,The only reason I give this vacuum 2 rather then 1 stars is because of Amazon's good return policy. It did not pick up anything. The handle wouldn't stay upright. My 35 year old Kerby at least still cleans the house.
4,Dyson Vacuum Cleaner,"The suction on the Dyson is excellent. I've had a lot of difficulty trying to put the attachments on to the wand. The Dyson is very heavy.When all is said and done, I am happy that I purchased it. It was more affordable purchasing a re-conditioned Dyson."
3,Nice try on the pricing,I checked on Dyson's web page and the only list this model at $499 NOT $620. $269 for a used vaccum is not that great a deal ands its really only 46% off price of a new one.TimP.S. I have 2 dogs and would love to find a vacuum that worked great on pet hair.
4,Floor Vacume Great - Attachments & Wand Need Help,"Without question we are happy with the ability of this vacume to get a clean carpet. To be honest though, I am not ""elated"" with the attachments which don't seem to have a 100% dedicated fit. From that aspect it won't replace your grandmother's dedicated canister vacumes with rubber sleeves. The plastic interfaces seem to be outsourced from different companies as the plastics are of imperfect fit, many which do not ""snap"" into place but need to be muscled on and the plastics between the interfaces are clearly not from one manufacturer. Use of the wand seems somewhat counter-intuitive even after reading the instructions. We bought this at a discount and is the reason we are keeping it; largely for its ability to vacume better than any model in America."
5,Well worth the $$$,With 2 cats and 1 dog in our home - we have HAIR - LOTS and LOTS of hair. Within 5 minutes of unpacking - I was tackling the HAIR. WOW - amazed how much was picked up - and it seemed to take very little effort on my part to move this vacuum around. Best $$ spent - and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a vacuum that ACTUALLY WORKS!
5,Dyson Animal is all it says it is!,"I thought it might be hype, but I bought it anyway. Not the case! The thing, while strange looking, is well made and thought out. It is easy to use and works great. The cleaning power is what really surprised me. We have a dog and...well, the dog hair is no match for the Dyson Animal. It works great. You should not fear this purchase at all!"
4,Great product...Minor Complaints...,"We purchased this product because we were wanting a vacuum that could clean the stairs without lugging it up and down the stairs as you cleaned them. The hose attachment is great and DEFINITLY long enough. The suction is awesome. Easy to use.The only complaint I have is that it isn't easy to use the attachments when vacuuming. Meaning, if you see a spot that needs an attachment you have to shut the vacuum off and rearrange the vacuum in order to use the attachments. But other than that it is worth it. We bought this NEW on Amazon not refurbished."
1,Mercifully Short,"For themes which inherently inspire curiosity and mystery (time travel and the culture of ancient egypt) this book manages to be nothing but a dull and repetitive disappointment - despite its length. This book gets one star for its sheer brevity - the author thankfully subjects us to only 116 pages of pure emptiness. The characters are flat with the motivation of two year olds and the plot is rudiculous and almost non-existant. Add in a sprinkling of clumsy, misplaced sexuality and you've got a truly repulsive story on your hands. Do yourself a favor and skip this vapid tale."
3,nice present..,".. to a friend who is not entirely magickal neither orthodox christian (or whatever else) as partly joke, partly intro into magickal practice. I dont think it will help her with her spellcasting, but its tiny and sweet."
1,*BARF*,"This is sick! Authors think that they can just write up some fake spells (okay SOME of them may have worked 4 SOME if u) and think they deserve to be called the greatest author of the world, let me demenstrate "" I wrote a GREAT book, now i'm going to go be pampered. MWAHAHAHAHAH!!!"" they make us Wiccas sick!!"
3,This is why we homeschool,"I've put 5 kids through public school, and even those kids, now parents themselves, think this book is a bit over the top. I'd ask my 11 year old, but there's no way he'll be seeing it any time soon. This book is most appropriate for older kids, 9th grade and above. It's troubling that 12 year olds are quoted about issues such as ""making out"" and oral sex. It does contain some good advice about things like dealing with peers, dealing with sexual harrassment, handling the different school setting, and other things, but it isn't appropriate for middle schoolers, regardless of the title."
3,Dry,"I only bought this book because I'm in labor relations class. It's as dry as a piece of stale bread. But if you want to know anything and everything about Labor Relations and the history, BUY IT!"
1,No wonder I never heard of it,"This set of three French short films is allegedly based on the works of H P Lovecraft; he must be spinning in his grave. They are muddled, plotless, witless and pointless. Give this set a total miss if you enjoy Lovecraft."
1,Telecaster chrome switch cover,This product is cheap and thin. I was going to return but return costs $5.50! Bought another from GFS. Much better workmanship and grade metal.
2,Older program,"I did not look close enough to notice that this is not made for XP Computer, so I have not yet been able to get this to work on my WindowsXP system. If anyone knows how to make this work, please let me know. I finally did get another one to work because they made a special patch for XP and it does ok. thanks."
2,floam smells bad,"Very smelly stuff and very expensive for the amount you get. I am not sure I understand the appeal of floam. My 5 year old after seeing commercials for weeks finally got me at a weak moment. He is very underwhelmed by floam-he played with it for about 30 minutes and it has not been touched again. I do not recommend buying this. Incidently, later my husband found a recipe for floam on-line."
1,What a mess!,"I bought this for my four year old son and we couldn't get it to work. I read the instructions numerous times, but the floam just didn't stay together. It was a slimy, gooey mess no matter how long and hard we tried to knead it together. I was very disappointed because he had wanted it for a long time. When I finally caved in and bought it I realized it is a waste of money. Don't buy this."
2,Floam,"I got three tiny tubs, not the super-size advertised on TV.Gloppy, messy, and not enough to do much. I won't be getting more."
2,overated,"my seven year old HAD to have this expensive, smelly, gooey stuff and played with it once or twice and was not very impressed, it now sits on the shelf!"
5,WHAT A HIT- THE TOY OF THE YEAR,"This is the best product in years. It is so innovative and has tons of play-value. I bought this for my 6 year-old for his birthday and he just loved it. I ended up buying 3 more for some of my other kids, and it is there favorite toy. They have been having so much fun making crafts and they just play with it for hours. I have not seen this product stain anything, and I know that a couple of reviews say the product has a weird odor, but honestly, I don't think this product has a bad smell at all, and neither do the kids."
1,Nasty and Disappointing!,"This is more hype than function. If you get past the horrible smell, you will have to get over the cold, clammy texture. My 4 yr old daughter couldn't get past the smell and did not enjoy this nearly as much as Play-Doh. What a waste of money!"
3,"A good starter, now in need of update","A good coverage of what it means to be market focused. Does a decent deep dive on some topics. A great many books have now followed, making this coverage somewhat dated."
4,Loved it,"I first heard this CD at a prayer meeting when the leader played a track for us to meditate. I had to pay nearly as much again to get it shipped over to the UK, but when it arrived I loved it even more and ordered two more copies to give away."
5,"It works, if you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS....","This product is amazing and works well, but you have to follow the instructions to make that happen. I was a pock marked teen which led to my being a pock marked, scarred, adult. Until I found this product. Its easy to use and it works!"
2,Seemed to work for a bit,"This product seemed to work for a bit; but now, it does not feel like it was worth it at all. I have been using the product for at least 3 months and it did seem to fade scars at first but I have not noticed any significant changes and still have ugly, embarrassing spots that were not improved."
1,Hated It....,"This product did nothing for me. In fact, my skin was a bit worse while I was using it."
2,It's working but easily rotten (oxidized).,"I had some experience with this product. So I know it's working.At Amazon, I bought two boxes and found them rotten. They were brown and oily. They were supposed to be white and creamy. It was not the first to me (I had same experience with product from Walmart). I think 'Acne Free' should stop it's production before they solve this problem."
3,A good basic program,"This book has deficiencies such as the writing style. However, as a martial arts instructor, I can say that the actual training set presented in this book is quite good. The motions are taken from traditional kung fu, taiji and qigong and organized into a beginner's set. I would say this is a good start for people looking for a simple way to practice the fundamentals of taiji. However, if you really want to learn the nuances that really are impossible to learn from a book, then go to a teacher."
1,What happened to my review?,I have already written a review for this book. It is terrible. Why have the negative reviews of Olaf Simon's books been deleted?
5,Great Copy,In THE SNOWS OF KILMANJARO writer Gregory Peck reflects on the loves in his life as he lays waiting to die at the base of Kilimanjaro in this Hemingway story. The story juxtaposes his past live with his true Ava Gardner and the present with his wife Susan Hayward. THE SNOWS OF KILMANJARO has a very good Bernard Herrmann score. John DeCuir and Lyle R. Wheeler's Art Direction is exquisite and adds to the strange mystique of this film. Henry King's direction is rather ethereal.
3,Short Stories,"This is a book of short stories, a format I have never been particularly fond of. I personally use them to fill in the time between finishing one book and starting another and as medieval murder mystery stories are one of my favourites I was happy to acquire this one.There are thirteen short stories in this book by some of the best medieval mystery writers around at the moment, including Michael Jecks, Margaret Frazer, Peter Tremayne, Edward Marston and many others. So within the cover of one book we are re-introduced to such old favourites as Sister Fidelma, Cadfael and other characters from the pens of these authors."
2,Good dancing - -awful production!,"Let's count the ways in which this ballet has been savaged. 1) Poor choice of camera angles showing dancers from waist up or from pov where action is blocked. (2) Robotic, random cutting that has no relation to what is happening or what the viewer might want to see. (3) On stage narrator interfering with action and interrupting music and action with gratuitous comments on the story. (4) Music slowed down and dynamics crippled to accommodate meaningless choreography. Some nice dancing though! And the only version of this ballet you're ever likely to see! I watched this once, just to have seen it and keeping on my shelf as a reminder not to order again!"
5,Rachel Doing What She Does Best!,"This is the first single to be lifted off Rachel Stevens's 2nd album ""Come and Get It"". Negotiate with Love is a very fun, electro influenced pop track with graceful vocals. The love to infinity remix is a great + to this cd. Queen, the B-side to the single is a great song. Pure pop perfection. The single also includes a 6 minute interview answering her fan's questions. a great buy."
2,Bose CD changer,"I too bought both the Wave Radio and the Changer. Bose knows a lot about sound and the Wave Radio is terrific. They should never have tried to get into the changer business. I have had countless problems with CD getting caught in the changer, CDs that would not eject, and more. Sent it back for factory repair and it lasted a couple of weeks then the same problems. Not a chance in the world I will ever buy another changer from Bose. By comparison, I have also had a Sony system with a 50 CD carosel that has performed flawlessly for over 10+ years. Go figure."
2,Another one bites the dust,"I, apparently like many others, have a multi cd unit that no longer works. The CDs sound like they are scraping when they spin. It's less than two years old, but given the infrequent use, has maybe two months of play on it. Low quality unit. Bose, please spend less on marketing and more on quality control."
1,Junk,"I received the CD changer as a Christmas gift last year along with the Wave radio. The Bose Wave radio itself is fantastic and works very well. The CD changer is complete junk. We had it for 2 weeks and it stopped playing CD's. They would jam up and it took forever to get them back out. The changer is also very noisy. I've tried to contact Bose, but had no luck on getting a refund. I don't recommend the CD changer, but do the radio itself."
1,Save your money!,"When I encountered the Wave Radio the first time, the love affair began. I plunked down my hard earned money and took it home. I can't say enough about the rich tones this little box produces and its flawless performance. After a time, changing the CDs became a hassle so I looked into getting the additional CD changer. Given my satisfaction with previous Bose products I didn't hesitate to shell out the additional $250 bucks! Well, what a MISTAKE! It has NEVER functioned as it should and after REPEATED returns to Bose so they may ""repair"" it, I am still left with a broken accessory, not to mention, since it was out of warranty for the first repair, my wallet is a whole lot lighter! Buyers beware, I wouldn't recommend this albatross to anyone for anything other than a very expensive paper weight!"
3,"Great sound, mechanical noise when changing cd's","The Bose Wave system has great sound, but too much mechanical noise when switching cd's - I'm returning it for this reason."
3,Could be better,"My fiance and I received this item as a gift. We already own the Wave music system. As always the sound from Bose is exceptional. However, we are very dissapointed with the mechanical noise made by the cd changer. It also has trouble sometimes when trying to read MP3 or WMA cd's. Disappointing considering the cost of the item."
2,No shuffle between disks,"I will be returning my CD changer (while keeping the wave music system)The reason is that it does not have the capability to shuffle between disks. i.e. It will randomly play songs within one disk and then move to the next disk. It cannot play a song on one disk and then randomly switch to another disk.BTW, the reason these systems are expensive is that they are made in the USA. A great reason to buy BOSE."
1,Doesn't work!!!,"I bought both the basic 1-cd unit and the optional 3-cd unit. Discs kept getting stuck in the optional unit requiring re-loading the software to get those out. After 10 to 15 times of this waste of time and source of frustration, I put the thing in a drawer where it still is.This product has proven to be a complete waste of $250!!"
5,Works very well,"i have a 68lb 11 month old lab, we've been using this leash for about 3 moths now. We walk twice a day each time for about 45min. I bought this because the other two by different manufacturers, broke easily after only a month or two. My dog will occasionally make mad dashes, or need to be pulled in and this leash has stood up to all the test so far. I recommend."
2,Another tear in the leash,I love this product but am disapointed in the durability of the retractable web leash. It has already torn after less than a month. Very disapointing ...
2,Too long to ship out,Why is this item taking so long to ship out? Most items I have ordered in the past are shipped out the next day or two. I am on the verge of cancelling this item and going to my local store to make this purchase.
5,FINALLY,Finally a comfortable leash for my on the go active dogs. They are well made and easy on my hands even with the occasional 'excitement' on a dog walk!My dogs are 65 pounds each and still young and so far so good with the Flexi Soft Grip dog leashes. Worth the money...
3,The difference and why the Classic might suit you,"I bought a Flexi about ten years ago that I liked a lot - now referred to in label as the Classic Flexi. I didn't realize there was a difference between this product and that old one. Yes, this new Comfort Flexi feels nice in the hand but the big difference is in the size of the ""tape"". The Comfort's is quite thin! And I think more likely to cause accidental cuts and burns, and possibly even break.The Classic in my experience was almost twice as wide, which was super convenient during those random times when my dog's listening skills went out the window and I might have to reel my him in by hand. I wouldn't feel comfortable grabbing the Comfort's tape for fear of injury. If the Classic leash truly is the classic that I remember, I think you will feel more security in its bigger width."
4,Nice Saw,"I was thinking about buying a cheapo saw...a 40 dollar special at the Home Depot...but I decided this would probably last longer, and cut smoother. So far I haven't been dissapointed...It's a great saw, works wonders on anything and everything it goes through. I agree the blade it comes with is best left for framing, but it does seem to be a better blade than many that come with the saw...And it came with two of them, which was nice. One I try to keep nice, and the other I beat the snot out of. All in all, not a bad saw...Hopefully it will keep on going."
3,Don't drop this saw,"I have used porter cable saws for thirty years and this saw has been good until I dropped it and cracked the saw guard at the narrow, unreinforced point by the nozzle. It's junk now. I'm amazed that the engineers couldn't have realized this would happen. The saw is practically broken in half and won't cut a straight line for the life of it."
3,MINE BROKE,I DROPPED THE SAW AND THE MAGNESIUM CASE BROKE. IM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. ONLY 18 MONTHS OLD. IT WORKED GREAT TILL THEN.
5,Awesome Saw,"Flawless. All the power you would ever want in a circ saw, with barely half the weight of a worm drive. The cast magnesium base is rock solid, glides easily, and adjusts like a dream. Adjustable dust chute, comfortable grips, solid trigger.How much did this cost again? Can that really be the price?This saw takes on all comers.My shop is fast becoming the domain of Porter Cable, and it's because of tools like this. I have a vivid imagination, and I can't think of anything - anything at all - that could make this a better tool. Highly recommended!"
5,Awesome saw with all the power and features you want!,"I love this saw! I looked at the Bosch, Milkwaukee, Dewalt & Makita and settled on this one. It has the best balance of features, power and weight. You can discharge the dust or attach your shop vac to collect it. It's not perfect but it collects 80% of the sawdust, which is great if you have to use it indoors. I also like the tooless blade change and the heavy duty sole plate. A great tool with lots of power {whoa whoa}. I wish the carrying case had storage for a few spare blades but that's my only complaint.Toolman Joe"
4,"Great tool, but go back to a wrench for blade change","I have found this saw to be very dependable and comfortable for professional everyday use. The only problem is with the toolless quick-change blade system. This may be fine for homeowner use, but for a professional tool which I use every day, I would prefer the old-fashioned bolt and wrench."
3,okayish,"This outfit is really cute! The body is pretty narrow, and the length is a little short. Buy big if you choose to buy at all! The hat stands pretty tall, and looks a little goofy. Personally, I think there are a lot of cute Chiefs outfits out there, and I would pick a different one if I could redo it."
4,"Great message, good story","An airplane crashes and the few survivors question why they lived while others didn't. One man COULD have made it, but chose to save others instead. His sacrifice leads the others to take a hard look at the decisions they made (or avoided making) in their lives. Ultimately, the book's premise is that each of us has an impact on the lives around us."
2,Couldn't get past the dialog,"The story concept is really interesting. How do you recover and move on with your life after a dramatic event such as a plane crash. I was looking forward to reading this book. However, it was a difficult book to get through because of the dialog. People do not talk to each other the way they talked in this book. The lack of compassion and understanding across the board was so poor. As someone interested in screenwriting, it was really difficult to have the characters speak to each other so unbelievably. Ordinarily I would have closed the book and not finished it. But I did slog my way to the end. I guess that is a testament to Nancy Moser's story telling ability. She did come up with an interesting story. But she really needs to pay more attention to the words she has coming out of her character's mouths."
2,Pass on this one,"I was not really impressed by this book. The characters were not developed enough to really care about. The plot line seemed forced and some of the dialogue was not believable. At the risk of sounding like a complete idiot, I have to admit that at times as I was reading and a character was mentioned, I had to go back to remember what that person's particular situation was. It was like a bad made-for-TV movie. I would feel much safer in recommending Terry Blackstock's books instead."
3,too easy to hit the buttons by accident,"My almost 4 year old daughter is semi interested in this toy. We've had similar, like the leapfrog farm, letter and word whammers, so it was apparent how to use this. It is somewhat difficult for a toddler to get the food letter item into the fridge without bumping one of the three buttons above the space, and that screws up answering the question correctly and getting the desired praise. She seems a little confused when it does not respond as she expects it to. Making this about a third bigger would be desirable.She does play with it for about 10 min at a time several times a day."
3,2 year old not interested,"My (just turned) 2 year old son is not interested in this toy. He loved the Leap Frog Phonics with the alphabet; thus I thought he would really like this. He looked at it, listened, winced, and walked out of the room. The volume is loud and there is no volume control other than putting a piece of tape over the speaker. There are three different modes of play - which is probably a bit overwhelming for him (the Phonics game was basically a one trick, push the button toy - and more appropriate for his young age). I plan to remove it, store it, and hope that he likes it in six months to a year."
3,"2 weeks, Already Broken!",My son is a toddler. He loved this toy for the two weeks that it lasted. He pulled it off the fridge and it landed on the floor. Although no visible damage on the outside it won't work. Do you know any kid that doesn't drop their toys? They should've made it a lot more durable.
3,"fun, but wrong at times...","my son received this toy at 17 months...he loved his leap frog letter factory one, so we got him this, in hopes he would learn colors and foods. I think it is almost over-bearing with all that is going on in it. I dont think he really learns much from it, but i know he definatly likes to take the magnetic pieces out & put them back in. he also loves pressing the buttons. the educational value of this toy would have been higher, had the sounds to the letters been correct. Instead of saying F for fork, it will say something like R or S...its weird, and im not sure what went wrong in the reader, but it does not correctly state the colors, items, or letters. sometimes the E, Egg one will be in, and it will say that A is for apple... im like, but E is on the toy, not A. anyhow, enjoyable nonetheless. some may not approve, but as long as my son doesnt mind, i dont either."
2,Not great durability,The product does NOT stay on the frig. It slides down. Also the door is so hard to open my child has to ask me to open it and I can barely get it. The learning aspect is great but these other flaws are disturbing.
3,Cute but Aggrevating,"My 4 year old son got this as a Christmas gift. When he oppened it he asked ""Is this a Baby toy?"" He didn't think he was going to like it but when we got home and put it on the fridge he had fun answering the letter questions, he did very well. He decided it wasn't too much a baby toy.There are some drawbacks as others have mentioned...It is loud and sometimes it's hard to understand what letter they are saying such as V or B or E and my son will pick the wrong one. And also when he does select the correct letter it doesn't always give him the praise for being correct but describes the food and moves on to the next question leaving him wondering if he was right or not. That's when he gets aggrevated.Overall it was a gift and I think it's cute, I might feel differently if I had paid for it myself :-)and at least if he's bored while i'm making dinner he can keep busy in the kitchen with me at least for a couple of minutes."
3,Great toy but earlier reviews are right,"My son loves this toy but I think the reviews I read were right. It is annoying how the buttons above the magnet area change the game from letters, to colors, to foods very easily. There is also no way to shut the sound off or lower/raise it like you can on the leapfrog toy. It says the same thing over and over again with every magnet to the point that its loud and a bit grating. My son loves it, its just not one that the parents may love. I have all those leapfrog magnet toys (farm, alphabet) and I think they might be better quality and more enjoyable for parents as well as kids."
3,Aqua Bassino - Beat's N Bobs,"I have to admit that I was disappointed by this album. After 4 astounding EPs, Beat's N Bobs comes off as a watered-down: 2 tracks come directly from other EPs and at least 2 or 3 tracks are remakes (including ""Time..."", a vastly inferior downtempo version of ""As Time Flies""). The new material helps balance out the album (""Baby C'Mon"" is great, as is ""To Hard, Try & Find""), but I had really hoped for better."
3,Not what I expected.. But not bad,"It is an interesting movie I'd have to say.. But it doesn't talk primarily about the samurais of Japan. It talks more about the history of Japan, how it was introduced to Buddhism and Christianity afterwards; it also talks about its most famous surviving architecture. The movie doesn't quite hold its title; it should be called (the history of Japan) or something like that. So if you were like me, looking for more details about the samurais you will not find this one very informative in some sense."
2,Disappointing,"This documentary, was not very good. It mainly talks about the religion of Japan, so if that is what you interested in, then you may like it. But overall I was very unimpressed with it. Not worth buying in my opinion."
3,Cyanide Blues - Victim Five-O,"a few good bands on this CD. Two stand out, being Cyanide Blues and Victim Five-O (aka Shovel) Both bands practiced in the same studio and bring the true Vegas punk sound the CD tried to represent. Any punk who likes EP's, Singles or compilations should at least own this for the 4 songs between Cyanide Blues and Victim Five-o. Outside Looking In and Closure are two songs to definantly give a listen to."
2,an HONEST assessment,"I bought this book based upon the posted reviews. I have often wondered if the regular buying public actually contributed these or if the author or their friends wrote em to increase sales. I now know. Bar and Club design is a lot of sizzle and no steak. The photographs are nice if you are in to super slick Euro looking clubs where you can visually hear the techno trash music in the background. The pictures are amusing only because you look at them once and think why? I guess that is why they were selected for this book. There are no ideas anyone spending their own money would care to emulate; unless you are spending Euro's or Yen. I did not get even one idea from this book and I am an open minded guy looking for ideas. May I suggest 'Successful Restaurant Design' and 'Restaurants That Work.' Even though they say restaurant in the title they show many more pictorial ideas, floorplans and insight for bars than this disappointment."
2,Poorly Written and Researched,"I had high hopes for this novel. The premise is good and covers a time period, location and perspective that is not generally used. Unfortunately the authors writing style is annoying and the editing is worse. The characters are not particularly believable or likable. But what I found most irritating was in the details. He repeatedly refers to the Panzer that is the focus of the story as a Mark IV and as a Tiger. These are two very different vehicles. He also gets many other details wrong and even refers to the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines as an Island. For someone that supposedly has been a student of military history for 30 years he hasn't spent much time looking at the details of warfare in WWII. The author also needs to find a new editor.This book could be entertaining for someone not real familiar with WWII."
2,Nice design concept. But Performance trouble,"I used this mouse with my Sony Notebook especially for Skype communication. I could find this mouse has malfunctions. The first problem was that the external speaker (Microphone mode)of this mouse was not stable and not working after a few days using. But the phone mode is still working. I tried to find the reason through the program setting on my computer. But there was no problem and I could understand the hardware of this mouse itself has a performance or quality problem. And the other problem was that sometimes the cursor was just moved to upside, and it was difficult to find where is the cursor. When I purchased this, the price was very good. But I did not expect this situation. Even if I contact the seller with this issue to ask changing this to the new one after 2 weeks of my purchasing, there was no response. So I listed this issue on the claim list of Amazon.com. I am still waiting for the answer. I think already about one month has passed."
2,kungfu punch of death and legend of the eight samurai,"can't emember the other 2 movies on this, but the 2 i can are decent flicks. I got this at cd tradepost for 3.99, so don'y invest much so if you don't like it don't matter."
3,Outdated,Most of the content of this book is outdated. The content that it does provide is very lacking. I recommend looking elsewhere.
3,"Lovely grayish Bible, Great Seller, Small Print","This seller is amazing. This shipped the same day as I ordered it and arrived at my house a few short days later. The leather work on this bible is absolutely stunning and precise. The reason I'm giving this 3/5 stars is because the picture makes this bible look blue when it's actually more of an ash gray color. Also, I appreciate having such a compact Bible, however, the font is almost too small for me to easily read. You may have a different experience."
1,Couldn't find any bottles it fits,This is such a great idea ... but it doesn't fit water bottles or small Coke/7-up bottles. The folks at the bird feeder store thought it might fit some obscure brand of presweetened iced tea. I returned it. I wish I could get one made to fit bottles that I actually use.
3,Great Surprise for my little one.,"When my son was into Blues' Clues this was the best thing he could have received. Would not put down for a minute. Downside of the toy is that the spirals come outeasily, the crayon gets lost, and the pages can be hard to clean (they do not wipe down easily). I paid much less than it's being advertised for. Would pay the 49.99to see his face but not for the value. Not worth 49.99 but if you have a big time Blue's Clues fan he would love it. Shipped pretty quickly, felt a little slighted over the price but I understood I paid for a toy that was not going to last long."
4,Bues Clues Notebook,"the price is way to expensive for the notebook but it is the only one on the market and my grandson, who is autistic, loves Blues Clues.He sleeps with the notebook making it worth the price I paid."
1,Heavy sweet nauseating. yuck!,"I can't believe how many like it. My wife tried it in store and it seemed OK, so I bought it and now I don't know how to get rid of it. It turns my stomach inside out with the excessive sweetness. The worst of it? I was not aware that AMAZON DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS ON PERFUMES ""for safety reasons""."
5,Gift for Mom,I bought this last year for my Mom and when she went to replace she wouldn't pay the dept. store price! I found it a little cheaper on Amazon and ordered it for her again. You'd have thought I bought her a diamond! Her delight was worth every penny!
4,widescreen!!,"My thanks to ""calvinnme"" for all the technical specifics on the individual films. I find that sort of info very useful and appreciate it.The only thing left out was aspect ratio. I am pleased to be able to report that all are labeled as ""preserving the aspect ratio of [its] original theatrical exhibition."" That means 2.55:1 for both ""Hit the Deck"" and ""Kismet"" and 1.75:1 for ""Deep in My Heart."" I verified the three widescreen films on my computer monitor and actually measured them. The others, of course, produced before the advent of CinemaScope, Panavision, etc. in the early 50's, are all 4:3 or 1.33:1.I have a relatively new LCD TV and don't like to buy ""standard"" format DVDs if the movies were originally filmed in a wider format. I hate cropped films."
3,Classical Musicals Collection,"Apart from the exquisite Kismet, nearly all of these film musicals look very dated and a little boring in most cases.Although they seem to be sincerely produced and directed, many of them do not provide the quality entertainment that Hollywood is famous for - especially the later musicals, which were in colour and contained excellent choreography and well presented musical scores and singing.These musicals appeared before the American Film Musical Industry matured into world class entertainment."
4,Classic Musicals from the Dream Factory- Vol 3,"I was pleased with the service/dispatch of the above dvd boxset. Unfortunately, British Customs charged me 15 Duty on the goods because we in Britain are allowed only a limited value of goods( $45 ) free of Customs duty, and this box exceeded that value- not fault of the Sender though.I'm always worried when ordering goods from the USA because Customs here often charge duty-but that's a chance I have to take other than request the sender to declare somewhat less the real cost of the items being shipped to the UK. But full marks to the sender...and thanks."
4,if you like tacky old musicals,"Originally got this box set just for Kismet, mainly because it was so over the top and awful, but was rewarded with even more bad musicals - fun to skip through though, just to look at the musical numbers, be aghast at how unattractive Carmen Miranda really was (did she really keep her cocaine in her platform soles?)- marvel at really bad back projection and dreary dialogue and even worse plot lines....will treasure this box set for ever...would heartily reccomend this to everyone in the entire universe (especially if you slightly 'over-the-hill' and of a certain sexual persuasion like myself)."
4,spare and haunting,"Told in the sparest of prose, this dark coming of age novel recounts the loss of innocence of three teens on a posh summer resort island in the sixties. pulling away from the lighter activities of thier peers, the three create a private world fraught with social isolation and not so subtle sexual undertones. when a less sophisticated, kinder girl lonely for acceptence tries to penetrate the trio's barriers, tensions escalate with disturbing outcomes. the novel is brief but brutal, evoking the less idyllic flipside of the love generation. while it's detached and spartan prose may make it difficult for some to get involved in, Last Summer is makes for an interesting, ruthless glimpse into the perils of adolesence and the corrosive nature of peer pressure."
5,One of the best novels about adolescence ever written.,"I first read this book when I was a teenager, some twenty-five years ago, and have found myself coming back to it again and again over the years, particularly over the Summer. It was, and remains, stunningly and perceptively told and, speaking as one who grew up in that melieu, incredibly, almost frighteningly true."
4,Solid Story,A good read. I can understand why they made a film of this novel. It reads easily and has an impressive plot.
1,comment on davidson algebra,a cd rom with attractive cover but all lies about the content it is a small game with almost no content
4,Such a Simple beginning for a giant called SONY,"""Made in Japan"" gives us insight in to Japanese working ethos, their dedication and vision. It is a story of SONY, a company that is world leader in many electronic and IT products, told in simple manner by creator of SONY Mr Akio Morita. Coming from him, one has to believe every word of it. It is fascinating to read and travel along, as the story progress, with a small seedling's growth in to a big corporate giant that SONY today is. No brashness, no adoption of unfair means, no showing off its economic strength. It is a plain simple story of a dreamer who dared to dream and succeeded. An interesting reading."
2,this did not help me,"A receptionist at my dentist's office recommended this to me, as she heard me hacking away in the waiting room. I tried this for several days. It tastes okay, kind of like black licorice, but it did not help my cough at all. I had to get antibiotics."
5,Few better if you want clean and fresh; elevating!,"I've had this cologne for a while, and it is a great one. Fantastic for summer and day, or after a workout. This scent makes you feel good and energetic upon application. An exceptionally clean scent. This is powerful, and lasts and projects longer than many of it's genre, but I can't see it bugging people, as it has the ""elevating, happy"" quality. I wouldn't put too many sprays of it on, however, because a spray or two is about all you need.All in all, a highly recommended cologne I would (and likely will) buy again. I don't see this one disliked by anyone really, unless you have ""Axe bodyspray"" syndrome."
5,Very Nice Cologne!,"At least when I received this one, it was not damaged like the Prada cologne was. Like the smell very much!"
5,My favorite colonge,I love the light scent of this colonge and have gotten several compliments from strangers about it.
5,Romantic Suspense,"Another great story from Stella Cameron. This story has it all - a mystery to keep you guessing and a hot romance between the main characters who aren't sure if they should trust one another. Several attempts have been made on Sin's life and when a beautiful biographer shows up on his island, he can't decide whether it is safe to trust her. Angel has some ulterior motives for digging up information on Sin but is she wrong about what type of person he is? Sin and Angel must decide whether they should trust their feelings for one another, and hope they both survive the danger surrounding Sin to get that chance."
1,"Too, too silly!","No way could I sympathize, never mind identify with a supposedly professional woman whose first action upon arriving on a private island officially to interview a well-known millionaire, is to go swimming at night, at sea, stark naked! She should have drowned and saved us from reading misery. I don't much like Ms. Cameron's choppy writing style and the presence, in all the novels I've tried from this author, of the slut ""de service"" to provide an excuse for smutty, brutal sex scenes."
2,Not worth it,"The other customers are right. The cross is very small, and the chain is very delicate. I'm sure it costs $50 because it is white gold, but I'm not sure it's worth it. Plus, the diamond is not as nice as shown in the picture, and it comes in a velvet bag. It was completely tangled and took FOREVER to fix.Addition: I reported it to Amazon, and they sent me a new necklace that only had one small knot in it."
2,Crappy,"The other reviewer is right--this is very tiny cross and not close to the size advertised. But if you like delicate jewelry (I paid only $29) , it wasn't worth returning."
3,A good read but lacking data,"I quite enjoyed reading this publication; I found it to be informative and well thought out. But the text is very light on hard statistical data, relying more on broad generalisations through creative descriptions with little in the way of hard statistical data. If you are looking to read about the American army in World War II this is the book for you, but if your looking for a book with facts and figures such as notes on equipment, weapons, vehicles, etc - then this is not the book for you."
2,Forty needs the TM,"I greatly enjoyed Forty's work on the Japanese and was quite disapointed with this one. It would appear that Forty merely re-worded the U.S. Army Technical Manual on the Japanese Army and did not have such a source for the US Army. Coverage is pretty good on weapons. Fair on organization. Laughable on tactics. He fails to point out the major flaws with the US effort...shipping- limited organization, faulty tank doctrine, failure to effeciently use the negro portion of the population. This book at least puts a lot of information in one volume, but is not as good as his work with more easily found source material."
5,No excuses (any longer)!,"This book is a great reference to have on the shelf to spark one's creative juices or just to pickup and write something different than that three volume novel you've been sweating over for the last 10yrs.I liked the way Heffron organized the book.You could literally just open the book, find the word ""prompt"", read the instructions and write something. You can follow the way the author has it organized or be spontaneous.The book is geared more in my opinion to short-story/novel fiction writers than columnists or poets."
3,Not especially helpful for poets....,"I purchased this book after reading the many glowing 5-star reviews. As a poet, I was hoping for exercises that would ""warm me up"" by providing thematic ideas and/or specific forms for poems. However, in reading through the book at first I was confused; all of the exercises seemed to translate only into narrative prose forms (short stories, novels, memoirs, essays, etc.). A little over halfway through the book, Mr. Heffron actually states that he doesn't write poetry and has never really liked it! (mystery solved). I did read the rest of the book because, as other reviewers have pointed out, the author does have a warm voice and a helpful perspective on writing in general. However, it should be made clearer -- in the book description/jacket if not the reviews -- that the book does not usefully address poetry and the problems of poets."
5,More than Ideas,"Jack Heffron, in his genius, has simplified the writing process for professional writers and teachers as well as for writing initiates. However, this is more than just a book of tips and ideas. You will be inspired by the author's personal revelations and the writing prompts that lie within the book's covers.Aside from being a wonderful treat--or gift--for a writer at any level, if you need a creative jolt, then BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,HALLUCINATIONS,Buds genious has never previously been equaled by any other musician.Hats off to Claude.
5,Excellent CD of Paradise Lost,"The latest work of this english band. Its fantastic, the sound has slightly changed since the One Second-Album. Its still slow and gothic, moody-dark, but if you listen to it, earphones really loud and close your eyes - just listen and enjoy. I stumbled upon Paradise Lost when their album Draconian Times came out, while browsing CDs in a store. I listened to D.T. was taken from the first sound. Absolutely great. I have all of their albums, and since the beginning they changed style, refined and did really good work. I will buy the next album as well, without hesitating."
4,if they had added more guitar riffs...,"this is excellent music but i don't understand why having one of the greatest rhythm guitar player (aaron) and the greatest lead guitar player (gregor) they put a work based mostly on keyboards and samplers.if they had added more guitar riffs, this could deserved 5 stars."
1,9th Generation Copy Of Depeche Mode With Zero Personality,"I really don't give a damn about their sell-out. There are bands that have tried to appeal to bigger audiences without losing their touch. Sure, nothing surpasses ""Gothic"" and ""Shades Of God"" but everyone deserves to earn some money from what he's doing. That's not my problem.My problem is that Paradise Lost's ""Host"" is just plain bad. It will sound very original if you have lived in a closet for 15 years and just emerged out of it. If you don't belong to this category then just don't buy this piece of s**t.If I wanted to hear Depeche Mode, I'd put on their original masterpieces...This cd is extreamly insulting not only to Lost's fans (not that they care) but to any REAL music lover.Avoid at all costs."
1,Horrible way to progress,"This would be a great album if there was more variety in vocal use instead of constantly using a clean voice. I feel some guttural vocals emphasizes certain areas in the lyrics and song. Also the keyboards on this album is too amature like. It doesn't really give an atmospheric feeling as the keyboards done by Amorphis, Morgion, or My Dying Bride. Maybe they will learn a little more for the next album. If they truly want to go industrial doom then they should try experimenting with environmental sounds and intergrate those into the synth. Do some loops and stuff. What this album lacks is that someone just didn't sit down long enough to work on the synth layouts and song structure."
2,Statistical history - lacks feeling,"I was a student in the early 80's. In the latter years of the school the author does little more than ""echo"" the school newsletter ""Echoes"". If you're looking for physical history (i.e. - the cost of plant maitenance or the number of students attending in a given quarter) then it is an adequate reference."
5,Fantastic. Made in USA,Have used this Middle Buster for ditching and loosening soil. Also have used it for making mini ditches across a hard pack dirt road on a down hill slope to channel run off. Works very well. Have had good luck pulling up small to medium roots as well.Using this with a 23 hp Kubota.
2,Not user friendly...,"First off, the video just shows how the tricks are done - I would think that an instructor or coach would have been a good choice to add besides the player demonstrating.Secondly, for each trick you want to look at you have to select it from the menu... No option to just have the video play through. So each trick you then have to scan through the menu to the next trick you want to see then select play.Not a fan at all..."
5,Outstanding!!,This is the second DVD I have purchased from Proactive Soccer and Coach Paul Janaway. The latest product is a great teaching tool. It gives me an opportunity to have my players get more touches on the ball in a fun setting. The drills are challenging yet obtainable with a little practice. I found them just challenging enough that the boys will keep at it until they can master them. Well thought out!!
4,"Classic Slipcovers Printed Classic Stripe Canvas Pillow, Red",love the color & style and would recommend this product to other. the style is very nice and match the slipcover
1,All Wrong!,You really do get what you pay for. These pillows are very poorly made. The stripes don't even line up from front to back & I hate the material. Don't love'em.
5,NO MORE BROKEN PLASTIC CLAMPS!,"If you are looking to replace those broken and soon to break stock plastic T-clamps on your Roland V-Drum rack...this T-clamp is the perfect choice! This all metal T-clamp secures the tubes on the Roland MDS-8 V-Drum rack. Installation is faster than removing the stock plastic clamps (go find your 3/16"" allen wrench). The chrome metal wing nuts on the clamp are a breeze to loosen and tighten the clamp in place...no tools required thank you! When you complete installing these replacement clamps on the V-Drum rack, that's it. Solid, secure, and it is all metal which means it is forever. Gibralter has designed and manufactured a quality defect-free metal replacement clamp for the Roland V-Drum rack that works!"
2,El Destructo,"My parrot, Gonzo, really enjoyed this! (for all of the 20minutes it took him to cempletely destroy it)"
4,barely captures West Coast warehouse/underground vibe of the early 90s,"This was ""MY"" club that Jason Bentley,Urb magazine (Raymond Roker) and Doc Martin hi-jacked the name to sell this CD.I was only paid pennies for this release.This CD was to re-create the vibe that the club had; ie: Cafe Del Mar collections, Ibiza CDs etc.This CD "" URBmix Vol. 1: Flammable Liquid"" in my opinion; since it was my club, failed to create that.Yes, we only charge; at first $5 to get in but, later increased it to $10 to slow down attendance, which only worked for several weeks.I mainly created the club because I was tired to the wrong people=wrong mentality at clubs attending.It was widely known that a ""drag-queen"" could be seen dancing next to a home-boy with no one looking twice nor any one caring.Also, the ""tough guy"" mentality had to be avoided, that was found at mainstream/normal nightclubs :)"
4,As advertised,"Good battery life (certainly much better than the old one it replaced). For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original. However it doesn't fit quite as snugly in the dock-style charger that came with my phone (not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone, but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly). That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out -- if I'm not paying attention I'll wake up the next morning and my phone won't actually have been charged -- but it still works."
4,bargain,"I was astounded at the price listed for my camera battery, and relieved when I came across this economical substitute. It has worked well for me; retains charge, fits well in camera, saved me substantial dollars!"
2,No improvement,"This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced. When phone was new, battery life was good. Not sure what is the problem. Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. Vendor service was good. Or maybe just a bad battery."
3,Profoundly depressing,"I had high hopes for Love Junkie because My Search for Warren Harding by the same author is so funny, but I was sadly disappointed. I just can't seem to find the comedy in Love Junkie. How is it funny to create a pathetic, unattractive middle-aged woman and have a laugh at her expense? Most of the other characters are so unlikeable--Joel in particular--I just couldn't stand to read about them. And speaking of queens, Mimi herself is the queen of self-denial, but to the point that I was disgusted and not entertained. Meanspiritedness aside, the book reads like Robert Plunkett spent time collecting witty gay one-liners and stringing them into a story."
5,First Rate Piece of Musical Arcana. Buy It.,"'Lucenta Stella', performances by Pierre Hamon on recorders, with accompaniment, is substantially different than what one would think on first look at the cover art. You have to read the subtitling carefully to see that the CD includes both old music and modern works.I have always been especially fond of the recorder, as it is the one antique instrument I can actually play based on my experience with a clarinet, and this sampling really puts the icing on my cake.The overwhelming impression one gets from the collected works is that the early music was actually more complicated than modern, in that many modern pieces eschew common patterns of composition and go for very primitive sounds. One piece even sounds as if it were done on an Australian Diggerido. A quick check of the notes gives us no aboriginal musicians, so Monsieur Hamon and company must be doing a great job of simulating that great bamboo flute.A real treat."
1,Returned,The top of this table was fingered lumber. Fingered lumber is grooves or little fingers cut to be put together and then glued to make a larger piece. The problem here is while stained it still showed thru on the top of the table. Inside home products using this type of wood is not a terrible thing. This was just a poor job of inspection. I returned it.
5,An excellent reference,"A great introductory reference for the novice WAP developer - easy to read, cumulative skill development, comprehensive examples. Also a good introduction to .net programming."
4,Another MUST READ from this author,"Having read *Crash Course* by the same author, this one shows a whole different side to the Jewish world.Crash Course was about our history and the patterns that come up over the years.This book is about our influence and how so many things that we do now have been influenced by the Jews.From the Founding Fathers, to medieval England, it is just interesting to see where Jews touched and what were their impact to society economically, morally, and more.Some of the book overlaps with Crash Course, but that is just to remind the readers where we are coming from, and from there - you see the influence spreading throughout the land.LOVE the author as well. He has a way to make history enjoyable and does so in a story telling fashion that is inspiring and engaging."
5,Fascinating Exploration of Human History,"The story of the Jews, is the story of mankind. Spiro's exploration into the depths of history is fascinating, powerful and thought-provoking. What separates this historian's writing from most others is his humanistic view of history. It is both highly relevant to those interested in the modern world, and to anyone looking to understand how we got here.A poignant account of history which reads like a book."
5,Just Perfect,"A readable, flowing, coherent collection of history with observations which form what can only be described as a compelling and logical conclusion. An incredibly important work for our times."
3,Quality has slipped,"Although Scott Wipes have been a great product until the recent past, now quality has slipped. They shred easily now, and don't pop up from the box the way they used-to. Considering switching brands.CC"
4,Suffering,"This book is an amazing tragedy, about how the city took a family from the south, and literally destroyed them, from every angle imaginable (in spirit and in heart). Iceberg is able to capture the pain dramatically."
5,You will never forget it this book,"Its 2006 and I just suggested this book to someone because I can never forget this book. In fact, everyone that I have recommended this book to, still comes to me for book suggestions. However, anything that I've suggested doesn't compare to this page-turner. Let's just put it out there - its grimey, plain and simple. You keep reading because you can't actually believe this has happened to someone. When my bookclub read this book, one of the participants suggested we read a happier book next time. This book is not for someone looking for a ""happy"" book."
5,A wake up to reality...,"...of what black Americans have had to endure in this country. Coming from a white woman that has always had very close African American friends and family and never really understood the deep seeded hatred many black folks have toward their history with white folks.I was born in 1970 and always seen white/black as equal perhaps because I've always felt us as such. But this book really took me to a place where I could recognize the oppression of black folks and what a nightmare, hellish experience for so many in the early 1900's. Beck takes you right there.A very gritty, sad and tragic book but for some reason one of my favorites. I liked this one much more than Pimp. I'm looking forward to Trick Baby."
4,READ THIS AND LEARN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In this novel, Iceberg Slim takes the readers into the hearts and mind of a family torn apart by change. Otis the main character a homosexual young man stuggling with his ""new"" and ""past"" life, takes him on a whirlwind ride. Slim offers indepth insight on the struggle of the some homosexual men: the depression, isolation, the issues of trying to ""do what is right"", and the dangers of the lifestyle. Every turn is tragic in and of itself, but the book was honest and well thought out because there isn't a happy ending for everyone. Read this and learn from the characters mistakes."
4,First Famous Urban Author;'s Life,"I read this book years ago and just hd to have it. It's a great book about a young, black boy who is sexually abused by a church deacon and winds-up a gay man who's trying to find his way. Great book!"
5,"Bitingly observant school story, beautifully written","If you are used to school stories like Enid Blyton's and Elinor M Brent-Dyer's, you might find this a welcome change of pace. This painfully observant book about boarding school and the inner lives of young women is at times sarcastic, bitingly witty, thought-provoking, and touching.Nicola is one of my favorite girl protagonists; while I am certain I would have been scorned by her and the other self-assured Marlows, I love getting into their world and experiencing the embarrassingly realistic observations about the lives of girls and young women. Antonia Forest writes with such precision and skill that I find myself nodding in recognition of truths that I have never noticed before.This is the first book in the series, and The Marlows and the Traitors is next, in which the Marlow girls and their brothers have an adventure outside of the school setting."
5,Good value for the money,This is such an elegant perfume - it's not flowery and pretty - it's elegant and sexy - and the best value on the market. I buy $100 - perfumes - Lancome/Chanel -butthis is the best value for the money.
5,Very nice product,"These towlettes are just great. They're not as large as Scott's, but they do a nice job. These are great for little ones to get themselves clean, but they're also great for senior citizens as well. I've had no trouble flushing them so far, but in a newer house, hopefully that shouldn't be a problem. Highly recommend!"
4,Take me out to the friendly confines.,"Its sorta sounds like a George Carlin's bit on footbal and baseball. Major league teams are Giants; Then there's the various ""bird teams""; Cardinals, Orioles, Bluejays and other assorted beasts devil rays, Marlins, Tigers. Then you have your various uinventive sock name. And there that adopt the noble red man; the Indians. Then there's the nondescript teams; the Astros, Expos, Padres, Mariners. Ya know we are the Cubbies. Yes, a diminuative cuddly creature. We like it that way. And never let anyone tell you that there is a better ballpark the Wrigley field. You simply haven't seen baseball until you been at a day game at Wrigley. Sorry about the lights."
2,A Dangerous Game,"I have read several books in the Black Lace series, and I must admit that this was not one of the best. The plot was somewhat o.k. but the heroine lacked spirit. The situations left much to be desired. Characters could have been explored a little more and maybe even embellished. It was a bunch of uninteresting bad sex."
2,Not as described,"This karaoke disc does NOT contain graphics, despite the fact that the cover of the disc clearly states CD+G. The tracks are beautiful, but if you need or want the graphics, you're out of luck."
3,Catts family revisited,"Having already read My Brother Michael, I couldn't get into this rehash of the story from a different point of view. Plus, the voice didn't ring true for me; here was a 13 year old boy looking back on the past couple of years with the insight and maturity of an adult. For instance, To Kill A Mockingbird is told from a woman's point of view, Scout as an adult, looking at her childhood. Scout as a child could not have told that story. This story would have been better if Clay had been older when he's telling it."
4,"interesting title, interesting story","the title caught my attention in a used book store after I'd made my purchases, so I checked on Amazon when I got home and found it for a better price when I was ordering some ""new"" books for my 2 year old grandson. The story was reminiscent of my childhood in the south and brought a variety of emotions back to me while reading this book."
1,Rednecks writing about rednecks.,"Advice to author: Upgrade your education, take a literature course at a first rate university, like the University of Chicago. Then your ""intelligent"" characters will actually sound intelligent. For now, all your characters sound like rednecks, even the Gabrielle, who only in your fantasy was at ""Harvard"". In real life a brain like that doesn't get beyond some Florida college, where a real education is an impossibility."
5,The Presidents' First Ladies,"This is an intriguing look at some of the most powerful figures in our history, women who have often been ignored or written off as mere ""wives"" of presidents. In fact, they were confidants, consultants, co-presidents, and in some cases, in complete de facto control of the ship of state.Even the most obscure presidents often had potent partners, and the author's exhaustive research has brought them from the shadows of history into their rightful place of importance. They have been transformed from footnotes into living, breathing women who often had their own high ambitions.I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has the slightest interest in American history."
3,review of textbook used by my nephew to understand the subject in high school.,I had no difficulty locating this textbook which was ordered to help my nephew understand this subject for his studies in this high school year. The book arrived at the expected time with no damage to the textbook. My nephew has found it helpful in allowing him to do well in this subject in his high school studies.Thank you for your help.JMN
1,Stupid piece of crap,"This worthless program never even came close to working. It ruined 4 or 5 discs real well, but then one day, it decided to completely erase my hard drive.every document, every file.poof.STAY AWAY."
4,Good Review for AP World History,The film covers Indian history from the Indus Valley civilization (Harappa) through the Mughals. It hits all the major points needed for a good review of Indian history prior to the AP World History exam. It is also good for discussions on change-over-time in India. The film can also be shown in segments to reinforce instruction as you go along.
2,Lots of talk with overuse of Comp Grapichs,"The DVD's focus is on the northern half of Indian civilization and only mentions (5 seconds on a map) of the southern Indian civilization (Dravidian). At least it does cover Mohenjo-Daro the predecessor to the Indus Valley Civilization. Computer Graphics (CG) is well used with Mohenjo-Daro as the structures are mostly in ruins. However the CG is way over used with structures that are well intact such as the Taj-mahal, Making the documentary more of an illusion with lots of hurried talk. A far better DVD for the price is BBC - around the world in 80 days which spends a whole episode on India - Sri Lanka with actual footage."
4,Very informative and interesting!,"First off, let me say that the other review is a bit off-base. Although there might be some nudity involved it has much to do with their culture and it's not vulgar. Also it doesn't say it's meant for kids or for being used as a teaching aide. besides, the teacher should have watched it first to make sure it was suitable for children as with any program. It's a great DVD that is very informative and interesting. I learned quite a few things from this program and loved seeing Anicent India via this DVD. It's something that anyone who is interested in India or learning about amazing places should pick up. GOOD STUFF!"
1,Terrible movie for 6th Graders,"Ancient India: A Journey Back in Time (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World)I bought this movie to show to my 6th grade students as part of the CA curriculum. It was extremely dry, but worse, suddenly appeared explicit sexual footage which led to parent uproars as students reported at home. Even though the scenes were high relief sculpture on an ancient building, they were totally inappropriate for students ... or adults who try to follow Gandhi's adage: ""I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet."""
4,India doc is good for what little time it has,"Watched this film twice. Enjoyed.Naturally in a mere hour this documentary could not cover such an extensive history.The six part THE STORY OF INDIA is far better but also has six hours to do it's job.Lots of art, architecture, photos to show the history. This is lacking in much of the southern history of the country.Others have complained of the sexual stone reliefs shown briefly during the film. Americans really need to get over their sex negativity. If people hate sex so much they need to become hermits. It's a major part of history and daily life and can't be ignored. And it was a brief part of the film.This was a decent film though i still recommend THE STORY OF INDIA 6 part series more."
1,Not to jump on the bandwagon but . . .,"This game is really bad. Rosters look like they made no attempt to get them right and they are stil yet to release a downloadable update. Unlike other games, I cannot figure out a way to just go through the rosters and fix them myself.The instruction manual leaves much to be desired as I am yet to figure out how exactly I am supposed to pitch.I have not had the freezing problems other people have mentioned, but that may be because I haven't played the game much due to the frustrating roster problems (Sox with roughly half of the players missing or wrong).Save your money and do not encourage this."
2,not fun,"very simply- if you liked and loved played MVP Baseball 2005, you will not like this game. The games play totally different and it sucks that EA won't be able to make another MVP game."
1,Poorly Written,"I have to admit that there is some elegance to the statistical aspect of the game, but that is it! First, the commentary is always inaccurate. Second, saving and loading (profiles, settings, season, etc.) is cumbersome. Third, the game is flakey; you can tell they rushed this out the door without doing any QA. Save your money and play previous versions until 2007."
1,"I agree, BRING BACK MVP","pretty much everything about this game (except maybe the multiple user controlled teams in gm, franchise and season modes) sucks. if you liked mvp 05, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I cant believe we have to deal with this for the next few years."
2,EA - Please get your MLB License back!!!,"I want my MVP Baseball 2006. This is a poor substitute. The graphics are poor, the announcing is off the mark, and there are glitches galore."
1,I don't know.,"I was psyched to get this until the bad reviews. I too love MVP, and you know what? I'm still using MVP 2005 - just keep adjusting teams & rosters, create players, & update everything to 2006, and you don't need to buy anything else."
4,fast shipped,"I recieved this item fast. So far my husband hasn't try it but it looks nice, happy with quick shipment"
5,Bought for daughter,Daughter requested infant steth as she could not hear the smaller animals with a regular one. Arrived timely with books ordered.
1,the spring is so tight that is hurts my head and ears & the sensors don't work very well,This was a VERY expensive item and it doesn't work very well at all. Sometimes the sensors will pick up a heart beat and then just stop. Plus it is so tight that it hurts my head and ears to use it.
3,light,"These cups look lovely. Waechtersbach is a good brand, I love their stuff.However...I personally don't like light cups that don't keep beverages temperature well. I prefer mugs. Furthermore, they are not stackable.There were part of a set, otherwise I would have bought the mugs."
2,*not* a fountain pen ink,"Two of the missing stars are only for the false labelling: the box/bottle and Higgins' own website say this is an ink suitable for fountain pens. It is, however, a pigment-based ink (bits of suspended particulate matter) rather than a dye (dissolved compounds). Pigments will clog nibs; dip pens can be easily cleaned, but the nibs on fountain pens are more difficult to rid of these tiny clogs. For fountain pens, stick to those inks made just for fountain pens.As for the ink itself: it's quite dark, though not completely midnight pitch black. Feathering is minimal but not totally absent. Used in the correct pen or brush, definitely a good buy for the price; absolutely use it as a normal day-to-day ink... just not in a fountain pen."
2,Author knows nothing about military equipment or operations.,"Ian Slaters book is a good read if you do not mind the military inaccuracys. C130s that, when I was jumping out of them, shoehorned in 65 paratroopers in his book hold 220! The typos, periods in the middle of sentences etc are also disturbing. The cover says ""Superior to the Tom Clancy genre"", I think not. Clancy is so acccurate it calls into question security clearances, Ian Slater has not done his homework. This could have been a good read if he had done his homework. If you know nothing about the military you might enjoy it."
4,warshot,haven't read it yet based on mr slater's series am sure it will be another good book i always look forward to each of his books
3,inaccurate but I still keep reading on,"Slater's books, while they improve through the series it seems, are plagued but inaccurate statements. I wish he used a military advisor. Also the timelines in the books seem off. However, the stories are good and I do seem to keep coming back to the series after my frustration wears off because the stories themselves are good."
2,A bit foreign for US cooks,"I was looking for a general guide to some easy, quick microwave recipes. What I got was a book that is a bit more European than I can use. The recipes are not geared toward an American palate. Some would see this as an advantage, but I didn't find it ""the only"" microwave book I'd ever need. It calls for obscure(to me anyway)ingredients, many I don't recognise. I think of myself as a somewhat adventurous cook but most of these recipes do not appeal to me at all. A waste of my money."
2,Not for modern microwaves,"This book was a great disappointment. First of all, it is written by a British author and calls for many ingredients and has many recipes that are not well suited for the American kitchen. But most important, it is written using 750 watt ovens as the standard. This is such an old standard. I installed a microwave in October and it is 1200 watts. What a difference that makes. I thought the book was recently published, but it turned out that it was really older than I thought, as the paperback edition publishing date Amazon provides is misleading.What I don't understand is why there are no recent cookbooks for the microwave. Every book I've perused seems to be more than 10 years old. You'd think someone would write an up-to-date book as a comprehensive guide to the many things you can cook in a microwave (believe me, I've experimented since I got mine). But that doesn't seem to be the case."
5,Very Entertaining and Delightful to Read,I enjoyed reading Chocolate and Fireflies so much that I have sent the book to 10 of my friends already. The stories of Suzanne's chenanigans is great fun to read. Each chapter has amazing recipes that connect you with her stories and make you feel right at home with her. I have never read a book before that had a music cd attached with music matching the mood of the chapters. What a novel idea.A must read!
5,"life, love, and the pursuit of chocolate","Suzanne Locklear's book is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly stale literary environment. She shares the story of her life, her loves, her struggles, and her triumphs in an engaging and very personal way. The music which accompanies the book is an added treat. I ordered 25 copies and gave them out as Christmas presents. Reports are beginning to come in that they were much appreciated.It sounds like she had a family, like all of us, with both strengths and limitations. I appreciated how she presented the importance of supportive sibling relationships. The relationships we have with our brothers and sisters are often the longest relationships we will ever have in our lives.I can't wait for the second volume and the rest of the story.Dr. Ray E. Liles,Crestline, CA"
5,Must Read For Investment Professionals!,"A fascinating insight into the differences in values, culture and leadership between good (or ""stagnant"") firms and great ones. Jim and his team have a wealth of experiences and facts to draw on to support their thesis.I would consider this almost a manual for individuals looking to lead their firms down the road into becoming a great investment organization. It also contains practical insight into how values, culture and leadership are also essential qualitative research elements for consultants and analysts."
2,Below Average,"Order was received on time and in the condition desribed by the seller. However, the book bounced back and forth between the 'art' of leadership and the 'skill' of investing without really linking the two together."
1,Right Wing Screed - Supported by Money,"Beware of this book - it is strongly supported by right-wing Clinton haters - currently this book is being mailed for free to public libraries (public library director myself) in the same fashion as Scientology's anti-psychiatry screeds and Christian missionary materials. One certainly questions the validity of the information if the only way to get it into public libraries is to mail it for free.As is usual with materials like this, source references are not used. A good subject for the trash bin. Unbiased reporting this is NOT."
1,Seek therapy - not revenge,"More patholgoical Clinton hatred from a rabid right wing that just can't seem to stop itself. While there is plenty of Clinton scandal mongering to go around (and around and around and around) this book is neither an interesting nor a compelling example of it. Save your money, there's better anti Clinton tomes out there...and some of them might even be true...."
5,Great Gloves,Shipped fast; Received in good condition; very nice gloves! Better than expected. I highly recommend this company.
2,Too Basic,This book is not the in depth resource that it claims to be. Salmon and Johnson's Steel Structures book does a better job teaching connection design.
2,This is an example book.,"If you have some basic knowledge of LRFD design and connection. This would be an OK book. It contains so many example in many load cases and connection type. All of them are hot rolled steel or high force connection. In example it dose not tell how to retrive this equation, reference to variables, and how to use this equation.. you only have to guess. If you guess right, then it can be applicable to real construction."
2,Review is just review,"I am a civil engineer. I have been studying and designing steel structures for years. In Vietnam, this type of structure is not popular, and nobody knows how to make it good, make it beautiful.The only thing I really want right now is to be the one of the best in area of designing steel structure.So, this book may bring me some good knowledge, some new idea. That's all. I do want more information, like a sample of pages, picture, drawings, what can be included in this bookAnd at the end, I am so sorry about my English. I am not good enough in English."
1,Very poor information,"This book is really bad, all this information is found free everywhere in the Internet, nothing practical.The author justs tries to earn a living."
4,Excellent guide,"I have got my canadian permanent resident visa and I am searching for informations of Canada.Well, this book helped me a lot with good suggestions, tools, info etc.I will recommend it to anybody is going to move to Canada.If you want more immigration infos you should buy other books since this one is for people who already have the visa."
1,misleading,"My Dutch partner is hoping to move to Canada with me in the future and we both thought it was a good idea to find more about emmigration. However I found this book had nothing to do with getting there as the synopsis suggested, but more to do with the ""Canadian"" way of life, culture and customs. And even these should be taken with a ""grain of salt"". This book is not what the title suggests and I highly reccomend looking on the net for more valid and up-to-date information."
2,Living and Working in Canada,"While this book had some good information, it just sort of lumps it all together. The cartoons look as if they were taken from a 1981 ""Mother Earth News."" Some needed information was not included. There was nothing mentioned about working for an American or French employeer in Canada. And there was very little information about working in Quebec: just passing references about it being ""different"" than the rest of Canada."
1,not worth your time or money,"I'd give this book a ""0"" if I could. There is a shameful lack of specific information in this book. The author speaks only of Canada in general, rather than by province. This is the first review I have written because I feel compelled to tell people not to waste one cent or one minute on this book!"
3,Ok filter,"The product has a long life only if you keep it in use. So keep the water reservoir full. If the unit runs out of water and the product drys out then its lifespan dramatically shortens. By shortens, once it dries out it seems to become very susceptible to mold and/or fungus growth. The product is made with a protective coating to prevent this but it must become damaged when the filter dries out."
2,What a waste.,"I bought this along with several others for a batchelor party. Nothing original here, just more of the same. The camera work is about the sloppiest I've ever seen, for what they are trying to convey. These are rank amateur film makers, that live up to it. If you are a fan of this stuff, by all means. knowyourself out. As for others, don't bother."
1,suck,"this, like all the other GGW videos, is too much garbage and not enough real contentThis review may only be legally shown directly on Amazon.com"
3,"I agree, strange set list","Travis Tritt is a talented performer, no question. But after opening with a few rockin tunes, he goes into an hour of Travis Unplugged which has its moments. It ends with 2 more upbeat tunes, the finale a bit overly long only to be subdued by a break into Bible Belt (in case you didn't recognize it) which Tritt never sings. He just shakes hands and walks off the stage. Very odd. He sounds good, this DVD is FAR better than the horribly recorded MTV like concert footage. But unless you are a dieahard Tritt fan and enjoy being subdued for a while, I'm a little surprised by the set list, the only reason for my a little above average rating. In addition, the mix is bad. It's almost impossible to hear the keyboards and you lose a lot of the separation of the instruments. In addition, there's too much of a lovefest with Tritt and not enough shots of the band having fun, with the exception of needless shots on the side of the drummer when doing fills."
3,"Good, but could have been much better","Travis Tritt is one of the best country artists of today. His voice sounds great on this DVD and the performance and picture quality is excellent. However, this DVD kind of leaves something to be desired. The main problem is the set list that Travis plays; I don't know about everyone else, but I wanted to see him rockin' on that stage. But he doesn't really start playing any rockin' songs until the last 3 or 4. So almost the whole concert is the slower softer songs, which are good, but I just don't think it's a good idea to play that many in a row. They kind of started to put me to sleep after awhile.Don't mean to sound negative, I was just hoping to hear Travis rock much more than he did on this DVD."
3,an OK camera,"i bought this camera from here about a year ago... its OK. the screen is kinda small(1.5in), but at least it takes video and still pics. another thing is that it only has two mega pixels! well... ya... as i said before ... its an OK camera"
2,my review,"After having driven to 3 different Target stores in the Minneapolis area, I will save you all a bunch of time. This camera is available online only."
4,Uncompromised Electronic Dance,"In ""Far In,"" a melange of electronic music and brittish island reggae come together to form a notoriously cool sounding album. Some songs could be perfect for a party, others for a movie, but almost all of them perfect for fun.This cd sounds like ""Wink meets a caribbean brass band in the midst of an england house party whlist a raggae singer performs.""One of the best tracks in the album is ""At Aunti Tom's."" Its fun, catchy and makes you want to shake it all night long.At time this cd can get rather tedious, or a bit obnoxious if you are in the wrong mood, but if what you are looking for is a good time, and you are a listener of electronic, then this cd is for you. But be warned, heavy reggae influence can get vocals sounding a little similar most times. Arrangement wise, and in composition, i must say Townshend is a very talented artist.All in all, this is a good cd... and very FUN!"
5,Gotta Have this! Great Christian Techno/Dance,"I am the featured female singer on the SYCO ""KOMMAND"" CD...Darby Byrum. I lost my only copies of this CD when my moving van was stolen with everything I owned on it, in 1996 while moving to Nashville! Then E-beat/Essential Records went under, making it difficult to get a copy of it. It is so cool to see it is still out there, being enjoyed and listened to, as the musicians & producers who created it and play all over this CD are the BEST around,using an ""ALIAS"" to keep there names a secret. Hmmm who could they be? I'll never tell...well,maybe. DarbyDarlin@aol.com"
5,billboard the 70's,"It was ordered for my mother-n-law Birthday, she loves the music. It was received in great condition and was here within 2 weeks."
4,Great Collection of '70s Hits,"A nice addition to my song library, and a fun, nostalgic trip back in time! I had forgotten about a few of these songs, but find myself humming the tunes long after they stop playing."
5,70's music,I am enjoying the music on this CD. I play it all the time. Anyone that likes music from this era will enjoy listening to thisCD. I recommend getting it from Amazon.
3,Good 70's CD,"This is a good CD, but I realized once I started listening to it, that I really wasn't that into it, though all the songs are good and a good representation of the era (for that type of music). Good enough for a 70's party"
4,Good music from the 70's,"I have really enjoyed this collection of music from the 70's. I met my wife in the early 70's and quite a few of these tunes bring back great memories. My wife is still with me and she like the music, too!"
5,A must for every parent or grandparent... kids love it!!!,"This is such a clever program for having the insight to make learning manners FUN for kids. The gimmick of using the adults as the ""bad examples"" is quite funny and really hits home for the kids when they see the absurdity of bad behavior in a variety of settings. I showed this to four tough neighbor kids (all about 12-years old), and they loved it, all wanting their own copies! The next day, I saw two of them cleaning up a knocked-over trash can... which is a 180-degree change in prior behavior! Is Mind Your Manners to credit for turning rough kids into little angels? That's my theory! Check it out!"
2,didn't like the attitude,"I didn't watch the whole thing. In the table manners section I didn't like the suggested attitude - feeling superior to those who lack manners, looking for mistakes other might make and discussing them very negatively. Even though it's done for the sake of learning, I wouldn't want my children to adopt this attitude. This by itself is not good manners."
4,"Bit cheesey, but the kids got a good laugh","This is a bit over the top, but my kids giggled during the whole thing. It does have some good lessons. At least the kids are entertained while learning some good social etiquette."
3,Could be much better,"When I first got this tablet, it was hard to install and took a very long time to figure out how to use. It took me a few weeks to be able to operate the pen smoothly, and after a few months it became less sensitive and constantly stopped working all together. It's an okay tablet if you don't want to spend a fortune and aren't using it for anything important, but if you can help it, try buying a different one."
3,Not bad. I'm enjoying what I do with it.,"I am not a professional and I bought this device so I could draw with out using the mouse. I can draw a lot better using this device then I can by clicking and holding a mouse button down simply because the shape feels like a pen.The wireless pen can be extremely sensitive and I don't even bother with the wireless mouse that came with it. The pen works great in adobe photoshop but I have not worked at getting the pressure sensitivity to work. Oh well. Not a great mouse device, makes drawing easier."
1,You shouldn't need batteries!,This is the first tablet I've seen that actually requires batteries. My old Wacom that I've had for 8(?) years works fine without the need for batteries for the pen or the mouse.
1,Piece of junk,The driver that comes with it is old.The device was not recognized on the computer.No new driver is available.Don't waste your time with this piece of junk
3,Good pad. Good deal.,"This tablet is pretty good (my first one). I suppose you have to fiddle with it to get it perfectly smooth and whatnot. The mouse it neat, but be aware that you have to use it on the pad. The batteries for the pen and the mouse just died after working for several months. Not bad. I think it's a good pad for a good deal."
2,Frustrating,"This tablet worked marginally well for the first couple months, though sometimes it would just stop working and I would have to unplug it and plug it back in, not a big deal.Now it will only work in 30 second spurts and then take 5 minutes before it will start working again for another 30 seconds.If you plan to use this tablet for anything beyond signing your name, save your money for one that works."
1,BUYER BEWARE THIS SCAM,The Adesso tablet requirements say Mac OSX but the one I just bought for my daughter only works with a FOUR YEAR OLD operating system - OS9.The fine print in the manual (after you bought the thing) says check the site for new driver info. When you go to the site it tells you FILE NOT FOUND.Beware this SCAM!
3,"Addeso 6400 - Ok, flakey software","Well, The unit matches up to expectations once you get by startup issues. The software is a bit flakey, and the manual provides no help at all. The online FAQ provides some help, but again limited. I am still waiting for a response to my question to tech support, but figured out a workaround on my own. Seems you have to store the pen and the mouse off the top of the tablet when not in use or it will go stupid and not function after the computer goes into standby. The mouse is decent, but lacks the control one is accustomed to compaired even to a $15 cordless mouse. The pen works well, and the support in drawing software makes up for any lackings the product has. Overall, a good buy, just be aware of the support isssues and the software issues, oh and the mouse does NOT have a scroller wheel as listed in the description"
1,Stay away unless you LIKE being frustrated.,"Very unimpressed. The mouse jumps with every click and results in many miss-clicks when trying to select screen items or menu options, the mouse functionality is unacceptable. The pen on the other hand works well. I had to plug my old mouse back in to use in place of the poor quality wireless mouse that comes with the product."
1,Junk,"After reading the reviews, I realized there were varied results from those who had purchased the Adesso Cyber-tablet 6400. Since my daughter was going to use the pen and tablet in MS Paint, I thought it should work fine. Was I wrong! The wireless mouse was irratic and the the pen worked about 50% of the time. When the pen did work, it responded well after her mation started. Our computer is an average P-III Dell with plenty of memory. For the price, I expeced more.Adesso, find a another line of work!Shopper, buy another product."
3,It's my first tablet.,"I just bought this and had a few problems with it. It doesn't work for a period of time but it's a good tablet to start with. I do webcomics online and it's very efficient when buying it with Manga Studio Debut 3.0. If you want something smoother and easier to use, I suggest you buy one that's more expensive but as I said above, it is good to start with as it does not raise your expectations in your next tablet(s)."
4,"Lever 2000 wipes, take a hike!","These wipes are exactly what you need. Ever since Lever 2000 wipes have become more rare than strangelets, I've been looking for a new brand. Low and behold, I find Kleenex Splash 'n Go wipes! Hooray! Now, if my hands or face feel the slightest bit dirty, I can quickly clean it off. Don't get any of the moistness in your eye, though. It stings like the dickens. A big plus for me was also the fact that wipes smell exactly like this lotion my girlfriend always wears, so, I get the pleasent and comforting sense that she is always around. Mmmm... These are top notch wipes, friends! My only problem with them is that they are difficult to get out of the bag. They don't have a real edge, so, you may spend as much as forty-five whole seconds on just removing a wipe. Other than that, these are great. Thank Kleenex!"
5,Awesome product!,"Now, why on earth did it take 10,000 years to invent something like this? These towelettes are just awesome! They're great in the car for little ones when you need a quick clean up and they don't stink to high heaven like those other ""wet ones"" do that have been around for years. If you get carsick, just the smell of those things in the summer is enough to nauseate you. These, however, have no scent whatsoever - just like using water. We use these all the time and I just cannot recommend them enough. Thanks for the invention!"
3,Item shipped isn't what's pictured - refills only,"I like these wipes the best for carrying in the car and I can no longer find them at stores, or online. When I saw these on Amazon I was very pleased. What I received though was not what is pictured - blue bag with hard green plastic cover. What I got was refills for the pictured package. this is a bit misleading. This packaging isn't easy to refill since the hard green cover makes it difficult to stuff the wipes inside. I much prefer this style packaging (plastic cover over the sheets) is because it's much better at protecting the inner sheets from drying out. The packages with the peel back cover are useless. I also didn't want the tall tubes of wipes since they don't fit as nicely in my car between the seats.I was able to partially fill the one package I still had so it will work, but it's not what I was hoping for. It always happens - you find a great product with the perfect packaging and they stop making it."
4,Chi Kung - KiKo,"I found this book by searching information about Kenichi Sawai, the master who brought the Taikiken to Japan, after learning it in China with the creator of the Yi Chuan style of Kung Fu. The essence of Taikiken is the same as Yi Chuan (I quan), the main development of Chi by the standing meditation (Ritsu Zen or Zhan Zhuang), and his further use in health as well as in combat.Yayama's explanations are really good, I recomend this book for those who want to discover the inner energy in them, but a lot of work, pacience and discipline is needed.The Yayama's method is also used in the Kenji Tokitsu school in France."
2,"Well, I Can't Believe I Read The Whole Thing.","I agree with the comments above about psuedo-science. Regardless of who the author is or what he can do, he should have written a better book. It is also filled with inadequate information. Any of Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's books on qigong are far more useful and at least attempt to make sense when science is considered in explanations. Mantak Chia's ""Inner Structure of Tai Chi"" does a far better job covering the Microcosmic Orbit and circulation of external qi. I wish I didn't have to write a paper on this book for a grad. class. Its my own damn fault."
2,Yet another one,"It is baffling to me that a supposed medical doctor could produce such a book. it is filled with the ridiculous psuedo-science and parlor tricks that plagues the Qigong community. While he admits that he was iterested in psychosomatics, he never even attempts to collaberate with the western paradigm in his explination of qi. The effect is his Qigong book is the same old magic song and dance about how it is efective and and cannot be quatified by western science.This book does nothing to illuminate an art whos practice has recently been studied in depth and found to have many benefits. none of these scientific studies are mentioned. rather he ends the book with so-called pictures of qi. Embarassing, the fact that even today paople will belive photographic anomolies as ghosts or qi.Pass this one by and pick up ""the Body Electric"" for an interesting scientific idea about energy and human regeneration or ""Ki in daily life"" for a good Practical guide to the practice of Qigong."
1,terrible,The director fabricated most of the real story behind RR's killing spree. Don't waste your time or money on this.
2,Deception,This series has too many authors too many titles and too many titles that claim to be a certain order within the series and are not It is too confunsing to order them I would never reccomend them at all and will be selling the five I have at a garage sale for a very low price!!!
1,You get what you pay for.,"After wearing the rubber necklace for less than one month, the necklace broke, leaving me with a useless pendant. The moral of the story is: You get what you pay for."
3,Pro Track 300 Watt S-Wave Light Fixture,"Looks really nice once it is installed -- not that easy to install, requires patients -- would recommend if you don't mind a little effort --"
4,Great Light!,"Very attractive. Easy to install. Not terribly ""sturdy,"" but its mounted on a ceiling so I don't care. It looks great!Lamps Plus neglected to send the bulbs (which are supposed to be included). I called and they shipped out bulbs right away."
4,Well worth the read.,"Yes, it is the Gary Jennings of Aztec/ Journeyer/Raptor fame. As with all Jennings, it revolves around a journey. Strong characters, some humor, too short (which is not like Jennings at all). It is hard to believe that the publisher does not keep this in print (it is even harder to understand this with Spangle)."
2,hinges aren't very good quality,"We installed this, and the install was ok...as easy as it probably could be for something like this...but the hinges are hard to work with, they a pretty tight and for some reason get stuck about half way out. They aren't rubbing on anything and don't appear to have anything that is actually getting hung up. Just not very high quality. But for the price it works. We ordered the set and only needed one set of hinges for the two little baskets. We could have tried the other set but they didn't promise to be any better and we didn't want the hassle of taking one set off and reinstalling the other. We only open the tray about half way to get sponges and stuff out anyways so it works ok for what we needed but I would recommend spending the little extra and getting a better quality kit."
4,Is as described,The item is as described although it took alot longer to arrive and I had to contact them several times to receive the tray kit.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"These hinges were an absolute pain to install and did not work well. In fact one set was so out of alignment after installing that it wouldn't work properly at all. After more thorough research, we bought a pair of the Rev-A-Shelf Lazy Daisy Sink Front Pivot hinges, which were a little easier to install but more importantly have a much better and durable spring/hinge mechanism."
3,Just barely OK,"Product does work as described and installation was not really difficult. Cheap parts, however. One of the screw heads snapped off leaving the shaft imbedded in the cabinet. I wasn't even applying that much pressure. This required me to drill a separate hole in the hinge itself. If you buy this product I recommend using your own set of screws and throwing away the ones that come with the hinges.After it's all said and done, you do end up with some storage space you did not have before. Unfortunately it is very little storage space. In retrospect, it is not enough to warrant the time and expense."
2,Does it truly cost $800.00 ??,"I just want to know if this is a typo. What is the exact price? Does it truly cost $800.00 ??I would like to buy iy, but wanted to read the review first. I am not sure that I would like to spend $800.00 for a pocket book."
4,"Great CD, terrible shipping.","The CD is fantastic. Amazing lyrics, amazing instrumentals, and Andy Hull's voice is magnetic. Definitely a must for anyone who likes the band. However, the shipping was less than satisfactory. The inside of the case was broken; the little circle that holds the CD in place was smashed and the case had a crack in it. I was extremely upset with the way the CD was mailed to me."
4,"Dense, sonic, alterna-rock reminds of Superchunk, Pavement","Guitars up front, alternating with vocals up front in the slow sections; bass and drums provide muscle but remain somewhat sparingly in the background. I am struck first by the arrangements, credit to a production team that ""hears"" the songs. I hear things like Pavement and Superchunk in the post-punk/low-fi arrangements, which slow down at times to a stop and then the band comes chiming in with full bombast in the bridges. This is something you can listen to not rock out to so much. You can really enjoy this album on a number of listens as the layers reveal themselves slowly. Quite a talent captured here, I get the impression there was some rehearsal involved or live performance to get the arrangements to gel and flow. Each of the songs really stand alone as individual pieces, making this one of those ""album"" CDs that can be enjoyed from start to finish."
5,Best new band out there!,This cd is incredible and can fit any mood. Andy's voice is unique and very strong and the writing is wonderful. And check out their live show. Its definatly in my top five.
5,Good Stuff,I bought this cd on a whim and was really impressed with the arrangements and vocals... Think Lovedrug meets mewithoutyou.
5,CD,great album. case is broken but it's not that big of a deal. arrived quickly and on time with no issues. thanks!
5,best band to walk the earth,"manchester orchestra release of ""i'm like a virgin loosing a child"" is the best thing to happen to my life and i would not part with it for anything! It mixes the perfect amout if rock out with chill and all comes together perfectly! A++ gentlemen, keep up the good work and keep melting faces in the future"
2,"A simple lyrical and musical band, over rated album","I cannot write enough in the review to address the musical weaknesses of this album, dim witted lyrics, and over all POP rock feel. This album is a POP album, hands down. It may be a step in a decent direction for the tweeny rock music lovers, but anyone who has any taste in music knows that there are numerous albums that put this to shame. The only reason why I didn't give this album a 2 is because it isn't the worst thing i've heard in a while, just the most over rated. i wouldn't even buy this album for a friend that wanted it for a gift. open your ears to what else is out there kiddies"
4,Good Addition to an old fav!,"Heidi is a childhood fav. and courage mountain is a nice addition, it lets you make assumptions about Heidi and peter having a future together and I thought that was a great note to end on."
1,credibility?,"As a non-expert reader seeking an introduction in the field, I ""learn"" on the first couple of pages about a list of composers - Beethoven among them - being born in Vienna. How much is the reader to believe of the information he doesn't already know better by himself?"
5,Top Gear is great!,The great thing about the Top Gear seasons is that if you have seen the episodes on US TV you get quite a bit more on the DVD. The DVD is a full hour per episode.
1,Be cautious!,"After reading this book I set up an appointment with the doctor/author who has a practice in New York. At the time (2004) he charged me $800 for the visit and didn't take any insurance. I had to pay completely out of pocket. I saved my money because I thought his expertise may be valuable. Not only was he rude and curt, but was completely not helpful. For $800 I got absolutely nothing out of the visit. In fact, I think he's extremely sketchy. He wanted me to take x-rays and suggested I use HIS recommendation for an imagining company, even though I told him I prefer to use one that takes my insurance. He was adamant on using his choice, claiming others in New York don't ""do it right,"" only his recommendation does. This set up huge red flags for me. I believe he is getting kick backs from companies. I don't trust this doctor, nor his book. Just be wary."
2,The data DVD is corrupt,"The DVD that comes with the project files in the book is corrupt. I thought maybe the first one was an isolated incident, but then when I recieved a replacement I had the same issues. I couldn't retrieve any files and the DVD nearly crashed my computer.My belief is that this book came out so long ago that the disks deteriorated and that since there are going to be no upgrades to the software this book has basically had it.I'm sure that the instructions are helpful, but without the files you don't have any hands-on projects to work on, which is a bummer. There aren't really any alternatives to this book either.Apple should put these files online and allow people access to them if they have proof that they purchased the book."
5,works,It keeps my 6.2l Diesel suburbans transmission very cool when used in series with the old cooler. The only time I see temps on my 700r4 reach the 180 range is when off roading on a hot day.
1,Don't bother!,Teaching sixth graders is challenging enough without putting in a DVD with ancient graphics and out-of-date info!
3,Good Case,I brought this case as I had lost the default cover that apple provides. Personally I wanted a case with a belt clip. This case had that along with the other features a case would have. I have given 3 stars as I think the plastic screen gets covered with dust pretty easily. But worth the 10 bucks for a leather case.
5,"Intense, Poetic Performances","it is a mistery to me why a pianist of the stature of Grigory Sokolov is receveing so little support and exposure by the record industry. The performances in this cd are those of a great artist who, not only possesses a transcendental technique (i.e.sound control), but also a supreme musical mind, which is not easily satisfied by the simple beauty of the sound it can generate,looking for the deepest meaning behind the notes. In other cd's Sokolov has shown us that he posssesses also a virtuosity (finger dexterity which does not coincide with technique) of the greatest order, but in this cd he shows a fusion a technical and inetrpretative skills which put him among the greatest of contemporary pianists and, as far these compositions are concerned, almost on a level with Richter, Schnabel and Erdman, though his poetic view is closer to the first of these three giants."
5,THE MOST BENEFICIAL SELF-HELP BOOK I'VE EVER READ!,"Thank you Richard Carlson for writing this book. It was a joy to read, thanks to your knowledge and your wit. I believe the answers to leading a richer and happier life are right here in the pages of this book. I liken this book to AA for alcoholics, Weight Watchers for dieters and SmokeEnders for smokers. It is also a program that is presented in a clear and simple format, using basic terminology, yet its messages are profound in their impact towards attaining true peace of mind and personal fulfillment. I've known many people throughout my life (including myself) who put their hopes, time and money into traditional psychotherapy, only to become more hindered than helped through the process of reiterating and dredging up old wounds. Practicing the principles of this book regularly is cheaper and easier than a therapist and it is almost guaranteed you will find positive results."
2,Not the one you are looking for...,"This watch looks good, but it is really hard to read the time in less than bright light. The blue hands just don't show up very well. Another problem it the crown is too big and gets caught on things like my pocket when I put my hand in for my keys and then it pulls the crown out and changes the time. Very annoying and it might break the watch some day. Last complaint - the band is not made for smaller wrists. After adjusting the band for my wrist, the band does not flex enough to be comfortable and the crown (oversized, as I said before) digs into the back of my hand.As an update, this watch doesn't keep very good time. I have to adjust it every 2 weeks or so."
3,"Excellent concept, but terrible editing devalues the book.","The difficulty in using Oracle 10g is exceeded only by the difficulty in understanding its manuals - and this goes for Oracle's entire product line as well. The author is obviously trying to fill an important need: Demystifying Oracle 10g for beginners. But the grammatical errors means that this book will not (and cannot) be taken seriously by anyone wishing to learn Oracle. Perhaps this is a feature of authors who choose to self-publish or who cannot find a well established publisher for their texts (Apress, Oreilly, etc.) Perhaps in a second edition the author will have found a publisher who can provide both him and us with a more professional product. Neverthless, this is a valiant effort and there is no other book like it. Simplifying Oracle. What a great idea!"
2,Very disappointing,"Since I'm a fan of the artist involved I gave this a shot, and sure enough Olivetti does some nice work here. Unfortunately he also does some really below average incorporation of photographs into his work, which makes panels absolutely stand out instead of flowing with the storytelling. Joe Kelly tries to 'modernize' Space Ghost which means more tragedy and bloodshed in his past and a more vicious current version of the main character. None of it works, it feels like somebody read Miller's DKR and decided to rip it off and stick a template on a cartoon character. Character development is nada, and Olivetti's artistic choices give no menace to any of the villains including Zorak who is laughable.Overall a poor effort with some really misguided editing."
5,Much better than the talk show!,"Those who only know Space Ghost from the Cartoon Network ""talk show"" format might not realize something: Space Ghost was cool. As a nine-year-old in 1966 I got up every Saturday to watch him smack down the bad guys.This graphic novel brings cool back to the character. If you're obsessed with the original character, you won't be happy with it. The art is more detailed, the story line more complex. Space Ghost goes through more moral conflicts in this one book than he did in the entire TV series.The story line is his origin story. It covers where he came from, Jan, Jayce and all the cool gadgets. I won't spoil the story line by telling you the details, but if you like Space Ghost, you'll recognize most of the characters.If you like Space Ghost -- especially if you remember the original -- you'll like this."
4,pricey but nice,I love them. they are light and provide full sun protection because they are curved. the glass filters the rays and brightens the outside colors (not to mention they are hot too).
2,So Unbelievable...!!,"Can anyone imagine a small adult female kidnapping and tying up a big hunk?? I could not! The premise of this story was too much of a stretch. Amazing as I found ROAN was a fantastic story! The heroine waffled from one plan to another and all of them were way out in ""left field"" I have completed all the Benedict books - sorry this one was so disappointing!"
3,A little bizarre - but I am hooked on the series.,The book is about a mother who ties up her brother-in-law to the bed with hopes to steal his kidney for her daughter. The father of daughter is dead and the twin to the man she had tied up. I think I enjoyed 'Luke' book best but now that I am hooked I have to read all of them...
1,laughable,"I hate to say it, but the entire premise for the hero is just laughable. I couldn't even finish the book because of it. The thought that someone went all the way through four years of vet school, where needles abound (especially in the deep south - heartworm anyone?) could work there way all the way through, only to give it up after graduation, because they can't stand to cause anything any pain (including using needles) is a joke. I just couldn't make myself even start to accept the hero. Needless to say, I didn't make it far through the book, because I just couldn't believe in the hero. The rest of the book's premise is nothing to shout about either. Woman with a daughter by the dead twin brother of the hero, who no-one has ever heard about before, comes to town to steal a kidney from someone in the family. Oh please! I can read (and enjoy) paranormals, but a vet who spooks around needles is just too unbelievable."
2,Not up to standards,"I've really enjoyed many of Jennifer Blake's books, but this one really doesn't live up to the mature author I've come to appreciate. First of all, it was disappointing to not get to experience the hero and heroine meeting: the book starts off right after that. Unfortunately, the tension and interest that is usually set up at the first meeting isn't built up elsewhere. The premise for the story is really rather unbelievable, mainly because Janna, the heroine, is willing to make a dubious ethical choice in order to save her daughter's life at the beginning of the novel, but then isn't willing to do so later. The inconsistency and lack of real build-up is a real roadblock to feeling sympathy for the heroine or understanding for the attraction between the hero and her. Throw in too many bit-part characters that don't stand on their own without having read the other Benedict books and Clay comes across as just another deadline novel."
1,"Lame, lame, lame","I bought this book because I hadn't read a romance in a while and I remembered liking Jennifer Blake--about ten years ago. I didn't even finish it, it ended up in the recycle bin and if it's a good example of her current writing, she needs to retire. The plot is ridiculous, the emotional development between the characters is pathetic and without substance, the characters are about as complex as white bread and the narrative is absurdly cliche (how many times in one book can you say, ""it had nothing to do with -x- and everything to do with -y-"" before it gets silly? She needs to find a new favorite narrative line).I recommend trying her earlier books, which were much more original and compelling. I really liked Southern Rapture in particular."
1,I Couldn't Stand it,I just couldn't get into this book. The Senario was so ridculous until making this into a plot is criminal was well as nonsense. Being drugged and tied up by stranger is no joke. Ask me I know. This is was horrible and just not good.
2,There are better out there,I found I was not interested in the recipes. I have other cookbooks that I prefer to grap and explore.
2,Not at all helpful for the non-textbook patient,"This is a fine book if you happen to be in the minority of hypothyroid patients who are at their best with just thyroxine (T4) supplementation. Most hypothyroid patients are not truly healthy without T3 (liothyronine), however, and continue to suffer with brain fog, cold sensitivity, fatigue, etc. unless they are treated with both T3 and T4. (See, for example, the New England Journal of Medicine, 1999, volume 340, pp 424-429.) Furthermore, Dr. Rubenfeld provides no information for those who have ""normal"" TSH test results but are still hypothyroid, as evidenced by the results of rarer tests such as the TRH Stimulation test. The book is clear and well-written, but unfortunately not at all helpful if you are not a perfect textbook patient."
4,It could be my thyroid!!,"I was given the double opportunity to read the book and meet the author. I met Dr. Rubenfeld at a Houston conference. He took the time to write a book that can answer many questions. It is written in such a way that you do not need a medical degree or background to understand it. The narrative is laced with illustrations and celebrity ""thyroid newsmakers"" stories. A comprehensive glossary is provided for those medical terms lay people may not understand. Patient profiles bring a personal touch from those who have lived it."
2,Beware of medication bias,"I am excited that more physicians, like Dr. Rubenfeld, are really thoroughly exploring the epidemic of thyroid disease we have in this country. There is a great need!! The downside is that Dr. Rubenfeld is an advocate of synthetic medications (such as Synthroid). As someone who has suffered with Hashimoto's for years and and who has researched many medications, treatments and physicians, I have finally gotten relief from the majority of my symptoms by using Armour (the natural option). Unfortunately, for the thousands of women (especially) who are suffering with thyroid symptoms, these synthetic medications only make them feel worse by the day. Armour is much more effective in relieving the countless (torturous) symptoms. I would highly recommend ""Stop the Thyroid Madness"" for a more accurate picture of what those with thyroid disease actually go through and what tests they actually need for the best diagnosis and treatment plan."
5,Excellent product,I was unhappy with a stopwatch I bought in a national sporting goods store when I found this stop watch over the internet. I ordered it and I was extremely happy with it. Good product.
1,Terrible,"I gave this to my daughter for her birthday. The very first day she wore it, the hinge broke. I understand that the locket is inexpensive and lightweight, but that is no excuse for it being so poorly made."
3,"Disjointed collection, but some arresting work.","Though some of the work is stunning, overall I was disappointed by this book. The emphasis was too much on her Goth work (which pales next to Joel Peter Witkin, an obvious influence). Her self-portraits are amazing, as are her images of Martina and Neneh. I love her sensibility, but I hope she grows out of the old-asylum/goth/bondage/disemboweled/amputee/grotesque thing, which has been done to death. There is some really great work here, but I don't know if I'd pay the $35 ($50 retail) for this book again."
2,Derivative and over-rated.,The work in this book is well executed though reminds one of a current crop of well trained art & design students. The shock value turns out to be old hat. When one looks at the material in proper prospective the fact that there is not a genuine original idea running through the book becomes obvious. Many of the images remind one of the earlier work of then cutting edge music video directors.
3,Just a first impression,"I will preface this by saying I have soaked up as much Buck65 as I could find in perhaps the last 3 years. Going so far as to get the likes of DJ Signify and pick up Josh Martinez.I have never found the Buck65 cd that didn't immediately affirm my belief that he has more creative equity than almost every other artist and he throws out great narratives on geat songs... he's Bukowski, Cash and an old fisherman roled into one.This cd however didn't imake the normal impression on me and I am frankly a bit disappointed. I have listened to it but once and it might be wiser to listen to it a few times as it might grow on me. But if it needs to grow on me it isn't the standard Buck65 fare as far as i am concerned.As of Dec 29th the cd has grown on me and though I prefer other of Buck65's cds I like it more than I did at first considerably. be well"
4,"Classy, sensual and popular vocalist","Kate Ceberano is a classy, sensual and popular Australian jazz/pop vocalist who is highly-regarded here, and who has been a chart-topping pop star, a stage musical performer, a jazz vocalist and briefly a TV show host as well as an energetic, dynamic live performer in the 20 years from 1985 until now.I hope more people outside Australia choose this 18-track Best Of set to acquaint themselves with her style. It dates from 1999, and Kate has recently returned to the scene with a new album 19 Days In New York ( a collection of American standards). Check this True Romantic out!!!"
1,learn the craft elsewhere,"I am a sports journalist. Upon reading this text, I was disappointed. I found much of the writing to be shoddy and uninformative. Many of things in the text are things any beginning sports journalist would know. I could be wrong, but I got impression that the author knows little about sports. The best way to learn good sports writing is to read writers from a major paper or Sports Illustrated (Rick Reilly is fantastic). Books like this are a waste of time for any aspiring sports journalist."
4,Just What I Wanted,"These are exactly what I wanted in order to avoid using disposable cleaning & dusting wipes. They are super soft, as other reviewers stated, and I love the celadon color. They also have that microfiber ""clinginess"" that makes them perfect for dusting and polishing.I bought these on a Friday sale. After reading all the reviews, I decided they would be worth it at ~$1.80/towel. Apparently Amazon pays attention to these reviews. The product description has been corrected to accurately reflect the size of these towels, and there are now five in a set. Even though I knew they were only 12x12, the package was still smaller than I expected. I have uploaded a picture showing the size. I also didn't give this 5 stars because the Friday Sale price really should be regular price."
5,Awesome towels,"These towels are really great. The microfiber is perfect for cleaning clear plastic such as tupperware to a spotless shiny appearance. Also wonderful for glasses, computer screens etc. I highly recommend."
3,Stain badly,"These are nice but they stain and there is no way to get them clean. I tried bleach and still stained, not sure why microfiber is like that but it is."
1,A set of five?,"A set of five means that there is five dishclothes in each set for $1.99.That is not what I received...I ordered 13 sets and only received 13 dishclothes. Unfortunately, I need them for a project and reordered them today, assuming again that a ""set"" of five meant 5 clothes in each set. I am very disappointed. Hopefully, this problem will be corrected."
1,incorrect item description,"These ""dishtowels"" are described as 12x24"". I ordered two sets, and received two packages of 5 each, but they are only 12x12 in size. They are washcloths, not dishtowels. Item description is incorrect."
2,WRONG SIZE! But nice towels,"These are totally the wrong size. The item description says 12x24 inches but when I got the product they were all 12 inch squares. After a complaint to Amazon, they told me I could return the product and reorder it but I'd most likely receive the same thing, which is the incorrect product. Also, the price is now 4 times as much as when I purchased. They are really nice towels, very soft, ligh and thin. I just wish they were the right size. People reviewing before may have received the correct item. I ordered mine about a month ago and was told it would ship out when they were ""back in stock."""
1,Cingular LG cable doesnt work,"THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! It is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer, I wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer. NO WAY!the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it. I have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work. I dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is. The disk has 40+ files on it, I dont know if one of the other drivers would work, but I am very frustrated."
1,It's not working with Cingular LG CU 500,I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesn't work with it. Strongly I don't recommend this others.
1,Not Nessary,i bought it thinking it was required for data transfersit freezes my computer (brand new btw) so i ended up putting files straight onto the card without the usb cordYOU DO NOT NEED THIS
5,Works great,"I purchased this to get photo's off one of my friends phones. It has worked as expected. Thank you great buy. I probably will not use this again for a long time, but it works as expected thank you !"
1,Downloading Pictures From a LG 1400 Cell Phone,"Many people told me a cable was made to help anyone who had a LG 1400 cell phone to download pictures. Well I hate to tell you but its just not TRUE. In fact the seller sent me another cable but again no luck. Only once did it recognize the phone then died. I have yet to get to that point again. You can only use the software drivers with XP or before(2000, ME. etc.). But again it seems to load the drivers but when you plug in the cell phone nothing happens. Oh and by the way the phone has been upgraded so I can not send the pictures to anyone else that's the reason for the cable. Anyone have any ideas that might help...I would appreciate..."
2,Did not work for my phone,It would not transfer information or charge the device. Tried to trouble shoot it but looks like it was dead on arrival.
1,What a waste,It's amazing that a part that cost $.01 to buy cost an unbelievable amount to ship. Not to mention that when I received the merchandise it didn't even work. Don't bother wasting your time or money. I would have returned the item but already spent too much having it shipped to me in the first place.
5,Truely everything you need to know about pool maintenance,This book covers just about everything about maintaining and/or upgrading your pool equipment. It has very technical but clear information as well as basic troubleshooting problems. I am in process of upgrading my motor/filter and this book will save me money and aggrevation by doing it myself. You can often get wrong or misleading information from so called experts but this book will set you on the right track and you will become your own expert.
5,"The ""Haynes"" manual for pools","This book is to swimming pools what the ""Haynes"" car maintenance manuals are to your car. It contains all the information required to maintain your pool, even though probably someone else is going to do it for you. If you own a pool, it is worth reading the book to understand what the service technician should and shouldn't be doing, and when the pool is in need of help. It can also help you save some money by doing the work yourself. The book is entirely about maintaining a pool, not owning one. It is written in a friendly, readable style, and you can simply keep it as a reference manual to know what to do when things go wrong. If you are considering installing a pool or spa, this book will show you what you are letting yourself in for. If there is one omission in the text it is that the author ignores electric pool cleaning robots, though they are probably the most effective way of keeping the pool clean."
1,Save your Money,"This book was a wasste of time and money. The book focuses more on being a pool professional then the actual ""how-to"" a pool owner needs to work on their pool. It has more information on changing a light fixtures and on bilking wealthy Malibu folks out of cash then actual useful information.After reading this (useless!) book I went to my local library and reearched several books on the subject, there is a title called ""What color is your pool?"" That has lots of information for the first time pool owner. There may be other more technical guides our there, but this book has few drawings and illustrations, poor writing, and ultimately is lacking in adequate information.Trust me...SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,The Ultimate Pool Maintenance Manual,"This book was a complete waste of my money. The seller neglected to state in the ad that the book has a copyright of 1996/2001 (16years old). This book is worthless for a newer saltwater pool with the newer features and equipment. Don't waste your money. You can ""google"" more information for your pool than this book provides. It's not even a good doorstop because it's too light."
4,Ultimate Pool Reference,"I've never had a pool or spa before so no prior experience. Not wanting to be at the mercy of a pool service company I decided to do the work myself when I could. Needing a deeper understanding than the local pool-supply company could provide, I bought The Ultimate Pool Maintenance Manual. So far I've read several chapters in-depth; the book has provided the background understanding I need as well as much of the actual ""how-to"" instruction. My pool's water chemistry has stabilized and this coming weekend I plan to open and clean my DE filter. I can't give the book 5 stars simply because I haven't read it cover-to-cover and probably never will. But as a reference manual, it sure is handy."
3,pretty good,"This was a pretty good CD, but not my most favorite. I enjoyed several tracks and found them rather relaxing"
4,Valuable perspective,"Not only tourists, but civically-lazy locals, don't see or don't care about the power-brokers and their schemes. I lived in nearby Poway from 1969 to 1982, age 9 to 22, and would have loved to be better informed, although working for someone who lost his job when US National Bank went under, and hearing his too-terse account, helped a bit (Fred Whitmore, wherever you are, thanks). Thanks to the authors for filling this hole."
1,Product is wrong size,"I was hoping that the previous customer who noted a ball that was much too small had somehow just been shipped the wrong product by mistake; since everyone seemed to like the product, I gave it a try.Unfortunately, I, too, got bitten by the ""too-small ball."" I ordered the 75cm product, the color is right, and the box says 75 cm, but the ball is closer to 55cm in diameter from a quick measurement. I'm 6'2"" -- I feel like I'm in the Stonehenge scene from This is Spinal Tap.Perhaps Amazon just got a shipment of these that were incorrectly labeled?"
2,Too small!,"As other reviewers have mentioned this ball is not even close to 75cm. I wasn't sure what size I needed, so I bought the 65 and 75 cm balls. Once inflated they are the exact same size. The instructions say to re-inflate after a day to account for stretching but this makes no difference.The enclosed pump is somewhat useful for topping up the ball but you really need another air source for the initial inflation. I used a 4"" floor pump for inflatables and even that took 5+ minutes per ball."
4,Holly Lisle Improves,"I have enjoyed Holly Lisle's work before, but have not been all that impressed. This work shows a great improvement in her writing. 'Talyn' portrays a vividly imagined world and features a strong, mature female protagonist. She has put a lot of thought and craft into her world building, and it has paid off. I can't say I much like her created language's style, but she is consistent in its usage and it aids in identifying the culture.I found 'Talyn' nearly impossible to put down, and enjoyed it thoroughly."
5,Rulers of Evil,"A very informative book. It explains the need for a ruling entity to govern evil and aptly demonstrates that entity's roots and purpose. I would recommend this book for anyone who seeks to understand why we were told to ""submit to the authorities in power"" in order to live in peace."
4,"""RULERS OF EVIL""? You say that like it's a *bad* thing...","F. Tupper Saussy argues that the machinations of a centuries-old, secretive religious order is the hidden hand behind the workings of the Vatican, the US government and other world powers... but perhaps it's not so simple as that. Unlike most conspiracy theorists, he also concludes that maybe it's all to the good, you know, part of God's master plan. In any case it makes for a compelling read, reminicent of the film DOGMA, the style a bit like a double-cross between Clancy and Andrew Greeley, even if the author sometimes skews his perspective, throwing in lots of innuendo, at times playing fast and loose with the facts..."
5,Spirit of the United States,"Tupper Saussy has exhaustively researched the founding of the United States and identified the real power brokers responsible for establishing this country. The historical and religious evidence is overwhelming and should convince anyone who dismisses the sinister influence of the Jesuits and the extent to which our Founding Fathers deliberately implemented a Babylonian/Roman/Masonic spiritual framework for American governance. Saussy's most remarkable assertion is that all of this is Biblical - God has ordained the ""Rulers of Evil"" as the rightful agency of political dominion through a line beginning as far back as Cain. His insight is uncanny as he weaves every possible thread together to elucidate the true nature of political power and demonstrate how God ultimately uses both of the two ministries that have emerged from His divine plan to bring people to salvation."
5,Rulers of Evil,"Outstanding! Tupper Saussy did a thorough job in writing this book. As journalist, historian and Biblical scholar myself, he approached this subject from angles I have not observed before. This book is a must for these times and weaves a strange and intriguing web that has been woven through time. I highly recommend this book to anyone seriously wanting to continue their research in what makes the human race really tick."
3,"Good on the history, lacking on the argument","Although it is hard for the average person to accept the theories of this book in reference to the aide in the creation of the United States and other Western events, the book lays out the 'other side' of history that many historians acknowledge but which does not make it into the history books.The knowledge of history and the backing up of facts in this book is very good,but the arguments are very lacking. The problem with the arguments are that you can sense an underlying distaste of the government by the author which somewhat lends to bias. He makes good historical theories, but from his expereince vs. the US Goverment, he tends to indulge his 'hatred' in his offerings.Although the flaw in logic of the arguments, I would still recommened this book based on the historical research which many people in the world are not privy to."
1,The Jesuit Order Rules the earth?,"The Jesuits rule the earth? A Jesuit had Sun Tzu Art of War translated? Big Deal. This author list men of power at the time it was written. He mentions The late Dan Rostenkowski busted for "" use of Congressional funds to buy gifts such as chairs and ashtrays for friends, and trading in officially purchased stamps for cash at the House post office."" Wow Rostenkowski such power. Sen. John Kerry is powerful but is he a Catholic? Ok the ""powerful"" Kennedy family JFK assinated Robert Kennedy assinated as well as John John Ted dead from a brain tumor who is left. How much money does the Roman Catholic owe? This book is silly."
1,It's a dreadful shame. . .,". . .that educated Americans have not out-grown this stuff.Mr. Saussy has a great deal of credit to his name. He was highly regarded in his field, and excelled at what he did (songwriting). But this attempt is pathetic at best.Regardless of whether one is Protestant or Catholic, any good historian can poke holes in what I will graciously call Mr. Saussy's ""theory"" without breaking a sweat. As far as ""conspiracy theories"" go, this one is weak -- at best.Negative stars. Don't waste your valuable time."
1,Should be no stars. . .,". . .for this ridiculous (even for ""conspiracy theorists"") exercise in American nativism. The editorial review which compared this book to ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" was right on target.Frankly, the publisher ought to be ashamed."
1,dissapointing,"received item in a timely fashion, only when I opened the box to take the photo albums out, they were seperated from the binding. It looks like old stock thats why its falling out of the album covers. Save your money."
2,Look before you buy!!!,"The book has some really great definitions, but needs to be more user friendly for the beginning programmer. I found it hard to follow. The book came with a diskette which I never used, nor did the book explain how to. The first 2 sample programs are good. There are also a few errors in the sample programs that even the programmers here where I work couldn't help with. The book needs alittle more work in order for the beginner to understand."
2,definately not worth the money.,this book shows all signs of being quickly thrown together with no editing or proofreading. From chapter one the text and source in the book has glaring errors that make it almost useless the the beginning RPG programmer.
2,A World Gone Wrong,"As some others have stated, I was a huge fan of the .Hack//sign series. When I saw roots, I was very excited to see the next generation of characters. However, I quickly got over that excitement.As others have said, the pacing is off. Nothing much seems to go on for large chunks of time. On top of that, one of the things that really turned me off were the characters in general. It's like every griefer from every MMO you've ever played all banded together in one place. I can't stand those people in my games, and they're not any more entertaining when I watch them animated on my television. The heroes aren't really much better, and it's hard for me to get on their side, or become emotionally invested in their quest.Whatever happened to wreck The World, it wrecked the francise too. This is for die hard fans only."
3,Slow start but I see potential,The episodes on this DVD are slow to get to a point. The creators seem to be trying (too hard and needlessly) to emphasize that there's more than what you see going on. If you've watched .hack//SIGN then I think this will be somewhat more interesting to you because it feels like a continuation.
3,Ehh.,"I loved .hack//Sign. It's probably one of my favourite shows. So, naturally, when I saw Roots on cartoon network, I decided to watch it.I tried to like this show. I really, truly did. I watched nearly the entire season of it- but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. It just wasn't good enough. It just couldn't capture my attention. I guess it was kind of boring. And the music- God, the music was terrible. The artwork /was/ nice though, which is why it was worthy of 3 stars. It wasn't the worst show ever- I mean, if it was that bad, I wouldn't have watched nearly 20 episodes of it. But I absolutely do -not- recommend this show, unless you are really a hardcore fan of .hack."
2,virtual world gaming Japanese style,"This dvd is a set of episodes about about a virtual realitygame called ""The World"". In this one the two guilds are rivals for membershipand finding the ultimate secret of the game.The theme music is kind of irritating at times,but some of the composition as background music are really kind of well done.The male main character is the newbie Haseowho actually appears more female looking than male by western standards.no one would be caught dead with his hair-do?Or the cheesy jump suit he wears either...The femaleplayers seem either weaker or more evil than their male counterparts.The format is kind of hypnotic in effect and seems meantto get kids to buy into online multipersoninteractive gaming as a sport."
4,Older curriculum still hits the target,"Waldo Beach was a long-time professor of ethics at Duke Divinity School. A favorite of students, he was able to teach in a way that made his subjects accessible and exciting. This volume was written to be used by laypeople in Sunday school. He covers many topics, chapter by chapter (race, consumption, world systems, forgiveness, affluence, leisure, citizenship, power, etc), each ending with discussion questions for use in a group. In spite of the fact that the book is now 41 years old, Beach's comments are timely and insightful for today."
4,Ethics for Sunday school,"Waldo Beach was a long-time professor of ethics at Duke Divinity School. A favorite of students, he was able to teach in a way that made his subjects accessible and exciting. This volume was written to be used by laypeople in Sunday school. He covers many topics, chapter by chapter (race, consumption, world systems, forgiveness, affluence, leisure, citizenship, power, etc), each ending with discussion questions for use in a group. In spite of the fact that the book is now 41 years old, Beach's comments are timely and insightful for today."
4,Great,"I personally like that you can change the pencil out with another pen. I know there is a review commenting on why someone would do this, but i personally don't use pencils in my job. So; that is why i would like two pens. They seem to be good quality pens to me and write well. Good Cross quality."
2,not the greatest,"I wanted a nice pen/pencil set and I was somewhat disappointed with this one.Pros: Looks very niceCons: This pen and pencil set is very small in diameter and somewhat difficult to hold an and write with. The writing quality of the ballpoint is ""blotchy"" and equivalent to a 59 cent bic. I expect more for a so called ""fine writing"" instrument set"
3,wrong set,"I have a deck set and I wanted replacement for the pen and pencil. This is not the set for that problem. This is to be worn in a pocket not on a desk. However, Amazon took back the set without issue"
1,Not the item pictured,"The manufacturer is distributing a different pen/pencil set than the one illustrated and described. Cosmetically the pens are a flat black -- could be mistaken for grey; but more importantly the ""pencil"" is not the typical cross .05mm pencil. It is a pen/pencil combo -- you can put either an ink cartridge in it (for 2 pens, who knows why) or a special .07mm lead cartridge -- not individual leads, but a self contained cartridge physically similar to an ink cartrdige -- to use it as a pencil. Of course, you can't tell them apart when you pull one out of your pocket. One has to twist it and see what comes out - the pen or the pencil (or other pen if you go that way).This happened to me at another large retailer (large web, lots of physical stores) so it looks like Cross is doing a number on people. Major, major disappointment.Good luck!"
2,Not the quality of the cross pens of old,"Bought five sets to give as gifts and am a little disappointed. The pens / pencils kind of look cheap and the quality of the packaging is not what it used to be, even a few years ago. This is definitely not the presentation quality I remember or was hoping for. Another great brand becomes mediocre chinese crap."
2,"pen and pencil is great, however","i ordered this product a few months ago, and the pen and pencil are great, however the eraser refills are hard to find in stores (in fact im still looking), when i was looking for the erasers at office depot i noticed what appears to be the same pen pencil set for 20 dollars cheaper."
1,Bummed out about Cross Classic Century mechanical pencil,"I've loved having a Cross pen and pencil set for many years. My 13 yr old son always liked the feel of them and I just bought him a Classic Century set. Right out of the box, the pencil won't advance the lead. Oddly, my husband was given a similar set a few months ago by his employer and it had the exact same problem, right out of the box. I was about to pay the $10 to have the first one replaced by Cross, but now I'm suspicious of the brand not being worth anything anymore. Any suggestions?"
1,Not the pencil in the product description or the photo,"As other reviewers have noted, Cross has switched the pencil in this set from their classic 0.5 mm to a new 0.7 mm model, but for some mysterious reason, they have kept the old model number, which causes a lot of confusion. I wanted the 0.5 mm, not an 0.7, so I requested a refund. Amazon was very obliging. So this negative review applies only to Cross's incorrect information, not to Amazon as a merchant."
3,Looks nice writes poorly.,"Good looking and well made pen/pencil. Not very comfortable when writing for an extended period. I have tried both a fine and medium tip ink and both are not smooth when writing, similar to a standard BIC pen. I have found the Parker Jotter as a good lost cost alternative to this pen. Also, look to switch out the ink for another as the best part of this pen is the barrel."
2,Nice idea -- poor execution,"The Verilux Shop Light seems like a great idea -- bright, natural light for detailed shop work. The problem is that the clamp is cheap plastic and is not made right to mount on a vertical surface. Also, if you happen to hit the wire cage with something, the bulb is so delicate, it will stop working. If you do things like load shotgun shells or do crafting, it probably is OK, but for someone who REALLY uses it in a shop, you'll find it just isn't rugged enough."
5,By far the very best venison cookbook out!,I have been a hunter for many years and Rick Black has the best venison and deer hunting books. 5 STARS!!!
3,Simple review,"After playing the demo version I have decided to buy it. The game has very good graphics in my opinion and, the playability is simple to grasp. Anyone who has ever played EVEonline and Starcraft will understand the basics of this game in short order. I found the tutorials and the missions within the Demo version very easy after playing the before mentioned games. The game itself is fun and entertaining, but for single players, it will get old quickly."
3,"got this game for $2.50 on steam, got what I paid for","This game looked really cool, I mean come on, genetic ships?Naw, the single player is very vague as to what you're supposed to do, the graphics are rather subar, and it's not really clear what the hell you're supposed to be doing.Am I supposed to create ships via the mothership, or capture resources? or do I just search and destroy the enemy? What does everything do? Little to no documentation in game to let you know what the heck the goal is.Kind of disappointed because I haven't been able to enjoy this at all."
1,Did they even try?,"This is serously the worst game I've ever played, slow, boring, and overall not much to do. I swear these guys must have slapped this game together using morse code or something. You'd be better of feeding your money to your dog."
3,Depends why you buy the book.,"This book lists many of his inventions, the process he used to build them and some of the profits he made from them. Really more bibliographical of his inventions than lessons on how to invent or market your product. If you like reading about creative endevors or have a mechanical bent, this book is very interesting as he goes into how the inventions are made. But if you are looking on help for inventing, there are better books than this."
2,Shalamar review,This cd does not have many of the original versions that I enjoyed as a youth. Most are cut off half way through to make room for more songs.
5,Better than expected!,"This cd has been unfairly reviewed. This kind of dance music, never loses its steam. I love all of the songs on this cd. Lighten-up and just have fun!"
5,Dessert University by Mesnier,"This book would be excellent for anyone interested in preparingquality desserts . It includes recipes for kiwi, peaches andnuts, dried fruit scones and homemade ice cream. The work iswritten in simple English together with easy-to-follow recipes.It is worth the price for the highly consolidated collectionof desserts from all over the world. Another strength of thepresentation is that the repertoire of menu items can becustomized for weight loss and dietary purposes with a minimumof effort."
1,NOT for beginners ..........,"My mistake. I should have read the reviews closer. The people who think it's great are professional chefs! It's not that the recipes aren't clear, but when you are a beginner you really need pictures. I thought that something with University would be a teaching book, but 18 photos do not a ""lavishly illustrated"" book make. And without them you're basically stuck as to how it should look when you're finished ... if you are a beginner like myself."
5,The French know Best !!!,Roland writes a great book for the home cook and trained pastry chef. His style is wonderful and its hard to believe this is the man responsible for making the president of the United States Birthday Cake. I am going to keep this one forever!
4,Great bag.,"this was a great investment for my motorcycle. i only wish the side magnets were located a little farther back towards the rear of the bag.. my gas tank is half metal a and half plastic so the side magnets dont always make contact with the metal.. but all in all, it still works great for what i need it for."
2,Doesn't stick to my tank,"The bag over all is great, the straps to convert to a backpack or messanger bag is a must. Also, the bag has alot of room inside and pockets for storage. My problem with the bag is that it does not stick to my tank. Does anyone else have that problem or did I get defective magnets? I own a CBR 600 RR and the picture in the advertisement show's a sport bike, which is why I purchased this product over other products that showed the bags on cruisers."
3,800 years in 50 minutes,"It's difficult to compress the Dark Ages into a 50 minute DVD, but this attempt is middling worthy of its epic topic, though it's a bit thin. Many talking heads, and some re-enactments mar the effort. It's ok to watch if you get it from the library."
2,England Centuries Ago,"This had a nice survey history of England from the fall of Rome until the arrival of William the Conqueror. Nothing is said about Ireland or Scotland and that may disappoint some. The work even contextualizes the term ""Dark Ages.""As a 21st-Century American, it's easy to say ""English"" and mean ""British."" We moderns have to remember England, Scotland, and Wales. However, this documentary showed that the Island was cut up in many different ways centuries ago. I learn about kingdoms such as Wessex and Northumbria, etc. There is much focus on the Vikings and thus Scandinavians and their descendants in the United States may find that interesting.This work had many cheesy reenactments when the art of the time would have sufficed. The work applauds itself for its 3-D graphics, but I wasn't awed by that."
5,Spacious !,"Backpack is super spacious. Very well made, and the quality of the fabric is outstanding and durable. It's a great back pack to use for camping, or overnight stays etc. I find it to be too big for school use."
1,You get what you pay for,"I got this backpack for my 8 year old son for school. I had bought a different K Cliffs backpack for my other son earlier and was pleased with the quality of the bag for the price. This bag, however was not of good quality. Within a week, the zipper was broken. After 1 month of use, you can see through the bottom of the bag and there is a small hole in it! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,this bag didnt survive 5th grade!,I purchased this bag for my son to use in 5th grade.It appeared big enough to hold all his books etc.Within 1 month the zipper is broken and the side straps are coming undone.I now need to buy another backpack after only 1 month.I expected this bag to at least last 1/2 the school year...
3,School Backpack,"I purchased this for my son who is in second grade and it was too large. I had to return it and order something else. Product seemed to be okay but if you are ordering for a young child, it might be too big."
5,Great Back Pack,"This is a great Back Pack, my daughter loves it. It is nice and big and was a reasonable price."
5,excelent,"excelent stethoscope, it was a gift to my son, and he is happy with his new littmann, it is a great stethoscope"
2,Software Adequate BUT Falls Short,"I used other software to draft a Trust several years ago and needed to make changes. The Nolo Software just purchased fell short in documents needed to support a Trust document package. You need a Living Will, Pour Over Will, Durable Power of Attorney and other support documents to help the everyday individual set up a Trust. If this is all there is... it might be better than nothing if you can't afford an attorney and I suggest buying a book to help you cover all of your legal concerns. Doing something to protect your estate is better than doing nothing"
1,Scam ! Shame on you.,This tool was part of Willmaker before 2010 version. I can not believe I don't have this tool when I purchased and received the most expensive 2010 Willmaker. Shame on Nolo. They have become a company I CAN NOT trust.
4,Evocative and powerful,"If you want sweeping naturalistic fiction that blends the oppressiveness, madness and occasional terror of Stalinist Russia with a traditional, ultimately melodramatic love story, start with Rybakov's ""Children of the Arbat"" and continue through the trilogy with ""Fear"" and this novel. Accurately or not, these novels vividly create a sense of smothered life in Russia, with characters who represent types without becoming stereotypes. These novels are page turners in the tragic Russian tradition."
3,A messy-looking Turandot,"No doubt I am spoiled by the Metropolitan production of Turandot with Eva Marton, but I was distracted throughout by the sloppy appearance of the Princess. Why a floppy shapeless dress that looked like a bedsheet, and ungroomed hair that looks like your worst nightmare? The straight hair to the ankles seemed downright dangerous, but even worse it was ridiculous. Lui's slavegirl dress had more style and so did her hair.Am I mistaken, or did they cut the third act short? Final scene between Calaf and Turandot was shorter than other versions I have seen.Other than the above, I liked the performance. The singing was terrific, and the acting was better than other wooden performances. Still, the gold standard is the Metropolitan's Marton/Domingo."
4,"Turandot, Arena di Verona, 1984 DVD","A great production. Nicely filmed for 1984. Beautiful setting, beautiful voices, beautiful singers. What more could I want?"
5,Another Winner from Language Dynamics,I was thrilled to experience another 'winner' with Behind the Wheel Spanish level 2.All new material and two native speakers (male and female) make this course a needed addition to any aficionado's language collection.The book with tapecript is also a big plus.
2,Poor CD Quality,"I purchased this audio CD with great anticipation of practicing basic Spanish grammar as I drove to work. However, when I put the CD into my car's multi CD player, it skipped and jammed. When I finally ejected it I saw the problem. The CD has a paper label on it which causes CD's to jam in most multi-CD players. I then thought, ""I bought it...so I'll just burn it to another CD so I can still use it."" (btw, this does not violate any copyright law since it was for single, personal use) But the recordings are of such low quality, all I got was a buzzing noise out of the copies. I never got to hear the lessons so it would be unfair to give the product a one star rating. But since the publishers of this CD refuse to use good quality CD's, I gave it a generous two star rating."
5,Best in the series,I have all three levels of Behind the Wheel Spanish and while they are all good I felt that this one was the most enjoyable. This continues where the first set left off and continues to focus on phrase and sentence building. Each phrase is given in English first and then Spanish it making it very easy to follow. As the CDs progress more complex setnece structures are introduced. There are also some short stories which use the material learnt earlier and there are both male and female Spanish speakers. After using these CDs I have been able to hold simple conversations with Spanish speakers.My one criticism is that the CDs have a problem with skipping however the content is so good that I still give them 5 stars.
2,A bit disappointed,"This product would be useful for someone who is interested in practicing their pronunciation, especially someone who has not much speaking practice. I also think this program would be best used after one or two semesters of college or high school Spanish but not on its own because it does not teach you any grammar rules. I personally, did not find the program very useful. I think it would be better if it went in chronological order. For example, all greetings, then practicing present tense, then past tense etc. I bought the program because of all the positive reviews but I am bit disappointed."
2,Too Fast for a Slow Talker,"This is a standard listen and repeat method. The voices are clear. The first two CD's include rudimentary phrases.There is not enough time provided after the phrase one is asked to repeat. The recorded voice returns too quickly, and moves on to the next phrase. This is frustrating, more so when one is also trying to drive. The attempts to scroll back the recording can be tricky."
4,CDs are great,"The only problem I have had with these tapes is that the seem to have a skip or something and I didn't notice it until I got to it (the 3rd or 4th CD in the set). By then it was really too late to return them. However, for the most part I don't have a lot of problems with them and I do like the lessons."
2,"May be great, but big problem with packaging","I've received two sets of these so far, and in both instances the CDs arrived loose in shipping, instead of being secured. Both sets arrived with several badly scratched CDs. There appears to be a design flaw in the packaging."
5,Fantastic series!,"I am most of the way through the 1st series of 8, and find the CD's to be fantastic! I am learning to speak Spanish! I have been spending about 1-2 months per CD, just when in my car, and find the technique on the CDs to be excellent! Highly recommend!"
5,Owner's Manual,"This jewel of a book first came to me back early in ""93.This is a precise, clearly written ownersmanual of who we are and how to operate our humancomputer. Yes it mentions this or that but, that is not what this little only seventy-three pages book is about. I would give this book a 10 star+ if I could. Those who do not get excited reading this jewel don't get it and those who do, will pass the teaching on to their deserving children/friends. Those who don't get it are at the kindergarten level trying to read a thesis on physics. Amazing how the mind can prevent us from seeing the teaching when we are not ready, no matter how clearly stated it may be. The great Kahuna, Master Jesus: ""you who understand will know the truth and the truth will set you free."" I need say no more."
5,The Only *Practical* Huna Magic Work Available,"Forget expensive real life seminars, DVD sets, other books (including Max Freedom Long's) if you are looking for hands on Huna that works in the real world. Get your history and theory elsewhere, but come to Glovers book when you are ready to make the magic *happen.* I've owned, studied, and used used this slim volume since it was first published and recently, when I couldn't find my original copy, had to by a used one for $40. Money well spent."
3,Huna Claims,"The book is good for some huna techniques, but not all. It's no clear and some parts are mixed with other teachings. Most huna authors add material from other teachings like NLP, religion, eastern meditations, new age. In fact there are 7-10 techniques for self help and personal development, but most authors dont show, because of ego side I think. If you want some huna taste buy this book."
5,Cute Outfit! Quick Question:,"This is a very cute outfit! I got a quick question.....will this fit the Bratz Big Babyz? I can't find the outfits for them anywhere right now!!!!!!!!! If anyone can answer my question, that would be great! Thanks! Oh, and if you're a Baby Annabelle fan, then get this! It's got everything that your baby needs for underwear or to sleep in (they look like pjs to me). Not that I collection this line of dolls, b ut I would recommend this to anyone who does! 5 stars! Ashley"
5,A must read if you work with data!,"I've been a database programmer for 15 years but I've never kept up with the ""latest"" database concepts. Reading Beginning Relational Data Modeling was a great way to get myself up to date! I never learned about conceptual and logical models. So this book was a real eye-opener!It starts out with a great introduction which includes data normalization. Every developer that works with data should know what the first three are. Apparently there has been another one added called Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF). This one was new to me and I thought it was explained very well.I thought the book was very informational. I think every developer that works with data should read this book to bring themselves up to data on the latest data modeling concepts."
5,Had to buy this book,"I am currently doing a Masters degree in VLSI, and although this is not on the required book list, after trying endless parametric simulations of critical path device sizes, and trying to find the minimum delay, I found Logical efforts to be a much more elegant approach to doing that. Although some other books discuss it in minimal detail, there is no mention of if the same can be extended to other logic families other than Static CMOS. I went through a few pages of the book, and decide it to be a must buy. I also thought it was pretty cheap for 60$. Unfortunately, the book is pretty small - it's not like a 500 page book which I was expecting it to be.I am yet to read through the whole book (which I plan to - very soon), and shall update this review once I am done with that. But I am expecting it to be worth the every cent I paid for it."
2,Leaky flask = no good,"Kinda leaks - too bad. I thought Coleman made their products in the USA. FALSE, it is made in China and cheaply at that."
2,Cheaply Made & Looks It,"This flask is described as having a stylish leather cover, but in reality it has a cheap looking cover that's poorly stitched. The flash itself feels like it's made of tin. Not recommended."
1,Coleman must have been drinking when they made this flask,Very Poor quality lather cheaply glued as two pieces to the metal flask. The Lid didn't even screw on the whole way due to a burr on the threads. Its very disappointing to see Coleman put their name on this. Looks good in the picture you could buy better quality in a dollar store. I guess the Coleman name doesn't mean anything anymore. Made in china piece of crap.
3,Tailgater Flask,"I had wanted to buy a brand new one, but I guess I must have bought a used one which was disappointing. The product was overall in a good condition though except for a little dust on it and of course the inside was a little dirty. I did have to thoroughly clean it, but it was not so bad. I loved the leather cover it came in well kept, the colour however is a little darker than it appears in the picture. I would recommend purchasing the product but of course be sure to purchase a brand new flask."
4,A Must for Sports Fans and Collectors,"This is a terrific book filled with beautifully produced color images of hundreds of sports movie posters. It goes beyond the standard popular sports such as baseball, basketball and football. There are also sections on auto racing, soccer, tennis and much more. It covers posters from the 1910s right on through the 1990s. Most of the pictures are of one-sheets, but there are also examples of lobby cards, half-sheets, etc. Many of the posters are from movies I never even knew existed. This would make a great gift for movie poster collectors and sports memorabilia collectors alike."
5,MOVIE POSTER HOBBY still in its infancy,"I own several movie poster books created by Bruce Hershenson, and they all are all of exceptional quality. His images of classic film posters are second to none. He always seems to find the most unique images of all our favorite films. His books cover all genres; however, SPORTS MOVIE POSTERS is, of course, my favorite. Collectors of sports autographs and other memorabilia will want to be sure to become familiar with these rare collectibles. You will be surprised to see how many sports and baseball icons like New York Yankees legends Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle have showed up in film. Be sure to check out Hershenson's other books featuring SCI FI and ACADEMY AWARD WINNERS."
3,WCW UnCensored 95 (2),"Sting carried Bubba Rogers in a match, the Boxer/wrestler match is entertaining, Hogan/Vader match was good, until all the interference. Ric Flair in drag was awkward for everyone watching, and how. This show is bad, but not brutally bad, like WCW Worldwide, WWF Metal and ECW cable tv show, more like an episode of Raw or Nitro kind of bad. It was cool on pay per view, and is worth seeing."
2,THIS PPV IS PRETTY BAD...,"The mving vehicle match was pretty bad except for the fact that it's SMASH from DEMOLITION wrestling in this one, that sort of changed it from unbareable to hilarious. The martial arts whatever with meng and HACKSAW of all people, this guy can't even wrestle!!! Don't complicate things he'll go into a coma if you do. The Sting match with Bossman was good, actually it was teh best of the PPV. The Nasty/Harlem wasn't to bad except for the whole suspension of disbelief theory of wrestling gets shattered to pieces and Sherri follows the action but steers clear the whole time of danger. The Main Event...common Vader could dip Hogan and ranch dressing and eat him if he wanted to but Hogan bumps for no one and that pretty much sums up the match. Flair does a run in and sets up the next PPV.... Don't buy."
1,Don't even think about it!,"Garbage. ""Uncensored""??? There is nothing to censor, it's boring, trite, crap."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"The worst PPV of the year, if not the decade! WCW was awesome until the ... Hulk Hogan arrived. The undercard was horrible also. This is not even worth renting. BAD!!!"
2,"I got jipped! like they said, no meat and potatoes","The value of this book lies only in the theory of art and color and texturing, and thats about it. If you already know these theories and just want to get going, this book is useless because chances are you already have other tutorial books. I don't have Maya or other expensive programs. Even if I did, the tutorials are very sparse. No tutorials for Photoshop or blender. The problem i have with this book is I couldn't figure this out by the description. This has become a coffee table book. There are also no weblinks for freebees or freebee tutorials."
2,Try something else...,"I was looking for a book on creating textures in photoshop or painting in photoshop, but this is not the book. It had a few tutorials on creating textures, but I had to read through half of the book first. If you are serious about buying this book, you should take the time and check it out in your local book store first."
2,rather poor if you ask me,"this guide is definatley one of the worse guides i have ever used. I foud items that weren't listed at the begining of each section mislabled items, a couple of their boss sugestions were poorly done, in the final fight it claims Zeromus is a counter atacke well he's not onc you hit him he dose't stop. Directions were poorly done, secret areas were not described. Their suggested levels were too high, up until the final boss fight wher they are pretty acurate"
4,Gets the job done!,"This is a well written guide covering two wonderful games. I found it very helpful, especially for Chrono Trigger, which I had not played in any form before.It's got all the basics covered, but there were a few tricks that it left out, such as the rather odd but very useful trick of slowing down the battle speed in FFIV to make the battles easier."
3,Chrono Trigger walkthrough,"I strongly think that this book is useful and helpful for both of the games that it covers. If you need help in either or both games, I suggest that you get this book or figure things out on your own. This book covers everything the games have to offer. Also, this book not only covers one game, but both games that are packaged together."
2,Dan Birlew is Inconsistent,"I have found that in several other guides written by dan birlew the items, magic, etc. are listed incorrectly. it appears he's done it again. if all you need is a map and some helpful items then this book is for you. however, i wouldn't be so generous as to call it comprhensive knowledge for the game. once again, locations, items, and other general mis-knowledge comes up several times throughout this book. for a real eye-opener as to how bad the author is, play this game and read some online faqs at gamefaqs.com and compare the knowledge."
2,Disappointing,Written by a Brit so it relates to the British financial markets and reporting. Uses terms that are not as familiar to us here and makes it harder work than it should be. Would not recommend.
3,Good pen but a bit expensive.,"I bought this as a present for my hubby. It's a very nice pen that comes in a great little case if you are giving it as a present. It writes nicely.I do think it's over priced for what it is though. It's not a full size pen like I thought it would be--it's skinny and kind of short.Maybe that's how they make fancy pens, I'm not sure. I would not return it because I do think it was a good gift idea. I just wouldn't buy it for myself."
2,"Looks Great, Writes Poorly","This pen writes like a standard $0.10 bic pen. It looks very nice, but the writing quality is ""meh"" at best.I was pretty disappointed."
4,Refills vanish its quality,"I love this pen, it looks great to me eventhough it is a little bit smaller from what i expected. But what i really do not like is the writting quality of its refills wich is miserable, probably because it's produced in China. Any way this is a slim classy looking pen,which I still love"
2,Disappointing,"The price was right but this is the Cross pen made in China and it is a big disappointment. The pen looks great but it makes ink blotches as I write. If you are using it just to sign you name maybe it is okay. However, to do more serious writing don't buy this pen. Holdout for one of the older Cross pens made in the USA. It is a pity A.T. Cross outsourced their pens to China--yet another example of a once fine American made product going to China and the quality going down the toilet."
4,Atomic Watch,"It was what I expected, but a bit on the heavier side than I thought it would be. He is not sure if he wants to keep it as he would like it to be lighter."
3,difficult,"Difficult to operate and not as flexible in terms of settings, nmovement within modes, etc. instructions difficult to apply.Watch is solid and works well"
3,Fairly OK...,I bought this watch 3 months back. I did not like many things in it. It weights too much. It has some cheap plastic buttons which degrade the quality of the watch. The synchronization is also has some lag which I find annoying.The light lights up for very small time even if you keep the button pressed.All in all cheap watch....
4,This man is a real hero,"I discovered Jesse Leroy Brown, after listening to a broadcast of the Pritzger Military Library series regarding Congressional Medal of Honor recipiants. Here is a story of a man that stood against all kinds of adversity, much of which is described here, to pursue a single dream, a single ambition. To fly airplanes in service of his country. While we heap loads of praise of many other folks that may or may not deserve it. This man stands apart from most all of them.From humble beginnings in the deep south to the Ohio State University, to training in Pensacola, Florida as an aviator. And then left out of most of Naval history with exception of the naming of a ship. This young man lived much in his short life. I would reccomend this book to everyone. It ecompasses Naval and Marine history, African American history, in a year in which we keep looking back to firsts, why not look at some real firsts, and some real struggles. Jesse Leroy Brown, thank you for your service."
2,Lacked color,"Knowing the history of King Tut and viewing the exhibit, I found the film to lack color...very little time showing the artifacts. It concentrated more on the work of the discovery."
3,A story with chilling political parallels,"This is the first and only book I've read by Drury, so I had some problems with the references of the previous book(s). Once past that he weaves an interesting tale of politics that, although written nearly thirty years ago, have many parallels with today that chilled me. His definition of liberalism rings all too true. The down side of the story is, unless I'm missing something from the previous novels, is the assumption of Soviet infiltration of biological weapons would go completely unnoticed and the assumption of no general uprising of the citizenry. Some of the dialogue is a bit hokey at times. In all, a book to read if the current Administration scares you."
2,Classic Slipcovers Printed Classic Stripe...,"The instructions that came with the slip cover, were so faded I could not read them, I had to spend quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to make the slip cover work."
4,If only I could have bought Tom's hands!,"This book (songs from the Revue ""Tom Foolery"") includes all of the pieces featured in the Rhino Records 3-CD set. However granted, printed music could never fully reproduce the musicality or hone in on the complete and utter satire of Tom's own performances. That being said, having the printed music in front of one's self (especially when one is not of the species that can simply play by ear) is quite a treat - even more so when your undergraduate Adviser and Professor is also a Lehrer fan!...the drawings (of which there are truly too few) are morbid and wonderful!"
5,Commentary,"If you are a Tom Lehrer fan, this book is tops! I just wish he did not use so many sharps in his songs. The collection is more than I hoped for."
4,"Excellent book, but incomplete","If you're a fan of Tom Lehrer's razor-sharp wit and a musician, then purchasing this book is a no-brainer. That said, it is slightly disappointing -- but only slightly.As other reviewers have noted, it's missing such wonderful songs as ""Alma"" and ""Oedipus Rex,"" neither of which deserved to be cut. Additionally, ""The Vatican Rag"" lacks a section that has no lyrics, but would have been fun to play. Perhaps the most disappointing of all, however, is that ""Bright College Days"" is missing its entire middle, chopping the song to approximately half its proper length, and omitting some of the funnier lyrics!That said, the book is well worth a buy -- Lehrer makes a great addition to any repertoire."
5,Classic sardonic humor,"This book is for anyone who wants to know the words and play the music from the classic recordings of Tom Lehrer from the fifties and sixties. It may not sit on the piano very well, though spiral binding will take care of that, it will make the player a hit at a party of like minded souls. These songs are classic, and should be shared, especially for anyone who tells you that people in the past were nothing but virtuous and all social problems are modern.Also, politics has not changed at all.We knew that."
5,memories of Home,THOUGH i DON'T READ MUSIC i KNOW ALL OF THE TUNES BY EAR FROM GROWING UP WITH HIS FIRST RECORD.no Ii know which lyrics I mis remembered!
4,tom lehrer book,"good book, great choice of repertoire- his sonds are a bit grisly but perfect if you need something to wake the audience up! definitely got my money's worth."
4,This book has good selection at a good value.,"I enjoyed this book a great deal, and here is why. There are thirty-four songs of his in this book and in most of the songs the piano part is very close to what Tom Lehrer played on his albums. The book contains piano, guitar chords, and the vocal score. I highly recommend this book over the hardback book, ""The Tom Lehrer Song Book."" This other book only contains twelve songs and I believe it costs more. You will get every cent of your money's worth with ""Too Many Songs by Tom Lehrer."" The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does not have all of his songs."
3,"Not bad, but I was expecting more","I liked the book, as a whole, but if you are planning to buy it, the songs, OEDIPUS, ALMA, MAKES A FELLA PROUD TO BE A SOLDIER, CLEMENTINE are missing. Also, in MY HOME TOWN the line omitted in all recordings is also omitted. A last comment, many of the scores are different from those used by Mr. Lehrer in performances."
5,The True Scotland,"If you are going to Scotland, forget all the other travel books and buy ""Scotland The Best."" My family and I used it exclusively on two long trips to Scotland, mostly spent wandering around the Highlands and Western Isles. Irvine's book definitely has a point of view, which makes it entertaining reading. Most importantly, the reviews and recommendations are spot on. We found several places to eat, sleep and shop which no other book mentioned. And after you have visited Scotland, this is a great book to pour through as you plan your return visit (because you will go back!)."
4,"Fun,but...","I get the feeling this game could be really awesome,if I could get anywhere. This is not an easy game when it comes to advancing to different levels. As a matter of fact it can be a major challenge. The content may be suitable for 6 year olds,but as far as I am concerned they could get terribly frustrated trying to play this game,heck I'm 25 and I get extremely frustrated with this game."
4,Good pinball for PC,"I enjoy playing this a lot. It has good graphics and a lot of challenge!! It can be frustrating because there's something to be accomplished at each ""table"" before you can go to the next table and I can only get so far. Some of what you need to accomplish is easy to figure out, some is more of a challenge. I don't play it all the time (I have a wide variety of PC games I play), so I don't get too frustrated at my lack of progress. And when I do play it, I really do enjoy it. There are a lot of different things on the tables and, because it's a PC game, there are things (like dinosaurs running across the table that need to be bopped with the ball) that couldn't happen on a ""real"" table. It's a challenge and fun and I can be a really bad pinball player in the privacy of my own home! It plays on both the Mac and the MS PC, but this game I actually enjoy more on the iMac. The whole family enjoys this one, from us adults to the 8 year old."
4,Pinball For Adventure Gamers,"This is a great game. If you like adventure games, you'll love this. It focuses more on adventure than pinball. If you're a pinball purist you may not like it. As with most adventure games, once you've got to the end, and beaten it, there's no need to play it again. If you're good, you can beat this game in one day like I did. You have to make skillshots to advance to the next level. Your goal is to defeat a mad scientist that's turning cavegirls into Flying Dinos. You may end up with a headache after an all day session."
3,Navy Cross of Vietnam book,"I like it, but it has the previous owner's name on the inside cover and he wrote small tid-bits about some of the Navy Cross winners thur out the book.I used white out on all of those tid-bits and left the previous owner's name on the inside cover."
4,Job by Job in the Embassy,This book was informative. I wanted to know more about how embassies are operated internally. This book does a good job because it describes each job title in the embassy and gives you short anecdotes to explain them.
4,A good look at the working life of our diplomats.,"It is written in an interestingly simple and entertaining style. The book consists primarily of many short stories that describe a day in the life of several Foreign Service Officers, each in various parts of the world and various functional areas. I enjoy reading it and the way it is written. It is easy to travel with, as you can start and stop in the short segments, or skip to an embassy function or area of the world that may be of interest. Certainly worth it."
2,Old Edition,"While this book is alright, it is outdated and the information/ personal experiences are limited. The new edition, Inside a U.S. Embassy: Diplomacy at Work, The Essential Guide to the Foreign Service, is quite a bit more thorough and updated. Not the mention the updated edition has new cover art, and is at least twice the size.Then again this version is quite a bit cheaper so if you are looking for a quick read I suppose it is worth the whole 4 bucks. The most expensive part was the shipping."
3,Know what the format is before you buy it,"Instead of discussing how a typical embassy is organized, what role each of the officers plays in the organization, how they are assigned, chosen, rated, the book begins with two-page vignettes of people holding different positions in different embassies. You don't really get a good idea of how the embassy is run, just the duties of the PAO, the Consul, the Environmental Officer, etc. Also, the book is clearly a meant as promotional material for the State Department, glossing over current problems with visas, unstable regimes, unfair trade practices, etc.The only real laugh I got was a section about a State Department Environmental Officer discussing ""environmental issues to often skeptical audiences."" Yeah, like trying to tell natives in Greenland that global warming is real and they need to get with the program by taking those fur coats off."
5,Don't complain about a free gift!,"What a grouch! Adiegoriv is complaining about a free gift from the Department of State. If you are planning to take the Foreign Service Written Exam (usually given in April), you need this book BEFORE you take the test. It is true that the State Department is currently sending Inside a U.S. Embassy to Foreign Service Written Exam passers as a gesture to help them understand more about embassies and real Foreign Service work. My suggestion: if you get a free book because you passed this difficult exam, pat yourself on the back and give the extra copy to a friend or family member who might be interested in your exciting future career in international affairs."
4,How circumstances affect the creation of literature,"This scholarly exploration of how silence is imposed on the literary writing of those people hampered by gender, class, religion, or ethnicity was first published in 1978 and has recently been reissues with a new preface. Olsen speaks of the obstacles and frustrations faced when women and other disenfranchised people are driven to put words to paper. The fact that Olsen took 15 years to write this book, squeezing bits of time between working and mothering, goes a long way toward demonstrating exactly what she's talking about."
1,Reduce Me To Love,The book is readable but the the description said it was in good condition it said nothing about the large dry blob of gravy on the cover which looked terrible. I might not have been so mad if i was not intending to give it to a friend as a Christmas present.
5,Barcelona Mass - Song of the Sibyl,"Barcelona Mass - Song of the Sibyl is a recording under the direction of Emannuel Bonnardot who leads the Obsidienne vocal ensemble and Gisela Bellsolà on this Opus recording from 1995. To listen to this music is a testament that the mideval age was an age filled with culture, intelligence and genius and not the dark ages. Isabella Ragnard has written the liner-notes and they are a joy to read. The lyrics are in Latin, French, German and English. Highly recommended. 5/5."
5,Excellent Review of State of the Art,"There are only two books which cover the new areaof visual information retrieval. One is by Alberto del Bimboand gives a good introduction to the subject. It iswritten well, but leaves the reader wondering what thestate of the art is.This book by Prof. Lew covers the state of the art in thefundamentals of color, texture, shape, and video. Prof. Lew'sbook has each fundamental area written by the leadingexpert so the material is fresh and truly state of the art.These experts include the leading researchers from MIT,Boston University, Univ. of Illinois, etc.This is the only choice for an advanced book on visualinformation retrieval - one for graduate students orleading edge developers.- John"
1,Dry and Fragmented,"This book was quite a disappointment. The equations the author throws at the reader are extremely abstract and do not get elaborated. I don't think you will be able to implement any of these algorithms in a language like C++ because many details are missing. Most explanations are not self-contained; they usually go along the lines of ""[author] uses this function to do blah blah..."""
2,Book content obselete,"It is indeed true that this is perhaps one of very few books on this important subject. Unfortunately, the content of the book is mainly obselete. It does not contain the start-of-art work since 2000. I am quite disappointed."
4,the more than i expect,All information is very useful for me to understand.Lots of petrochemical process information is very good and valuable.Thanks so much
2,Where's the beef?,"This book was a major flop. Although there were some good one liners, for the most part the book is filled with hokey and lame nonsense."
5,The best!,"I bought three books that all just arrived. I laughed more in the first ten pages of this book than in the other two joke books combined. Plus, most the jokes are only one or two sentences. The jokes are so funny and so short they're a breeze to memorize. This is the book I've been searching for!"
1,Not so good,This is a sorry excuse for funny jokes. did not find more that three that I would use. There a re much better sources for one-liners that are good!
2,MORE MILD THAN HILARIOUS,"There are far-better joke collections available in print, for those who wish the truly ""hilarious"". Most of those in this tome, however, are merely tepid grin-makers, at best."
3,Some good nuggets in here,"There aren't as many jokes and categories in here as I would like, but the ones that are in here are pretty good. I've always liked Pat Williams, so this was pretty easy to pick up."
5,Very Good Read,"I bought this book for my son, and I ended up reading it first. I found it very informative in both aspects (Jeff's personal endeavor and the world of racing as a whole)and would highly recommend it to all."
5,Great Value,A basic unit that seems well built and is working well for me. I was looking for something simple and cheap. Very good value for the money.
4,Good quality but short cord,This is a well made hoist for the price. This one is used to tow a light aircraft into a hanger. It would be more convenient if the control unit cable were at least twice as long. I had to splice another 6-feet onto the existing control cable to make this hoist useable.
5,Lift Hoist,"As of now, I haven't had a chance to try the unit under load but in the next 2 weeks I will be putting it to the real teast."
3,"Great book, not so great recipes","I love custards and everything associated with ramekins so I was thrilled to find this book. It even has many full color photographs which make the recipes even more appealing. For the most part it introduces how to use a variety of cooking techniques associated with custard type dishes, however, some of the recipes could use some spicing up. The Breakfast Custard Omelets were practically devoid of seasoning, and the Green Tea Custard was extremely sweet. I did love the creme brulee recipe as is though. With a bit of altering the recipes turned out much better the second time around. I would recommend this book for someone who can step away from following a recipe line for line, because frankly if you don't do that not all of the dishes are that delicious. Besides the recipes needing some tweaking I loved the book's layout, organization, and clarity."
1,Awful book,"I mistakenly chose this book for my book club to read and it was unanimously panned. I hated this woman - she was mean, petty, and insipid. I finished it because I kept thinking there would be more to it. There wasn't."
1,Banal and inconsequential,"These stories are so slim and inconsequential that motivation to read on wanes fast. And the flatness of the prose style - which I suppose is deliberately naive - doesn't help. It's a dull book. The only coherence - and again, I presume this is deliberate - is in the relationship of the nonentities described to the author. This alone is not enough to carry a novel - it's a one trick pony. I struggled to care about the author (I assume it's autobiographical - no-one could create a life this boring) or the characters she meets. Sure, real life can be tedious and inconsequential, but there should be more to fiction."
4,better than the alternative,"since i am in a commited relationship with my partner and do not have to worry about the transmission of diseases, this was a great choice for me. it feels much more natural than the latex condoms and it lets a lot of the sensations come through making the experience more pleasureable. i highly recommend this product."
5,"It fits, looks identical to the original.","Looks just like the original taillight assembly. The installation is easy. It comes with the proper bulbs pre-installed, in case the ones you have are broken."
3,It's kind of psycho,"...but not quite, however that doesn't mean this album isn't good. In fact, it's full of variety, so kudos to these boys for not going the samey-route. Tracks to check out: Mortocracy Manor, Bitter End -- one for swinging, one for rocking out. It's a bit more metal than it is psycho, but no one ever said metal was bad. I'm interested to see how these lads are going to market themselves. Don't let the labels confuse you, music listeners! Keep your mind open and try not to get sucked into what is psychobilly. It is and it isn't. In fact, hard to say what this is, but at least it's fun. It won't blow you away, but you'll at least enjoy the ride."
4,An Intimate Requiem,"This is an important recording for two reasons. First, it offers a seldom heard, never before recorded version of Brahms own 4 hand piano reduction of the Requiem. Second, the choral forces on the recording are less than the normal behemoth performances of this piece. The result is a much more intimate, and at times introspective performance than what we usually get with the large chorus and full symphony versions.There are plenty of problems with the recording. Engineering is spotty and overreliant on digitalized solutions to choral problems. At times, soprano intonation goes awry, and the tempi, particularly in the first chorus, are more than out of the ordinary. But overall, the recording works. For the serious student or the person who loves Brahms German Requiem, this is a recording that should be in your library. It is delightful, unique, and offers a look at the piece that gets under the symphony, and allows for a more pure approach to the music."
5,Fantastic Watch! One Small Caveat,"This is a great watch...very much worth the price. The thing looks nearly indestructible and although it is a bit thick, still fits pretty decently on my wrist. The looks are great as well, sure to catch an eye or 2 and you can't beat a watch in this price range that's both solar powered and can receive atomic time. The one small caveat, at least to me because the pictures didn't show this, is the fact that with all the metal in the watch, the band is actually connected to the acrylic part of the watch. Again, not a big deal and it wouldn't have changed my mind had I known, but I would have preferred an all-metal construction."
1,Casio Men's Watch,"I orded this watch, and as of 6/08 have not recived it or have been refunded my money. I will never order from Amazon again. It's been almost 3 months. WHERE IS MY WATCH OR WHERE IS MY MONEY!!!!!!"
3,Poor reception,"The idea of auto adjustment is pretty neat in theory, but not the case in practice.To adjust the watch, you have to lay it flat in a place where good reception is available. I live in Northern California where there are few tall buildings. Yet the watch still has difficulty get signals from atomic clocks. So far, the watch has not been able to receive any signals indoor for adjustment.On the other hand, the watch is built like a tank. I wouldn't think twice if I need to take this watch biking or diving. Sold at Amazon for about 1/3 or 1/4 of its MSRP, it's a pretty sweet deal."
4,High Tech + Rugged,Very nice quality. Thought the Atomic timekeeping would be more of a gimmick but now I really appreciate as I never need to adjust time. I like the looks but wife thinks it is too bulky. I gave it 4 stars because the red hour hand and the small LCD windows are not easy to read at a glance.
4,Definitely a man's watch,"This is a very masculine, heavy watch.My Brother in law stated,""that isn't a watch, it's a weapon!"" The ""Pros"": Good looking, all stainless steel, Crystal is well protected by deep face, lighted dial works well, bracelet is well made with ""easy to adjust"" band, fairly easy to adjust all functions,keeps time and sets itself very well,solar feature is reliable, ""radium"" numerals and hands last through the night. The ""Cons"": The watch looks and feels heavy, The red hour hand is detrimental at times, the three ""windows"" at the bottom of the dial are fairly hard to read, the automatic light with a twist of the wrist is a nuisance at night--I switched it off, Alarm hasn't been tried so I can't comment on that. All in all, I'm delighted with the watch and for the money it's a steal !!"
4,Nice Gift!,"My husband loved his new watch. It's really nice, kind of bigger in size than he is use to but doesn't mind at all."
3,Very hard to read!,"Although this appears to be a nice watch it is very hard to read. The hands disappear against the gray background. Also, the band is huge. I had to remove two links on each side. Auto-on night light is nice, but very hard to read. Maybe I'm just blind. Great price on Amazon!"
1,NOT WORTH IT!,I will never get slip covers again. WASTE OF MONEY! I constantly have to fix them because they move around a lot. They look sloppy. I bought them because we have a dog that tends to go on our furniture when we are not looking.
4,mixng humour and trademark bop prose,"This CD has alot from the box set but selects nice short pieces which show Kerouac's funny side too. I'm from Lowell Mass and am definitely biased having read some of part of almost all of Jack's books. Jack's voice has it's own unique New England/Canuck canter and accent which you have to experience. He doesn't speak alot of Quebequa(sp?) as he does in the wonderful bootleg Dr. Sax readings, but if you can't afford the box set one of these single cd's is a great alternative."
3,Three because it's Nez,"Hey, whoever compiled this ""best of?"" Whatever happened to ""Cruisin'"" or ""Light"" or ""Rio?"""
3,A good buy if half the price,"Part of my decision to purchase this book was based on the 5-star recommendation of Robert Latino (the first Amazon.com review listed for this book). Upon receiving the book I found that Robert Latino also happens to be an editor of the book's publisher. Perhaps this is just a coincidence.The book contains valuable information and is presented in a logical sequence. Grammatical errors and run-on sentences make the reading a bit tiresome at times, but the overall message is sound. The book provides a good overview of coding, KPI's, and other maintenance processes. It's a good reference to have on hand while talking to CMMS vendors prior to developing your system's performance requirements.After spending too much... I was a bit aghast when a slim, 133-page book fell out of the shipping container. Seems overpriced, content notwithstanding. If the price was $50 I would rate the book 4 stars."
3,Jedi Sign,The sign is very nice. The size is just right to put in front of your parking space. There was a notice on the package that if the sign were bent when recieved to refuse it and a new one would be sent. That is hard to do when you are not home when the package is delivered. You can't really tell unless you open it anyway. As luck would have it mine was bent. I contacted the seller but received no reply. Since they did not reply they must not want my business so I probably will not order from them again.
3,Manic.,"Susan missed a golden opportunity to spread the message of what living a healthy lifestyle can do for America. The typefaces are unreadable. The man bashing was just rude. I know she's not going to like this but Dr. Phil did a better job with his book, The Ultimate Weight Solution. I'm giving her three stars cause I really like Susan and I think she's great at motivating people. She needs to focus the energy and put it into something precise."
4,It worked for me!,Years ago I lost 43 pounds using Stop the Insanity. I kept the weight off a good 12 years. As the stresses of life over took me I gained the weight back. I liked this book and will use it to try and lose this weight.
1,Revolutionary,"The genius in this woman is that she can take what is common knowledge and get crazy rich by dressing it up. She states the obvious - if you want to lose weight, stop eating as much, eat healthier and get some exercise. Her publisher describes this idea as ""revolutionary"". She misses the point. Americans LIKE to be fat. They LIKE sitting in front of the TV watching mind numbing shows, shoveling pizza down their neck. If they ever realize that their obesity will either kill them or make them ill, they will want to take a pill for it, because a sensible diet coupled with regular exercise is boring. Make no mistake, the obesity issue is here to stay. Over the next 100 years there will be zillions of new diets and books all saying the same thing. But it won't make any difference because the average American lacks the intelligence to care. The only way to stamp it out is to impose a fat tax. When people have to pay for their obesity, they'll think twice about that piece of chocolate cake."
3,"""So Susan, tell us what's wrong with the world.""","The most unusual of Susan Powter's books by far, The Politics of Stupid is one long stream-of-consciousness rant. There are no chapter divisions and little sense of meaningful organization. It's as if you just put a microphone to Susan's face and asked her what's wrong with the world. She insists she's not doing the ""Stop the Insanity"" thing, but of course the same passion, energy and anger are still there, as strong as ever. Susan has aspirations beyond getting us in shape. She envisions a world where women rise up, take hold of the reins and lead this sad sap of humanity into a better life for all. However, this tome is long on rant and short on useful advice. If you're serious about whipping the old bod' into shape the Susan Powter Way, start with the original book, Stop the Insanity."
2,"Sorry Susan, but this isn't a weight loss book","Let me first say i love Susan Poweter and think her energy and style are fabulous. I loved Stop the Insanity and Food, etc... liked the fat formula and i use it in daily life to make wise food choices. But this book isn't a weight loss book. Its a general rant about the weight loss industry. No fat formula, no how to make good food choices, nothing. I was sooooo disappointed in this book. Her style of writing has changed also. She jumps around alot. My advice, buy stop the insanity and forget the politics."
1,The Stupideness of the Politics of Stupid,"This book was a total waste of money. I have read many books about Obesity and this is by far the worst of the lot. Susan Powter doesn't offer anything that is slighty interesting or informative in this book. She waxes and wanes on and on about her fight with the ""man"" who kept on trying to hold her down from the dieting community because their focus was on making money. I kept trying to finish this book just hoping it might get better; well it never did. She doesn't tell you anything new or useful and does not provide any medical facts to back up any of her statements. There are so many other diet and health related books out there that are more informative and interesting - I say skip this one."
2,Susan Powter book,"I found this book disappointing. Used to love Powter, now she is just stating the same thing over and over. Nothing new and not interesting. A great disappointment."
1,Susan dear....please stick to cookbooks!,"I read this book, and yes susan lost her mind on this one, BUT her cookbook called ""cmon america lets eat"" is fantastic. I wish she would have wrote another great book like that."
1,GOOGLE Susan Powter/ Bankruptcy,If anyone wants this book then you can have my copy. Just Google her name if you want to see what a fraud she is. Even her own brother says that she never been fat. In her first book she talks about being a stripper. A fat stripper?
3,Overpriced?,"This was a Christmas gift, but when it came the tag read $29.00. I purchased on line for $35.99. Is this a rip off or what. I can't get the place I purchased it at to respond why there is such a differnce. And no it was not the shipping cost, I did look at that. Becareful when you get product to see if price you thought you were paying is right. And this company does NOT return the email when you want to get response. No, telephone number to contact either.Love the hat! But, what is the Price????"
4,An amazingly in-depth story with eye popping art,"This story is an extremely in-depth look at the human soul, the quality of mercy, and the thing that is redemption. It is an amazingly well written story, as the writer is John Marc Dematteis, one of the best writers in the industry, comic book or non. THe art is amazing, but the story could have held its own as a short story without the art. The art enhances the story, but Dematteis' work requires no assistant. The only reason I don't give this story 5 stars is that its too hard to understand/follow at times."
4,Contemporary Tabla!,"This album definitely goes to show how a tabla maestro can seamlessly infuse tabla beats with any kind of music and make it sound so great! This is personally, my first 'Badal Roy' album, but I'm definitely very, very impressed!"
1,Junk,"I have puchased three Blitz cans with three different spout designs and each one leaks worst than the other. These cans are garbage and should not be allowed on the market. I finally ended up buying a ""No-Spill"" can and it works like a dream."
1,What a mess.,Don't buy this gas can. It does leak all over the place when you go to shake up the oil and gas mixture. I was extremely ticked-off. How could a product this terrible be approved for sale. You'd be better off mixing the gas in an old bottle with a lid or something. AVOID this product.
1,"""Spill Proof"" spouts are the worst.","Back before they had ""spill proof"" spouts, I never spilled a drop of gasoline. Now, with the new improved ""spill proof"" spouts, gas pours all over the place except where you want it as soon as you start to tip the can. I can't express how much I hate this invention, or what a pain in the neck it is!Now I see that someone has posted that if you go to the manufacturer's website, read the instructions, and reconfigure your gas can, it won't spill. It still gets one star for not being user-friendly. Assuming that this is true, why don't they just sell it the way it has to be set up to not spill? It's like selling a car that's set up to crash unless you customize it first. This would make for a great class action lawsuit.I'm on the lookout for a good alternative to this if anyone has any suggestions."
1,Very uncomfortable and spills gas,"This can started to leak at the seem, hate this product. Uncomfortable to use. I lost more gas with this than with any of the container I owned before. Don't waist your money. Didn't even get one season of use out of this product. Just ordered the No Spill Can that is sold on Amazon it seems to have good reviews.No-Spill 1415 1-1/4-Gallon Poly Gas Can (CARB & EPA Approved)"
2,You get what you pay for,"There is a reason this is the least expensive can on the site. No matter which can you get you will spill some unless you are perfect at pouring every single time. This can when I have it in my garage and it's not completely full will start to slowly implode on itself as the vapors contract and expand with temperature. The metal cans never do that, or some of the other, stronger plastic cans. Talk to someone in the logging business or landscaping who use these cans constantly and ask them what they use."
2,Get a hobby!,"You should be a hype man like: Memphis bleek, Jim Jones, Or Drag-On! Because you need some serious help. I thought Cappadonna needed help but as of this reveiew he's fine, but you need to hang it up. You get a C for consistency, but even with better DJ's you still sound weak. I will admit I bought both of your CDs and put them to good use. They are now book holders on my shelf! I'll still keep buying Wu music but if you don't get better sometime soon. I'll be forced to put your music under a catagory of torture like 2 Bigg MC!"
4,Cool product,"Great product once you learn how to work with it. Best way to use it is to fill the deep scratches with the product and wipe off the excess level with the surrounding surface before it dries completely. Once product becomes tacky, polish area with the included liquid. Let product harden for 24 Hours. Polish with your favorite high quality wax. Works best on dark paint jobs; especially black. Can even be painted and sanded once completely dry. Tiny bit of Scratch X smooths everything out. I fixed a deep scratch in my fender. Works sort of like colored Bondo. You could not find the scratch unless I show you where it is. Works for me!! P.S. You won't find these instructions on the package - Personal experience. Used it on my last car many times."
3,product helps but just a little,product does help but if you looking for professional results then please hire a professional. I have a black vehicle and it was keyed two very long 2 foot scratch marks. this product did help somwehat but didnt make them go away just made the marks less noticeable
1,What a waste of money,"Definitely did not work. There were no mixing instructions, so I was stuck trying to guess what colors to put together to get dark green...which went less than smoothly. After a while I just gave up and threw the whole thing away."
3,Not What I Expected...,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas online, and when I received it, I was very surprised to find that this is not a regular art set like I had thought, but rather a bath toy. I had a spinner art set when I was younger that came with paint and papers, and it was so much fun. But this does not come with paint, it comes with soap for the bath. After looking at this item again, I noticed that if you look REALLY close at the picture, you can make out that it says ""Play Soap"", but I think they should make that clear in the product description. Some parents may like this better than the paint, because it probably makes for easier clean up, but I would have rather had the paint. I don't usually write reviews, but I just wanted other people to know what this product is before buying it, so you don't end up surprised like I did."
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed when I received this item. It is a bath toy not an arts and crafts toy. I thought I was ording a spin art set like the one I had when I was a kid. The paint in this toy is actually soap! I found the spin art set I was looking for at the Discovery store.
4,The best thing about it is you don't notice it's there,"Mostly neutral sound, good fit and finish. The one drawback is that the cable gets tangled quite easily, which can be a little annoying."
1,Doesn't Match,The cable in the display is not the same cable that I received when my product was shipped to me. The product shipped was not a coiled cable.
2,still trying to get the one in the picture,"I have already sent two back; Planet Waves should have discontinued the coiled feature on their 10-foot version, and kept the 20"" version coiled, more useful imo!I want a 20-foot coiled one like the one in the pic; they changed to a strait cable, consider yourself warned."
4,greart,"lo que queria y necesitaba, exactamente me dio las posibilidades demovilizarme un poco mas con mis audifonos y muy buena la trasmision de musica"
4,"Great coverage of some of ""The Bird's"" classics","I have been working with this book for a few months now. If you're looking to rip some licks or to learn the heads of his tunes without being able to read standard notation then this book is for you. I definately recommend a more comprehensive study of Parker's tunes if you're interested in this book, The Charlie Parker Omni book."
4,Fantastic,"A great guide to interpersonal relationships and professional image. Every professional should read it. To completely polish your professional image, a couple good etiquette references and a book on professional dress are also a great investment.One area lacking in most all general business etiquette references is a complete discussion of business meals. A lot of business takes place during meals and dining etiquette is an area that should not be ignored. I recommendEssential Etiquette Fundamentals, Vol. 1: Dining EtiquetteandEssential Etiquette Fundamentals, Vol. 2: Wine Selection & Etiquette. They answer every question I ever had and even answered many questions I did not even know enough to ask.Professional dress is another important area. For men,Dressing the Man: Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashionis a great book to read to learn more about dressing well. Another often overlooked, but important area.Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothesis another good choice."
5,Excellent material for up coming exec's,The book has excellent insite into everyday occurances that most people take for grant or just not aware of. I enjoyed the writing stlye of Camille and Stephanie. I also am looking for information on Camille's practice in New York. I would like to visit her and more personal review of my career tracks and what are my blind spots so that I can soar with The Eagles.Scott MinorLotus account Executive
4,Only 3 seconds,"This booked helped me changed my mind on how I presented things. After implementing some of the strategies, I think I turned out to be a better listener which worked to my advantage. I picked the book and I think I put it down only once before completing the book altogether. Very engrossing. I enjoyed reading this book."
2,Blink and you'll forget it.,"This book was a disappointment because if does not offer anything new, just basic common sense. In many ways it is just a re-hash of similar books and magazine articles."
2,Complicated & Contrite,"If you are an average, down to earth middle-class citizen, this book might not be for you. I'm a working class girl and bought this book to check into making better impressions, both at work and socially. I found this book marketed toward upper level executives, CEO's and high-level management types. Most of the scenarios (both professionally and socially) did not fit me. This book is overcomplicated and hard to read. What more can I say - waste of time."
4,"A Handook of how to fit in, if that's what you want.","I'm a non-confomist, small business owner in a town where the rich people wear shorts... Camille Lavington is not. We may never travel in the same circles... but found her experiences and examples a interesting read. If the fast track in a BIG corporation is what you want... you should read this."
1,Matias Luciano Ruiz,"This book stinks.It ads nothing new. It's hard to find someone that writes books about this matter seriously, and this one is defenetly not one of them. I strongly advise you not to buy this book, trust me it stinks."
2,Looking for simliar book,"I found this book while trying to find a book I first heard about in the early 80's. I believe the title was something like ""Contact: The First Three Seconds"". I'm hoping someone will read this and assist me with the actual title and/or Author of the book."
5,EXELENTE,"EL PRODUCTO ES DE BUENA CALIDAD, ES EL MISMO QUE PEDI PARA MI AUTO, LO RECOMIENDO, EL TIEMPO DE ENVIO ,EXELENTE"
5,Great Book,"If you are a fan of Chet Atkins and/or Guitars, this book is a must have. You will keep it in a handy place, so you can pick it up frequently."
5,Amazing,"This book is beautiful. I wanted to walk through the gardens and enter the homes. It provided valuable information, instructions for creating comforting retreats in your own yard. Its a pleasure to read. I loved it."
5,Wonderful Arts and Crafts Representation,"This book is a wonderful representation of Arts and Crafts Gardens. I'm a little prejudiced since my cousin John Zanakis' home is one of the Gardens displayed in this book. However, even if he didn't show his home and garden, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in this Era of Americana. Very beautifully displayed, designed and written."
2,Bungalow Gardens,"I was a bit disappointed by the quality of photographs in this book. They are not sharp pictures and I found the examples of gardens less than interesting. I was hoping to obtain some great ideas to incorporate into my own gardens, but nothing jumped out at me. Nice book, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. You can borrow mine!"
4,Great translation of a work of wonder,"I've read two translations of Popa's works. Some individual poems were in both collections. This translation was far better--more poetic. The other may have been more literal, I don't know (it's called ""Collected Poems""). This one appears to reflect the poet's feelings. It's quite beautiful as well as frequently profound. I discovered Popa by listening to the C.G. Jung Institute of Chicago audiotape, ""The Yawn of Yawns: On the Psychology of Revelation--An Exploration of the Poetry of Vasko Popa"" by Josip Pasic. The tape's catalog description states: ""the work of te great 20th century Slavic poet...talks about the most basic geometry of the human mind--the archetype of archetypes."" It's great. The translator has done a wonderful service to the English reading public."
4,Read this book WITH your kids,"The title of this book introduces it as ""the inside scoop on 50 art masterpieces"". Rather than gaining an inside scoop, I found myself introduced to art which I was unfamiliar with, as well as a reintroduction to many pieces I had seen before. The writing style is clearly geared for adolescents / middle school students. As one who has not had much exposure to art I did find this book an enjoyable, easy read. I think the book could best be used to introduce school age kids (or middle schoool kids) to the world of art. When my children get old enough, I plan to read this book with them."
4,Fascinating book!,"I enjoyed this book as much as my kids. I bought it for them so that we could study Art along with our World History studies, but the book isn't just for small children. It was easy to read, but had plenty of detail."
3,UFO Strangers in the night W.G.A. DVD,"Hi,first of all I agree with another reviewer that the only good part about the DVD was the bonus songs I knew it sounded too good to be true,thinking they would show the whole concert of strangers in the night,It's just too bad that after all these years nobody has been able to come up with a decent DVD capturing all that great music that michael schenker has given us,with all this technology so advanced we the real true fans have to settle for this,Now is the time to really dig in to the past and bring out all that musical treasure that is buried somewhere and show who the real axeslingers are,I've seen all the guitar players that replaced michael,and UFO was never the same again to me that was the end of UFO,Vinnie Moore is probably the best they'll ever get,there will never be another MICHAEL SCHENKER ROCK ON! (Long time UFO $ MSG fan)"
2,What a disppointment,"All I can say is thank goodness for Netflix. I'm glad I rented this instead of just outright buying it. Although it was good to see some of the older footage, I wish that it was a concert of some kind in it's entirety. As for the interviews they were boring and not very informative. Save your money."
4,michael schenker rocks,IT'S COOL TO SEE & HEAR MICHAEL SCHENKER IN THE RAW......CLIPS FROM WHEN ALBUMS WERE NOT OVERPRODUCED AND TRUE TALENT PREVAILED..............
3,"The DVD you want is ""The Story of UFO: Too Hot To Handle.""","The draw on the ""Strangers In The Night"" DVD is the Don Kirshner's Rock Concert footage. Other than that, it's a bunch of guys you've never heard of and UFO bassist Pete Way sitting around going ""Yep, Strangers In The Night was a GREAT album."" It WAS, and it still IS, but you don't need this DVD to tell you that. You also won't find the comparison between Mogg-Schenker and Van Halen-Roth to be ""news""...all of this stuff is irrelevant to the music. Get ""Too Hot To Handle"" and enjoy its MUCH hotter live footage and participation from Schenker and Mogg."
3,Leave out the interviews,Its only worth buying for the DKRC clips.The interviews were just boring rambling.
2,I should have listened to the other reviews,"I read all the reviews on this DVD, but went ahead and bought it anyway. Other than the live footage and the ""Only you can rock me"" promo video, what a waste of some hard earned cash. I know that UFO was never that big and probally needed the cash on this one, but come on. You know you are in trouble when on the back of the DVD it says that this is unauthorized. Warning sign right there. Other than 2 people they interviewed, I had no idea who these other people were. Nick Tauber (producer of Marillion's Fuguzi) and Malcome Dome is a magazine writer ot the only names I knew. Dont waste you money. But you have to wonder, if Pete Way was on this DVD, how is it unauthorized?"
2,Disaster,"I used to own a cassette of ""Stangers In the Night"" way back in the 70's. What an amazing concert in terms of vocals & riffs. This compilation is a critical review by a bunch of guys I've never even heard about - What a let down. I had hoped that this would contain the entire footage of the concert. Its Audio & video are terrible. Please checkout other concerts of UFO which are available, I'm sure they would be better."
5,More than just translations,"These poems are so poignantly rendered in the English language from the Persian, it's as if Rumi himself had traveled forward in time to rewrite them just for us. You don't have to be a Sufi to appreciate the wisdom of these words, and you don't have to like poetry to find them unbearably beautiful. This is the ultimate gift of love."
5,Breathtakingly beautiful and deeply stirring.,"These translations are the purest and the most inspiring I've seen. Let this be your source of RUMI's teachings as it is mine.""Seek not water, seek thirst.""--Rumi"
5,An exceptional read!,A well documented expose of how poorly party appointed secretaries can ruinously injure a fundamental pillar of the American Dream.
4,housing scandals !!,"No, sorry this book is not about the recent furore about subprime mortgages and ninja loans. Instead Welfeld takes us back 2 recessions ago, to the early 90s. That recession was induced by massive overbuilding. Some of which was contributed by excesses at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The narrative is quite explicit and lays no claims of objectivity. In sometimes lurid prose, Welfeld gives a tale of key events in HUD and with the lobbyists that dealt with it. The story rolls from the 1960s to 1990. Reminding us perhaps that there are several ways to have housing scandals."
3,Second time around,"Some may find these stories upsetting as they are certainly NOT politically correct and have a very imperialistic view of native Africans. However, if you can get past that, they are pretty good yarns."
4,A very funny read,"I read this book while in high school (an eternity ago) and found it very funny then, probably would be funnier now with a greater understanding of humans. It is the hilarious tale of a lieutenant during the Civil War who has been tasked with moving a group of ""working girls"" from a town near an encampment and taking them down river. At each town along the way he is prevented from off-loading his passengers, and in fact has more forced on board. It as interesting take on views of the time,and a funny read."
2,Waste of money,I was disappointed in this book. It was primarily a review of carpal tunnel and the ways it's treated. I didn't find any real help here.
4,Practical and filled with examples,"Yang provides an excellent, in-depth resource for people implementing Lean Six Sigma in a service organization. The text is filled with examples that guide you toward the tools needed to start improving your processes. He does make use of some manufacturing examples, but I think on the whole the examples are relevant to service organizations. My main difficulty with the book was that he re-uses some of the content from earlier chapter as part of an overview in a later chapter. This is fine in itself, but is not entirely consistent, so it is difficult to see which steps he is proposing. He also cuts short some of the examples (e.g. detailing the first house of quality for QFD, but skimming over the second house of quality). It would be nice if there were more references throughout the book so the details of the examples can be looked up elsewhere."
4,Not The Mormon Tabernacle Choir,"This album may be a bit informal for some, but has stirred a lot of interest amongst my German and Chechoslovac neighbors. It exudes a happy spirit befitting the season it honors. Personally, the vocal performances are outstanding and the arrangements are very well done. A big 4.0! for Couch & Co."
4,German Christmas,This product was just what I wanted for my mother who has fond memories of going to church and listening to German Christmas carols when she was a little girl.
2,Not sung by a real German,"I was excited and looking forward to this CD. However, the singer is an American, singing in German. You can totally tell that there is an accent that is not pleasing to the year. There should be more disclosure about it, before purchasing."
1,christmas,These songs are from my childhood and are barely recognizable because of pronounciation and I don't mean dialect. Very poorly done but the music is good.
4,Better than what you get in the academy,"Joseph has been there and done that. The book is more useful than most of the material you get in training because it comes from an officer who has learned through trail and error what works. As a guy who spent 29 years in law enforcement interviewing people, I highly recommend this book."
5,Is your boyfriend lying?,"This book is not only a police guide but also a great window into human psychology and behavior. With chapters such as how to put the suspect at ease during an interrogation, oh, excuse me ""interview"" and how to read nonverbal cues to see if a suspect is lying, it makes me want to put at least one of my ex-es in a room with his back to the door and see if he taps his feet or averts his eyes when I ask where he was on a particular evening.The author is extremely astute about human nature and uses personal experience and a down to earth writing style that makes this book fun and easy to understand. (O.K. he likes to CAP words a lot, but it ends up being CHARMING instead of annoying.)"
3,Good But Not Great,"This is an informative, interesting book. However, the author misuses capitals to the point of being a bit annoying."
3,America & What People Will Do For Money,"The American Conspiracy was a nice book for a new author. It has an interesting view of ""backroom politics"" that many Americans think goes on (and probably does!)--and a look into what the average guy (or gal!) will do for money not to pay taxes (isn't that the best part?). Overall, it was a great attempt for a 1st novel--and would look forward to reading any additional work that J. Perry would write.I received a complimentary copyof "" The American Conspiracy"", as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit Dorrance Bookstore on the Internet to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
5,Effective prayer,"Ron Mehl's books are great! This one gives you a new look at prayer: walking in integrity, listening, and looking beyond the circumstances to Jesus. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to walk in miracles."
5,Generic praise,"This is a good keyboard extension cable. Makes my computer much more user friendly. I'm glad I found it, because my computer setup has soooooo many wireless gadgets; signal interference is bound to happen. Between a wireless internet connection, a wireless mouse, a wireless phone, adding a wireless keyboard into the mix would probably lead to disaster. This product is a very good, very affortable, and very smart answer to a wireless world. Because there is no interference found in a direct connection, for any device! Plus I get to use the OEM keyboard that came with my computer; which is much much much better than anything I've found in the electronics aftermarket."
1,Not worth it,"I got the same info - for free - googling. It's a bunch of website addresses, and trial versions. Not really worth a darn, the googled sited were updated - the book is a rotten banana. Sorry."
2,Awful,"Purchased last month. All instructions followed to the letter but virtually no AM signals and terrible battery life. A fresh battery and recharge, again following all instructions but still awful. Possibly due to the area of use but many other 'non-solar' products have worked. If you live near a coastline, try something else. It's too bad too because it is a pretty nice unit."
1,Not her best work....,"Brianna is studying to be a healer. ""Sammy"" Bergen is a biker. When Sammy begins hearing a mysterious 'singing voice' he thinks he's gone crazy. Instead, he's listening to Brianna, a 9th century Irish maiden.I wanted to like this book. I'm a fan of Sizemore's modern novels. But I just had trouble getting into this one. The writing seemed amateurish, and I had difficulty taking the hero ""Sammy"" seriously. His name (Sammy) seemed like the name of a little boy rather than a big tough biker. Also it was a little too 'light' for my tastes. I prefer more depth and historical accuracy in the books I read.This might appeal to those who like light historical romance. But for me, I found it onerous."
4,Stretch Gaucho Pants with Banded Waist from Hot Fash Shorts - SALEEN Black,These capris are fun and airy. They work great for dancing at the club.Very confortable and fits well.
2,Not Worth $30,"Cheap material, very thin material. Pants started to pill after one wash. Love the length of pants but that's it."
1,Needs Better Palns,"This book is spoiled by poor plans for the projects. Here is an example: for the fire wood brace the cut list say 4 legs 3/3""x5-1/2""x36"". So, should this board be a, say, 2x4, or maybe a 1x12. The book dooes not include this information on any of the projects."
3,Basics of the Pit fighting system,"This is Chuck Liddells whole game plan, not bad for beginners. Also Hacklemans jokes actually are funny. Good for someone who just wants to know a bit and not overwealmed with too much."
3,Not bad.,"This video was OK. They showed a bunch of techniques but nothing out of the ordinary. If you have trained anywhere for about 6 months, then you know all of these.Buy it if you just want a Chuck Liddell video, which is what I wanted. They spent plenty of time promoting stuff like the gloves and pads. You could tell a few times that they don't actually use that equipment. They were just throwing it in for the money."
2,it's ok..,"i read this for an hour. read, 'compact guide to the christian life' by karen lee thorp. it's much better/clearer."
2,Don't be tempted by the cuteness....,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but after the trouble I've had with this model, I felt compelled to warn people. I had to exchange it once. After that, I had to mail order 3 decanters because they break if the wind blows, the plastic on the basket holder broke, so I had to buy that as well. If you pack the espresso tightly, the water will come out the top. Customer service is useless. Parts are expensive and hard to find. I spent more on parts than the machine. Ugh!"
4,Great Cappuccino Maker pays for itself in 5 Uses!,"I bought this machine from Walmart for about $25.00 last December, and after I used it 5 times (10 cappuccinos) it had more than paid for itself. What fun it was to be my own Barrista at a fraction of the price! The only problem I found is that it only lasted about 8 months or about 160 uses. The clip to hold the filter in the basket broke 1st, then the inner clips on the carafe broke off, and finally the steamer nozzle degraded badly. BUT-We used it to death, and it more than paid for itself! Someone told me that Mr. Coffee would have replaced parts, but I didn't try, I just tossed it. It's a great starter model before investing in a more expensive model."
5,Making Peace With Your Past by Bloomfield,Very readable and user-friendly. All the information is well founded and I highly recommend it.
1,I am very disappointed.,I have used Casual for many years and I absolutly love it. But this recent bottle that I received was old and and the perfume fluid had turned yellow. I can't use it this way because it is too strong and the wonderful aroma it usually has is totally gone. I am very disappointed that I have wasted money on an old bottle. Please reply.Thank you very much.Patricia Partridge
3,"Buy it if you like flowers, not for Diana info or pictures","Paul Burrell wrote the forward, mostly about how she liked Kip's flowers. Mr. Dodds writes brief sections about his own background or something about how he met the Princess and the floral work he did for her. You will also find short(helpful only to those who already know what they're doing) bits about doing arrangements for yourself, the beautifully done pictures tend to reflect this as you will find only one of Diana on the last page."
3,Reg DVD,"why isn't this movie & its sequel on reg DVD format?i haven't watched any of them yet, so can't really give it any star rating."
3,Easy to Operate,"As a first-time stove operator, I was a little intimidated by the whole propane/stove/flame thing. Turns out that I had nothing to worry about- very easy to use. The instructions that came with this stove were thorough, although they don't tell you *how* to do a leak test (use soapy water on all the connections, listen and smell for escaping gas). I had the whole thing hooked up and running in less than 5 minutes- including reading the directions. The ignition button worked great the first time, and I liked the compact way that the stove folded up. The reason I'm giving it three stars is because the latch that keeps the stove folded has never worked properly. The plastic latch doesn't catch, and the stove falls open when you're carrying it. I've had to put a piece of tape on it to keep it closed. Anyone else find a better solution?"
4,Go camping,"The Coleman instaStart is just rigth for most campers, RVers, or just on the Lake or Beach. No matches, the side wings block the wind and when you are done, it folds like a brefcase and stores easily. I looked all over and Amazon had the BEST DEAL !"
5,Good car camping stove,"Great stove for car camping. Easy to set up and light. Flame controls are a little finicky but I have yet to use a portable stove without that issue. The locking mechanism on the front of the stove is my only complaint as it seem like something that could break very easily. However, if it did break there is plenty of room in that area to rig some sort of lock. Ordered from Backcountry.com through Amazon and had excellent customer service throughout."
1,"If you hate flimsy, avoid this stove!","After reviewing the positive entries for this product on Amazon, I gave the OK for the wife to buy this unit.Coming home that day, I found far less than what was expected. The construction of the unit was flimsy at best. The red latch clip, made of cheap and bendable plastic had nothing to grip on the thin metal wall of the stove, resulting in the unit opening when held by the handle. All parts would then spill out on the ground. The wind shield easily slipped out of position, and the overall weight and heft of the unit left much to be desired.The instastart functioned well, and the grill portion was good weight steel. The gas manifold was a separate piece, and the unit lacked a secure attachment point for the gas cylinder on the stove itself, leaving the gas cylinder loose and requiring a larger surface area to balance the entire unit.I returned it the next day, and bought a cast iron two burner from another vendor."
3,Knobs spring back,"I like the design of the stove and have not had any problems with the latch. The ignition did stop working after a while, which is annoying. Though I must say that the stove is pretty filthy after a few camping trips and maybe a good clean may fix that.The thing that has made me decide to stop taking this stove camping is the knobs. You turn the burner to low and when you let go of the knob, it springs back and the flame goes higher again. I managed to burn the rice because of that and I'm a rice cooking expert! Because I used a higher flame than needed lots of the time, the stove also used heaps of gas.Those cheap one burner butane stoves give you much better control of the flame."
4,Good for Car Camping,"This is a great camp stove for those wanting to do some ""car camping"". Easy to set up and the flame is strong. Only concerns are that controlling the flame is a little difficult, and lighting the stove using the pezio start can be tricky. Basically just barely crack open the gas or you won't get the correct air / gas mixture needed for ignition.I attach a 4 foot hose and a small 5 pound LP tank to mine for camping and it works out great. Will last the better part of the summer season."
4,Storm Sandy promted me to buy this.,No electric for cooking for 7 days after storm Sandy visited NJ. I will be eating hot food next storm.
2,insta start doesn't work,"After using a friend's earlier version of this product for several years and being impressed by how the insta start was convenient and worked every time, I decided to shell out the extra $20 to get the insta start when it was time for me to buy a stove. Big mistake. Whatever ""improvements"" Coleman has made to this product over the years, it has managed to convert a useful feature to a useless one. Now, the insta start works about 10% of the time, mostly after the burner is still warm from prior use."
4,Good relation price - value,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received the stove due to the materials and quality stand at first sight perhaps it should reviewed the stove's weight, try to lighten it as well as the design of the knobs. It should be careful to connect gas because any detail ends in a leak, perhaps could to improves the system of gas connection"
3,"Buy the cheaper Coleman stove, InstaStart doesn't work","Our friends have the same stove. On neither stove does the ""InstaStart"" system work. You can press the button a hundred times with the propane on high and it just does not light. Coleman either didn't test this system or didn't care to fix an obviously broken product, which bugs me.Other than InstaStart, it works fine. I'd recommend getting the cheaper Coleman propane stove and a ""utility lighter""."
2,Look for a better value,"I normally like Coleman products and have owned quite a few. This stove seems ""cheap"" in construction, more like a toy, I found a better value with another brand."
2,Caution: Item contains lead,"Unless you see the box, you will not know that the item contains lead; a hazardous and cancer-causing substance. If you plan to have kids, it's even more dangerous. Lead has been shown to cause birth defects.It's sad and shameful that an American institution like Coleman would resort to using lead in their products. Of course, that's a trend and bandwagon that a lot of unscrupulous companies are jumping on. Putting profit over safety. A lot of companies are putting their own interests above their customers. Beware.There is another Coleman product though that is similar, but a one-burner design. That one doesn't seem to have the issue and warning."
4,"pros outweigh cons, esp. controls far from heat","Thank you to the reviewer who pointed out that this stove's controls are on a large, cool handle, far from the hot metal. That was what convinced me to spring for this product over the cheaper version without InstaStart (you can see in the photos that most of the stoves have controls close to the heat). The InstaStart feature itself isn't worth the extra cost, because as others have noted, you often need to press the ignition several times -- it would be just as fast and easy, if not easier, to use a lighter (at least for the casual weekend camper who doesn't mind packing one more small product). I had better luck controlling the flame than some reviewers, and felt there was a real difference between the highest and lowest flames, even if the range and control aren't as great as on a kitchen stove."
1,Does NOT work as second monitor adapter,"Bought this to add a second monitor to a small, brand new Lenovo. After several hours of frustration and a few calls to Lenovo, it was not working at all. Lenovo eventually claimed it wasn't an actual Lenovo part (I read him the stock item number, which, in IBM/Lenovo-speak is called a FRU. ""What's a FRU?"" asked one support agent).The system would not even recognize it as being installed. I returned it and bought a low-profile dual-monitor video card which worked out of the box.If you have a DVI monitor, spare yourself the headache and just get a DVI converter for a fraction of the price and you won't even have to open the computer. If you want a dual monitor solution, get a standard video card. You may need to detach the VGA connector, but it will fit."
1,Sounds better than it is !!,"This Lenovo solution is not what it is advertised as. I bought this for my ThinkCentre M5x series. It does not fit. The height is too big which makes me think I was shipped a PCI card vs. a Mini PCI perhaps. Either way, it does not fit what it is sold to be used for. I cannot return it now - since I passed the refund window. So, I have learned a lesson."
2,not as pictured,"good color, ok size. Pattern not centered, a-symmetrical, falling off one side.Will probably take to Goodwill. Not worth cost to return."
3,If it's what you need...,"It fit and it worked. For less than five bucks I can't really complain - but it lasted about a year, which is why I hate these stupid little custom battery packs. Lots of newer phones use AA rechargeables - look for that when you're ready to replace the phone."
3,Delivered on time,Is delivered faster than I expected. The product was not quite what I was looking for but still works for another one of my Cross pens. I was looking for the replacement for the cross pen three filler miniatures.
4,pencil refills,product took a little longer than expected to be shipped but that was probably because of the holidays. very fair seller
5,Excellent layout in images and text,"Cyril Aldred does an excellent job in both his fairly extensive text and the recreations of the surviving ancient images (some are more interpretive than originals) of Tut. ""His Friends"" is an odd concept since we know relatively little about this boy king who gave up the religious changes of his predecessor and died young without an heir. These are mostly relatives and advisors, not really friends."
3,Bakeware or Fakeware?? 10 or 3 Piece ??,"Kaiser should call this a 3 piece Bakeware Set, not 10. The Bakeware itself is great but the utensils are useless. Wooden spoons, spactula, etc splinter after first use & pastry bag is a waste. But if like me, you are buying because you love the non-stick, even baking that come with a name like Kaiser, then this is a nice starter set. I've used all the pans many times over and they look like new, just don't be fooled into thinking you are getting 10 pieces of Kaiser when you are getting 3!"
3,Missing pieces,"The pans look good, just received the set today, but most of the other items are missing from the box. I am now wondering how long it will be before I get my replacement set or pieces.Otherwaise a good deal (bought on the today's deals for half price"
1,very disappointing,"Although this book is ""fiction"", it is loosely based on an actual case which occured in Michigan. The potential was there for an excellent story, but the author unfortunately didn't take the time to edit the book very well. His use of pseudonyms for the characters would have been fine, except he couldn't keep the names straight, which made for a very confusing read, even for someone familiar with the case. For example, the medical examiner was referred to by three different names; Dr. Merritt Blanchard, Dr. Stephen Blanchard and Dr. Warren Blanchard. This is just one example of many throughout the book. Also, there were several instances where the pseudonym was dropped and the real name of the character was used, then the pseudonym was used. Just made it very hard to follow. I wouldn't recommend spending the $17 on this book-it's not worth it."
3,Super Cute!!!!,"I like the costume, but it is soooooooooo short I am in no way conservative and I am wearing it out to the club for halloween, but this is like a T-shirt short. My whole behind is out!!! I will have to buy some shorts which I would have anyway, but it doesn't look like a dress at all."
2,NOT WORTH IT!,"I got this costume for Halloween and thought that it looked really cute on the model, however, I wish I had listened to the reviews I read because this costume was beyond short. I thought that it would be longer on me than the model because I'm only 5'3"" but I couldn't have been anymore wrong. I could put this on with jeans and wear it as a t-shirt. Every woman doesn't use Halloween as her excuse to slut it up, and it's not enough costume for the cost. I wore leggings and spanx with the costume and it ended up being ok, but I would have returned this costume if I had been able to. I almost ended up missing out on Halloween because it was so ridiculously short and I didn't want to go out in public in it. If you're an exhibitionist then this is definitely the costume for you. If you're not one of those women who wants to look like a complete slut on Halloween, don't buy this!"
2,Not so Happy Halloween...,"This is a long shirt. This item can in no way be considered a dress. The quality of the material is fine, but the sash and the dress are just not as pictured. I am very disappointed. Too close to Halloween to find a new one, and the item is non-refundable."
1,Was not a hit.,"Sometimes a gift works with a youngster, sometimes it doesn't. My wife saw a youngster very taken with this item in an airport. I hoped for the same reaction with someone I gave it to. That did not occur."
5,Simple toy that actually gets played with!,"Our 6 year old son got this for Christmas. It's very well made, comes with two teams and 1 referee, 2 goals and a large felt-like football field play mat. He likes playing against a friend or one of us and will play by himself as well. He likes to act out plays he makes up or ones from games he has watched. Its a very well-made, simple toy that comes with its own storage box."
5,Awesome toy,"My grandson and his friends love this toy. i ordered it for my younger grandson, too. They are four and six years old. I highly recommend it. I also got the baseball version for future gifts."
3,Ok I guess,"Ok I guess. Just what you think it would be. The down linemen seem to fall over easy. Would rather have got the electric vibrating game instead. Although they had poor reviews, at least they do something after you take the time to set all the players up."
3,Cute for imaginative play...,but probably takes two kids with great imaginations. My grandson hasn't taken them out of the box since Christmas. Maybe soon?
3,"Good figurines, cheaper accessories","We bought these for my 3 year old son. He really enjoys playing with the figurines. The goal posts don't stay up well and the felt field is cheap. He likes to set the guys up and have a game. Overall, not too bad."
4,more than just a figure,"Purchased these as a gift for a ten year old boy who just getting into football. He is a huge Patriots fan, so the colors were perfect. Also got him The Everything Kids' Football Book: The all-time greats, legendary teams, today's superstars--and tips on playing like a pro (Everything Kids Series)book. He was able to practice plays he learned about in the book with the figures and then tried them out at flag football practice. The only downside was that his two younger siblings thought the figures were great too and kept stealing them to play with."
1,Child not satisfied with this toy.,"I bought this gift for a 7 year old football-loving boy. He did not like it because the kneeling players would not remain as positioned on the felt mat, they kept falling over. It was very frustrating for him, he finally just gave up. He was not satisfied with it's manufacture so I wasn't satisfied with my purchase."
2,Mango Habanero Sauce,Not as good as the product I was looking for. Ginger added gives a taste I am not used to and so I did not enjoy as much as I thought I would.
1,Blah!,My family loved the Raspberry and Blueberry sauces so when I saw this one at the store I just had to try it. What a disappointment! I marinated chicken to grill and everyone agreed it was bland and blah. I've heard that you can mix the sauces with oil and vinegar to make salad dressing so maybe this would be okay on a salad but it's flavor isn't stong enough to stand up to chicken. I'd say skip this one and buy the Raspberry or Blueberry ones instead!
4,Purchase them before :),I really like these; they are sturdy and work in the microwave very well. I only wish there was a container one size larger.
4,Ekonomik Check Register DD,"I've been using the Exonomik (that's how it's spelled) DD Check Register for years. The design is good, so they never change it. Even though I pay my bills entirely online, I still like to use this check register to record and distribute my expenses. I'm an Accountant and don't feel that you need a program like Quickbooks or Quicken unless you are in business. Those programs give you a lot of information that you don't need to have. By the way, I'm in business myself."
4,Excellent Tool for Bookkeeping,I bought this register to help with the administration of a trust after my mother-in-law passed away. This register is excellent: check register on one page and the opposite page on the left is for breaking the check amounts into various categories. My only change would be to number the lines so it is easier to go back and forth across the category and register pages.
1,WET FEET,I am on my second pair of these boots both sets have started leaking with in two or three months. Have had good luck in past but they must of made a bad batch. Even though they have taken care of the last two sets its not worh the time to mess with them time to change brands
1,one hit wonder,"LE GROUPE THE TOURISTS QUI ÉTAIT COMPOSÉ DE DAVE STEWART ET ANNIE LENNOX,N'ONT EU QU'UN SUCCÉS;I ONLY WANNA BE WITH U."
2,You get what you pay for,"Things to know about this holster:* The belt clip is so stiff/tight it won't slip on my belts without leaving marks on the belt. I can barely open the clip using two hands.* The closure is VELCRO, while I was looking for magnetic.* The construction seems solid--good stitching, belt clip seems to be attached very well.* It's advertised as having a soft fabric inside, but it's more leather-like.* There's a slot inside for money or credit cards, but using it will certainly scratch the phone over time because the phone rubs against items in the slot.* Only a naked iPhone 4 will fit--no bumpers, etc."
1,Not as Expected ... Does not fit on iPhone,Went to account history and reselected same item as previously bought. That one fit fit the iPhone.This NEW model DOES NOT. The phone barely fits w/o a shell on it and it had to be wedged into the case.Waste of money. Look somewhere else if you have an iPhone !!!
4,dlo holster for iPhone,"Good product, this is my second one (the velcro wore out after 2.5 years of use on my first). Only complaint is that the leather doesn't seem to conform to the shape of the iPhone as well as my first one. This one seems to leave a little extra space on the edges. Not the fault of the seller, it's a manufacturing thing, but still a little irksome since my first one fit both my 1st Gen iPhone and my 3Gs really well."
1,Clip tears in back!,"I've had this case for just over 6 months with average use like anyone but now have to replace it due to the belt clip tearing away from the back. I can see now how that would happen since its just very cheaply made with cardboard under the ""leather"" back. Should have been made out of plastic for a stronger support where clip attaches. Do not buy unless you plan on replacing it twice a year."
1,Clip is no good,"Beautiful case, but the clip is just no good. My iPhone jumped off my belt in this case five times before I gave it up and ordered a different case elsewhere. I tried it on four different belts. The iPhone is too valuable and expensive to risk on a weak clipped holster. I recommend against this case."
3,"Good, but....","Great price, good looking, great service. The ""but"" comes from clip, it is too stiff and that makes the holster too hard to clip to he belt. For the price (about $11 including shipping), I can live with it, but would have been great if the clip worked as well as my original $34 holster that I bought at the apple store.One design improvement that I would like in future designs is the ability to charge while in holster, As it is now, I need to take the phone out of the holster to charge."
2,My phone was broken while in this case. :(,"I handed my daughter my iphone when I needed a hand free to get her little brother out of his car seat. I thought that would be fine for just a second, especially since my phone was in this case. Thanks to the cut away corners and a five-year-old, I need a new phone. I did give the case an extra star for being well-made and helping my phone to survive in a home with two young children for 14 months, but I'm still disappointed."
1,Good.......But,I have had this my second DLO case for approximately 6 months. The belt clip on the original case sprung within 30 days. Since it was within warranty they replaced it. The same thing happened to the replacement case but DLO would not replace it because it had been replaced once. Terrible workmanship.
2,Great holster until the clip and case separate,"I have had this holster for several months and very much enjoyed it. It looks good, feels good, and holds the iPhone securely. The clip is a touch difficult to get onto a belt but that's really a plus since it will almost never fall off.Unfortunately after just a few months the case separated from the clip. They are lightly stitched together and regular use is simply too much for it.I would gladly buy this again if they fixed the connection between clip and case with something stronger."
2,belt clip needs reinforced leather,the leather wrap on the belt clip has worn out. now the metal belt clip shows and the worn out leather pieces are unmanageable. now I'm looking for a new one. otherwise the case was quite functional.
3,DLO holster review,"Good overall case for iPhone 3G. Only complaint is since designed to be used on right hip, counterintuitive insertation of iPhone takes a while to get used to."
4,Good product,"This does just what it claims. It seems durable.Of course nothing lasts forever, but this should last a long time."
4,Very Nice Holster,The DLO holster is the one I rely on for my iPhone. I especially like the pocket inside. I use this to hold my hotel key. The leather is soft and holds up pretty well. I wear it every day in all kinds of conditions so I am very hard on them. I get around two years out of them. I'm able to fit my iPhone 4 in it though it is a little tight at first until it stretches out. I like that I can use the phone with headphones and the opening that allows me to easily lift the phone from the holster.
1,Don't Even Bother,"There are so many better options out there than this case. First, notice that the corners are completely open, which means that if this accidentally unhooks from your pants (which is shockingly easy) you had better hold your breath that your phone doesn't fall on the corner. Mine did, and it has a rather large dent, which voided my warranty. Further, I found that the Velcro closure came open frequently, often allowing my phone to flip out and fall, completely unprotected, to the ground.I was highly disappointed in the performance of this product and credit it with the failure of my touchscreen, which broke after the phone flipped out from the case. $199 dollars lighter and a new 3G later, I have learned my lesson. Go for the Griffen Elan Form or something similar that hugs and protects the phone tightly. Add on a screen protector and you are in much better hands. Don't waste your money on this case unless you want to be back at the Apple store with a voided warranty."
3,Great Case but the Belt Clip lasts 6 months then goes bad.,"I love the DLO case, it fits my iphone perfectly and is very convienent to use, but as I read in other reviews (which I ignored), the Belt Clip does indeed go bad after about 6 months. It tears away from the leather backing and then the phone can just drop off your waist. Because of the really good padding on this case you may not even know that it dropped and some lucky person walking behind you will get a free Iphone.I am on my Second DLO case so this is not some unlucky fluke, there is a defect in the way the Belt clip is bonded to the leather case and believe me when it starts to rip away its only a matter of days before the phone and leather case fall away from the clip."
4,Does exactly what is it supposed to do.,"I have had the product now for about a month and honestly, I have absolutely no complaints with it. It works the way it should, it is small and doesn't get in the way and just simply, does what it is supposed to do.It allows for easy access to the phone and to the headphone jack.Great product and I would recommend to anyone."
2,Nice Case but failed after 1 months use,"iPhone fit perfectly, convenient to use, but belt clip tore off after 1 months use. Getting in and out of car too much for case. If removed from belt prior to entering/exiting car should last longer."
4,One of the best,"The leather is soft and supple yet the case feels very firm and protective. Initially you will find the fit a little tight, but that gets adjusted soon enough.No idea how long the leather covering the clip will last (I tend to have those peal off over time in previous holsters.Highly recommended."
4,iphone case,"I was looking for a specific type of iphone case that would allow headphone use while the phone is cased. Knowing in advance that I was going to apply A full phone protection material in addition to just the case. So, the openings aren't A problem to me. This case is the perfect choice. Looks and performs excellent for my needs. the only reason I gave it only four stars is that the fold over secures with Velcro. In the past I have seen most Velcro applications wear out over time. We'll see what happens with this one. Other than that, so far so good.TSD"
4,"Good Quality, decent price.","I picked one up at the AT & T store. I would prefer a ""gel"" or ""skin"" for my iPhone, but AT & T didn't have one in stock, and I was tired of not having a suitable case. The leather case fits well, and keeps the phone postioned vertically so it's not too bulky if you wear it as a belt clip. It's not too bulky for just sticking in my purse."
1,poor quality,The belt clip ripped within days with only light use. The velcro is noisy and the open ends are of concern.
3,iPhone case well constructed but won't fit iPhone 3Gs with inCase slider,A very well constructed case but it won't fit the iPhone 3Gs if your iPhone is encased in an inCase Slider as mine is.
1,Bad Quality,The belt clip on the back of this holster just came off one day. I just didn't understand how that could have happen.
1,Looked Good But Didn't Last,I bought this case when I bought my iPhone less than three months ago. I was walking thru my house and the case hit the floor. The glue that holds the clip to the case separated. Luckily my phone didn't break. DLO won't replace this case. They have no warranty. Buyer beware this is a cheap case and not worth the money.
1,tight squeeze,Waste of money...doesn't really fit the iphone as described. REALLY tight squeeze and have to fight with it to pull the phone out of the holder.
2,Nice Case but major flaw with the leather covered belt clip.,"I really like this leather case but find one major flaw with design. The leather-covered belt clip fits tightly over a belt but if clipped just to a pair of pants without a belt the case would occasionally fall off of my pants. I actually stopped using this case because I frequently do not wear a belt and the case pulled off of my pants numerous times, especially when sitting and wearing a jacket."
3,A Bit Small,"I like the DLO Leather Holster Case for iPhone, however, if you have a protective case on the iPhone, it's a very snug fit; so snug that one can't easily insert and remove the phone. I resolved this problem by using Kiwi shoe stretch. I placed the phone in the case and sprayed the shoe stretch and left overnite about three times and now the case is large enough to easily place and remove the iPhone."
1,"Nothing great, wears out, smells odd.","This is the first holder I purchased and favorite for awhile. While I found it useful, it quickly wore down.PROS:* Easy Access* Could hook up earbuds with little problemCONS:* Velcro and Leather wears quickly (4-6 months with frequent use)* No swivel* Partially protected corners MAY prevent damage if dropped, depending on how it lands and what it lands on.All in all it's not the worst product, but there are far better and more flexible options available for an iPhone."
2,If only it were more durable,"I bought one of these with my iPhone and was very happy with it for a few weeks, until the the belt clip tore out when I caught it against something. The leather ripped and the item was ruined. But the design was so convenient I went out and bought another one. Despite greater care, the clip has been gradually tearing again, to the point where the iPhone case dangles from the clip. It's only been a couple months.I would love a sturdier version of this product, but unless you're handy with superglue or leather stitching and don't mind doing frequent maintenance, this product is liable to have to be replaced every few months. I'm still looking for the perfect iPhone holster."
1,i dont understad,"At today i dont receive my purchase of a leather holster case for iphone, and i dont understad why."
1,Ummm love the sleek look but it broke on me just 4weeks in..,Like the clean sleek look but didn't last it broke in 4 weeks will not buy again...
1,Assistant Principal,I complain about the holster and you were polite to have another one out to me but it was broken also. I chose not to complain again. Thanks for being courteous to send me another one. If you want to send another one after you check the product out I will accept. This product the clip is not secure in the holster the two that I receive had the same problem. The first one you send out the velcow did not work. If you can tell what is the fix for the clip so that my phone don't keep falling off of my side I will try it.Thanks
2,hard to get phone in and out,"1. The clip is really tight so it does fit on your belt tightly but it's also a bit hard getting it on initially2. it closes with Velcro so you can't just flip open the flap and take out your iphone - you have to tug it open; so this decreases the ""flow"" of grabbing for your phone and it may seem minor but it gets annoying after a while. In addition on this same point, the phone is *SO* snug and tight that it takes a bit of time to get it into and out of the pouch once you do open that velcro flap. The result is I just end up putting the phone in my front pocket.It's so different than the blackberry one where you seamlessly put your phone in and out of the pouch - but you can't use that with the iphone because of the magnet so don't try.Still looking for an iphone holder as well-designed as the blackberry ones but so far haven't found it."
3,Adequate,"I purchased this holster as a gift for my mother, who at the time still carried an iphone 3 and could never hear it ring. It served its purpose in that she could put her phone in it, attach it to her pants, and hear it when someone called. However, she did have to remove the case she had on the phone, which bothered her somewhat. For the price, it definitely served its purpose."
4,A Tight Squeeze,"I am pleased with my purchase. It looks good. It appears to be well-constructed. It keeps my phone secure. Ease of access is getting better with ongoing use. The velcro cover flap offers just the right amount of resistance to opening. My only gripe (to date) is that the fit and the belt clip were initially VERY tight. It was almost impossible to get the belt clip to slide over a belt. It was also difficult to get the phone in and out of the pocket. Both the clip and the pocket have since loosened somewhat, although it still takes a determined effort to get the phone out and the holster off of my belt. I suppose one could take the view that, once the phone is in the pocket and the clip is on the belt, nothing, but nothing, is going to separate me from my phone."
3,Unprotected corners,"This case kept my phone handy from my belt, but the corners of the phone are exposed when in the case. My kiddos got ahold of my phone and dropped it often enough (while still in the case) that the corners are damaged beyond repair. Easy to remove the phone, but not safe enough."
1,Poor quality,"After less than 2 months, the clip separated from the holster while I was traveling. The 2 pieces appear to only be glued together. The clip is very rusty and now the holster is useless. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Too tight for a bumper guard...,quick though not what I need for protection.wanted black got dark brownwill have to get another productwhat more can I say
2,It will be broke in a week. Sending it back now.,"I've had this product for less than a day. i have taken it off and put it on my belt maybe 3 or 4 times. The leather on the clip has already started wearing through. At this rate the metal clip will be showing through in a week. It looked to be a really nice case and sells for $20+ at the local big box store, but even at half that I expect it to last."
4,"Looks good, works good....","This DLO holster works very well and looks good. Clip is strong, accommodating both narrow and wide belts without difficulty. Velcro strip holds front flap down and is easier than a clasp to open quickly. Removing the iPhone one-handed takes a bit of getting used to but with practice can be managed easily, especially once the holster's broken in a bit and things are a little looser. It is only a horizontal holster, it cannot be rotated to the vertical position.I bought this as a replacement for my 1st holster (different brand) which allowed you to swap the holster from vertical to horizontal by moving the belt clip between 2 slots in the rear - useless, and it fell off my belt unnoticed one day. Luckily I realised within 5 minutes and was able to find my precious iPhone lying on the walkway outside my office - phew!.I much prefer this DLO style."
4,DLO Delivers a solid product,"The holster works as advertised. You have to be a little careful putting the iPhone away as you can inadvertently activate a function. After a couple of days, you get used to it. A good investment."
1,Definitely avoid this case,"I received it in an open plastic casing with no labels, the seller said this is the way DLO packages their products.The leather quality is good and the craft is fine, but there are 'Fatal' design flaws:1) The Clip is SOOOO hard, you you to really struggle to snap it on your belt.2) Only the upper part of the clip is fixed to the case body, which makes the clips very fragile and very annoying and difficult to put it on. 'This is alone a deal breaker'3) It has 'velcro' to close the case, which is not convenient at all, and I need to press it a couple of time to ensure it is fully closed.4) if you have a protective case on top of your iphone, it will barely fit.Seriously, avoid it. I tried the ""BlueHarbor Horizontal Leather Case with Belt Clip for Apple iPhone 3G & 3GS"" and I'm 100% satisfied.Good luck..MIT"
1,Never Buy DLO will go bad within 3 months!,"According to DLO customer service it is normal wear and tear to have DLO product go bad within 3 months. I will not buy another DLO product, and nobody should never buy DLO since it will break within 3 months. Remember it is they feature! Normal wear and tear will have belt clip of this case fall off in 2 months of use.It is normal, and it is not covered by warranty! Their short (90 days) warranty suggests short life expectancy of DLO products. Don't you think? However, it doesnt' matter since it is not covered anyway since it's normal to have belt clip fall off. I am waiting for a letter back from DLO stating that it is normal so I can publish online."
4,Almost perfect,"Leather is good quality, clip holds tight, enough room for the phone wearing a protective cover, Velcro closure so it doesn't wreck the screen and an inside pocket. If only the pocket were 1/4"" bigger! Have to cut my business cards to fit. Argh! Pocket does fit credit cards, but I'm not sure I want to keep magnetized cards beside my phone. Like I said, ALMOST perfect."
3,iphone case,"The case is very good. It is stylish, functional and realistic. My only concern is that one of the sides on the inside should be padded or softer to protect the face of the iphone. Also you have to take the phone out of the case to make a call. Apart from that, it's great. I like it"
3,seems durable,I purchased this case a month ago and so far so good .it seems durable however I prefer a magnet instead of Velcro for the cover .( I didn't pay attention to this ) . It clips securelyit protects my Iphone reasonably.
3,Nice but didn't fit iPhone 4,"I should have noticed this is for iPhone 3G, not 4. A friend recommended this case so I just ordered it. It doesn't fit my iPhone 4 with its bumper from WalMart. So I ordered a different case and now I'm happy. Nothing against this case though, it is well made and nice looking.Here's the one for iPhone 4: [...]"
2,"Cover doesn't stay close, bad belt clip","I had bough a similar product from ebay, and it works great. This one didn't do that good. Cover stay open. Good price compared to store's prices."
3,DLO Leather Holster,"Not at all satisfied with the shipping, it was shipped the wrong way. I did not receive the order in time for either of the events planed!! The product is fine and already had one."
5,nice protection for iPhone,"I bought this to use at my fitness center. It clips over the side of my sweat pants and is very secure. The leather is soft and protective of the iPhone. I had to remove my previous 'case' for it to fit in this case ... but that is GOOD because the iPhone fits ""snuggly"" and is very protected. It allows access for your earphone wire. This EXCEEDED my expectations! Go for it!"
1,Works great while it lasted,"With daily use with my iPhone 4, this case fell apart. Stiches came undone, ""leather"" around the clip ripped. Lining inside worn out. This is not a durable accessory."
3,Should be a magnet,"This is a well built case and does it's job just fine.The only thing I could say is that rather than velcro I wish it had a magnet holding it shut. Velcro makes some noise when I'm opening it during a meeting at work.I was concerned about it just having a clip on the back, but it's very strong and fits my belt snugly."
3,Careful with Clip,"This clip-on cost me a new iPhone when unnoticed for about ten minutes, the clip still on my belt but the phone in holster soaking in the gutter water from washing the car!I applied a generous amount of white glue to the exposed clip end, gave it 5 to 10 min to startsetting up before I crammed it back in the holster. It's been holding for 4 weeks now but I dont wear it while washing the car anymore."
1,The stitching...,The stitching attaching the holster to the belt clip came undone after a week of use. Don't buy if you are a moderate to heavy holster user.
3,DLO leather holster,"wished they had a magnetic flap, sort of noisy using the velcro in meetings, etc. Over time the velcro weakens, but holds up for a good six months."
3,One year and 8 months later...,"Maybe I'm a little picky and demanding, but I hoped my holster case would outlive my contract.And in one sense, it has... it's still on my belt. However, there are now 1/2"" tears in the leather on either side of the clip, resulting in the case flopping forward almost 45 degrees.I didn't subject this to anything beyond normal wear and tear. Otherwise, up until the last few months when the product began to tear, I had been happy with it. Easy to open, easy to access, and doesn't hide the ""nude"" beauty of Apple products."
2,Unimpressed,"Specimen I received had some shoddy stitching, and I really disliked the Velcro closure. Returned it immediately."
3,leather holster for iphone,"The leather holster is ellegant, slim, and light. I like th product. I think the product could be even better if it had a magnet instead of velcro for closing it."
2,Defective Workmanship,"I ordered this case on the advice of a friend. This is an excellent design, as it allows me to quickly whip out the phone, thanks to the center finger slot. It also provides access for the headphone jack. However, the corners are left vulnerable, not really a problem unless it falls off your belt. There's the rub. The clip on the back side quickly tears away because the stitches are not properly sown. At first I thought I just had a lemon, but now I see they are all this way. I think you will be lucky to have it on your belt two weeks before it drops off. Because of the open corners, it will break or dent a corner when it hits. Apparently customer service has not been helpful. Try for a different product."
1,Skip It,"The fit is too snug. I'm all for keeping the iPhone in place, but after trying to remove it from the holster, I nearly dropped it when it popped out. After a day's worth of use, I realized this is not the right case."
5,Everything I hoped for.,"This holster is a winner for me.It is lightweight and comfortable to wear. The finish and quality of the product is outstanding and the price is reasonable.You can feel the vibration of the IPhone through the holster and accessing the IPhone is easy.The inside of the holster provide good protection for the iphone screen.The clip is tight enough so there is no chance the holster will slipped out of your belt.Overall an excellent buyUPDATE: After owning this holder for over a year, I am still fully satisfied. There is no sign of abuse, the case is still in mint condition despite wearing it all the time and beeing attacked on a daily basis by my one year old."
1,First review but I had to warn others...,"I wanted so badly to like this case. It has a small slot to put my debit card, license, and my insurance card. And that's what I really wanted (an ""all in one on the go"" case so i don't have to carry my wallet when I go to the store)When I first had the case the phone fit snugly and worked well... UNFORTUNATELY it just started to fall apart after just a couple weeks. The clip (like many others here have said) wore away and basically ripped off. Now I have to be very careful as the phone will sometimes fall off my belt. I returned the product and got another one thinking ""okay maybe I had a lemon""... nope same exact thing happened. The leather stitching wore away and the belt clip basically fell off again. Fool me once shame on you... fool me twice shame on me. So now I'm on Amazon looking for something else that will serve my needs. If you're looking for a hip case I would definitely move on from this one and look for something more secure."
2,"Liked at first, but it broke","I liked this at first. The cut away corners did make it more vulnerable, but it did seem to protect the phone when I dropped it. But after a little more than a year, the clip lost its leather covering and in a just a couple of months after that, the clip broke entirely. I think something should last more than a year."
1,Poor quality and wrong size.,"I attempted to purchase a holster for my iPhone. It arrived and immediately it appeared to be poor quality and when attempting to put the phone into the holster, it was clearly too small. With a great deal of effort I finally got it into the case but after that it was virtually impossible to get it back out of the case. The cost and effort to returtn it is too great for me to bother with. I have learned a good lesson."
3,Just got it and the case is a r-e-a-l-l-y tight squeeze,"I really have to push to get the iPhone 3g in the case. It's so tight that I'm scared it might damage the case. Also, I'm note sure which way the iPhone is supposed to face. Towards you it rubs against an outside pocket; away from you the glass is partially exposed. I bought it because I wear a suit and tie every day and velcro or plastic wouldn't cut it. I should have checked here first -- especially since I have Amazon Prime. I paid ten bucks more at the AT&T store."
2,Poor Make,"I bought this from the AT&T; store for protecting my iPhone. I would rate it well for access (when you get a call) or routine use (having headphone plugged in while listening to musing).However, it ripped within two weeks, with the leather around the belt clip exposing pretty shoddy leather and cardboard beneath.Stay away unless you are a very delicate user."
4,Marketing feedback,"Great holster, proved to be durable and I like the belt loop option. Only wish there were different color options"
4,Still a Roaring Good Tale,"Thank you, Ms. Norman!Unlike many authors when they have reached their sixth book, Norman can still add innovating ideas, twists, concepts, and turns. As an avid reader, most serial books seem uneventful and formulaic after their fourth or fifth installment. This book was not as predicable as most and contained a complex enough core to keep me reading for more than one day. Normally, books of this size that are this far along in a series are only good for a quick one night's read like Robert Jordan's Path of Daggers or Jean Auel's Plains of Passage."
4,"Good Read, but not the best","As always it was a great read, but the sequence of events was a-bit confusing. If this is your first time reading Ms. Norman, start with another book, because this one assumes you know what is going on in the series.P.S. The next book, ""Between Darkness and Light"", is due out sometime toward the end of this year(01), November or so."
4,Twisty but fun!,"Something of a depature in style from Lisanne Norman's previous works, Stronghold Rising is a worthy continuation of this series. Fans of her previous works will love the twists and turns in the plot, though yet again Ms. Norman leaves us with a cliffhanger ending, which leads to the inevitable question... ""When is the next book due out?"""
3,Too Many Stories,"Each chapter shifts to another of the 7 stories. About 30 pecent of the book is spent on the Leska bonding and having babies. Another 30 percent on Kusac slowly regaining his powers and the nasty personality he develops when in withdrawl. Leaves the Kusac story unfinished at the end so you have to buy the next book to find out what happens. The character development of General Kezule was great. By the end of the story, I liked him better than Kusac."
2,Jump Rope,"I enjoyed all of the other Sholan Alliance books, at least somewhat, but I found it difficult to get past the first quarter of this book, and ended up stopping reading long before the end. I disliked jumping from character to character, there were too many segments that seemed unnecessary and boring. At these points I would just skip ahead until I thought something interesting was happening. I usually go back and re-read books I liked, but because of the layout of most of this series, I only read a couple af chapters worth of story. I don't plan on reading this book again, but if I do I might try to struggle through the entire book, just to find out what happens. I hear the next book is much better than this one, but that Stronghold Rising is critical to further plot development."
1,This series just keeps getting worse and worse,"Alol novels tell a story leading up to a climax that leaves the reader feeling something. Ever since Fire Margins, this author can't seem to leave the reader feeling anything buty depression. Has she forgotten how to end a book on a happy or even a slightly up-lifting tone?Normans first Sholan novel, Turning Point, was masterful and the following 2 were nearly as good, but since then they all seem to have gone downhill. I think she needs to sit back and re-evaluate the series before doing any further books/"
2,"Good Idea, Poor Execution","I'm disappointed with this series. Great idea with plenty of twists and turns in the plot, but Norman's characters lack depth and cohesion. It's very frustrating when characters shoot off in every direction and don't seem to have solid personalities. Norman is definately NOT a Cherryh or even McCaffrey."
4,This was too short!,"I know this book is in all actuallity rather long, but...It felt to short. I am rereading it after reading the previous books in the series and find myself wanting more! This is a good series and the characters are enjoyable. I just want to find out what happens next. Looks like I will have to wait along with everyone else!"
3,OK. This is good for a laugh,"This set is great if you come from a certain part of the world. If you have red hair, you may be able to even speak German after this CD. Buy it if you birthday is after the 15th of the month."
2,8 For 9,"After 8 great albums in a row, I thought Kreator would never put out an album that I was going to dislike. Their 9th studio album, ""Endorama,"" is that one. It's an OK album that lacks in originality (something this band never lacked in before). Paradise Lost is one band that comes to mind many times while listing to this CD. The most obvious example of this is in the song ""Everlasting Flame"". At times I'm even reminded of early 90's Megadeth. And to top it off, The main rhythm part in the first single ""Chosen few"" disturbingly sound's like Motley crue's Dr. Feelgood. On a positive note, the upbeat and heavy ""Shadowland"" is the best song on the album. ""Pandemonium,"" is another good one, but lacks because it sounds too much like ""Phobia,"" the second song on their 1997 album ""Outcast."" I hope their next one is better. Nice album cover though......."
2,Where is my KREATOR?,"Is this a kinder, gentler Kreator? I was all revved up to like this disc but I just can't get past how...well...ordinary it is. Where is the power, blast, speed of yesteryear? What happened to the evil sounding chord progressions and freaked-out time changes that made Kreator unique, nay, the masters of Teutonic speed? I swear I could hear shades of Judas Priest in ""Soul Eraser"". That meandering dual guitar lead smelled of none other than Tipton/Downing. And ""Future King"" and ""Golden Age"" seem to cop generously from Megadeth, of all frikking bands. It's not that the songs are bad, but what the HELL, man...??? Kreator ruled that Ausland where frightening imagery collided gloriously with a stark, brutal musical power that flat out had no peer. But after listening to ""Endorama"" you may be asking yourself just WTF happened to tame the Beast from Essen, and just WTF is Mille going to do about it????"
2,I forgive Kreator for this,"I can respect that Kreator wanted to try some different things after releasing so many thrashterpieces, but they'll have to respect that I'm not digging it. 'Endorama' and 'Outcast' are a period of Kreator that I choose to forget. And since they returned with a vengeance on 'Violent Revolution', I have forgiven them.The songs are mid-paced, boring and some are just bad -- particularly the ones where Mille is trying to sing or whisper or whatever the hell he is doing. Mille needs to be screaming and yelling because that is what they do well.Please buy other releases before wasting your money on this one."
2,Dead On Arrival,"First, I love this band, so it pains me to give this live CD a lukewarm review. Bless James Stevenson who seems to have had a master tape of this gig (plus one song from a separate gig). However, the sound is lackluster, the singing is uninspired, and the overall playing sounds sloppy and weak. The highlights are two cover versions, Vicious and Jet Boy. The Kiss Me Deadly material suffers from NOT having the overdubs from the original album. Oh, one bright spot: Terry Chimes' drumming. Whether it is drumming with the Clash, Cowboys International, or Gen X, he is top notch."
4,Good for the price and plenty of space,I bought this for my wife and it was just what I was looking for and she loves it. There is plenty of space.There was only one con and that was a few things I had to fix taking it out of the box like the mirror fell off.I was able to fix these and nothing to difficult more annoying than anything else but what do you expect these days.I would buy it again just remember your might have to fix a couple of little things on it.
1,Powell Pine Jewelry Armoire,"Poor! Poor! Poor!!! Poor craftsmanship! Poor shipping! Poor customer service from Powell Company! I will never do business with this backwoods outfit. The item came with damaged mirror and the craftsmanship of the whole item was bad. Glue was everywhere, drawers did not align. It was supposed to be a birthday present for my wife and now I have to return the whole item because the Powell Company does not have parts. Amazon NEEDS to DROP this vendor. Amazon customer service was good.... but Powell Company has been... by FAR my worse experience with an associated vendor of Amazon. Amazon, please do not darken your purse strings with these crack heads.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KFSJ26/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleCan I give this item minus 5 stars?"
1,Poor Design,"Arrived with two 1.5 inch separated glued-joints where hinged top attaches. Very poor design. No visible shipping damage to carton. Heavy item from China. Also not all pine. Mostly pine veneer on plywoood and particle board. Not worth the money even without the defect. Amazon was very good about the return, no shipping charge."
4,For the Country and Western Fan,This was well worth it. Great Gift for the Counry and western Karaoke fan.Karaoke Revolution Country
4,Country Karaoke Revolution,"The game is a lot of fun. the whole family has enjoyed it. Only down fall is, I wish it had more songs"
4,Good Game - for a while,"This game is a lot of fun... until you run out of songs. It would be great if you could unlock more than two songs or download additional ones. Heck, it would be awesome if you could create karaoke tracks out of your own country tunes, but it only has what it has and no more which means that the fun of this game has an expiration date unless you're into perfecting matching your singing to the little note bars."
3,It COULD be good...,"But this CD-ROM kept crashing my otherwise-stable machine. Anyone with small children knows that frustration is easily felt by little ones, and I finally had to stop using the game because my 2 year-old was getting too upset when the game crashed. Also, the suggested ages - 1 1/2 to 3 - may be incorrect. Only one game is well suited to little ones (Shapes & Colors) because the child can simply hit any key. The others require more sophisticated motor skills and understanding."
2,Preschool Computer Lab Teacher - OK for 2's,"I have taught preschool computer lab for two years and begun using this software this year as a ""filler"" in my lab for my 2 year old students. I have 10 PC and run Reader Rabbit Toddler on 6 machines; this software is on one PC, and I wouldn't use it on any more. I have tried this software with my 1 year old students, and they find it too complex. On the other hand, my 3 year old students think it is too easy and get bored way too quickly with it.The game simply does not kept my students' interest, and they don't seem to respond to it. If I had something better on hand, I'd use it instead.I also have a major problem exiting this program. The only way that I have found that works is to pull up the task manager and manually end the program.Overall, I wouldn't waste your money or time on this program - buy Reader Rabbit Toddler instead!NOTE: I successfully used this program on a Windows 2000 Professional operating platform."
3,Glad it's not just mine,"I got mind a a thrift store on base so thought someone might have done something to it but I guess it's just the disk itself. It looks fine. Perfect in fact, but mine also keeps crashing. Very sad since my little girl LOVEed the 3 minutes she had to play it (and it crashed 3 times...). I wish they could fix it. It seems like a pretty big glitch to just ignore..."
1,Waste of money,No performance increase whatsoever. Instructions on my vehicle were non existent and the product was not accepted when I lodged a return.
1,Better tutorials can be found for free on the 'net.,"I picked up this book thinking I'd be able to make the simplist of games. I was wrong. This book dumps alot of code at you in big klumps and mainly teaches stuff how to organize the game, instead of game-specific stuff. The BitBlt and MCI stuff is nice, but most of it can be found on the web."
1,"if everyone here likes to waste their time, it's a 10!!!","This book is definitely not for people who want to build a real game--it would take more than seven steps, and they wouldn't be easy. If you want to make some crappy text game then go right ahead and get the book. The stuff here won't pass for anything except freeware. Luckily, that's noted at the beginning of the book, but once you buy it, it's too late."
1,The worst book on game programming,The game developed in these seven steps really s****. The graphics were created using Paintbrush. There's no sound. No animation.
2,Not what you will expect,"If you can see the cover of the book at the top of this page, It includes a picture of a 3-Dimentional castle. Immediately, you'd think you can jump into the fine arts of ""NEXT GEN"" gaming. Not so. With this book, you will jump into the fine arts of ""TEXT ADVENTUREs"", which is mostly the main topic of this book. Although Text Adventures have their element of fun, these days you'd probably want graphics, right? Oh, sure this book gives some info on graphics, you can find the same info on the web. I'd recommend this book for people who are familiar with VB, and want to ""Get Started"" with game programming. Otherwise, keep looking."
3,A good start,"I thought the book was quite a good start on VB games programming. It does suffer from some flaws and there are too many mistakes to make it a professional book, but VB isn't exactly cutting edge stuff. The art is poor, however, and I would rather not have included it. But the code is good, and the chapter on animation is as good as anyone could make it. There's bound, however, to be a better book, but it's a decent start."
5,KEEP THIS PEDAL SECRET!,I'm not going to say anything about this pedal because it's potential is just too crucial to my own personal sound.Go find your own sound with some other pedal.Thanks!
5,Great lamp!!,This lamp is great - very adjustable. We got one and liked it so well that we ordered a second one.
5,Priceless,My father has a very hard time seeing. He used to read more but got to the point he could only read in direct sunlight. This lamp has allowed him to read any time of the day. He said he doesn't make the paper glare. It was worth every penny it cost.
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a useful reading lift. This one lights only a very small area, and not as brightly as I expected."
2,"Ok Clock, Not Worth The Money","I thought this clock was beautiful and thought it would be a great addtion to our room filled with Alaskan items. The moment I opened the box however I noticed that the clock is made of cheap material. It is very light which may be a good thing but can knock off your wall quite easily. The dials for the time are also so poorly made that they can easily be bended. I accidentaly ran into this clock and it fell and ever since then the hands on the clock have never been straighten perfectly and so the time will be several hours off after I go and reset it. I am now wishing that I had gotten another clock. I dont even use it anymore, it is put away in storage and doubt I can sell it for what I bought it at. I would not reccomend this clock unless you plan on hanging it somewhere that is rarely visited."
5,Great Design Book!,I waited an extremely long time for this book to be delivered. I have to say that is was worth the wait. This gives a great look at at great designer from a perspective of someone who probably knew him better than anyone. The photos are great and his designs are still very relevant today (probably more than ever). I recommend this book to any fan of Hicks or a fan of high end 70's modern design.
2,"Celebrity Designer , more renowned for his name than taste","I loved the cover, wish I could of seen inside photos. I am a designer and love to learn from books of all eras. This one however left me with lessons on what not to do, rather than models for success and beauty. So if you hope to see beautiful interior work on grand villas, palaces etc, buy Roomscapes by Renzo Mongiardino instead. The photos are stunners of a full life's in such places, and the text he wrote is so insightful in how to diagnose the problems of a room and how to listen to a room that it is worth the most to me in my design library. I always go back to it for inspiration and guidance. The Hicks book is a celebrity bio that shows how you can get paid a lot of money by installing interiors that shock most and cow nay sayers by their boldness. But that doesn't make it beautiful."
4,Max Lucado's REVELATION,"If u like Max Lucado u'll like this Bible Study .. BUT be aware that it does NOT cover the entire book of Revalation; I purchased it to assist me in preparing my lessons on the middle chapters, specifically 6-9, & 14-15 but this book only covers ch 1-5, 19-23; nothing in between; so it didn't help me at all!"
4,Great Tool for Bible Study,This is a great tool for Bible Study. It is well written and easy to follow. The questions are thought provoking and allow for great discussions.
5,Personal experience,"Bill and I have played golf over the last winter down in the Treasure Coast of Florida. I was one of those people hung up on mechanics - striving to regain my lost distance and capability as a former 9 handicap. After meeting Bill - and having him look at my swing during one practice session, Bill focused not on what I thought was wrong - but on what he saw. He gave me a drill to use to insure that I made a turn but kept balanced - and lo and behold my handicap started dropping - and now is approaching my former levels. ( I am now 65)Bill's book reads like the man I know who so easily helped me. Read it and you may get to be as good as you want to be.Dave Friedman"
4,Not for your weekly foursome game...,"If you play amateur tour events, are competitive and want to improve all aspects of your game, this may help you. Golf is more than having the physical abilities."
1,This is a song & lyrics book - not an autobiography...,Just FYI because it was no where in the description that this is a song & lyric book - great if you have any musical talent. I don't and thought this was an autobiography for some reason.
5,Best Deck,"This structure deck is litteraly the best out there. That comment made that it was easily beaten by a Muka Muka; Noone should play with this deck straight out the box. It is very powerful, but does require some thought. It is an advanced format structure deck in that it follows the Advanced Format rules posted at upperdeck.com. For help on what to include in decks or yugioh talk in general go to http://s14.invisionfree.com/Yugioh_Zone/."
2,Zombie Madness really means...,"... Spending 10 bucks to buy a pack and get wiped out on thefourth turn and going real MAD. I dont have this str-deck but my friend does and Idefeated him with just a MUKA MUKA!!! (I used infinate cards andhad 11 in my hand and demolished his Vampire Genesis flat!) Andthe reason why I gave it education 5/5 because it teaches threethings 1: Stratagy. 2: Math. 3: Realising this deck sucks onice!... ... ... For deck-worth cards I give it -3 out of 1 through 10. For people who are deffensive get Blaze of destr, and offensive get Dragon's Roar."
5,MEMORY,"I was looking for to upgrade my laptop,first I find out which was the model of memory for my laptop, second I choose one of the best (Kingston)and finnaly which have good price."
4,Canadians who went down with Titanic,"Amid the craze about the Titanic that the James Cameron film created, many Titanic books were published. This is a rare account, more a list of biographies, of some of the more interesting Canadians who boarded the great ill-fated ship. Author Alan Hustak did a good job of salvaging these true stories of real Canadians. Many of these accounts are published here for the first time.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
3,Disapointed,"Well maybe I read the description wrong, it sounded to me like the musicians were playing songs together. Don't be misled, Coyote Oldman and Carlos R. Nakai each contribute one of their older, but epic classics. I felt the other tracks were good but not the same caliber of spiritual and acoustic passion with that ancient warrior haunting sound."
1,Maybe the worst movie in history,"This movie has atrociously bad...well...everything. Between the ridiculous scenarios, the third-grade plot, the acting and sound effects that would draw boos at one of those ""make your own music video"" booths in the mall, possibly the most ignorant script ever written, and rapping worse than Vanilla Ice's second album, I was genuinely nauseated by this execrable, banal rubbish. Everyone involved with this project should be black-listed from Hollywood, and forbidden from ever being filmed again (even home movies).If it weren't for the fact that no movie will ever have a funnier ""setting a midget on fire""-scene, this movie would be a complete and unequivocal waste."
1,Who are we kidding?,This is the worst film ever made. Everyone knows it. Even Iced T. Not even Ben Affleck could have saved this. This was the worst Warwick Davis film since Leprechaun 3. Nobpdy should see this. I would watch the pest three times in a row before I sat through this again. It's almost as bad as Pearl Harbor.
5,"LEP IN THE HOOD, DON'T DO NO GOOD","I HAVE BEEN WEENED ON SCARY MOVIES. MY VERY FIRST ONE WAS CUJO(I ROOTED FOR THE DOG) AND I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE LEPRECHAUN MOVIES, CEPT LEP 4. AND BETCHA BY GOLLY WOW, THE 5TH WAS IS MY FAVE.IT WAS JUST FUNNY, AND THE PART WHERE THE LEP SAYS A FRIEND WITH WEED IS A FRIEND INDEED, WE USED TO SAY THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL!ANYWAY I'M 20 NOW, NO LONGER IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I STILL LOVE HORROR FLICKS. AS I ALWAYS WILL, AND I HOPE THEY AT LEAST MAKE 1 MORE LEP FLICK SO I CAN WATCH IT."
2,Leprechaun lost his wit.,"Set in the hood this time, the movie isn't funny neither scary. Starring, Warwick Davis, Ice T & Coolio among others."
4,Demented Pot o' Gold,"I rented this flick not expecting much, really. Man alive, was I surprised! This movie is delightfully goofy and extremely original. It was a real breath of fresh air... which is becoming increasingly hard to find in a business where unwatchable ""teen horror"" movies like ""Jeepers Creepers"" and ""Idle Hands"" run rampant.The movie itself has a storyline that you won't see ANYWHERE else. The special effects were surprisingly well done. The cast was very likable. The ending was satisfying and VERY funny. The extras on this DVD were also nice, especially considering the small budget of the film.If you're a fan of horror, buy this movie. If you're a fan of comedy, buy this movie. It's the best of both worlds. A real hoot that has a few really cool scares! Highly recommended!"
1,The Rapping Leprechaun,"Ok, after seeing this movie, i can honestly say it is the most horrid piece of media that I have ever experienced, even worse than, dare I say it, Battlefield Earth. But then again, I also had an incredibly fun time watching this pot of you know what - I mean, COME ON, it ends with the leprechaun rapping in a club...it was such an awkward scene I could barely contain my joy. Plus, it even has the rhyme master himself, ice-T.This is essentially the plight of the good guy rapper Postmaster P, whose music is truly horrible...that is, until he steals the leprechaun's golden flute from Mack Daddy (Ice-T). But this leprechaun wants his flute back...and he's rapping the whole way (with a little backup vocals by the ""zombie fly girls"").This movie was also obviously made for TV, as the transitions clearly reminisce of commercial breaks.If youre a fan of ice-T AND the leprechaun, this movie was made for you...enjoy!"
3,Leprechaun 5: In the Hood,A great comedy. Probably the funniest of the Leprechaun videos yet. A must see for the adult fan. Lucky Charms is back again.
5,A Pot of Gold!,"This is a movie worth it's wait in gold! There is nothing more fun, scary, hilarious, exciting, thrilling, or adventurous as Leprechaun V. The previous ones were good, but this last makes the series a classic. Thanks Lep!"
1,leprechaun in the hood,well let me start i order this movies got a empty case and im still waiting for my movies its been like over a month now so i pay for sometihng and get a empty cause and i still got screwed over on this one this isnt fair to no customer hmmmmmmmmmmmm getting screwed out of money and the movie makes me think twice bout order again
2,you have to be kidding me!,"After he was in space, i figured the was nowhere left for the leprachaun to go. Then i see he is in the hood. excuse me while i go polish warrick davis's oscar for him!Same old story here. Ice tea ends up with the leprachauns magic flute and the little guy wants it back. Thus ensues a terrifying journey into the sordid alleys of the hood (oh boy!). Its a psychological tour de force as we see the inner turmoil of a leprachaun who badly wants his flute back (""give me me flute!""). Along the way he kills people and flirts with a guy in a pink dress. Yey! you know, in all fairness, i can't diss this film any further. Its almost endearing...in an ed wood kind of way."
2,Lepricaun meets Soul Train,"Lepricaun meets Soul Train would have been a better title for this movie. If you are one that likes rap music and enjoys hearing ""ghetto speak"" then this latest version of the Lepricaun series is for you.It is about the Lepricaun we all know and love trying to retrieve his magic flute from a trio of rappers who took it from a black music agent (Ice-T).Unfortunately it fails in it's delivery of witty lines by the Lepricaun and it's emphasis on rap music makes it quite boring. This is probably the worst of all the Lepricaun movies. I wouldn't waste my money."
4,"Finally, a pleasing sequel...","This has to be the best Leprechaun sequel yet! It's fuuny,entertaining and even scary! It's not chessy, and corny like theprevious ones. It also has a good story line. It's the best one out of the sereis! It is also funny!"
3,Leprachaun in the hood....okay,"I saw the whole Leprechaun series and it was good up to the third one.Leprechaun in the hood wasn't a bad movie,but it wasn't funny like the others(Not counting Leprechaun 4 in space).The best part of this movie was when the leprechuaun rapped to ""Lep in the hood"".I recommend you could see it just if your curious,but see the whole series,even how boring it is to sit through Leprechaun 4,Leprecaun 5 is good.""I didn't come to play with the Fruit,I came for my flute.""-Leprechaun 5"
1,IRISH RAPPER,"Here we go again...not only is this fifth entry in the LEPRECHAUN series unimaginative and repetitive, 95% of the dialogue contains profanity, profanity and more profanity. Shows that writers sometimes can't come up with legitimate dialogue and think that everyone in the world likes to use the F word in every sentence.Aside from that though, the leprechaun franchise is worn out. The little leprechaun is always after his gold and the people who steal it are usually numbnuts or just simply stupid. The rap ""music"" in this film is bland and boring; the effects dimestore quality and hopefully even though there IS still another hood movie out, we won't be subjected to any more. Enough!!!"
3,Remington MS-5500 Shaver,The shaver shaves fine but does not hold the charge more than two shaves. Remington told me that this model has been discontinued - perhaps for this reason.
3,Item works ok but does not seem to hold a charge like it is suppose to!,"I like this item, seems to work ok but does not seem to hold a charge like it is supposed to!"
5,BHG is the Coolest,"Well, since they are Legends in their spare time, of couse this C.D. single is Great!! I can't wait for their next C.D. ( even though Use Your Fingers is going to be hard to beat"
3,The analysis for informediary is not complete.,"Although the explanation for informediary is quite clear, the ground for the deduction has lots holes. The authors like to relate informediary with the other industries but they did not provide clear evidences on why they can use the analogy.However, the three-stage plan for building informediary is comprehensive for ideal candidates. (I wonder who could have such opportunity except Yahoo or Amazon. ) Could it be the plan for new start up? It offers little advices. I guess the book is good for those big Internet powerhouse."
1,For Infomediaries only,"This book is essentially a very well thought out business plan for building an infomediary corporation -- which the authors figure will take $200 million. If you are interested in doing this then up the stars to 4. If you are not, and I'm one of them (the book was a suggested read) then I strongly urge you to skip this book. There are more interesting Internet books out there."
2,They are now selling this box for $1.80 at Big Lots,"They are now selling this box for $1.80 at ""Big Lots"". Unfortunately for me, I do not like the flavor of chamomile so I did not like the flavor of this tea at all (did not realize chamomile was in it). Will drink it for bedtime tea to just use it up."
1,Too expensive to be worthwhile,"I almost bought it, but my wife told me that the local supermarket sells Lipton Herbals (20 count)for about the same price and without paying 1 dollar per box in shipping. So, why should I buy 6 packs and loose $4.95 in the deal?"
5,delicious tea,only kind of tea I drink but cannot find them in stors in my area. The price on Amazon is excellent much lower than other sites
4,Great Beginners guitar,"I purchased my Baby Taylor about 4 years ago, it was a great guitar for one of my kids to learn on. Good sound projection, stayed in tune. She outgrew the size of the guitar, so we sold it earlier this year. It is well worth the investment over your standard beginner guitar."
2,metal scrubbers,They are bigger than I wanted but they work pretty good. They did seem to come apart more easily than the ones I used to get from a Fuller Brush man.
1,Dryer is Heavy and Large,I was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it. It is very heavy and I am not a weakling! It is also very big. With my arm stretched out all the way I can barely get it to my head. Because it is so heavy and big I have 'banged' myself on the head with the 'fingers'. Just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer.
2,African Emigre Finds Much Ado About Nothing,"Despite ten years in the United States, I think all this hype about behavioral guides for ""white liberals"" smacks of reverse racism borne out of a paralyzed Academy. Everyone in a racist society is racist, we hear time and again, but does anyone really listen? As society again turns towards becoming more civil, we see the levels of racism dropping. Hence, as the need for a so-called Antiracism Guide becomes endangered, increasingly fractured, splittist academic groups see trouble where there is none. I have always expected great things of literature and criticism, and my great expectation will be the future dearth of books such as this."
4,It's a great start and review book for the basics.....,"This, along with their EKG book, are my favorites in the ""Incredibly Easy"" series. I've been an ICU nurse for 14 years and found it a fun read for simply reviewing the basics we forget over time. Because it's so easy to read and understand, it makes it easy for the new nurse to grasp the concepts so necessary to be a successful med-surg nurse."
2,Disturbing,"I'd hate to think of medical professionals getting even a review of their specialty from something promising to make it ""Incredibly Easy."" I mean, it beats ""for Dummies."" But not by a lot."
5,Great for Visual Learner's,Fantastic for reviewing systems. I am a visual learner and works great to increase memorization. Good for new nurses/ student nurses helps focus attention on importance of each system.
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible",This book is so poorly-written as to be embarrassing. I wouldn't recommend this occluded text to anyone.
5,"Superb, buy this book just for ADO alone","This is possibly the best technical book I've ever read, and I have a lot of them - buy about 1 a month on average. Before I read this book, I only had a very basic knowledge of ADO. Now, I can do all sorts of funky stuff, much of which I (and probably you!) didn't even realise you could do with ADO. And then add RDS on top of it, a fairly complex subject.... this book is a winner. Readable, understandable, not patronising but not too techie, moves at a good pace."
5,Required Reference,"If you do ADO or RDS and don't have this book, then you must have everything memorized - and more power to you! But for everyone else, this book is a MUST HAVE reference. These guys give the best examples to help you understand everything."
2,Died FAST,I overwatered this thing ONCE and it quickly took off into a downward spiral of death. I've done this occassionally with other plants and just let them dry out a little and they're fine... not this guy. I'm not into sensitive men or sensitive plants - no more money trees for me.
1,NOT LEATHER,This is not genuine leather. Pockets are too tight to fit cards into. Clip was fine but the not ebing genuine leather was diappointing. Had to return.
4,Money Clip,"This hard to find product was exactly as advertised, and arrived when it was supposed to. I should have bought another one for next year!"
3,"wallet, money clip",This was a gift for my husband. He loves this type wallet because it does not bulge out from his pockets as the old fashioned wallet design. I like it because it does not wear the pant pockets as much.
5,Baby's Favorite!,"My 10-month-old son ADORES this book, and I must agree. It's so simple, but one of the best baby books we've bought and that's saying something! You can't tell from the picture, but there's a hole n the center and every page is a great big bagel covered with a different colored topping and the text matches "" red tomato on a bagel, white cream cheese on a bagel"" The colors are so vivid, it's very well done. Highly recommended, we've had it for about 3 weeks and it's totally dog eared already."
5,Great Shocase of Oaks Music,"This album was a transition for the Oaks. It was the first with a new producer (Jimmy Bowen), and the production was totally different compared to previous albums, and it pays off. Featured on here are two number one singles, ""This Crazy Love"" and ""It Takes A Little Rain (To Make Love Grow),"" as well as the bouncy ""Looking For Love"" and the touching ""A Little Love Will Go A Long, Long Way,"" but the showcase on this album must be William Lee Golden's duet with Patti LaBelle on ""Rainbow At Midnight."" DEFINITELY a must-buy for any Oaks fan."
1,This is not a history - it is a cartoon illustration -,Totally disappointing - it is nothing but a cartoon book. Avoid!!!
4,"Not very original, sometimes annoying, yet...","This is a book that truly is more than the sum of its parts.For example, the premise of the book: A 'smart' super-computer takes control of the building that it was designed to maintain and determines that it needs to kill everyone in it. The plot is derivative of '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the original 'Star Trek' series episode entitled 'The Ultimate Computer'.The characters are two dimensional, potential plot twists are aborted before they even get started, the English author's attempts to mimic American speech patterns are sometimes laughable.and yet...the last 150 pages are gold. They work. I was involved. I had to know what happened next. Somehow the copycat plot and hackneyed characters come together and turn the makings of a for sure 2 star rating into 4 stars."
3,"Gripping, yet something is missing....","I have to admit, since I am a fan of technothrillers, I kinda got interested in this book. And yes, it didn't let me put the book down. It has a philosophical flare to it, especially when the computer goes with his monologue. The way the author makes every killing scene gruesome than the former is amazing though, the way he portrays the 18 or so killings. The first thing that surprised me was the autopsy scene, when the doctor realised that the Yojo's brain was shrunk into the size of a golf ball. The depressurised human explosion scene in the restroom is a good one too. The thing that prevents me from giving this book a 5 star is the fact that the characters are too stereotyped. It seems that every character follows a certain mold, a pattern. There's the not-so-good good guy, who has an affair; the cranky boss; the seductive female office mate; etc. Still, if one is looking for a thriller that is sort of unique in perspective, then this might be a candidate."
5,Kerr Out-Crichtons Crichton,"An absorbing and exciting thriller that deals with the terrifying possibility that one day technology will take over. When this high-tech highrise office building goes haywire, all the vital ingredients are there - elaborate action, suspense, dry humour and the essential trying to guess which character will be killed next. Very Crichtonesque, and Kerr gets you turning the pages at the same rate."
2,For diehard Kerr fans only,"This is an airplane book, but if you read it in either of Norman Foster's recently designed airports (London's Stansted or Hong Kong) you'll probably conclude that the thinly disguised swipe at the modernist architect is not just disappointingly shallow but grossly unfair too. There are some great scenes here as the malevolent building devises increasingly ingenious ways to dispatch the hapless humans, but for me the premise was spoilt by the stereotyped characters and the lengthy passages of ""computerspeak"" which do nothing but expose the author's lack of research. I'd try the author's A Philosophical Investigation first for a better taste of his work."
2,Inflated short story,A phone book of forgettable stereotyped characters pad this short story to book length. Hard to believe its author also wrote March Violets.
1,Couldn't stop laughing,"This book was so bad it was funny. Kerr knows nothing about technology and obviously has some sort of axe to grind with architects. I kept cheering for the building. If the makers of the movie Airplane are looking for inspiration, this ones for you"
1,This book stinks.,"I read Kerr's ""A Philosophical Investigation"" last year. Having enjoyed it a lot, and having read several favorable reviews of ""The Grid"", I figured I'd give it a try.Boy, did I get taken.The writing in ""The Grid"" is awful, the characters two-dimensional (cold-hearted architectural genius, overweight programmer, tough cop, etc.), and the plot laughable---a kid's computer games get into the control system of a ""smart"" building, which then proceeds to kill people off one by one. I'd call it a second-rate pastiche of Crichton, except that even when he's writing badly (e.g. ""Rising Sun""), Crichton does better than this. And while it might be a minor point to some people, it really irks me that Kerr keeps getting his technology wrong. If you know anything about computers, science, or architecture, you'll spot howlers on every second page.If you're thinking of buying this book, don't; try Zencey's ""Panama"" instead"
4,I dunno,Not bad but after a while you get tired of it. Very often the novelty of Japanese groups like these disappears for some reason. It is also very expensive.
3,Old Past Master,"This book, written over 80 years ago, may sound quant in its language, but, for Masons, it harbors truths and insights as enduring now as then."
5,Must Have,"We first discovered this book 12 years ago, when we were vacationing with 3 pre teens. We were tired of the Disney World experience and hopped into the car with mountains on our minds. Stopped in the Meadows of Dan, and in a small store found this ""bible"" full of things to do and places to go in Southwest Virginia. We all had a wonderful time exploring. Years later, my husband and I still use it as our map. We use this book as a diary. Everytime we visit a place, we write the date, time and experience in the margin. We have happily traveled all of these by roads thanks to Joe. This book is a perfect gift for people who have just moved here and for those who say that there is nothing to do here. This book is a true gem, just like Southwest Virginia...and this is why we have chosen this beautiful place to be our home."
2,I have no idea what the above people are talking about,"I bought this package for my wife based on the above reviews. Never have I wished more that I had downloaded the free trial first.The user interface isn't intuitive (understatement) and the initial database is extremely lacking in the exercise area. The nutrition database search doesn't offer a smart search like diet power does which makes finding things rough for the first time user and the charting feature was so ill explained that it should have just been left out of the tool altogether.The download didn't include any user manual beyond the help, which lacks a searchable index.Do yourself a favor and check out the free trial on their website first. We opted for Diet Power instead of this tool as a result of their trial software."
5,Good quality stuff; does exactly what it's supposed to do!,"I had been searching for a glass pack to replace the rusty muffler in my 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee and possibly make it a little louder. Obviously you have to know what you are doing if you plan to install it yourself, I had to use a hacksaw to cut both sides of my old muffler off and use clamps & adapters to make it fit. If you don't wan't to do that, take it to a muffler shop and let them weld it all together. After my installation my truck sounded much louder and better, no check engine light, and oddly enough, I get 1-2mpg better on gas mileage! I recommend it."
3,Lego,"The set has a lot of little pieces which at times come unconnected. Overall we like it and my kids play with it quite a bit, also they use the figures with other lego sets."
3,Good storage solution,Easy to install and provides really good storage. Only negative would be that the product is not a nickel finish. It is a plastic painted gray. Overall happy with the purchase and would recommend.
5,space saving shower caddy,"For the price and free shipping, this product exceeded my expectations. Has a handy adjustable bar in case you have high ceilings. The baskets hold more than expected, and it fits perfectly in the corner, taking up very little room in my very little shower. Thank you!"
1,Not worth the hassle,"This product came without any of the small parts in the box. I emailed the company: it took them a week to send me the wrong parts. Not worth the hassle of emails, phone calls and messages. A 10 minute project turned into weeks."
3,"When it fits, it's great","Holds items well but it never fit correctly without cutting it down, and cutting it was definitely not easy. Once we got it cut and up though, smooth sailing."
3,Could have better range of lengths,"Fully assembled, the pole was way too long to fit in my shower (not a tub combo). But when I took one of the poles out it was too short, so I ended up having to saw one of the poles in half. Plus the poles don't fit together as securely as I would like so they kept popping apart as I was loading the spring for installation. Flimsily made, but it is still in my shower holding things, so it gets the job done."
4,it was a gift,"I gave this as a gift (I know; weird), but he said it works great. and five more words now"
3,It's okay,"This was so hard to put together! I had to have my husband push it down to fit but even he had a hard time. Wish the spring was shorter! Other than that, it's holding up pretty well so far."
1,JUNK,"Although I read other reviews, this corner bath caddy was WORSE than expected.Tough to assemble, wobbly, and very cheap looking. Not worth the cost of returning, it has been relegated to the cellar to store miscellaneous junk...."
3,Works but barely,"I got this item for my ADA shower enclosure in my master bath. The item is decent, but I'd have been willling to pay more for a more rugged unit. The finish looks cheap against the existing fixtures and was a bit of a pain to install. (I ended up buying a wall plate reinforcement unit - sold as a wall protector typically mounted where doorknobs hit walls - to protect the ceiling where the unit is braced. ) I feel that I got what I paid for and suspect that this will give me a workable means of keeping my bath products neat and easily accessible. Still, I'd have liked a more luxurious version."
4,Very beautiful but confusing,"The instructions were very confusing. It took a good while to put together. Once it was completely put together though, it really was beautiful.4 nice baskets that will fit right up against wall of bath/shower area. Nice amount of space and holds everything nicely and out of the way.I put some hanging candle holders to help make my bath a little more romantic or relaxing when needed. The baskets hold them very well. I have made some friends a little jealous and envious of my newly remodeled bathroom. Some of them have purchased chrome, nickel and other type of pole caddy items but they all agree, this one adds more class.The next best thing to having a build in shelving unit.The 4 star rating is only because of the difficulty of reading the instructions."
3,Entertaining,"Can you imagine feeling hatred, pain, and descrimination from those who share the same heritage as you? Johnny O'Brien, the main charactor of Trick Baby, feels the pain of having a white face and blue eyes yet being the son of an African American woman. White Folks, as he is affectionateley called, demands pitty as he takes you through his life as a bi-racial man living in a heightened era of racism.Despite its confusing explanation of the con game, Trick Baby is a fairly good book that would have a great appeal to the thousands of by-racial readers in America. Robert Beck has an outstanding ability to paint vivid pictures."
3,VERY SLOW!,"THIS BOOK WAS GOOD ONCE IT FINALLY GOT TO THE POINT! THE BOOK WAS A SLOW DRAG THAT MADE YOU WONDER IF IT WAS EVER GOING TO COME TO AN END. I FELT KIND OF SORRY FOR WHITE FOLKS. HE WENT THROUGH ALOT BUT NEVER GAVE UP. I WILL READ ANOTHER ONE OF THE AUTHOR BOOKS BUT IF THE BOOK IS A SLOW AS THIS ONE WAS, I WILL BE DONE READING BOOKS BY HIM! I WANTED TO LIKE THIS BOOK SINCE HE INSPIRED 1 OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS TO WRITE (DONALD GOINES). WHAT'S FUNNY IS THAT HE INSPIRED DONALD GOINES AND TURNS OUT DONALD GOINES IS BETTER! THIS BOOK WAS JUST TOOOOOOO SLOW!"
3,For a class,I read this and others for a class in college. You'll definately need some coffee for this read and diligence. I was raised republican and it was hard to see all the republican hate mongering. However it eventually showed you the other half of the story. I feel more well rounded socio-politically now.
2,Poor book but still necessary,"The stuff explained in this book are so elemetary that nobody should need to be told about them. And yet, there are plenty of examples of lousy design out there that proves that this sort of book is painfully needed for at least some people. For example, the book tells you, don't use plastic window shutters and don't tack them in place with unsightly studs that dent them. Don't put a pillar in the middle of a window. Don't place bricks above a window in a manner that defies gravity. Is anyone so blind as to actually do the ""don'ts""? Obviously some people are because this book provides photographs to prove that such ugly examples exist.The problem is that although this book will help some people avoid the most hideous and outrageous mistakes, it will not help you build a beautiful house.I might have given this book three stars because it is necessary reading for some people. I give it two because the title is misleading."
5,Traditional Construction Patterns: Design and Detail Rules-of-Thumb,For those who want to put the home back into the house this book explains how traditional detailing works and why it makes us feel so comfortable. It's a technical manual and a spriitual inspiration.
5,Excellent details for classic buildings,The illustrations are plentiful and speciffic. Great book on what to look for and what to build for a classic look in architecture.I have several books on the subject and this is one of the best.
2,NOT for the professional,"I purchased this based on the reviews here at Amazon. I am an architect and I thought it would contain traditional details and construction methods....it does not. What it does have is small black and white pictures of ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" for such building components as arches, dormers, water tables, etc. Very much a primer for those who do not have a working knowledge or understanding of good construction practices or techniques. Great, but needlessly expensive, book for the freshman student of architecture, or layman who scratches their head when looking at a McMansion while trying to figure out just what makes it so darned ugly (proportion, scale, details). There are better choices out there for half the money."
5,Nice guitar,"This is my second Taylor guitar and I could not be more pleased. As a fairly limited guitarist, I didn't want to spend a fortune on an instrument, but did want something that would give me a good sound. The solid wood top is not only visually appealing, but gives the guitar a nice mellow tone that I really like. I have medium-sized hands and the fretboard suits me well for both strumming and fingerpicking. The volume of sound is adequate for playing in a mid-sized room, though certainly wouldn't be adequate for an audience of more than a few people without amplification (the 110e or 110ce would meet that need). All in all, for te price range, this guitar suits me perfectly and others shopping for guitars in the $500-$750 range should definitely give this one a try."
1,This is rock bottom,"Electric Boys were a great band mixing funk and heavy metal in a unique way, but Conny Bloom on his own is not good at all. In fact this is so bad I can't even find a single song that is at least decent.If you buy this one, I'll say the risk of disappointment is very high. Remember that you've been warned!"
3,More color in Schade,"After looking at this book and at Cranach:A Family of Master Painters by Schade, I recommend Schade for the larger selection of color pictures. Not that there is anything wrong with black and white, but you loose the vividness that was Cranach. Plus, I was looking for a reference for re-creating costume from this period, and its hard when everything is in shades of gray."
4,Horse of a Different Color,"Horse of a Different Color is DeVille's 1999 release and is a cover album of traditional black music titles such as Going over the Hill by Fred McDowell and Andre Williams ""Bacon Fat"". The booklet has two interesting photos of the singer, along with the lyrics and with a small poster of him with a horse. 4/5."
3,"Nice for the pictures, but has lots of errors.","""Game Day, Texas Football"" is a nice book if you'd like a brief overview of the highlights of Longhorn football, but the text is sparse and full of errors, especially in the areas of UT history and traditions. While James Street wrote a very nice foreward, no authors are listed for the book itself. It gives the appearance of something rushed together in time for football season to make some quick cash for the publisher."
1,Ethical concern,"I am a long time WordPerfect user, and ordered this product when I recently acquired a (my first) Mac. I found it under an Amazon search: ""WordPerfect for Mac"".It does not work on a Mac and was never designed to. When I tried to return it, the seller refused and said I should have read, and understood the fine print originally posted with the product. Unfortunately, I'm not adequately technologically competent, or aware of this sort of pitfall to have avoided the trap. The seller has told me that 50% of his customers have the same problem I do and that he can't run a profitable business if he has to return half of his sales for refunds.I find it amazing and disappointing that Amazon would have a vendor with (at least) a 50% disapproval rating, and that there is not a level of restocking charge that would make the satisfy the seller and give some relief to the 50% of us who are stuck with $70 worth of software that they can't use."
1,Corel WordPerfect 3.5 for Macintosh,Beware! The software cannot be installed on an IMac OS X. Of course the Mac can be partitioned to accept Microsoft Windows and WordPerfect for Windows but then I would have to eat the cost of this Corel WordPerfect 3.5 for Macintosh and buy the Windows version at an extra cost to me. I am very disapointed in Amazon for allowing the sellers to boondogle its customers.
