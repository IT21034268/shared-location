5,Just Beautiful,"This book of poetry by Ted Kooser was a lovely surprise. I've been a fan of Jim Harrison's poetry and thought I'd give this book a try. It is 100 poetry postcards sent to Jim Harrison from the author during a time of stress in mid-winter. The poems are so beautiful. They make you appreciate the natural world in a whole new way, and life as well."
3,"Dated, tame but not the worst thing out there","OK.. to give credit where credit is due. 80s animation has to be judged as such. Amon Saga is like watching Battle of the Planets (Gatchaman) fun if you were there and remember it. I enjoyed Amon Saga, but wouldn't rank it with even the lowest of my favourite Animes.It is a typical good vs. evil, save the damsel in distress, meet unlikely allies along the way adventure story. The action scenes lack the gore and intensity of more modern anime, the dialogue is simple and the language clean. An updated story and some deeper development would make a decent remake."
4,Nice 80s anime,This is a nice anime of the 80s.The story is nice but remains average.The animation look great for an old anime and theres also a small scene with Vampire Hunter D in it.i can say i like this anime but i cant say i love it or watch it frequently but if you like old 80s anime you might as well see it.
3,King James,"I find this difficult to navigate with no linked table of contents. If you want to go to a specific chapter you literally have to go one page at a time.Also, the page layout makes it difficult to impossible to know which chapter you are in."
2,purpose defeated,I bought this one because the title said kindle audio technology and I want that to listen to at any time but I am unable to access any audio.
1,Way Way Overrated,"I purchased this bible and tried a search. No matter what I tried I was not able to search and locate a specific chapter and verse. I think that is an important feature to have in a Kindle bible.It is also very frustrating to have no idea what book, chapter or verse you are in when you are in the middle of a book. You need to page all the way back to the VERY FIRST chapter to know the book you are in! That is unacceptable.At this point I am skeptical of all the 5 star reviews that are on this book. They don't make sense for a bible that is lacking some very basic features."
1,Not happy.,A certain verse told me I would be happy if I smashed my child's head against a rock. It didn't make me that happy.
2,Navigation troubles,"I had such hopes for this as it touted navigation simplicity. It is not simple. Rather it brings my Kindle to a screeching halt when I try to navigate, usually requiring rebooting. I have over 700 books on my Kindle and this is the only one that does it. Hard on a girl to delete the KJV from her Kindle, but that is what I am going to do."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best and most awesome book I have and will purchase for my Kindle. Easy to read and easy to locate chapter of discussion. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,awesome reading,I love reading this book every day. Now that I am able to read it on my Kindle Fire that's even better. I take it wherever I go.
3,Feature Review,Ok for a free app ... However others are out there that may have better search features and Table of Contents for quick reference.
3,BIBLE,"I like this version as when it reads to you it does not repeat chapter and verse, only verse. It is not totally written in what I would call understandable English, but it's good enough."
2,holy bible review,didn't like that you can not pull up the book you are looking for by name. I like the other book.
3,Not what I wanted,Will try for another Bible. I just don't like the old version. I do like having it on my Kindle I find I read it more
5,Faith is a very powerful word,This book is the most interesting and fasanating books i've ever read!!! Love it. This is my season unmerited favor.
1,A story about a bunch of hippies,I got this book thinking it would be full of god's wrath and the striking down of the innocent out of sheer amusement of our creator and instead found it to be a story about a bunch of hippies wandering around the desert preaching love and respect for mankind and other hippie dribble.I mean it ends with a bunch of right wingers nailing one of the hippies to a cross (that part was pretty cool)...... he didn't even fight back..... what kind of draft dodging flower child sissy garbage is that.
1,The King James Version is probably the worst,"If you were to research anything about the history of Biblical criticism and development, The King James Version of the Bible, ""The authorized version"" is probably the worst translation of all time. The Message paraphrase is even a better translation because at least it admits that it is just paraphrasing. The King James Version was created off of the worst manuscripts that we have and in FACT, the King James Version that we have today is not even the original that was written centuries ago. Rather, it has been re-translated off of itself...making it even less accurate. The only thing holding this translation going is tradition. There is honestly no reason to get this translation when you can get the ESV for FREE, and it is much more accurate."
4,This red letter edition is great for wifi.,"I bought this edition of the KJV Bible when my first purchase was not red letter edition. When I got to my church, which has no wifi, I was disappointed that I could not open the Bible and read, so I had to go to my first version. That is the only thing I don't like. If I could use this at church it would be perfect. I can use this version at home though so I will continue to keep it on my Kindle Fire."
1,Plot was a bit shaky.,"I picked this up for a quick read over the weekend. The stories were nice but it was all over the place the whole time. Plus it was a tad pessimistic and misogynistic. Wouldn't recommend. Oh, and the author is ""God""? I don't even... What?"
5,"Excellent Book, Excellent Price, Excellent Gift","I was getting tired of lugging my 2 pound leatherbound Bible around with me all the time. I love the Word of God ... but I just wished it was easier to carry around! Then my wife gave me a Kindle, and now I am truly blessed. This is the real King James Bible, the real deal, and not a cheap imitation. But the price cannot be beat. That you to Amazon for keeping the prices so low, so everyone can read the Word of God. God bless you all and may peace be on Earth."
1,Cost is excessive.,"Spend your money and ""weight"" on useful items that can extend your life not salve your delusions. The 15 cost is excessive."
1,Too many plotholes,The overall narrative seems to be missing critical information. Whoever edited this book should be fired. There's way too many plotholes in this. It would never be able to be adapted into a movie because it's so disjointed and unbelievable.
5,The Holy Bible,It's the Bible of choice for my wife and I. It's very easy to move around in on the Kindle.
2,holy bible,i did not like it because in couldnt just skip to the chapter or verse that i wanted. i had to go page by page so if u wanted something in the last chapter then u had to go through each page.
5,the bible,"What can I say its the bible, God's word. Very good, it has alittle bit in there for everyone. For the romantic, the scifi, the historian, why its all in there and its all true. Why I dare anyone to prove me wrong."
2,new testament,"I had a hard time navigating this kindle version of the king james bible. I was at a funeral and forgot my bible, but I remembered I had a bible on my kindle. I had a hard time getting to the bible books and when I did, I could not get some of the books in the old test. to open(Eph.). I downloaded another version of the KJ bible, I hope this will help."
2,A few problems,"Came off a little preachy. Shaky character development. That one character just disappears for 18 years and then there he is again, back with no explanation. Plenty of sex and violence, though."
5,I can have my Bible with me anywhere!,"I like the fact that I have this on my laptop so whereever it goes, I always have a copy of the Bible. Very good buy!!!"
2,kjv bible,i downloaded the kjv bible and took my kindle fire to church where there is no wifi connection. i was under the impression that since i had downloaded it that it would open for me to read anywhere. have i done something wrong or could someone tell me what to do to get it to work outside of wifi
1,Doesn't work,"I read it. It's inconsistent. Tried praying, and it didn't work. It was a decent idea though an invisible force that can work magic and vanquish enemies.Turns out the electro-magnetic force is invisible, and so is the strong nuclear force. It also turns out that those invisible forces work. You're better off with math and a physics textbook. Way better."
2,Terrible navigation control,Navigating the table of contents is a nightmare....every book is followed by a list of chapters so picking a book usually involves turning pages and searching through chapter numbers to find book titles...and the first chapter link on every book is broken...selecting chapter one of any book causes my kindle to turn a page...I'm very dissapointed...
2,Barely got thru Genesis,I found it a very difficult read so I then downloaded the english standard version . It's a much more understandable version.
5,Holy bible,I do read my bible a lot i like the ease of access and the fact that i can easily find what i am looking for
4,Holy Bible King James Version,It is a very good vesion of the King James Bible. Most people turn to the King James version for memorizing verses in the Bible. I highly recomend it.
2,Kindle version very hard to use,"I have several in print books by this publisher that are fine, but the Kindle version of their Bible is extremely frustrating to use, especially when trying to access the Bible books and/or their verses. I have deleted it from my Kindle completely..... try another publisher who understands Kindle."
5,great book use it every day.,"I really enjoy the large print as I am 82 years old, I take it every where I go, one of the great books you have, thank you von"
1,No audio despite listing,"This has many features that allow for reading, however, the audio portion does not work. I have a KindleFire and I could not find any audio feature whatsoever. It sounded promising but just didn't meet expectations."
1,Expected much more from this highly rated book,"As an uneducated Bedouin shepherd leading a nomadic lifestyle in a vast desert, who is completely ignorant of anything even remotely approaching modern enlightenment, science, logic, reason, etc., I expected this book to really speak to me. Based on what I'd heard others say about it, it sounded like it would be right up my alley. But I found most of it to be a lot of patently absurd drivel that I simply couldn't swallow no matter how hard I tried. I literally couldn't keep a straight face as I read this tripe. I'm wondering if maybe it was deliberately written from a comedic or farcical angle; if so, it went wooshing right over my head, like one of those great metal birds in the sky.I think I'll stick with my old favorites: 5000 year old clay tablets with cuneiform carvings. Neat little stories about gods such as An, Enlil, Nammu, Utu... y'know, deities that actually made sense."
3,An important element missing.,When you are reading on any give page you have no idea what book of the Bible you are in because it appears no where on the page. So you either have to page back to the beginning of the book to see what it is or return to the index and go to where you want from there.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this version with hopes of being able to get through with little problems, not so. While using it in bible study, verses were missing, yes missing. I turned page and it was a new chapter. Navigating is horrible, you have to go to table of contents and flip through to chapter and verse and when you need it quick this will not work. I do not recommend this verse due to poor navigation."
1,Far too pornographic for a Christian home!,"I simply refuse to poison my Christian children's precious minds with lascivious tales of daughters getting their father drunk and having sex with him (Genesis 19:30-38) - or harlots lusting after penises that are the size of donkeys' (Ezekiel 23:20). It is, however, excellent for cracking nuts and slapping bottoms."
5,I Finally Found The Right Bible,I purchased 2 other KJV Bibles for the Kindle and was diappointed with them. Navigation was difficult. This is the best KJV Bible I have found with easy navigation. I love the Large Print. Not too large--Just right.The price is right also. A great value for $1.99. You can't go wrong.I highly recommend this Bible for the Kindle for ease of use and clarity.
4,Great Product,"This is a neat alternative to bringing a paperback (or hardback) Bible to church. Finding your passage may be a bit slow if you are new to Kindle (my first book), But that was my only trouble. I like that I still get the pictures inside as well!"
1,Table of contents horrible,"The table of contents is horrible. When you select the GOTO option it opens up with Genesis and list each chapter, after scrolling for two minuets to get to Matthew I gave up."
3,The Holy Bible,"I like this okay, but would like it better in the New King James Version. I still read this version."
4,An old favorite,Many Bible readers know the KJV has set the standard for Bibles. This KJV Bible I don't think will disappoint you. A younger generation of Christians is not as traditional when it comes to Bible reading. Smartphones and ereaders are many readers choice. I think you would enjoy the ease of this easy reading Bible.
2,Jesus is my saviour,"The bible is the most amazing thing I got saved when I was six I have loved Jesus all my life and I will always love him no matter the circumstances. He will all ways stay in my life, when I'm with nobody He is with me."
3,Words Of Jesus Christ are not in Red,This is a good Bible on my Kindle for PC. The words of Jesus Christ are not in red though. His words are so important and weigh a bit more than the words of others. The words of Jesus Christ ought to be in Bold or Red. I found another Bible however it is only the New Testament. It is written without the verse numbers so it reads more like a book or novel. It's in Paragraph format of the King James:The New Testament of the Holy Bible King James Version (KJV) Easy Reading Edition in Paragraph Format [Verse Numbers Removed: Verseless Edition Jesus Christ Words in Bold and Red (Red Letter Edition)]. It has the words of Jesus in Bold AND in Red. Hope you like it! Enjoy!!
1,Bible review-Large Print,It takes too long to get to chapters and verses. Getting to books are ok but even that can be confusing. Should be user friendly . I tried to delete it unsuccessfully. I downloaded the Holy Bible ThoughtFul on to my iphone and it is the best. No problem getting to the old or new testament and the chapters and verses are easy to get to.
4,Good on the go,Works well on my smartphone and very handy for bookmarking text.when in service or in a study group. Very easy to operate.
5,Great and easy to use~,So great to have this KJV of the Bible on my Kindle so that I can carry it with me where ever I go!!
4,Just what we were looking for,Just what we were looking for much easier to carry around than our regular large print bible. Only complaint is it is a little dificualt to navigate.
5,King James Version Bible,Very nice easy to read Bible. Would reccomend this to anyone for an e-Bible!! Pages are easy to find and the print is very large.
2,KJV Bible-Kindle Edition,The kindle version is not as user friendly for me. My fingers are too big to select the book and chapter because they are too close together. For that reason I will be looking for a replacement.
3,"Not bad, but could be better","This Bible is not bad, but I am missing a backwards-navigation. If you are in the middle of the Bible you can not easily navigate back to the Index. For me the better Bible is this oneThe HOLY BIBLE [Dedicated eBook-Reader Edition]. Check it out."
4,Amen,"The text is not the latest KJV, but it's no problem to follow this book. The content is what's important."
3,Kindle The Holy Bible: Authorized King James Version KJV Holy Bible,"I really like this bible and the way it integrates with my new Kindle Touch. I was, however surprised to see that Amazon charged me for this bible. When I researched it using my Kindle, it said the price was $0.The Holy Bible: Authorized King James Version KJV Holy Bible (ILLUSTRATED) (Bible for Kindle / Kindle Bible)"
5,God's word,This is also a free download and what can you say about the Bible other than it is God's word and the number one read book.
3,Abbey s bible,This is the best bible ever!!!! :) I love this bible so much!!!!It's the best bible I have ever had!!!
1,Problem searching,Problem searching through the books. It needs a faster method to go from one book verse to another book verse without scanning through the whole bible to get to the next book you need.
2,missing verses,inexpensive doesnt necessarily mean the best quality. missing verses i.e. john 7:37-52. then it jumps right into chap 8. i had to flip back to the amlified (kindle download by zondervan) to read the rest of His word. thank goodness i had the other version.
2,King James Bible,I find it offensive that the publishers take it upon themselves to actually print the author of this book is God.Does God get royalties? Did God sit down and write it? I was under the impression the Bible was a body of books written by men who were inspired by God or writing the words of God which is not God writing it. There is a difference as far as I'm concerned.
1,Completely unbelievable.,A collection of unbelievable mythology. Try Harry Potter if you want something a little more believable and likely to be true.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION !,"I was reading Paul to the Ephesians and shocked when I realized that when referencing Jesus in the letter, all the reference (he)(his)was in small block, no capitalization. Disgraceful, and it is prevalent throughout. The publisher is apparently Christian Miracle Foundation Press."
5,of course its great,Whats there to say its the Bible of course its great everyone should read it. It will give more meanin to your life.
5,excellent,"I received exactly what i wanted and needed, they shipped a perfect Bible and i am able to use right away"
4,Holy Bible,Would appreciate better navigation but serves the purpose for now. I still have to carry the physical book - just in case.
5,The Holy Bible King James Version,The bible is detailed with original translation and I would recommend to other church members and my family as well.
4,It's helping,"I enjoy turning this tape on before I go to bed each night. I feel like it's helping me with my concentration. The voice is pleasant to listen to, and is not too much of a droan. I am not sure that my memory has increased at all; but it does boost your self confidence in your ability to retain new info. B."
3,it is what it is.,"This product delivered exactly what it says it will, but I did expect more. The recording is well put together, but takes a while to get though an introduction on each track. I didn't ""go under"" listening to it, but it is relaxing. Don't expect any crazy changes - it is even recommended on the track to buy some self help books to really improve your memory and concentration."
2,"Tastes ok, some tough bits","I was trying these as a change of pace from the Turkey Jerky I normally eat. They taste ok (nothing special), but several of the medallions (in at least 3 bags so far) had 'crunchy' bits in them. I suspect it was gristle, or possibly small bone fragments. Not pleasant to eat.I may have just gotten a bad batch (other than the crunchy bits, I'd give these a 4 star rating)."
1,Zero Cool gets zero stars,"John Lange aka Michael Crichton...I expected more from Michael Crichton, but what can I say. Zero Cool was loosly written with loosly put together chareacters. The plot went this way and that without making any sense at all.I gave it one star because there is no zero star ratings."
3,Flawed but entertaining fast paced read,"Flawed but entertaining fast paced read from Michael Crichton's early writing career (1969). The Costa Brava and the Alhambra are reasonably well realised, but the pace and convoluted contrived plot don't leave much time for travelogue writing.Pointless add-on bookend `interviews' to bring it up to date.Plenty of one liners and betrayal and double cross. There's a unique method of killing featured, too.The painting by Gregory Manchess is excellent, even to featuring the bikini-clad girl reading another John Lange book, Grave Descend!"
2,Eh...,"This game isn't too great. I only bought it to get the microphone, which costs three times as much on its own."
3,good,"Think of AFO's no frills offline components as more of a practice tutorial for the real battle online,and you may have an easier time justifying your purchase.In eight player deathmatch,the battles can get pretty fierce.It's just too bad the gameplay isn't all that spectacular.With all the revolutionary stuff going on especially the voice chat in AFO,the game still falls short of greatness.Plus,i don't think i'm nitpicking when i say that with the popularity of the DC dropping by the day,the omission of a split screen multiplayer mode is awfully shorsighted.The fortress and CTF modes help its longevity,but there's just not much here to keep me coming back."
1,Not for adults!,"Expect to be killed every 30 seconds because the tanks are very slow. This game is only for the kids. An adult will find it to be very frustrating.There is no real strategy involved. You either blow the enemy up, or get yourself blown up. The cumpter controled characters are pretty good at finding you, so trying to hid is futile!Don't fall in love with the fact that you can fight as an alien. There are only 3 alien vechiles, and their weaponry is basicly the same. The only differenes is how fast the vechicles are able to drive.If you want a sega game that is like a PC shooter, then get Spawn instead."
2,Slim fit...like womens clothing..,"when they say ""slim fit"" they mean that the XL fits like your kids clothes would fit you. I normally wear a large, so I bought an XL... does not fit."
3,It has its ups & downs,"Definately a different tone from the Texas power trio. Not that they haven't shown an affinity (and ability) to play lighter stuff (i.e. Pleiades, Dream in My Life, etc.), but by and large this album doesn't work. There are really solid tracks like ""(Thinking and Wondering) What I'm Gonna Do,"" ""Picture,"" & ""Looking For Love,"" but its also chock full of mediocre ventures like ""Sometime,"" ""Mississippi Moon,"" & ""67.""This album shows the massive uncertainty and tribulation that the band was experiencing at the time (i.e. ""Lies in the Sand."") Much of it sounds rushed to me...like they just wanted to hit a few power chords and get out of the studio as soon as possible.This is one for fans that want every record, *not* the place to start. I might suggest, ""Faith, Hope, Love"" ""King's X"" or ""Gretchen Goes to Nebraska."""
3,"Not One Of The Best, But Still Has Some Moments","I've always had a large amount of respect for King's X. I've been a fan ever since I purchased their second album nine or ten years ago. I've always thought that their first three CDs were amazing--after that, they've always been a little different sounding. Ear Candy isn't their best release, and is a bit on the soft side and also a little bland and odd in places. The songs that shine from the rest are ""The Train,"" and ""Lies in the Sand."" Those are a couple of good songs. ""American Cheese"" starts out real interesting, but loses its impact. Lyrically, there are also some good moments on Ear Candy. There's not a such thing as a bad King's X album, but this album should've been heavier like the preceding album Dogman."
4,Do yourself a favor; give this more than one listen.,"I must admit, I HATED this album my first time through. But, I listened it through again a time or two, and it grew on me. Also, this record is best with headphones. You can hear much more of the subtleties."
4,This is a great album!!,"I am biased in the fact I own all of their previous albums. I really enjoyed this from first to last. American Cheese was indeed, that! The Train rocks, Mississipi Moon has some great melodies, Picture and Fathers are both heart-felt songs that had me getting misty-eyed."
2,Different scent,"I was finding it hard to purchase the Scruples Shampoo I loved. So, I ordered it from this website. The scent has been changed, so it is not as wonderful! I was hoping it was the same, for the bottle looked the same. I am disappointed!"
2,No CD's included,"This book does not have the cd's with it. This is the book I wanted and ordered but I thought it had the cd's with it. (According to the book it will need 12 cd's.) If you want the cd's you have to spend more so, go there first. The version with cd's is currently $50 and change. I just received the book and will keep it. The price is right. I know I will need the cd's to practice correct pronunciation and accents. I am looking at other books with cd's also but am invested in this one already. My wife speaks five languages including Spanish so I will be okay. I did call customer service about it. They were polite and empathetic but you would still have to pay to send the book back under the return policy. Just read carefully! I will be more wary next time."
3,shootin' threes,"I love NBA2K2 but...I love shooting 3's. I let my friends do the dunking and driving. I can decide a game based on 3-pointers, the AI is incredibly dumb, even more dumb than 2K1. They simply don't guard you on the perimeter, and even when they've got a hand in your face, you swish anyways. I can go 14-16 3's almost everytime. Of course the game is fun and a little more challenging in multiplayer but overall it's just way too easy."
5,NBA2k2 Will be The future of BASKETBALL gaming,"This game will be so hype, 2k was addictive, 2k1 was literally impossible to get away from, and it's just a matter of time till we all get to throw down dunks with MJ!!!! This game will be the best to date, 5 stars 4 sure!!!!!!!! ONLINE GAMING RULES!!!!"
5,NBA 2K2 is the best,"Yeah... its true! Nba 2k2 is THE BEST Basketball Simulation ever. It has it all. Perfect responsive game play, no annoying flaws, smart Defensive AI, cool moves, and Explosive DunkS!!!! And yes, a return of street ball with one added court, Mosswood Park in Oakland California. You can play 2 on 2, 3 on 3, 4 on 4, or 5 on 5. This game has franish, season, exhibition, practice, and more. Create a future Allen Iverson or hit the court with your very on Created team. Be smart like me and buy NBA 2K2, you wont regret. Peace Out!"
2,Buy NBA 2K1.. take a marker and make it into 2K2,"I bought this game the first week it was out. i heard it was amazing and realistic.nows its been a while, and after playing it ill say this much.the game is exactly the same as NBA 2K1.. the only upgrades are:-realistic shooting-new types of shots-smoother animation-for the most part up to date rosters-stealing the ball in the passing lanehowever this game is the same as last years in these respects, and some things that didnt help:-same commentary-same glitches and bugs-slow, no fast breaks, no amazing dunks-the games zone defense doesnt let you get to the basket-the all-star level is so easy ( i beat the lakers 125-83, using the grizzlies)if you have NBA 2K1, take a marker put a 2 in for the 1. then mute the game everytime the main menu pops up and play a low-key hip-hop style backround and you got NBA 2K2! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ORIGINAL RECORDINGS OR ALL LIVE TRACKS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD!","Of the 13 songs on this CD, only 2 of them are the original hit recordings and only 2 of them are LIVE performances.The 2 Original Hit Recordings are:Track 05: Chris Isaac - Somebody's CryingTrack 10: Gin Blossoms - Til I Hear It From YouThe 2 LIVE Songs/Performances are:1. Track 02: Melissa Etheridge & Joan Osborne - Bring Me Some Water [LIVE] (This track is taken from Melissa Etheridge's CD Single, ""Nowhere to Go"". The duration of the song is shortened from the CD Single, but I like the version on this CD better because it cuts off the prolonged clapping at the end of the song. The beginning of the song is identical on both versions).2. Track 07: Goo Goo Dolls - Name [LIVE]The balance of the songs are Re-Recordings. In other words, they are NOT the versions of the songs you fell in love with on the radio!!"
3,lost record should make fans glad it re-surfaced,"You know what you're getting here...raw punk n' roll!It's great hearing bassist Corey Parks run through ""Back In Black"" and ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"". ""Molotov Cocktail"" is a great track, worthy of repeat plays. Fronted by Duane Peters of U.S. Bombs fame, I believe Die Hunns offer more versatility. Track down the ""Long Legs"" record from Die Hunns, you won't regret it because it contains more melody, shared vox, and grit than this record."
3,Oops my mistake...,"I had first thought that this CD only gives 11 songs but it is 36, but it's a disappoinment they way that they do it but combining like 3 songs into 5 minutes. My advice: save your money and purchase something that gives you the whole deal!"
1,Total let-down,"The CD claims to give you 36 songs, when in actuality it only gives you 11 and doesn't even play the ones it suppose to! Even the songs that Amazon has for samples aren't the right ones. Maybe the other reviewers got the right CDs and I'm the only one with a defective one, but I'm highly upset!"
3,"Clutch looks good, no bearing, no alignment tool, grease packet was nearly empty","The description was not filled out for this part, so I only had the picture to go off of, but the kit had not alignment tool, no throwout bearing, and the grease was nearly empty. I don't really mind a lot, but if I had known then I would have ordered them too. fwiw, it looks like a really great clutch. I'm replacing mine because one of the anti-shudder springs in my old one cracked, and this new one has way beefier springs."
2,I wish I could give it more....,"Bo was by far my family's favorite the whole season. We were REALLY looking forward to this album, but it's been a big disappointment. It's not because Bo's voice doesn't sound good, because he has an awesome voice. It's just that, for being a rocker, he doesn't rock too much. His songs all sound about the same with very little variation. I only had one that I would actually listen to on purpose, the rest just fade into the background. If you don't believe me, click 'listen to all' above, and just let the songs play for a few seconds before clicking on the next song. They all just sound blah. I am anxiously awaiting his next one in the hopes that he does better."
5,Are you proud?,"Here's Bo fighting for his health and all you Carrie fan jerks can think about is making sure his rating isn't higher than hers. I really hope you guys are proud of your sad little selves. Keep putting out that great karma guys, it WILL come back to bite you and your fave in your butts.Now on to Bo's wonderful cd.I love this cd so much. There are only a couple of songs that i don't just completely love. The rest are phenomenal. There is truly something for everyone on this cd. The variety on this cd really shows just how versatile Bo is. Much love, Bo. Here's to hoping you get better soon and take better care of your sweet self in the new year."
5,Woo hoo! Finally!,"This album is good but ""The Real Thing"" is going to hit #1 guys! You watch and see. Move over Enya (although I love you too)!!!!!!!"
4,Bo was the better writer,I got the dual disc for Christmas and after listening to it a few times now I find that the only songs I really like are the songs he co-wrote on the CD portion and the 3 extras on the DVD.I hope for his next CD he'll insist on just recording his own music. It's head & shoulders better than the forgettable pablum on the rest of the CD.
2,Sanitized for Your Protection,"Ok, Well, Bo's voice is great, as one would expect, but it is not rock n' roll, or even decent pop. It sounds like karaoke, with the singer and the band not even in the same room, and certainly not on the same page.The feel is like Bo put his trust in the wrong people, like the old fogey record producer we saw on Idol. The music has lost its purity and has no edge. It feels mechanized; sanitized for your protection.One can hear Bo's voice, but his touch seems absent from the sound and feel of this album. I only hope that Bo will take more control with his next album, which will probably be his last chance to successfully bring his gift to the masses."
1,"Too overprocessed, vocals take backseat to instruments","I think there's a whole palette of grays between expecting Skynyrd and being happy with that album. I never really thought it would be a Neil Young, even if I was hoping for it, but something less overprocessed and airbrushed in the production itself would have been an improvment for me, even with the same songs.Oh, and the album cover... to me... looks like he's channeling Constantine"
2,"Oh, No, Bo! Disappointing debut CD","Thanks, Amazon, for letting me listen to samples of these tracks before I bought this CD. I was incredibly disappointed. The growly, throaty, low-voiced Bo I saw on American Idol is nowhere to be found. Instead there is a higher voice, multiple tracks that overrun Bo's main melody, and unexpectedly soft, melodic music. Glad no one bought this for me from my Christmas list. Bring back the Bo we thought we knew."
1,change,"Your present work sucks. But you are a great artist. What on earth are you doing? You've got a voice that rivals Jim Morrison, but you don't have a style. Stop letting the producers tell you what the pop culture wants and find your own voice. Who are you? What do you have to say? Let's hear it! Please. Such a waste."
1,see below for,"This reviewer says it better than me and I agree 100% of the time with the words:Not only is that sound nowhere to be heard on The Real Thing, but Bo no longer sounds distinctive. He sounds exactly the same as every other mainstream male rock singer in 2005 - all of his songs have indistinct verses that surge into an anthemic chorus where all the heavy guitars kick in, inching the volume up to a point where it becomes a glossy wall of digital sound that drowns out his vocals. The music is tightly wound and meticulously clean, the antithesis to Bice's loose, earthy appeal"
1,not too good,really thought Bo's first cd was going to be great.I was let down.There is not one song on here that grabs you.Well not me.Hay!I bought it.So can you
1,I am NOT happy!!,"This is very hard to acknowledge but I really think American Idol producers need to hear the truth from Bo fans. I voted and texted voted thousands of times EVERY WEEK for Bo! I had my WHOLE entire street voting for Bo even if they didn't watch Idol, as a favor to me, to support Bo.And this is the result? I bought 10 copies of The Real Thing and I was so excited. I didn't listen to any samples and wanted to be surprised when I first listened to it. Boy, was I surprised!!!Bo's voice is swallowed up by over production and really derivative lyrics and chorus. I can't imagine how awful it must have been for Bo to be forced these songs.Idol producers, what a travesty you have done here! I don't blame Bo, he obviously had NO choice but to sing this mellow, bland, and completely ridiculous lyrics!!I can only hope that Bo will be able to make a 2nd album and show some creativity or at least be able to hear his beautiful voice more! The music is overpowering of his voice! WHY?????"
1,Geared for pre-teen girls and over 40 Bo female fans,"I have listened to the CD several times now and it all mostly sounds like a soundtrack to The O.C.Count me in as one of those disappointed fans who was expecting a lot more of a bluesy, funky sound. I shelled out for the CD, though, and expect to buy anything the man puts out in the future. Can't wait for his tour. Surely, he'll sound like himself again on stage."
1,Disappointed,"I waited with anticipation for this album and was extremely disappointed. Its an album I would have expected had he won American Idol and been forced to sing all about relationships that are meant for Top 40 radio stations. What happened to the rocker? I was expecting similarities to Shinedown (accoustic versions), Nickelback, Staind, etc. I still believe in Bo and await his second album with expectations of his true rock capabilities - songs that will be played on rock stations and not top 40 stations."
1,"GENERIC, BoRING","He needs to get some voice lessons. He's just a fad, his five minutes will be over when the next American Idol starts. This CD stinks, its manufactured, generic music that all sounds the same."
2,Very Disappointing,"I expected a much better CD from this year's AI runner-up. Something that showcased his soulful voice. Instead it's track after track of generic pop songs that has him straining at the upper end of his range. Not a good thing, this real thing."
2,bo the rocker?,Wow. I loved bo's style on idol. Who knew he'd make a borderline cheesy pop album. Lets hope he has more of a voice on the next one. I swore I'd buy this as soon as it came out. Im glad I listened to someone elses first.
5,Brilliant Bo,"Loved it. The songs where Bo sings in a lower note are the best. The Real Thing is a good, pop song, but it's not the best song on the CD. I hope he releases several other songs as singles. This is the best AI debut album to date. Well done, Bo!"
2,Catchy but disappointing,"I was a huge fan of Bo on AI4, and was really looking forward to this CD. I've listened to it a couple times, and I am disappointed. The strength and ability that I saw and heard on stage has not translated at all to this product. Even though the songs are catchy, they all pretty much sound the same. I am hoping that he was tightly controlled by the AI people, and that his best work is ahead of him. This just sounds like 11 Nickelback songs. There is not one song on here that captures his energy or even approaches his southern rock roots. Even though I voted for Bo, and I'm a rock fan from way back, Carrie's album turned out better. Pity."
4,Not bad...,"...for a debut album. I was looking forward to more of a southern rock sound rather than what appears to be mostly pop. However, I really like the ""Valley of Angels"" song and Bo's voice is great as always..."
3,The Real Thing,"The name of the CD is ironic in that it is about as authentic as a three dollar bill. It is a pretty generic pop-rock CD that could have been produced by any of the male contestants (although Bo's amazing voice does serve to lift it slightly above the pack).That said, Bo was under contractual obligations to deliver one CD a la American Idols, and he has fulfilled that. It is hard to see how he could have done anything different, given the ruthlessness of the AI machine. I'm looking forward to his sophomore album where he will have more creative control.Certainly, the bonus CD on the dual disc suggests how amazing Bo left to his own devices is. :)"
2,Its Alright,"This may just be me, but I think this cd sounds more like a glorified Backstreet Boys Album rather than a rock album. This album definitely feels like a debut album. Some of the songs are ok, don't get me wrong, but he could have done better. Hopefully if he gets a second chance, it will prove to be more of a rock album. Personally I feel Carrie's album is much better because it doesn't sound like a debut album. If you havn't checked out her ""Some Hearts"" cd yet, I highly recommend it. She stays true to her country roots through most of the album, where Bo seems to be all over the place."
2,"Great voice, bad songs.","Bo sang Whipping Post and Vehicle on American Idol and blew the house down. Those are the kind of songs he's meant to do. Of course he has the voice to sing anything but that doesn't mean he should. These songs are pop crap and everything that is wrong with radio today. I hope he didn't have much to do with picking these songs. Slick, over produced, unoriginal lyrics, just a really disappointing cd. If you're looking for an excellent cd with Bo Bice, track down a copy of the cd (Recipe for Flavor) he recorded with his band Sugar Money prior to American Idol. ------ After listening to the album several times it's slightly less awful and I do love Bo's song Valley of Angels. However, I still think most of the album is lukewarm."
5,will only get better with time,"This CD is great. Of course, it is still what he was made to sing as runner-up on Idol and not necessarily his real style, but Bo's voice is wonderful no matter what type music he is singing. Just listen more than once before judging. Then sit back and wait for his next CD with more of his own tastes and songs."
2,Bo Bice - neutered,"This album could have been Bo's opportunity to bring southern rock n roll back to the mainstream. Instead, he sings a bunch of mediocre mainstream rock/pop songs that neuter the energy and rawness that made Bo a breath of fresh air on American Idol.A good example of the neutering on the album is U Make Me Better. This is the best song (which is probably not saying much). It starts with a great rock riff, which gets repeated occasionally.I thought this song would really rock!But then the verse slows everything down and it turns into a typical ""heartache"" song that wouldn't be out of place on a Backstreet Boys album. We don't need more songs like this. We need rock n roll, Bo!Clearly this is the work of producers/songwriters telling Bo what to do and not an album of what Bo would do if he was unleashed. Hopefully his second album will exhibit all the roots of his rock n roll experience, none of which is here."
1,Buy for Bo to support next CD and Bo's voice,"I am a Bo fan but here's my problem with the album: The whole thing can get very monotonous, which makes it hard for me to find a ""favorite"" that actually stands out.Despite my disappointment, like many others, I bought the album to support Bo, in hopes that he'll get his chance to ""breakaway"" on the second effort. I still think Bo has an incredible amount of potential, and I'm not going to hold this album as a strike against him"
1,Nobody should have to sing this junk!,"Bo Bice sounds just like all the other good singers out there, but there's just nothing special here that stands out to me. It's as though the music industry has a big cookie cutter that they use to just produce the exact same sound and talent. Geez, can we get something new, nice and different for a change? Bo just does nothing for me - same old thing.Not one song on this cd can ever win an award or make it big for him so I dont' know what will happen. Bo sings Willing to try good but then can't hit the high notes, why bother putting high notes on when he can't sing high? bad decision, poor Bo, no clue what he's doing."
2,Extremely dissapointing...,"Being very excited for this albums release, I was very dissapointed by the result. All of the Southern influence has been taking out him and besides the song written by Chad Kroeger, all generally sound like a continous Bon Jovi song with all the fun taken out."
5,Listen a few times,The first time through the songs may not jump at you. . .listen a few times and you will be hooked. The last three songs are incredible.
3,Not the Real Bo,"I am a great fan of Bo Bice and feel he has a strong and unique voice. That said, I must express my disappointment in this CD. The songs on this CD do not coincide with Bo's southern rock edge. Instead, one is left with a series of ""bubble gum"" type pop love songs. My guess is the songs were selected for him and he was contractually obligated to sing them. Hopefully, his next CD will be more true to the real Bo."
2,Epiphany: My Abundant Idol Knowledge Disturbs Me,"As bland as expected from an American Idol contestant, but not what should have been from one of the more dynamic ones. Generic, marketable country/rock, diet-southern fried chicken, Blues-less; all sung in a pleasant enough voice from a pleasant enough young believer. But from the man who gave us an electrifying a cappella 'Within A Dream' this year, this should have been an explosive debut. His 'Inside Your Heaven' towers above Carrie Underwood's, but analogizing two attempts of the same dreadful dirge isn't really saying anything, is it? Besides, she's the most soporific of all AI winners. In an American Idol realm, not as insulting as Clay Aiken, not as populist as Kelly Clarkson. But not as funky as Fantasia, or as exquisite as LaToya London. Beats Ruben by an Alabama mile, though [on CD, that is]. My grade: B-"
2,Poor Bo,"This is sad. The reason I liked Bo in the first place was because he was a rocker. Now they want to make him a pop star. And some of those notes he pretends to hit are definitely computer generated, because he cannot go that high. Hint to RCA. Leave Bo to the southern Rock, Constantine is the one for vocal gymnastics. His next one needs to be better, or else there is no way he is getting any where with this."
1,"Real nothing on this one, sorry guys, Idol fans only will like this not music fans","The name of the CD is ironic in that it is about as authentic as a three dollar bill. It is a pretty generic pop-rock CD that could have been produced by any of the male contestants Big disapointment. Too bad, hope he can have a career after this."
4,Dual Disc is the Way to Go,"I like most of this CD, (VALLEY OF ANGELS, HOLD ON TO ME, WILLING TO TRY, REMEMBER ME and IT'S MY LIFE are my picks) but, I love the DVD side extras. WHISKEY, WOMEN AND TIME, CINNAMON AND NOVOCAINE AND SINNER IN A SIN are fantastic and the video is a giggle."
5,BO ROCKS HARD!!,THIS ALBUM ROCKS THE WHOLE THING IS FANTASTIC GREAT PRODUCTION GREAT MUSIC INCREDIBLE VOCALS. IT IS THE BEST IDOL CD YET! BASHERS ARE JUST IDIOTS TRYING TO BRING HIS RATING DOWN IT DESERVES 5 STARS BIACH BIACH BIACH 5 STARS!
3,"Not what I waited for, just OK.","At first, I was disappointed in this cd. I expected more of a soulful, ""bluesy"" type of compilation, but the songs have really grown on me. I would change my scale to a 4 if Amazon would let me edit my star rating as well..."
1,Bo's music,Pretty good music Bo made. Not what he did on the tv show though at all. Better to try harder next time and not be fake like this though.
2,The Perfect Name...,"...for the ""Name Game"": ""Bo Bo Bo Bice, Banana Bana Bo Bice...""As for the music, well...let's not even go there...."
1,Sad but have to be honest,"Despite my disappointment, like many others, I bought the album to support Bo, in hopes that he'll get his chance to ""breakaway"" on the second effort. I still think Bo has an incredible amount of potential but I'm very sad that he was forced or chose to sing a bunch of songs that do nothing but blend together in one long wail of nonsensical garbage."
1,I saved up for this and got JUNK!,UGH! I am so mad! everyone song sounds liek the last song!You can't tell the difference and Bo don't sound like Bo on any song!Maybe ONE good or decent song Lie it's alright but the rest are AWFUL!SOUNDS LIKE MUSIC MY BROTHER WOULD MAKE!
1,3way tie for Worst Album Of the Year by Major Media,"If you like Bon Jovi, the newest Bon Jovi Cd, the songs that you won't hear on the radio, then you'll like this CD. Not the rocking Bon Jovi of the 80's or early 90's but the latest AC Bon Jovi, that's what you'll get on Bo's CD.No surprise than that Bo's CD is actually tied for worst album of the year with Bon Jovi, by Rolling Stone. So, again if you like something more pop than Bon Jovi and none of the rock of the old Bon Jovi, you will like Bo's cd.Bon Jovi lost their spark about 8 years ago and have never rebounded. 1 star from me for Bo's Cd. It simply doesn't stand up to even Bon Jovi or other current artists in the genre."
1,No point,"I don't understand Bo's cd at all. There's just no reason to buy it unless you already like him and don't care what he sings. If you are the type that would buy a cd if Bo sang even commercials, then you will probably love this cd. Everyone else, save your money and download the last song, it's not bad. Rest are just nothing special and some are just downright bad.Bo has nothing to say on this album, it's too bad. Maybe they are saving the better songs for his next album."
1,"Bubblegum for the pre-teens, they'll love it","I was semi glad Bo didnt win AI...simply because I knew what chessy popish stuff they'd make him do..So when he didnt win I was thinking..Yes..now he dosent have to fit their mold and he can just make a awsome album...well Clive my friend..WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!!.....This cd is cheesy! Yes they have made him more radio friendly..but to what expense? bO loses his whole identity in this cd.I have bought Kelly,Ruben, clay,Fantasia, and Carrie's cds and even though not all were good..all stayed true to themselves and the music they loved.And sadly Bo was the one I least expected to change for anyone..yet he did exactley that with this cd.I will always be a fan of the ""real"" bo and I guess If I want to hear him I can pop in a AI tape and enjoy and wonder ""what could have been.......""Definitely NOT THE REAL THING,unless you mean real pop bubblegum!"
1,BO BORED,"I don't know where to begin with this mess. Ultimately, ""Inside Your Heaven"" is a mediocre song that neither Bo Bice's rocker growl nor Carrie Underwood's vocal range can rescue. ""Vehicle"" is a great choice giving Bo Bice room to show off his interpretive talent. ."
1,pointless music,"There is nothing on this cd that indicates Bo has any true talent. There is no vision here. It's old, boring rock. I bought Bo's and Carrie's CD, Carrie's is far superior. Carrie is a true star -- a stunningly pretty voice and and even prettier face. Her debut album already selling more than 3 million copies. Bo will never come close to that. Plus, why release and album anyway. There is no market for Bo or his very dated, tired sound. And who called Bo an Alabama babe magnet? I laughed so hard I almost fell outta my chair."
2,It all sounds the same,Is it just me or do all the songs on this CD sound alike? Valley of Angels is the only one that sounds different and fairly good. Bo sounds as if he is struggling here.
4,Good - was hoping for more,"We love Bo! He has an awesome voice and great stage presence. The CD is good, but most of the songs seem to overshadow his voice even if they are good rock tunes. However, the last 3 songs hit the mark (for me). They are exactly what I was hoping for - the ""Valley of Angels"" is inspiring! Yes - buy this CD. (Just a side note - I'm a 42 year old women.)"
2,Rather bland,I am disappointed by this cd. I expected more. It is mainly the songs. They are all bland. The songs by Sambora sound like Bon Jovi rejects. No song really stands out. The CD sounds like generic pop. Hopefully his next CD will be more himself.
3,"Not bad. If I had to do it over, I would still vote for Constatine.","I like it. Not all the songs are great. Some seem to have the same guitar rhythm, but he'll get better. Ignore what some people would say, cause it's not pop music. (I think those people were hoping for another Skynard or something)Bo Bice actually reminds me a little of Tonic and Collective Soul. So if you like those bands then you might enjoy this album. I still think it could of been better however."
4,"Slow start, great end","One of the pro reviewers at the top nailed this one dead on. Bo doesn't belong in today's era of uninspired guitar riffs. If you've been around long enough to hear a guitar talk to you in a song, you know what I mean. The soul is just about gone in music these days, and Bo doesn't belong in it. His voice is too good, much better than the music most of the time. Give this recording room to grow on you though. Valley of Angels is.. well, it's Bo, and it's what you came to buy.By the end of the third song, I was thinking, he needs to lose the grunge sound. By the end of the CD, he'd lost it and gave me what I spent my money to hear. Can't wait for his next one, and hope Bo has a lot more influence on what's on it. He has one thing a lot of southern rockers never had, and that's a voice as good as the guitars that took most of HIS idols to stardom."
3,Bo's song is the best song...,"I couldn't wait until Bo's CD came out but when I heard all the songs, I didn't really hear the Bo that I loved. I only heard the same Bon Jovi song over and over. That is probably because Bon Jovi wrote several of the songs. I am a Bon Jovi fan and Bo's voice is really good on those songs but each song lacks the ""soul"" of Bo.Now with that said, I have to say that the last song, Valley of Angels, has the Bo sound that I was looking for. I could really feel that ""soul"" of Bo that had me hooked on Idol. Bo wrote Valley of Angels and he should have written all the songs on the CD. If he had done his own thing, this would have been a fantastic CD. Valley of Angels hits it right on for me."
3,the real thing....,"I gave this album a few listens through, beginning to end. Not bad. It's a solid album, pop/rock or whatnot. Nothing to spectacular, but it's good. One gripe, though, is that there are too many love songs. And ""You're Everything"" makes me cringe a little bit because of its lyrics. I don't care who's singing this song. The lyrics are just too sappy for me. He sings ""I'd stick my hand in the flame, subject myself to the pain/ I'd even sleep in the rain/God, I'd do anything"". Umm...okay? But it's a nice CD to listen to in your car, especially ""It's My Life"". Very relaxing. And keep in mind that I don't listen to male singers for the most part."
2,Love BO not this 'Bo'.,"I pre-ordered Bo's CD through Amazon. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. The first several songs all sound the same. The lyrics are sometimes sort of bad - ""I'd eat off the floor for you."" - wow, if some guy said that to me to prove how he felt for me, I'm not sure I'd take it as a compliment! Without looking to see what track was playing, I had trouble distinguishing those first few songs - just the same thing, over and over, about how great the girl is, she's the best, she's the whole universe, the other guy treats her like crap, I'll treat you better, please baby please, etc., on and on...boring!! I wish there were other songs that did not have to with begging and pleading for some girl's affections. How about a song that just tells a story (and not a LOVE story!)? Don't get me wrong, I can be a mushy romantic, but sometimes too much of a good thing is...too much"
3,"Good start... but not ""the real thing""...","I am a HUGE Bo fan, and I really like this album... but I don't LOVE it. It's a little bit ""blah"" for me--it sounds like it could be ANY male pop singer. Bo's voice and style are so unique, but this album strips that away. The songs are still good, though, so I do recommend it. But I think the next one will be better! :-)"
2,Love Bo - Dislike this CD,"I loved Bo on the show but I'm very disappointed in this CD. It kinda has a bubble gum poppy sound to it that is so not the Bo on AI. I was expecting that sexy southern Bo that sang the classics and made me love them even more. Clive did Bo no favors with this one. I do hope that Bo puts out a 2nd CD with his own stuff, the stuff I love to hear! I bought this to support Bo though and will continue to do so as I know he couldn't do it ""his way"" this time. BUT HE WILL!"
5,Why a 5 star,"Because I think Bo is so much better than this. I really think that Bo was out of his comfort zone,yet he proved that he could put together a very decent album. I think the next time around that we will get that southern rock we are all waiting for.As soon as he gets the monkey off his back.If I am wrong than I'll give him a negative 5"
5,Bo is my herooo,I loved him on AI and at the AI4 Concert he shocked everyone with his amazing performance. He got more claps than anybody!
2,"will the real bo bice, please sing into the mic","I was anxiously awaiting this album, but have found that only the last 2 songs actually sound like the Bo from Idol. I was expecting more blues, southern rock style. I know that he has to record what sells, but hopefully he got a multiple record deal, so the next one can be the ""real"" Bo Bice."
1,"Big letdown on this CD, hope he lasts to try again","Is it at all original? Nope!Does it take any chances either with music or style? Nope!Does it resonate? NOT AT ALL!This is a middle of the road, bland, pop/rock cd. Bo's debut CD shows Bo is NOT the Real Thing, but a POSER who is trying to be cool and sell records instead of making quality music."
1,mom agrees,My Mom ordered this for me We both liked Bo but we are not happy with his songs. I like song Lie but that's not enough to keep us listening.Mom said Bo had no choice but i dont' understand why it so bad?
3,"Good first album, but nothing special","The American Idol star did fairly well with this effort, especially considering it was a debut album.His sound is reminiscent of a combination of Bon Jovi, Creedthe 1980's monster ballads and Bob Seager.The song breakdown:The real thing-3/5You're everything-3.5/5U make me better-3/5Nothing without you-3.5/5My world-3/5Remember me-4/5Hold on to me-4/5Lie...it's alright-4/5It's my life-4/5Willing to try-3/5Valley of angels-4/5"
1,Stinksss,"Therefore he deserves 1 star! Because the world revolves around me. Plus, the cd isn't good, the only decent song is Remember Me, the rest is like you have one song on repeat. Sorry Bo but you stink"
1,"Not ""The Real Thing""","Bo Bice is a rocker. I liked him on American Idol, but he is a rocker, not a pop singer. This is the ""mandatory"" cd that he had to produce under the american idol contract, which is a shame, because he is quite talented.Anyway, if you are a rock fan of Bo Bice, this is not for you."
1,The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"Not sure who's fault this album is. Clive or Bo Bice's. At any rate, Bo is a great singer and was great on AI. Here he is not worth 2 cents. There is not one good song on this album. It's terrible and if you don't believe me, buy it and hate yourself for being so dumb and gullible that this is any good."
1,La música es horrible,"Este álbum es muy malo. Las canciones horribles, cantar, jugar, todo. Auséntese de esto. Es atroz. No crea la exageración."
1,The Shrill Thing,"Amazon needs to look up the IP addresses of all these 5 star reviews and toss out the ones that are the same because I don't believe for one minute anyone would honestly give this thing a 5 star review except maybe Bo's family.Overproduced generic power guitars, shrill vocals, songs about the level of the Backstreet boys, this is a music meltdown. Go to sites like Jam! and Entertainment Weekly which give this a thumbs down and you will get the truth, this is a missed opportunity all the way around. There are moments that Bo sounds good but horrible lyrics make this so laughable, ""I'm out of gas"" he sings on ""Lie... it's alright"" mimicking a girl who lies, well- he's REALLY out of gas on this one. Then he does all gospel at the end, but why bother? He's given us stale tired cliches and forgettable tunes up until then- maybe it's a prayer for forgiveness for this atrocity. He's got a lot of praying to do because this is AWFUL."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This album was not what I was hoping for at all, after hearing Bo sing the southern rock and upbeat songs from American Idol. Obviously he was doing covers, but I was hoping to hear more like that in his album. This album is trying to be mainstream pop and fails, the lyrics are mundane and 2 of the songs actually sound like the same song rewritten.I can only hope that he can create something better in his second effort, because this fell very short of my expectations for him. His voice was overdubbed or something in alot of the songs, it almost didn't even sound like him.I gave it 2 stars because it's Bo, and I KNOW he can do better. This material was just wrong for him.. It almost sounded like a Bon Jovi album that didn't make it."
2,Bo needs to find his place,"Just watched Blades of Glory and searched for more of Bo online. Listened to a few selections hoping to find his throaty bluesy Skynard voice and found a guy trying to emerge from the guitars screaming. The cut ""Valley of Angels"" is EXACTLY what he needs to concentrate on more. Natural talent in this area. Use it!! I too will wait for the next album where we hear the baritone give us his heart."
3,country rocker,"Where'd the rocker go? All pumped up full of pop that sound's the same. I really expected something a little different from Bo Bice, not this. Perhaps when his contract runs out he can move on like Clarkson and get into his real nitche...Also, loose the puppy dog look and the bring on the attitude. 3 stars becuase he can sing."
1,Real Thing REALLY alienating Fans,"They threw everything that worked for Bo on the show out the window - the Southern rock, the blues, the classicism - and shoehorned him into a bland alt-rock setting somewhere between Nickelback and Bon Jovi. Clearly, the idea behind this is that what appeals to the show's audience won't appeal to the record-buying public, particularly to teens, but instead of building on the audience Bo had on the show, The Real Thing alienates them"
2,Er könnte deshalb viel besser machen,"Ich habe diese CD gehört. Ich denke nicht, ist jene Musik sehr gut. Ich habe einen Felsen erwartet, und es ist sehr sicher und kein Fels im Allgemeinen. Es ertönt ähnlich zu gleiche so viele Lieder gesund ähnlich. Es gibt ein paar gute Lieder, die alle ist. Ich wünsche, dass er ein Album die Lieder von härterem Felsen machen würde. Ich würde das lieben. Ich weiß nicht dass geschehen. Er ist ein guter Sänger, und er verdient die besten Lieder"
1,TOTAL MISFIRE!! Shame on producers!,"Full of formula, copycat, nothing really stands out, it's a total mess. Cliche-ridden, bad writing, most songs sound the same, a total miss. Hopefully,Bo Bice will get it right the next time.(I really don't even think it's worth 2 stars but I felt really bad for him and it's not his fault)."
1,1 star for ONE good song,"This cd is full of filler. Most of the songs sound like throw-away material that Bon Jovi or Nickelback didn't want to bother putting on their own Cd's. The lyrics are written so silly and simplistic and unoriginal, childish and boring. The most original song is ""Lie, It's allright"" and even that song is overdone and out of Bo Bice's vocal abilities to master at all.Over-production and copy cat vocals are rampant on this CD. Apprently Bo Bice hasn't decided if he wants to be Gavin DeGraw, Ryan Cabrera, or the replacement back up singer for Bon Jovi.Generic, boring and absolutely nothing new or original on this Cd. Exactly what American Idols will love. They'll buy whatever is put out there so quality is not important. Therefore one star for the Cd reaching it's goals.Make junk and people will buy."
3,"It is ""Ok""","I give this cd and ""ok"". I honestly expected more, but I am certain it is not Bo's fault, but the fault of the producers of this album. This cd did not broadcast his full talent as was shown on American Idol.Perhaps they are trying to foil his hopeful career by making him such a crappy album. He is much better than this album allows.Someone needs to be fired and it isn't Bo."
2,Dissapointed,"i'm just so dissapointed...i thought it would be a lot better. all the songs are very simmilar, most of the songs are very pop."
3,Not the Bo that I heard,"The CD is okay - it's a little too pop, not enough Bo. Bo has a great voice and an incredible sound - southern rock - and this is definitely not southern rock. This may do it for the kids - but not us 30 something ladies who prefer the way we heard him all season on American Idol."
1,Not a good purchase,"This CD is a big waste of money! On the show, he seemed like he would be a great star, but none of the songs are that great. In fact, most of them are terrible. There are one or two that are good, but the rest are not. I do not think it is worth buying."
5,"One of my favorite CD's, definately not bad!",I love this CD< its one of my favorites out of the idol cds! I would buy it if you like Bo or anybody.
5,AWESOME CD,I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS! BO BICE WILL MAKE IT IN THE SINGING WORLD. BO BICE HAS AN AWESOME VOICE. CARRIE IS SO BORING! BO BICE MAKES YOU WANT MORE. I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS NEXT CD.
2,WTF happened to him???,"Just look at the cover art, that's extremely handsome, cute man is not the one we met in American Idol, but that's not all, the music sounds like anything on the radio. He sounds like a pure copy of groups like Nickelback, Creed or Matchbox 20, which i think is bad because i don't think he listen to those groups nor he wants to sound like them...Bo Bice has talent, right now all we can do is wait for him to take his career in his own way without the ""American Idol"" contract...."
3,Bo's Dual Disc,"I'm a huge Bo Bice fan and have been following him since he started American Idol so I was certain I would purchase his CD when it came out but after hearing the clips on Amazon I wasn't impressed. It didn't even sound like the Bo I know and love. However, I decided to purchase the dual disc anyway to support my favorite musician and found that the dvd side was well worth the money. The 22 minute ""day in the life with Bo"" was awesome and the 3 songs that are on it as extras are the Bo I was expecting in the whole cd. Hopefully, Clive Davis and BMG will read some of these comments and consider letting Bo do what he does best and not dictate his music. I'm hoping to find a way to send them an email and let them know the disappointment in the path they are taking Bo down. So, if you want your money's worth, buy the dual disc."
3,Two songs,"There are two songs on this album - Valley of Angels and the other one. In other words, there are tens songs, all of which sound essentially the same. Granted, these two songs are all good and catchy, but while I won't be greedy and expect 11 songs, couldn't we have gotten maybe 5? Don't believe me - listen to the clips above.And don't get me wrong - I LOVE Bo. He was my favorite right from the start, but that just makes it sadder. I don't have a problem with the Pop-iness of it. Hey, we all have to make a living, and as I said, poppy or not, its still good. But how about a little variety? <sigh>"
4,Bo knows Bo,"Several of the reviews here criticize Bo for not being edgy, southern, distinctive, rock, soul... _________ (fill in the blank). The beauty of Bo Bice is that he can't be boxed into any single category. This album shows he can rock (Lie...It's Alright), sing ballads (Nothing Without You), do the angst thing (The Real Thing), or bring home the gospel (Valley of Angels). It goes to show that far from being a sterotype, Bo is himself and no one knows Bo like Bo."
2,"The ""Unreal"" Thing would be a more fitting title","The ""Real"" thing captured many of us when he got up on the idol stage and made ""Whipping Post"" forever his song. Rocker, edgy, raw and passionate Bo is the man we voted for week after week. This is what many of us were expecting on his CD. This watered down, neutered Bo is nothing like ""The Real Thing"".I love Bo, I think he has incredible talent and all that's needed to be a mega-star but Clive Davis and company have done him and his fans a terrible diservice with this CD. It's generic pop-rock fluff that would sound the same if anyone else recorded it. Cliche after cliche, one standard guitar riff after another and the unemotional choruses sung by a man who's been forced to sing stuff he obviously has absolutely no passion about."
3,I hoped for more...,"I really expected more southern rock sound on this album than pop rock. It is a good album if that is what you like, I had really expected more hard core rock. It is really bland to me, and that is coming from someone that loved Bo when he was on AI."
4,good album,"During American Idol, Bo Bice won over fans with his Southern Charm and his amazing live performances. His debut Album ""The real thing"" doesn't disappoint, with a solid collection of pop/rock songs. The vocals are fantastic, the lyrics are well written and all the songs are great.Standout songs include: ""It's my life"", ""willing to try"", ""the real thing"" and the best song on the album ""Valley of angels"", which is co-written by Bo. Bo's soulful voice really shines on this CD, and combined with good song writing, this is a great Cd to buy for christmas."
1,Is this a joke?,"I thought Bo was making a rock album? This CD sounds like Barry Manilow trying to sing some pop songs with electric guitars all over the place overpowering his voice! Feel bad for the guy, Bo maybe coming in 4th or 5th would have been better for you. What a waste. I don't know if I should laugh or feel bad for you."
5,Great Album !,"Best Debut Idol CD yet. Only Idol CD better is ""Breakaway,"" but Bo has done a great job. Everyone should get this !"
1,Bo let them make him sorry!,"sad day for me cuz this is NOT ROCK! IT's JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE wanna be Bo Bice with some guitars in the back, NOT GOOD!"
1,Don't Buy It,"I just got off Bo's website after listening to the clips. This is a major ""let down"". If the scale above would have gave me an option to rate ""0"", I would have. To start off, other than the tempo of the songs, I could not tell the difference from one to the next. Sorry but none of the songs have any hooks and the lyrics are just plain terrible. When I seen the CD in the store, I could not believe how they packaged this. The CD cover looks homemade. It is kind of sad because first impression means everything. Ok, Bo passed the first, second, third, and all the other impressions on the hit TV show but Bo and his handlers missed the boat on the one that really counts, the debut CD. Better luck next time if there is one. I really wished I could have written a better review."
2,FRANLY SPEAKING... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...,Nothing special..Song Choice Not Good..Voice sounded so not let him..must be 'enhanced' too much..Lyrics Have No Meaning..He Changes His Style And Has Lost Himself..
1,My kid sister likes it,"Never having bought an album from American Idol before, I did not know what to expect. I enjoyed Bo on the show and thought I would take a chance and buy his album without hearing any of the songs. I popped in the CD, listened for a minute, found myself hitting the forward button to get to the next song hoping something would WOW me. Nothing did.The verses on Remember Me started off really great and I thought, this song will be amazing, then came the chorus to ruin all hope. I never heard Bo sound more whiny and terrible than on the chorus of this song. I dont' know if he is singing out of his range or what but it was bad to hear.I gave this CD to my 12 year old sister and she said she liked 2 of the songs so at least the CD is not a total waste for my money."
2,I just read this from somewhere and i think its really true...,If ever Bo's album sell more than Carrie..it's because of the following 3 reasons:***The date of released is very near Christmas(Unlike Carrie's) and parents bought this for them..or give them money to buy..***Bo has more adult fans than Carrie does..and this means they can afford to buy more than one record..(i got one Bo's fan friend who bought 10 identical ones..he was 28 years old)..***Bo's base fans is bigger than Carrie's...coz he came from a bigger place...he got more relatives..and btw..Bo's family is richer! He buy for himself..yeah this is naive but's still kinda true
2,Decent,Got this CD for Christmas. Listened to it 3x and it's hard to tell one song from the next. It's not bad but nothing special. Sounds okay if you like country or pop. Bo Bice sings pretty good on a few tracks.
2,Seulement deux bonnes chansons,Pas cela bon. Je ceci donne deux étoiles à cause de Rien Sans Vous c'est une bonne chanson et pourrait tre un grand succès. Le repos n'est pas bon. Rappeler M'est le pire de tout. Un ou deux bonnes chansons. Je ne téléchargerais rien Sans Vous et Disposé à Essayer et oublier le repos. Trop d'amour chansons.
3,Bo Bice CD,"I was disappointed in Bo Bice's first CD. I expected to hear a lot of the songs that he sang on American Idol or at least the same style, but was disappointed. Thank you for listening, Ginny Murphy from Richmond, VA."
1,What happened?,This isn't the Bo that was on American Idol. This is some sissy singing pop tunes that don't fit his voice at all. I doubt he's very happy with this album. It's not his style at all.
1,Bo got Digarmo'd!!,"Yep, same thing happened to Diana DeGarmo when she was the runner-up, she got stuck singing all the songs that were not good enough for anyone else to have. Bo could sing good if he had good songs.Clive must not like Bo anymore."
1,Manufactured pop cr*p for sheep.,Baaaaaa! Baaaa! I am a sheep. I must buy this because I have no independent thought. I like what they tell me to like. I buy what they tell me to buy. I am a soulless robot sheep. Baaaa! Baaaa!!
2,America Just Doesn't Get It...,"American Idol is usually pretty stupid, but season four was a straight-up joke. Carrie Underwood stole the hearts of millions of Americans. I just wasn't one of them. She rocketed to the top of the charts, but I wasn't buyin'. Now, this hippie trash Bo Bice comes out of nowhere, and becomes an inspiration for rockers worldwide. Yeah, scary thought, I know. Bo Bice is grade-A trash. This isn't rock. This is generic, recycled mainstream America corporate rock. Like so many other Idol contestants, he has no talent. And now he's burning up the charts. Just another sad reminder of how musically retarded America can be."
3,"eh, good vocals but bland","I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I watch American idol faithfully. But, it's the truth and the reason I own this cd.Now, they really marketed Bo as the ""southern rocker"" and the songs he sang on the show were mostly rock and he also has a single with the song vehicle which is pretty good.To get to my point I thought the songs were mostly boring. Bo's voice is nice but ""the real thing"" is repetitive and bland. It isn't rock. I don't know what it is. It was just boring repeated lyrics with guitar once in a while.Some of the songs are good but alot of it was just boring and there are only about 4 songs on the cd that I like listening to.Yeah, I'd hoped for better and I hope he makes something better in the future."
3,"Nice Voice, but not the Bo I know!!","Who is this?? This is not the Bo Bice I watched week after week on American Idol. I believe he sold his soul to a devil disquised as Clive Davis. This mediocre collection of music sounds like anything I can and do hear every day on my favorite top 40 radio station. The unique and special qualities of Bo Bice are not present in the CD at all (except maybe in Valley of Angels). I'm not giving up, though. Bo is a talented performer and I hope his next album will be more of who he is and not who Clive wants him to be."
2,Disappointing !,"After watching Bice on American Idol, I thought finally here is a new young talent that can rock. I was disappointed with the product we were presented with. Not only is ""Vehicle"" not on the disc, but there are no signs of the Skynyrd style southern rock that he sang on the show. It appears that yet another artist has been corporate-ized. All top 40 pop kind of stuff. My wife even noticed that the songs all kind of sound alike. Oh well, I'm sure the teen girls will go for it."
2,Huge Disappointment,"Every song on this album was a huge disappointment. Each track sounded like so many other mediocre songs out there already. I thought Bo prided himself on being a little different during the competition, but this album was anything but. It was watered down even for watered down music."
4,The Real Thing,Good album from the guy who 'should have' won American Idol 2005.. Not as much of a rock album as I was expecting but still a great effort!
1,"""Real Thing"" song same chorus as ""Guitar Man""","I dare anyone to go listen to Bread's ""the Guitar Man"" and not say it's the same chorus as the lead-off single of this album by the same name, ""The Real Thing."" In fact, go right her on this site and look up Bread and Guitar Man and listen to the sample and you will hear it's a copy of that chorus. David Gates who wrote that song should sue, ""the real thing"" is anything BUT.I find myself second-guessing all the songs when one of them is such a rip-off of another. Bice should be embarrassed."
1,Coud not get much worse,"I have tried to like this CD. I have played it many times in a vain hope it will start to grow on me. Except I now know it's not a flower but a fungus. The only different song is the last one, the others sound so much alike, I can't remember them separately. Carrie's album, though, I loved right away. Do they put these albums out so close together to compete with each other? If so, big mistake, they should not do that in the future because her album is so much better than this one, it is embarrassing.Rotten cover photo (They have him looking like a girl), rotten songs, rotten singing, rotten music. Rotten everything."
1,so sad! UGH!!,There is not one truly good song on this cd. I'm really upset because my grandmother decided to get me this because she likes boring sappy music. I thought she would know better. I love rock
2,A sad waste of great talent,"The only interesting song is the title song, ""The Real Thing"". The rest of the CD was full of un-noteworthy, boring songs, not written by him, (he did collaborate on one). The songs were also not the style of songs I had come to expect to hear - as soulful and gritty as the songs he sang on the show, ""American Idol"". I waited excitedly for this CD to come out, but was sadly dissappointed. Maybe he and his producers were too rushed to put out a good product. I hope his next one is better, but I'll borrow and listen to friend's copy, to decide if it's worth buying my own.M. Welch,Lompoc, CA"
1,Makes a great Drink COASTER,"If you are looking for something to put your drinks on so spills won't stain your furniture, look no further than this. It's the only use you will get out of it because I would be surprised if anyone would want to hear the horrid music again after one time. I would like to blame Clive Davis but Bo said ""I had alot of input""- well, that's sad because if he had alot of input, it only goes to show he is much less talented than I thought and I was tricked watching the show thinking this guy had potential. Bad bad songs. He doesn't sing them well. The overdone guitars are like out of some bad 80's album. If this is the real thing, give me the fake thing, it's GOT to be better than this."
1,Bad Santa!!!,"I got this as a Christmas gift but my friend was leaving on vacation so we opened them early. Okay- I never watched that show American Idol but I'm willing to give anything a chance and my friend likes to push the show on people but said this guy was different. I'm sorry, but it's terrible and I'm going to try to exchange it for Green Day's new live one because I did not like ONE song on this whole CD!!I like heavy rock but I don't mind pop/rock but this is just drivel. It's so manufactured but in a bad way, and the lyrics, they are sappy and I'm a lyric kind of girl, I like rap, punk, too but this is just soap opera stuff. If you like mindless pop tunes get it, if you want something with more life, then avoid this like the flu. I've been a bad girl this year, but even I don't deserve this ash and brimstone!!!"
1,The UNreal thing!!!!!!!,"""Be true to yourself"". They said that on the show.Bo said he's not a pop singer.???????????????????? What about this music then?But this CD's songs and style are not true to Bo! Bo, hang in there. I hope you will be able to make the CD you want to make."
2,you had to know this was coming.....,"I can't blame Bo for this CD but it is really boring. It got 2 stars from me only because it is Bo. Very typical AI first release. No soul - all commercial pop & ballads. What I don't understand is if they allowed Carrie to break the mold and put out a decent first country CD, why couldn't they have let Bo do a rocking CD? Oh well, this is not a surprise and it is always nice to hear Bo's voice. I bought it to support him but I can't say that I'll listen to it again.... I'll just wait for him to put out his next (and hopefully REAL) CD."
3,It's BO Jovi. No longer a Southern Rocker???? Why Not?,"Don't get all mad at me people...I like this guy. I was one who totally thought he should have won. However, he said after his loss that he was glad he lost so he could do his own thing. This is not what I thought he was going to do. This is middle of the road Pop Rock.Other than the last track on the cd, this is a pop-rock record through and through. It's essentially Bo channeling Bon Jovi. It's good but it's not great. There are some good tracks and some bad. Is it radio ready...ABSOLUTELY. This will sell. Hopefully Bo will do his thing next time.I was hoping for a new Will Hoge or Black Crowes. Maybe it's my fault but that's what he did on the show. If you are looking for that then wait for the new Will Hoge that is released in January.Bo is a good singer and I like his image. This is just not the cd I was hoping for."
2,Where's the Edge?,"I am a Bo fan and was eager for this CD. I'm disappointed: none of the songs measure up to his Vehicle release or even to the Brown Skinned Girl track on the Santana album. Though he does a passable job with the songs he was given, they are generally smooth, mundane tunes - not one track has an edge. Maybe these tracks are decent fodder for pop radio stations, but this CD won't get much play time in my home. This all said, I am still a fan of Bo's voice & style and hope this release does well so he gets to put together a sophomore CD that is true to his southern rock potential."
2,Funny how things work out,"It's funny and strange, I always voted for Bo in Idol 5 and Diana in Idol 4 yet I liked Fantasia's album better and now I think Carrie did a much better job than Bo in their debuts. I think it is because Carrie remained true to herself.This is the heart of what is wrong with ""The Real Thing."" It comes across very phony and not true to Bo at all. He goes for a very Pop vocal/mechanized sound that is the antithesis of what he was all about. There are a few okay songs, such as ""Remember Me"" and ""Willing to Try,"" but it's certainly nothing like what you hoped Bo would do. It is a huge and utter disappointment. There is an abyss between what we were told we were getting and what ended up in our hands. I suggest Bo do a simple Accoustic or Piano album next time where he can shine instead of trying too hard to please the pop crowd. That's not where I thought his heart was, and I'm surprised he gave in so easily. 2 out of 5 stars. Better luck next time."
1,not too good,"I really think the song writers have come up with some really good lyrics, and the tunes are good,but I truly hear them being song by other artists. I know to some Bo is the best thing on earth. To me I get Nothing! Sorry!"
5,GREAT,"It's not easy to find an artist that can make an album that good, not only the vocals are great but in fact I have come to like every song on this album, this came to me as a surprise because we all knew this guy can sing ( duh! ) but that's a whole different thing when you make a solo album.Bo Bice stook to the music that made him an Idol finalist.I strongly recomend this album and in fact I will be expecting the release of it's follow up Cd"
2,"Let him sing his own songs, record company!","After listening to what Bo could do on ""American Idol,"" especially the song he sung a capella, I decided to snatch up this album as soon as it hit the market. Egad! Where's the Bo I know?! I was certainly disappointed. After getting the album, I happened to watch an interview story where cameras followed Bo in the making of this thing. It was a terrible choice on the part of the studio/producer/record company/whoever's ultimate decision this was to not let Bo sing his own songs on this album. He's a great song-writer and can put his fantastic voice into his own songs with so much more heart than this album delivered. If you want just another album with so-so songs on it, go for it. If you want the real Bo, hope and pray that the undoubtedly stagnant sales from this album don't stop him from making a second album that demonstrates his true ability. I am not impressed with the square hole he got crammed into on this one."
5,5 Star Debut!,"I don't get why everyone's bashing Bo for his music, IMO he's really good. The songs are catchy, he sings in tune, it's a refreshing style, not your generic radio trash. His music will do good, and is already doing good. A huge eyeroll to the idiots who are rating him low. You are only making yourself look stupid. Great CD."
2,"""So what?"" songs","I thought Bo Bice was going to awe us all with his debut album. Instead, I was left wondering why he bothered to record this CD. The only song worth listening to is ""Valley of Angels,"" as it reflects the true style of the real Bo; the rest of the songs are very forgettable. We know Bo Bice can do better, so I am already looking forward to his next CD."
2,Where is Bo??,I really wanted to like this cd. The Bo Bice from American Idol is a great singer. I had the privilege of seeing him on the tour and he is an outstanding musician with commanding stage presence. The only hint of that Bo Bice on this album is the last track. I am sure the producers were trying to make this cd more marketable and radio friendly. Maybe it will be...time will tell. But I hope he gets a shot to record his own music in his own style in the future.
1,AWLFUL !!!,THE CD SUCKS...NOT ROCK...NOT BO...TERRIBLE SOUND...TERRIBLE LYRICS...TERRIBLE SONGS...TERRIBLE CD COVER...WHAT SHOULD I SAY EXCEPT...IT SUCKS!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! IDOL ROCK NEEDS TO BE LEFT IN CONSTANTINES HANDS !!!
2,Buy the Dual Disc,"Don't waste your money on the CD but buy the Dual Disc version. The songs (Not Bo's singing) are terrible. Almost every song is you did me wrong or I did you wrong or why don't we love each other. The only good song is Valley of Angels which was written by him. However if you get the Dual Disc, you can play the dvd side which he sings songs he wrote. If you are a Bo Bice fan you are going to be disappointed in the CD songs but happy with the dvd songs that show what he is really about."
2,Confused Identity clear from this album,"I would characterize The Real Thing as a sort of catch-all commercial rock album (recognizing that ""commercial"" and ""rock"" seem kind of antithetical to each other). It's catch-all in that the album offers a taste of pop metal, alt rock, emo, pop rock and country/Southern rock. The catch-all nature is a bit of a problem for me, because it deprives a guy who established a clear and coherent identity while on AI of what really distinguished him on the show. It turns Bo into an imitator (of the likes of Bon Jovi, Nickelback, Switchfoot, etc.)"
3,One Star For Each Bonus Track,"What they couldn't do on stage, they've done on CD. They sucked the life out of Bo. The tracks selected for the CD are overpolished, quickly forgotten, and devoid of any risk-taking or soul.The three bonus tracks on the DVD side save this disk from being a total failure. If you've enjoyed the Sugarmoney CD, they're a welcome addition from a talented songwriter.RCA should have just signed his band and let them rip. Instead we get . . . well, this."
2,"3rd Rate, 2nd Place","I'm giving this 2 stars because of the beautiful ""Valley of Angels."" The rest of it is just ghastly!! ONE LONG MONOTONE SONG THAT NEVER ENDS- (That's what it is because they ALL but the LAst one SOUND THE SAME!!) and then he gives us one song, JUST ONE SONE, that is worth listening to, but it is NOT worth buying a CD for!!Bo said he was HAPPY to be in 2nd place because he would be able to do the music he wanted to do- THIS IS IT?!?!?? THIS IS DREADFUL!!!! This is NOT the TYPE OF MUSIC HE SANG ON THE SHOW NOR THE TYPE OF MUSIC HE SAID HE LIKED!!This album is a TRAIN WRECK!! But- it does have that one nice song on it- I wish it could have been a single I saved some money on the rest of these carbon-copy songs. What in the world was he thinking?!?!"
1,Save Your Money,If you were a Bo fan before this you will not be much of a fan after you hear the songs on this CD. I thought Bo did not want to win so he can make the kind of Album he wanted to make. After listening to this CD I hate to admit but he is a poser. The lyrics are awful the music is just painful to your ears. If I wanted to hear this kind of music I would have bought a Justin Timberlake CD. Don't spend the money on this.This CD gets two thumbs down.
2,"A guy needs to make a buck, dig?","This music is homoginized. It's slick and it's cute and it has hooks and it's all played flawlwssly by session men. There is nthing wrong with music played by producers and session men. And do i blame Bo for saying to Clive Davis...""yes...I would like you to produce a record for me with smooth session men and catchy top 40 songs and get a good solid start on a career in music...""Of course not. i expected no better than this anyway. I like the guy and I like his voice and i hope after he get sick of this dribble in a few years he puts out a record with soul and guitars cracking and balls.I have not quit on you Bo..but I cannot keep this baby food down."
1,NOT rock just typical pop fluff filler,"That album is just another pop-product. It's ubersafe. Does he even have guitar solos in his songs? Man, a rock song without solos, outside of punk... man, I miss these. Even BonJovi has a solo in ""Have a nice day""."
1,Can have it both ways,"I hear both sides from the Bo sites. Some people say they just want Bo to outsell Carrie and dont' care how or what kind of music he makes as long as he does. Others are wanting him to make more bluesy, creative, rock and dont' care about sales.What do I think?: I certainly don't think a desire to see Bo succeed is in tension with an opinion that his album blows bigtime!I bought it but argh, it just drives me up the wall."
3,A bit sad,"Being an Idol Addict and one who really pulled for Bo to win, I really wanted an album of his. Making a choice based on the bits of tracks, I picked this one. It isn't bad, but a bit dull. I expected more based on his Idol showings."
2,"The ""Unreal"" Thing would be a more fitting title for this","The ""Real"" thing captured many of us when he got up on the idol stage and made ""Whipping Post"" forever his song. Rocker, edgy, raw and passionate Bo is the man we voted for week after week. This is what many of us were expecting on his CD. This watered down, neutered Bo is nothing like ""The Real Thing"".I love Bo, I think he has incredible talent and all that's needed to be a mega-star but Clive Davis and company have done him and his fans a terrible diservice with this CD. It's generic pop-rock fluff that would sound the same if anyone else recorded it. Cliche after cliche, one standard guitar riff after another and the unemotional choruses sung by a man who's been forced to sing stuff he obviously has absolutely no passion about."
5,Bo is awesome,"Wow, I am so amazed at how good this really is. Wow! Keep the work up Bo! You rockkk. My favorite is The Real Thing but some other good ones are on here too."
5,5 stars amazing work,"I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT WAS PUT TOGETHER My favorite song is The Real Thing but I also really like Remember Me, you'll like it not only if you're a fan of idol, but if you're a fan of any music. It didn't sell 230k for no reason, Bo Rocks. Carrie fans - wait a few years and see whos winning then ;)"
5,Bo Bice is the Real Thing,"This DVD/CD is mesmerizing. Each time I listen I enjoy it more. Valley of Angels, It's My Life, You're Everything - and the rest of the songs on the CD side are terrific; then listen to the bonus tracks on the DVD and try to decide which are the best - I can't decide - I love them all. This is a listening experience you'll enjoy every time you are lucky enough to hear it."
5,Bo Bice Does It Again!!!,"The first time I saw Bo Bice on American Idol was when he belted out the powerful ""Spinning Wheel."" I was immediately taken back by the power and strength of his voice and his incredible stage presence. I didn't think they could find another great runner-up like Clay Aiken. But to my surprise, they had indeed found another great voice.Following Bo each week on the show was thrilling. Even though I'm still disappointed that he lost, I am completely surprised and overwhelmed by his new album. Again, Mr. Bice leaves me speechless. After hearing Kelly Clarkson's ""Breakaway,"" I didn't think anything could come close or touch that album. But ""The Real Thing"" is at least a valid attempt at capturing some of that greatness that Miss Clarkson's album found.I don't know if this album will end up selling like ""Breakaway,"" but it's equally as fulfilling. I just wish Bo the best of luck with all of his future projects and musical endeavors."
3,Could have been SO much better...,"I'm a Bo fan right from his first performance on American Idol, so I was very much looking forward to this CD. When the vocals kicked in on the title track, I had to pop the CD out to make sure it was the right CD...it didn't sound like Bo at all. The CD got better, but it never quite pulled me all the way in. It's good, radio-friendly pop rock, but it doesn't even come close to the great classic rock/southern rock style he showcased so well during the show. Bo has co-writing credits on two tracks (It's My Life and Valley of Angels), and he gets some big-name help too, with songs written by Nickelback's Chad Kroeger (You're Everything) and Jon Bon Jovi & Richie Sambora (Nothing Without You and Willing To Try). Some of the songs are quickly growing on me, but overall I'm not impressed."
4,Next CD lets make it The Real Thing,"I love Bo's strong rock voice and so this CD was somewhat of a disappointment over all. I know when you are just starting out in the big time you have to make a CD that you think will appeal to the masses, but this CD didn't do Bo's amazing talent justice. Even with my disappointment I must admit that it is still a joy to listen to Bo's voice and so in the end I'm not sorry I bought it. I just hope next time RCA will allow Bo to be the performer we know he is and a lot less pop/bubble gum sound on the CD. In the end I'm still a very big fan and eagerly await the next CD"
1,WTF is this Bo?,"Remember the audition when you were asked why you wanted to be the American Idol? Do you? You said because American Idol could use some rock, some blues!! WTF did you forget what you said and what you kept saying about just wanting to make your music and that you didn't care if anybody bought it as long as you liked it??????? GUESS WHAT? Your taste stinks and you sold-out!!"
2,Very GOOD!,I think it's great to find a pop album in today's music scene that kids can listen to as well as the older folks. There are no bad lyrics or imagery on any of the songs and the lyrics are simple enough for anyone to relate to and remember quite easily. The music is catchy and Bo sounds great!! WTG Bo!! (fingers crossed that next album is even better!!)
2,not a bad album..not a good one too..,i see no reason buying this album..because there's nothing in him tt makes me admire or like him..he's just a man who decided to make a rock album for his family to listen to...
1,HUGE FLOP!!!!!,"Rolling Stone just declared this one of the stalest rock albums of the year and it's easy to see why. I can't believe I bought this thing! And worse, I can't think of anyone I hate enough to give it to.Just a big flop all the way around. I have to admit, though, ""Lie... it's alright"" is so terrible, it is almost fun to hear. If you like bland Bon Jovi tunes that even they would not record, this is for you. Overdone vocals fed like spaguetti through a process machine, stupid words, BAD BAD tunes. The worst songs are the title one, that sounds like some old 70's tune, ""Willing to Try,"" and I don't even like the last one, ""Valley of Angels."" This whole album is a valley, DEATH VALLEY."
2,Quite dissapointed..i'll nv support Bo again..,"i just realise tt he do not know who he really is..people with noi personality cant last for long..good luck Bo! Learn from Carrie, knwing who she really is and make the KIND of music she should make.."
1,BlUnder,"Bo Bice not only seemed like the show's first rocker on the verge of stardom, but one of the most promising singers and runnerups they ever had, this qualifies as the biggest blunder in American Idol's history, That is the Real Thing."
1,go away!,"Sto pretending and lying and acting like this is a good album! He'll never be as good as Kelly Clarkson. When I went to the store, there were his CD's piled up in stacks because nobody was buying them, expect a huge drop in sales next week. He won't last, because theres nothing special about him,. can you say.. one hit wonder?"
1,Nothing's special...,she sounds ordinary..nothing speacial tt will surprise you..he a rocker..an just a rocker..nth more..just there's no 'it' factor...
3,Nothing special...,"I was a little dissapointed with this album. The lyrics seemed pretty plain, and lacked soul on Bo's part. I only found two tracks worth listening to, and those were, ""The real thing,"" and ""Lie...it's alright"". As with Carrie Underwoods debut, i was really dissapointed with this cd."
2,Not what i thought it would be,"Im been getting into airsoft lately and this was my first buy for a rifle. The motor is too storng for the plastic gears and stripped them all turning the gearbox to crap. And another thing, you think Hi-cap mags from a G36 might work (cause it fits fine), no it doesent the hole from the mag is a lil off, so finding hi cap mags is pretty much not going to happen. the only good thing about this is that its an XM8. dont really see those at all. So im going to make this my lil project and upgrade it to a deathmachine with G36 parts so my mags will work. Other than that fork out another $50 for a way better gun, talk to people who know airsoft if your new to, thats what i should of done..."
1,Watch Band will break,"I'm so disappointed with Nike. I got this beautiful watch for my birthday and can't wear it anymore. The plastic band tore with only 9 months of normal wear. Nike doesn't sell replacements bands and there are no aftermarket bands that will fit. Searching about today, and I'm reading nike reviews commenting on the plastic bands tearing. This is terrible and Nike should step up and fix this."
3,Not what I expected,The plastic on the band is a bit harder than I expected. I thought it would be a softer feel... Instead the watch feels sweaty and sticks to my skin a bit. It is an easy watch to figure out all of the gadget parts to. I do like the simplicity of it.
1,I did not like it. Uninformative.,"I do not feel like your book covered very much area about the study, care of, and treatments of aphasia. I suggest doing more research, and checking your sources of information."
1,beware noting to do with Jet li or once upon a time in China,Cant even belive it's not good. Amator night at the movies.
4,H1N1 No Competition for the Spanish Flu,"Thanks to 24 hour news on television, radio and the internet whipped the general public into a frenzy ""the H1N1 coming pandemic will be MUCH worse than the 1918 Spanish Influenza"". Thank God for the H1N1 vaccine because the doomday sayers were absolutely wrong! I reread this book during all the H1N1 scare and I have to say as a healthcare professional it was a great book documenting accounts of a TRUE pandemic. Neither dry or overly professional, (but at the same time scarily factual) it would easily keep anyone's interest. I had family members lose their lives during the 1918 Influenza and considering the facts I am surprised I did not lose more.Highly recommend!"
3,The author states too many statistics,"The book was very informative but I felt like I was being quoted statistics more than the authors interpretive research. I felt the author related the scope of the pandemic but not the implications, short term or long term."
2,Not sure what to think,"Although this book did get me farther along than I was without it, I don't like the fact that the author keeps pushing the use of other 3rd party equipment / purchased items instead of just the plain simple PC... standard mouse, keyboard, cpu, monitor. Makes you wonder if he owns stock in the products that he's ""pitching"" or if he is trying to get some money from the companies as sponsorship."
4,Excellent Overview,"This book is a great overview of the Bible, full of information and humour in equal portions. The best starting out guide to the reader who wants to figure out how the various parts of the Bible fit together and fit within history."
4,Fun with Kids,"I bought this book for my 5 year old as she loves arts and crafts. Some of the more three dimensional projects in the book were difficult to do, however. For a child, I would recommend the more basic design books by the same author."
2,Did any of you actually read the first book?,"It amazes me to see so many highly rated reviews on here. I read this book and the world on blood and found many editorial mistakes. It was like reading a book that wasn't related at all to the first. There were flashbacks that mentioned things that never occured in the first book as well as mentioning that Selene didn't know Whistler's wife. I was really dissapointed in this book. An I also agree with the previous posting about his use of the Dianic name in his Witchcraft. As a practicing witch, I was rather offended by Nasaw's lack of research into the religion and the way he portrayed the rituals. I had high hopes after the world on blood but this book was just a let down."
4,Fantastic!!..a must for all who love vampires story.,"I enjoy the story so much which is a rarity for me because i could never find a good, enjoyable story about VAMPIRES.This story is particularly interesting for me because of the way the author potray the logic behind the myths of vampires legend per se which i could accept. I love the relationships of the characters and their never ending love for each other although they had led different lives from one another.The book is simply sexy, funny and chilling at times, romantic, wonderful and sad. Simply the best!"
3,Striga and Strigoa,"An interesting novel that held my interest until the very end. As someone relatively new to the Wiccan witch culture, and Drinkers vampire empire, I relished the information and knowledge gained in this pleasure-reading novel."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this game as I love Bass Fishing 1. However, dispite the reviews I read, and the listing that stated 1 or 2 players could play the game, only 1 player is available. Also, I have Bass Fishing and Deep Sea Fishing and really enjoy them both, but they worked to make this one more difficult, and were successful. However, if you just want to have fun for ten minutes and catch a few fish, they have made it too hard. Yes, serious fisherman might enjoy this aspect, but one of the reasons I don't enjoy real fishing is that I don't like to spend hours just waiting for a bite. They could have had easy, medium and hard settings for the different desires of people. My advise is save the $ and just buy the original version."
2,don't be mislead......,"I love Mega Man... but fail to see how this relates to Mega Man...there is no MM related music... just a bunch of VA songs....nice packaging, though...."
1,Ouch! Thats gotta sting!,"Personally , I think agreeing to this was one of Capcom's biggest blunders. The video games soundtracks sound a million times better than anything on this sorry CD."
2,Not too hot.,"I got this CD expecting the music to be from the series. It's not. It's simply a collection of songs that Capcom obviusly believes fit in with Mega Man. The only song related to the show is the last one, and it just has a voice saying ""Mega Man"" over and over. Not a good buy in my opinion."
5,Funk is Back!,"This music reminds you of how music had feeling and musicians actually made music to make you groove without the frequent statement of, '... That song is remade from ...' I appreciate the compilation 2 disk CD set. I didn't realize how much this generation samples older music until I heard these CD's. I highly recommend anyone who can appreciate funk music to get it and play it as loud as the music of today."
3,OK But Too Far Fetched,It's an ok movie with a bit of a tired story. Though it is moderately entertaining if you can look past haw rediciously far-fetched it is.
2,"Explosive, Noisy mess","I know quite a few people that like this movie, and I have to respect their opinions even if I don't agree with them. Like ""Quantum of Solace"" this movie was simply an explosive, noisy mess. Hollywood thinks that the more explosions they have in an action film the better the film will be. But too much of it turns boring if there isn't some intelligent writing and dialog to support the action - and here there isn't. Just more explosions...more chase scenes...more explosions...more chase scenes...more mindless drivel."
2,Be warned...,This movie was good and entertaining and I really enjoyed watching it... until the end. The ending of this movie is terrible! Quite possibly the worst ending to a movie I have ever seen and as a movie freak I have seen alot of movies and alot of terrible endings. I think Shia Labeouf is becoming a great actor and Spielberg is a genius but this was just ridiculous. The ending turned a good entertaining movie into complete garbage. I give this movie 2 stars because I'd say if you really want to see it it might be worth watching once but just be ready to leave disappointed at the end.
2,You knew liberal hollywood would make this movie eventually...,"Whoever mentioned liberal paranoia in their review about this flick was dead on....Gov't control over our electronics is probably high on every liberals 'scare list'. The other absolutely striking thing about it, is it could probably win an award for THE most stupidly outlandish plot ever conceived, and that is saying something. Even I can overlook blatant absurdity in a movie, if there is still something redeeming in it, like cool action scenes or fx, etc...This movie changed that. It's that absurd, and no amount of action comes close to saving it. From the very first minute, THE most implausible things start happening and it just gets worse and worse until you find yourself just waiting for some cool action scenes or something to forget the 100% improbable and flat out laughable story."
5,It just keeps coming at you ... very intense,A very strong action/adventure movie with a huge suspense element. This movie starts fast and keeps going. Its a movie where you have no real idea of whats going on until the end. It just keeps building and building. And why the heck are these two key characters forced to work together? Watch and find out. This is really a good and exciting movie and one I will want to watch again and again.
5,More Than Just A Cell Phone Thriller,"This is one of those movie that'll be called a ""Cell Phone Thriller"", and while that is true, this incorporates a completely different perspective by adding in the computer maniac element that I've only seen done a few times. They put some hard work into this with the excellent plot, decent casting (the acting was excellent by most of the characters), and great special effects. You will find yourself wondering how some things will happen, but compared to some other movies, this has some of the more realistic action sequences I've seen. Eagle Eye is a great movie, easy to watch and you will enjoy it."
2,Another rehash of Kubrick and 2001,"What is this, the 5000th remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey? ""Open the pod bay doors, Hal. Hal . . . Open the pod bay doors."" Even last summer's WallE was derivative of 2001, in exactly the same way. Can't someone in Hollywood be bothered to have an original thought? Apparently not.The whole premise is idiotic. Computers do what they are programmed to do. Humans are the problem. Humans are ALWAYS the problem. To paraphrase Shakespeare, ""The Fault, dear Hollywood screenwriter, lies not in our computers, but in ourselves."""
2,Don't Even Bother,"The only thing even remotely entertaining about this rather boring movie were the car chase scenes! Other than that, set your snooze alarm!"
2,Slow and plodding,"The ""big brother / computers take charge"" premise has promise but this movie does not deliver. Lots of aimless, noisy car crashes and a wandering story if not totally implausible plot. I kept checking the time on the DVD player to see when it would end. OK I guess if you have nothing else to do and want to kill two hours. BnB Beatles Depot"
1,No Charisma - None!,Why is Shia Leboff being placed in so many movies? He has zero charisma and awful hair.
1,Bad Transfer,"Whoever is making these blu rays has no quality control. The picture at tmes on the left side of the screen will disapear...this is not the only blu ray I found that this is the problem. Keep the DVD formatted disc I did. It looks, and plays great. I thought Blu ray was suppose to be better. I retuned the blu ray. Stay away from this copy!"
3,Meh......more like 2.5 stars.,"Somewhat ok if you willing to be stupid. Otherwise, preposterous, contrived, feeble, silly, dumb, intelligence-insulting, etc. You get the picture... I don't always agree with the critics, but they're right about this one. I stole a quote from another reviewer but it applies. Also, as with any other movie that has Shia LecrappyactorthatIwishwasdead, I remove 1 more star so this movie really rates 1.5"
2,2nd Hitchcock update for Shia!,"Has anyone noticed that Shia LeBeouf has done two modern updates of Hitchcock films? ""Disturbia"" is an amped-up ""Rear Window"", while ""Eagle Eye"" with the child murdering a political figure during a performance is a shoo-in for ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" meets Minority Report. It seems Shia sees himself in the mold of James Stewart / Cary Grant's bumbling and unlikely Hitchcockian heroes."
4,much better than the average review of 3 stars,"I just rented this movie last night and although I am not a Shia fan, gotta admire his agent for getting such great roles in great movies.Seriously guys, this movie is so much better than 3 stars it's not funny. The movie was absolutely non stop action and was impressed with the story imagination. I was tempted to give it 5 stars, but I just felt the Shia role could have been better casted. Anyway, great flick and definitley worth renting."
1,So much money for so little payoff,"Rarely has so much money and effort been spent for so little in return. This retreads 'War Games', but in a high-tech environment, and with none of that movie's charm."
1,Kill the director,"Ten minutes into the film I knew I was going to hate the rest of it, and I was right. I stuck through it anyway, increasingly irritated by the persistent background/foreground noise. The plot was so skinny I marvel at the people who attempted to foist it on the paying public. Okay, the successful brother has died and Shia LaBoeuf, playing his lackadaisical twin, is catapulted into a frenzy of running and dodging assaults on him during which he meets a woman who is doing the same in order to keep her son safe. It appears his brother's death is suspicious and it becomes apparent Eagle Eye, the all-seeing version of Hal the computer in the film of the future--2001--is simultaneously persecuting and saving his bacon. Why bring the living twin into it at all? He wouldn't have known anything of his brother's suspicious death if he had been let alone. But then, there wouldn't have been a movie."
1,Unwatchable,"Kept going until the last frame, but just couldn't get into this ""action"" flick. Felt like the plot was too confusing and the actions were just going through the motions. Not worth my time."
4,Computers take things literally,"What we have is a good suspension of everyday belief. Action galore, explosions, car wrecks, fast chases, excape, black-mail, Govt' secrets, and a computer that can think about the literalness of a word. The govt' computer ""Eagle Eye"" is set to kill the President and his Cabinet, by black-mailing two citizens to do the physical work and wothout knowing their real purpose to assassinate the president. Do we feel a Skynet moment here? Only on a smaller scale. We dont go to the movies for realism, we go for entertainment, and that what this movie does...entertain."
4,"Fun ""Pop Corn"" Flick","Eagle Eye stars Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan as two people who have been ""activated"" after they answer their cell phones.The person on the other end of the call gives them detailed instructions to follow. If they fail to obey, people will die. (People die because they obey but what can you do?)Billy Bob Thornton stars as the FBI agent in charge of the manhunt for the two suspected terrorists.What would you do if there was someone watching you at all times? If they had complete control of your cell phone, other's cell phones, pretty much any mechanical device...These two are thrown together to play their own parts in a master plan of assassination.Steven Spielberg acts as executive producer so you know this film will be sharp. There's something about all the films he's involved in that you can be confident they will be solid.Eagle Eye is a fun Summer pop corn flick."
5,EAGLE EYES,THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. THE ACTION STARTS AT THE BEGINNING AND WONT STOP TILL THE END. OWN IT AND THEN BOAST AND BRAG ABOUT IT.
3,I'm Sorry Dave....I Can't Do That......,"Somebody has already made the comparison between this flick and Terminator and ""SkyNet"". How about ""2001"" (HAL 9000) and ""iRobot?"" However a great example of what the government could be doing or would want to do if they had the power (processing power that is). I thought the acting was poor and a little stiff and unrealistic at times. Probably ""Enemy of the State"" is more realistic on what the government could do, although there is still a lot of fiction in that film.So...this might be good for the first viewing, but why watch it a second time? And aren't second viewings the mark of a great film?"
3,War Games for the 21st century...,"An over the top, updated version of War Games that is sometimes hard to believe but for this genre is still very enjoyable.Plus that chick is hot.Also, for those that do not live in Chicago, the Quincy Brown Line stop is about 7 miles from the Wilson Red line stop, not the 3 stops they show in the movie!"
3,This is a bit much,"This is one of those types of films that keeps you watching all the way through but where you begin to see holes even before the end. (A lot of action movies have to be seen a second time to find the holes in the plot.)Can we really be expected to believe that there are programs as sophisticated as what would have beene needed to execute a plot such as this?Can we really be expected to believe that the most efficient way for the two protagonists to find the serum that would allow them to sleep and lower their heart rate was to rob some people carrying guns large enough to blow them in half?Can we really be expected to believe that a Mother Brain computer has enough precision to make some wires fall off and kill someone in the middle of nowhere?This is a fun evening rental, but not worth a movie ticket."
1,Avoid widescreen version,"I saw the (first hour of the) widescreen DVD. It is presented in 2.35:1, but the film was obviously shot and framed at a much squarer aspect ratio. Actors heads were constantly half in and half out of frame, or sometimes chopped off at the shoulders. It's headache-inducing, after a while I could not watch any more. Avoid this version."
3,Fine,"It's a blu-ray. It does what a blu-ray does. No problems. Good Stuff. I'd buy it again, and would reccomend it."
5,movie,great movie about action and saving the world. this movie is a good way to pass a few hours and enjoy a movie.
2,Not hard to imagine the elevator pitch on this one.....,"It's Enemy of the State meets War Games via North By Northwest. This thriller starts off promisingly enough, with a hapless loser (Shia Lebeouf)thrown into a world of intrigue by an unseen puppetmaster telling him what to do. Unfortunately, the premise of an unseen force watching our characters' every move becomes less a paranoid thriller and more a lousy sci-fi/technophobe mess. While there are a few interesting action pieces, ultimately the movie falls apart under any sort of scrutiny. A slightly entertaining mess."
4,Excellent Movie Great Blu_Ray Quality,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Although I did get this at a great price from Amazon, the delivery time was ridiculous. If they cant get me a movie quicker than this again I have my doubts if I will order anything else from them."
4,Film prenant et divertissant,Blu ray avec VFF et STF pour le film et les bonus. Bon film prenant et divertissant.
2,Computer #itch.,"Eagle Eye just couldn't hold my interest. Michelle Monaghan is pretty good in this but Shia LaBeouf doesn't do it for me, not sure why he so popular, his acting isn't that spectacular. The plot is laughable but the special effects are kinda cool. Eagle Eye left me disappointed, oh well."
3,"Little Far Fetched, But Entertaining","This is a action packed movie. It goes pretty far overboard on the story line, but it is entertaining to watch.Good rental movie, but wouldn't buy it."
1,Have not received the movie yet.,"As of today, i have not received the movie i ordered. My account have shown that i paid for it. So i would either like the movie sent or my account refunded. This expeirence has lowered my faith in Amazon. I will never order anything this seller!"
1,Do not purchase from this company!!!!!!,They sent the wrong movie in the right case. I tried to contact them through a phone call but could not. I emailed them and they never contacted me!!!!!!!
1,Booooooooooooooo-Ring!,"I thought it was great when I saw in the theaters and I watched it on DVD Screener, I was bored to death! I want to break the disc and throw it out the window!"
1,Abysmal,"This movie was wretched. It contained every stupid cliche in the book combined with absurd ""special effects."" It's good for a laugh if you're watching it with friends, but otherwise, don't waste your time and brain cells."
1,Disappointing,This movie was so far fetched that it took all the enjoyment of watching it. Anyone who knows anything about technology will be sick how unbelievable it is. Not worth your time.
3,"Boy, Have We Seen This Movie Before","Lots of spoilers here, but then, isn't this movie just a pastiche of a hundred others?Billy Bob channels Tommy Lee after Harrison Ford. Shia a scruffier Matt. When computers go bad, but this time with a creepy female voice. And don't forget, speaking of bad, The Patriot Act. Hundreds of Chicago police cars in spectacular pileups. Drones destroy with incredible accuracy. We're all being watched, we're all being monitored and it's all a seamless net of spying. Overachieving brother, slacker brother just waiting for his moment. And, of course, father finally recognizes slacker gold.How does it all end? The usual way, cleaning the couch of popcorn kernels still in the grasp of a pleasant mindless buzz."
3,"""Eagle Eye"" Isn't 20/20","An overwrought disappointment, ""Eagle Eye"" has an interesting conceit--that computers are the new Big Brother of the twenty-first century--but the movie is implausible to the nth degree and incoherent, in the bargain.The car chases are dizzying and more deleterious than carsickness on account of the choppy, incomprehensible, in-your-face editing. Cars go flying through the air at all angles and I couldn't distinguish who was chasing whom. In the end, I didn't care because this farrago of crashing UFO-like cars was inducing in me a headache the size of Eagle Eye itself as I tried to sort out the mess.""Eagle Eye"" reminds me of ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" in its theme of computer domination of man, but ""Colossus"" seems much more believable--and, for that very reason, more terrifying.--Bryan Cassiday, author of ""Fete of Death"""
1,Unbelievable fantasy,"This was a bad movie because it had everything it takes to make a good movie except a 14 year old technical adviser. Any 14 year-old could have told the director/screenwriter that you cannot take $751,000 out of an ATM even if you have it in your account, that you cannot take over a commuter train by remote control, and that you cannot instantly call the cell phones of all the random people that just happen to be in the same train car as the hero. Those were just the first three problems. I wanted a thriller, not a fantasy where nothing is impossible. I don't mind Wiley Coyote running off the cliff and standing there scratching his head if I am watching a cartoon, but somebody doing the equivalent in what is supposed to be a thriller ruins it. If you can REALLY suspend disbelief this may be your movie, but if things glaringly bogus put you off, stay clear."
5,Eagle Eye,"Great film and lots of action through out. The things that the government can do from far way. I was taken by the beginning of it and I ended up loving this movie. Two people meet in the unusal way, they have to help each other. Great movie and I do recommend it to anyone."
1,Charged for Refund,I ordered a Putco 403627 Tailgate and Rear Handle Cover and a Putco 580321 Element Tinted Window Visor set of 4. For my 2012 Toyota Camry Se it said online that it fits my car. The part did not fit my car and had to be returned.I was then charged over Seven dollars to return the item. I do not feel that its fair to be charged for a mistake thats not minds and both items are still online for someone with the same car I have to order the parts and be charged to return it. Its just not fair.
2,Not what is advertised,"The web page has a ""Be sure it fit's"" pull-down, where I entered the Make, model, and sub model information to ""Be sure it fit"" ... It did not fit!! Mistakes happen. So, how come they don't return your $$$ (After receiving the returned item) to your payment method account as quckly as the snatch your $$$."
3,Item did not fit car information on line was in corect,Item was for a 2012 Camry as listed but when it arrived did not fit. Only went up to a 2011 Camry
3,"great price, 3m adhesive sucks","great price compared to my shopping, the adhesive didnt hold on a couple of windows and id have to push it out 2 roll the window up, so i took the 3m off and glue it since i dont ever plan on taking it off!"
5,Nice book.,"Like a lot of famous people, John Glenn gets fan mail and lots of it. In this book, he selects some of his favorite letters from across America and around the world ranging from the cute to the interesting to the peculiar. Topics range from one disappointed little boy whose first letter probably got lost in the deluge of mail and he didn't get a reply, to advice that John Glenn ""put his library card to use"" during his first foray into politics. This makes good reading if you've already read his autobiography and want to see some of his fans' reactions to his space flight and interactions with his fans."
2,More Faith Than Hollywood,"This book was given to me as a gift, so I guess I can't complain too much. My wife knows how much I enjoy reading Hollywood biographies, especially the early stars, so naturally she assumed I would like this one. In truth, I found myself skipping large sections of the book. This really isn't about Hollywood or Ms. Young's stellar career. Instead, it's a feel-good spiritual tome, clearly the story Ms. Young WANTS you to know. The problem is with her choice of biographer. Ms. Anderson seems a competent writer, but as she admits, this was her first biography project and she just doesn't have the critical eye. For her to make the assertion that Loretta Young, and not Katherine Hepburn, was the true love of Spencer Tracy's life is simply beyond belief.If you're a person of deep religious faith, buy this book. If not, skip it. Other than the Clark Gable angle, there's not much here."
1,A GREAT DAME,"LORETTA YOUNG WAS ALAWAYS A GREAT FAVORITE IN OUR HOME, SO NATURALLY I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS BOOK. WHAT A WASTE|MISS YOUNG COULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT SHE DID IN TV OR FILMS, IF SHE WAS AS INSIPID AS THIS BOOK PORTRAYS. SHE WAS A STRONG AND VIBRANT WOMAN OF GREAT BEAUTY AND INDEPENDENCE. A TRUE CLASS ACT. THIS BOOK DOES A DISSERVICE TO GREAT LADY."
4,"heard her son speak, sounded just like him","Made me angry with the Hayes office, but she was an extraordinary, terrific lady.I was enlightened by her guts and charm"
5,Always loved LY but now even more...,"This is one of the best biographies on a hollywood actress ever. And since it's the only one that LY authorizes herself it's worth it. It is a faith based book and Im catholic so I was definately on the same page. Dont think its a preachy gloss over though, it's not. There is not a subject that LY doesnt cover that youve wondered about. I read it in 5 days, I couldn't put it down."
5,Forever Young,"This the most memorable story of a lovely lady,,,she has run a good race and i just love her,,,God bless you Gretchen,,,intercede for us down,,,margie"
4,For Young and Old,"This is a detailed summary of the life and career of actress Loretta Young, with special emphasis on her personal religious beliefs and her contentious relationship with her foster/true life daughter. The book is well researched and presented, with plenty of photos. The price was amazingly good, and well worth the purchase."
2,A saccharine take on a gutsy woman,"I admire many things about Loretta Young. Her choice of Joan Wester Anderson as her biographer, however, reveals Miss Young's weakness for carefully airbrushing her life story. This book follows the contours of the truth but leaves out all greys and nuances, to qualify as a Reader's Digest inspirational read. The real story, with all its messy complications, would have been more interesting."
3,The Gospel According to Loretta,"This book is written through Ms. Young's eyes and appears to be her somewhat romanticized and (more importantly)spiritualized take on life. She tends to gloss over the tawdry or questionable aspects while dwelling on the spiritual aspects. Having read her daughter Judy's book, I can clearly see that there was a lot of moral conflict in her mind and this book was clearly a good way to absolve herself of most of the negatives in her life. That said, the book is an o.k. read once you begin to differentiate the truth from the romantic fiction."
4,Great recovery,"She is not like you would have imagined from the TV Show. She had a lot more going on than the glamour that she displayed with her swirling entries each week.She was not the angel one might think either but she was human and she faced it, or not, within the pages of this book. She sometimes came off as a saint and sometimes as naive but you did not always believe she could be THAT naive. Other times she came of as competent and adult, which, in my book makes her as real as a Hollywood siren can be."
3,Rationalization - for a less than proper life,"The author rationalized Ms. Youngs transgressions by continuing remind the reader what a faithful christan Ms. Young was.The book was an easy read, several interesting side stories of Hollywood during the 30's and 40's.kt"
3,lovely,i felt there is more to this story to tell it left me with a feeling there is a lot more to tell
4,You'll never look at your cat or dog the same way again,"So many subsequent books on animal behaviour have quoted this book and no wonder. He has such a love of his subjects and it shines through his observations one their day to day behaviour to one another and to their human companions.If you've ever looked at your pet and asked, ""Why did he do that?"" Then read this book."
3,"outdated, though still worth a read","Lorenz is a keen observer of dog behavior and a wonderful teller of tales. On that level, the book is very enjoyable and highly recommended. Where is comes up short, though, is in the science.While his many tales are very insightful, they are not necessarily indications of general behavior. And though the book is a wealth of information, some information is clarified or discredited by more recent research (see Desmond Morris' DOGWATCHING and Stephen Budiansky's THE TRUTH ABOUT DOGS). His jackal/wolf theory about dog evolution, in particular, is invalid. He gives some valuable information about dog ownership, though this book is not a complete guide to owning a dog."
4,Great Game for people with little time,"This game ""was"" really cool. The graphics were awesome and so was the story line. But, it was really short. Only nine stages! But what I like is that after you beat the story line, you could fight as the Zeons. As I was saying, the game did not take very long to beat. The game only took me two days. (and I'm not an obsessive gameplayer.) The best way to get the hang of piloting the Gundam, is to beat stage 2 and pratice on that stage. Other that the game was great. But, if I could change it, I would try and get more stages on it."
1,Pure torture,"I bought this game the same day I bought my PS2, it (...). Needless to say it's the only PS2 game I've felt the need to trade in.If you like Gundam, you'll probably love it anyway, so my warning to you will probably go unheaded. (...), if you are going to buy it, you may as well buy it used because every store I've seen that sells used PS2 games has piles of this game lying around (I wonder why???).As a video game, it just wasn't fun and I found the controls were ackward and the graphics aren't that great for a PS2 game.I really really did try to like this game, but just coulldn't.There are so many better videogames out there for the PS2, don't waste your time on this one."
4,"Controls Really, Really, ...","When I first got this game i thought it would be great, well it turned out i would be wrong. I popped it in my PS2 and started Playing it and i was totally dissapointed! To fire you have to ress R3(the right analog stick). It is like an arcade game to me and i hate arcade games! I was hoping you could be like any Gundam you wanted, WRONG! I turned the game back in and got my money back and decided to by Zeonic Front and that is pretty good so far. If i was you and was hooked on Mobile Suit Gundam i would just get Zeonic Front, although you may be the bad team on Zeonic FRont it rocks! Out of a 1-10 i would give it a seven!"
1,This game stinks.,This is the worst game ever created. Gundam may be a good tv series but the game is junk. Don't buy this game!
5,The best action/adventure game ever.,"To me this game is indescribable. The graphics are stunning, and I usualy don't like polygon graphics. The controller settings are kind of strange but every thing else is perfect. I'm a very big MS GUNDAM fan and I am very pleased with Bandai, it is much better than Battle Assult."
2,gundam review,"First i would like to say something if your not into gundam avoid this game now and go buy zoe cause thats a good mech game,But for gundam fans read keep reading.Well, i would like to start with some bad things of the game the thing that i most notice are the graphics they are so bad that it looks like a ps game more than a ps2 then comes the control well let me tell you that the control is badder than armored cores control and you youst dont feel that your hurting the bad guy i would not call it a simulation game.the good things? ohhh youst the cinemas and the extras.youst dont buy the game."
4,short and sweet,"This is a VERY good game. it is a bit easy but it is still fun. I rented the game and beat it in a few days but after you beat the game you get to do this thing where you get to use all of the other moble suites ( guncannon, zaku, and even one of the suites from 08 ms team).you should rent first. but it is a very good game so you might want to buy it. REMEMBER MY FAVORITE QUOTE: When there is great power there are great opportunities to abuse that power."
2,Eye-candy but not much beyond that.,"Starting off with the positives, it is a very nice graphical game. Very nice cutaway movie scenes in story mode, which provide something of a history/detail for those not familiar with Gundam. In game graphics are very nice. Not the absolute best, but very nicely done. Sound effects are pretty good too. Explosions look read, weapon firing is nice, and collapsing buildings during combat look pretty good.However, the controls of the game are absolutely HORRIBLE. The potential of it being a great game goes out the window with this very bad control set up. Very difficult to control the Gundam suit in the more advanced levels, where control is needed. The ""targeting"" option was a total waste to include, for it targets where the enemy used to be (after they move the instant you fire) rather then following.Lousy controls make the game almost unplayable. The excellent graphics were wasted because of this. The game goes back on the shelf to collect dust."
4,One of the best games but something is missin,I have this game and I have to say the challenges are great and amazing. However it lacks a more indepth story line and allowing us to play only certain battles. After beating the game you get a sense that you have more to go after. Well their is. The graphics is great but making it more interactive with the story line would be great.
4,It's a good game.......... but needs more levels,"This game is relly awesome because of the graphics,gameplay, and storyline. I am big Gundam fan and all but I think they should of added more levels to it, I mean only nine levels, NINE!!!!and the series has 43 episodes. But it is an all right game cause I like it when u finish the story mode u can watch clips from the animated series and hear the BGM(Back Ground Music)plus u get a bonus game mode that u can choose to fight as the Zeons or the Earth Fediration.I would recommend this game if your a gundam fan or u just like games that u can just blow things up. So its a good game after all, but it just needs more levels and i'll be saving up for the next Gundam game which will be:Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front, for the Playstation 2 only and avilible in October."
4,This will be fun IF you can configure the controls!,"I played this at Gundam Invasion Tour when it came to San Diego. It's a good game, much along the same lines as Armored Core 2 for the PS2. To say that the graphics are a million times better than Mechwarrior II though, is a bit of an exageration. MWII had anti-aliasing (if you had the hardware), and this game doesn't, at least the demo that I played didn't... maybe the final will. Also, if you can't configure the controls, then I may be VERY disappointed with the game... The way the controls were set up is:Digital pad controlled forward/backward and rotate left/right. Right Analog controlled head movement Left Analog did nothing as far as I could tell. L1 R1 were strafe left and right R2 and the X O square and triangle did different attacks one of the regular buttons was for thrusters (jump jets)there is also a lock on button but I can't remember what it was. I just really hope that they let you customize your controls."
3,Could have been much worse,"This is my second Gundam game, and I liked that it contained dubbed cutscenes from the animated series, which I have yet to watch. Fans will love that the dub keep all the voice actors from the show.Overall, I liked the game, but there are much better mecha fighters out there with better graphics and controls, and hopefully, better protagonists. This one was whiny and annoying at times. But if you don't own a PS2 yet, than I guess this is a good way to start you Gundam collection."
4,Okay For The First 2nd Gen Gundam Game,"This was actually the first Gundam Game i've played, so here is my reveiw. Gameplay was good for my taste, and the graphics back then were awsome to me. If your not a gundam fan, thats not a problem here, story mode features cut scenes from the show, from the beginning all the way to the end. And mission mode will introduce you to other Gundam Series set in the UC, most notably Blue Destiny. There are even trailers of the other sereis if your interested in Gundam and wanna check it out. Overall I gave this game a 4/5 for pretty good graphics, fun story mode, & ummmm well its Gundam."
2,Nice production but bad gameplay,"This game looks decent but not up to PS2 standards. The gameplay sucks-no analog support for moving your mech. The auto targeting is worthless against anything that moves. The mech moves so slow, too slow to fit any fighting game genre but unfortunately that's all this game is in the end. The anime and pure CG stuff does look good and justifies the DVD palyback hardware in the PS2. Only Gundam fans will like this. Anyone else that says it's good is lying or stupid."
2,Not Recommended,"This game was rather poorly constructed with graphics hardly worthy of the PS2 console, awkward controls, and it's stunning simplicity. The only reason i rated it 2 stars was the cut scenes were ok. as an original gundam fan, i don't recommend this game for any but the hardcore gundam fans, and even then, mostly for the cut scenes and parts from original series. don't expect much from the gameplay. BEWARE!!!!!"
2,"Good Mecha, bad game","Since PS2 came out on the market, I have played pretty much every game for PS2. Some were good, some were bad, and some were TERRIBLE!!!. I have been a fan of Gundam since i was little and i was so excited that Bandai was making a game with the original Gundam story!!! I bought this game as soon as it came out and played for a couple hours. However, i was very disappointed and ended up not playing it anymore. here are the reasons...1. Terrible control...2. Short, VERY short. it mostly plays video clips and you don't get to play the actual game much.3. Terrible voice acting....4. PS1 level of graphic...."
2,OHHHHH NO ANOTHER GAME SLOW,"This game is poor..., i buy this game because a person of a shop(i dont want to tell)tell me that is cool, but it..., i recommend to see the review first.To control the character is very slow and the graphics...is like ps ! In my opinion DON'T BUY THIS GAME or you are a stupid!"
5,Wonderfully relaxing for all ages!,"I purchased this CD to use for a master's report on lullabies and the developing human brain. Twin Sisters are now my highest rated producers of lullabies for our little one's growing brains. They use real instruments and have 34 hymns that flow seamlessly together. I have all my little ones listen to it and they relax and enjoy the music during nap time and night time. There are no singers on the CD, but beautiful arrangements all in relaxing keys. Such a great find!"
1,Can you see some video?!!!!,"I bought this camera on line for $125.00 that also includes shipping. I read all reviews and information on the camera and thats why i bought it. I finaly got the camera and set it all up and viewed it on my tv to see how it looks, I was so angry on the quality of the video I called the store for a refund, they told me ""no, not on electronics"" My web cam that i paid $40.00 has a better quality video than this junk. The audio even sucks it has a hissing sound, I had to turn the volume down on the tv to not hear it. I will never, never again buy this type of camera and also will not recomend it. Don't waste your money!!!!"
5,A real page-turner!,"I got this book when I was still in elementary school...I am now 21. I found it again when I was cleaning my room some time ago and decided to read it again! This book is an excellent book to keep a child reading! I have read this book five times or more since I was about 9 or 10 years old. I urge anyone who likes a good story to pick this book up, but don't intend to be able to put it down!"
3,Terrified me as a child,"I was 7 years old when this book was first published. A friend from school who knew knew I liked to read loaned it to me when we were in the second grade.It *terrified* me. I never even finished reading it and it gave me nightmares. I even went into my parents room after I woke up from the nightmare.I am now 25 years old and I have still never finished reading this book. But every time I would describe it and try to remember the title, people would insist it was ""The Dollhouse Murders"". I am strangely glad I found the title again that terrified me so much as a child.But I probably still won't ever finish it."
2,Time Windows,"So it seems that most readers really enjoyed Time Windows, and I have to wonder if they've read any of Reiss's other books. For a more juvenile crowd, I suppose Time Windows would be more appealing, but for the most part, I felt that it was a lot worse than her other books. It's just not as interesting, with a lot of down-time. The big mystery doesn't really kick in majorly until halfway through the book. The characters are pretty cookie-cutter, uninteresting, standard characters, nothing special. Parts are very predictable (although some of the bigger twists at the very end, they are pretty impossible to predict). It's really just not Reiss's best work, and the ending left me cringing--worse even than the ""it was all a dream"" ending.Rating: I'd say 2/5 compared to her other books, 3/5 in general."
2,"Moral Realism, A Defense",I found the arguments remarkably incomplete; a somewhat simplistic treatment of a very interesting subject.
4,Perfect tennis socks in spite of confusing sizing,"First of all, these socks are perfect for tennis! I will never go back to cheaper socks now that I have the size I need. Secondly, the sizing is all wrong. The 'Product Details' section shows this:""Size 11 fits shoe 5.5-8.5; size 13 fits 9-12.5; size 15 fits 13-15""I usually wear a size 11 tennis shoe, so naturally I bought their size 13. It was WAY too big. So I tried the size 11 which fit perfectly. My advice is to ignore their sizing chart and just buy the size that corresponds to your shoe size. If you're a size 12, their size 13 would probably be good. But if you're smaller than that (10 - 11 1/2), I would go with their size 11. One final thing: Wash the socks before the first use. They seemed to be coated with a chemical of some kind which made them slippery until after I had washed them."
4,Thorlo Black socks,These are very comfortable and last a long time. Not inexpensive but worth it. Fit is nice and lots of cushioning.
5,Great socks!,I have a small injury in one of my soles and I needed extra support for the pain. I Loved the extra cushion and comfort when running!
3,"I Love Lewis, But I Only Like This Album","You gotta love Lewis Black. Its very rare that you see someone who so gets so angry so easily. Not to mention he's one of the absolute funniest comics working today.With that said, I was a bit disappointed in this album. I'm not saying that it isn't funny, its just that alot of the material here is pulled from his previous 3 albums. I'd say its about 40% old stuff, and 60% new stuff. His new riffs are great. Very funny stuff about mostly politics from his insane point of view. Its a very good cd. I couldn't not recommend it. But it was just disappointing that I had heard so much of it before."
3,all time hits,"This title of the CD is missleading. you will find all the material on the CD on all his previous CD's. It is a good cd though, but all his old work is on it."
3,We know now Lewis,"This CD is still very funny, but most of the jokes are not very new. He has either used them on some DVD's or CD's or goes on about the same subject.It seems every show has some remarks about the Superbowl, and even though this is about the famous Justin and Janet halftime show we get it now.Get his other CD's first"
3,Better visually,"Lewis Black is extremely funny, even on CD. However, his humor tranlates better when you can see him!"
5,"Lewis Black......a funny, funny man!","Laughed until I almost peed myself. Not for Republicans (unless you want to hear the truth instead of Fox propoganda). And don't worry, he slams Dems just as much, it's just that we understand our party isn't infallable and we can laugh at its many shortcomings (which he always points out). Language is course and at times unneccesary, but very, very, very funny stuff."
1,"All Talk, No Action","This is probably the worst children's book I have ever read, and as an elementary school teacher, I have read more than my share of children's books. There isn't any plot to speak of, and most of the book consists of cutsey characters delivering long new-agey monologues. It is my understanding that the secret to writing good fiction is ""show, don't tell""; in other words, your narrative should make clear the points you are trying to make without your explicitly stating them. This book violates that rule on every single page, with excruciatingly boring results."
3,Interesting but badly written,"If you're hoping for a tie-in between philosophy and quantum physics, look elsewhere. The author explicitly excludes that from his discussion right in the introduction.It is not always very well written. Especially the second half is a bit rambling and disjoint. Nevertheless, Shrodinger's philosophy is interesting. A westerner's take on monism such as that found in Advaita Vedanta."
4,Ephemeris 2000 - 2009,I'd like to know if the book Ephemeris 2000 - 2009 have latitude and declination of the planet. Thank You. Paolo
3,Cushy contours,"Gently refining his already accessible electronic-pop into the most radio ready incarnation yet, Styrofoam still seems to come up short of great work, producing a few standout tracks and a majority of pleasant emo-electro generic-isms."
2,BETTER DEAL: 5 DVDs for about $30 including this DVD.,"Amazon is about to release this movie La Piscine (Swimming Pool in English) along with 4 other grand thriller for ONLY $30 . Just look under Alain Delon in DVD or ""Movies and TV"" and you will see a blue cover with ""La Piscine"", ""Le Gitan"", ""Diabolically Yours"", ""La Veuve Couderc"", ""Notre Histoire"".It is just available recently, after I bought the German release (the one with photo shown here is Out-of-Print)."
4,Favorite skillet,"I love this skillet! Just wish it was a bit larger for our family of five. Also, I am using this skillet on a smooth cooktop and it works great. I just take care to place it on the surface gently."
5,Enameled cast iron skillet,"When I got my new glass cooktop I had to replce my regular cast iron skillets with this type of frypan. This was a gift, and I love it. (A larger size choice would be even nicer.)"
2,"1-2 Stars, Terrible. So many songs and only 3 decent tracks out of 40!! Don't buy this! Disc 2 has ZERO worthwhile songs","The title says it all. There are two-three good songs on disc one which you may already own, otherwise the remianing songs are terrbile, so bad I didn't bother to rip any on CD 2... I only ripped a few tracks on CD 1. Out of 40 songs, this is a waste of money. There are few CD's I can write this bad of a review, but these are some of the worst dance songs and mixes in a long time. SKIP THIS! Ugh......"
4,great cheese from Italy,"The cheese is quite unique in flavor, these artisans deserve every penny, if you think the cheese is difficult to make you should see how they grow grapes to make their unique wine!Try it and support the slow food movement."
1,You get what you pay for,Car charger I think was for a Nokia not a Motorola. The case/cover did not fit(not even close). Didn't even try the ear piece. Return everthing to Amazon they charged me $2.00 for some sore of restocking fee? So in the end I lost money for something that didn't fit or work on my phone.
3,Value for money,"The product is value for money. I have been using all the three items for past 3 weeks, no complaints what so ever"
4,Fine product,"This was a useful, if not perfect product. I'm using the case & charger. (The ear bud didn't fit in my ear correctly.) I got my money's worth so far!"
1,This is garbage!,"I bought the three piece multipack. The power supply doesn't work at all, the earbud is barely audible, and the case is too tight to put the phone in. This stuff is worse than dollar store junk. I can't return it because I opened it so I'll just throw it in the trash."
1,Don't BUY,"This is an horrible Item, the main reason i went for this product was to save some money. But when i bought it, the ear phones were not working and leather case was of worst quality.So don't buy it!!!!"
1,For the love of God why?,"Okay. First of all, when your band is called ""Nemesis 3"" and your album is called ""Scream as Needed,"" it's usually expected of you to bring some kind of aggression or danger to your music. Maybe even a little actual screaming. Too bad these guys completely fail at it. For the entire album, all the lead singer does is pout about how people don't like him, people care too much about money, his girlfriend doesn't love him and blah blah blah we've heard it all before so shut the hell up!Now if they could just be inspired to write some decent songs, that would be a different story. But of course they don't. There's nary a decent riff to be found on this album, let alone a melody. Although after half an album of aimless sophomoric self-pitying ""rocking,"" ""Head"" is actually kind of good. Unfortunately, that doesn't come close to redeeming the whole."
4,They Work,I only expected one and got 6 when I ordered. Nothing else to say about functionality or design. They work.
2,very disappointed,"thought i had struck gold-wrong-it boils over very easy when you are trying to get it hot to boil for steam-after having it on the burner for two days, i thought ok time to pour it out and start again with fresh water-i had put olive oil in with the first 2 quarts of water-so i thought it would be seasoned enough to stop rusting-wrong-my husband was next to me at the sink when i tried to lift the kettle and empty it in the sink-the handle gave way and i was burnt by the steam- i let go---the handle came out of the kettle lip it was in-i was terrified-why these people cannot spend enough money to make these handles safe==I DO NOT UNDERSTAND!!!"
1,Designed To Boil Over,"If you put more than three cups of fluid in this piece of trash it will boil over. There's no way to pour anything without leaking all over the place. I like to make my coffee cowboy style (just put the grounds directly in the pot). I thought this would be a great thing to use. After three messes, I'll never use it again. Absolutely the poorest design I've ever seen. Not only is it a mess on the stove, but you have to pour out your cup over the sink, because if you don't, It'll leak out all over the place. I feel ripped off and I usually don't give anything a bad review. It's well made, but cast iron is hard to screw up."
4,Kettle is working on a woodstove to humidify the house!,This was a Christmas gift to my daughter who uses it on a cast iron fireplace insert to humidify the house... she is happy with the kettle.
2,INSTITUTIONAL; NOT TOO HELPFUL FOR PARENTS,"I guess the title should have warned me: CHILDCARE feeding guide. This book is not for parents trying to feed their own kids healthy meals; it is geared toward a daycare setting. Most of the book centers on the logistics of meal preparation (e.g. sanitary food-handling) and common sense dietary information (eat lots of vegetables!). The few recipes that are included don't sound very appealing, plus they feed 8-12 children. If I were a daycare provider I might have given this book 5 stars, but it's not very helpful for a family."
2,one cut 2 stars,"as I have only herd one cut ( point of no return ) which Ienjoyed,enough to purchase,complete review will come after."
3,Some Good Songs and a Few Groaners,"Good old Harry. Great versions of his most famous songs, but there are a few on there that do not survive well to the present day. Just play your favorites, or enjoy them all with some good friends and plenty of rum!"
1,Harry Belafonte,"The sound is terrible. I know the music is old, but I did expect better quality. Poor Harry! This does not do him justice"
5,Truly good relaxing 40s music. Very hip. Full of style.,"If you want a great swingin' cd, this is it. The song ""Blue Skies"" is one of my all time favorites."
5,Highly recommended to all music lovers.,"Ritchie Fliegler cuts right to the heart of Rock & Rock. That ""sound."" He describes the efforts of many to capture that sound. In this digital crazy world, it is refreshing to read about those who spend a life's effort trying to create a totally subjective, analog product that cannot be graphed, charted, or placed into another database. When that ""sound"" is heard---the amplifier's designer knows he's onto something very good. It's that simple. Yet, not an easy task. Fliegler's writing is unpretentious. He has a pure love of the amplifier's role in Rock & Roll. This helps to emphasize the luck and persistence needed by these amplifier designers. It's nice to read about people dedicated to their jobs. Not for money or power, but for the passionate pursuit of an elusive goal. I highly recommend this book. You do not need to be a musician nut to enjoy it. It reveals just how important that ""sound"" was to the history of Rock, as the Rock groups, themselves."
4,Ever heard of Peavey,"Very interesting book, but I've heard that there's a little company in Mississippi that has made a few amps. How can a book about guitar amplifiers leave out one of the largest producers in the industry?"
3,OK,We do an Oktoberfest every year and we have a guest who is a German lady and she said: this 'just did not cut it'.
1,Whatever.,"I like metal, I really do...but I hate this band. If I could give no stars I would.There's this joke among guitar players: Thrash metal guitarists don't know which notes to play, so they just hit all of them.This rings true. My ex played the track where Sin leads a la Yngwie Malsteem and turned to me when it was over. She asked me, ""Wasn't that awesome?"" and got this confused look on her face when I started laughing. If you want to listen to actual music, look elsewhere. Guh."
3,Excitement of Learning,When I received the book I was excited about the possibility of learning the Fulani Language. Imagine my surprise when I opened the book to find out that it was not in english-Fulani-English but just Fulani-English which added to the challenge.I heartily recommend this book as it will assist in the learning of the language and the ever important phrases that are needed
2,Not for Classical,"I have a nylon string Cordoba A/E Classical Guitar... it has a different size hole than standards! I know... this makes me the dope, but I wish somewhere I would have seen that specified. Wasn't worth the cost of shipping it back, so now I just have a rubber circle."
1,VERY CONFUSING,I CAN NOT EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THIS IT IS NOT A GOOD BUY AND NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL
5,Totally magical,"This is all of Harry's finest,including ""Spaceman"",an underated all-time gem.I recommend this magical/creative madness to all music collectors."
5,Very informative!,"Wow, I was really impressed with the way this book tells you how to care for your Corn snakes. It has everything covered, this is the book to get if your going to own a Corn snake. It tells you everything from what to put your snake in to what kind of parasites your snake could get.This book even tells you how to know when your snakes are getting ready to breed! There are a few really good books out there for Corn snakes but this one is my favorite."
4,Very Specific for somebody who is slightly familiar w/ snakes,"My family is in the market for a ""Corn."" We are actually looking to purchase one from the author of the book. It is very descriptive and detailed. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because we've never owned a snake and I think a check-list on what is recommended to buy before your snake arrives should've been included, along with how often to clean the aquarium and exactly how to clean it (just scoop out individual messes, or the whole she-bang). Anyway. It's excellent and informative and highly recommended!"
5,This Is A Great Book!,This is a great book for beginner corn snake owners. It is a very thorough and comprehensive guide. My 11-year-old son had no trouble reading it as well. I would recommend it for anyone interested in learning about or keeping corn snakes. I often refer back to it when I have an issue with my snakes.
4,Calling all corn snake enthuastics!,"This book has great information on care of corn snakes, in fact for me it went overboard with the breeding of them, which is not bad, just more information than I could absorb. The authors (whom I have seen lecture as well) are passionate about the breeding and keeping of corn snake. This is a must for anyone considering keeping one of these guys as a pet"
2,corn snakes,item is fine. Did not ship when promised. I paid extra for expedited shipping and did not get it.
1,it's not speedotron bran. It's generic :(,I Was disappointed when i realized that this wasn't an speedotron but a generic brand. They sell this ítem as a speedotron but is a the Morris Co. Brand.
2,janemi,"The cards are very nicely done but, no one, let alone a 3-year old, could ever hold such huge cards in their hands. After I received these cards in the mail, I went to our local toy store and bought cards for $.99 cents in order for them to fit into my 6- and 8-year old grandchildren's hands. I would not recomment this product...cards are extremely large."
2,Dissappointed,"My daughter had a set of cheap playing cards she loved but they were falling apart quickly. I have bought a lot of Melissa and Doug toys for my kids over the years and was excited to find these.Pros:Very well built sturdy cardsCons:Way too big for children's hands, too big for my hands and I have large hands.The art work is so stylized that it can be difficult to discern what animal is on the card. I dislike the artwork very much.I don't think these were well thought out for children. I realize now that eeboo cards are what I was looking for."
1,Most ridiculous idea ever!,"What great brain trust would think that ""jumbo cards are perfect for little hands""?Luckily they were cheap, or I'd be sending them all back. Now it's just not worth the trouble. My 7 year old granddaughter needs to lay the cards on the table in front of her just to see what all she has, and it's impossible to play the games.I'm now looking for ""normal size"" or ""small size for little hands"". Stupid idea!"
3,Classic card games - three still too young for playing,"I like the Melissa and Doug products, and when Christmas shopping I stumbled upon this three pack of card games. These are classic games that kids will enjoy. The cards are durable, large, and well illustrated. The drawbacks include the recommended ages. It is recommended for ages three and up; however, the games (especially animal rummy) were too complicated for my three year old who has to have an adult help her play. The large cards are suppose to be easy for small hands; however, in my experience, it is actually harder for my child to hold all of the large cards in her small hands at once. I would wait and purchase this product when your child is older - maybe closer to five. I still like the cards, and we will play with them as a family."
4,Durable and High Quality,"These are nicely priced, beautifully illustrated, fun card games for young kids. The cards are large and easy to handle. And the images on them really make the fun value for my young daughter. We especially like the Go Fish game since all the numbered cards are illustrated with fun sea animals and she loves marine life.I'm very glad I purchased this! They are holding up well under repeated plays and the price was right!"
5,Especially love Go Fish!,"I have given this card set to all my young nieces and nephews. So much fun! Beautiful pictures and durable cards! Sometimes, we take the Go Fish cards and match them up like the game Memory. I have seen kids from age 4 to age 10 enjoy these card games!I also love Memory.Original Memory"
5,Awesome set of cards!,I recently bought this set of cards for my almost 4 yr old along with the little hands card holder and she loves them. She is able to play GO FISH and OLD MAID but the Animal Rummy is a little above her so I play a matching game with those cards that she loves. The cards are big and the pictures are vibrant and cute! The only thing is that the box that they come in can be destroyed easily but other than that they're great. You can clean even the cards by wiping them with a wet cloth. We love it!
4,"still talent out there,not just pop queens.","The more I listen to this band the harder it is to listen to anything else, their just that good! They have changed from their first releases, but are truly finding their direction. try any of their cd's you will not be disapointed."
2,Mission Control...we have a problem!,"Having seen the very nicely produced HDNet WMV-HD title ""Shuttle Discovery's Historic Mission"", I was keen to see this title as well. I figured that since it came with a standard definition DVD, it was extra bang-for-the-buck, and it would make a nice demo disc in my home theater.Much to my disappointment (and surprise), this standard-definition DVD is mastered in a letterboxed 4:3 aspect-ratio, not anamorphic widescreen 16:9 like the original high-definition source! What the...?! To add insult to injury, the 4:3 transfer is pretty p*ss poor at that, with oversaturated colors one minute and washed out black levels the next on an ISF-calibrated HD display. Hardly the quality one should get from a down-converted HD source. Ouch!"
5,Fly!!!!,This book was really good. It gave an inside on how michael jordan was able to become the greatest player and still didnt let up. I had to do a report on this and i got a good grade on it
4,Michael Jordan,This book was an awesome book. It has a bunch of information about Michael Jordan throughout his whole life. It has information from when he was a young boy all the way into the NBA. I definitly recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in Michael Jordan or that is a fan of the NBA. This is a well written story that has great facts and stats of Michael Jordan.
5,Worked exactly as I expected,"I bought this product, because I have a car radio with usb support on the back and I don't like the raw end of a cable sticking out somewhere in the car. (glove box in this case) So I bought this and installed it in a plastic trim plate. It works perfectly and gives a clean finished look to the usb. The only thing I would do differently is have a bit longer cord. (I had to use an extender) But other than length, this was the perfect solution to mu problem."
2,Stay away,"I've used Money 99 thru 2002 and this latest is terrible. I liked the old programs, but this new one is filled with bugs. It has deleted one of my accounts three times for no obvious reason and I've had major problems generating reports (program locks up). Spent days trying to figure that one out and support site was not helpful at all. Additionally, when you import *.qif files from your bank, the new interface is horrible. It trys to be too smart and puts things in the wrong place and changes transactions. I liked the older versions a lot but I definately can't recommend this. I'm uninstalling this and putting my stuff back on Money 2000. FYI, I did install this on my Windows 2000 machine and it ran fine (except when the program crashed). Did the exact same thing on my Windows 98SE machine."
1,"Danger Will Robinson, Danger !!","This version of Money upgrades to a new communications protocol between you and your bank. It is NOT fully debugged, and has many limitations, including only letting you transmit one electronic payment at a time. If you are an existing Money user, stick with your current version until the bugs are worked out. Not even Microsoft tech support could solve my issues on this one.... I am going back to Money 2001."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!,"I am not one of those Microsoft haters. I have found their products to be generally very good, BUT not with Money 2002. I have used Microsoft Money for five years. My last upgrade was 2000, and it was just fine. I recently purchased a new computer that had 2002 installed. So I upgraded, being happy with the previous upgrades. It is a nightmare. Microsoft has taken every convenience and removed it. Instead of being able to send all your on line payments at once. Each one is sent individually. What were they thinking?! It's also loaded with ads. I've paid already, I don't need ads. Also, when upgrading it corrupted my files. When I tried to return to the stable and friendly Money 2000, I was informed that I could no longer use on line banking services because my account had already been upgraded. No turning back. Now I'm stuck with some sadist's version of ease. STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Do Not Use this product (Even if it is free!),"This product is terrible. I was suckered in with the free rebate that they offered with the H&R Block Tax Program (Another terrible program when compared to Turbo Tax). I have had nothing but problems and it is not operator error (I am a computer programmer). The program constantly complains that it cannot project financial data so I am constantly clicking through error messages. Microsoft posted a ""fix"" for this. The ""fix"" did not work! Minutes ago, I tried to create a 401(k) retirement account and I got a vague message saying ""Operation Cannot be Performed"". Moreover, it constantly prods you to get a passport account, which as most technically adept people know, is a tool that essentially allows access to all your accounts with ONE password. This is a terrible idea since if the system is compromised, every account you have is compromised as well. Go with Quicken, it cannot be any worse than this."
3,Windows 2000 workaround,"That is a problem if it won't allow you to run the application without admin privaledges, but there is a workaround. Setup the application as the admin (by hitting the setup.exe with a shift right click, run as, input the admin credentials and select the checkbox to always run as administrator). An imperfect solution for an imperfect world."
3,Just OK,"I am not completely happy with this product which, after so many editions, should be nearing perfection for such a simple program. I have found that printing checks to be a pain... It should be so simple and yet, the layout choices they have provided don't work for pre-printed checks. Everything else is like before a good basic program."
2,More bugs than Windows XP.,Bought this when it first came out to replace Quicken (too slow).More fool me - ghastly interface. More bugs than an ant hill and now it won't let me edit or view downloaded info and I've now got 78 items on one account needing 'previewing'.I'd move the file back to Quicken but guess MS Money has now ballsed up my accounts so badly I'd be better off starting again.
1,waste of money,"very complicated for nothing. i was only looking for a software that'll guide me through a better expense management & reduce debts in a longer term, but this piece of [junk] has so much to offer you and doesn't even respond to your needs! too many useless functions available & worthless data collection that leads you to nowhere!"
1,Not compatible with Win2k - BEWARE,"Although this product will install under Win2k, it is not *certified* as Win 2k compliant and so, it will not run properly under Win2k. Only Microsoft could produce a product that doesn't run right under their own O/S. Incredible. You must be logged in as ""Administrator"" or someone in ""Administrator"" group in order to run this at all. See MS knowledgebase article Q273815 for a detail of the problems you may encounter (this for Money 2001, but it holds true for 2002 too). I bought 2001 and was burned by this incompatibility and had to revert to Money 2000. Don't buy this if you run Win2k unless you want to make a charitable donation to Microsoft. MS says they have no intention of making Money Win2k certified as Win2k is a ""business"" O/S and Money is a ""consumer"" product. Caveat emptor."
1,This is a really terrible bugful software,"I use computer since Apple ][ era and never seen such a terrible comercial product. After install, I can't even start the program. Everytime I tried to start it, there's an ""Error report"" dialog, and that's it. Nothing more....How can Microsoft sell a product like this? This is not a beta, and not even a ""first generation"" product. *sigh*I'll try quicken next time..."
2,Integrity of the MS Money file system is dubious,"Having skipped all previous versions of MS Money, I thought I would switch from Quicken, which I hate, for MS Money 2002. Given 40 billion reasons to trust this product, I devoted some time to it, but now find I hate it too. Why? Here's my story:Step 1: Install-->> PassStep 2: Configure your accounts, download data -->> PassStep 3: Configure sub accounts -->> PassStep 4: Use routinely and check account information -->> FailStep 5: Spend hours troubleshooting, repairing, fixing -->> Fail, couldn' fix a sub-account that would show no data.Step 6: Either switch to paper/pencil accounting or try out GNU Cash.Maybe the next version has fixed the bugs. For me, I have given up on MS Money 2002."
2,Not the original artists,"Although this is a decent ""sound-alike"" compliation album, I felt that this was a case of ""bait and switch."" The original artists are given credit, and the works are ""used by permission,"" but the music is clearly performed by someone other than the original artists - and no credit is given to whoever is performing the tracks. I gave it 2 stars because it is very listen-able, but I prefer the ""Dove Awards"" compilation albums - with the original music by the original artists. This is one time I regretted buying on-line. If I had seen this in the store, I would not have purchased it."
3,Old times call for open minds,"Impossible to review and I will not express my personal opinion, however I will state a fact or two. In 1930 also today people are right to be weary of talking about Voodoo-Hoodoo if they really know anything at all, it was not and is still not uncommon in New Orleans to tell 'any ole tale' to get a novice off your back. So read between the lines here if you really want to get some idea about New Orleans Voodoo of the time.So what if Robert was almost close to 'some' of the truth ? What would you call a working mother with 2 jobs 15 children a community leader a plague nurse with no edcuation who may have signed her name as X ? with no mobile phone or email, should I go on ?....Probally the most inspirational woman in American history. I will leave it at that."
2,not impressed,"I was given a First Edition of this book by a friend who knows that I practice Vodou and Rootwork. It is a fascinating story, but sadly the author focuses on ""wild orgies"" and ""blood drinking negros"". It was written in the 30s and does indeed reflect the ""taste"" of this period as well as the prejudice attitude towards Voodoo and Vodou in that time."
2,Oh Well,"I was expecting this book to be extremely interesting and I am so disappointed. I was reading the back of the book which says ""the author creates a vivid, haunting atmosphere, which holds the reader in spell..."" Whatever...it is slow paced and it's boring. I'm only half-way through with the book and the way it's going now...I don't know if I will finish it. There may be other books out there about Marie Laveau that will leave you spellbound...Please let me know..because this is not it."
4,A very interesting version of Cinderell,"this is another interesting version of Cinderella, but it also plays off of Shakespeare's King Lear. Look for the reference, shakespeare buffs and I am sure that you will find it. I really think that this books opens up a non-western tale in a traditional way that children will understand."
4,cinderella rides again,Cinderella tales have been found from almost every land and culture. This Cinderella story is another treasure for those who enjoy fairy tales and studying cultural influence on them.
5,The Jewish Cinderella,"This book is somewhat similar to the Cinderella that I know, but it has a different twist. It combines Cinderella and the Jewish culture. I will leave the rest for you, the reader, to find out what goes on the book."
4,A must-read for the modern era,"The tired argument that Israelis target civilans is ridiculous. Who else warns civilians before entering, and faces a cowardly ""army"" who wears civilian clothes is only a P.R statement by terrorists and not to be believed.These are difficult times, and if a temporary limiting of personal freedoms is what it will take to rid the world of these new fascists and rerrorists, then it will have to be done. Mr. Dershowitz captures the essence of the problem, and offers concrete solutions. Imagine the ""solutions"" if and when the Islamists take over. Holocaust, anyone???"
1,"sad, sad rationalization","I guess preemptive wars are OK after all. Never mind, that the author makes his case for Iraq which did NOT have any ties with Al Quaida (and was downright hostile towards it), did NOT possess any WMDs, and committed all those terrible crimes against humanity while it was allied to the US... The sad thing is that it was known before the invasion. At least if you opened your eyes. But the author justifies any attack on any country that MIGHT pose some danger in the far future. (Does the present warmongering against Iran pop in mind?)So far the consensus was that preemptive wars are NEVER justified. Never. To turn this around is very-very dangerous. Look at the most prominent example.After all, those pesky Poles were about to attack Germany, weren't they? Hitler had to protect his people.I hope there is a hell, and these people will contemplate their ways causing suffering and death all over the world while burning there for eternity."
2,safe poetry,"or poetry to be read in a safe. there are some lovely poems here from sherman alexie, david barber, mark levine, and david marlatt, but for the most part, the poems feel stiffly correct -- corpses with perfect posture. this is no-beauty, no-risk stuff."
5,A surprise ending,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book, but a friend of mine had suggested I order it. She had read it and loved it!! The characters were easy to understand and the plot easy to follow, but the best part of it by far is the ending!! I don't want to give anything away, but the ending blew me away and totally makes the book worth reading!!"
1,gossip and old chestnuts as history,"This is an example of "" oriental"" history writing : using old chestnuts and gossip curerent in Tehran's aristocratic circles as history. The issue of the rivalry between the British and Russian empires in Iran, and the threat that they both posed to Iran's very survival as an independent nation-state is left aside in favour of anecdotes and innuendos. The only way to enjoy this book is to forget that its subject is history and to read it as a collection of little tales circulating in the Iranian capital in the forties and fifties. The author, assuming a nationalist pose, repeats, parrot-like, the rumours spread by the British and their agents as part of a strategy to drag the Iranian leadership in mud and thus promote the myth of their own invincibility. A reader in Lodnon"
2,Iran and the Rise of Reza Shah : From Qajar Collapse to,This book is for general public and casual reading. Certainly would not be used at the University level.
2,BE MORE KIND,"Some readers of this book appear too harsh on the author.The book is certainly not the pinnacle of the art of biography. Ghani's prose is hesitant, almost amateurish. The book is also full of factual errors and tedious repetitions.But the subject, a soldier who rose to become the King of Kings of Iran, one of the oldest monarchies in the world, is fascinating enough to compensate for the author's weaknesses.Also, Ghani must be commended for sifting through a mass of British official documents about a critical period in Iranian history. He has been unable to analyze the documents and point out their relevance to events. But the fact that he offers them in good order is no mean achievement.I give Ghani's book two stars if only because he has created new interest in Reza Shah, one of the greatest figures of the 20th century Middle East.Interested Reader"
2,Great for everything but the PSP,"Yeah, this worked great for about 12 hours. Then I was getting the re-insert card error. My PSP reads the card about 40% of the time, and even then I get serious lag when trying to play MP3's and Video. If you have a Sony Camera, probably a great card, but its awful when dealing with the Sony PSP."
5,it works very good,I have used it on my camera sony cybershotT33 and it works just fine. I definitely have no problem with it. And it had a fairly low price at the time I purchased.
3,"The scan disk did not work for the Canon digital camera, however, it may be perfect for a different brand.",SanDisk SDMSPD-512-A10 512 MB MemoryStick Pro DuoThis product did not work at all for the Canon A590IS digital camera.It may work perfectly for a different brand.
5,very good,"I had it for over a year, then I sold it with the camera, I got it for half the price the sony card was.fast, reliable, dependable."
2,Just died on me,"I have owned my memory stick for about a month and a half, and last night it just stopped being recognizable by either my psp or my card reader. I thought that perhaps I had done something to it somehow, but after researching about the card and reading the reviews here I realize that I just got a bad card.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because when it was working, it worked perfectly. However, now I have a tiny peice of plasstic that I paid 80 dollars for.I would absolutely NOT reccommend this card."
4,lots of space,This memory stick allows me to take and store a lot of pictures and movies. OR I can take one really long movie. I also have the 256MB memory stick. I will have to get the 1GB memory stick also.
1,Circuit City is the worst store.,I ordered this on November 25 for $35 on Amazon from Circuit City store. They cancelled my order next day due to their own pricing error. I can't believe they do this to customers. I will report them to Better Business Bureaus.
1,Did not work with Sony Video Camera,"I purchased the momory stick for my Sony DCR-PC350. However, the memory stick has rarely recognized by my Sony handycam. When I use genuine sony memory stick, the camera recognizes it. Therefore there must be something wrong with Sandisk side. Don't buy this product. Go for genuine sony memory stick."
4,Great price - Made in China,"I bought the 512 MB. memory stick as an upgrade for the 16 MB. one which came with my new Sony HDV video camera. This camera can also take 2.8Mpix. digital pictures.The memory stick works fine but there may be some compability issues. Windows XP has no problem recognizing the sony stick when I stick it in the card reader to download my pictures, but it dosn't recognize the sandisk at all.I'm waiting for a reply from Sandisk support to see if there is a driver or something else required."
1,Known error with this memory stick,"I just got off the phone with the technical support for sandisk, and they informed me that my 'reinstert memory stick' error message is a known problem. What's more, they have no solution, and offer nothing in exchange at the moment. They said to 'watch my email for news' about some sort of solution. Unacceptable.I will be returning this product, and buying a certified sony memory stick. At least, with their product support, the chances are more likely that they'll honor their warrantee and replace the card."
5,Engrossing,"An exhaustive book on one of great ""mystery"" of jet fighter history.The aircraft program is fully narrated from the enthusiastic ""go ahead"" to the painfull termination.Direct testimonies of executives,engineers and test pilots make the plot really vivid showing the feelings behind this endeavour:the epilog still looks like the end of a dream. Illustrations,pictures,factory drawings are truly intriguing,since few were previously available.Particularly impressive is the ""log"",where significant figures are released on aircraft data and performances. Finally some light on a cold war aicraft that ""might have been""!"
3,Sad tail of the Avro Arrow,"If you like avation history you know the story of the Avro Arrow and the BAC TSR.2. Both aircraft laid to rest at the point of serial production.This book is a little dry and doesn't cover the subject in any political way, it's very much a book about the Arrow. So if you want a realy 'histroy' of the plane then this is the book for you.I personally enjoyed it and feel I have a decent grasp of the project and the possibilities that this machine offered."
3,No se escuha,"El telefono, luce muy bien, pero el sonido es casi inexistente, yo lo compre para mi niña de 11 meses, y la verdad a ella no le llama la atención en absoluto, se ha caido unas cuantas veces, y no se ha roto."
2,Can't hear it,"The telephone is cute and has several options and colorful buttons, but it speaks very faintly and is basically inaudible. It can barely be heard if you hold it up to your ear.It is a little too large for tiny hands to hold and manipulate. Babies, much less toddlers, can recognize that it is not ""the real McCoy"", and therefore not very interesting."
2,the volume is really bad,its ok for the price but what good is it? if you can't hear it!!the volume really sucks!!!!
5,Very nice gift!,"I bought these for my parents and they love them, they don't have to worry about using a coaster and they are dishwasher safe."
2,A disappointment,"Aveni had a great opportunity, and he blew it with inconsistent delivery and narcissistic self-reference. This might be a fine book if entitled ""A Professor Ruminates on Holidays"". However, huge digressions into his personal experiences of solstice ceremonies in Latin America, for example, spoil the narrative rhythm and the scholarly tone.I expected a soundly researched chronological history of major seasonal holidays, with their sources, evolution, and traditions clearly articulated. If you want that too, don't buy the book.Instead, this is an interesting series of essays, with too-poor documentation, that pique the reader's interest in holidays but leaves him unsatisfied."
1,Broke at first use Avoid...!!!,"Bought a similar 10x50 called ""Porros"" it was on Sale for $19.99 ( MSRP $79) at Big 5 Sporting Goods in Anaheim.The eye pieces are attached by a flimsy loose center screw that has the words ""10x50"" on it. A small twists of that single screw and the whole back-end pair of eye piece disintegrates and falls on the floor.Talk about cheap quality! A definite return for refund on this one...My ""It Sucks"" rating is -100 !"
5,A Must Have Item for any Al Jolson Fan,"I was so pleased to receive this item as a gift for Fathers Day. This 3CD Deluxe Edition contains many of the songs I have listened to from The Jolson Story and Jolson Sings Again, but are in there original presentations free from the Movie makers arrangements to compliment the story line. It was so refreshing to hear such a crisp and clear delivery from the Legendary Al Jolson accompanied with outstanding instrumentals. Many of Al's early works are included in this set, but with outstanding clarity. I have heard some of his early deliveries and the sound quality wasn't very good when reproduced on a CD. I was very impressed with all of the sound reproductions included in this outstanding 3CD set. If you are an Al Jolson Fan, you will certainly do yourself a huge disservice if you do not purchase this item. It is the best set of Al Jolson recordings that I have ever heard."
2,Jolson fan,Al Jolson was a phenomenal success as an entertainer during the vaudville years and in early films (app 1915-1935). He had a voice and style that was youthful and energetic. This was the hallmark of the great Al Jolson. You get very little of that Jolson in this boxed set. Most of the songs (47 in this set of 60) were from recordings made in the late '40's after his film biographies. The voice is an octave lower than the original Jolson voice and the style is a bit tired. Add a third star if you like the songs. But if you want to hear the style and voice that made Jolson great you'll find very little of it in this set.
4,Good overview,"""Golden Years of Al Jolson"" presents the listener with a good overview of the work of the great Al Jolson.The sound quality of these CDs is first-rate.Many of these tracks don't appear to be the original hits but they are very well done and a real pleasure to listen to.Jolie even teams up with Bing Crosby for a couple of tunes!"
3,What you would expect for the price,"I bought this ring for my granddaughter. The description was very vague. I now know why. The size is not adjustable, but no size was requested when I ordered it. The ring does change colors, but did not come with a chart to let you know what the colors mean. All in all, it is what you would expect for the price. But, after I bought it, I found one at a convenience store for $1.99 that was just as good."
3,"Fun, inexpensive mood ring","I bought this ring for my son, and it's about what you'd expect for the price--just a fun, inexpensive mood ring. I do wish the size (adult) had been mentioned in the review. It's way too big for a child."
1,Suuuuuuuuuuuuks,The plastic brakes after a week so don't get it it's not worth your money no wonder its cheap # lame
2,this is a rip of,i expeted this thing to acually work and be some fun for my daughter but it didnt even change colers. Then i found one that acually worked at a fair for $1.89
1,Not worth it.,"You would think a clock/ tide clock would be a simple thing to use, especially since there weren't any instructions included. So, I set them. The time clock works perfectly. The tide clock doesn't. I checked on the internet to see if there was some special way you need to set the tide clock, then followed the directions. Still doesn't keep proper tide time. Worthless piece of crap."
4,The Savoy Sultans,"The Savoy Ballroom was the not only the Home of Happy Feet but was also the scene of many ""Battles of Bands"". The Savoy Sultans, a smallish group led by reedman Al Cooper, was a frequent and formidable participant in these events and often ""cut"" bands of considerably wider reputation.Although the band was a small one, consisting two trumpets, three reeds and three or four rhythm, it was a powerful group. Sublety was not its forte, swing was! There were no complicated arrangements, most being head arrangements allowing plenty of solo space. The band was admired by dancers and musicians alike.This CD includes all the Decca recordings by the Sultans except for four tracks recorded later in 1941 which have been issued in a sampler. Unfortunately, there is a bit of distortion in this recording or in the transfer to CD, noticeable in some of the trumpet solos, but it's not enough to discourage anyone who wants to enjoy the output of this fine little band."
5,A easy read with great tips,"Harrington and Shapiro have written a book that is actually fun to read. Not many books of this nature are full of humor and good solid advice. It reminds me of having the friends you use as tech support bound into a book. Each chapter is full of short, quick tips and techiques for the beginner and the seasoned professional. It is a must for those editors that are migrating from other NLE or are considering dipping their toes in the FCP world for the first time."
2,Unispiring Series of Books that Just Doesn't Make You Want to Learn,"I purchased this used for a buck. It's of course, for an older version of the program that is Final Cut Pro, now in version 6. From the Black and White cover to the dull interior, It's not even worth keeping around for reference sake."
3,Not for beginners,"Indeed this book gives tons of small tips and I saw many tricks. It is fun, fast and easy to read. However, this book is a list of tricks in alphabetical order and it does not help me to learn how to use Final Cut Pro. I'm at the beginner stage and this book is not appropriate for my needs. When I will be able to use the program, I may come back to this book.Laurent - Switzerland"
3,An enjoyable book,I found out about this book because I had read this author before and I thought it would be good to read as I had done king Arthur at school and I really like history. I highly recommend this book.
5,Perfect,"My girlfriend wanted a cheep anklet that she could use any time, that was stylish and she didn't have to worry about it breaking. This got the job done perfectly, couldn't ask for anything better for this price"
1,fake,there is nothing real about this anklet. i bought it under the understanding it was real 14k gold i knew the diamonds would not be i did expect it to look so cheaply made looks like something you could get at walmart for a few bucks i am very disapointed i tired to email the seller and never heard back
5,The Perfect Blend,"When I first heard this song I was HOOKED BIG TIME!! If you can remain calm and not move to the infectious beat, there's something wrong with you!! The driving bass undercurrent is smokin' hot!! Very few recordings get 5 FULL STARS, but this one does!! Do yourself a favor and buy it!!"
4,Melody Rocks!,We (my friends and I) listen to Melody at Spanish class in school. We always look forward to hearing Melody while we work on our assighnments! Melody has and exceptional singing gift for her age! SHE IS ONLY 12! I suggest the CD to everyone! GO MELODY!
5,REALLY FUNNY.,"THIS LITTLE LADY IS NOW A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. SINCE THIS CD WAS ON THE TOP IN ALL LATIN AMERICA AND SPAIN,IT WAS HEARD AND IT IS HEARD STILL IN YOUTH AND FAMILY PARTIES. IT HAS SONGS FULL OF RYTHM,WITH HAPPY AND FUNNY LYRICS. I BOUGHT THIS one SPECIALLY FOR MY KID'S BIRTHDAY"
1,A Music Professional from Spain,"Pretty young Dominican girl, it seems she won some contest so she decided to release a few albums ""De Pata Negra"", ""T.Q.M."" and ""Muevete"". It is unfortunate that she has neither the talent nor the voice to go very far. She certainly will never make it in Latino (or Spanish music), kind of funny because she tries to sing in Castellano in a few of her songs. Very few latino artists have succeeded in crossing over from Latino music to Spanish music and those who did succeed were already superstars like Shakira, Thalia, JLo and Ricardo Arjona. Perhaps she should try singing pop music in English where neither talent nor a voice is required, she could make it on her looks alone. Her sound tracks are quite good, if her band found another singer they could probably go far. I will give one star for her band."
1,DON'T DO IT!,In order for this Windows 95 disc to work on an XP computer you need to contact Scholastic and have them email a patch. You then download the patch to the computer on which you would load the disc. Limits portability dramatically. Just buy a new one!
5,great story,I had already read this once before but lost the book so I bought this to replace. One of the best stories on war from an unlikely hero doing his duty along the lines of Seargant York. Also check out the movie by the same name starring Rock Hudson.
2,Mx440 AGP video from JATON,"Generally a disappointing product - was purchased to replace the original nVidia Vanta card in a Gateway Pentium III 550 MHz desktop. The pros were that the card is relatively inexpensive, and installed easily. The cons are that while this card is advertised as a solution for serious gamers, which I am not, it has trouble with basic graphics in older games such as Doom II, Myst, and Riven; also problems rendering basic GIF and JPG images in Internet Explorer and ACDSee. Users serious about graphics and games should consider other products."
1,Haggard Recordings,A great collection of songs. A miserable collection of recordings. It sounds as if they were all recorded over two days when the Hag had a cold. Not the original recordings. It hurts to listen to these versions.
2,1 year warranty not long enough,"My camera has ceased functioning after 18 months. I called SVAT and no help, sorry, out of warranty. Planned obsolescence? I will try another product."
1,A waste of money,"The video had to have been made 30 - 40 years ago. After viewing the video we have changed our mind & we are not going to take the Cascade Loop. I know the state of WA is beautiful, but that wasn't depicted. Don't waste your money."
4,"A Good Read, and He Doesn't Hold Back...","This book by the All-American Boy seemed pretty honest. Garvey tells of how hurt he felt to be shunned by teammates who were resentful of his ""Perfect"" image and his fondness for the cameras. He does understand why they would feel that way. There's some pretty good stuff about his conflicts with Don Sutton, too.While Garvey does reference cheating on his ex-wife Cyndy, he barely tips the iceberg of all the ladies he loved and left in the '80s, which finally culminated in an ugly scandal near the end of the decade. This book was published too early. Fortunately for Garvey, the Wade Boggs/Margo Adams and Pete Rose's gambling sagas grabbed most of the headlines, and the Garvey dirt pretty much went away.I think with the numbers he put up, and taking into account all the fine teams he played for, Steve Garvey is a borderline Hall-of-Fame candidate who will likely gain admission in the distant future with players like Dave Concepcion, Dave, Parker, and Al Oliver."
5,Like you ...,"I find Steve Garvey to be the world's record holder for integrity, good looks and responsibility. He is, after all Steve Garvey. Who can forget the 74 MVP or all the Gold Gloves? Who can forget his fourth inning foul out to the first baseman in that meaningless April 1978 game in Montreal? I'll cherish the fact that Steve is a role model who'll never let us down. Because with Steve it's all about integrity, being true to yourself, living within one's means and holding your word as a sacred bond. It's refreshing that an athlete who's clearly superior to most people in all facets of existence, can talk to us on ""our"" level and make us believe in the power of dreams and realize that we may never live the integrity-filled, morally responsibily life he has, but we all have to aspire to something better than what we are -- or we'll end up just being us. Thank you, Steve."
3,"Hmmmm, nothing special here...","This book is not bad by any means, but it is not truly good either. It just lacked that special something that makes a truly good book. I did like the character of Inza thought, and wouldn't mind seeing her in the future. One thing that I did not like, however, was some aspects of the way the autors portraied Lord Soth. At times he seemed downright stupid, every one around him seemed to kind of know what was going on while he was the one in the dark (ha ha). All in all not a bad book."
2,It could've been better.,"Disappointing. Soth barely appears, everybody fools him, and he does nothing interesting or new. Anyway, there are some good characters and subplots. Predictable."
5,Lord Soth Rules,"I think tha lord soth should have his own movie or game, something that will give us more storyline."
1,HUGE FLOP,"Spectre of the Black Rose is the follow up book to Knight of the Black Rose. Lowder returns in a dubious paring with Voronica Whitney-Robinson. I am uncertain what makes this book so bad. The story has such promise and yet falls so short of the mark that it is almost sickening.This complete tragedy of a novel might have been good if the authors would have focused on Soth. The reader comes away from the book feeling like nothing was accomplished. The best character in the novel barely works. The Bloody Cobbler who is victimized by a stupid name but has the best lines in the entire novel, struggles to save this book from being a total waste of paper. He fails. In short, the best part of this novel is the beautiful binding and cover art. This is definitely one book that you cannot judge by the cover."
5,"An excellent book, good for fans of Ravenloft & Dragonlance.","The book was well writen, and the subplots keep you on edge to the last page. I've been a follower of both Ravenloft & Dragonlance novels for a long time. SoTBR brings the two together in a way that fans of both will enjoy it. SoTBR has many intersting subplots that will keep you guessing at what happened to the end. I really loved it and think you will too. Nothing I can say can give it the credit It deserves!"
3,Was a great read but Soth was a bit too cheesy,"Ok, I've been an avid Dragonlance/Ravenloft fan for years and of course Lord Soth has always wetted my appetite for the undead. Theres only one problem with this book, Lord Soth is a blundering sot with little guile and trusting as a lamb it seems. When I think of Lord Soth I think of smoldering resentments, twisted honor, and of course his very cool magic. Besides Soth being a tad on the lightweight side the plot and the climax of this book left me in awe. I was impressed with the theme and well thought out story telling. I recommend this book to all Ravenloft fans."
4,A good transition,It was a good continuation of Soth's story.Would have liked a bit more focus on his internal struggle.But overall a good read.
5,Amazing,"2nd part of Lord Loren Soth of Dargaard Keep Story. Knight of Solamnia, antagonist of the great conjunction. Very nice story"
4,"A real page turner but, predictable if you know Soth's story","This is a very good book and if you like Lord Soth as much as I do then I suggest picking it up. Soth is being attacked from all sides at once by foes from the present, past, and the unexpected. The best thing I can say is that the Shadow Cataclysm is what it should take to get a Darklord like Soth out of Ravenloft!"
4,"Difficult to follow, great as a whole.","If you aren't into the character of Lord Soth or into the DragonLance world, this book is not for you. Taken by itself this book is a slow read and terribly involved. When taken as a whole of the DragonLance world, it is almost required reading. You can see Lord Soth going from being a virtual prisoner to the demiplane of Ravenloft to regaining his sanity and attempting to be the first Darklord to escape back to his home land."
2,A book to judge by the title,"After having read the previous novel, Knight of the Black Rose, this was really disappointing. Nothing describes this book better than the title. Lord Soth (the black rose in the title) really is a ""spectre"" in this book, his role in the novel is so small he's almost a minor character. Large sections of this book focus exclusively on new characters that are neither interesting nor believable. It's a shame that instead of developing a novel that revolves around an interesting character, like Lord Soth, the authors instead chose to write a novel where he's stuck in the background."
2,Ok book,The Book without Words was an ok book but Avi has written mauch better ones. It had alot of description but it was hard to follow.
3,It's DA BOMB....well at least for a few weeks,"I am a casual fan of Bomberman and this is the first Bomberman I own and I must say that the game is sweet fun...for a while. The gameplay does get repeative and although they added a variety of different game play objectives it still just boiled down to the same thing...bomb for me, bomb for you, bomb for everyone. The graphics are sweet and the Anime intro is MAD, just MAD, I could watch it over and over again. The gameplay as I said is standard and repeatitive although the Aqua fights rule!!!If you are a Bomberman fanatic then by all means get it you won't be disappointed."
2,Mixed feelings,"I must admit to enjoying this book when I read it 15 or so years ago. It's a fairly good fantasy. However, like another reviewer here, I was bothered by the obvious propaganda intent of the book. Also, there are parts of it that are simply ludicrous, such as the fact that some of the ""teachers"" would have been something like 130 years old (possible but rather suspect), as well as some simple falsehoods about Gurdjieff's activities. There is much unknown about what the man really did, but enough is clear to discount most or all of what is in this book. I have enjoyed many of Shah's books through the years, but this one caused me to lose a great deal of respect for him. Bennett's book ""Witness"" describes the early emergence of Shah on the British scene and his activities to woo students of the Fourth Way."
2,It is a Real Effort to read Rafael Lefort,"This book claims finding Gurdjieff's teaching in the Walled Garden of Truth. This is not based on a serious study of Gurdjieff, but on something else. However, the book has value as entertainment and can be read as a substitute for the Mullah Nasr Eddin stories, although it lacks much of the humour.Many claims have been made to the origins of Gurdjieff's teaching and traces of it can be also found in many, also in Sufism.The book came out in 1966 and one could suspect that the 'teachers of Gurdjieff' had already died by 1966 (before he died himself in 1949). Unless... the writer had some means of communicating with the dead, which indeed could be a 'Real Effort'...."
3,Really not such an effort,"For some reason this book put me in mind of James Cowan's ""A Mapmaker's Dream."" I enjoyed it enormously. Like Cowan's book, it is a fascinating fable. I'm not particularly troubled over the question of how much of it is ""true."" I wasn't particularly looking for any great revelations and so I was not disappointed not to find any. Nonetheless, there is a lot of wisdom here.Did the author ""make it all up?""--whatever that might mean. I often find myself asking myself the same question about Gurdjieff. My own view is that Gurdjieff was a highly realized being, but that the trail went cold on his passing. According to the author of this book, his last words to his disciples were, ""What a fine mess I've left you in."" Indeed."
2,a little Distasteful of shah,"I really like indres shah i read most of his work. but this book Well i know what shaw was trying to do. of course to take down the cult of personality around gurdijeff which i wholeheartedly agree with, and also to show the folly of the seeker but i felt this was done in a s dis-tasteful and insulting way as well as mean sprited it could have executed better is all. was it a expose on the phycology of the seeker? a axe grinding expose? i dont know you decide"
1,Dishonest,"Written by Omar Shah, Idris Shah's brother, this book has nothing to do with Gurdjieff. The intention was to ""collect"" lost sheep after J.G. Bennett gave Coombe Springs to Idris Shah. So the basic message of this book is: Gurdjieff is dead, long lives sufism. Which basically is a kind of advertisement. The question arising: Advertising for what? Who is in need for advertisment? Or is this spiritual competition? Some claim, that Gurdjieff was a member of a certain sufi order, and this sufi order is now represented by I. Shah. This is nonsense. And it throws a strange shadow onto whoever is in need to spread rumors of this kind.The title of this book is a lie. Kind of conning instead of cunning."
1,Where Are The Women?,"No women anywhere, but loads of anti-west propaganda, laced with anti-secularist, anti-science, authoritarian blather. It's the usual misleading Idries Shah take on Sufism (he's the real author). Don't bother with it. Read something substantial instead, like maybe Henry Corbin or Seyyed Hossein Nasr or William Chittick . This isn't Sufism or Islam or spirituality. It's not a real effort."
3,Worth every penny of the price.,"I am an experienced administrator and I found this book sorely lacking for the exam prep. I will admit that it is very acurate, but not very complete. I would not rely on this as a sole source for exam preparation. I ended up using quite a bit of other material to fill in the holes left by this book.I'm holding on to my copy and still consider it money well spent. The concise nature of the book does make it a good quick refrence guide to keep in the office."
2,It's a good outline,This book provides good study outline and a strategy for tracking your progress but it's not detailed enough to be a primary study resource. I wouldn't buy it again.
3,Holey Book!,"A good reviewer book...but certainly lacks in a few areas that the exam tests you on. And areas you would need when working with a server/network! Like Pulse or Replication Governors! There is no mention of it in the book, but it is important in a network admin's world, as well as the exam--I about saw it everytime I took a transcender and the exam! What about the AT command? Be sure to know about these things, because they show up! Also, another missing part is how to configure Network Monitor inclusion lines! Very important (at least to me and others I know) in monitoring my network...! In all fairness...I think it is a very good review book for the exam, but should not be your only source. Use other books, use trancenders, check your answers, and definitely have HANDS ON knowledge..."
1,ABSOLUTE PYLE OF CRAP,"BUYER BEWAREABSOLUTE PYLE OF CRAPDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTTHIS INEXPENSIVE SUBWOOFER WAS A WEAK PERFORMER TO BEGIN WITH, BUT AFTER ONLY 35 DAYS IT NOW JUST THUMPS WHEN ENERGIZED$ 20 BUCKS TO SEND IT BACK TO MEET IT'S MAKER IN BROOKLYN - FOGET ABOUT IT, BUBBYTHE OTHER REVIEWERS WERE SPOT ON IN STATING THAT THE DEVICE WOULD STOP WORKING AFTER JUST A FEW WEEKS - I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THEIR ADVICE AND PURCHASED A HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT FOR A FEW DOLLARS MOREI SEE THAT ALL OF THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THIS PRODUCT HAD SOMEHOW DISAPPEARED WHEN I CHECKED AMAZON TONIGHTI'll JUST BUY ANOTHER AMP AND GUT THE UNIT RATHER THAN TAKE A TOTAL LOSS ON THIS ILL ADVISED PURCHASE"
2,I am not really super calm!,Did it work?! Not sure....but forced me to rest and listen for a while which is not bad for a start
1,Very irritating voice,"I tried every day for over a week to listen to this CD. I rarely got through the session without ""popping out"" because of something he said in his nasal tone of voice, or, worse, because of his occasional lapse into bad grammar.I have several relaxation CDs that I love. I won't be going back to this one."
3,It was just OK.,"When I read all the five star reviews, I knew I had to have this CD. But when I tried it out, I was a little disappointed. It did help me relax, so it does work. But I wasn't able to reach the same deep levels of peace and relaxation that I had gotten from another CD progam--The FAST Technique for Stress Reliefby Dr. Ronald Nathan. (EXTREMELY relaxing and calming CDs by the way!)Even though Creating Inner Peace and Calm wasn't as helpful as I had hoped, I will probably give it another try. I mean, it did have an effect. Maybe the results improve the more you use it."
3,No CD with the book!,"Although I was pleased with the images included in this edition of Beth's second ephemera book, the product description is unclear when mentioning a ""companion CD"" to this product. Be aware that the CD does NOT come with the purchase price but can be ordered separately for an additional cost of $19.99."
2,"MISLEADING: NO ""COMPANION CD""","Why put ""has a companion CD to go with it"" in the description when it doesn't come with one?"
2,Doesn't measure up,Just returned from France and tasted Black Truffle Butter there and the d'Artagnan brand just didn't have the same flavor and richness I found in my travel through France.
4,super-classic!,"here is another allen masterpiece with a lot of sallinger influence. A MUST for everyone, the movie was great too!"
4,My Grandson loves this book!,I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who is about to become a big brother and who loves to wake his parents on Sunday Mornings. He absolutely loved this book despite the fact that it was written about 40 years ago and doesn't have transformers or robots in it. I have always loved Judith Viorst's writing and it is a joy to pass it along to the next generation.
4,Judith Viorist children's book,"This is a book I read to my son when he was small and he is now in his 30's! I recently purchased it for our grandson who is 2. It is fun to add your own comments as you review the pictures with your little one. A very funny story. The downside is some of the language which I really had forgotton about. The father in the story tells his children they are going to be spanked if they don't behave. In this day and age, I am not sure if all children know about spankings. Times have changed. Several times the little boy uses the word, God, but does mention he should not say that word when he first says it. Our feeling is we would rather not go down that path and say that word when used out of context and not referring to the Bible. I just think it is important to mention this to reviewers. I am not sorry I bought the book. Just feel the need to change it up."
5,Priceless piece of art,"This is one of the greatest music DVD's ever. Not only does it have the entire Isle of Wight performance by the Miles Davis Septet(August 29,1970) and interviews surrounding the event, it has clips of other performances by Miles and extremely rare footage of the greatest band in the history of jazz(Miles Davis Quintet 1964-1968) performing on the Steve Allen Show in 1964. Thank you Murray Lerner for all that coverage of the Isle of Wight festival, thank you Columbia Records for all the Miles Davis boxsets and especially thank you Miles! You are my idol. Rest in peaceMiles Davis1926-1991"
3,miles Electric A Different Kind of Blue,"As I mentioned above, this DVD was more appreciative, the arrangements and style to me was much better, the music was one that I could digest a little more. This is the first time I have ever purchase a Mile Davis record ,even though I have heard so much of him and little bits of his recordings over he airways."
5,Simply amazing!,"Just bought this DVD and I saw it from start to finish in awe. Very insightful interviews with Hancock and Santana as well. The era of where Miles went against the status quo and forged his own brand of new progressive music. Miles took jazz away from the ""snobs"" and made it hip even for the Woodstock generation. To this day this music is still amazing and definitely rocks!I never get tired of watching this DVD, everytime I get something different from it- that is true art. If you are a fan of Miles Davis' electric period or just a music lover that is open minded, this DVD is worth every penny."
3,Fantasy Book or not ??,"This book is very nice, but fo not buy it when you are looking for a book which takes a look inside these beautiful houses. It only shows the outside and ,i think, too many pictures of the gardens. It is really a nice book but i thought there would be many pictures of the houses and not so many detailed pictures of gardens..."
3,Officer Friendly,"This movie was shot in Kokomo In. I was a member of the Kokomo Police Department during its shooting, and was in the movie. My birthday present was Chuck Conners line ""Sitzes...get the girl"". Wish I looked like that now. The story line is ok. Hated it when the chief of police (Chuck Conners) ran over a pedestrian during the high speed chase and kept going. Worst part was when the terrorist chased a large bus the whole movie but was switched for a ""Short Bus"" in the ending...Cheezy"
3,Tubing,"My DH got me the Grace EZ3 quilting frame for Christmas. Today I tried to attach fabric (leader) with the tubing to no avail. So I worked it without fabric. After 45 minutes, broken nails, skinned fingers, tears, and many choice words I got the tubing in and not sure I ever want to take it out again. Will it always be this difficult? If so I don't think this frame is going to work for me.The product came with all the pieces and parts and DH got it together in a timely manner.In all fairness I can't really rate the product. I am waiting for an email back from the Grace company about the too tight tubing. Until then I am unable to use the frame. There has to be a trick they didn't mention in the manual, to make it work more easily."
4,Good from many angles,"I bought the videocassette, which was on sale, many years ago. In this standup comedy competition, 3 aspiring comedians compete, their sets interspersed with jokes from young Jay Leno's routine. It is interesting to compare the brazen Jay Leno of yesteryear with his polished routines of today. Check out the winner's biography on Wikipedia to see how he has made his way in show business over the years. I've been looking for the DVD for quite some time, and was very happy to see it finally available."
4,Angela's Garden Hat,"Angela's Garden Hat looks very cute, durable and practical. Bought it for our granddaughter's 3rd birthday this summer- hopefully it fits and she'll wear while gardening. ;)"
3,Looks like its gonna last a long long time,Durable construction hat that seems to withstand abuses from kids... Colors are really bright and cheerful... Charming to look at.
5,Back in Print!,Mine is the same old story about the lost LP that then went out of print..Been waiting for this re-release for about a year. Nothing to fault here: Carmichael's songs are wonderful his relaxed singing style is perfectly complemented by exquisite arrangements and....Art Pepper!
2,Buyers Beware,"These are the same songs from Totally Buble.From review of Totally BubleAlthough this CD is Michael Buble who does have a great voice, and shows to be a big star some day, he DID NOT wish to have this CD released! This is what he had to say about it himself:""Totally Buble"" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called ""Totally Blonde"" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album."" - Michael Buble"
1,Buyers Beware,"These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent.""Totally Buble"" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called ""Totally Blonde"" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album."" - Michael Buble"
4,good reading,Very well written book. It is precise with details about history of Noyce's life and Silicon Valley growth. An interesting book for technology history lovers.
3,Slanted and Incomplete,"I've spent 30 plus years in this and related industries. As a partial introduction to IC's and their ""market successful"" agents, it is OK. As entertainment it is good, just don't forget you are being entertained! As a biography of Noyce it is only partial. That the rest of the story with Jack Kilby, Texas Instuments, and non-Noyce IC industry and players is missing makes it very bad history. That the patent fight history and the rules for patents, mainly that continuous work on ideas must be shown or it's ""abandoned"", are not covered makes it very much a dis-eduational offering. The big truth, stated deep in the book, that ""Credit floats up."", almost makes the reading good, but not quite!"
4,The Man Behind the Microchip: Robert Noyce and the Invention of Silicon Valley,Very interesting and in-depth biography of a very important man in our techological lives.
5,Nice,"Awesome soundtrack, anyone who likes instrumental or anyone whom has never seen the show should get this album! Music is music, and this is top notch!"
1,Not DragonballlZ,"The U.S is th eonly country that dubbed over the original voice acting and the music from DBZ. The Japanese version is far and away the best version of DBZ, when gohan is fighting cell, when goku finally kills majin buu that music is the best music, So much lost in the american version the actors SUCKED sound more lik ethye were constipated than powering-up, the series was ruined here. This soundtrack isnt even close to As good as the ""original"" version of Dargonball/Z/Gt"
4,worked fine,"worked fine, it seems to be of the same quality as the one that I have from Harbor Freight that I found the day after I got this one delivered."
1,Don't waste your money,I was not able to get one flare out of this product; the main shaft bend and the 3/16 mandrel broke off on the first attempt; I am always very careful with my tools; I purchased the OTC ISO Bubble flaring tool - works perfect and is recommended.Amazon's return process is awesome.
4,With Flare.....,"I have used flaring tools on plumbing, but never attempted a double flare. Needed this while replacing brake line on vehicle. This kit provided the proper size i needed and others as well. directions were straightforward and easy to understand and finished my brake replacement with ease.I suggest this kit to anyone doing double flares."
2,had to replace the smallest die after one car use,"after doing half the lines for my 72 Chevelle it became apparent that shaft that goes into the line on the smallest die used for the first step in the procedure was too small in diameter allowing the flare to occationally be slightly offset. i went to the local auto-zone and purchased a similar kit for 37 bucks and finished the velle and have now done a truck with that kit. I'll try to get some of my money back by selling this one off, sans the smallest die."
3,needs some redesign & rework to be more useful useful,"the clamp had sharp burrs on the edges which had to be filed off to prevent damaging the tubes. The handle can slide out during use so you have to add some tape to the end of the handle to keep it from sliding out. Overall, the product works but the design is only OK. The key tricks are to carefully clean up the end of tube - sand square and clean the edges. Next, apply some oil to the end before beginning the flaring."
2,It's not quite dead yet.,"I didn't have a whole lot of trouble learning how to use this, and I didn't have any issues with how it formed flairs.I did end up breaking the cone just as I was finishing the last(4th) flair.For the money I'd do it again, but this is a disposable project tool, don't expect it to live in your toolbox forever."
2,hit one click by mistake ..,hit one click by mistake .. so i tried to watch it .. but it's very amateur and very slow movie.. sorry
2,Porcelain Enameled Non-stick Frypan,I purchased this pan about 2 years ago and was happy with it in the beginning.Now the pan is no longer non-stick--everything sticks no matter what I do. I didn't think when I purchased this that it would be a 2 year deal!
2,Flimsy to the point of uselessness.,"One word: flimsy.The whole unit flexes and bounces as you type or move your hands.It rocks back and forth and causes more discomfort in the motion alone than it relieves with its ergonomics.It was also surprisingly time consuming to assemble, even with power tools.In the end I preferred to rest the keyboard on the desk rather than deal with the annoyance."
1,Worst adjustable keyboard drawer/platform.,This thing wobbles uncontrollably. It feels like you're trying to type through an earthquake. I thought maybe I received a bad box w/ a missing part of some sort to stabilize it. The new one I received was exactly the same. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,Horrible!!,This has got to be one of the worst products I've ever bought. It's poorly made and I have NO idea why there is a hole in the middle of the keyboard. I can only assume its to make the keyboard lighter by using less metal. Not worth the cost and shipping is a rip-off.
2,Disappointed,"I feel bad about giving only 2 stars to a man's life's work but I bought this book on the basis of other reviews that referred to it as comprehensive. Unfortunately it is anything but comprehensive. In almost every second or third song Stan comments that he has had to modify or clean up the lyrics (at the publisher's insistence?). I was looking for a definitive reference point for how sea songs were sung by seamen in the age of sail - this book cannot be that if the songs have been sanitised for the sensibilities of another era.Having said the above, it is still a wonderful book, full of information about how to sing shanties etc. but I am just left wondering what the songs real lyrics were."
4,What to say to that?,"Ask any shantyman in the world, what book to get, to get some useful information on sea shantys; he'll tell ya to get Hugills book. You'll find the tunes and lyrics to about 400 shantys in this book. If Hugill found more than one version of one song, you'll find em too in this book. You'll find a song under all the titles it's known under, introduced by historical backgrounds and sometimes storys, on how Hugill himself used the songs. The whole book is introduced by ""the art of the shantyman"" a detailed history of shanty tradition. The only thing, I found improvable is the fact, that sometimes it's a bit difficult to find the version of a song, that one is looking for because there are so many versions.Well, this book's the shantyman's bible indeed!"
2,Boundaries,"Poet and teacher Jeff Mann shares his influences and memories in this collection of essays. Through travel to places such as Scotland and Key West, he connects the foreign to the personal and ruminates on family legacy, gay life and literature, and the trials of being a leather bear. Mann is an accomplished writer, and these essays are well written, but certain points are repeated over and over, creating tedium for the reader. And unfortunately, he doesn't elaborate much, so by the end of the book, the reader is not left with a clear picture of the whole man he has become, but rather is only briefly acquainted with the plethora of identity aspects Mann claims. Despite this, there is still much to enjoy here."
2,$60 Could Have Been Better Spent,"I bought both ""How to Create an Artistic Face Casting"" and ""Casting the Female Torso"" DVD's, and I have buyer's regret.I won't call them a rip-off, but they are overpriced. Each DVD could be condensed to about 4 minutes of information. The rest is fluff.The DVD's do not go beyond basics. How to do a full body cast, for instance, is not hinted at. Or how to cast a round body part, such as an arm.If both DVD's were combined into one and sold for $15, they would be a good deal.As it is, unless you're trying to spend money, you might do better with another video or a library book.I do wonder if the $30-dollar price tag isn't a result of small-press distribution costs and the makers of these videos aren't earnest in their desire to share what they know, but currently the videos are not informational enough to justify the cost.I've now spent $60 on both these videos to learn body casting and I'm really not much further along than I was before the videos."
2,Not quite there,"One would assume that the initial discovery of Tahiti by Europeans would be an exciting and captivating read. Not quite.We do learn of the early skirmishes between the two cultures and the resultant trade practices amongst them (the Tahitians valued iron nails so much so that the ship Dolphin was nearly deplete in this commodity). Queen Purea was so heartbroken and devastated when it was the ship's departure time, she broke down and wept. After five weeks, a bond ensued between both cultures.The author's intent was to restructure journals and records from the shipmates themselves into a supposedly readable account of this historical event. The effort is there, but this book just doesn't sail."
5,A classic,"This game is, in my opinion, the role model for which all GBC games should be. However, with the GBA out now, people are simply ignoring this for Golden Sun. Golden Sun really is something special, but they are missing a lot from passing over this. This game has a compelling storyline, a classical combat system, and lush graphics. You can really tell that Enix really put their heart into improving this game.The combat system is easy to learn. The item system is easy to learn. Nothing in this game is really complex. It's a shame that they had to give it a teen rating, because little kids could understand how to play this game."
5,Best RPG for any Gameboy system yet.,"In Japan the Dragon Quest series (known as Dragon Warrior in the US) has always been huge, every bit as big as Final Fantasy. US audiences haven't taken as strong an intest in this series (I beleive this is at large due to Enix US marketing strategies which have always been much better in Japan), it is still very strong no less. Of the original four Dragon Warrior games released for the 8-bit Nintendo, Dragon Warrior III was by far the best. The Gameboy Color remake is perfect, with enhanced graphics (in a few spots)m haven't finished the game so I'm not sure of all the changes, but so far it just feels like the original (now regarded as a classic game and one of the the most sought after preowned games for NES). If you're a fan of the original top-view Final Fantasy series, you will really enjou this game."
5,A MUST PLAY GAME!!,"This game is one of the best GB games I have ever played. This is also a good game because it is very long(unlike the first one). I have not finished the game yet, BUT IT IS AWSOME. RECOMENDED!"
3,"Nice rug, not quite what I ordered...","The rug is very nice, it is a couple of inchers shorter than advertised and has very little green in it."
1,horrible call,"This call is horrible. I picked one up last fall for squirrel hunting, and was extremely disappointed with it. The sound it makes is nothing like anything I have ever heard in the woods, let alone a squirrel. It scares away more than it could ever attract. If you are looking for an effective squirrel call, this is not the one to get."
1,Waste of money !!,"If you are in need of a resource to study for a Praxis Test....do not buy the books written by ETS. They are a waste of money and provide you with no insight of how to study for these tests. Basically , these books tell you to know everything. I think Barron's puts out the best books to study for Praxis Exams....at least on the elementary level. I got the Barron books for the Praxis.....followed their advice and passed the exam . I do not recommend the books by ETS."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. The information was all stuff I had already read on the ETS website plus a practice test. A very small booklet for a rather large price. I found the best test prep book for this exam was Kaplan's Praxis, it had much more detailed information about the content itself. All in all, this book was good for the pretest and detailed example answers that followed so it isn't a complete waste of money."
4,A bit chincy but works fine,"It is definitely not high end, but fits and works great. Slightly lower amp rating than the OEM so it charges a bit slower but we don't notice since we charge overnight. Well worth the price."
3,Price is right,Great price. Ok for travel or a second charger. The cord is very short and the connection can be flimsy.
1,Huge rip-off (only one collar for this item),"Advertising is VERY misleading for this item. Picture and description make it look like you are getting five collars, but when the item shows up, guess what, one collar for $3.95 plus large shipping fees. Avoid this seller! Much better deals at the local pet store."
1,Thin and Low Quality,This product is thin and of low quality. I'll never buy this product again and I suggest potential buyers to buy other product (quilted ones) AT THE SAME SHIPPED PRICE. Do not be fooled by the picture. They are not the blue ones. Giving the rating one star is too much. It deserves zero star.
1,THESE ARE NOT PUPPY PADS!!!!!!!!,THESE ARE PADS USED ON ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO THE BATHROOM. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE HONEST AND LET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT PUPPY TRAINING PADS. PUPPY TRAINING PADS HAVE A SPECIAL SCENT ON THEM TO ENCOURAGE THE DOG TO USE IT. DON'T BE FOOLED!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!
4,puppy pads,These pads are very nice compared to some I have purchased. I do have a problem with the shipping charges being so high though.
1,Terrible product,Does not work. Does not work. Does not work. Had to use multiple at one time and usually that did not even work for a medium size dog. Terrible waste of money. Sorry I bought. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
3,Nothing Is Definitive,"I'm leery of ""definitive"" books on as changing an artist as Dylan. As with the famous ""other"" Big Black Dylan Book, this is good for killing a bit of time, digging up a few obscure artists and the like. I wouldn't buy this book again, though I might sell it. Not recommended."
2,Less than Inspiring,A collections of writing from top creative coaches with anecdotes. Somehow I found the stories are boring and suggestions didn't inspire me to be creative. Very disappointed.
1,A bunch of letters,"If the result of this book, based on the title was to inspire, It does not!.I found it like a set of letter about creativity, but the organization, the quality of content and the topics where not enogh to inspire something.Of course always we can find something good, but I just found only 2 dossiers that you can see the writter really work for what they get payed."
5,This Splendid Moment (sic),"Rare look into a couple of rare talents. (hey, Bertram we gotcha on video....wherever you are up there!)Just when you can't take anymore of John's beautiful music, Bertram enters and you can die with the sum total of them in this classic look into these two companions in life and in God given talent. Their tribute to Irving Berlin sneaked into this thoughtful production is a touching eulogy the director saw fit to include in this visual, musical, tender production that won't let up. One complaint. I like halvah but my God two carloads?!John McCullough"
4,Redbird,"A fairly good book, Sharon Creech has really shown that she can write a good book. I would read this book again."
4,Fun,I loved the book and you will like it too. It's a great learning book for early starters.~ MicheleKeep loving books!
1,"Great book, but not the book I expected","Chasing Redbird is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. I ordered it for a school project and specifically needed the cover art that is advertised in the picture; however, upon receiving my purchase I was sent a totally different addition than the one advertised in the picture. I really wish that this book had been advertised with the correct cover art so I would have known before I spent my money on something I was not going to get."
5,Chasing Redbird has both adventure and suspense in it.,Chasing Redbird is about a quiet child named Zinny who has a very big family. Nobody pays attention to her except her aunt and a teenage boy named Jake who will steal things to impress her. Zinny then finds a trail and is bound and determined to uncover it by the end of the summer. When she starts camping up there she encounters many strange things.
5,An Excellent Book!!,"If you liked Walk Two Moons than you'll love this book! It's about a girl named Zinnia Taylor who is trying to untangle all the of her memories of people like her Aunt Jessie who died like twisted spaghetti. She feels no one pays attention to her and she is only known as ""one of the Taylors."" She feels guilty for lots of things including the stolen gifts she recieves and is sick of her family and all of her many siblings, like May, who thinks the whole world revolves around her. When she goes exploring through a trail in her yard she learns things about her past she never knew!"
2,Forced to Read Sharon Chreech's Novel!,"I rate this book with boys in mind. This book is quite pointless and boring.It's meant to help kids understand how hard growing up can be, but she does an awful job.Sharon Creech, the author of Chasing Redbird, makes books mostly for females. Sentimental people will find this book great but for the not-so-touchable you'll find it boring and repetitive.If you like books with death and love and all that cheesy stuff you'll like this non-creative, day-by-day story! The thrills in this story are when someone is sick. The pathetic idea of this story may interest the heart-warming readers.Many loving characters are in this simple story. Possibly too much love. The story is set on a farm in Kentucky, which is a nice setting. Death comes too often repeating itself. First goes one family member. Whoosh! There goes another and another. In my opinion this book would rate a 2 star because of the repetitive, non-creative, uncomfortable, pointless story. It's in the dumps!"
5,An exciting and fun book,This was an exciting book and once I picked it up I couldn't put it down!! It starts out slow but when you get into it you never want to stop reading!! This is a great book!!!!
5,Excellent Book!!,This book is great for all ages. You feel as you are with Zinny Taylor throughout the whole book. You relate to her feelings and to her adventure. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
5,An amazing book by Sharon Creech!,"This book was an awesome book. It was about a girl named Zinnia (Zinny for short). Zinny is kind of lost in her big family with her three sisters, her three brothers, her parents, and her aunt and uncle. When a tragic incident happens with her Aunt Jessie, she is beside herself with grief, and is convinced that what happened was her fault. One day, she is walking behind her house, and sees an overgrown trail, and decides to uncover the whole thing, from her little town all the way to Chocton. It turns out to be a very long way, and constantly along the trail, she finds things that relate to what is happening in her life at the moment. The end is very satisfying, and I am convinced that anyone (girls especially) from the ages of 10 to probably 14 or so will really enjoy this thought-provoking novel."
4,so wonderful while so sad,i cried at the end and it was emotional and moving. when her sister was dead and zinnia tells about the drawer stuff i was so sad and all. poor thing and aaunt jesse and all it is to sad!
5,"I read it once, but once is not enough!","Zinny a child of 6 kids, clears a path of which answeres all her questions, like: Does Jake Boone actually have feelings for her, is Uncle Nate really seeing his dead wife, and daughter, and more! I love Sharon Creech's style of writing, and I defidently plan to read this novel again, and again.I reccomend this wonderful book to anyone who is seeking to find their inner-self, or anyone who has read the also wonderful,""Walk Two Moons""."
5,A beautifully crafted novel.,"I love this book so much I've read it three times. I love Sharon Creech's unique style of writing. The main character, Zinnia, has a very mature and yet charming view of the world. She perceives this with a lot of clarity, and yet still there was something that made me laugh on every page. A great read."
3,"Quite good, but not one of her best.","I thouht this book was a brilliant idea- i loved the idea of clearing a trail, and looking back on her past as she (Zinny) did so. But all the way i was waiting for a kind of climax, or something, like there was in 'Walk two Moons' (one of my favourite books). I didn't find the end very satisfying."
2,Sharon Creech's Worst Book,"This is definitely not Sharon Creech's best work. The plot jumps around alot, and takes some really big leaps into fantasy land. This girls parents actually let her spend weeks camping in unknown countryside, by herself, without ANY adult supervision at all, Just because she feels she NEEDS to. Would your parents let YOU do this? Talk about ""Oh my god I have a hangnail, so now I have to climb Everest."" I am normally a big fan of Sharon Creech's Books, but this one kept getting worse. I liked the story about Rose (her cousin) and Aunt Jessie, but she elaborated on it so much that, by the end of the book, it had cycled down into something completely unreal. This book also lacked Sharon Creech's usual humourous touches. O.k., her siblings, Ha HA, but really they just don't cut it. For anyone who is contemplating buying this book, don't. Go out and get Walk Two Moons or Absolutely Normal Chaos, buy something good for a change."
1,A CHILDS REVIEW,"This was a horrible book. It is about a girl who is trying to find herself so she clears miles of trail in her backyard for months at a time with out parental supervision. So its like , "" mom my cat died so I have to climb Mount Everest to find myself.""Ok?"".This is a really boring book. The story is cheesy and sentimental. If you like that stuff then you would like this book. If you dont you would find this book boring and long. It was a book that should have been written as a short story."
4,A great coming of age story,"Sharon Creech in Chasing Redbird captured perfectly a coming of age story of a thirteen year-old girl. Zinny Taylor, one of seven children always feels lost in the jumble of her family and wants peaceful solitude. Always asked by others which Taylor she is, she wants to become an individual and known as Zinny Taylor. Her chance comes when she comes upon a mysterious trail that begins near her family's house. She then decides that she will uncover the whole trail, 20 miles, alone so she can spend time away from all the chaos of her house and find herself. Not only does she find herself, but she uncovers secrets about her family including the death of her cousin, Rose, and her Aunt Jessie. Zinny also discovers love and that she is just as lovable as others. At the end Zinny discovers much about her life as she chases the Redbird."
4,Zinny Taylor: Famous Explorer,"This was my fovorite book of Sharon Creech's novels.Chasing Redbird is a book about a girl named Zinnia Taylor .Also Known as Zinny, as she trys to find her place in the world.She is a therteen year old in a mass of brothers and sisters, In Bybanks,Kuntucky. When she stumbles across a trail that she can call her own.She finds that this will take the hole summer to clear this path.Followed by a boy named Jake and he will do anything for Zinny, even steal.This story is an example of love,death,freindship,and family. I would recomend this book to a young reader looking for adventure,love, and family all in a good book.My favorite part of the book is when Jake steals all the thigs to impress Zinny."
5,My Favorite,"I really liked this book. The whole thing was fabulous. The realism, how it goes from past to present, how anyone can relate to it, the distict personalities, and especially the main characters. Everyone who reads this book is sure to enjoy. Zinny is the main character she finds a trail and through the story remembers things and finds out something she'been wondering about for a long time. She is a quiet girl who doesn't get reconized until she finds a trail which makes her feel special. The clears the trail and people from all around come to seethe beautifull zinnias along the trail."
2,for older children,I read this book because my son was assigned it for summer reading. It was o.k. Not great as so many people have been writing. The plot is dark. On page 4 her cousin dies. On page 8 here Aunt dies. And at some point she tries to suffocate her Uncle. ?????? And then family allows her to hike this trail alone. I think for High School and above this book would be o.k. But with so many other books out there I would not waste your time on this one.
5,Sharon Creech can write great books.,Once again I feel every word she has in this marvelous novel. She has great work and vocabulary. Needs a sequel.
4,It was a okay book,I think that it is a good school book but a little dull. It is a good book if you like a little bit of romance and adventure mixed together.
5,Marvelous Book!Read it to believe it!,"This is a marvelous book.I enjoyed reading every single page.I do not reget spending my time reading this excellent book.Sharon Creech does know how to write books.I've read ""Walk Two Moons"" too.I'm looking forward for my Language Arts teacher to getting me another Sharon Creech book.Thirten year old Zinnia Taylor lives in Bybanks,Kentucky.One day she discovers a mysterious trail.She was determined to uncover that trail.Her Uncle Nate doesn't want to tell her where that trail goes. What she doesn't know is that many secrets will be uncovered at the end of that trail.What will the secrets be?Read the book to find out.It's a really good book and it's worth reading!"
4,SWV - the Glory Years.,"It's difficult to remember the glory years of SWV, a sassier, more street-savvy version of En Vogue. While Destiny's Child traded in their soul for radio-friendly Black pop, SWV never strayed from their r&b/hip hop roots. Their singing, annoying for some, drew no complaints from me. On their hits collection (which, apparently, replaces an earlier compilation that had fewer tracks), we get all the singles from their albums including lesser known songs. Who could forget the straight-to-the-arrow ballad ""Weak"" or the funked-up ""Right Here,"" which smartly sampled Michael Jackson's ""Human Nature""? I also dug ""I'm So Into You"" and the downright catchy ""You're the One."" Personally, I'm disappointed that they didn't include the 1997 jam ""Can We"" (featuring Missy Elliot), but that's hardly reason enough to shun this disc. Though SWV weren't the best all-girl group around, they made a respectable imprint in 1990s r&b, and this retrospective is worth a listen."
4,More Complete Than Previous Collection,"This is the second compilation in as many years focusing on the music of the once-popular girl group,who,though quite successful,always managed, even at their peak, to fall under the shadow of fellow R&B queens En Vogue. This package is slightly more complete than the previous, though it too manages to omit 'Can We', arguably one of the group's shining moments. Conversely, it includes some of the trio's minor hits, chief among them the sparkling and highly underrated 'It's All About U', from the group's uneven sophomore effort. Also noteworthy are the extensive liner notes, reduced to a meager paragraph on the GREATEST HITS cd, but here lengthy and quite informative.Of the two collections, this remains overall more complete."
3,Incomplete Collection,"This collection of songs from SWV's 3 (yes ONLY 3!!) CDs is a great bargain. You get most of the hits by the group, and the liner notes are very informative.The sound quality is top notch, and this CD is a better buy than the previous & lackluster 'SWV Greatest Hits' CD.I won't list all of the hits on this CD (they're already listed above by Amazon!!), but the omission of the MASSIVE HIT, 'Can We ?' cost this compilation 2 stars!! 'Can We' had prduction by Missy Elliott, and appeared on the 'Booty Call' soundtrack.There is room on the CD for the track, so what's the deal ?? Anyway, SWV didn't have the best voices & harmonies (EnVogue, Jade, Xscape, and even Ex-Girlfriend could blow them away!), but they did have a handful of hits, which were pretty essential for thier time. Nice CD, but without 'Can We ?', it's incomplete, BIG TIME! Peace, S.D.(fr.'Chaka's World')"
4,Hyvat Parka A+,"I have been looking for a parka that was as close to my Army Gore-Tex as possible but in a color that is acceptable to wear at a civilian job. Camouflage doesnt really go over to well in the corporate setting. I have tried several other Gore-Tex knock offs but none fit or resisted the wind and rain worth a damn. This parka really fits the bill, the fit and finish is very good and the stow away hood is a plus. There are only two things that keep the jacket from being perfect for me. First, the material is very noisy when you move around, second, the jacket doesnt come with a fleece liner and there isnt a way to attach one to the inside. Other than that this is a great parka at a very good price."
3,Fit is large,"I wear a medium and bought a small and I was swimming in it.If you will wear a down jacket underneath, it might fit after buying the next size down.Lots of pockets and well made.Very stiff fabric."
3,Decent,Nice quality on the wig part. But the bandana is almost permanatly attached to the wig. you will have to spend some time if you want to use a diffrent bandana with it.
3,Try this title instead,"My rating is not so much on the content of this book, but on the skyrocketing prices of it since going out of print. This title has been printed by the same publisher under the title ""The Practical Homestead: The Backyard Handbook for Growing Food, Raising Animals and Nurturing Your Land"" and should be a much lower price. Do your self a favor and get it from the library or purchase the reprint.The Practical Homestead: The Backyard Handbook for Growing Food, Raising Animals, and Nurturing Your Land"
4,An Event,"Ferdinand de Saussure's work in linguistics was a conceptual breakthrough in that he broke with the comparative approach of traditional philology. Saussure argues against the study of mere semantics and phonology and locates the object of linguistic study as the structure of sign and signification. Although there is a failure to truly resolve the problem of the linguistic unit, Saussure still makes brilliant conceptual breakthroughs regarding the synchronic-diachronic distinction. Although much of the content of this course is no longer accepted my contemporary linguists, this text is still a landmark in that it would later prove to be crucially important to the achievements of structural anthropology, philosophy, and literary theory."
5,New Critical Edition,"Many of these comments pertain earlier editions of this work, but readers should be aware that the 2011 Coulmbia University Press edition is a big improvement. Using Wade Baskin's classic translation, it includes introductory material and notes that take account of recent scholarship, including the discovery of a lot of new material by Saussure himself."
5,Profound,"For anyone wanting to understand structuralism or post-structuralism, this is the beginning and the end. This work is profoundly important and provides a new window through which to view the world. It is a treat to read and discover!"
1,disapointed,"I ordered a new book, received a worn book. I'll never order online again. I feel ripped off. $80 for an old used book. A terrible experience."
4,Worth the subscription,"Aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine, and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout. Although ostensively devoted to art photography, many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism.If you are primarily interested in just art photography, and can subscribe only to one magazine, I would suggest ""Blind Spot""."
5,Pleasingly Interesting,"Aperture mixes interesting pictures, that are satisfying to the eye with more mainstream pictures that would appeal to all categories of photographers. Aperture is for those who do not like there pictures characteristic of so called ""normal family pictures"" These pictures are amazing... Aperture magazine is amazing...If you are thinking that it is not worth the price, think again because Aperture will definantly have you taking and seeing your pictures in a whole new light."
1,Pretentious and Plodding,"Aperture is THE premier photographic magazine today... which is to say it embodies all the fashionable cliches and pretentions of the contemprary post-modern scene.Out of focus shots? Ragged borders? All here. Family snapshots reinterpreted as high art? We got 'em. Egocentric self-portraits by the dozen? Step right up.The ""art"" in Aperture is uniformly artless, deadly dull, and devoid of any human feeling. But that's what the critics are selling these days."
1,Not so artistic imo,"I went to local book store to see few photography magazines, including ""Aperture"", to see what makes this magazine so famous and all.I just quickly flipped through pages then there were those BnW pictures...men and women having sex in bushes...like...2 couples or so...Wow....it made me sick...although those pics didn't show such nudityit was the idea. What's so artistic about BnW pics of a guy reaching inside a woman's underwear? or Is it that something 'amateurs' like myself cannot possibly understand the true beauty of those pictures. I say it's just BS."
5,very quiet and sturdy,"I used this model to replace a burned out model that was included in the low priced PC case I purchased. It fit right in and runs cooler and quieter than the broken one I took out. This particular model has the 3 power connectors for the motherboard: the usual 4 pin, the usual ATX 20 pin, and the 6 pin ""AUX"" connector my MachSpeed P4 motherboard needs.Antec has a 3 year warranty so keep the receipt papers.This model has twin blue LED lit fans. The bottom fan runs all the time; the back fan runs very slow until a heat sensor indicates it has to run faster; it's not the hot summer now so that has not happened in this new install."
5,Finally--A Doctor/Manager Who Knows What He Is Talking About,"The practice of medicine has become increasingly complex. Sadly, for many who chose the field to care for people, it is becoming more and more of a business. Rimar, a professor at Yale and a Director of their medical group, developed a course for doctors to educate them in the realities of management and business. The Yale School of Management is a co-sponsor of this effort. Rimar has accomplished what no other physician has been able to do in this area. Perhaps because he is also a practicing anesthesiologist, he knows how to communicate with physicians and other healthcare professionals. This book is superbly written, of great practical value and belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who is interested in or considers him or herself an expert in health care."
2,A General Management Book,"This book is a general management textbook with a title targeting physicians. While the first section has some information about the current state of the healthcare industry, the remaining core sections of the book on financial management, organizational management, and management skills could be stripped out of just about any management text. This book will give you high level concepts of business management and some general business skills such as how to read a financial statement, but will provide no nuts-and-bolts instruction on how to setup and manage your healthcare practice."
3,picture keychain,ok...it is very small so the pictures are large. They quality of the picture is ok. I would buy a larger one next time.
1,Not good at all,"The protective leather case is very flimsy, doesnt fit the V180 properly. The hands free doesnt allow voice activated dialing, like other earphones for the V180 do. The only thing that works well with the V180 is car charger."
1,Cheap crap!,"The phone bra doesn't fit well, the ear phone doesn't work! I am using the car charger, seems to work. Hopefully it will not damage my phone as it is not the OEM model. I would not purchase this item again. Cheap is cheap, and next time I will spent more and get OEM."
4,"Good, but...","Charger works, earpiece works, and the case LOOKS good, but you can't close the phone all the way (even enough to turn off the button lights/hang up) with it on. Still, I bought the kit for the first two parts, and it was a good deal even just for those."
3,Bicycle water botte w/steel cage Pyramid pro,item received in timely manner. Very good product. Priced just right.
5,All of the Best - Live?? No Way!,"There are no real words to describe what it is truly like seeing these guys live - this collection is the next best thing to being there! The philly duo has been making music for over 20 years and today they sound better than ever. Soulful tunes with a rock edge has been their mantra from the very beginning and no one does it better. The collection encompasses songs from the deep, dark 70's to the dance, pop intensive 80's. Seriously, if you have ever loved Hall and Oates, but never seen them live - give yourself a treat, right now!"
5,Ooga Booga is a masterpiece.,"Ooga Booga is the greatest game of all time. It makes me want to run around my bedroom in my Tarzan outfit and beat my girlfriend with my club. It reminds me of my former job as a rodeo clown where I could just pull my pants down and smile while my life was on the line. I highly reccomend this to anybody who thinks they can handle this outrageously wild game. From the second I popped this bad boy in, I could not get enough. The makers of this game deserve to win an Oscar for creating such a magnificent piece of artwork. I have played many video games in my 45 years on this earth and none can even begin to compare with the excellence of Ooga Booga. If you haven't experienced the thrills of Ooga Booga, your life up to this point has been a total failure."
3,Its ok...,THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS LIKE HAHA AH NO!! Ooga Booga is based on some weird characters like fatty hottie and some other doofoses. This game is where you are on an island and try to bonk other people to get points. You can use Boars which make you go crazy or birds which you can drop bombs with.Online is fun for awhile but then gets boring. And not many people play online only about 4 people.
5,unsung hero,"This is an excellent portrayal of the life of Galbraith, set in the surrounding economic and political history of his lifetime. I highly recommend it for these reasons.In addition, a theme of Galbraith's understanding of the combination of economic and social and political currents is made clear. Impressively the lack of appreciation by the political and military figures in the US government during different presidencies, as well as the political bias affecting Galbraiths peers in the academic world comes through.In a world full of people nursing their own ends in the Air Force, government party line, and econometric biases, Galbraith's genious went often neglected or countered. But he remained able to speak to the public at large in his writings, providing a guidance of uncommon sense in his lifetime. This book presents his case admirably."
3,"Not bad, but not the best.","This book is more from the male's perspective--Dr. Jason Steel, Emma has more secrets for him and the reader to discover. Slowly it gets revealed that she was jilted by the badboy of the small town that Jason has moved to. Moved to in hopes of escaping the fast paced life he was leading with his fast paced fellow doctor girlfriend. Low and behold both former flames reappear and cause mayhem in the protagonists getting together.Of course all is happily resolved in the end. However, it is never clear why Jason has decided he needs a wife, and why specifically he wants Emma. I was never entirely convinced of their real allure for each other. I would also have liked to have seen Jason's doctor life---country wise play a greater role. Reaffirm the life left behind in more ways than the crummy exgirlfriend."
4,A nice read!,I particularly loved the hero of this novel. THoughtful without being a hypocrite. Just the way I like it. written to the taste of M&B readers so there's not much to say on the originality or the lack of but truthfully a good book.
5,"Best ""Biography"" about Christ - not sentimental.","If anybody would like to read a life of Christ which is in keeping with all four Gospels, I recommend this book. Goodier writes such that the reader ""experiences"" Christ's Life as if the reader were actually there - seeing Him heal, speak, and even weep. It is great meditation, and very thought provoking."
5,One of the best CD's you'll ever hear,"I agree with the other reviewers..This shows the diversity and abilities of this group. This CD will appeal to even the most critical music lover. This is a must have, and it never leaves our stereo."
4,Kenmore Air,"Interesting book but thought they could have dedicated at least a paragraph to the fatal crash on October 1, 1977. Pilot Greg Thompson and 6 passengers lost their lives."
5,Success on the Step,"Success on the Step is a ""Must Have"" for aviation enthusiasts -- especially those in the Northwest! Chances are you will run into someone you have actually known. Not only is it interesting and familiar but it's a fun, fun read."
1,Lufia: The Ruined Legend Returns(Nintendo Game Boy Color),"Lufia: Game Boy Color game, it stinks so bad, the game is just about religion and what not. This game is SO boring that it doesn't even deserve to be played. If you want a game goto Digital Press and pick up a copy of Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. This game is the worst game ever in that matter; if you want your 10/10 get an original game boy w/ all of the Super Mario Land Games."
2,I hate random dungeons,"I was not fortunate enough to have played the SNES game, but I thought this game was a major snore. I really hate random dungeons. Actually, I'm not thrilled with dungeons at all, but these were longer and more tedious than any I had ever dealt with before. The story was bland and the characters were not well defined. It's also full of spelling and grammatical errors that should have been caught if they'd spent more time on it. Altogether, this game struck me as a rushed job by people who don't really care about it. The save system stinks too. I hate only being able to save my game at certain times, I can't guarantee I'll have several uninterrupted hours to play and I like to be able to stop when I need to. Also, the story sequences take way too long."
4,"Lufia the Legend Returns, by Josh","If you like the Final Fantasy series or Dragon Warrior then this is the game for you. The main characters name is Wain and he can be assisted by up to eight other characters. You and your eight friends must stop the evil Sinistrials from destroying the world. When a battle starts with an enemy you select three of your nine characters to do battle with the enemy. You may have to battle several openents at once. The graphics are good, but not as good as Dragon Warrio 1,2, and 3. All in all if your looking for a challenge, then you should pick this one up."
2,I am the author...,"...and I apologize to those who were not happy with this book. This book had such promise when it started but at some point an author loses control of the final product even though it's their name on the cover. The editing and editorial process of this book was such a horrific experience (keep in mind this was my 3rd book with these publishers) that it has turned me off from doing any future work with this organization. This book was written during a ""changing of the guard"" at the publisher's and it showed in how the author(s), and their work, is treated. It is sad, if not heartbreaking, but when content is sacrificed because the editorial staff does not listen to the author the result is sadly self-evident."
1,LAN Switching First-Step,"I bought Lan Switching first-step and Computer Networking First-Step (by Wendell Odom) at the same time. I found that every single page written by Mr. Odom very refreshing, easy to read and understand. I only have to read what Mr. Odom say once to understand the concept.On the contrary, I have to read 60 percent to what Mr. Catelli say at least 3 times and still do not feel that I understand what he said. Mr. Catelli teaching style and writting is very confusing to me.Henry Tran."
1,Wrong parts and overpriced too.,"According to your information in your chart, I purchased an accumulator for a 1985 Chevy El Camino. What you sent was the wrong accumulator. I bought one locally from Advanced Auto Parts for $20 less than you charged.I also purchased 30 pounds of 134R (freon) from you for $299. Could have bought it from Advanced Auto Parts for $250.I also bought an A/C air compressor from you which came with the wrong pulleys on it and took all day (and lots of cussing) getting the one I took off the old compressor installed on yours.All these parts were available right here, no waiting, cheaper!!I won't order any more car parts from Amazon."
2,Hard to rate,"This book is hard to rate.It has the ""Richard Jewell, suspected Atlanta bomber""-type plot line, of a schoolteacher first hailed as a hero, and then dragged through the mud as a suspect in a bombing.In one sense the book is ""reported,"" but the author does a good job of portraying the main character's life frustrations as a single parent struggling to be a good father and good schoolteacher. The author also catches the bizarre aspect of life, where the teacher's innocuous actions of visiting the bathroom and not immediately telling the police about his bookbag, together with a few details of his prior life, are suddenly magnified into proof that he's the bomber.On the other hand, there's the tiresome ""Muslim bomber"" stereotype, and the ending sequence which is both unbelievable and disappointing.It's definitely readable but has significant flaws."
2,"Intense, but a little too earnest?","This story starts very well. Fire and mayhem. But doesn't develop all that well. I could forgive the slight lack of plot direction, if I believed more in the characters. But I find Blauner tries to hard to press all the right emotional buttons - and pushes them too hard. I find I can predict what agony he is going to pile on next. I'd believe in this writer more if here were only a little wit, lightness or humor just now and again. He's unrelentingly grim for most of the time."
2,"For a thriller, it's not very thrilling","If this book had not been a selection of my book club, I would not have finished it. There are simply too many good books to waste time on this one. When I described this book to people who wondered what I was reading, they almost always said, ""That sounds good."" And I thought, ""Yeah, it should be."" So how does a writer who chooses such a clever premise for the book muck it up so badly. My theory is that maybe he ""reported"" the book. Someone told me that Blauner is a newspaper reporter--and maybe that's why he ""reported"" the way the characters were feeling, and why the characters responses ""Oh no. The bus is blowing up"" seemed so wooden. Perhaps as a reporter, the author is not accustomed to exploring the varied motivations and reactions of people to life events. Or maybe he's just a bad writer...Skip this one."
1,Really disappointed,"Very dissatisfying read. Could not identify with any of the characters. Way too much time spent on the terroists plot. Too little on the investigation and activities of the newspaper involvement. Really thought it inapproprate for the times with all the school involved crimes.However, did finish the book, wanted to see what happened in the end. Didn't like the end!"
2,Incomplete,"Having read this book post-9/11, I found some of the references to Afganistan and the mindset of the bomber and his comrades very interesting. However, I was disappointed that many of the characters were described so vividly but then they disappear and never are mentioned again. So what was the point? I gave this book to my mother-in-law. I told her that I didn't want it back. It's not a ""keeper"" and I don't recommend purchasing it."
2,Sorry I read it,"I found Man of the Hour to be very unsatisfying. The action scenes were not suspenseful. The characters, particularly the school children, were painfully stereotypical. Nor were any characters particularly likable. I'm sure Blauner was going for an ""imperfect hero"" type in his protagonist, because he bluntly tells us this during the course of the story (his symbolism is about an inch deep,) but, wow, he could have tried to make him at least realistic. The teacher's supposedly ""hip"" style of talking to the children and his quest to ""connect"" with them is sadly unimaginative and sometimes just plain embarrassing to read. Most frustrating is Blauner's penchant for telling us what people are feeling or why they're performing particular acts. I'd much rather observe their behavior myself and draw my own conclusions. Blauner's obtuse narrative style makes for a very impersonal and unchallenging book. On the plus side, it's pretty short."
1,No Substance,"With all due respect to the author, there is not much to say about this one. The plot is not interesting and it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into the story. This book could have been written in 20 pages. Very disappointing. Don't be fooled by the references on the back cover. The only by-product is it makes you appreciate Richard Jewel's (person accused of bombing the '96 Olympics in Atlantic) situation. Spend you time and money elsewhere."
4,Entertaining Page Turner,"This is a book right out of today's headlines. Extremist Religious groups, Overzealous Media, Misguided youth, Violence, it's all in this book. Yet the plot brings this all together in one believable story. The author does a great job at showing each character and why they are performing such atrocities or why they have such courage to stand up for their believes. At some points you almost feel sorry for the bad guys because you know why they are in this predicament. This is a fast paced story with great characters and plot development, you will find yourself turning one page after another while you are engulfed in the story."
3,"I don't know why, but I liked this book","This book was compelling from the first page. The relationship between the main character Fitgerald and his flawed wife showed that heroes in books don't always have perfect lives. The terrorists lives were interesting but, only because I wanted to find out what they would do at the end.There was nothing spectacular about this book, but for some reason I kept reading and reading. I think it is because anytime you see a tragedy happen on the news, you wonder how you would have reacted in that situation. You wonder if you could have been a hero. In this book, a boring average guy becomes a hero and has to deal with the resulting publicity. Then he becomes a suspect and has to overcome the adversity to get his life back.I think the plot is what kept me reading, and not the characters or the style of the author. I don't think I'll read any more books by Blauner unless they have a great sounding plot, because I don't think he can carry a story on his own."
4,what is a hero?,"This novel is about David Fitzgerald, an above average teacher at New York's Coney Island High School. He is teaching his student's about character's in literature and what being a hero, or being tested is. David becomes a hero and then is tested by becoming a pariah. The media put's him on a pedestal and than cut's the pedestal down in a matter of hour's.The character's the author creates become people we care about and empathize with, even the mad bomber."
3,"Fast start, slow ending ...","Like many novels I've read recently, the last quarter of the book can not keep up with the rollercoaster thrills of the early chapters. I was hooked quickly, the plot is right out of today's headlines. However, I disappointed with a ""gotta wind this baby up"" quick ending. Plus, why were so the many of characters just left hanging, ie: what happened to the early cops and the newspaper and media slugs and the attorneys ... I wanted to see all these guys dealt with thoroughly by the author ... they all deserved their due."
3,Good Texture -- Biggest Asset,"Peter Blauner's MAN OF THE HOUR isn't as socially relevant and scathing as it wants to be, with familiar situations and an all-too-tired attack on the media weakening its finer points. The characters aren't as vivid or richly defined as in Blauner's THE INTRUDER, yet they'll do. But what gives this novel its girth is the gripping atmospheric texture Blauner is famous for. He (along with Richard Price) manage to pen New York novels that are completely original in their sense of time and place."
5,enjoyable thriller,"This is a thriller, of the terrorism subset, but not quite the standard story. The protagonist is an English teacher, and the book is one you wouldn't be ashamed to open in front of your own English students."
5,A great mystery book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Since I am a teacher, I can relate to the ""hero"" being a teacher. He had real life problems and delt with them in a realistic manner. This book fed on some of my fears about what can if your life gets out of hand through no fault of your own. I liked this book from the first page to the last."
4,GREAT THRILLER,"This is a very good thriller about a hard-working high school English teacher who is thrust into the media spotlight as the hero de jour when he saves a student from a school bus bombing. However, the media attention eventually fades and the teacher becomes the number one suspect in a federal investigation. Good plotting and character portrayals. My only criticism is that much of the high school student dialogue is unrealistic and the ending was a tad forced. Good examination of heroism."
4,Strikes true in an age where the media defines the news.,Combines a taut thriller with a commentary on today's media and how the news is quite often slanted for the sake of sensationalism. A satisfying end without being a fairy tale.
5,Cyril Ratel mens chronograph,"After owning this watch a week, I would highly recommend it. It is sizeable, but not too big on your wrist. The finish on the stainless case is beautiful and well done. It also has a screw on case back which I dont think is mentioned in the description-but a plus. Like my Tissot pr50 chrono, and about in the same price range,this watch is an excellent value for someone who is able to recognize and appreciate the quality difference of a Swiss Made watch. Many fine features for the money."
4,The Math of Gambling,"A nice book that covers games that Sklansky thinks the smart player can win, poker, blackjack among others. Most valuable for the teachings of odds versus probability and other math equations that help the player know whether he has the best of it."
5,ATB,"This album is great, ATB's sound is way above par trance its unique, laid back, chill but still manages to create that surreal experience and move you.. It screams FLOW in a unintelligeable rythem.. If you like trance minus the repetitive beat ATB lays the sonettas down.."
3,Okay but not great,"These steps were about the best plastic ones I could find but they are just okay. Other steps commercially available were way too small and narrow and definitely not suitable for our 10-year-old 50lb boxer. These were, at least, easy to assemble. These steps ""give"" a bit when she steps on them and the lightweight, hollow plastic pieces make the unit feel less-than-sturdy even when placed on a non-slip rug. The steps are are tilted at a slight upward angle which makes them a little awkward for her when decending, a simple right angle step would have been better. Overall, she doesn't really care for them and they are now just taking up space in our closet. For inexpensive plastic steps, these are okay, just not the steps I was hoping for. I guess I'll have to build my own wooden ones to get the quality I really want."
3,Too steep for my chihuahua,"I bought the 2 step heavy duty version because of the 12 inch x 12 inch step treads.If you look at the alternate pictures of this product you can see that the 2steps are at a noticable downward slant. My chihuahua learned to use the steps going upbut wouldn't go back down due to the downward slant and height of the steps.This product would have been better if the steps were level. 2 steps that were levelwould have worked fine, even though the total height would have been a few inches less.I returned the product."
5,A language all their own,"Now I must confess to being biased about The Rodeo Eroded as the violinist of Tin Hat Trio is my daughter, but from that priviledged position (and it is a priviledge), here goes. My test of all cds is whether they bear repeated listening. I put them in my car cd player and listen again and again. Some pale after only one or two takes. Others, like Glen Gould's Bach get richer and richer as my ear hears more. I find that all of the Tin Hat CDs stand the repetition test. Listening after listening they yield things I hadn't heard before. The music does pull from many roots, but it speaks a complex and cohesive language of its own, and that language becomes clearer the more one listens. The trio's live performances reveal an improvisational vitality not fully apparent in the CDs."
5,God Bless DJ Mix CDs,"Heard the track ""Bill"" kick off a UK dance (jazzy downbeat) compilation and had to hear more. Anyone coming here from a similar route should be reassured that they'll love this album. Although the pigeonhole is 'American roots' there's an eclectic mix of melody and drama that makes this stuff accessible to all. Buy it, its lovely !"
5,The Sleeper Album of the Year,"I just listened to Rodeo Eroded. This is music at it's finest. It's Parisien-style Jazz, Southwest ballads, Sweet Bluegrass and the prettiest Willy Nelson song I've heard in years. Bravo Tin Hat Trio. You're going to have musicians beating down your door to guest on your next CD. I'm sending this CD as my musical gift to all my friends who LOVE music."
3,Micro-managed power,"3 1/2THT offer highly unique avant-western chamber music of sorts...each album I have heard sounds compellingly worthwhile, but TRE, while being no exception coming chock full of coiled instrumental payoff, misses overall greatness when becoming embroiled too often inside its own admittedly interesting mechanics as opposed to transcending them."
3,Almost,"I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this, my first Tin Hat album: their music seems just my cup of tea, judging by their single, ""Helium"", a personal favorite. Generally, this album was mostly a disappointment, however. A piece would start promisingly, then become repetitive and aimless, even veering way too close to the inane ""plunk, honk, tweet, thud"" school of modern classical music. BUT THEN... Oddly enough (no pun intended), the last five cuts were the strongest. ""Under The Gun"" was a kick. With a little more drive and a little more coherence, Tin Hat could be great."
5,"Naldo, This Is Dope","Guess what, I just got this album a couple of minutes ago (I'm at work). The company I work for won't get anything from me until I'm off today coz I can not concentrate on anything else! Naldo, go get this album cuz Phonte and Nicholay did sumthin for us...Music! I'm out, gotta play track 2 again...Just stopped to write this review.Calvario From Mozambique."
4,Love in cd case,This is a true music fans cd. If you are a hiphop fan cop this because it really is refreshing to listen to a cd and relax. This one takes you there and you wont want to skip a track. The Justus League is really putting out great work right now
4,Pretty Music Indeed,"Just now as I was doing my research for this album on Amazon, Scott Woods from Columbus best described Connected ""If a rap record can be ""pretty"", this is the one."" The music that MC Phonte (of Little Brother) and Dutch Producer Nicolay together gave birth to is beautiful. A vivrant and soulful album, its perfect for listening to on a saturday afternoon, drinking some beers and hanging out with good people. Nicolay's style is sort of a combination of Jay Dilla's electronic percussion and 9th Wonder's jazzy loops. Maybe the similarities between 9th wonder and Nicolay is what helps Phonte shine and make this album an easy and pleasant ride. My only beef with this album is that sometimes the songs all sound the same. but thats just their style. ""Good people, good music good loving in my life, it makes me happy"" from Happiness. Well said."
5,My toddler's favorite!,"This book is by far the only one that has withstood the test of time in our library. It is colorful and the photos of babies and toddlers playfully interacting with puppies of all sizes are just precious. Unlike other baby books, this one hasn't been tossed aside and forgotten. Our two daughters keep coming back to it day after day.They can pick out the objects on each page, imitate the sleeping baby, the licking puppy, and the child eating in her highchair.My only regret is that briefly my younger daughter went through her chewing stage on the spine of this little book and ruined it, but we will replace it before it falls apart."
3,Grain Hauler,Purchased for a 4 year old grandson and it wasn't durable enough for him!! Details of hauler were wonderful.
5,a children's book that is interesting for adults too!,"I just read this book, written by an English teacher in Kenya, about the incredible life of Mekatilili wa Menza. She was a brave and proud leader of her village against British imperialists in the early part of the 20th century. It seems that she is a rare creature in Kenyan political history, a woman who had the ear and the hearts of the men as well as the women when she spoke to her people about the importance of defending their land and their customs against the invasion. Wish I could find more information in English."
4,Brave Sleuth,"Callie Webber, the protagonist, in this novel is much braver than me; she pushes forward in her investigation where I'd be curled up in a ball, shivering!The tale moves at a steady pace, with a few twists and turns. I must admit, I did not know who the antagonist was until the author revealed it.In addition, I learned a good bit about growing and harvesting apples. This is a good read.Thank you to FirstWildCard and Karri James at Harvest House Publishers for my copy."
5,Like to travel? Like to cook? Do both!,"Do NOT be intimidated - I am barely starting to do more than very basic cooking and the cuisine of Tuscany is my favorite. The instructions are clear, I had with me a friend who is a very good cook and this book worked for us both, doesn't talk down to you and it doesn't make you feel like an idiot.Perfect timing, too - start with summer and spring recipes, I find those not only more appropriate but a bit easier."
4,"For Those Who Love Tuscany, This Book Has It All","This book is much more than a mere cookbook, as Pino Luongo shares his love of Tuscany in a friendly informal way that I found particularly appealing. The book is divided into the four seasons as Mr. Luongo feels this best reflects nature's lead. The recipes are very easy to follow, containing easy to find ingredients, and he has added a number of menu selections sprinkled through each chapter. Having lived in Italy for 8 years myself, Tuscany was one of my favorite regions, and I thoroughly enjoyed traveling back there with Mr. Luongo in this book. If You love Tuscany and it's food, you'll enjoy this book."
5,so good I don't still have it!,"I loved this book, it has been picked up and taken home by others so often, I have no idea who has it."
2,Digital PRINTING made easy!,"This is a pretty good video on what to do AFTER the pictures are taken! If you want to learn ANY kind of photography skills this IS NOT the video u want! It deals with memory cards, TONS of printing suggestions (This is 90% of the video, all are common sense if you know anything about what you are doing) and cropping.I was hoping it saying, ""digital photography"" it might have something to do with PHOTOGRAPHY(even just seeing him take 1 picture)...it should be called digital printing made easy! I am glad i borrowed it instead of buying it."
3,"With notes at the end of each story, this would be a Kindle five-star","I agree with previous reviewers that this is a great selection. The introduction is perceptive and helpful. The text is almost error-free. One editing change would have made this a superb Kindle purchase: put the notes at the end of each tale. I'm half-way through the collection, and by the time I get to the end, I will not care what the notes mean. Maybe I'm missing a technological short-cut, would love to know."
2,Some useful information,"This book contained some useful information with regard to negotiating, and some of the basics of investing in real estate, but in my opinion it is far from a 4 star book. A major problem I have with this book is all of the success stories about Mike- that go something like, don't expect this to happen often but Mike once did this or that- the stories are very unrealistic."
2,OK ok ok ok,"This book was ok, some good points OK, the part I do not agree with is having a property manager so you can run out and find more deals. Really I have experience with bad property managers what a joke. This book should show you the most key important point is to make money managing your own Real Estate OK, not paying some Property Company to keep eating your profits, how to buy and manage your own Real Estate is the true key to make you Wealthy in your spare time. This is book I thought is for the small time investor and seems written for some guy wanting to buy 100 single home units. I have a feeling there is a better book out there to explain what this book has passed bye. If someone out there can tell me please do."
5,Investing Works,"Ive been a Carleton Sheets disciple for 7 years, have appeared on his commercials, and am on his recent training videos. I own over 70 rental units including apartments, houses, duplexes, and commercial buildings. I met Mike Summey in Chicago a couple of years ago at a Carlton Sheets photo shoot. Mike and I hung out late into the nite night and talked about real estate. I read his book and definitely picked up some ideas from it. I want to learn new things all the time. I had a million dollar net worth before I was 30 and Mike's book is definitely a great book for the starter investor. Quit thinking about getting righ and GO DO IT!!!"
1,"motivational, but little value","In the book there is nothing you can't figure out yourself in no time, if you want to do real estate business. If one needs learn anything from this book, he is unlikely to be success in real estate business (or any business for that matter)."
1,The weekend Millionaire's etc....,Just wondering if any Canadians have read this book and have applied it to real estate investing in Canada?
4,Great information for beginning investors,"I must have a different edition of this book than some of the other reviewers. Yes, this book is not for the so-called ""expert"" real estate investors nor is it for the ""know-it-alls"". The author basically tells you his story of how he got into real estate investing and what you need to do to follow in his footsteps. Is there a silver bullet to this? Absolutely not. Does the author imply that you buy low and sell high as some reviewers suggested. Well, from my reading there were many instances where the author bought properties ABOVE what it was worth and KEPT the property for renting. Hmmmm. There goes the buy low sell high theory. All-in-all nothing worth getting is going to be easy and this book should be used as a stepping stone into a lucrative longterm real estate investing career. If you are an expert or know-it-all why bother reading this book?"
3,Hard stuff,"I read the book and it was quite a bit of hard work. I can only recommend to people who love maths. For all others, especially biologists and people more interested in the biological things: it is not worth the money.If the author would use a more coherent and explaining style of writing and reduce formulas for every single detail it would be much better."
5,Review of AmLactin XL Cream,Product is everything it claims to be and do. Showed excellent results in clearing up dry skin within a few applications. Would recommend the product fully!
3,very moisturizing but contains bad ingredients,"This cream works very well. I noticed results in just a few uses (I stopped using it after just a few times because of the ingredients list). It immediately moisturizes. It is a little greasy and it is very thick. It works better than the regular AmLactin. My dermatologist recommended this product for keratosis pilaris on my arms. I also used it on my feet.Contains parabens, mineral oil, petrolatum, and propylene glycol! These are things that I avoid."
5,Are you an Ichthyosis sufferer?,I suffer fron Ichthyosis Vulgaris and have been using Lac-Hydin and Amlactin. They work pretty good but I'm wondering If the XL does a better job?
3,works good - smells bad,got a sample from my dermatologist - liked it --tried to buy it at walmart - it was 39.00 so i found it here for 20.-- but the sample smelled ok - but this big tube is not pleasant
2,not worth the money,AmLactin XL. Did not find it effective enough to justify cost. Will not purchase again.
2,I really wanted to leave an amazing review...,"I received and began using AmLactin XL in the middle of May. I am 23 and have had enough of being embarrassed of my upper arms. After much research, I decided to break the bank and purchase this expensive lotion. It is now middle of June and I have seen little to no improvement to my KP... I'm hesitant to say this, but I feel like it has gotten worse. The lotion is very thick and is a great moisturizer, however it is sticky which makes me feel ""clammy"". I have tried using it on patches of eczema and it does give relief to the very dry skin. I am also not fond of the smell; it isn't strong, but it is noticeable, which makes me wonder if others can smell it. I've given this product 2 stars because it is a great moisturizer, but did not work for the reason for purchase, which was my KP."
5,Cheaper than pedicure,"Works great and I was an unbeliever. First given to me by pediatrist sample. NO more pedicures, my rough, dry feet are baby soft."
1,it smells BAD...what does this mean?,"I was very surprised the first time I used it. It smells exactly like my hair color (peroxide). This can not be good. It feels stiff shortly after applying. And sticky. But mostly, it smells really bad!!"
1,AmLactin has changed ingredients,"Having used and depended upon AmLactin for over 10 years, I'm extremely disappointed with the 'new' AmLactin. The new stuff is thick and heavy, does not absorb nor does it help relieve dry skin. Changing the ingredients makes no sense when the original was so wonderful."
4,go to amazon international : UK,"Thanks to the reviews here, I ordered the Transporter/Stanley Clarke CD from the UK. It took some time, but was well worth the wait. It's very true to the movie with only a couple things missing. Now, is there any equivalent CD out there for The Italian Job?"
2,I don't remember hearing this,I was really excited when I bought this CD. I unwrapped the case thinking that the same driving tunes that had played on the big screen would be piped through my headphones into my waiting ears. Instead I was assaulted with track after track of nothing but rap. Call me crazy but I think that techno was the staring music in this movie. There were three songs on the CD that I remember from the movie and found tolerable. I know the movie had a large sound track and it would be impossible to fit it on one CD but maybe they should have included some more recognizable songs. If they were to release another CD with the techno on it but I would say this CD was not worth the price I paid unless you really like rap
2,Movie vs Soundtrack Music,"I bought this cd a couple of days ago and I was quite disappointed because the catchy song that I liked wasn't there. Remember the very first track playing during the second/third scene wherein 4 guys robbed a bank, then the police were chasing them? It was a long and furious chase and man the song that was playing was so incredibly hard to forget and I thought to myself...hey I gotta buy this cd! Whoever knows the song title, please do tell me! Sometimes movie soundtracks can be really disappointing..."
1,Thank you for informative reviews,"I don't understand why a CD that's supposed to be a movie soundtrack doesn't have the music from the movie! I learned to beware of soundtracks ""inspired by"" the movie. Shame, but thanks to everyone here, I didn't make a mistake in buying it. And thanks to Amazon for listing tracks here, too. Helps prevent unhappy customers. Now I'm looking for the soundtrack to Transporter 2 here. Hopefully it will really be music from the movie! Can we use Amazon.UK just like the one here? They'll charge my card and handle all that money conversion stuff? Thanks!"
1,ACTUAL Soundtrack IS available on Amazon here,"Just do a search for ""OST Transporter"". This is the original movie score CD, more expensive because it is an import, and takes a few weeks to ship."
1,Disappointing...,"After seeing the movie and hearing all of those awesome songs, I raced to find the soundtrack and found this piece of ... Not a single song from the movie, no techno, no rock, just hip-hop and rap. Very disappointing if you wanted the songs from the movie."
2,ok,This is a moderately intertaining CD that I listened to for a year and threw away. If you like to movie it might be for you.
3,is techno not music??,"Look man, techno is music, rap is music, so customers who pay their money for a soundtrack of a movie expect to get ALL the soundtracks that they heard while watching the movie, i dont get you. Ive ben looking for alot of that cool ""theme"" music from the movie and it just seems a little lame that its not on the soundtrack. Is there a problem with that? People who are looking for ALL the movie tracks wont find what theyre looking for on this CD."
2,okkkay,"If you have seen the movie, I recomend you not buying the soundtrack. I personally thought it bites. In the movie, there is all this cool rock music, but on the cd all there is ""music inspired by the film"", and it is not what I expected. I didn' like the music, I did think that one or two songs were ok. But the rest were boring (I don't mean to offend anyone who likes the type of music that was on the CD). I wish they would make a new soundtrack with better songs, and THAT WERE IN THE MOVIE!"
3,Missing a lot of good music from the movie,"I bought this because I thought it was have a lot of the cool Euro Club Cuts that were featured during the fast driving chase scenes in the movie. Not a single one on there. It's mostly rap, which most of the songs are good too, but I didn't want a whole CD of it."
2,THANK YOU to the music fan from Poughkeepsie,"I purchased the US soundtrack to the Transporter b/c i loved the movie....Talk about disappointment when i heard the songs... there was like 3 songs from the actual movie.... Thanks to the music fan from Poughkeepsie who informed fans like me that there is another UK soundtrack version available! I just bought it, thanks a bunch! I loved the various little pieces of music from the movie and i was so sad when the US version didn't have hardly any of them.... :( Anyway, so in all i ended up paying a whole lot more than what i had intended... but at least i found what i was looking for."
1,Hope some of you are still reading...,"[Too bad] about the US release. Typical. I've been 'burned' by this nonsense a number of times: little or none of the actual movie music on the [darn] CD.In sympathy, I direct you to the Norwegian band Royksopp and their album Melody AM. Track 4, 'In Space', may be the driving tune you're looking for. William Orbit is also good. You can always still try and obtain the euro-release of this soundtrack....Enjoy. ..."
4,The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance,"Here, Arthur Versluis breaks new ground, showing that many writers of the American Renaissance drew extensively on and were inspired by Western esoteric currents. Thus he demonstrates that Alcott and Emerson were indebted to Hermeticism, Christian theosophy, and Neoplatonism; Fuller to alchemy and Rosicrucianism; Hawthorne to alchemy; and Melville to Gnosticism. In addition to offering a detailed analysis of the esoteric elements in the writings of figures from the American Renaissance, Versluis presents an overview of esotericism in Europe and its offshoots in colonial America. This innovative work will interest students and scholars of religion, literature, American studies and esotericism."
3,New and not improved,"I bought this model to replace a Sony TCM-500, which I liked very much. This new model, however, is not made as well and doesn't have the same quality as the 500. It also does not reverse itself, which is a very important part of recording with it since I usually need 1.5 to 2 hours of recording time, sometimes more. I have tried several brands of tapes and Bias I and Bias II, but the reproduction is not as good as the 500. The price, however, was very good and despite my complaints it is well worth the money."
4,Nice little recorder,"I love the voice activation feature of this recorder- it works like a charm. There is rather high background hum- I haven't tried playing back with noise reduction but that might do the trick. I could only get it to work on 1.5V batteries and not my 1.2V NiMH rechargeables, even though fully charged- a disadvantage though 1.5V rechargeable alkaline batteries are apparently available. This little recorder otherwise filled the bill very nicely."
5,Bird Watchers Digest,I purchased this subscription for myself because I'm a birder. I'd previously subscribed to this periodical but let it lapse. Loved the magazine before and still love it. Great info for anyone who loves birding.
5,Why Is This One So Little Known?,I have over a hundred Christmas CDs and I look forward every year to listening to this one.Special recognition for the Liza and Alan Cummings selection and one of the most beautiful White Christmas arrangements I've ever heard by Audra McDonald.It's one full hour of the best voices on (and off) Broadway.
5,Awesome Band!,"Someone needed to write a review of this band cause I havent seen one for any of their CD's yet. I came across them when downloading a Methadones CD and saw them in the ""Customers who bought this item..."" section and decided to check them out. After downloading the rest of their stuff, I can honestly say this is one of the best punk bands to come around in the last few years. All of their stuff is extremly catchy, the kind of CD you can leave in your car and listen to over and over. Mostly your typical poppy punk but some of the tracks are a bit heavier. The combination of having two vocals in most songs adds a lot too. Check them out, I guarantee you won't regret it."
3,meh.,"I have been listening to punk rock for over 15 years. Its my love. But as far as this particular style of punk goes, their sound is not my fav. To me it SLIGHTLY sounds like blink 182 or some other radio ""punk rock"" crap genre. With further listening though, it is growing on me. I adore pop punk but give me Chinese Telephones or the Shorebirds...Sloppy Seconds, the Ergs, the Descendants or NOFX. This does not completely measure up in my opinion."
4,HEADBANGER MUSIC,"I LIKE IT. THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY WAS GREAT FOR HOME MADE DVD. THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THE HEADBANGER MUSIC THEY USE TO ANOY ME. BUT I AM OLD, OVER 45. EASY RIDER, NOW THAT WAS A GREAT SOUNDTRACK! IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC,YOU WILL LOVE IT! CLOSE TO 3 HOURS LONG! I EVEN BOUGHT THE SECOND ONE. WHICH IS ALSO GREAT! DISPITE MY DISLIKE FOR THIS KIND OF MUSIC! THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB! I LIKE IT TOO! GREAT FOR BIKERS OF ANY AGE!"
2,Homemade video,"If you expect to learn how to built a bike or get more knowledge about this, don't buy this DVD. It is a homemade video where a few amateurs over the U.S. tells you how to make a cheapest bike. Any bike building scenes anren't provided. The best looking bike in this homemade video is the one that was bought over the Internet, all other bikes just look like junk which you can ride."
1,Choppahead,"It is a little difficult to rate because I have not received it yet. There are many products I have not received but have paid for them as Choppertown dvd also. Please contact me because I have stopped to buy due to poor delivery. I think it is outrageous that Amazon.com can not deliver products!!!!! See for your selves; purchased Aug. 2006! It is not to believe. I have sent you e-mail about this before, still no answer???regards,Andre RifaatCell: +47 906 37 232"
5,Going deeper in urban tourism jungle,In this fascinating book Martin Selby takes the reader deeper into urban tourism jungle than any other writer on the subject. A must read for all aspiring and experienced urban tourism researchers.
5,nice shoes,"they are very confortable shoes, very nice to outdoors, um the upper its perfect to the hot cuz keep u foot with the fresh air let in."
5,The Art of Clarence Williams,"The Figure of Clarence Williams is considerable,-as a prolific composer,accompanist,and bandleader;however very little is known (or heard) of him by the average jazz lover;fortunately,Amazon has made available this excellent volume to an excellent series to help jazz lovers today appreciate this outstanding jazzman;this disc is culled from his 1927 discs and are a splendid introduction to Williams' stylistic versatility.A Must-Have disc for the serious lover of the art of jazz!"
2,This game is a waste on most every level,"...I admit, the programmers did their homework and many facets of the game are right out of Norse mythology for the most part. But the fact that this game takes so freaking long to load in between levels is really annoying. Especially if you happen to get killed. I can understand a long load time if the level is massive with lots to do, but I swear I had a 2 minute load time for a level that I cleared in about 30 seconds. That wouldn't be so bad, but it happens again and again in this game. Rent this game if you must or wait for a sale, but don't pay more then [alot]for it or you'll be sorry."
1,Bad but ok,ok ... lets make this really fast and straight to the pointthe game itself and in total is badthe graphics could have been better for being made for ps2 i mean is better than ps1 but they could have worked on it for a bit moresecond...the controls are terrible ... it takes so long just to figure out and actually feel comfortable with your character because of how the button are configuredthird...it takes forever to find out the plot and stroyline of the characteronly get this game if you are desperate for a game ... but as i see it there are better games out and coming out
1,Amataur 64 bit graphics,Avoid at all costs. These guys were just not up to the challenge of making a PS2 game.
1,Just no Good.........Period,"First, the graphics look that of playstion 1.There are no guns.....which made me madThe story is no good either.All you do is go around slashing in multiplayer modeOn a scale from one to ten....I give it a -ten.I rented it for five days and returned it the second day.Also, the sound sounds like super nintendo"
1,The worst PS2 game I've played yet,"Man this is the worst game I've had the misfortune of buying... I mean customer who'll buy it off me. Anyway the graphics take us back to that old PS game Akuji. While that's not all that horrible I thought I'd at least get Soulreaver graphics on a PS2 game! Also the brightness of the game is pretty low. Going in the water is horrible, you can barely make out your character! The load times are also longer than the single load time on NBA Live 2001!! Also the game seems to load at every minor junction. Just getting past the training portion I had to wait for loading about 6 times!! Finally the controls are not bad but nothing to write about, so I won't. Overall I was highly dissapointed with the game. More than I want my money back, I want those missed hours of my life back!"
1,Think 10 times b4 you buy this game...,The graphics in this game strongly reminds me of the PS 1 era. The character is hard to control.
1,if you buy this you just waisted 50 bucks,"I cannot stress enough how horrible this game is, it was the first game I bought for PS2 and I was so dissapointed the graphics [aren't good], sound [aren't good], control [aren't good], story [aren't good], everything on this [isn't good]. If I had to say anthing good about this game it would be very hard but the closest thing to being cool on this game is that after you kill a guy you can throw its bones. This is no reason to buy the game as throwing the skull at enemies is pointless as you will miss your target every time and then pressing the wrong button results in throwing your weapon into a lava pit. this is a game that Atari could mach its capabilities with."
1,I don't like writing bad reviews,But this was one of the worst. I have to agree with most people here. Avoid Rune at all costs.
4,Great Game!,"This is one great game, the graphics really arent that great but it is easily overlooked, do keep in mind the age of this game. The overall premise is that you die, odin brings you back to life and you must journey through Hel in order to get back to midgard. The game is completely immerced into the real and dead on Norse Mythos, this game is very different from any other game that i have ever played. to gain health you must drink mead, eat meat and lizards. all the levels are all very dark and very disturbing with everything trying to stop you from skeleton soldiers to demon vikings, this game is overall incredible, if youre into metal, and more importantly bands like Amon Amarth you will love this game!"
1,IT STINKS!!,The controls don't work and you can't get anywhere in the game. I was really disappointed that I wasted my money on this game.
3,"Fair game, not worth an A+","I guess this game graphic wise is decent due to when it was released but my main problem with it was the load times. Some points were pretty cheesy, like eating lizards to replenish health. The voiceovers weren't that great either but I guess they were good at the time. Another thing I didn't like was when you were in first person mode and you were using a weapon, you couldn't see it. This game is beyond being perfect in anyway but it's worth playing if you rent it or find it at a very cheap price. Don't expect too much from this because you're not going to get it."
3,OK,"Pros: Incorperation of actual Norse mythology into storyline, weapons (bigger and better the further you go), challenging levels , nice long game.Cons: SLOW and numerous load/save breaks, mediocre graphics, bad guys too easy to kill.Overall I found Rune to be challenging (not the bad guys, but the levels) and it definitely gets better as you progress. The only major issue I had was the low load speeds, that really gets old."
1,"""Worst Game ever""","To quote one of my favorite simpsons characters, the comic book guy, this is the worst game ever. I was at the store and I only had .... I had heard of Rune on PC and it looked pretty cool. I saw it on the shelf and it was only ...I should have known that a PS2 game that is under ... is probably going to ... hard but, i bought it anyway. worst mistake of my life. THE GRAPHICS ARE LIKE SOME OF THE EARLIER RELISES ON PS1!!!! the controlls are allright. THERE ISNT A REAL STORY. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET FAR BECAUSE IT IS SO BORING TO EVEN WANT TO PLAY IT. when I look at my shelf of games the ones that pop out at me and scream ""PLAY ME I AM FUN"" are FFX (which is the best in the final fantasy series so far), GTA 3, Tony hawk 3, and metal gear solid 2. But little old rune is seperated from the rest. Its in the back collecting dust. I think im going to go spit on it right now. In conclusion: whoever gave this game over 1 star is insane. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
1,Ruined Rune,"This game has to be the worst game I have played...ever in my life. The graphics were terrible, not anywhere near what the PS2 is capable of. Game play is very weak and boring, the blurry man viking is hard to control, and you have to save the game every 10 seconds. The load time is very slow, but not as slow as the storyline. The only good thing about this game, is that I rented it first, praise the Viking Warlord."
1,RUNE VIKING WARLORD,"Yes I know I wrote already but, I also forgot to mention the loading time of this game is about 1/2 a min every time it loads. Also, It seems like each level only takes about 5 min the you can save and wait another 1/2 a min. The animation is very weak and is a bit choppy and the camra angles while swimming are even worse than if you are on land. I own 30+ video games for the PLAYSTATION 2 and 200+ video games for the PLAYSTAION 1 so, I'm not blowing smoke out of my we'll you know anyways, If you bought it and liked it well happy for you but, I was disapointed. Sad to say $50.00 is a lot of money so, I think I'll read reviews first."
2,It's not worth it.,"I was quickly bored by both the arrangement and the quality of the performers, I didn't get it so expensive (over 60 bucks as of this writing) but still, it is already gathering dust on the unused cds box.If you love final fantasy IV music, there are better offerings out there, including the music from the original cart.If you love celtic music, there are loads of offerings out there that will not burn a hole in your pocket.If you are a total fan that has to own all things FF...or totally deaf for quality celtic music, go ahead an get this."
1,Eating Disorder Recovery?,"The Barbi twins went through a lot struggling with their eating disorders. I could relate to their pain yet I couldn't see where the pictures were helpful. People actively struggling with an eating disorder will not benefit from this book. The pictures seem to be detrimental for one who has a distorted body image already. Truthfully, I took this book and showed it to my therapist and we threw it in the trash together."
4,"Good, but could have been much better.","I admire Sia (or is is Shane) for having the guts to write this book and tell about all the insanity that bulima/anorexia can do. However, I have to agree with the other review that mentioned that how the airbrushed to perfection photos can only ADD to a readers mental condition who already has a distorted body image as is. While they should keep the photos, they should have also added some REAL life UNairbrushed photos to show the reality of the disease.It would have been better if she would have told HOW she got recovered, (IF they ever did). Plus, I was vainly curious as to what they did to keep their waists sooooo small even when at their heaviest.Im going to try their diets in the book, and see if they work. Now that she is a certified nutritionist, Im going to assume she knows her stuff on this one."
2,It was okay,"The book was not what I expected. I thought it would be more like a novel, although it did have useful information on nutrition."
2,poor release,First Priesthood cd is very goodsecond is even better.I like those 2 releases.good west coast music.This new one I dont like at allto hard beats compared to the rap.the rap aint like it used to be in the first 2 albumsits softerbut beats are harder then ever.wich aint a good combo imo.I give this 2/5 though.
2,Probably not worth $50US,"My experience suggests that online help and the ""Learning to Program with AVENUE"" (LPwA) manual included with ARCVIEW software is more helpful while learning and programming with AVENUE. As a beginner, working though LPwA was more helpful than this book. My experience with AVENUE is that learning to use the online help (it includes the object model for AVENUE) is the most valuable skill an ArcView User can have.My suggestion: work through LPwA, learn to use the online help, and spend $50US on a good Visual Basic book (or ArcObjects Developer's Guide by ESRIPress - ~$30US), because AVENUE may soon be phased out in favor of VB in coming versions of ArcView.Good luck!"
3,Needs a statement and object property index,"This book lacks something very fundamnetal : a list of avenue statements or properties. I was trying to write a simple script to turn a tables scientific name data into the proper form, but other than a brief mention of uppercasing in the first chapter no refernece was made to any of the string manipulation features.Eventually, I found what I was looking for, in the ArcView help file, but it would have been nice to just look up a statement or object property in an index. The book does have some useful examples, but for the price I think the author should have included a list of avenue statements with a brief format and use description."
2,Look closely!,"Of the 34 tracks, it seems that only a portion feature Glen Campbell solo (very few of his classic core songs). There are various other artists featured including several instrumentals. I tried to see all of the tracks before I bought and even emailed the vendor for a list but received no response. Now I know why! In addition, the disc was copy protected so I couldn't transfer to MP3 to play on my portable."
4,Good bag...only one complaint,This is a good size bag (I can fit items for both my kids in it). My only complaint is that it doesn't stand up when you put it down....so it always ends up lying on the floor....
3,"great bag for the Bob stroller, not around town","I love the colour as it matches the Bob we got of Craigslist. It is amazing to have with the stroller, but I really do not care for it on it's own. It would be perfect if the top closed! (I thought the flap went over the top but it's just a side flap) So it seems like stuff might fall out, but then again we use cloth diapers, so they can be a bit more bulky lol"
5,BOB Stroller Bag,"The BOB stroller bag is a necessity when using the BOB Revolution Stroller. It hangs on the handle and this is useful because the carrier portion on the bottom of the BOB stroller is not easily accessible and does not offer a lot of storage space. Only draw back is that when using the BOB stroller bag, the BOB cup holder drink console cannot attach to the stroller handles. Am trying to work around this, but so far all the reviews I've read say you can use one or the other. Also, the Amazon website shows the stroller bag as Mesa Orange with brown trim, however, BOB strollers changed the color scheme and now you receive Mesa Orange with Camel trim. Overall, I highly recommend the BOB stroller bag. Although it is small, it works well with the BOB stroller and provides much needed space for baby items"
5,Perfect!,"This is a great bag! I have found everything useful about it, especially the fact it attaches to my bob. Cute colors and fits costco wipes!"
3,Eddie and The Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!,I received the DVD but not the CD. I was a little disappointed because in my opinion the soundtrack is awesome in itself. The movie had a litte grainy appearance almost like it was transferred from VHS. Other than that the movie is excellent and highly recommend it for the music. You will find John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band at it's best!Eddie & the Cruisers 2: Eddie Lives!Eddie and the Cruisers (1983) / Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives! (1988) (Totally Awesome 80s Double Feature)
2,Didn't work for me,"I was very morningsick through my pregnancies....I ordered this years ago but it didn't work for me. Maybe it will work for others, pretty much nothing made me feel better."
1,i need negative stars,"like everytone it seems who purchased one of there burners, min e lasted just about a year and died. The company was very good about replacing it, it only took about a week. The trouble was, that one only lasted another 4 months, then died.I only wish there were stars to take away"
3,informative but ugly,"This book has a ton of buildings in Long Beach. Some of them aren't very pretty buldings to begin with, but the prose explains their significance well, making up for it. However, the layout, photography, and design of the bok are seriously lacking. While, I think whoever published this book did themselves a huge disservice by not putting some effort into making the work presentable, it is a great collection of information about interesting places in Long Beach."
4,A Comic Look at Siblings!,"Megin a.k.a. Megamouth and Greg a.k.a. Grosso are brother and sister growing up in suburban Philadelphia. This book is a light-hearted most of the time obvservation of sibling rivalry in a family. Jerry Spinelli has written other winners like ""Loser,"" ""Stargirl,"" and ""Maniac Magee."" I have to say that this book is okay for young readers and adults who appreciate the lighter side of life.The relationship and situation between Megin and Greg remind me of a sitcom on television. Each sibling takes turns in this book about the way they look at things. It's not ingenious writing but it's well to do for it's audience. I think it could be better. As Spinelli kept writing his books, he does get better."
4,Read this book,"this is a really good book about a boy and a girl who are siblings. they really hate each other, its told from both of their point of views and they both have different things going on in their lives as well as each other.its really worth reading so you might as well buy it."
4,My favorite book from Jerry Spinneli,"Who Put That Hair In My toothbrush is a great book, but I think Fourth Grade rats is a better book.Who Put That Hair In My Toothbrush is about a girl named Megin and a boy named Greg.If you read this book you are going to be confused on the second chapter, because there are only two names for the chapters, Megin and Greg.The chapter called Megin is about Megin.The chapter called Greg is about Greg. Megin first thinks that the girl from California named Zoe is weird but when Megin gets to know she is really nice.They became friends. All summer Greg was trying to get a girl named Jennifer to like him. When he goes back to school he found out that she moved. He tries to get her through her friend named Sarah that stills sees her. Greg realized that he likes Sarah. I liked this book because it's interesting"
4,Who Put That Hair On My Toothbrush?,"I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys seeing two very different people talk about the same subject. You can really focus on this book and connect with the characters. Every couple of chapters, there was a surprise that grabbed your attention even more. There are a lot of funny scenes and weird but believable events. A few of the chapters end with a cliffhanger. For example, on of the chapters where Megin is the narrator, it ends with `It was a long time before I looked up and finally, finally saw the girl from California."" I really enjoyed reading this book and would read other books by Jerry Spinelli because I like his style of writing."
5,Great book! Shows the realistic side to family life!,"I absolutely love this book! I first read it when I was 9 and I am still reading over and over at 14. I can compare myself to Megan and Greg in so many ways. Who Put That Hair in My Toothbrush? teaches numerous life lessons about making friends, learning to love siblings, etc., etc., etc. This book brought out so many emotions in me, from laughter to sadness and is at the top of my list, for all ages!"
2,sort of disappointing,"Frankly, folks, Spinelli can do lots better than this! He's proven it with books like Crash, Loser, and (most of) Stargirl. So what in the world happened to him here??? Both of the main characters here are incredibly immature. I think junior high and high schoolers should be insulted by a story that portrays them as so shallow! The constant name-calling, whining, lying, and so forth really got on my nerves. True, toward the end one tragedy and another near-tragedy bring Greg and Megin closer together. But by then you may not like them enough to care. And a couple of Spinelli's much more likeable minor characters, such as Megin's ""adopted grandmother"" Emilie Bain, are hardly developed. What GOT INTO Spinelli here? This book is tremendously skippable. Read Crash instead. ""Sibling rivalry"" gets a fairer portrayal there, even though it's not the book's main theme."
1,Inappropriate material,"This book is poorly written, disgustingly inappropriate, and crass. The characters are rude to each other. It references periods, maxi pads, virgins, groupies... it clearly shows the problems in today's society including lack of respect for each other, lack of dignity, forget grace, that's long gone... Do anything with your money other than buying this book."
1,This book sux,I can't believe ur accually thinking about buying this book! What is wrong with u? I would of rated this no stars but they didn't let me!!!
4,A Good Start,"As a student of various languages, I have always been intrigued by the languages of South Africa; in particular, their click consonants. I was looking for resources in Xhosa, and instead came across this book. Zulu, I have been told (and can affirm), is easier than Xhosa. This book begins with a decent introduction to Zulu's phonology and orthography; but I think it could have been more detailed and with more examples (especially on the CDs). The course is decently structured and seems to cater to both serious students and casual students (ie, those going to South Africa or a neighbouring country). It goes beyond the language itself, into topics such as some aspects of the Zulu people's culture. This book is a great reference for beginners of Zulu; and worth the price."
3,"Decent book, be careful to buy the one with the audio!","I've just gotten into the book, and it seems fine to me. Definitely a beginners book, but that's what I wanted. I was under the impression it came with a cassette or CD (the book even refers to listening excercises on the cassette), but this one doesn't come with it. There is another item on Amazon (same book or at least the same general title and authors) that says Audiopackage specifically in the title - buy that one."
4,The Start of a Terrific New Series,"The young Bond is at boarding school at Eton where he finds himself in the middle of his first mystery. While in Scotland, James finds that his enemy George Hellebore from school is visiting as well. A young boy goes missing and the clues link the abduction near the Hellebore Estate and to the work of a madman that is working to create a genetically altered cross between human and beast.This adventurous new series will appeal to both young and older Bond fans. Silverfin is the beginning of a fun series that will give readers a chance to see into the life of James Bond before his 007 womanizing days.Silverfin is undoubtedly a great beginning to a fantastic new adventure series. Terrifically crafted characters and an adventurous plot make for a page-turning read that will please Bond fans of all ages."
5,Great story!,This book is absolutely wonderful. Charlie Higson has realy outdone himself in this outstanding book about young James Bond. It's a quite intriguingly good book and deserves a place in every home. (It's a great book so you better read it.)
5,Silverfin,"When I first got the book Silverfin I just wanted something to read, but when I started I couldn't stop.Silverfin is the beginning of a series called the Young Bond series, a series that tells the origins of the spy legend James Bond.The story starts telling the horific story of Alphie Kelly a young boy who vanished while illegaly fishing on Loch Silverfin.At the same time in England James Bond is starting bording school at Eton, a run down school that's Motto is we will endure. James is expecting to not like it, but suddenly comes across an enemy. George Hellbore a rich american, whos father is Lord Randolph Hellbore a very wealthy gun producer.But when James goes to visit his aunt and uncle in Ireland, he helps a young boy named Red Kelly, they become an unlikely pair. Kelly tells James about his cousin Alphie and James is sure it's Hellbore.They sneak into Hellbore Estates and James discovers the truth about Alphie, and discovers the horrors hidden under ther great castle."
2,Silverfin,"Do you like bloody details and action? Then read this book it is full of it. Silverfin by Charlie Higson describes the life of young James Bond. James goes to Eton a school for boys that is in Scotland. He is befriended by some boys there and is fairly happy. Then he meets George Hellebore. George and James are rivals at first sight. George teases and hurts James. James gets back at George by winning a race. George is furious and threatens James. Last, James goes to visit his aunt and uncle. On the train he meets Red Kelly and helps him. James finds out that George is on the train. One night James and George run into each other and George jumps him and is about to kill him when Red Kelly shows up and saves James. As you get deeper into this story, you will travel into the Hellebore castle with James. This question will race through your mind will James come out alive? Don't read this book if you are faint of heart.By: Lou"
2,This ain't no Jimmy Bond!,"Don't waste your money. This was written by an author in his sleep assuring it didn't get in the way of his real job. It is a very turgid and fractured piece of writing, where themes with the hint of promise are not fully explored leaving the book plastic and vacuous in feel, like a hermetically sealed meal. Only few - VERY few - characters are well-defined with some sense of past associated to their current actions. Worst of all is that the very good work developed in Mr Higson's Silverfin has not been capitalised upon. In the first book we felt the era in which Eton had existed - now it is just a pastiche; a short nod before getting into the Bond-movie like action. A great shame, and anyone really taking time to give this nonsense five stars would also possibly be shopping tonight at the Supermarket for that hermetically sealed meal!!"
1,a thirteen-year-old's standpoint on this novel...DON'T GET IT!,"Ok, I got this book anticipating something VERY exciting. When my mom and brother and I go on long trips, I normally read books to them. Well, my brother kept asking me to read Silverfin to him and I gave in, of course. We read the prologue and I noticed from the second paragraph that Charles Higson has TERRIBLE grammar. Not only does he have the WORST writing techniques ever. You should never spend more than three sentences describing something. Well, that's what he did. And it was a little gruesome. If you insist on wasting your time reading it and you're thinking, ""Everyone's a critic"" then go rent it at your libary."
4,A Good Start,A good beginning to a series of Bond as a younger person. It will be interesting to see if Higson will come up with story lines that explain the idiosyncracies of Bond as an adult.My only criticism is that the book was very wordy and often meandered-Fleming's books were always terse and to the point.
5,Harry Potter for Bond fans!,"Bond fans will love this fast-paced adventure from their hero's adolescent years. It's well-written, exciting, and altogether more satisfying than many of the ""adult"" Bond novels written by various authors since the great Ian Fleming's sad demise. Don't let the ""young readers"" label put you off this thrill ride. I'm already looking forward to the next one."
2,"James Bond as a boy,","The idea was good, James Bond as a boy but it was set way back in the stone age days. Well written by an old man who probably likes old stuff and based the book around the 1950 James Bond so this is like 1930's.It's would have been better to write it in the 1970's 80's or even 90's to bring it to modern day readers, who actually watch the latest James Bond movies not the old balck & white versions.Probably best for adults not children"
3,okay but not brilliant,"If you want a descriptive spy adventure read it.If you want a fully action packed book DO NOT BOTHER!!!!!!!!!Great idea, part 1 and 3 are good.The middle spoils what could have beena great book all the way through.Might be just me though."
5,This book is great!!!,This book was great it didn't just go right into the action but the story kept you intrested over all the series is worth buying
3,Could have been so much better,"Most of the other reviews here are from people who are massive fans of James Bond, and I'm sure for them this book is interesting. But as a story in its own right, Silverfin is, at best, mediocre. As a book for boys it just isn't good enough, I'm afraid.It takes a very long time for the action to get going, and the character of Bond himself is completely blank. Then when the action starts it is too predictable and same-y.I really recommend these books instead, which are better written and more exciting: Anthony Horowitz's 'Alex Rider' series, Joe Craig's 'Jimmy Coates: Assassin?', or the 'Cherub' series by Robert Muchamore."
2,Don't waste your time - there's much better out there,"It's a shame, but the other reviewers who only gave this one or two stars are right - this was one of the most disappointing books I have ever read. It should have been AMAZING but it wasn't.The whole of the first half is exactly like one of those old books for girls about what life is like at their fancy school. Then there is some action eventually (if you haven't given up by then through boredom). The main problem is that even the action is not exciting because the character of James Bond himself is comepletely dull. Not even dull - not there at all.If you're looking for something great to read you should go straight for the Alex Rider series, as the other reviewers have said. Also, you have probably already read those, so go for Jimmy Coates: Assassin? by Joe Craig - it's just as good as Alex Rider and way better than Silverfin."
1,I hate this camera!,"This camera was not my choice. I received it for my birthday after suggesting that I might be interested in a long-zoom digital camera with image stabilization. This is my third digital camera. I liked my 3x Olympus, 3 megapixel but thought I would like the additional features that I just mentioned. To begin, I hate everything about the Easy-Share program. The image stabilization does little or nothing for me. Even a tripod is not paticularly useful because the camera lacks opportunity for remote shutter release, the camera IS slow, the flash is weak. In most of the scene modes (and flash), the shutter is too slow for me to hand hold. The movie mode has great picture and sound but movies can't be burned to DVD for showing on a conventional DVD player. To me, that means this feature is next to useless. Controls are too complicated. About all that I can say for it is that it looks good. I'm just glad that I still have my Olympus!"
5,This Camera is a Winner!!,"Kodak has a winner with the P850. Excellent Kodak colors and a 12x zoom with IS-image stabilization--that allows you to take rock steady pictures even at full zoom. Add to this the optional easyshare printer you can get through amazon and there is no competition. The printer puts a clear coat on each print that prevents color fading and smudging--a problem with some ink-jets. No computer is needed, but if hooked to one, e-mail can be sent at the touch of a button. And it even recharges the camera! the Kodak easyshare system is tops!**I did notice Luis' comments below on the camera. Luis seems to have really negative views, often using foul language and expletives to attack products. He has since re-posted a version of his review and attacks me and another poster, who noted his exteme comments. Anyhow, I hope the average reader gets the picture about his reviews in general. Hey, Luis! Whatever you buy next, I sure hope that it does not ""suck!!!"""
1,Worst Digital Camera Ever!!! Kodak Sucks!!!,"I bought this camera 1 month ago and already its giving me problems. First the software that came with this piece of junk did not want to install correctly. Second the camera would not shut off after shutting it down, it would just remain on with the lens retracted. Third the pictures this thing produces are just horrible. Now I can't even return it back to the store because my 30 days have expired. I will now have to try and sell this piece of junk on eBay for less money and hope somebody buys this thing ""as is"". I must say to the guys who gave this piece of crap a negative review here, that I wish I saw your help-full reviews before I went and bought this camera. I guess thats life, you learn from your mistakes."
3,freezes often,"the P850 continuously crashes.When using burst mode and then taking more pics, without waiting for it to save, it just stops working and loses my pics.As well as when using the AE/AF lock and using f/8 1/1000 ISO50.Try it and see what happens.In any case, shutter lag, the time it takes for the camera to save pics, is simply too long.Focusing is so slow, it's just annoying.The only thing it has going for it is a long zoom, flash hot shoe, and larger sensor than P&S.;[the P712 is an updated model of the P850]"
3,Like New?,Advertised as like new. Besides the worn labels on some of the control buttons and the rubber cover for the viewfinder being missing it was kinda like new....
5,Great camera,I bought this camera in 2006 and it has traveled all over the world. Literally. We bought this before moving to Germany because I wanted a camera with great zoom and quality for all we were going to see in Europe. This camera did all that and has survived two children who were infant and toddler when I first got it 6 years ago. This camera is well worth the money.
4,Nice Super Zoom Camera,I spent a long time ploding through camera reviews for a good superzoom. I narrowed it down to either the Panasonic FZ5 or the Kodak P850. The Kodak P850 had the better feature set in my opinion. Pictures are crisp and color is good.Pros:- Live Histogram(I really like this feature)- Good Color and picture quality- Natural controls that you get used to quickly- Excellent feature set- Good Image Stabilization- Manual Focus- Looks niceCons:- Noisy Zoom- Loses focus when changing zoom- Flash too strong at times- DC charging adapter sold separately- Would have like a wrist strap insteadOverall I am happy with this camera. The noisy zoom gets on my nerves but you get used to it.
5,"Awesome, Especially with the P20 Zoom Flash Accessory","This camera is my third Kodak! It is a wonderful camera. I definitely recommend downloading the new firmware to speed up the shutter speed. (available at Kodak's website) It was a fast and easy thing to do. Also, you MUST purchase the P20 Zoom Flash. It makes your indoor flash pictures BEAUTIFUL. The skin tones come out gorgeous with this flash and it is definitely an upgrade I recommend. You won't be disappointed with the zoom and IS feature. No more blurry pictures in Zoom mode. Love the feel of the camera and of course its ease of use. I'm very excited about this camera!!!"
5,Kodak P850 is excellent!,"This camera is the best I have used. Color is great, the 12x zoom takes steady sharp pictures because of the stabilizer, and the controls are easy to use, much better than my old Olympus 10x zoom digital. The manual controls are reasonably easy. And with a 1 mb memory card, it holds 500 pictures!Great Camera! Great Pictures."
5,"Rod Machado's Private Pilot Handbook is a ""must have""","I'm an experienced pilot (ATP, former AF Instructor Pilot) working toward obtaining my civilian CFI ticket. I obtained Rod's ""Private Pilot Handbook"" as another reference book to have ... after studying several chapters so far, I must say this book is one of the best general knowledge books I've come accross. Rod consistently provides clear explanations and clever techniques to aid in remembering the material. One example is the explanations on VFR weather requirements for different categories of airspace - he provided a neat triangle diagram which greatly enhanced my ability to easily recall all those pesky details. The graphics are outstanding. I would highly recommend this book to any pilot, especially student pilots. I plan on using it as a primary reference for teaching my future students."
5,Frozen Duck Control Freak Godsend,"I'm not happy just knowing what an instrument does. Nor am I satisfied if I can just pass ""The Test"".I'm a control freak. I have needs.This book is essential if this sounds familiar. You won't be left with Whys and Howsats. It's also a great confidence builder for a beginner without the smiling, happy ""you can do it, it's easy! :)"" that seems pretty common in other private pilot material that I've taken in. Some people aren't into the side-stories and ASRS Reports, etc in the book. For me even the doodles on the diagrams help to retain knowledge, as I'm sure Mr. Machado intended.As a new pilot I am absolutely committed to developing the best possible skills, and this book is doing me right where others have lacked. Pick this up with the King's study guides and radio communications guide, then save the rest of your checking account for your friendly neighborhood CFI. Also - read the weather chapter outdoors if you can. Helped me out greatly."
5,Rod Machado's Private Pilot Handbook,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering studying for the Private Pilot Certificate. I have spent the last thirty years working in several aviation related jobs such as a military air traffic controller, airframe and powerplant mechanic, avionics technician, and student pilot. There is a lot of technical knowledge to be learned in several different fields, and Mr Machado did a very good job of helping me to learn new material in an entertaining way. I also gained a better understanding of some material that I already knew a bit about. The book is good at explaining the subject matter in a humorous way that makes it easier to understand and remember. The subjects are well organized and there are plenty of illustrations to go along with the text. I think that this book will also be a good reference to refresh your memory after you pass the written test."
3,Maddening wordiness before you get to the point!,"I bought this book on the strength of the reviews by others. A counterpoint, if I may. In an effort to make the book fun, (I guess), information is often hidden beneath layers of over-simplification and analogy carried on far too long. He had me screaming ""get to the point!"" This lack of crispness in writing style, is frustrating. Others obviously enjoyed this book more than I, but for my learning style, the inefficiency of this writing style was frustrating and time consuming. Not a book to easily use as a reference to specific questions you'd like answered (unless you have a lot of time)."
3,Good info gets lost,"This book has potential and one could certainly do worse. My main objection is that it is too verbose and has too much text that is of no value. Too many cartoons, anecdotes, etc. If Rod could provide a version of this book that gets straight to the point and stays there it would probably get a 5-star rating from me."
3,How about teaching how to actually fly an airplane?,"I've read this book to prepare for the FAA test. The material is well presented and has a refreshing approach to presenting what is essentially dry material. It does cover most of what the FAA test requires, but omits to actually teach how to fly an airplane.The scary thing is that readers may be fooled into believing that reading this book is the only theoretical instruction one needs to safely fly a plane - Wrong!Information that is vital to flight safety is missing from this book. Most of it can be found in Langewiesche's ""Stick and Rudder"".The latter should be required reading for pilots.I guess the blame falls more on the FAA for failing to incorporate this information into the official knowledge test, but Rod Machado shouldn't use that as an excuse for the omission of this kind of life-saving information in a book that presents itself as a one-stop pilot license manual."
2,a frustrating book.,"This book might have the content you are looking for, but it is so tediously written that it's not worth the time. The author treats readers as if they are highschool kids. If you like short and concise books, this is the wrong one. you will be yelling ""get to the point!"" thousands of times."
2,Not for student pilots,"A lively description of what pilots need to know. However, this book should not be used for private pilot training -- too many inaccuracies and not enough detail to get you through the FAA exam."
1,Comic book....,"Sorry guys, but this book is filled with incorrect informaton, ranging from aerodynamics to meteorology. Maybe some people find it entertaining, but as a CFI and engineer I would not recommend this book to anyone. I could spend hours describing all the incorrect garbage that is contained in almost every page. If you are serious about flying STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK.... it will save you a lot of confusion when you'll have to re-learn the correct information.Buy something like stick and rudder or even better the Student Pilot Handbook."
4,Good Follow Up after Obtaining Your License,"I have a private pilot rating and found the book to be a very good referance book AFTER obtaining my rating. If I had to use it for a study guide for the knowledge test I would have wasted alot of time and energy doing so. It is a very good book, but due to his extensive illustrations and coverage it would have been more of a distraction then help in learning the necessaryinformation for the written test. This book goes further into the facts then necessary for scoring well on the knowledge test.His illustrations, humor, detail and perspective are excellent which is why it makes it more suitable as a referance book after the fact."
3,Fairly good information but too many distractions,Overall this is an OK book but I agree with those who find the constant attempts at humor to be rather distracting and even annoying. I also thought the airspace memory-aids were convoluted and made the subject much more confusing. Other than these two complaints I think he provides some very good information in a fairly easy to understand format.
4,"not funny, but good anyway.","The best single source of primary aviation material I've seen anywhere. However, the 2nd-grade attempts at 'humor' are an embarassment."
3,"Great details, except for ...","I am currently hard at work on my Private Pilot Certificate and immersed in ground school. I purchased this Machado book (and his IFR book) and agree with everyone else that it is an excellent reference, very detailed and well organized. But I also found, like many of the other reviewers, that the ""humor"" was a little overboard. Rod's writing style and the illustrations I found to be a little irritating. I am sure others feel the level of humor and the cartoons are just perfect, but I thought it is a little over-done."
4,Covers the basics very well,Rod does his explanations with great style and ease and his traditional humourous manner. I recommend it to all learning pilots.
4,Make sure you have a highlighter pen,"I have to agree with the other reviews on this book. Rod Machado's use of humor and numerous illustrations keeps your studying lively. I especially liked how he can use more than one analogy to explain a topic. If he can't get through to you one way, he has another and possibly a third way to attack the topic. However, his use of humor and anecdotes can make the material a little crowded. I find that I have to reread things at least once before they really sink in. When you want to go back over a chapter, you have to fish through a lot of extraneous text to get to the meat. Judicious use of a highlighter pen helps."
4,Great fun and nearly complete,"As textbooks go, this is a wonder. Machado has a manic sense of humor, and he never stops laughing. Even the illustrations are funny. This is a great way to transmit information, especially to a reader who's been afflicted by the more traditional flight instruction manuals. The organization is good but not excellent (I find it irritating that the chapters are numbered in the table of contents but lettered on the page, and sometimes I can't locate things as easily as I'd like). But it's good to have around, the book you turn to when the others are putting you to sleep."
4,An excellent book for student pilots.,"Rod's book is great! A very thick book which provides good coverage of all the basics, yet injected with a sense of humor not unlike my own, which definitely helps you through the mass of material. It's easy to read over time, in one chapter increments, as your flight training progresses."
5,He has captured the essence of learning with humor.,I am working on my CFI ticket and this is an excellent book to help with putting the essentials of aviation technology in an easy format to understand and use for the new student. His humor greatly aids retention!! It deserves more than 5 stars!!
5,If you Like Guitar Music You'll Love This Album,"If you like guitar music this is the one for you. Byrd Burton is a great player and plays some of the ""classics"" on this album. It is a must have for any one who just wants to relax and listen to great music."
1,Probably not worth your time,"In our super literate and conscientious read group, only 1 of 5 completed this novel. Vidal's knowledge of the period is impressive but his voice so arch and almost parodistic that one remains at too great a remove from the characters and their fates. The same tone reigns throughout the novel so it does not have the nuance, the ups and downs, the emotional grip of truly great novels."
1,Although usually a fan...,"...of Gore Vidal, Empire demonstrates just how boring an historical novel can be when it's all talking heads. Channeling a backstairs-at-The-White-House maid or effete butler, Vidal presents the reader with simply scads of gossip about America's ruling class of the early 1900s and none of the action. Fortunately, it's an easy read as one breezes past the decade between 1897 and 1907 with many a flourish of ladies' suffragette ruffle and gentlemen's cad-like behavior. Even the back-stabbery of political dog-fighting has the pampered whiff of patchouli and cedar-lined humidor. Sadly, unlike his essays and bookchat, and even Vidal's own novel Creation, Empire is as forgettable as his Myra Breckenridge. Having read it from cover to cover, I bid it adieu. You may wish to as well."
2,Major bore,"I realize that I'm supposed to think ""Empire"" is brilliant, because it's Gore Vidal, but it is a major bore. Nothing actually happens; its just 400+ pages of dialogue. A well-written conventional history of the period would be more enjoyable and more informative. This is a total snooze-fest."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Is a great idea--if it actually worked! My parents bought this for our kids Christmas 2009. My kids played with it twice.Today, we tried to play with it again now that they are older and coulod run it more independently. Wouldn't turn on with newbatteries. Tried power cord--nothing! Tried taking cartidge out nad putting back in and same for book--nothing! Called customerservice and they said because it is more than 6 months old, we would get -NOTHING! Too Bad for us that this company doesn'tstick by their product! Any body won't a bunch of books and cartridges--no good to us NOW!"
3,The controller was broke,"The controller was broke and when I called Amazon was told they couldn't replace and I could never find a phone number for the company I got it from. The ""reader"" part is great and my kids love it, but they are unable to play the games because the controller doesn't work..."
2,Need More Books!!,"I'm giving this an overall rating of 2 stars because of the limited book/game selection, otherwise it would have been higher.It seems like a great concept. My preschooler really enjoyed playing the book/game that comes with the Story Reader Video Plus, and also has the 3 other books currently available (Dora, Thomas, Elmo). The video rendering could have been done better (the Dora video doesn't looks so hot on a big screen TV). Some of the games were so simplistic, but others kept my son interested, for a while at least.Why only 3 books?? When will Publications International come out with another book for this thing - if ever? Be aware - books that just say ""Story Reader"" will not work with this - they have to be for the ""Story Reader Video Plus."" If I had realized how limited the book choices were, I would not have bought it."
3,Nice concept,"I rated this 3 stars overall for the following reasons.Durability: My 3 year old has already broken one of the pins in one of the cables. Why they make a cable for a 3 year old that is not a single pin, i do not know. We have only had the reader for one week. Now I have to figure out how to get a replacement cable!Also the limited amount of books for the reader. Come on, if you're going to create a product that reads, give us more books than a handful!Other than that, my 3 year old loves it, but it could be improved."
2,WHERE ARE THE BOOKS?!,"We got this as a present for my daughter's 1st birthday - she'll be 4 this month. Yet, there are only 5 books still?! Great product with great potential, but needs more material!"
5,Moonlight Beauty,"Another sobering beauty of Brian Crain that has reached a new depth in musical and emotional maturity. The piano music has a good harmony on the left hand in complementing the melody on the right hand, simple but graceful and enchanting. Many songs kindle a cinematic splendor with soaring strings, trumpets, and synth washes, like in ' White Dove ', ' Inner Vision ', ' Fly Away ', and ' Innocent Heart '. ' Autumn's Echo ' conveys an uplifting delight besides the solo waltz ' Dancing by Starlight '.A few songs are quietly entrancing with soft synth strings, particularly ' Kindred Spirits' and ' Night Bird Song '. Five pieces are piano solos, of which ' April Breeze ' ( my most favorite ) and ' Light Motif ' are especially soulful and meditative. ' Mountain Meadow ' has a somber tune reminding one of some darkly historical events.This album is a herald to "" Sienna "" in 2003, which carries a more sobering tone and deeper heartfelt impact."
5,Inside the Melody,"Beautiful, soothing music. Tired, need to relax? Play this and let the music wash over and around you. Great stress-reliever."
3,motion blur.......,"This game has te same motion blur from the bouncer. Not as intense, but it is noticable. I don't know why many PS2 games have this blur (maybe to hide its poor anti-aliasing) but it can be a little distracting. I personally liked part 2 myself. Maybe I expected to much from my PS2, or maybe the game just isn't as good as it should be and the same goes for the graphics. My advice, rent it (like I did ) and compare it to the one coming out on Gamecube in November>"
3,"Cool Graphics, Cool Idea, Poor Implementation","I really wanted to love this game. I've loved the Wipeout series since the original. I love racing games, especially non-traditional ones. XG3 is deffinately a WipeOut knock-off. It has very cool graphics. It is a lot easier to drive than Wipeout so people who don't have much time to practice won't be frustrated. I like the idea of getting at least two cycles side by side and the weapons are easy to use. However, the league system they use is pretty lame. I just wasn't very motivated to want to go farther like I was in Wipeout or SSX. Also, while the controls are easy to understand, I had to re-program the pad to really play effectively. The default setup really stinks. Overall, the game just didn't captivate my attention. I suggest renting before buying on this one just to make sure it will yours."
3,Great graphics...,"I think the graphics in Extreme G3 are pretty amazing, and there isn't much slowdown. I'm annoyed by the League system because you have to play the same courses over and over, just with different engines.The weapons also annoy me because they don't really help much, in the ultimate sense. You can win with or without them -- they are just to play with. The rear-firing ones don't seem to do anything either.... I'm sure they do, but you just can't tell.The single most annoying feature, however, and the one that no one has mentioned, and that would prevent me from recommending buying this game: getting stuck on the walls. There is some weird thing; if you get near the edge of the track, you get magnetized to the wall and it takes a second to get off it."
3,"FAst, but doesn't last......","If you like the Wipeout series, you'll like this game. Same look, same sense of speed. The physics aren't as floaty, which makes sense, since these are motorcycles, not ""anti grav craft"".The track design kind of [is bad], too many ""blind corners while going uphill"" kind of things, which aren't challenging, just too hard and mess up the flow of the tracks sometimes. I found control with the analog stick impossible. Plus I finished in about 5 hours of play.......If you can't wait for Wipeout Fusion, buy it. If you can wait, don't."
1,Bad experiance,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
4,Still going strong,Gerald is a great soulful artist. I just can not get enough of his music.This cd shows he can do a little of everything. That voice is something.It is in his genes. His gift was passed down from his father(Eddie Levert).I will surely miss him. Noone can sing like him.
5,SExY Smooth..,"Yup..this is when he is at his best...smooth sexy music with sweet vibes. A another collection of senusal, classic Gerald..sit back and rewind..this is a smooth C.D. and ENJOY.:D"
5,Best Effort Yet By Gerald,"This is an excellent CD. The first time I heard ""Funny"" on the radio, I liked it and was eagerly anticipating the CD to hit the music stores. The only fault is that Gerald can be a little corny at times with the fake laughing at the end of ""Funny"" and using phrases like ""you're making me scream like a little girl"" at the end of the title track ""G-Spot"". But he typically throws in something corny in every CD so I guess I'm getting used to that. Otherwise, I truly love this CD."
2,Big let down,I was very disapointed with this latest project. Stay away from it or buy the bootleg version...
2,"Gerald has a Strong Voice, But Needs to Put the Pen Down","This is the second album I have purchased the the G man, where he has written or co-written most of the material and I must say that while he has a very strong voice, he is not a very talented writer. The material on this album as well as last years Gerald's World lack the depth and creativity seen on his earlier works. I was so dissappointed with Gerald's world, I vowed to never purchase another CD by Gerald without listening to the full recording. Well, I did not do that and here I am dissappointed again. Gerald, if you read this, please put the pen down."
1,TIME TO JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER...,"...or a cd by its woeful attempt to pour soulful music into your ears.It was actually difficult for me to listen to the title track ""the G Spot"", and not laugh out loud. All of the songs except for one are written by Levert, but G Spot sounds like he is literally making it up as the track plays in the backgoround. The lyrics are uninspired....as if he picked them up from some cheap porno movie.There are plenty of other vocalists in this genre that sing, write and sound 100 times better. I'm glad I picked this up from the local library and didn't have to pay for it.If I were on a cruise and Levert was announced as the musical guest, I'd jump overboard."
5,second hand textbook,"the book is kind of dirty on the cover, but there isn't much handwriting or notes. i'm very satisfied with it."
1,"Not yet recieved,,,still","Was shipped the wrong product. Was told I would get sent the correct product but didn't. Called again, the manager replied to me on 9/18/08 and said the correct product would be shipped to me and it is 9/30/08 and I still have not recieved the product. I did recieve a refund for purchase but never the correct product."
3,"Some great soups, some not so great","I've had this book now for a few years. I've made about half of the soups and I could say with certainty that 50% of them are really great. The other 50% are lacking. The pictures are gorgeous, and I appreciate the photographs (why so many cookbooks fail to include photos for every recipe, I can't guess). But some of the soups are very bland, even though the picture is pretty. I have found myself tinkering with the recipes, trying to add some flavor, and have begun to recognize that the soups without spices are really unexciting. Still, a good buy, lots of options to choose from."
4,Good,This is a Christmas gift that was requested. for a family member. Her copy was lost in a divorce.Book was in good shape
4,Nice book,"It was a present for my mother in law. She likes it a lot. The good thing is that it has tons of pictures. The recipes are good, you have a variety of soups to make. I am going to buy one for me."
4,A great beginner's book,"The main strength of this cookbook is its beautiful pictures of soups, followed by the wide variety of soup recipes. It has plenty of recipes that I, who knows nothing of soup making, recognize and make with great success. There is also several recipes that I've never heard of and hope to work up to.As you can see from the contents page, there are many light soups, rich cream soups, hearty soups, and special occasion soups. It has something for everyone on every day. It even makes note of how to convert many recipes to vegan."
3,Very good story...,"Another solid tactical rpg, based on a great story and well designed. Its too bad this was one of the last playstation titles released and has been overlooked for the most part. The only complaint i have was there was little in terms of side quests, and the game was fairly easy. I did not lose a single character in battle, the dojo's for practicing and leveling up was interesting but I found that a little tedious. The missions where better to do anyways cause you could earn gold and why fight for free? Anyways its not final fantasy tactics, tactics ogre, or vandal hearts 1/2 but if you've beat all those too, then this is solid game to enjoy."
3,more than moderate,"Saiyuki is a fun game to play. The graffics are, by todays date, substandard. The replayability of this game has a greater limit however. I've been more addicted to other games. For the price, its worth a buy/play."
1,huge amount of highlighting,"I did get the book that I asked for. I did get it quickly. But there is so much highlighting in it, it is almost unreadable. It was considered ""good"" used, but (since I can tell from the 4 markings from libraries and other colleges)it is ""over used""."
1,Proview Monitors,They blow up at two years. You have to pay to ship them to have them fix. Good Luck. You get what you pay for
5,The book I've been looking for forever!,"This is the book I've been looking for forever, since I experienced my own ""middle passage"" in the early 2000s. Finally a book to help validate ALL of my perceptions,feelings and emotions as I transitioned into my second life, one filled with new fulfillment and meaning.Much I have read says there is no such thing as a ""midlife crisis"" but as a psychotherapist focused on midlife, and as the self-proclaimed Midlife Crisis Queen online, I hear from others everyday who know that midlife can be an important passage from being who everyone told us to be, to who we are inside! It's all about finally accepting and appreciating your own authentic self.This book helps me explain and organize my own ""middle passage"", while giving it the structure and validity I needed. It is also extremely well-written!"
4,Vancouver in midlife ? ...,"An amazing number of people in Vancouver are reviewing midlife crisis books ... is that city going through it's own midlife crisis ?This book is perhaps the best one out there. The reasons are many as others have pointed out, but in my estimation is this: Hollis does not jump into the mechanics of the midlife period, in fact this is not the main emphasis at all. He starts with an in-depth retrospective on childhood and does a thourough analysis of our early years, then guides us into our present state and our future.Highly recommended, yes."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.......UNLESS YOU HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING!,"What a bunch of usless nonsense. Commnon sense would have told you as much & saved you some money! Boring, boring, boring! I threw it in the trash!"
5,Academic in tone but a great read.,"This was a great read and offered a lot of insight as to the drivers some of us experience upon reaching middle age. What I like best is the non-judgmental tone: The title of the book for example (""The Middle Passage"" as opposed to ""Mid-life crisis."""
4,Deep and good,My counselor suggested both my partner and I read this book and discuss it as we went through it. It was great for that as it let us dig deep into our relationship and build intimacy and a greater understanding of ourselves and each other.Both of us found ourselves challenging some of his premises and conclusions but ultimately finding his analysis of this stage of our lives to be helpful.
4,Misleading title.,From the title I thought only people that were miserable in midlife would benefit from this book. I thought it was a book that would benefit everyone before or during midlife to better understand the changes that can be expected.The book described why a middle passage exists. Now I am looking for a book to describe how better to deal with the passage.
3,"Good, but a bit theroretical","If you have studied Jungian physchology, I would bet this is a great book. There is definitely some good material and it helps to provide some insight into midlife issues. Unfortunately, it is a bit intellectual in nature. The pragmatist in me is looking for more direct guidance than this book provides. It also seems like the writer is trying to impress us with his vocabulary - which doesn't make the reading any easier."
5,Taking the Mystery Out of Mid-Life Misery,"After a lifetime of steadfastly holding onto increasingly ineffective ways of dealing with life and its disappointments (large and small), I finally cracked and landed smack in the middle of a mid-life crisis. Divorce, depression, anxiety, and a total loss of comprehension about life's purpose were the wreckage of a lifetime of disowning my authentic self in order to meet the high expectations of others and of our culture in general. As I began to read ""The Middle Passage,"" it was as though a curtain had been opened to reveal a new possibility and the normalcy of the process of mid-life introspection, pain, discovery, and rejuvenation. It's a ""let's grow up"" book, and through its compassionate prose and honest voice it invites one to risk a journey that, otherwise, one might never choose to take."
5,Leap into this book,"This is very intelligent poetry.Vic Rosca writes about love, life,spirituality and the human conditionwith great insight. Fans of Jon Andersonwill love this book!"
4,Van Gogh Fan? This is for you....,this was much larger than I expected--well made-beautiful--sturdy light switch/socket that swivels evenif you need it too.very happy with this purchase.
2,Limited enjoyment,This book is a beginning exploration of the Mesoamerican mythology. It is not comprehensive and is intended as a simple explanation.
3,it drones on,"great EBP includedhe tends to drone onmore of a narrative of the backgreat information, interspersed between a whole lot of fluff"
4,King' Sacrafice will move you!,"King's Sacrafice takes us back to the galaxy with Dion, Sagan and Maigrey. This novel picks up right where the prequel lets off......it is high paced, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. Scenes with Abdiel are very intense, and entertaining. I loved this novel due to the influx of new intriguing characters. See who will finally control the galaxy! Will it be Dion? Or Sagan? Or Maigrey? Or a combination of all three?"
5,I LOVE (!!!!!!!!!) this book! Did I mention I love it!?,"This is my absolute favorite book ever! The character tension is wonderful and though some of you may be disappionted in the ending, I loved it. I feel so sorry for Sagan though. Every time I read this book (thats alot) I have cried!"
5,"Delectable live performance and riveting documentary, Pain of Salvation deliver the goods in spades, many many spades",Setlist; 4 stars.Performance; 98 starsDocumentary; 20 894 starsExtras; 4 starsPilkington; Orange
4,Excellent overall,"This is a very good book on the mechanics of life. The author does an excellent job of explaining the the fundamentals of how we work at a chemical level. He writes in a very clear but sometimes lackluster style (given the obvious ""affection"" he has for the material). Plus he occassionally repeats the same point in consecutive sentences, which often made me feel like I was ""fighting"" this book.One other item that the author probably had no control over: the print (in the paperback edition at least) was tiny. I'm 40 with pretty good vision, but still occassionally had to put this down for a few minutes to get my eyes to focus again."
5,"Charge on, Mighty Chondria!","I am deeply interested in the mysteries of the mitochondria and MD (Mito Diseases). Most of the academic works on the subject are fairly arcane and focus on the cutting edge of the field...what I needed was an insightful overview of the subject. I got even more. It's a great history of science piece that also provides context and commentary on the implications (known and projected) of what we know so far. I read a lot of books on science, biochemistry and health-related research. I wish I could add many more books with the turn of phrase and depth of insight of this book to my list. This book has built the bridge for me, and should provide the platform I need as I seek to parse out what is useful from the more arcane journal articles on the subject."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"As another reviewer stated, this really is a life-changing book. I read it after taking a course in biochemistry and it had even more impact on me in tying a lot of fascinating concepts together.The most amazing thing about this book is how influential mitochondria are on our lives and subsequently how little we (you!) know about them. They're why we(eukaryotes AND warm-blooded animals)'re here, why we're large, why bacteria can't become like us, why we have gender, why we have sex and why we die. Fascinating stuff--definitely a book you should buy (especially considering the title is quite a conversation starter too)."
5,One of the very best biology books,"This is an earlier book (2005) by the author of ""Life Ascending"" (2009). I read it because I liked ""Life Ascending"" so much. This one expands on the role of mitochondria, and is full of amazing stuff I didn't know. I read a lot of biology, evolution, and genetics and this is definitely one of the very best. Lane keeps up with the very latest research, which I wouldn't be able to understand, and weaves it into a coherent story of our best current understanding of what life is and how it works. Highest recommendation. I have just started reading his even earlier book ""Oxygen"" (2002)."
3,Not medically useful information,"This is a well researched book but unfortunately (from my point of view) it spends far too many pages talking about the theoretical origins of life (and the biological research that has given fuel to debates on this subject) and far too few pages talking about mitochondria and their health related implications. There is also not enough clearly written information on mitochondrial function. Although written for the non-scientist audience, it assumes a lot of knowledge about biology.The book is fascinating for some people. My husband thought it was awesome as a good read. But for me, because I was looking for medically specific information, it was a bit of a disappointment. Also, personally I really don't care about the origins of life since it is obvious any discussion on the subject is entirely conjecture. Perhaps intellectually stimulating conjecture if you are so inclined. For me the subject is meh. (Oh no, I've been hanging around with New Yorkers!)"
1,Choppy,"There wasn't much in the book that I wasn't aware of before. This book is really fragmented. It just seems choppy and it doesn't have that flow that good and informative books tend to have.Also, I find it interesting that some people attack negative comments on a book they really like. People, reviews are just reviews. Don't be offended by it. If you loved the book, then good for you. I certainly did not enjoy it even one bit."
5,"general, easy, informative read","This is simply a great book overflowing into various readership disciplines. It would be a great read for a biologist, educator, or someone simply interested in science. Lane, if feel, reaches several audiences immediately as bullet points make interesting mitochondrial information available for the general public - for example - when it is stated that 10% of an average humans body weight is comprised of mitochondria, but also gets into depth when addressing mtDNA and the functions of the mitochondria.I have a couple of books looking at the mitochondria, and organelle that is now under the microscope of the international community, and this book is one of the best for a non-specialist with deep interests in cell biology and a readable text. It is very detailed, but novel like.If you are looking for literature on the Mitochondria (or Cell Biology/Histology) it is hard to find better than this as a general easy and informative read."
2,This video is dull...,"I love step aerobics, but part of what makes it fun is good music to keep you moving and motivated. I couldn't get into this video because the music was boring. Instead of using stuff off the radio, they used this generic music which, although the tempo was good, I just couldn't get into. I also felt that the choreography was boring and advanced steppers will tire of monotonous moves."
1,Not the best but certainly the least!,"This is my first Shannon Drake book and I totally dislike it, first of all I am a history buff, but Ms. Drake writes in the HR category not History, but this book can be consider a history book minus some details, I bought this book with the intentions of reading a Historical Romance novel but end up reading more about William Wallace, who I respect and love for what he believe in but that not what I expect. Ms Drake writes more about Wallace and his fights and the battle than of the romance between two people, sorry but I feel that this book was a waste of money on my part. And I advise readers not to buy this book if you are looking for a romance book to curl up at the fire with!!!!!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money !!!,"I have read many Shannon Drake books and this was the only one I can say that I did not enjoy. The story line moved very slow. I found the story to be borring and was constantly skipping over parts just to get through it. There was way to much history explained in the book (William Wallace and the war) which I found to take away from the characters and plot line. Not one of her best. Pass on this one and invest your money in one of her better books like Brave the Wind,Knight of Fire,Come the Morning etc."
5,Excellent Read,This was a really fun book to read because it takes a few twists and turns that you really don't expect. The love that develops between Brenden and Elenor is the best part of the story. I also love the fact that Elenor is such a strong charater even though she is a woman. Wonderful story.
3,less nylon than advertised,I order some of these socks and was disappointed to find out they have only 14% nylon not the 27% advertised. Otherwise seem to be a good sock.
3,"Gorgeous photograhs, but too small","The photographs in this book are beautiful and really give the reader a good feeling for Venice. However, the size of the book (something that I did not notice before purchasing) is only 6"" x 6"". Becuase of this small size, the photographs are not given their true justice. This book would be so much more effective if in coffee table size."
1,Disappointing,"Very disappointing. The beats are not enjoyable, to me; and tends to get ""boring"". Also, there is hardly any words to the song."
5,Highland Bagpipes by Pipe Major Jim Drury,I am a beginning piper and have a nice collection of pipe music. Pipe Major Drury's CD is especially helpful as it is mostly solo. Other CDs smother the piping with accompanyment and it is hard for a begginer to follow the pipes. Of course I find myself feeling inadequate when I make a mistake His work is excellent and my playing still causes dogs to bite their masters.
4,An Unusual Take on Peckinpah,"Savage Cinema surprised me. Usually, books on Peckinpah focus on his relationship with the Western genre and put The Wild Bunch as his chief accomplishment.Savage Cinema, however, looks at Peckinpah's relationship with violence and focuses instead on Straw Dogs, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. Ride the High Country and Major Dundee are barely mentioned, and Stephen Prince viewed The Wild Bunch as something that Peckinpah had grown past in these three later films.The result was a book that viewed Peckinpah through a fresh set of eyes, instead of one that plowed over the same ground. I found the book very fascinating and convincing. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that Prince's chapter on the use of montage became hard for me to follow. But apart from that, this is a very interesting book that shows how Peckinpah was a major filmmaker and different from the ""ultraviolence"" of today's cinema."
3,Thought-Provoking and Meticulous,"This book tells in great detail the relationship of violence in Sam Peckinpaugh's films and it's predecessors today. While I would recommend it to Peckingpaugh fans, critically-minded and socially-aware Hollywood types, and for academic purposes, this book is a little lengthy and tedious for those seeking a quick and easy read. Thought-provoking and meticulous."
4,too many pieces to the puzzle?,"I loved this book even though it was not my favorite in the series (those would be 3 & especially #5!). The biggest flaw I found was that there are too many threads and I am not sure that they weave a coherent tapestry. I just felt that I wanted more to the many story lines, more substance, more description, and felt somewhat like the plot was being hurried along. I know Erickson can do better and as a devoted fan I hope the next few books return to the intricate and well written level of thought and detail that the earlier novels had."
5,Short but sweet,"As the prelude to one of the best on-going fantasy series, Malazan Book of the Fallen, this book sets the stage to a unique world. Although the book is only about 120 pages long it still captures the imagination. This is a one night read, but the story will haunt your dreams for a year. A must read!"
2,Beauty Fades,"This product was nice, but somewhat disappointing in two ways. There's a line of serger stitching right across the arm of the slipcover, which wouldn't look that bad except it's only on one side. The second thing is that some of the stitches popped the second time I tried putting it on my loveseat."
2,disappointing,This cover is NOT red. Garnet or a light burgandy.Have already donated it to Goodwill.
2,big let down,"I have this cover in burgandy. It is good to take off and wash, but it hangs ugly and doesn't stay tucked in. It is more work than I hoped for and was a big let down. I suggest a stretchy cover that hugs the furniture for a more sophisticated and tidy look."
5,Book Review,One of the most compelling books I have read in a long time. Great read-- I highly recommend this book.
4,Pretty good bargain,"Has a decent variety of tattoos, but the majority seemed to be retro tattoos. Does have some amazing japanese pieces though."
3,1000 Tattoo's,"Great number of tattoo pictures, black and white as well as color, in this small book. Very interesting to flip through. Only problem with this book is that there are so many pictures that the binding can not handle them all."
4,"Very cool book, but some shortcomings...","I really enjoy this book and never get tired of perusing it, but it is very heavy on old school designs with very little modern stuff to chew on. I love the old tattoo photos from the early 20th century, and a lot of the black and white shots of oldies like Les Skuse at work. A great photographic history, indeed.Again, the only real shortcoming is the lack of modern designs, but it makes up for it with all of the great old school photos. A great resource to have as a compliment to other books and manuals."
5,The Best Book On Tattoos Ever!,"I am a big fan of Tattoos, I have many Tattoos myself, and this book is a great recource on the wide world of tatoos."
2,"Historically, this is very interesting, but. . .","This book lacks a lot. First, it does not address many of the pre-eminent tattooists of the recent past and present. For example, there is no Guy Aitchison, no Aaron Cain, no Dan Hazelton, etc. People like this have been essential to the recent developments of the tattoo. Second, as one of the reviewers below notes, there is not much in the way of written history here. That is both good and bad since it is nice to have all these pictures, but I found my self wanting explanations and background. Third, many of the photos in this book are downright unpleasant in the aesthetic sense. In other words, they depict awful tattoos on people that I don't really want to see naked. I know this is part of the history, but I don't really need to see a close up some guy's private parts tattooed with a devil head. I'm not a prude, but I certainly prefer the more stylish pictures that many of the tattoo magazines offer (especially International Tattoo Art)."
4,Everything from origins to modern,"A great photographic chronicle of tattoos, from the tradition moko of the Maori to modern-style American design. Very comprehensive coverage of different eras, styles, artists, etc., with text that explains the photos without trying to be stupidly hip. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the history of skin art."
3,"Not a bad resource, but not everything I wanted...","First of all, this book DOES give a bit of the fascinating background of tattooing through the ages. It also DOES give plenty of photographs (~90-95% of the book).However, it does not give much in the way of explanation of where the modern styles developed. It also spends the majority of its pages on ""Old School"" flash, opting to only show modern tattoos in the last 5-10% of the book. Also, MANY of the photographs are in black and white, so you can't get a good feel for the use of color on a lot of them.All in all, this is a good resource. It shows a lot of tattoos, but information-wise, it's a little thin."
2,Small Book with large letters,"Contains quotes from the coach. Small book. Entertaining reading, but not very long. About fifteen minutes worth of reading, Not worth nine dollars."
1,Pray it works...,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
1,Class action anyone?,"Actually, This product deserves zero stars, but it seems the minimun is 1.QPS-Inc apparently does not actually have tech support. They do not acknowledge emails past the initial brush off. They do not answer the phone (and YOU pay for being on hold).My drive worked OK for a while but a month or 2 ago started dying. It can read but cannot write. I tried reformatting etc to make sure there wasn't some weird software issue. My drive was and still is under warranty but I can't get it fixed by them. What a waste of 270 dollars. And on a student budget, that hurts."
1,Don't buy it and not from BeachAudio,"I ordered it through Amazon.com and got it from BeachAudio. After I opened the box, I noticed the remote control was missing. And the overall build quality is very bad. But at least I hooked it up to be able to see it works, even though left side picture is distorted (I cannot say it is the monitor or dvd player's problem yet).I contacted Beachaudio for return but received no response at all. I don't recommend this product and don't recommend BeachAudio as a vendor at all."
2,Press release with a few tutorials,"This book should be offered as a throw-in by Boris as it expends more words praising the program than actually teaching how to use it. Some features of the software have useful and informative tutorials, i.e. splines and masking, but others, such as motion tracking have only a press-release type blurb and are useless. The author writes well, just not enough about things that count. Don't buy unless you can look through it and see if it covers the topics you need."
2,Boris the bore,"Technically good book, but Boris is not intuitive, so I would have preferred a book with lots of examples on what the amazing Boris does and how to achieve the effect, rather than to sit down and wade through the interface, the preferences, open GL etc. Perhaps I should have watched someone doing it on a DVD instead."
1,If I Could Give This No Stars I Would Have,"The description of this book says, ""Documentation and training materials have been notoriously lacking for these applications"" and this book continues with that tradition. I pre-ordered this book thinking I could add some advanced graphics to my video projects for school (Vegas 5 and Boris Graffiti) - Boy, was I wrong! This book is nothing but an expanded description of features offered by BORIS. It does not provide whatsoever any insight to instructing you on how to use this product effectively, or teach you techniques that can help WOW your targeted audience. You're better off going to the BORIS web site and reading what it has to offer. In fact you can download their PDF manuals directly and gain more knowledge. Do not waste your money! I know - I learned the hard way![....]"
2,Frommer's Yellowstone & Grand Teton National Parks,From the tourist guide I would rather expect more maps and pictures ilustrating places.
4,Valuable Reference for Your Trip Planning,"My spouse and I just returned from a week in Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. This book was our primary reference for planning our trip and making additional decisions about what to do when there. We found it very useful for both aspects. Some of our personal favorites among those suggested by the the author were: Mount Washburn day hike (Ystone), forest fire exhibit at Visitor's Center at Grant Village (Ystone), staying at Old Faithful Inn overlooking geyser basin (Ystone), staying at Lake Yellowstone Hotel (Ystone), Inspiration Point day hike (GTetons), and using High Country Flies (Jackson) for a day long fly fishing trip. You may need additonal maps from other sources as this is probably the one area of the book that could be improved. However, if you are looking for a condensed reference book written by someone who knows what they are talking about, invest in this book."
3,Good reference book,This was one of many books I purhased for our first trip to Yellowstone and this was good for a general overview.
2,Mattress is wrinkle and too soft,"The mattress has lots of wrinkle on one side and all the four corners. Also, the mattress is too soft."
2,Encased in crinkly vinyl,"Mattress is encased in a rather thick layer of vinyl (with PVC) that is hard and crinkly. Doesn't seem very comfortable, not to mention a questionable choice of plastic for infant bedding. If you're concerned about off-gassing, this probably is not a good choice. I wish I had known more about PVC before I bought my baby supplies. Cheap mattress made with cheap materials."
3,Great mattress for the first year,"My son is now 21 months and has been using this mattress since birth. He is a heavy lad and that has shown on the wear and tear of the mattress. It is in pristine condition except for the saggy-ness.We're about to buy him another mattress because there is no way that this one will last him throughout his toddler years as well and our cot is one of the ones that converts to a toddler bed.We won't buy another one of these mattresses because I don't think it will support my son's weight well.So, in summary, this was an excellent mattress for about 16 months and then started sagging badly. I think that's just about acceptable for the current price of about $60, but since I paid about $99 in 2009, I am not particularly rapt in the purchase."
3,super light weight and flimsy feeling,"This mattress came free with crib purchase for me, or I would never have bought it. super light weight and flimsy feeling. Baby hasn't arrived yet - will see how it goes once she has, but may be replacing this mattress it just seems too flimsy to me."
3,"Fits DaVinci Emily, medium quality","We bought this mattress for the DaVinci Emily.It fits very snugly. The mattress itself is medium tolow quality. It has no springs. It is covered in a plastic package whichresults in a loud ""crinkle"" sound whenever you touch it or the baby moves on it.Except for the snug fit, I would not recommend it."
2,"A little Small for the Emily 4-in-1, Seemed like poor quality","It was a little small for the Davinci Emily 4-in-1 crib (I had ample space to move my hand around between the mattress and the crib). I feel the quality just wasn't there as well. It is a foam mattress which tend to fail and create gaps between the mattress and the crib. Given the price tag, I would have expected it to be a much better quality. I returned this for the Serta Perfect Sleeper. The Serta mattress has a 30 year warranty for the same price vs. the MDB 5 year limited warranty. I plan on this mattress being used for several children and to be used once the Emily is converted into a toddler bed, so I wanted a better warranty, and a higher quality mattress that fit correctly in the crib and would last."
4,Can't beat it for the price,The mattress is firm and our baby is happy. With regular flipping this mattress will last you a long time.
5,"Nice mattress, great value!","This mattress was reccomended by the retailer for our Babyletto Mercer crib. It is a slightly smaller crib, and theis matress fits perfect. No gaps and wasn't a tight fit either, as if it were made specifically for our model of crib."
3,No complaints,The grand baby has not complained. I don't know how you know whether you have a good one or not. I'll ask when she is older.Jim
1,Sorry Mattress,THIS MATTRESS FITS SNUGLY INTO THE DaVINCI CRIB AND APPEARS TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR THE BABY. WOULD RECOMMEND IT.UPDATE:So sorry if I misled anyone into buying this mattress as this has turned out to be one sorry mattress. I purchased this mattress June of 2009. It is now Jan. 2011 and this mattress is sagging horribly over to one end. It appeares all the batting has gone to one end and the other end is about 2-3 inches thick. I paid $99.00 from amazon. See it is now $69.00. As a baby mattress it is worth zilch. DO NOT BUY THIS MATTRESS FOR YOUR PRECIOUS BABY.
1,Horrible mattress,within 3 months it is con caved where baby sleeps. very low quality. im not mad because i got it free with bed purchase. a trash bag full of leaves is a better mattress
2,"Fits the Da Vinci Emily crib, perfectly, but doesn't hold up to light use.","We've had this crib and mattress for about a year now. My 16 month old has slept on the mattress for about a month now and one side of it is flat. We have her crib converted to a toddler bed and the mattress is now lower than the toddler railing is. I'm not sure if that's where she sleeps for the most part, or what, but I'm getting a new mattress here soon. It is also very loud when I lay her down, it sounds like she's laying on plastic bags. I've never had a mattress sound like that, not even the super cheap one from Walmart that we had for my oldest.If you're going to get a mattress, get a Sealy. My middle daughter has one that was one of my friends' who's daughter is almost 6 and the thing is almost brand new. It's been slept on much much more than the Twilight mattress has and it's still holding up very well. It's the Sealy Baby Ultra Rest one."
4,Snug fit,"We purchased this mattress for the Davinci Emily crib. I was concerned because I had read some reviews of the Emily crib indicating that some mattresses do not fit snugly enough. We ordered this mattress based on granny mae's review that it fit snugly. It certainly does! We were very pleased with the fit.I want to give Amazon kudos for the packaging. It arrived in a nice box and was double sealed inside the box in two airtight plastic bags. The box and the packaging were dirty (warehouse storage perhaps?) but the mattress itself was clean. My wife also ordered this via Prime next day, and it showed up right on schedule."
5,Very nice mattress,I am so happy with my purchase. This is so good. My baby sleeps so nicely on this crib. They send a card board with this mattress. Don't throw that. You can keep mattress on this cardboard int0 he crib.
5,Very satisfied!,"The mattress came quicker than expected, perfect condition, exactly as described, and is perfect for the the crib ordered as well."
2,Good for Grandma's house,"I ordered the Da Vinci crib, which is still backordered, and got the free mattress to go with it, so I figured, even if it is crap (which it appears to be) it was free. I will be using this as the mattress my baby will sleep on when we visit the grandparents.Compared to the Serta mattress I have for home this mattress is way too squishy; it does not feel very supportive, so it will be great for the occasional sleep.Oh and when it was delivered, it was just in a plastic bag, no box, so who knows what could have been placed on it while in the truck."
2,Does not withstand regular use,We purchased this mattress a little over two years ago for the Emily Crib by DaVinci. The mattress developed slits in the surface that comes into contact with the crib a few months ago. We are expecting our second child any day now and will have to purchase a new mattress when he is ready to transition to the crib.
2,Falling apart at the seams...,We HAD to purchase this mattress b/c it is the only one that fits the DaVinci crib. We have been using it for almost a year and it is already coming apart at the seams. Thread everywhere. I love the crib but would not recommend the mattress at all.
1,Does not fit davinci Emily crib..,I bought the davinci mattress to go with our davinci Emily crib. The mattress is too small for the crib. I can put my entire arm between the mattress and the crib and my daughter got her arm and foot stuck down the side last night. I suggest purchasing a more snugly fit mattress.
3,So that's how they got to be that way!,"If you love Easy Rawlins, you'll want to read this 'prequel' of the series. In this one he and Mouse, best buddies since forever, are barely twenty. Lots of action, lots of local color (Houston and rural east Texas)."
3,a marginal prequel to the Easy Rollins series,"This is a more serious book than the others in the Easy Rollins series. It is as much about race relations than the coming of age of the two main characters. After all their adventures in Pariah and all their efforts to get the things they want, the white lady who owns the land the town is on and all the land the blacks farm dies and the relatives come wipe out the town and disperse the entire population."
3,A Brief Psych into Why They Are the Way They Area,"I'd have to agree with a lot of what I've heard, while this is not Mosley at his best, this short novel gives us insight into why Rawlins is so faithful to Mouse, and why Mouse is so faithful to his gun.An easy read, it may be wise to reader's who haven't read any of the Rawlins stories, to start with this one first."
2,The Bottom of the Pile of Mosley Books,"Fans of Mosley will buy this prequel to the Easy Rawlins / Mouse Alexander stories to find out how their anti-heroes were `made'. This book is liable to disappoint, however. The setting is rural South, not 5th Ward Houston, and the young men seem more chaotic than inchoate. Mouse, however, remains his murderous loyal self and drives the action.Mosley's difficulty lies in portraying the secondary characters of this novel. They fall largely in three buckets - old-style holy roller good, blood evil, and grotesque. The stereotyping of rural blacks is blatant enough that Mosley seems to uphold the prejudices of 1920's redneck bigots. Fortunately he redeems this broad brush on several occasions with jewels of description and language, and a few twists of sympathy for his characters.Not a best effort - worth reading out of the library, but not buying."
3,Provided needed background to the lives of Mouse & Easy,"The general opinion of the circle was this was not his best work. After reading all of Mosley's other literary pieces, this was truly a disappointment. Realizing that this was his first work with respect to Mouse and Easy all is forgiven. The highlight of the book, would be the background knowledge that was offered, especially on Mouse. Why? Beacuse all the other pieces make great references to what took place in Texas. If this is your first Walter Mosley book, and you can get past the smell, you will be alright!!!!"
1,If you are a real 'Easy' fan avoid this one!,"I was very disappointed in this book - the plot is weak and the ties to the past are very stretched and actually repetitive if you have read the other books in this series. There are a lot of weird sub-plots and digressions that serve no purpose other than to hide the fact of how poorly conceived this book is...In fact, this was so bad, that after having read it I went back and re-read 'A little yellow dog' just to remind myself how good Mosely can be when he is really 'on'."
3,great product!,I bought this for my Mom to use for her maltese. She needed it to remove redness around the eyes and it works great. She just sprinkles it over the foos.
5,buttermilk,Having powdered buttermilk available at a moments notice is a necessary addition to any pantry. Easy to store & have available for use in any baking requiring buttermilk.
5,"CLOSED SICILIAN, NICELY DONE","The Closed Sicilian variation (1 e4 c5 2 Nc3 Nc6 g3) is presented with alternate move orders. Part One covers the main line ( 1 e4 c5 2 Nc3 Nc6 3 g3 g6 4 Bg2 Bg7 5 d3 d6 6 f4 e6 7 Nf3 Nge7 8 0-0 0-0). 9th move alternatives are presented in three chapters. Part Two gives sixth move alternatives for white. Part Three involves early deviations - when black plays ...e7-e6 and ...d7-d5. One chapter covers 1 e4 c5 2 g3 for white. Each book chapter ends with a verbal summary and move order summary, along with associated games. 100+ Grandmaster games are used to illustrate the chapter ideas. The games' opening moves are thoughtfully annotated, although lower-rated players (like myself, 1950 USCF) will really have to dig to find ""thematic"" ideas on their own. This book is a Chess Press Opening Guide book, part of their opening series. So, if you own one of their other books, you will know the format. The author, Daniel King, is an English Grandmaster."
1,huh?,"Who is writing these other reviews? This book was put together in a weekend. He has no passion for this variation, and really only selected some games, looked up the variations in some other books, and added some comments. There is no research above and beyond, too bad king, I thought you were better than the eric schillers."
2,Very Hard!,This game is freakin' hard. I mean I'm nine years old and I can't even beat the first level!! Don't buy this game!!
3,what they never told you in school,"The American Revolution, has brought me back to my younger years with history, it is well illustrated and has complete layouts of terrain, it is definatly a good book for anyone who values history."
2,Disappointed,"Saw Tan Towel advertised on HSN and was very excited for a self tanner that looks natural and does not streak. I am fair with freckles and auburn hair and can tan, but now stay out of the sun. I've used this 2 times, and am not happy with the results. On my skin it has more orange than bronze color and looks fake. I'll go back to using L'oreal Sublime, and it's much cheaper."
4,facial usage mostly,"Tantowel works fine. Easy to apply via the towetets, plus can cut towels up to do smaller areas.Only negative, similar to but not as bad as my previous experience with liquid bottled lotion, DO STILL GET SOME DISCOLORATION OF HAIR. But this is easier to control with towelets than lotion.....unklmilty"
2,Best self-tanner I have found.,"I have tried many self-tanning products over the years and the tan towels far exceed everything else I have tried. They really make you look tan if you get a little real sun, shower, and then use the tan towel. I have all my sisters and daughters using them. All of us are sold."
4,return user,"This product is especially great on arms and legs. It gives a true tan color. I have to be more careful on my face, so I use less of it for facial use."
5,Tan towels,Good product. Easier than creams or lotions. Not messy. Pretty even tanning. A little expensive but will last awhile. Would buy again.
2,TanTowel,Was not really pleased with this product. I gave it away. My friend likes them though. It didn't work very good on me.
1,"If there were only a ""zero stars"" option","I must agree with the other reviewer. I purchased this before amazon offered the option to listen to tracks before purchase. Had I listened to any of them, I would have not purchased this product.I really wonder why lucasfilm hasn't gone after these guys with a legal team."
4,"Good, but . . .","I've read quite a few of these compilations. While there are some really great pieces included--my favorite is the one on TB--it doesn't have the same spark as some of the other books of this type. Nevertheless, it's well worth reading."
4,Pretty good,"This is an excellent collection of scientific writings. It exposes you to fields that you might not think about exploring on your own. The dark secrets of organ donor science and the nightmare of being ""locked in"" by total paralysis come to mind. Note that not every writing in this collection will interest you. There will surely be a story or two that you end up just skipping over due to complete lack of interest. This book is a great alternative to watching T.V. on the nights when you are completely burned out from your primary research/occupation but feel like you need to keep on chugging.Note: I gave this book a 4 out of 5. This is because most of the writings where excellent and very engaging but there were a few that were a little lackluster."
1,Not exactly happy with product,"This blade does not shave as well as the old blade, which is almost 50 years old. I had broken a couple of teeth on the old one and was happy I could replace it. However, the new one does not hold a candle to the old one."
5,Best money I ever spent!,"I rarely buy things over the internet,but I just could'nt find the right clipper blades for a good price.Then I tryed Amzon.com and not only did I find what I wanted, it was also a great price!I will definitely buy with Amazon again."
2,No refills,"The item itself is fine, but it quickly turns useless without refills. Although advertised by the seller, they are unavailable."
1,doesn't worth the price,although i didn't use the product yet but the price is waaaaaaaaay more than the other prices. maybe they should give it a second thoughtpeace all
4,Pretty good if you like strategy card games,"I used to have this game before my brother broke it. I liked it and I was on the last level.( It is not a one day finish game unless you play it for 24 hours straight.) I am trying to look for this game everywhere. Looks like I will have to get it from the internet. The bad things are that you need two memory cards in order to play two player mode, and second, I have a PS2. But I've heard some PS1 games work. I love this game. How about you?"
5,Favorite Childhood Game,"I played this game all the time when I was younger. This was seriously one of my favorite games! I'd play for hours and hours. The game managed to capture me, and I spent so much time trying to beat the bosses. This was one of my favorites on the Playstation! I loved it!"
4,This is a great Game to buy,"Digimon Card Battle is a great game to buy if you like card battle games. It has great gameplay, Cool battle graphics, Great cards, an its lots of fun!The game should not be rated T 13, the only thing it has other than playing cards is characters fighting!!!Some help if you are going to buy it, always put your partners in the deck.So if you like Digimon games, this is a must have!"
5,An entertaining classic for all,"When our son was only a few months old, we began reading picture books and story books to him. The Clever Carpenter was one of them, and as he reached his second birthday, he requested we read it over, and over, and over, and over... and over! It teaches perseverence, creativity, against gossiping and that not everyone sees the same thing the same way -- that there are many ways to come up with a solution to a problem or need. A sweet book with lovely illustrations showing how happy the children at Principal Peter's school were with the loop and a swoop slide and how proud Samuel Plank was to have built what he envisioned, which, of course, is a specialty of his!"
1,dissapointed,seller sent me a four score from another country and its not compatible here in the U.S. there was no regional description to know what i was getting (said it works). here i sit nearly $20 in the hole and a useless item... i work 60 hours a week the last thing i have time for is rectifying screwups/scams like this.
4,It took 20 years to hear this!,"Who can explain what goes through the mind of a record exec? As Burton's liner notes explain, this album was quashed for US release in 1980. What a shame, but this release is now our gain! Can anyone explain how a song as beautiful as Heavenly Blue could be ignored? Or the snappy horn solo-ed Fine State of Affairs? This follow up to Dream Of a Child just seems to grow on you with repeated plays...One and Only, another gorgeous ballad, has Cummings signature all over it, along with the album closer Wakin' Up Today. With a host of band and studio buddies, including Jeff Baxter on guitars, Lenny Castro on percussion and Jim Horn on sax, this collections fills a big gap for us US fans...It should never have been shelved...listen and see why!"
3,So much potential...,"I happened upon this little known/reviewed movie and saw the good reviews on Amazon - figured I'd watch. Elvis & Anabelle is a weird, twisted sort of love story. It's hardly your traditional, ""Notebook"" love. But it certainly plays to the classic romance cliche of not judging a book by its cover.With a father that suffers from memory loss and a happenstance, posthumous burial of a beauty queen, Elvis (the lead) kisses the the girl and she comes alive. In this magical realism, ala Sleeping Beauty, she awakens. With her second life, Anabelle searches for herself and finds Elvis as an intriguing companion.With deeply moving scenes about death and suicide, this movie had such potential to balance reality and magic. Instead, the movie was incredibly average and nearly became Romeo & Juliet towards the end. Solid B flick."
5,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!,"We happened upon this movie on a ""chick-flick"" channel, not expecting too much. It stars one of my favorite actors, Joe Mantegna, so we tuned in to check it out. What a gem! My entire family and I got hooked from the very beginning, and were mesmerized until the end. The male lead, Max Minghella, was absolutely charming and we could not take our eyes off of the screen when he was in the shot. The entire cast was excellent, as was the directing. I am still thinking about this unique and extremely well-done movie. I highly recommend it."
4,Overall a good phone that has some setbacks,"This is a awesome phone. I have a bluetooh equipped laptop and I can use it to download and upload files to the phone. It's bad that this phone is not widely available in the U.S.When I got this phone, all I had to do to make it work was just put in my sim card from my old phone and go through the setup menu on the phone and that was it.Pros.Download files through bluetooth connection.Plays mp3's.Ring tones - use mp3's.Browse though phone memory and memory stick with PC.Speaker phone - Good playback sound for mp3's.ConsCamera needs a lens cover. Can accidentally touch when normally using the phone.Battery life could be better.USB cable for phone can make the phone USB connection loose.Same phone port used for power and USB port.*When buying this phone unlocked, make sure you call your mobile phone carrier to see if the phone will work on their network.*"
4,Michael Jackson: The Life And Times Of The King Of Pop 1958 - 2009,"I have watch this, it was good in ways. I enjoy the footage of MJ and the fans who adorn him."
4,sad video,the video is awesome but it made me cry alot cause im saddened for the los of michael jackson still need to get more of his videos he is a legend i will never forget im in my 60s but i love him alot u dont have to be young to love him ill be a fan forever
1,Life and times of the King of Pop,Don't bother buying this. I was very dissappointed. All it is is just news fotage and the ceremony of his death. We all have seen this before. Nothing special.
3,Was alright,"This was ok and at least I have it to add to my collection. However, it was mostly just alot of clips on fans and clippings here and there. I've seen much better but didn't cost much and glad I watched it."
1,A Disgrace!,"This product was more than a ripoff, it was a disgrace to Michael Jackson and his memory. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS AWFUL PRODUCT. I could not believe that this product would be sold on Amazon! This was a bad home movie that doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. Less than professional people put together a product that fooled the public and charged money for it...and it reminded me of a thief taking your purse. I am amazed that Amazon would be co-conspirators as selling this was criminal. Nothing is sacred any more."
3,The Life & Times Of A King Of PoP,"It In General, Was A Compilation Of Videos Of Michael As A Youngster & As An Adult, However Brief A Life It Was.The DVD CD Itself Skipped In Places, Got Stuck {Froze} & Was Basically A 3.5 Rating I Give It Out Of A 1 to 10 Scale Rating Graph."
2,"Not impressed, don't waste your money if you want professional quality work like the mags and publishers.","If your serious about professional quality cross-stitch images, don't get this one, it's strictly amatuer hour for this software. Personal pics don't come out as well as what they advertise on the box. And if you are not software savvy there is no directions or decent tutorial. Don't waste you money or time, you get what you pay for."
5,Canonical text on ethics,"The underlying text of this commentary is a deeply inspired canon on ethics. This work is as groundbreaking as the New Testament but is born from an eastern perspective. It is hard to understand that this text is so little known in the west. I would rate this, along with the Sermon on the Mount and the Tao and Kant's categorical imperative, as one of the definitive works on ethics and spirtual insight. Part of the commentary is colored by Buddhist beliefs which I personally substract from its general message (as I would with Christian dogma from the New Testament)."
3,"Not Completely Convincing, But Still Well-Done.","""Killer: A Journal Of Murder"" is not as deep as itpretends to be. It doesn't really dwelve into the mind of a killerlike other movies. But it's still pretty interesting and the viewer never really wants to stop watching it. The heart of the film is intriguing: A young gaurd is fascinated by the perverse and dark life of the most dangerous man in the prison. The screenplay is vicious and gritty (even a nice librarian gets raped) and the characters though not perfect, are still well-written to a certain extent. I wasn't riveted, but I was interested and it did make me think for a while. This is more about the lure of evil and it's mechanics and maybe even redemption. Not a masterpiece, but still a good film."
1,Sox Sux!,"Don't know what everyone is talking about: these sox sux! I started wearing thorlo socks decades ago. Loved them for their thick cushion and they lasted forever. Truly stood alone for quality. Don't know if they changed factories or what, but this is no longer true. I'm constantly throwing away singles with holes on the sole. I contacted the company who told me to use fabric softener and had a host of other explanations. Beware."
1,Beware this scam,"The writer of this book has 47 complaints against his comapny from the Better Business Bureau. If you call them for info, they immediately go into a hard sell sales pitch promising to hook you up with bartending jobs worldwide."
3,QPS Que! M3 External 80 GB Firewire Drive,"My Que! M3 external firewire drive works just fine with Macs, and it works well also with Windows XP as long as you don't have XP Service Pack 2 installed. I could not get it to work with my computer at first (with SP2 installed); when we reformatted my computer and did not install SP2, it worked just fine.I also had the same issues as the first reviewer when trying to contact the company. I used my cell phone to make phone calls, but I think they were returned only once, so the company does not have good customer service from both of our experiences."
1,Really bad.,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
3,Lacking in Maps and Hotel Information,"I found this a well written book that captured the feel of Puerto Vallarta and helpul for dining, shopping and background information. However the maps were inadequate and the hotel information very skimpy. I realise that it is a compact book but it should have a couple of detailed one or two page maps of the entire area showing road names. Unfortunately there are no maps in print to supplement the tiny vague maps in this book."
4,An interesting blues vocalist...,"Not to controdict other review, but Blanche Callaway was not the 1st female leader of an all male band(remember Mamie Smith & Her Jazz Hounds with the 1920 hit ""Crazy Blues"") Mamie Smith had her jazz hounds from 1920 to through the late 20's. Anyhow this is a very interesting CD which features some pleasant but rough vocals by Blanche Calloway(older sister of Cab). Blanche Calloaway is actually more famous for managing 1950's R&B singer Ruth Brown's career. Still jazz and blues collectors should get this CD for some good blues singing, and for the musicians(Louis Armstrong being one of them) in her hot band."
5,Excellent CD of Blanche Calloway's recordings.,"This Chronogical Classics CD has the best and largest collection of Blanche Calloway's recordings available. Blanche Calloway was the first female bandleader of an all-male band. Like her younger brother Cab Calloway, Blanche was a high-energy performer with a compelling vocal style. She was rougher and wilder than Cab, and her subject matter was raunchier than Cab's tended to be. She is one of our favorite jazz/blues vocalists/bandleaders. She has such a powerful presence that when we play this CD, we feel as if she is right there in the room with us.Blanche deserves more recognition than she gets! This CD includes excellent liner notes and a couple of beautiful photographs of Blanche. It also happens to include the earliest recordings of Ben Webster. You can find more Blanche Calloway and also more Billy Massey (her male vocalist) on the Andy Kirk (1929-1931) Chronogical Classics CD."
1,Buy something else!,"The CD is sang by 3 different women who disguise their voices so they sound like babies. It's horrible! For most songs, they sing out of tune, sometimes flat and sometimes sharp, with poor annunciation and very annoying fake voices. One of them sounds like a deranged version of Elmo. My son is 2.5 years old and doesn't get particularly excited when I play it. I have to grit my teeth to get through the CD."
1,Misleading DVD Cover...,"MAYHEM MOTEL is NOT a horror movie. It's a low-budget series of disjointed events occuring in various motel rooms. Each scenario is more perverse (not that that's necessarily a bad thing), ridiculous, and non-sensical than the last. I think some of it was meant to be humorous (all of it?), but it comes off as just plain idiotic. I kept waiting for it to gel or make some sort of sense. Any comparisons to a David Lynch film are ludicrous! Lynch can be bizarre, even outrageously ambiguous, but he's never boring or imbecilic! Yeccch! Luckily, this bomb is also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES..."
5,Please see my earlier review,"Amazon has obviously not yet found this book for me. I suppose it's hard to find. If you knowwhere I can get a copy of this book, please e-mail me: finkel@hawk.ucc.edu. To theperson who e-mailed me concerning this book:if you have any information on the public school system in San Diego, please e-mail that to me.I've still got some space here... uh...uh..I'dlike to thank so many people for bringing me tothis point. Firstly, I'd like to thank God. Secondly I'd like to thank Mamie Eisenhower, Richard Speck and the Pied Piper of Hamlin. Gooo Piedy"
4,Loaded with useful info,"Extremely handy, even many years after it was written. Sections on the Higgs in the SM, MSSM, fat Higgs, 2 Higgs doublet models, etc., including excellent and thorough tabulation of decay rates, Feynman rules, and a lot more that I haven't needed."
3,Not the same outback,"Please note that this isn't the classic Aussie film released in the US as ""Outback"". That film is actually ""Wake in Fright"" and available in Region 4 format in a newly discovered print (it was essentially lost for a long time), and is one of the greatest films from that country ever (Donald Pleasance gives one of his most deliciously depraved performances). I don't know this film and the stars are arbitrary, Amazon not giving us the option to not rate."
5,Childhood sentiment,"I got this book from my mother when I was 16, that's more than 40 years ago, and it has been with me and my children ever since. I played the songs on the piano, on the guitar, and with the accordion, and I know them all by heart, including the lively and colorful illustrations !The arrangements are really good and easy to play.Every year with Christmas I play the songs, and I wouldn't miss this book for the world. If you like singing and playing, order this book, you and your kids will love it !!"
1,Documentation of the obvious,"The bulk of the book is devoted to describing the Registry entries controlled by the Control Panel interfaces and other applets. Approximately 25% of the volume is a raw dump of a NT registry. If you are looking for how to enable command completion in a DOS window, or other interesting tidbits, this is not the book.One of the few books I've ever found so useless that I've bothered to return it -- fortunately, Amazon.com makes returns quite painless."
2,Doesn't have what a professional developer needs... Sorry !,"Having read the rave reviews on amazon.com, I purchased this book hoping to find all sorts of interesting information on manipulating the registry programatically. (In particular I have an interest in user accounts and NT security in my current application.) Whilst I'm sure the book is an invaluable source of information for some (hence the two stars, not just one), I personally found that it contained little that wasn't either already obvious to the developer, or that couldn't be found elsewhere fairly easily.For me - something to consume shelf space, and little more."
1,rsvp endurance bulb baster,the first time I washed the end that the injector screws into fell out. Would not buy from rsvp again
3,Good for the basics,Good for beginners. I was looking for information to help me as a parent get to know the sport better. There was 1 very helpful page. The rest of the book is for a beginning wrestler.
4,Been here before,Excellent collection of songs by former Klaatu songwriter/guitarist. Space rock/pop with great guitar playing!
4,Funny ass indie comedy!!!!,"in th e day when too many w\were studio donkeyn boys....these nguys did it. they made a tight story, good characters, a baking queens nightmare of wonder. Watch this movie, they're fantastic!!!!!"
3,Item was nice. Vendor sent wrong size,As a huge Giants fan myself I couldn't resist buying a fellow Giants fan and soon to be father a gift for his newborn son. This giants baby towel was perfect except the vendor sent me the wrong size. I returned the item and was forced to buy something locally due to a time crunch. Unfortunate.
4,One of the Better Non-Neros,"Stout really hit his stride with the Nero Wolfe mysteries-- they're head and shoulders above almost anything else in the genre. And they tower above his other work and other detectives (Tecumseh Fox, Dol Bonner, Alphabet Hicks). But some of his other mysteries are well worth reading, and this is one of them. There's no ""name detective"" this time, just some dogged protagonists out to dig up the truth about murders new and old. ""The Mountain Cat Murders"" takes place in Cody, Wyoming, and starts slow, but revs up nicely by its midpoint. It's a bit humorless when judged by the Wolfe series, but the mystery is a good one and the payoff is worth the wait. I'd place this toward the top of Stout's non-Nero Wolfe output."
5,Beautiful story- beautiful writing,"I was very moved by this story that followed the lives of these interesting, connected women. I was fascinated by the non-linear way they were related- the way it was woven together, and the manner the main character was kept at the center of the story. I think this book is a must-read for 6th grade girls and above, its appeal to boys is questionable, although I think there is hope! The historical detail is rich, the themes of finding family and being true to yourself are well explored. This is one of my favorites!"
4,NELS13 SNOWBLOND,"GOOD GAME- SOMETHING LIKE AREA 51 AND SPLINTER CELL WITH MORE SAVE POINTS. WOULD LKE A LIST OF MORE GAMES LIKE IT.THANK YOU,TOM NELSON"
2,why don't stores cary this game!?!?!?!,I looked everywhere for this game. I've even seen it advertised in the newspaper and the games no where to be found. Why?? I can order it online but why dont the stores carry this game??
3,Average Shooter Compared To Other Games,"This ain't a bad game, but it is subpar when compared to Doom 3, Riddick, Far Cry, Swat4, Brothers-in-Arms and Half-life2. Don't get me wrong, its a fun game. It just doesn't compare to other new shooters out there. I even like Area 51 better than this, and these graphics remind me of games 2 years ago. Wait for F.E.A.R. coming out in October, or get one of the other games mentioned earlier. The only upside to this game is the budget price of $10 you can get it out, but thats because its a disappointment like Pariah. It just doesnt deliver the punch that these other games do."
3,"OK game, there are better","The game has a weak story line and it doesn't allow saves at any time, so I ended-up replaying the same scenario, until I got bored and deleted the game off my computer."
3,Fun but old,Its a fun game but the main problem is that its too old. There is rarely anyone playing it online. The single player mode is pretty fun but thats about it.
3,Not bad,"Look out! You've been stripped of the WWE title and Stephanie McMahon has been kidnapped! (and who cares?) So you must get her back (unfortunately)which will also return the championship belt to your possession (the things superstars go through for that damn thing...)Playing as The Rock,Stone Cold(What?),Triple H,or the Undertaker, you'll battle through this action/adventure game,THQ's first WWF GBC title. Featuring a ton of vicious weapons and nasty moves, the game's 6 levels will take wrestling out of the ring and into the streets."
5,Gabriel Du Pre is the best,"Peter Bowen writes with a wonderful style and, best of all, his characters speak in the dialect of their culture. Takes a bit of getting used to, but he's always entertaining. As far as I know, I've read all his ""Du Pre"" books... Just wish he'd finish another pretty soon!"
3,Great Book,"This book is old, but still readable. Most people don't know this author. She wrote great stories about real people."
3,"Great deal, but threads catch easily","This was an awesome deal. I couldn't believe the number of pieces I got, for so little money. The color is a gorgeous golden shade, highly recommended. Only catch is that it catches *very* easily onto things (even your fingernails!) But I use it under a down comforter, so since this one isn't on top, you can't really tell that the threads have caught & pulled. Very pretty. Pillows are great and comfy. Curtains are thick and nicely decorative."
1,The Seller is a SCAMMER!,This seller is selling their products under FALSE pretenses...what you order is NOT what you get. Stay away from this Seller.
4,Hidden Treasure!!!!,"This CD has fallen into my ""strong songs"" category. The music is very mellow and relaxing."
5,Sultry Soulful Soothing Sounds,"This youg lady has mastered the soul-filled art of story telling. Her lyrics vividly capture a moment in time that becomes priceless. Rhythm, melody, drama it's all there. Let her music be the soundtrack to a unforgettable memory in your life!"
5,Awesome Pills,It helps my eye sight and my body. My eye doctor likes me to use them every day of the week.
5,ICaps Great,How do I write a view on Vitamin unless I take them for a few monthes. The service was great and hopefully my eyes will not worsen and improve.
1,Ignores America's vested interest in oppression,"Reding does a good job discussing human rights abuses and the struggle for democracy in Mexico. But he does a terrible job of discussing the underlying cause: U.S. foreign policy. America's self-interest in a ""stable"" Mexico meant unquestioning support for the murderous PRI. If the U.S. were really really interested in democracy in Mexico, it would have supported the students in 1968 -- when the Mexican Army opened fire killing hundreds. Why did the U.S. close rank with a murderous government and turn its back on the democratic hopes of the Mexican people? Because the PRI promised stability -- through oppressing human rights, through frustrating democracy. Reding turns a blind eye to our complicity in prolonging the road to democracy by three decades. Reding ignores American culpability in the ability of the Mexican state to oppress its own people. Shameful book."
3,Interesting CD -- No PSB vocals,I'm a big PSB fan so had to have this CD. Its good -- has the true PSB sound -- but no Neil Tenant vocals. If you are a big fan -- you should buy it. If you are an admirer of Neil's vocals only -- take a pass.
3,A Shallow Look at the Defenses of Pearl Harbor,"The harbor was believed to be too shallow for torpedo bombers and this book makes it seem like the Marianas Trench. Some good pictures and maps and a lot of the history of coastal defense works, but little depth in the actual integrated defenses of the island -- of which the Pearl Harbor defenses were key elements. When in high school, I have walked many of the installations when they were more accessible than today (development takes its toll) but had neither the information nor the time -- more important a lack of commitment -- to really understand the Fortress-Oahu concept. 50 years later I'm still looking and this book has helped very little."
3,Not Quite What I Was Hoping For...,"Just a brief comment. As a small business owner, I was needing to set-up a small LAN network within my office between three computers. While this is an excellent book for networking concepts...its not what I hoped.I had hopes that it would also address common software applications, such as Microsoft Windows XP, as many of us out thre are using that software for small business networking. Well.....not a word.So, while I gained conceptual knowledge in the book, I gained very little practical application. I returned the book. I hope, should you purchase it, that you are pursuing only the basic network design, and not software application help."
5,Great introductory book.,This is the place to start. When you have time for more reading you can go deeper and read the Switch Book or TCP/IP Illustrated.
4,Good,Was poor as a kidd and could knot uhfford a sund card for dooke nukum. 3d sound kicks ass ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Good card for the money-- exceeds expectations,I bought this card based on heliumcarbide's review and found it to be a good card for the money. In fact it has many options that I will never use. I would have paid the low price for just an old fashioned ISA sound card.
3,The second of this series satisfies,"Although not truly inspiring, the book remains consistant with the first one where our hero attempts saving another group of aliens against the malicious company.Also of interest, we find out more about the mysterious ghost ships, and exactly what the luck stone is.I had to keep putting the book down after 50 pages or so to get a break from it. Otherwise, this one definitely is a keeper for star drive fans."
4,Very Good Album...,"Very good album, I like the spanish greatest hits album ""La Historia"" a little better. If you only know english, this album will be great for you. If you are equally fluent on both english and spanish than ""La Historia"" will be the better choice."
1,Dont buy this game,"When i went to the game store looking for a game that would be fun to play i made the mistake of buying this game. The game was so bad, it didnt use the GBA great potencial, it would have been great for GBC. And the game is so long and with no password. 120 levels with no batery or password was enoughj to stop playing from the first time."
1,Why?,"My dad bought this for my girlfriend. I have no idea why. I gave him a specific list of games she would like and he comes out with ""Tang Tang."" I don't have words for this thing. It's absolute horror. You're some kind of deranged power-ranger alien robot or something. You can make blocks appear to try and attain some unknown goal as you get crystals and jump around a little room avoiding random bad things. I got to the boss. It's pretty ridiculous. I think my brain blocked it out because it's like a giant cow or dog. I don't remember. Don't find out. Stay away from this thing."
4,like a classic,this game is alot like solomons key for nes which most people probly never heard of. you somon blocks to jump on and to block spinning enemies. it's a really unique game.
5,Very informative!,"Just when you thought you knew what God required of you! This book was a good read and should be read by all who profess Christ. While being filled with the Holy Spirit is a hot topic amongst the different sects of Christians, Kenneth Hagin makes it quite clear that speaking in tongues is for all Christians!! If you are not sure or you need scripture references, read the book! Highly recommended!"
3,The Kobayashi Report,I really love this game. However I would prefer playing the version on the PC. But this has a few different details that are not in the PC version. Slightly improved graphics is the main thing as well as Half-Life Decay.
5,Half-Life,"This version of Sierra's Game Of The Year is excellent. The Graphics are sharp,clear,and they are more fun to look at.Buy it and try it for your self, but don't take it for my words."
3,"Not bad, but 25 identical levels gets repetitive.","Half Life is a pretty decent game, BUT... every level is exactly the same, there are only about 5 different weapons, and about 5 different bad guys. Not the excitement or variety you'd expect from PS2. It just keeps going and going and going, no cut scenes or change ups."
3,Three stars for bad sound,"I'm really shocked at the use of 8-bit audio for all the in-game dialogue. It's jarring; it pulls you out of the experience. This is the sort of thing they did in the old NES days and I don't think it's justified anymore.Given the same technology other companies have managed to put together games that look AND sound good, and frankly Half-Life is neither.Luckily it plays well or we'd have a surprising stinker on hand here."
1,This game sucked,It took way to long to get going and it made weird sounds at you. it also had a number of homosexual references. i did not like it. neither should you. unless you only have a half of a life. losers
2,Don't buy Half-Life!,"I would not buy PS2 HL because HL is set up for the PC. It would not be the same and it only costs (some bucks) for the PC version or you can the Platinum Pack for (twice as much) which also has HL:OpFor, TFC and C-Strike. I have never played HL for PS2, but im sure that it could never beat the PC version. The original PC version is the best game out there."
4,good fps but ive played better,"this game has a pretty cool story line. i have to say the single player mode kept me busy for hours. it is a very long game!!!!!! cool weapons, cool scenery, and cool aliens!!!!! i must say that the multi player and co-op modes ar extremly horrible!! the co-opmode is only fun to play by yourself. if you are looking for a good multi player game i woul suggest Agent Under Fire."
2,Good for the PC but theres better on PS2,Do not waste your money. This game gives little fun and has no online play. Although the guns look cool there is not that many. The graphcis are pretty bad too. The coropative Decay is a total waste of time. The locking on system is (...bad). Every time you see an enemy you must press circle to lock on. Speaking of enemies they are also (...bad). You fight the same stupid looking enemies over and over with the same guns. The multiplayer is horrible. You can only face one opponent and no computers at all. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
4,A Classic that is Largely Successful on PS2.,3 1/2 out of 4 starsPros: Great cinematic first-person experience with clever set-pieces and in-game moments; well-designed puzzles that make you think; long campaign with good pacing and moody atmosphere.Cons: Doesn't look as good as other FPS' on the system; frame-rate stutters frequently; slightly finicky controls.
3,Better on the PC,"If you've played this game on the PC, I don't recommend playing it on the PS2. Although it looks nice, the controls are so difficult. This isn't a game that should have been brought out for the PS2. The game itself is one of the best, only on a PC though."
3,"Great one-player mode, multiplayer is horrible",I had a great time fighting off aliens and soldiers because of the nice story ... but the multiplayer looks so rushed its like they let a bunch of monkeys work on it. I had no fun at all fighting my friends in this... get unreal tournament instead for a good multiplayer fragfest.
4,Good but Extremely Hard to Beat,"I have Never Played this game on the computer but i've seen my best friend play it Several Times. My friend was really good at the game but told me that it was Extremely Hard to beat, only later did i realize what he meant by this. At the last level there is a huge alien that is Impossible to Kill. I don't think I know anyone that can get past the last level. Don't get me Wrong I think that half-life has great graphics and awesome gameplay but I don't think Anyone should get their hopes up about beating this game."
1,Oh Boy,"This is goin to be fun. Half-Life is without a doubt the worst video game I have every played in my lifetime and that's saying something. I beat the first four levels in the game and then I honestly couldn't take it anymore. The story is ...not well planned, the monsters are dumb and kill you easily, the characters and graphics are bad, really bad, and finally, the whole set up is just plain [bad]. The multiplayer is no better with rooms the size of a small box and the weapons [are not good] too. I mean, the crowbar is the best thing to use. When a gun isn't good enough to kill people in a first person shooter, you know you've got problems. Please save yourself and don't buy this game. I'm so glad I borrowed it from my friend instead of buying it. Heed my words fellow video gamers, Half-Life is terrible"
1,Game of the Year...Ha!,"I bought a Half Life and add-on pack because of all the hype surrounding HL. You would think being Game of the Year would mean that its actually good. Ha!, not the word i would use.Maybe i am too much into realism in my games, real weapons, real people etc, but I thought HL was ^&#^*. I would not recommend Half Life and i can't understand why it was so popular."
1,NO WAY...,"Half life is my favorite game... I loved playing counterstrike, Day of Defeat and many of itz other mods... I spent countless hours in internet cafes playing till dawn... however i am dissapointd that a game which is meant to be a multiplayer game is made for single player... i have played the single player mode on my computer, but a Playstaion2 game???!!! First there is no multiplayer.... and i think that reason is enough... half life is game for multiplayers a PS2 version destroyed this game..."
1,very disapointing,"this game is one of the worst. how it got high 8s or even 9s: i got no idea. the graphics are very squarey and the mouth movement of the people has that ""dark cloud"" look. explosions look flat and weak. the framerate is smooth while walking but rough while running. pretty realistic, except that when you so much as tap a person with a crowbar they break apart into steaks, as if they were hit by a granade or something. a few things can be demolished. this game has a very small selection of monsters. i believe even ""doom"" for the game boy advance has a wider variety. there is a whole lotta weapons though. i haven't yet beaten this game and i problably will never get bored enough to try. the only reason someone should buy this game is to destroy it, and make the world a better place."
4,probably going to one of the best games on the PS2.,"This has got to be one of the best games on the PC right now and i cant wait until it comes out on the PS2 but the only down side about these games on consoles is the cotrols thats why I gave it four stars But but other than that it still an excellent game. When I first saw this game at my cousins house it was the coolest game I have ever seen I mean it has a great story line, good graphics, and massive worlds and on the PS2 its going to be great cause you can play 1-4 players and you dont have to buy four PCs to play the game with all of your friends and that's a major + any way I just cant wait for this awesome game to come out on the PS2."
4,"Sweet, smooth silence","This swing was a belated Mother's day gift to my mother. I passed on other models in stores because they were too big for the space it would occupy in my garden or too squeaky when in use. I decided to take a chance on this one and am glad I did. The swing set was delivered within a week and I assembled within three hours with only the help of my cats (would've been quicker if I didn't suffer a momentary brain-freeze while attaching the arms to the seat.) It operates smoothly and silently with no hitches. The wood is a lovely honey color though a bit tacky from whatever it's been treated with. The reason the swing doesn't rate a ""5"" in my estimation is because a few pieces of the wood were dented in transit. Also, I found the canopy material somewhat flimsy and the directions for constructing the canopy not entirely clear. These complaints are small relative to the great pleasure that the swing provides to my mother and to me."
5,Mr. McCants rides ut again!,"This book is awe, you wouldn't want to put down the book. You'll be clapping hands for Becca's intelligence on advising fot teens"
1,Inappropriate,"Here is a quote from the book ""So you had sex with him?...Last Wednesday, after midnight...I was a virgin, so it hurt real bad at first..."" This book is too much. I just stopped reading it and got rid of it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"This is very poorly designed product, extremely user-unfriendly. The PC connection has to be snapped so tight till it almost breaks to make a connection. Buttons are very small. I have tiny fingers but still have trouble setting to the right mode and if you are not careful, you could be digital video-recording which takes all the memory in 1 minute instead of taking the pictures. The pics are very poor quality and DARK!!! DO NOT BUY this product, just buy a real digital camera or buy a real digital video recorder."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"This is not an MP3 player. To listen to music on it you have to use some stupid conversion software. Personally I think their is a great class action lawsuit for false advertising on this. In the meantime I putting this POS on ebay, and vowing never to buy another Panasonic product again."
3,Where is the second volume?,"Originally published in two volumes, this is a translation of Volume I, which contains all the text. All of the musical examples and graphical analyses (without which, Volume I is of little use) are in Volume II. Volume II is in print and available from the publisher, but does not seem to be listed here."
4,Somewhat Disappointing,"Unlike many other works of P D James,this one is slow moving,probably becauseDalgliesh is not in charge of the investigation.It is also somewhat unrealistic(even for fiction),as 7 women have been murdered at night,and women are stillgoing outside alone after the sun sets. The discovery of the main murderer seemsto have occured with little police input (it's a wonder the local ""cop"" wasnot superceeded by an outsider).The technical production is good,except I domiss not having Closed Captioning (British sound/pronunciation takes somecareful listening at times. Also,a spell out of the character names would havebeen helpful). All this said,this DVD set is worth viewing and my remarks shouldbe considered along with more positive ones,such as those of ""Mr Jim""."
5,"A classic, sweet, and witty tale","Tender, thoughtful, and with an exciting ending, ""Caleb and Kate"" is a book about loyalty, valor, and maybe even what it means to be married! At least that was my take on it. :-)"
1,stationed in italy,"I am currently stationed in Italy and I am taking Italian lessons through an Italian instructor. She advised me not to get this book because it has alot of words that are misspelled. Other than that the book is okay. But when you are learning a new language it is important to be able to pronounce them correctly. One letter off could mean something different for example casa is house, cassa is case or box, and caso is chance."
1,Poor choice!,"This is a poor choice for any concievable use. I have found it to lack appropriate translations and gives no aid in specifics of pronunciation. It is very minimalist, and seldom useful. I am going to try the Webster's next."
4,Glitch on Disc 2?,Has anyone else noticed a glitch on Season 2 Disc 2 on the first episode? The episode will not play from the beginning; it skips ahead a few minutes?? Looks like a firmware upgrade will be needed.
3,"Great show, HORRIBLE Blu-ray","I love this show, it deserves all the praise it gets. However, the blu-ray is painfully slow and forces you to skip over ads for bleach and season 3 everytime you load the disc. I don't have the newest blu-ray player but this disc takes, by far, the longest to load of any blu-ray I have every played in two years. Also, the menus are slow and unresponsive, making them difficult to navigate.Surely such a great show deserves better."
5,"Great show, poor quality blu-ray","The show is great. I can't say anything that hasn't already been noted about how excellent it is.I do want to weigh in on the blu-ray, however, and second some of the problems other reviewers have encountered. The discs are quite difficult to navigate and the quality of the menus is poor. It takes ages for the episodes to load, the bookmark function is cumbersome, and the time it takes to even get to the main menu is ridiculous. It was frustrating to wait five+ minutes just to get to the point of choosing an episode. I also had problems with the main menu on each disc loading correctly - it skipped and stalled, and then the menu was jumbled. This is on a new Samsung blu-ray player - it's fully updated and I haven't had a problem on any other disc I've tried, even from Netflix.Summary: great show, the blu-ray isn't worth it."
5,what can i say??,"the only thing i don't like about this show is that the 1st season i never watched it.. saw two episodes at the end of the 2nd season that drew me in.. now i have seen them straight through from season one to present.. this is one of the best television shows ever!! clever.. smart.. funny,, dark.. i mean.. its got it all.. i love to watch movies but rarely find a television show i can/want to get into.. A+++!!"
2,Just started watching,We have only watched the first two episodes of season 1 and it is really boring. Will watch the rest of the season and see.
