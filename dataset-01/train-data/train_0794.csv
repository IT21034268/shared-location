4,"IF YOU LIKE ""WHO DONE ITS"" YOU WON'T PUT IT DOWN!","Second in the series of heroine Nina Reilly as a reluctant criminal justice attorney. Fast paced, yet with sufficient background of the characters, to allow you to read without prior books. I have read both ""Motion to Suppress"" and ""Invasion of Privacy in paperback, have now ordered both with the latest,""Obstruction of Justice"" in hardback. These sisters join my hardcover author's Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum, Arthur Haily, Michael Crichton, John Grisham, William J. Caunitz and Clive Cussler on my book shelf. You will know ""who done it"" in the last few pages, I dare you to guess."
4,Female attorney does it again!,"This makes the second novel involving this sort ofburnt to a crisp female attorney. She's had somehard knocks lately, has decided to stay away fromhomicide defenses, when this nice, safe invasionof privacy suit lands in her lap. Suffice to saythat it soon turns into a situation bigger thanNina ever expected to handle. Suddenly the woman she isdefending turns into a harridan,knows a lot about her, is messing into her private life,stalking her son, and damaging her already injuredreputation. Her faithfulsidekick investigative detective uncovers some informationthat Nina would rather nobody know. All of a sudden she'sdefending a murderer, much to her chagrin, one that isas close to her as her own son. Great read. What a tangleof interwoven lives in this novel. Might stretch credibilitya little, but then again, what escapist fiction doesn't??"
3,Quick Review,"When a client of attorney Nina Reilly is murdered, the prime suspect is a man she had long hoped she'd never see again. Going against her own promise, Nina decides to defend the man when all evidence (including a video of the woman's dying words) points towards his guilt.This was much better than I had anticipated it would be. Enough turns and surprises to keep the reader guessing untill the very end. Interesting array of characters and somewhat believable dialog and interaction. A very good legal thriller"
1,This is not an electonica album - Don't buy this album for the Pussy Remix,I bought this album because it was in a related search for Lords of Acid; and somehow they connected. this is rap house music. I dont like that style. This album might be good for others; but this is no way related or connected to Lords of Acid electronica music. Just my opinion. Great album cover though...
5,Bought for my grandmother,"I bought this for my 85 year old grandmother for her to use on a regular basis, and after getting in touch with her and getting her to finally answer my question about the camera, she told me that it worked and she's happy with it. She hasn't had any problems with it and finds it easy to use and load and handle. She likes the features, the zoom, and it isn't complicated or bulky like some of the film cameras can be. It fits in her purse and she likes the red eye reducer and finds it durable."
2,not love at all,"My wife and I watched this film with high expectations. This couple did not fall in love -- they fell in love with falling in love. Sadly, many many people don't know the difference, and this couple never figured it out, either. Read chapter 3 of THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES by Gary Chapman (taken from M. Scott Peck THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED) which plainly and clearly explains what ""falling in love"" really is; Chapman's book will do more for your romantic and love life than watching this movie."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A romantic movie whose romance is so understated it's almost not even there (even the movie's stars didn't get why their characters *mild spoiler* don't have sex), Brief Encounter may appeal to minimalists but it sure would be a lot more interesting if something actually happened; aside from the inspired black and white photography there's little to recommend about this slow and dated romance."
2,Archaic Romanticism,"An incredibly dated film burdened by archaic social and sexual mores, major overacting and a generalized lack of tension. A bored wife having an affair was perhaps a really big deal in 1945, and her accompanying guilt is played and replayed much longer than necessary. Additionally, there didn't seem to be very much physical or emotional chemistry between the two co-stars. In fact, the bantering and humor of the tertiary characters in the train station's coffee shop was much more entertaining."
5,Brief Encounter Goes the Distance,"This is my favorite movie in the world. I have seen it many times over the years and it never disappoints. Watching the DVD is an especially delightful experience on my 22"" Apple LCD monitor because I have the opportunity to see shadow detail, characters, and all kinds of other surprise elements that were never visible in a theater or with a VCR viewed on a soft television screen. The story is beautiful, the acting wonderful, the writing brilliant. Celia Johnson will break your heart, Trevor Howard will too.The film takes place in England in a sweet, simpler time. Love however, is never simple. Noel Coward's marvelous sceenplay, David Lean's spectacular directorial debut, the marvelous Eileen Joyce playing the Rachmaninoff score throughout. You will not be disappointed in this treasure."
4,Memorable film but expensive DVD,"With all the detailed and erudite reviews of this famous film, let me merely comment that since it was released in 2000, there have been many DVDs released of many classics at a much lower price. Many of them offer much more than Criterion do here. Sure, you do get a very good but not perfect restored print and a useful and interesting commentary but on even the most assembly line Hollywood product, that is almost standard now.""Brief Encounter"" is an exquisite film with an overwhelming performance of heart-rending poignancy from Celia Johnson and delicate sensitivity from Trevor Howard but the Criterion package is still too expensive."
5,Perfect,"One of the best film romances I've ever seen. I cannot praise this movie enough! The music, the acting, the plotline... all brilliant."
5,An adult movie without the embarrassment,"The subject is temptation. The affair begins innocently enough, but escalates to something that threatens to destroy two families. The suburban housewife played perfectly by Celia Johnson does the right thing when she realizes what she was about to lose. There is passion without profanity or nudity, and in the end, everybody does the right thing. I think we could all learn from this movie."
5,An age of innocence,"Well before Adrian Lyne's morality tales about adultery came this David Lean non-epic that didn't burst, early into the film, with sexual aggression. Rather, that subtle pain of nervous tension, between adults who are attracted to each other but who are not allowed to act on it, is brought to life in an age of innocence and rules.Lean's style is stylistic in subtle doses (we can neither forget the atmosphere of the train station, nor the tilting camera when suicide almost happens). It is a compact, Lean (pun intended) narrative that had to be, immediately upon completion, an eternal masterpiece.This Criterion Collection DVD bears an excellent transfer; it must have coincided with the new print I saw at the American Film Institute National Theater in Washington. However, unlike most Criterion DVDs, there is very little in the nature of extras, other than a commentary track and a brief description of the restoration process. (That is to say, no documentary.)"
2,Poorly assembled pastiche,"This is a weak effort. Interesting and sometimes compelling editorial for each decade (generally essays by agency principals), which has absolutely no relationship to the samples of work shown. The work itself is never glossed, explained, or explored in the larger context of its time frame. The selection of work included is spotty. Reproduction quality is poor, especially on the broadcast material, with many spots featuring only a couple of keyframes and omitting large amounts of dialogue (to the point where the spot makes no sense). Skip this book and look for a used copy of ""When Advertising Tried Harder."""
1,Low resolution and bad color balance for a DVD,"I noticed that the resolution was poor, color was washed, and I was totally disappointed. Most shots have corner blocked, as if the images were shot from a hole (maybe to cut out wind sound?). I was watching this in a 17"" monitor (brand new LCD that can play widescreen format), and already could tell the poor quality. If you watch this in any bigger and better monitor, your frustration will only magnify.This DVD seemed like a mere transfer from a VHS tape, and should be treated as ""VHS quality video in DVD format.""Anyone who only knows the latest, prettiest Hollywood DVD titles, stay away with this one. You will be amazed with the poor quality. Those who never experienced real DVD, this may be a relaxing one to watch on a poor quality 10-year old TV."
3,A tape to fall asleep to,"I guess it's just what it claims to be, but a single view of an ocean of waves just didn't cut it for me. Granted each ""chapter"" includes another island, another view, but it's still just waves (like I should have expected more?). The sound is good and I tend to prefer closing my eyes when relaxing, so it works in that way. Maybe you could use it at your next Hawaiian Luau party combined with a Hawiian music CD."
1,Not what you would expect,I was very unsatisfied with this DVD. The picture quality is very bad and the sound really does not even come close to the real deal. I have purcahsed other relaxation DVDs and this one is by far the worst. I wouldn't recomend wasting your money on this one.
2,Pardon the Interruption,"Nice premise. Too bad the serenidy is interrupted with advertisements for their webpage, telling you what day it is of your vacation, and other graphics. The cliff views were not too impressive either. I lived in Hawaii twice and they could have picked some better beaches."
1,disappointed,"I really can't review this product because it was never sent to me. I ordered Hawaiian Dreams and received some Carribean Beaches DVD that I did not order. My Hawaiian dvd was on back order so I was shipped the other instead. How can you assume that i would want this Carribean DVD. It was suppose to be a Christmas gift for friends who enjoy Hawaii tremendously. How do you think they would like to see the carribean instead. I'm thinking NOT !! I really have no use for this Carribean DVD but I seem to be stuck with a purchase that I absolutely don't want. I would appreciate if Amazon would please send me the DVD I purchased and send a prepaid shipping envelope so I can send this one back to you. This was my second experience shopping on line with Amazon.com and depending on how this issue is delt with will tell wether I will be shopping again. Thank You, Miss Natalie Maddalena"
2,A Disappointment,"I don't know what I was expecting, but this was hardly what I'd call a virtual vacation."
2,disappointed buyer,"I should have listened to the people who gave this one or two stars. The sound of the waves sounded more like constant white noise. The subtleties of waves and ocean sounds were lost; there was very little of the ebb and flow which is evident on the real beach. After visiting many beaches on Kauai, I was disappointed by the choices given here. Even with our large-screen TV and great sound system, this was NOT a virtual relaxing vacation. The constant interruption of the ads destroyed the serenity they were aiming for."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this, based mainly on the reviews I read here on Amazon, for my impending trip to Hawaii. I was really disappointed and wish I hand't purchased it at all, maybe I am a victim of hype. If you are looking for basically STILL pictures and sounds of the ocean by all means buy it. But don't expect this in any way to indentify specific places on the islands or teach you anything about the islands. Also the cinematography left something to be desired as well, fuzzy pictures (not DVD quality by ANY means). I have an audiophile grade sound system and the sound is not 5.1, or even pro-logic for that matter. Who knows, maybe I will appreciate it more upon return from Hawaii (if I return) but for now I would say don't waste your money on this video."
5,Very nice bag,This is a great bag with a gazillion compartments. It has a back strap (backpack style) and shoulder strap. It's lightweight and very functional.
5,Stud finder,"This thing actually works, and readily finds the stud edges so I know where to drill for installation of shelves and tool hangers. It was offered at a great price."
5,Great!,"The product was exactly as advertised, at an unbeatable price, and was shipped immediately and received in perfect condition.Thank You!"
2,Looking for a challenge? Look somewhere else,"I use this video when I meant to exercise all day but didn't have time, and I'm too stressed for a real workout. Hilary does a decent job of winding me down at night, but this isn't challenging work at all. In fact, if I do this, I feel like I've cheated. I'd never done a Pilates workout before, so I thought I should buy the ""basics,"" but this is so basic a toddler could do it. (Slight exaggeration.) I've read a lot about Pilates, and it's not supposed to be a breeze. It's supposed to really work your core. This tape doesn't. I replaced this one with Karen Voigt's Pilates DVD, which is the tough core-strength workout I was looking for."
3,Not that good,"They kind of pass over important events. Like Soviet involvement in Korea, Vietnam. They also fail to show that if such a ""monster"" moves, reacts, launches initiative to conquer, it is in reaction toward another ""monters"" move.They fail to show the ""why""'s of Soviets international decisions. This is because they solely focus on Russia, which is useless for a documentary about Russia. They HAVE to explain US & NATO moves also so we understand a little bit better the whole picture.Nonetheless, this documentary still hold some interesting information about former CCCP, but presented in some boring way because of the above issue.Documentary was out in 1990, so don't expect to get a present picture of Russia and it's ex-sattelites."
5,An inspirational must-have video for women climbers,"The one and only climbing video about women. Reveals the connection between overcoming the obstacles of climbing and overcoming the obstacles of real life. Views the lives of five women climbers: Roxanna Brock, Tiffany Levin Campbell, Stephanie Forte, Brandi Mulligan and Beth Rodden. A beautifully created real-life mini documentary of 5 woman climbers who's lives have forever been changed by one of the most extreme adrenaline sports, Rock Climbing. Whether you desire to rock climb, or to go outside of your comfort zone to experience something you've always dreamed of, this DVD will inspire you on every level possible. Featuring the first female ascents of Lurking Fear 5.13c, Soul Train 5.14a, and Cholos V9. A must have for ALL woman!"
1,Boring!,"I tried, I really tried to get into this book. I made it more than half way and decided I didn't care who pulled all these hoaxes. It was so bad, I removed all the other Innes books from my shopping cart."
1,Iomega external16x10x40 usb,"I had to take this machine back to the store because it was to difficult to operate. The hotburn software was difficult to navigate. Trying to make a music cd with individual song were impossible. My computer kept locking up when trying use device and hardware. lastly, this thing kept losing my data; when I tried to retreive my data it wasn't there. Bottom Line too many problems. I am now trying out QPS Que Fire 24x10x40 cd-rw external. Good Luck people"
3,Go carefully Mac Users,"This item works fine most of the time. The included software includes a note telling Mac users to download Mac software from Iomega's web site (where you'll find a charge for it). A call to their customer service quickly answered my questions (and the gentleman was very helpful). There is no current software for the Mac, but the Toast Lite ""should work."" With only occasional freezing of our machine, we have found it's a fine back up when it does work and look forward to Iomega sending us software when it's available."
2,Warning stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I hooked up the drive to my lap top and it installed but my usb controller would not read it. I tried every single thing I even tried hooking it up to my freinds computer and the same thing occured I contacted iomega support and their information that they told me did not work. I thought this drive was plug and play but in fact its plug and struggle. I gave it 2 stars because it looks nice.
2,The driver cannot work with my HP photosmart printer,"I am not sure if the problem is in the driver of my HP's photosmart printer or the driver of the Iomega RW drive.My printer is working fine before I install the CD drive software. After I install CD RW driver, my PC canNOT come out of window 2000. I cannot even uninstall my printer's driver unless I uninstall the CD drive software first.I have called both HP and Iomega support, but they just ask me try all kind of things. At the end nothing will not and they believe it is my PC's USB controller problem (Yes, right!)I have to return the CD RW drive.If you have a HP printer, you may run into the same problem."
3,sleak looking,this sleak looking external cd burner is great if you don't have any more space in your pc. took me a while to figure out that you need to have it plugged directly into your pc and not a usb hub. still having little problems but it is fun to make music cds.
2,Does not play well with XP Pr,"First off, let me say this device worked perfectly on Windows 2000 Pro. Installation was a BREEZE and I was cooking at 16x write speeds. However, after installing XP Pro, the drive no longer worked with my USB 2.0 card, and worked only very sluggishly on my USB 1.1 port.Iomega's chat support, while friendly, is of little help with the techs very slow to respond and recommending the same fixes every time. Email support is slow and mind-numbingly ineffecient, and don't try to call phone support unless you plan on spending 30-45 mins in queue (on their non-800# line).All this to say, if you have XP, Iomega isn't ready for it yet. Perhaps in a while after they released more patches/upgrade they will be - but as of now, I'm returning this unit."
1,bad piece of hardware,I thought this was going to be a good product but it does nothing but eat cds and spit them out. I had the product for a year and only made 1 cd of proably about 25 before I gave up. It would never work with my new thinkpad and xp and technical support was horrible. Tech support kept telling me to turn off things in the background that typically are running in any windows operating system etc. I got an old fart who kept explaining to me that he had been ding this for 30 years instead of getting the product to work. I sent product back and got rembursed. I won't buy any of this company's products again because this was such a headache.
5,AWESOME TUMMY TIME TOY!!!!,"My baby doesn't do well with tummy time. But with the help of this toy, he will tolerate playing on his tummy. He LOVES to look at himself. He coo's at the mirror; like he is talking to another baby. He even likes to play with this while he is sitting up.This is a wonderful toy at a wonderful price."
5,Thank you!!!,"Until we bought this toy, our son hated tummy time. He'd cry and fuss making tummy time an agonizing obligation. We needed help! As soon as we bought this turtle, he lifted his head to see himself in the mirror and smiled! From that moment on, tummy time was fun time. He's now 4 months old, and he loves it more and more each day. I'm so happy we found this toy!!"
5,Great product!!,"I bought the Tummy-Fun Turtle for my twins when they were about 4 months old. They hated tummy time, so I was looking for something to help them enjoy (or at least tolerate) it for a while. Unlike most baby mirrors, this one is not distorted and they love talking to themselves. They also love the removeable frog rattle, it's loud enough to get their attention, but quiet enough that it doesn't annoy everyone around. I don't think my babies would ever stay on their tummies without this toy."
1,Not too interesting...,I thought this turtle was absolutely adorable and thought it would be perfect to help my daughter spend some extra time on her tummy. She has yet to take any interest in playing with it. The mirror is nice--she does look at herself in that but I would imagine you could find other toys that have mirrors that are more fun and cost less.
4,Tummy Fun Turtle,"My daughter loves looking at herself in the mirror. I have her play with it when she is playing with her Link-a-Doos playmat. The toys from the mat are on one side and I place the mirror on her opposite side. When she looks to her other side, she can see herself in the mirror."
4,"Good Reference for ""Real World"" Programming","My first impression after I purchased this book was that it would have limited usefulness. However, after about two weeks on my first GTK+ project it became clear that it was actually the most useful of three books I had purchased. After having this book for more than a year, it is what I turn to about 85% of the time when I have a GTK+ question. If this book has a weakness it would be that it doesn't mention much about the GNOME desktop. However, for ""real world"" programming on a GTK+ based project that will last more than a couple of weeks or go beyond the basics, this book is a timesaver. I also have the book by Peter Wright that covers GNOME and is a fairly useful supplement to this book."
4,Not bad at all...,"This is a very deep and thurough look at the scavenger lands. The only bad part of it is that it often leave certain things without stats, as in these tombs of former exalted that annhilate their would be thieves...eh,jsut pet piev though. But all in all, if you are interested in this part of the game world, buy it."
5,An Excellent Work,"To start off, let me say that the musical craftsmanship on this album is outstanding. In my opinion, Dave has reached back and rediscovered the intricate, strong style he displayed on his first two albums. Backed by excellent musicians (including an almost unmentioned Phil Keaggy on bass) and fine production values, Wilcox's melodies jump out and take hold of the listener.Lyrically, the album is probably the most spiritual of Dave's work. Many of the songs make allusions or outright references to Dave's continuing journey of faith including the title track, ""If It Wasn't for the Night"" and ""Native Tongue"". There are, however, other ideas explored, including the beauty of a child's view of the world on ""Radio Man"".I recommend this album without reservation. It is an excellent alternative to much of what passes for music as offered by the mainstream music industry."
2,"Good lyrics, music average","This is not David's best album. I am a HUGE fan of the man. The lyric's are better than in his last couple of albums, however the music is well below David's previous standards. Ric Hordinski does a fairly good job with the cool/innovative guitar sounds and arranging, but as on past recordings the sound production is thin and lacking. If you are a Dave fan (especially because of his lyrics) then it's probably ok to buy this album. If you are new to Dave then buy either Big Horizons or How Did You Find Me Here."
3,"not his strongest work, by far","Usually, David's CD's take a few listens to really take hold. Only ""How Did You Find Me Here"" grabbed me from the first song. The music here sounds too familiar. The lyrics...maybe the metaphorical thing has gotten out of hand. Oh, there are a few memorable tracks, but overall, I was disappointed. (and I'm a die-hard DW fan)"
1,Rip off!!,I bought my chi here and I didn't try it for months because I was traveling when it arrived so then I go to turn it on and it didn't heat up. I tried contacting the seller to see if there was anything I could do about it but they never replied back.
1,HORRIBLE VENDOR - DO NOT PURCHASE FROM AMELY BEAUTY STORE,Do NOT purchase any products from AMELY BEAUTY STORE. They have HORRIBLE customer service and ship defective items. I purchased a $140 Chi Flat Iron in November 2010 and in less than 8 months the item stopped working properly and constantly shuts off. I contacted AMELY BEAUTY STORE to find out what could be done as the Chi Flat Iron was still under the one year warranty. None of my emails went answered. This is not how you should run a business and I will never purchase from this vendor again.
1,never received product,"This seems like a quality deal, until you open the box and find nothing in it!! Yea that's right, no Chi flattening iron! After 3 emails, I finally had to write to Amazon and complain and explain situation. I was refunded in full. How do I rate the product? Got no clue! Never saw it ."
5,A Great Find !,"I was happy to find an old favorite - The Knight Moves, DVD arrived in Great time, in Great condition, and for a Great price - So This seller is reliable and a Great find as well. Thank you."
4,An underrated suspence thriller.,"Despite the lack of interest that people have displayed, Knight Moves is quite a good movie. Sure, the psychopath theme is getting a bit worn, but this time the idea has been used in a rather original fashion. The murderer is playing chess with corpses instead of pieces and is framing Christopher Lambert for it. I am not a fan of Lambert, but here he did a good job as the somewhat introvert chess-master, whose lack of openness makes him an ideal target for the frame. The supporting cast, led by Tom Selleck and Diane Lane has well worked out characters and the story moves along at a surprising pace. While not quite on the same level as Silence of the Lambs, Knight Moves will keep its audience thrilled right to the climax."
1,Do you want nightmares?,"If you do, get this movie as nightmares are almost guaranteed. I saw it with some college friends about eight years ago. It took about five years until the nightmares stopped. I cannot think back on this movie with any sort of fondness. The murders are quite gruesome.The only thing that I feel was well done was how the writer seemed to get into the mind of a serial killer, but that also concerns me. My mind just does not think in that sort of mode.While I am not a great player, I like the game of chess. I feel this movie did the game and those who play a really bad stereotype.Avoid this movie. It is not worth the time or stress."
1,The worst PHP book on the market,"I have bought a number of the PHP books around. This one was about the third or fourth that I bought, but it is by far the worst.The few chapters of actual content are quite good, but as people have noted, they have a lot of errors and are often badly edited or presented.The bulk of the book is a function reference. I did not mind the function reference in Core PHP. At least Leon wrote his own examples for functions and added something beyond just stealing from the online manual.In this book, the function reference is just a rip off to bulk up the page count."
4,Great for Postgres but NOT for mySql,"When I began the book I thought ""Oh Wow, this is great"". Unfortunately, all the examples are for Postgres. There are about 15 pages of reference for mySQL and they are a bit cryptic. I had trouble converting the Postgres commands in the examples to their mySQL equivalent. Ultimately, I found that I needed to buy a second book since I was using mySQL. The concept of using their web site for testing is fantastic. I love the style and enthusiasm of the book."
2,Disappointing PHP book,"I agree with other reviewers. This is a disappointing PHP book. For syntax-reference book, you rather go for Core PHP."
1,A Big Disappointment,"This book isn't what I thought it would be. I expected a tutorial that would spend more time on using PHP with a database. In reality it only has eight simple and not very useful examples. The remainder of the book is a reference section which consumes 445 of the 597 pages.And to top it off, the reference section has so many errors that you end up spending more time troubleshooting the book's errors than you do writing good code."
3,Title of book mis-leads,Shame on the publisher for placing a title that implies advanced coverage on a beginners book. A book that has 50% command reference should say so (in the title or on cover). This book has little to do with application development. Not even one real world application is discussed with any detail.The book is well writen and a good first or second book on the subject.
2,PHP3 Reference Misses the Mark,"This book, which opened up with a lot of promise, ended up disappointing me. The title is misleading in that there is very little about what actually has to be done to build a database application. If you are looking to find a book that will take you through the basics of working with server side databases and show you how to construct web pages that will interact with those databases, look elsewhere.More than anything this book is a compendium of the PHP3 command set. The author's website did not work as promised and there was no response to email feedack. In the sparse and rudimentary application section what sample code existed had typos. In the reference section, some examples still had boilerplate filler.In summary, as a reference text this book is more than adequate; as a guide or teaching aid it completely misses the mark."
1,I would return it,"If I am not in Hong Kong, I would return the book. I agree with other reviewers that if you want to learn how to develop real database application using PHP, go somewhere else. The application examples in the book are so piecemeal. I am also disappointed that 2/3 of the book (pp.153-559) is language and function reference. I did not know this when I brough the book from Amazon! You can learn PHP and database programming much better by reading Professional PHP Programming (Jesus Castagnetto et al.) eventhough the book is not specifically written for database development. Their application examples are more realistic and full scale."
2,"Good start, but failed miserably","The book had a good start, starting off with a quick beginner-style intro into databases, but focused mostly on PostgreSQL. It was all downhill from there. There were COUNTLESS typos and syntax problems in the example applications. This book does NOT tell you how to create a good web application. If you already know how to do that in ASP, it tells you how to do it in PHP. If you're not experienced with ASP or any other server-side DB language (cold fusion), and you're looking to get into DB apps on the web w/PHP3 - do NOT buy this book - it will be a waste of your money."
1,Not the book you expect it to be,"I was very disappointed with this purchase, wish I could return it. The book is disorganized, and the code is full of errors."
1,Misrepresented,"This is supposed to be a compliation of all-girl and girl-fronted heavy metal bands, right?Ok, there are tracks from Lacuna Coil, Arch Enemy, Nightwish, and The Gathering, all good female-fronted bands. But the maker of this album must not have paid much attention, because a female duet doesn't make Tiamat a female-fronted band.And they missed quite a few other bands. Where's the track by Otep? Kittie? Tristania, who one of the three vocalists is a woman? How about Evanesence? Within Temptation? Why were these bands overlooked?Methinks that the person who came up with this album was more eager to jump on the bandwagon than to pay attention to the scene."
3,Disappointed Overall,"This music is very nice but overall I find it disappointing considering how much I spent on it. It is just very simple relaxing music. Basically it seems like the same 16 beats or so played over and over again for 18 minutes. It's soothing, but I don't understand why there isn't more to it. Perhaps this is part of the technology?"
5,THE book on covenants for beginners,"As one from a Baptist background who has been in the reformed tradition for a little over a decade, I've struggled to understand all the distinctions of covenant theology. I've studied many of the Reformed theologies and read other books on covenants. This book has finally given me a framework that pulls it all together, and I am blown away by God's grace.O. Palmer Robertson's ""Christ of the Covenants"" may be the classic work on covenant theology, but Horton's is better, in my opinion. Chapter 3, which clearly explains Galatians 4 and Paul's distinction of the Abrahamic covenant from the Mosaic covenant, is alone worth the price of the book. In addition, it has clarified for me so much more regarding various types of covenants in the OT. If you want to understand the importance of covenants (and you do, if you want to understand the Bible better and if you want to understand what grace really means), you must read this."
2,Biblical Perspectives,Somewhat difficult to read and understand. Many words obscure and required the use of a dictionary. If you are not a Biblical educated student if may be challenging to read.
5,Shows Why U2 Is Best Listened To Live,"This album has one of the best live recordings of the song ""Bad"" from the Unforgettable Fire. I really began to appreciate U2 when I started to listen to their live performances. Live at Red Rocks is a better album, just becuase of the impact it had and its timing. But, this is a good buy for any U2 fan."
4,Definitely worth the price,"Buy this EP for the definitive version of Bad. It towers over the version on The Unforgettable Fire album. An absolutely spine-tingling live track. The ""previously unreleased"" songs are also good. Three Sunrises ended up being one of my favorite U2 songs, for the neat harmonies, uplifting hook, and the unexpected meat-grinder guitar breaks from the Edge."
5,"Pricey, but good","Its a good EP if you're willing to pay an above-average price for it. If you like Bad, and you should :), go download Bad from Live Aid. Like others have said, its breath-taking. Also check out Bad from London (with Jeff Shankar I believe, 1993?), and also live from Rattle and Hum. Anyhow, Wide Awake is definitely a worthy EP."
4,This is the record that did it,"Nobody remembers this now but the sparkling live version of ""Bad"" on this EP is the song that transformed U2 from MTV alterna-rock heroes to superstars in America.Seriously, I was in college at the time and this was an era where Journey and Def Leppard were hugely popular. REM, Talking Heads and U2 were plenty popular and sold records but were still pretty much dismissed by the great unwashed masses. In the weeks after this EP came out, you suddenly started hearing this live version of ""Bad"" blasting out of frat houses which would have been unthinkable previously.""The Unforgettable Fire"", which preceded this EP, was a great album and sold well but ""The Joshua Tree"", which was their next studio release after this EP, was a great album that sold in massive numbers. It was this live version of ""Bad"" that set the stage for U2 to take over the world."
4,Best track in U2's entire output - right here...,"The live version of ""Bad"" is my pick for the best thing U2 has ever released. It's an utter revelation, far surpassing the studio version in immediacy and power. The other live track is a worthy version also, much different than the atmospherically-rendered studio version of ""A Sort of Homecoming"", though not necessarily better.The two studio tracks are worthwhile for U2 fans, and are better than some of the songs that actually made it to The Unforgettable Fire album. ""Three Sunrises"" mixes 60-ish psychdelic pop with some more aggressive signature-U2 touches, while the final track ""Love Comes Tumbling"" is a little too mumbly-morose for my taste, but is a nicely crafted song nonetheless."
4,Amazing live versions of two damn good songs,"Thsi is just a mini CD, but it contains the best Live version of ""Bad"" and ""A sort of Homecoming"" that you can find. The drum on ""A sort of homecoming"" is simply amazing. An incredible energy emerge from this song. ""Bad"" is also incredible. The two studio tracks are quite good also."
2,Wide Asleep in America,A waste of time and money for only four song and they no different then you could find on a studio album.
4,Wonderful novel,Another very interesting novel from Asimov. You feel really traveling through time...You can't leave the book aside. Some of the terms used are difficult for non English readers.
4,How to deal with the contradictions of time travel...,"It's always difficult to play with man's ability to travel through time, while you always end up with contradictions you can't explain away. Asimov bypasses this problem more elegantly by isolating the timetravellers from society in a separate environment. That leaves the reader with a pleasant and well written story."
4,The Master Addresses Time Travel,"I suppose that Asimov couldn't ignore the basic sci-fi themes of time travel and alternate realities and here he turns in a respectable novel that makes use of these themes. Not as good as some of other sci-fi works that he published around the same time, such as the robot novels and the (early) Foundation series, nevertheless 'End of Eternity' reflects the signature Asimov writing style: plot twists, scientist-as-hero characterization, and the 'let's stretch this sci-fi concept to it's logical conclusion' story-line (done in his usual playful, tongue in-cheek manner). In other words, it delivers the goods.If you have enjoyed most of the other early works of Asimov, and tire quickly of his later, nostalgia-riding, buck-raking-in 'Foundation's Fridge' period, read this book. It will not disappoint."
3,"Somewhat dated, a little over-the-top","Seeing as the Eternals have access to most time periods of the future, you would think they would have better technologies than micro-film to store books and other information :) Another problem is the relationship between Harlan and Noys... one non-described roll in the sack isn't going to create the deep romantic interest we see presented in the book. I'm a huge Asimov fan, and have read almost all of his SciFi work, and this book, while not a failure, has earned my lowest rating so far."
3,End of Eternity,I thought it was a bit dragged out for Asimov. A lot of repetition of thoughts. very slow read.
3,"Is there Kindle edition really? If not, why?","I love this book. I read translated edition again and again.After I bought a Kindle I tryed to buy Asimov books first, but almost all books has no kindle edition yet, at least in my country.I wish I can buy and read them on my kindle as soon as possible."
4,Brit Pop Psych Freakbeat Fest,"I bought this DVD at the same time as the ""So You Want To be A Rock N Roll Star"" DVD comp, which had similar bands on it, and liked this one better. The reason being:1) The Move performing ""Wild Tiger Woman""=excellent.2) Bonzo Dog Band playing ""I'm The Urban Spaceman"" with Roger Ruskin Spear dressed like a big peppermint drainpipe.3) Not one but two great Small Faces clips, the snappiest dressed band of their time. Love those balloony satin shirts!If you love old British psych music you ought to get this first and then get the ""So You Want To Be..."" disc after that."
3,A book about metrics & statistics but not about call center,"Based on the title I was expecting a lot about call center specific metrics. This is not the case. The focus is on statistics and metrics for tactical purpose (Quality Control Chart) and strategic view (Distribution, standard deviation). If you are familar with QC charts and statistics then the book does not have to offer a lot. For call center metrics it mentions only a few examples like abandonment rate or wait time in some sample. I was looking for an exhaustive list of call center metrics."
2,Not much value,"Reads like a statistics textbook. If you have any background in statistics already, skip this book. It is not terribly helpful."
2,"Fits the lug, but...","Not the lug wrench that came with my 2004 Wrangler. Sizing chart said it would fit, and it did, but cant use the lug nut wrench. So I put them on the spare and will take them off with a pair of pliers I carry. Why didnt I return them? Not worth the hassle for $10."
5,Flawless and sharp,"Excellent durable finish. Be careful not to begin to torque with tire iron all the way to the wheel surface -- with no flange, you'll scratch the wheels. Stop short of the wheel with your wrench/iron. They get compliments and mechanics never lose any... it's too easy to tell they've been replaced with chrome."
4,The melancholy and musical story of two Baroque musicians.,"Quignard tries to do with fiction what history cannot: recreate the life of the mysterious and obscure Baroque musician, Sainte Colombe (who's first name is unknown, even), and the relationship he had with his most famous pupil, Marin Marais. The result is the magical if short novel, ALL THE WORLD'S MORNINGS. Quignard, also an expert on Baroque music, brings to life the pain of the reclusive Colombe, who devotes his life to his music and his solitude after the death of his wife, and the fire of Marais, who's arrogance and brilliance ignite Colombe's anger and his daughter's love. Though the translation is sometimes awkward, this is a unique, beautiful, musical, and deeply moving book"
4,"Lots of names. That's what you wanted, right?","For the standard long list of names in alphabetical order, this book does it well. Girls and boys names are separated into two separate lists, one making up the first half of the book, the other the last half.Just about every name has its meaning and origin listed. Along with it are variations of the name. This was particularly helpful and gave some extra naming ideas.But if you looking for something more inventive or creative, this book is not it. It's just a list of 20,001 names. Don't get me wrong, it does what it does well. But reading a list that long may start to bore you.I'd recommend getting ""Beyond Jennifer & Jason, Madison & Montana"" by Linda Rosenkrantz in addition to this book. This book probably has more names, but the ""Beyond Jennifer & Jason"" book will probably keep you awake, and give you some good ideas. I have both books, and I'm glad I do."
2,Not quite what I expected,"This book turned out to be a disappointing resource. Although the book includes 20,001 names, many are unlikely and outlandish (Klotild, Edwige, Ghislain, Ethelbert, Birtle), making it arduous to sift through to find the names more worthy of consideration."
4,Loads of Information,"This book contains everything you want to know about names. You will find definitions, related names, examples of people with the name and much more. A great resource to have as you make a very important decision!"
4,Pretty Good,"I've never seen any Burt Lancaster movies, until I saw this one. And I was impressed by his portrayal of the famous gunslinging lawman, Wyatt Earp. He does a really good job and beats the bad guys. Kirk Douglass does a good Doc Holiday, who is sick with TB. Lots of action and a really neat gunfight at the end. It shows the realtionship between Earp and Holiday. Though Holiday would never admit it, he was good friends with Wyatt Earp. Pretty good movie with good actors and story. It may not be all accurate. Like some people say Johnny Ringo wasn't at the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Ike Clanton didn't get shot. I want to say that just three of the Clanton gang got shot down, not everybody in the gang. I read somewhere that Billy Clanton and two others got shot. Not the entire gang. Ike Clanton died later. Not that bad though."
5,Classic Western,This is a turning point in western movies which had been pretty predictable up to this point. This one had depth and followed history pretty well with glorious music & scenery. Having made a recent trip thru Tombstone AZ I knew I had to see it again so I bought it and have really enjoyed it.
5,Still a Classic Movie Western,"Though historical innaccurate Gunfight At The OK Coral is still one of the great western movies fifty-plus years after it's initial release. This is pure entertainment --- forget the inaccuracies. Forget that the actors look nothing like their real-life counterparts. Just enjoy a gem. No cursing, no nudity, just class. And enjoy the acting, from the stars such as Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas to the character actors such as DeForrest Kelley and Frank Faylen. FrankieLaine's title song who haunt you, maybe even drive you nuts, but even the song adds to the class of this film. And the DVD quality is about as great as one could ask for. They just don't make them like this anymore."
4,A showcase for Lancaster and Douglas,"Basically, a vehicle to showcase the talents of Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, but an appropriate one. Though there are many characters, this is hardly an ensemble cast, with Burt and Kirk prominent in virtually every foot of film. Rhonda Fleming provides a bit of window dressing in a wonderful but brief role as Wyatt's love interest.More of a classic western than ""My Darling Clementine"", an earlier movie about Wyatt and Doc at the OK Corral, but this version is more episodic in nature, though equally fictional. Don't look for nuance in the characters. The bad guys are bad, the good guys good but not flawless.Gunfights, gambling, galloping horses, bar room ladies... If you love westerns, you'll love this one."
4,A great Western,"Despite its title, this movie does not center around the gunfight at the OK corral. Instead, this is a sort of life of Wyatt Earp, and includes much information about his life in Dodge City as well as Tombstone. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is Earp's developing relationship with Doc Holladay, which is perhaps never treated so well as in this movie.Burt Lancaster, who plays Wyatt Earp, does an exceptional job. And Kirk Douglas, as always, is also very good. Still, I just can't picture these men well dressed, impeccably groomed, and always wearing light colors. I give this movie four stars for the simple reason that I can never think of Doc Holladay again without picturing Val Kilmer. For me at least, the definitive movie about Wyatt and Doc will continue to be the recently made ""Tombstone."" I enjoy this movie immensely, but it just doesn't have the raw power that the later film does."
3,adequate retelling of a much-told tale,"Good performances from Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, especially in the amiable bickering of their scenes together. Amusing early Dennis Hopper/DeForest Kelley sightings, but other than that not much interest from the supporting cast, especially the women. And the random singing of ""The Ballad of Boot Hill"" theme throughout the movie is in my opinion really, really annoying. Overall: better than ""Wyatt Earp,"" not as good as ""High Noon"" or ""Tombstone""."
1,Comical and horrible misresentation of the Gunfight,"This film was made far too late in history for it to be so replete with comical errors.One would presume the ""gunfight"" happened IN the O. K. Corral (it did not; it occorred on Freemont Street) and that it lasted for far over 15 minutes (it lasted less then 30 seconds; perhaps as little as 25 seconds).There is no excuse for a producer to have made a film that is laughable at the time this movie was made except for, imho, laziness. Someone did scant, if any, reserch, and it shows.It's a terrible movie.Read about the incident from a couple of different sources and you'll see just how bad this represents the facts.Don't buy this one. It passes for comedy more than for drama."
5,One of the ten greatest Westerns ever!,"This Western shares honors with The Wild Bunch, The searchers, The Tall T. Naked Spur, Stagecoach and The man from the West an obligated reference and still remains one of the most solid cult movies ever made.The cast is impressive too. Lancaster is superb as Wyatt Earp and Douglas as Doc Holiday.This is the best Western directed by the great John sturguess. No doubt it and go for it."
1,Terrible Transfer to DVD,"This is absolutely no improvement on the poor VHS video tape.A travesty.I subtract all stars for the terrible transfer, menu, and options."
2,"Watch ""Tombstone"" or ""Wyatt Earp"" instead","Both my husband and I found this film to be a groaner and will probably take it to the used store for trade in. It's not one we will watch again or recoomend.We found three major flaws in this film:It opens with hokey 70's soundtrack music that's the Western equivalent for disco in the vein of lyrical content. The instrumental soundtrack was similarly intrusive and annoying.The producers literally stole a scene from the film's predecessor, ""My Darling Clementine."" In both films, during a fight someone shoots down the candalabra in the saloon and thus sets the place on fire while the piano play shifts to eight-to-the-bar happy music. That might have been a grand scene for ""Clementine"" but this could have been more original.And while we're at it, in 1881, there was no ""Oklahoma City"" for a gunfight to take place in."
2,WTF?,"Listen. I get it. You can't compare a movie made in 1957 to a movie like Tombstone. That being said. This flick wasn't even accurate, at all. Wyatt Earp with no mustache? In every picture or tale of this man, he has that big a** mustache. 5 min fight at the O.K. Corrall? It lasted 30 seconds in reality and the list goes on.The sets, bad. Pacing? Yawn! And Kirk Douglas as Doc? Not horrible but reality is, this was good when we didn't know better.Get TOMBSTONE! Next to THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, it's the best western ever made. Kurt Russell as Wyatt and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday (he should have gotten an Academy Award} that's the story you wanna see.Pass on this."
2,Not very good!,"Oddly un-entertaining and over-directed try at the O.K.Corral.Amasing that fine director John Sturges, who made such good movies as ""The great escape"" and ""Bad day at Black Rock"", didn't make this one better! Even the final shoot-out is boring and disappointing as is the title-song by Frankie Laine. Grab ""My Darling Clementine"" or ""Tombstone"" instead!"
4,Name says it All,Exactly what it says...a checklist for nearly every item you could think of that you would want to check out before buying a house. Almost too many details but easy to use. A good investment if purchasing a house.
4,"Humorous, riveting in the tradition of Sayers and Paretsky","I've been reading Melisa Michaels' books for years, and have always found the sense of humor she brings to the subject wonderful. When she combines this with a well-told mixture of hard-boiled detective and modern fantasy, the result is excellent.Readers who have enjoyed Sarah Paretsky or Dorothy Sayers in the past may see some pleasing similarities in a few of the characters. The client, for example, is a dead ringer for Lord Peter Wimsey, seen from the outside world's point of view.If you're looking for fantasy written for someone past adolescence, pick this book up, and be sure to share it with a friend. You won't be sorry."
4,Fabulous!!,"My favorite song on this entire album is ""I've seen that face before."" Musically and lyrically it's a wonderful trip to a dark, mysterious place that I'm sure you have in your own mind.Another notable favorite is ""Slave To The Rhythym."" Overall, wonderful music and lyrically captivating throughout."
3,Curiously appealing,"I am a ""rock and guitar"" man, but there is something appealing about many of Grace Jones' efforts. Her vocals can be very effective such as in her fine cover of La Vie en Rose. Even the idea of someone like her tacklng a song like that is unusual to put it mildly. But she carries it off very well and the strong accordion work (or accordion-synth) gives a distinctly European feel to many of her songs. Also she just has a first rate band of backing musicians with superb bass and marvellously atmospheric keyboards that can be positively intoxicating. My favorites are ""La Vie on Rose"", ""I've seen that Face Before"" and ""Walking in the Rain"". I challenge you not to be swept along by the great rhythms on these. I want the man who composed those basslines in my band (I'm sure it was not Grace)!"
3,Very much a slave to this rhythm!,"Feeling like a woman, looking like a man...are words from the track ""Walking In The Rain"" a hypnotic discoey song. Grace Jones is an amazing person with unusual and compelling presence. She is also an accomplished singer, qualified to sing Edith Piaf's ""La Vie En Rose"".A veritable disco queen of the 70's and model based in Paris for a time. With her trademark haircut and cigarette protruding from her gob, Grace speaks fluent French and is reputed to have intimidated Arnold Schwarzenegger with a ""fighting stick"" and her level of aggression, whilst shooting a scene in the movie ""Conan the Destroyer"".Island Life is a ""best of "" CD, and all songs are good songs, ""Slave To The Rhythm"" is another interesting song containing subtle variations. If you only want one Grace Jones CD in your collection, make it this one."
3,Good and not so good together,"Jones can't really sing, but her music is in part about attitude, and she had plenty of that. She also had sly dunbar and robbie shakespeare as her rhythm section, and it's hard to beat that for this type of music (which wasn't really disco, and wasn't quite funk). Pull up to the Bumper is a dance song par excellence."
4,"It's Bumpin""",Grace Jones Is Groovin on this Disc.Pull Up To The Bumper is the jam to this day.Alot Of Grooves&Jams Here.You can Bump TO this.it's A Good Disc.
4,Still a good yarn,"Once again, Hogan's ideas are better that their execution. If he had real flesh and blood characters that actually developed I would gladly give a *****, but alas, Hunt seems as predictable as ever. Only that ZORAC alien is more formulaic. But these characters are only a foil for the real story: The discovery of mankind's origins and the problem facing us today now that we have finally met the allegedly died-out race.Best aspects: Great VR, description of the Giant's world, the almost magical technology.Worst aspects: Characters and style"
5,Beautiful!,What a beautiful journey into the depths of the mind and soul. I was amazed as he desperately searched to find his profound place in the universe while struggling with the desires of his flesh. I felt like I was there with him learning and growing.
4,Quite beautiful in its simplicity...,"I really enjoyed Siddhartha's journey, especially the way in which he rejects being ""told"" the meaning of life, the secret of happiness, etc. One cannot learn by being lectured or taught; instead, it is important for all of us to find the message on our own through experience. It is only through exposure to the world -- the good, bad, and ugly -- that we can find what is truly important. I found this spiritual message pertinent and worthwhile. This is definitely a book that will appeal to a large audience, no matter what your religious or spiritual beliefs..."
5,Amazing!,"this book is simply amazing! and when i say simply, i also mean that it is an interestingly simple book... very short and concise... and yet filled with so much knowledge and meaning... it really is a treatise on life itself.this book truly is a two way conversation. you just cant help wondering, asking new question you've never asked before... some books are strictly written for the excitement, making them a one way conversation, the author just telling you things and there is nothing you can say that will make what he (or she) said better... but this book, as i said, truly is the opposite of that.read the book and you will know where I am coming from... it is a great book and worthyto be read by everyone..."
4,Great book...very spiritual and touching,"The book Siddhartha was a great book. It showed the reader how some people need to go through many stages of their life to find where they are truly happy. Siddhartha was a young boy on a search for true happiness, and to find his true ""self."" Siddhartha finally found his inner self, and who he really was. I really enjoyed reading this book and it taught me a lot about life, and its values."
1,Profound?,"I am wondering why Hermann Hesse gave the name of ""Siddhartha"" to this novel. As people over the age of 23 know, Siddhartha was the given name of the Buddha.So, naturally, young people would grab the book, and read through it, and say to each other, ""Wow! Listen to this!"" --- while they were only reading the completely stupid thoughts of Hesse himself.I am afraid that this goes for ""Steppenwolf"" and ""Magister Ludi"" as well --- it's all Hermann Hesse's jejune philosophy, and none of it works, unless you're toking at the same time. ""Wow! Listen to this, dude!""It is entirely amazing to me that fifty years on, I would realize that the philosophy of J.R.R. Tolkien was absolutely rock-solid, while the philosophy of Hesse was completely incoherent.After all, Hesse was a ""serious novelist,"" while Tolkien only wrote ""fantasy.""Nevertheless, Tolkien was, in most questions, right. SeeThe Philosophy of Tolkien: The Worldview Behind The Lord of the Ringsfor the details!"
2,This book is not for a self-instruction,"I was pleasantly surprised to see a Teach Yourself Tagalog book was finally offered to the public. Upon opening the book, however, it was clear that the book would not do its job. The authors, for one thing, neglected to write stress marking on the Tagalog words so whoever uses this book and tries to pronounce will end up sounding like a blundering idiot. They had a lot of Tagalog literature at their disposal to help them with their explanations that it appears they didn't use. Whoever buys this book will have to ask a native to write the stress marking on each word so they can really learn to speak the Tagalog language. What a shame they published it in its current state!"
5,I'M THE WALKING DUUDE!,"Classic album (I do have the cd and the album, but nothing like popcorn with some good music)Bello's bassing is amazing and his energy level is off the CHAIN! Charlie's drumming is like no other! Scott is a mad man moshing all over the stage (when this record came out). Spitz soloing is-well, PERFECT, PERIOD! And Joey. What can be said about Joey that has not been already been said? I'm glad he's back with the (2nd) original line-up. I still listen to this cd regularly. John Bush was great also but this is Bellodanno's band. I've seen them when Danny Lilker was playing with them at L'AMORE'S IN Brooklyn (BROOKLYN, STAND UP). One of the BEST thrash bands, EVER! Metallica (with Cliff!), Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax. Those are the fore-fathers of thrash! Get at me if you think NOT.--- NOT.--- NOT."
5,Great Classic Thrash-Metal,I can't believe it has taken me this long to replace this album on CD when my first copy of this album was on vinyl.
4,Among their best.,"Among the Living is one of Anthrax's most popular albums. In my opinion it is a little overrated more than we give due credit. For years I thought Anthrax was ""unworthy"" of being in the Big Four, my friends, fellow metalheads I apologize for my younger days. Among the Living is a classic thrash and metal album. With songs like the title track, Indians, A.D.I this album will not dissapoint. I really like the song N.F.L, I'm a fan of the gang vocal shouts, It gives a punk feeling to the whole band. If you ask me, Anthrax has one of the best drummers in the business. Overall, if you want a thrash metal collection you must have this album along with their masterpiece, Persistence of Time. 4 Stars, a good album, not a masterpiece but still good."
5,Classic Thrash,"This is an essential album for thrash fans, and together with ""Worship Music,"" it showcases one of the best thrash bands still going."
4,STU MEAT SAYS,"awsome band awsome album. first concert i ever went to was anthrax, this is one of the best. best of classic anthrax here."
4,most thrash bores me but....,"Most thrash is the worst metal ever imo, it's half what melodic metal is in songwriting and playing. However anthrax has enough knowledge of real guitar playing to actually be very good. And even non thrash fans like me can really enjoy their 1980's output. There's only a few thrash bands that I think were talented enough to even do melodic metal and this is one of them. Metalica, megadeath and a few others also come to mind. But with this one anthrax started a run of great thrash metal cd's. This is a powerful and fun cd. THe fun lasted until the early 90's with this band. By then they went totally hard and forgot the humor but here it's intact. These guys loved melodic metal so that influence keeps them from becoming what most thrash is today: limited one string boredom.So this band and this cd joins my metal collection as one of the few thrash bands that I would ever have in my collection. It's great at what it does. rock on."
3,CLASSIC ANTHRAX,"You'll like this album if you are into heavy metal already. It sounds a little dated now, especially compared to Anthrax's much superior current records. If you really want to hear some great loud music, pick up Volume 8: The Threat Is Real by Anthrax."
3,Overrated,"Sticky (and repetitive) riffs + irritating vocals + forgettable solos = Among the LivingFunny, but not very produced.I prefer more produced Anthrax records like Stomp 442."
1,Overhyped &Overrated!,"Anthrax should have changed their name after their powerful debut if this was the new direction they were headed.This band's sound changed so dramatically it was astounding. I blame them for helping to destroy true heavy metal. They started trends that led to heavy metal going underground before a re-emerging.I remember hearing ""Death from Above"" from their debut on a metal radio show and being blown away by the power it delivered.I am judging this album because Anthrax let me and other metalheads down with this new punkcore direction. Had this been their debut I would not be so critical,however even on its own it still bores me.No real memorable riffs here. With this album Anthrax gave Heavy Metal a dirty beating and left it severely injured in an alley."
5,Best Anthrax album,"This is the best Anthrax album and it has some great classic songs such as ""Caught in a Mosh"", ""I am the Law"", and ""Indians"". This is Anthrax at their peak and they never got any thrashier than this. This is a thrash metal classic right up there with Slayer's Reign in Blood, Sepultura's Beneath the Remains, and Sodom's Persecution Mania. True trash metal here, this is only for true fans of the thrash metal genre."
5,Anthrax_Among the Best,"From classic speed metal this album everything that IS metal. From classics like I am The Law and Among the Living, Anthrax shows why they are veterans of the rock world and how these new 'poser' bands just cannot compare musically or lyrically. Their usage of speed and heavy riffs, combined with brilliant vocals makes me wonder what happened to society. How have we come to let poser bands rule when bands like Anthrax still exist with such complexity to their music. One will never know. Britney and the Backstreet Boys probably have deals with Satan and this is my new found hell. Metal! Come back we miss you!!"
4,Among some things....,"Among some things I like about this rerelease is the sound quality is MUCH better than the original. I've personally been waiting for Anthrax to remaster both ""Spreading..."" and ""State..."" as they both have brutal sound compared to things recorded in this day and age...but I digress.It's also nice to finally have a DVD version of my OLD VHS. Mostly for the 2 above reasons, I would recommend buying this. I wish I could recommend the previously unreleased stuff, but it's all rather weak, I gave them a listen but they weren't something i'd go out of my way to hear again."
5,Thrash lives.,"It's albums like this that have kept Thrash metal one of the most powerful, dominant types of metal music ever. This album is pure metal awesomeness."
5,For ALL METAL FANS!,People who enjoy metal should at least have 1 Anthrax CD in their collection. For those who don't this is one of the best ones to have. All the tracks are awesome on this masterpiece.
4,"Mosh, Baby","""Among the Living"" is often considered as greatest Anthrax album ever. There's of course the songs ""N.F.L."", ""Caught in a Mosh"", ""I Am the Law"", Indians"", and ""Among the Living"" which all are still very popular choices for set list. However, there's three songs that aren't so great classics. ""One World"", ""A.D.I./Horror of It All"", and ""Imitation of Life"". They are alright songs but comparing to the album ""Spreading the Disease"", this album is left as second. Anthrax was a good thrash metal band but they lost their touch after this album apart from couple of good songs. Finally I have to say that I love the drumming in this album, especially ""Caught in a Mosh"". It makes me mosh...HARD!Stars: Caught in a Mosh, Indians, I Am the Law"
5,nice piece of thrash,what else is there to say? if you like real metal get your hands on this masterpiece.
4,solid great album,"this is a great solid album from the ""big fours"" most underrated band this a great band that more metal heads need to get into but back to the album the first five trackks are great awsome i love listeining to it with a great opener and the classic anthrax song caught in a moshthan the song that is one of my favorite anthrax song ever i am the law than we go to the song efilnukinfusin after we have skeletons in the closet which is another awsome songf but than we have indians no a horrible song but it ruins the flow a little bit the next track one world is my least favorite this album can do withought that we have a.d.i a cool song not bad and than immitation of life good song not boring good closer"
5,Great album,One of THE defining metal albums of it's generation. I saw that the whole band was getting back together to record/release a new album with a tour and had to replace this one that went missing. Still awesome.
2,Too sweet,"I cannot believe my taste would be so different from the rest of the world. This perfume is very sweet, not too long lasting and overall it's just a blah perfume. Nothing special. Not too bad but definitely not my taste."
5,Potpourri of Cooking and Culture,"Mary Land's Louisiana Cookery is a fascinating and highly readable popourri of the cookery and culture of all areas of Louisiana, with emphasis on preparation of fish and game .This book, first published by the L.S.U. Press in 1954 must be the foundation of many of the later books on Louisiana cuisine as it encompasses the history of Louisiana food and drink.No part of a meal is neglected ---this book has it all. Highly recommended by one who loves to both eat and read about good food"
1,Don't waste your money,"Even though there was a much cheaper version of this I spent the extra money thinking I would be getting a better quality kitchen tool. When it came it was of clearly cheap manufacture, made in china. Tried it on one egg it worked ok with some effort. Trying on a second egg splattered yolk all over the table and table cloth. Save your money and tap the egg with a knife!"
1,Not,Besides looking like a circumscision tool ... this thing doesn't top a pouched egg for crap. Always leaves shells behind ... a pain.
4,Pragmatic,The author has a clear approach on some key areas of marketing and sales processes. Very pragmatic questions and key points that certainly provide some meaningful insights for creating your own GTM strategy.The only point I think could have deeper content is about implmentation of GTM plans. There are just a few pages addressing this topic which certainly is the most challangeble part of the whole process.Nice book for having on your office desk.
4,Birthday Gift for our 7 yr old grandson,This was suggested by our 7 yr old grandson's mother for him. He is compulsive about finishing the Legos he has had before and we thought this one a real challange. IT WAS. This one took longer to do and was harder for him. He loved it..
5,sub 21 is coming,This set is the best Lego set I have ever gotten. I love it. The firing tarpedo works well and the sub has some real looking details on it. AWSOME!!!!!!!
5,This should be mandatory reading!,"This book reads like a documentary film. It is quick and to the point. It will shake the foundation of what you have perceived to be ""good"" in the business of animals. Do the zoos pander to the public to give them ""babies"" every season? Or does the public accept what zoos tell us as the way it is supposed to be? This book should be mandatory reading for anyone in the animal business (zookeepers, directors, zoo visitors, pet shop owners, dealers, USDA staff, vets, etc) and that includes just about everyone breathing air. Your stomach will churn with vivid accounts of what happens to our precious fuzzy critters. This book shows what determined detective work will uncover, and that is the ugly truth of the animal underworld."
1,NEGATIVE WITH NO SOLUTIONS,"This book sounded great. After reading the first few chapters,I decided it was just ranting and finger pointing with nothing positive to say.By the end of the book,I was rooting for animal dealers! Solutions should start at the top-dont let zoos eliminate unwanted animals.Its just like having a pet on a larger scale.If you cant make a lifetime(its lifetime) commitment,dont get one!"
1,Poorly researched,"Looks like it was compiled from 3rd and 4th hand animal rights sources. Much of it is outright misinformation and is an attempt to convince the average person that buying and selling exotic animals is illegal. In fact, anyone with a USDA permit may breed and sell exotic animals. Anyone with a USDI permit may breed, buy and sell captive bred endangered species. Only the AZA doesn't allow zoos within their membership to sell to non-AZA sources, but the AZA is only an organization and may not make nor enforce laws concerning exotic animals. This book was published as an effort to drum up support of a ban on private ownership of exotic animals and should be disreguarded by serious exotic animal keepers as extremist rantings."
3,Sad state of Affairs,This book is really a reality test on the cruelty and indifference of humans towards animals that no longer serve a purpose. i guess i always suspected that the road side operator was less about conservation and more about exploitation however how so called accredited/professional zoos are part of an animals slow road to obscurity in a back yard zoo or worse is really what disturbed me the most. good read thou the layers of facts can at time be confusing and dilute the central message.
5,Success for Beginning Readers!,"This book is perfect for children who are just learning to read! The colorful illustrations on each page give the reader lots of clues to help them with their first attempts at reading. The book contains a review of the alphabet, pictures with labels (such as parts of the body), rebus stories, and stories made of only one, two, three, or four words. There is a lot of rhyme and playfulness which makes this book a joy to share with a beginning reader. As a first grade teacher, I plan on buying many copies of this book for my classroom to help my beginning readers feel SUCCESSFUL!"
4,"""Cute"" Critters","The illustrations on this game are great. I found this for under $5 at my local Target store. For that price, it is a simple game that the kids enjoy. While there is a little bit of strategy, it is mostly luck. One complaint is that the ""cards"" are not shaped like cards, but are more square, which makes shuffling them pretty much impossible (for me anyway!). We have one of those cheap, automatic shufflers and it can usually do the trick."
3,Old time Calypso music,"The songs my grandparents use to sing...old time calypso...I find them fun...my children find them out of date...no shock there...wish the clairty was a bit better, but I am sure the issue is the original recordings not the CD itself."
2,90' of wire.,"Carefully measured twice. 90 ft 2"".This wire is decent quality and gauge, but shorting the customer 10 feet/percent is sketchy. Especially, if you're like me, and you carefully calculated what you needed, but are now forced to buy another 100' spool and/or solder things because you were left 6' short, spread over 2x33' (30' actual) runs.Anyway, shame on Raptor. The price and quality is fine even at 90', but you can't just lie to customers who are counting on getting 100'.Obviously my specific issue is rare, but still...If QC can't wrap 100' 2' on a spool (and oddly gets exactly 90' on there), then you might want to beware."
4,Aluminum??,"I was surprised to find that when I received the speaker wire that it wasn't copper. The roll was very light, so my assumption is that it is aluminum instead of copper. I was disappointed in this but I have used it anyway and find that it works well."
1,NOT Oxygen Free Copper!,"I don't know what others received, but I am extremely disappointed. This wire is not as advertised, it is definitely not premium quality copper wire. When my two packages arrived, I had ordered some other stuff along with it, I thought it didn't get shipped. There was no way it could be in these light, small boxes. Then I opened them and found this wire that looks like stuff from the 99 cents store. If I wanted cheap, basic speaker wire I would have just ordered the RCA speaker wire. Price is too good to be true, back to Amazon it goes!"
3,Too Thick,"For Satellite speakers these are way too thick to be moving them around in your living room. If you're concealing these behind a wall or through a suspended ceiling then I'm sure they're ok, but you really could go with a thinner wire and get similar audio result. I ended up not even using these."
3,Fun but still not as good as book two,"In Masks of the Martyrs Jack Chalker brings his strangely fun space swashbuckler to a close. Hawks and his crew of pirates/revolutionaries must take the last two rings and shut down Master System all while dodging the tyranical computer's minions as well as those who would use the rings to rule humanity themselves. We find out more details about the pirates of the Thunder, Chalker again puts them in a really bizarre situation in order to get ring four, and there is lots of fun to be had in the heroics and space battles.This book falls short in that the end was something of an anticlimax and I did not find myself really caring for the the characters I followed through the four books. Somewhere about halfway through I began to feel detached and a little bored at times. However, Chalker came through with some memorable moments and truly inventive situations that kept me going to the end."
4,Great condition,"The book was used, as advertised, but in great condition. Delivery wasn't as quick as hoped, but I did select standard delevery. Overall, I a pleased with the purchase and would buy from this source again."
2,Back to the belt,"I wore this beltless system for 2 days, and that was enough. Have to agree with the other reviewer who strongly disliked the bag positioning. They rode way too far behind me, and adjusting the system - major pain!! (tried every conceivable configuration) - doesn't help the problem. You simply can't see the tools you need without having to swing the pouches around in front of you. The whole set up is very cumbersome. Also, wearing this system in warm weather is really uncomfortable.However, I picked up the 3"" Ranger belt and a few pouches, snips and drill holsters, and I LOVE this setup. Most comfortable belt I've ever worn, and I've worn a bunch. Gotta' wear one loaded for a day to believe it. Highly recommended.I'm sold on Occidental belts. The beltless system, however, will likely disappoint."
4,"Another enjoyable installment, well-read","Another enjoyable installment in this series. This one has the added feature of a story from ""She Who Must Be Obeyed""'s perspective, aptly titled ""Hilda's Story"" and relating a case where Hilda susses out the solution even before Rumpole. Other installments include ""Little Boy Lost,"" about an alleged kidnapping with a remarkably unsympathetic defendant and ""Rumpole and the Angel of Death,"" where Rumpole has to defend a doctor accused of committing murder in the guise of euthanasia. Ever entertaining, with marvelous turns of phrase, and splendidly read by Patrick Tull and (with the one story) Susan Tanner."
4,Tussle between spouses to read book first,My husband and I fought for rights to read this book first. Because there are 6 short stories we alternated ownership. Very enjoyable
4,Soft Style Women's Angel Pump,This was an excellent product for the price. Very comfortable and very classy looking! The color is very rich and you can wear them with any color. True fit to size!
1,"NOT leather- ""ALL MAN-MADE Materials""","Shoe is advertized as a leather upper. When it comes it is clearly marked as ""ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS"" inside the heel. Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15% restocking fee for a ""damaged shoebox"" to 50% for ""trying-on wear."" Seller is a rip-off. Do not buy! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use."
1,Shoe was returned. Size too small compared to same size when bought at store.,"The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state. Then, I received the wrong color. Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store. Even when color and size were wrong, I had to return to store at my own expense. Poor custumer service. I will not buy from this company again."
2,They're just ok,"Not the best fit, and not the best color. I wear them occasionally but not often. My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles."
2,Runs small,Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small. Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too.
5,Great Shoes,These are great shoes but they run a little on the small side. I usually take a 7.5 and that is what I purchased and they were too small. Next time I will order an 8 and that should be perfect. I love the shoes...
2,Disappointed,"This shoe is pretty and stylish, but not true to size. I ordered a medium width. The shoe fit OK except for the heel, which was way too narrow. I had to return them."
1,not good for big girls,i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand. needed 11 ew. to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick. a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast. i returned them. i suggest cloudwalkers instead.
1,not leather and slipery,I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came. It is pretty but has a slipery sole. And it is not leather as advertised.
4,Overpriced,"Quality item & worth paying an extra few dollars for. However, the suggested retail price for this item is $9.99 as seen on Monster Cable's web site."
1,Too confusing!,"Very confusing book starting with a short presentation of Corgi. Then comes many pages listing short notes about models, these are listed partially by vehicles number but not always chronological, totally confusing and frustrating. No listing of variants, so you would not be helped if you need information about this. (Which is a popular subject among collectors.) Then comes a picture section, that does not match the listing, and also very short description under the pictures. I have used hours to work my way through this booklet just because of this weird non matching listing. In the end, it starts listing up cars again, this section should have been together with the first one and not been split up by the picture section. The pictures was too small and did not show good enough details of details, decals and stickers, as I would expect from a book specializing on Corgi. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, and I regret I bought it."
1,5 stars for puppy 0 for netwerk,on the first version they cut off the first 10 min. now they mess up the sound big time. the sound just constantly shifts into one speaker. I have to just put the cd on and mute the dvd
1,"Absolutely, purely, 100% skippable","I wonder why I am editing this review after 2 years because the sales records of this book must have already spoken volumes by now, but I guess I dont want others to spend money on such absolutely disappointing 'material'. Which is what it is, it is certainly not a book. If you are looking for light-years worth of textual reading fodder on the exalted subject of Java Beans and Servlets technology (which are both presumably well established by now), this may be good bed-side reading. If on the other hand you want hands-on code samples with explanations of J2EE oriented concepts, forget this and get yourself a decent book like ""Mastering Java Beans"" or any of the Wrox titles on the subject. This was one of those useless quick-to-market type books that usually come out in a flurry to cash in on a new technology's hype. Hope this helps you spend your penny wisely."
1,Never received this book,"never received this book, company did not reply to my e-mails, do not order from this company!!!"
1,wrong product,I waa shipped the wrong book and when I sent an e-mail to Amazon I got no response. I was in need of the textbook right away and could not wait the time it was required to mail it back and order it again. I will think twice before ordering from amazon again.
5,Shattering study of the loneliness !,"This is the real masterpiece of Vitorio de Sica . An old man succumbes to the ravages of the age. An uncompromising denounce and a powerful reflection about the golden ages in the life of that lonely man , forgotten by all his most fellow friends .The movie is extremaly haunting and poignant . You will face in all its harsh reality the last consequences of what this hard but sadly moment comes but it is so well written , tastefully directed and even better acted that you may consider this one as one the best italian films of this decade .The anguish , loneliness and desperation have never better told and you should wait for forty years for another gem which deals with that related theme ; We are fine of Giussepe Tornatore .A sumptuous and master film !"
3,Relentlessly depressing,"I have rarely, if ever, had such a difficult time watching a movie to its conclusion. It's the depression factor that makes it so difficult to watch -- especially as this is purportedly an accurate description of life in Italy (for some) after the war. I would prefer to think the story was merely fabricated from de Sica's imagination...Besides the the movie's chronicling of human denigration and humiliation, please note: there are scenes that dog-lovers might find unbearable. (To describe them would give away the plot, insofar as there is a plot.)I know there is some fine film-making going on here, but I can't recommend the movie to friends: it depressed the ... out of me, and would likely do the same to them."
2,Boring and Melodramatic,"I thought this was going to be a gritty, realistic, existentialist movie, artfully done. Instead, its full of melodramtic fifties music, slooow moving, and ends with you saying to yourself ""is that it?"". This movie is just boring. If it weren't so melodramatic, it may be possible to sympathize with the old man, which is the crux of the film to begin with."
5,Love the film,"After having read some of the reviews from others, I am pleased that so many of different ages agree with the opinion I have had for decades. I saw it in college and love it just as much now as I did then. I know real people, not actors, were used in many neorealistic films, and that makes it even more special. This film makes you think and feel, and cry. If you are worried about crying or being sad, see it anyway. We all cry for different reasons at different times. I have a dog just like in the movie. I am also on a pension, too. Years ago, this wasn't so for me. It is just a beautifully well made movie. Who cannot love De Sica? When you learn details on the movie, it makes even more sense that this is a must see movie."
4,A Middlegame Problem Book,"The core of this book is 30 tests in a series of increasing complexity where the reader is asked to choose from 3 reasonable alternative plans for each test. In one test, you may be given the following alternatives: a) Should you try to close the center and attack on the kingside? b)Double the enemy's pawns and pile up on the open file? c)Or take the initiative and prepare a central pawn advance? You're not thrown into the tests without preparation as the authors first discuss (with 7 detailed games) ways to analyze, asess, and implement a plan. I would say that this book is a positional brother to all those chess tactics books. If you can find it, well worth buying."
3,Product not as illustrated! Be careful or your wrist my suffer more.,"I purchased this product because I have been working on my computer longer hours and my wrist started to hurt. I did the search and found this product wish seems to work perfect. However, at the time of receiving so, I notice the metal ring that holds the strap sets on top of your wrist bone. Not a pleasant feeling when using it for long times. The product is clearly falsely promoted or quality assurance did not performed a good job before sending as approved to used."
5,easy to wear under gloves,"I have extreme carpal tunnel and use this wrist support device under gloves --such as when washing dishes and cleaning the house, winter gloves, or oven mitts. My other wrist support device is better for sleeping (more support) but it doesn't work with gloves."
2,Not enough support,"Looking at the picture, it seemed to me this would be a good wrist support and would allow me to use my hand while wearing it. However, I found it did not offer much wrist support and was uncomfortable."
5,Easily the best braces for computer usage (especially MACbooks!),"For the longest time every time I used my desktop (i have small computer space so my wrists ending up bending on the edge) or using my MacBook pro my wrists would hurt and it would be very distracting. While Carpal Mate isn't quite as effective and you may feel slightly more discomfort than with the more popular full size braces, it provides more range of motion and is a lot easily to get in and out of. These are also much much better for gaming."
5,Perfect for my problem,"I place too much weight on my wrist while using the mouse. This protects me from applying pressure on my wrist/carpal tunnel and has eliminated the pain and symptoms.It still gives me flexibility, and I can use it easily with my mouse and keyboard.RECOMMENDED!"
3,It's okay,"This product is okay. It helps when there is minor pain and it isn't as cumbersome as a whole splint, but it doesn't do anything to limit the movement on the top of the hand. All in all, I'm glad I have this item, but when the pain gets really bad I have to put on the regular splint instead of this."
2,Not enough support,This brace offers no side to side support for the wrist and did nothing for my carpel tunnel. I'll have to switch to a brace that goes all the way around the wrist.
2,Strangles more than helps,"At first it, the supports helped. But after a while, I felt my blood vessels becoming more and more restricted. I gradually had to loosen the supports to the point where they were so loose, I might as well have not worn them. So I stopped. I've decided to instead purchase an ergonomic keyboard and mouse (I'm still waiting on the keyboard, but so far, just using an ergonomic mouse has made a WORLD of a difference). And yes, I brought the mouse (and will be bringing in the keyboard) to work. As far as home computer use goes, I've just cut down drastically. (Try to relax all muscles when typing, don't type too hard, stretch/shake out your hands/wrists often, keep your elbows close to your sides if you're using a regular keyboard, etc.) The scream-out-loud pain hasn't returned since. Though there's still a little discomfort and/or pain every now and then, but hopefully that'll change once I receive my keyboard."
3,"Does what is supposed to, maybe a little too much","Nice material, seems well built it's not uncomfortable to wear however it does immobilizes your wrist to a degree that using a mouse or keyboard becomes really hard and that was the reason I bought it in the first place. I wanted the black one but didn't see how to change the color and got the beige one anyhow I do use it after extended periods of computer usage to rest my wrist and carpal tunnel but I'm unable to perform fluid mouse movements and when I type sometimes I can hit others keys with the glove."
5,Good choice,The wrist support was available through Amazon quicker than I could buy it locally and at a lower price. A great find.
2,Not comfortable.,I was wearing this to work at the hospital because it's small enough to wear under my gloves. I do not like it because it rubs an irritating spot on my palm within a couple of hours. But it does somewhat help my carpal tunnel if i could stand the rubbing.
3,Tempurpedic Material Sample is Better,"A bit rigid and cumbersome if you still need to use a mouse at your computer. Call Tempurpedic and request a sample of their foam, and then use it to rest your wrist on; it works better for reducing strain! NO JOKE!!!"
4,Carpal Mate,The FlA Ortho CarpalMate Professional Carpal Wrist Support Black # 22-1401000 works perfectly. Unfortunately I developed a rash....
2,Little to no use,"This item provides little to no support. The band that goes around your wrist must be secured tightly in order to keep the single brace in place and even then it hardly provides any support. Being so tight caused additional pain in my wrist and I found myself constantly squeezing the wrist band to allow circulation. I think if I used this product for an extended period it would make my wrist pain much worse rather than better. Also, the single support under the hand does not keep your hand in a neutral position; you can bend your wrist backward as much as you like which is a problem for most people. After finally visiting a doctor about my wrist pain I was given a full wrist support that had braces behind and above the hand. The doctor's brace has 3 velcro straps to ensure proper fit and secure bracing of the wrist w/o causing circulation problems.My advise is to see a doctor; if you cannot do that find a brace that has multiple adjustments and braces above and behind the wrist."
3,Works well but not a game changer,"These braces fit very well and offer a unique support that I haven't had before with other carpal tunnel braces. I can easily type and use the mouse, however, they havn't been as effective as I hoped for relieve symptoms. For the first week I used them they extended the periods for when my hands fell asleep, but then became less effective as time went on."
1,"No support, No return/refund",I purchased this product based on positive reviews. I tried it out and was so unhappy with it.My wrist had very little support. I could bend it up because there was nothing to keep it from doing that.When I called to return it I was told that State hygiene laws prevented returns for this product. So I am stuck with something I find useless.
2,Allows for too much movement,"Based on some favorable reviews I ordered this wrist support. It sounded like it would be the ideal solution for my wrist pain which is caused by long hours of computer work.However, this did not work for me at all. While it works great supporting the hand/wrist from falling ""downward"", it did not keep my wrist from bending upward (or as another reviewer here says ""backward""), which is something that I seem to be doing when typing. So if your pain is caused by bending your wrist downward too much, this is the brace for you. If, on the other hand, you are like me and tend to bend your hand slightly upward, you should look for something else. Regrettably I had to return this."
1,Didn't help my carpal tunnel - better products are out there,"This product did me no good as it provides little support and only keeps your wrist from bending forward, not back. I picked up an Ace wrist brace at the supermarket and for the same price, it's a much better value and actually works! My hand feels much better with it on.ACE Wrist Brace with Splint Support, Left, MediumBy the way, the Ace brace says ""left hand"" but it works for either hand."
1,Concept looked good...but!,"Had I relaized the Velcro strap on top was so stiff that it would cut down my circulation, I never would have ordered...and I had it loose! My advice is to stick with longer more pliable wrist supports, and go to your local Sports medicine clinic for a form fitted working support. I used to have some & they were wonderful!"
1,Useless,"I tightened it as much as possible, but does not really do anything to stabilize the wrist. Look elsewhere."
1,When will it arrive?,"I can't wait to try this product! Not sure why it took four days to ship, but I guess I'll get it...someday...I guess I should have ordered directly from drugstore.com, instead of going through Amazon's third party drop shipper."
3,Not as good as I expected...,This film didn't have very much depth to it. It was a very sweet story but it wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be! I think the characters really needed more emotion. The message wasn't completely clear either. It had a good plot and good actors and actresses but other than that... I would recomend you rent this movie before buying it but that's just my opinion.
4,You will NOT get the Bonus Disc if you order here,"The disc itself is great but I was really hoping to get 'Always New Depths', as it is listed in Disc 2 of the Track Listing above. Much to my displeasure, ONLY THE MAIN DISC was included in my CD case.It is listed one (1) disc in the Product Description (they sent what was promised), but then two (2) discs are listed in the Track Listing, so DON'T BE FOOLED. The fine print says the bonus disc is included for the first 15,000 sold. D'oh."
3,Not a patch on the original,"A collection of overly-similar but mostly disinteresting remixes. The original rocks, this one rocks you to sleep."
5,A Hand-Spinner's Favorite!,I'm a totally addicted luxury fiber Spinner - & tho I'm not so crazy about the vocal tracks - the instrumentals are simply HYPNOTIC for any Spinner's Wheel or hand-spindling! It's part of my everyday play lists! Wonderful soothing muse-ic!
5,Sony Sound Forge 8 With Noise Reduction 2.0 by Sony Media Software [CD-ROM] (NS),"Excellent wave-editing software. Many excellent features. Needed for the upgrade version of Sony Sound Forge 9 or you can simply purchase the full, latest version. I've used Sound Forge for many years, starting when it was still developed by Sonic Foundry. Besides all its great features, one feature consistent with all versions is the ability to select individual channels. This is something I've never seen in any other wave-editing program."
5,Never Ignored by Me!,"The compilation of songs on this album is fabulous. Every song has both a unique sound, as well as being undeniably Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. Starting with Big Man's World, you are drawn into the world of The Seasons. It's beautiful and magical. The harmonies are perfect. The contrast between Frankie Valli's Falsetto and Nick Massi's bass is what made the Four Seasons what they are. You'll be amazed by the great music and lyrics for album cuts that shamefully never made it to the top of the charts. Do youself a very big favor, and buy this CD. But, just don't keep it to yourself. Share it with your family and friends. Since I have most of these treasures only on vinyl records, I havn't been unable to play these precious songs for years. With this CD, all of this beautiful music is re-born. Let the Four Seasons entertain you once again with their fabulous melodies, harmonies, and lyrics. I promise you that you won't be sorry!"
3,Fantastic Songs Last Forever !,"Great opening and ending songs definitely deserve goodreputations as well as everybody is, I believe^^, expecting theFifth Stage of Initial D coming soon.In my humble opinion the title could even supersede the tilelabeled, Initial D Non-Stop Mega Mix to whoever would beimpatient during Seventy Two minutes.Get on your own vehicle, and just turn it on!"
2,sounds funny,i dont know much about stereos but these do not sound goodPYLE PL1290BL 12-Inch 1200 Watt DVC Subwoofer
1,Magnet Fall Off,Hi the speakers work GREAT that is until the MAGNET FALLS OFF it would appear that there is not enough glue bond to the speaker frame and it JUST FELL OFFI heard a Clunk Noise in my speaker box and the speaker stopped working. Sure enough the magnets were in the bottom of the box. If the can fix the problem then I would say great product.
1,was good the first 5 days then blew up.,Im pissed off about the sub because when it got to my house it was dented in on the side really bad . I fixed it a little bit so it would work but then it blew up.
2,Dont buy from warehouse deals!,"Warehouse deals shipped my 37 pound order in a flimsy box with only thin brown wrapping paper as cussion, the box was completly riped up, and abel to see inside by the time it got to my house. One of my subwoofers was broken, the back wasnt eaven attached to the sub. The other one i bought was dented beyond abel to put it in a subwoofer box. And if your orders broke they cant replace it because it was apart of a deal. Its prolbly cheaper for me to try to fix it myself."
2,Ehh...,"These subs are going to be good for a beginner system... However, they do not handle any where near the amount they say.... 500 watts to push two would be okay.... MAYBE"
2,Dont bother,"well i got my subwoofers i ordered two of them and when i got them they were both damaged they looked like they have been dropped several times i hooked them up anyway they still worked but i owned one before this and they are ok you get decent bass out of them but this is the last pyle i go with im upgrading to rockford fosgate, memphis or the new alpine type x subwoofers if your looking for hard hitting bass dont bother spending your money on these subs there just a wast of time and anyway pyle doesnt protect their products very well there protected by a box and buble wrap so if there dropped during shipping wich they probably will be there going to get damaged"
1,junk,Pyle PL1290BL 12-Inch 1200 Watt DVC Subwooferthese subs suck i would never buy them again.. had them for only a month and they stopped working.. dont waist your money..
4,"Pyle 12"" slaps","I bought two of these and mounted them into a sealed box. WOW. They sound superb. Topped it off with the pyle pla-2210 1800 watt amp and I'm bumping down the road. The real test came when my buddy behind me said I was making his mirrors bump to my tunes. Inexpensive but very good for the price.I'd recommend getting a head unit such as the Kenwood Excelon kdc-x592 which has an adjustable subwoofer level setting. This works well because your not cranking up the bass on your component speakers too which can lead to some nasty distortion. Also, a capacitor may be necessary to save your electrical system (1 farad for every 500 watts). Expensive setup but well worth it in the end."
4,Great For The Price,"This product is perfect for a beginner system. I read All the Reviews which helped me with make my decision. My truck had been broken into and all my kicker stuff was stolen. low on cash and needing my thump back. decided to get two of these for my 97 gmc sierra. (Note: These subs are too big to be put in a truck box) I have a 1000 watt kenwood amp and they have no problem handleing 1000watt. these hit pretty good, don't hit the low notes very well, but in order to get some thump in your trunk these are perfect, cheap, beginner subs for cars. They're no kickers but they will get the job done. Would like to thank amazon for the amazing service and shipping i dont think i'll go anywhere else."
5,In this case you get ALOT more than what you pay for.,"I have one of theses in an MTX thunder box hooked to a 1000 watt infinity amp and I get asked all the time ""holy crap man what do you have in there"" well its ONE yes I said ONE of these PL1290BL in my 97 RAM 1500 in the back seat because well there is no trunk to put it in. And what happened next was I had to replace my driver side rear window because the bass was to much for it. Be careful cause in this case you get WAY MORE THAN WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
2,Failed after 4 months normal use,We purchased this subwoofer to replace a similar Pyle subwoofer received as a gift that failed after two weeks. It was a perfect fit for the original enclosure and the new subwoofer sounded even better. The new subwoofer stopped working after four months with normal use connected to a professionally installed 350W amp. Although the warranty says 12 months it costs over $30 shipping to return and replace whereas a new unit costs $40. When it works its a great value!
4,its great!!!,i love the sound for the low price and without a box. i have to wait till my box comes but i know for sure its going to sound great..thanks amazon
4,Great,I got these subs off a friend of mine and i love them.I got then hooked up to a 600 watt amp and bridged these dual voice coil and it packs one hell of a punch in my car.well worth the money
5,A blend of history & insanity into one glorious read.,"Buildings play a major role in most Norah Loftsnovels and this book, written under one of her pennames, features a mansion that has its roots inNorman Times. COPSI CASTLE is set in the 19thcentury and begins with the youngest Copsey heir,Magnus, beating his bride on their wedding night. The storyis mainly about how his bride got into such apredicament--how she and Magnus' father resolve thesituation. Lofts as usual blends history, human failings,love of a building, bravery, and insanity into oneglorious read. I've read this book and am looking to findTHE FALL OF MIDAS by the same author."
2,Get a different one.,Blows air ok but it is very noisy. I would not recommend it. I should have gotten the OE Replacement.
5,Brilliant,"This is my absolutely favorite movie!! I just saw the whole thing and I love it! I am a fan of quoting movies, famous people, and just about anything. Frankie and David's love of quotes was one of the things i just loved about the movie. The whole principal of the movie I love as well though. It is a love story, kind of traditional, but not really. Love it Love it Love it. Oh and a really specail bonus is that David reads Frankie some of Dr. Suess's sleep book to put her to sleep. That is my favorite book (don't ask, hehe)"
5,a dark look at life that remains somewhat comical,"I LOVE this movie. If you have not seen it, and are willing to ignore the critics reviews... rent this movie! If you want a catchy little phrase to put on your desk in the office or hang on your refrigerator... find one in this movie!"
5,A modern down to earth Fairy tale,"I really liked this movie despite some negative reviews I read recenty about it. Yes, MAYBE the characters were not fully develloped, and MAYBE the actors were not used to their optimum...But you have to love the way in which this movie takes you to a far away, and Yet existing land of dreams.The actors transmitted the message of the movie in such an amazing simple and direct way. Ione skye was (in my opinion) superb and her character (plus her great looks) was very attractive.Even though Aniston's part was not a big one, but it sure was her best so far (excluding the series friends of course).It's a movie about dreams and hopes.It's a movie about love and friendship. And most importantly, its great to finally see a movie where the actors make the actions instead of 3D computerised special effects.Original and Great, Dream for an Insomniac is in my opinion A Must See!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie seems to want to be very artsy and intellectual, but really isn't. Ione Skye's (Frankie)character is frankly unlikeable, she is a self involved bore who seems to be living on another planet from the rest of her friends. Mackenzie Austin (David) is likeable enough, and for a while displays some strength of character by sticking with his girlfriend, but of course by the end of the movie he falls for Frankie, though god knows why, as she does not show a single redeeming character trait in the whole movie. You could just picture them 5 years later, and her heading for the door because ""the passion is gone"".The only really likeable character was played by Jennifer Aniston, but it was a waste of her time too, and you have to wonder why David didn't notice her, as she is twice the gal Frankie is."
2,Jennifer Aniston,"I didn't like this movie, maybe because of Jennifer Anniston and her lack of acting abilities."
3,FAIR,I AM A JENNIFER ANISTON FAN THAT WAS THE REASON FOR MY PURCHASING OF THIS MOVIE. I FOUND IT SLOW MOVING AND UN-INTERESTING
4,"Girl wants boy, boy however has a girlfriend","Franki played by Ione Skye has Insomnia and lives in a world of black and white until she meets David, played by Mackenzie Astin, the new employee in her uncle's coffee shop where she works. Franki has impossibly high standards for her love and fears that she will never meet a worthy man.Until David steps in that is. Franki and David click immediately--untill Franki discovers he has a girlfriend. Undaughted, she moves to L.A. with her best friend Allison played by Jennifer Aniston. She only has 24 hours to make him fall in love with her. Sure that he will dump his girlfriend and follow her she puts all her faith in fate and hopes for the best. I thought the movie was a great first attempt by DeBartolo and if you are up for a kind of hip '90s love story this is the film to see."
2,Dream For an Insomniac,"This movie starts in black and white. I am not a person that likes that unless it is a classic movie. The story line plugs along slowly, with the always predictable ending you could see coming for a half hour."
3,Great for all you hopless romantics!,"Unfortunately, I have read numerous terrible reviews of this movie but, I have to disagree with them. I understand that this movie lacks in many aspects when comparing it to the ""big budget"" movies of the day and that the ""movie reviewers"" have an obligation to trash movies that aren't complex both technically and script wise. I feel in love with this movie and since first watching it 6 months ago, I have showed it to over 20 people...all who have fallen in love with ""Dream for an Insomniac"". The movie is perfect for all of you hopeless romantics who are wishing upon that star for your soulmate to enter your life and ""make everything wonderful"". Who cares if it isn't realistic!!! Sometimes we all need a little magic in our lives...that's where movies come in."
5,for the closet romantics,"I found this movie to be sweet, charming and hopeful. If you like quotes it might just steal your heart since the the ""meet cute"" scene entails the leads wittily quoting back and forth at each other. The characters seemed like they might have deserved more plot, but were none-the-less intelligent, in the oh-yeah-I-know-someone-like-that way, even if you don't. Although this movie isn't nessesarly for everyone I highly recomend it.(If you would like to see the lead characters in a more highly developed plot I direct you the director/writer's book, God Shaped Hole.)"
5,For all the dreamers who don't think they'll come true!!!!!!,"If I had to pick a movie that best described my life story, I would have to say Dream for an Insomniac. It was a witty, thoughtful, intense, and captivating movie about dreams. We all have them and some of us settle for less than we had imagined. Skye and Astin have defineate chemistry in this movie and they allow the audience to believe in fate, destiny, and the pursuit of happiness. I have already seen this movie three times and will defineately see it again. I honestly don't do that either!!!"
5,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time !,I simply loved this movie. It seems like this movie falls into the viewers choice catagory. I have no idea what the critics find so feeble about this film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who's grown sick with the latest batch of debris thrown from Hollywood.
5,Excellent Movie!,"This film is one of my personal favorites, and I loved Ione Sky's performance in this movie. She is truly talented! I enjoyed the music throughout this film, since I am a jazz fan. Great romance film that is wonderful! I absolutely love this film! You won't regret it!"
5,"Witty, Visually Stunning, melted my heart <3","What can I say about this movie other than I loved it. The acting was natural. Mackenzie Astin as Ione Skye's love interest reminded me of someone I used to be infatuated with, only in the movie I could vicariously live through Frankie (Ione Skye) and get into his heart. Skye's classic beauty and grace was refreshing. This movie absolutely took my breath away. Its the only film that makes me smile every time I watch it."
5,"Deep, romantic, with undeniable warm-fuzzy feelings.","Clever, Witty, Deep but bright, fun, and romantic. I think that there is a little bit of an insomniac in all of us, just waiting up for our dreams to come true."
5,never sleep again,"This movie may not be the best but it's the greatest. I long to be this woman,(Skye) she only wants what she wants and doesn't settle. ""Settle for anything and you're doomed."" It fits so much."
5,worked for my E30 BMW,i purchased this for my 1990 BMW M3 which uses a sealed beam headlight. This works fine and lights up the road as any car back in the 80s and 90s would...don't go expecting LED or HID technology from this sub 10 unit.
5,great,the headlamp fit the car perfectly and makes it so you can see a lot better as it is so much brighter that the original bulb.
2,Hobby knife,"This an extremely well made knife, but the description is misleading. The padding is nothing more then a grip, and is not suitable for long use. If you build models this is great. But this is not the knife for a paper cut artist like myself who spends hours cutting."
2,Not interested...,My son usually plays with all of his toys. But this toy failed to grab his attention when I purchased it at 8 months of age. Now he is 15 months and he ocasionally throws it on the floor as he is searching through his toy basket. I just didn't think this toy is well suited for him.
2,7month old not interested,"I bought this for my 7 month old daughter thinking she'd like the sounds and help her learn to stack the toys. She doesn't want anything to do with it. She sits on her own and loves to reach & grab things while she's sitting but she hates these and won't even play with them. If I could, I'd return them to the store since it was a waste of money in our house."
4,A good early stacker,"I got this for my daughter when she was 5 months old, and it does keep her interest. She likes to chew on the soft 'antennae' that poke out the top of each piece, and the antennae help her pick them up, even though she can't stack them yet. The one thing I would caution is that although the top piece of the stacker is covered in soft fuzzy cloth, the faces on the bottom 2 pieces are plastic. There is also a plastic lip on the bottom of the top piece, which, before she had good arm control, I was worried she would bonk herself with."
5,Catch That Train!,Awesome cover daugther even payed with it like it was a trainShe has dance/music parties with her friends and all sing a long and danceItem in good condition
3,A kids tune.,I was hoping for more then just one video of the sounds and the videos that were shown on TV. It is ok but not 100 % of what I had expected.
4,"great quality,fun cd!",Love this cd and so does my son. Every song is great! Very funky and laid back.great for adults and children. Unique packaging with guitar chords for the musician
5,good for everyone,Some kids music is rather annoying for adults. This album is very enjoyable for everyone. My husband and i like it as much as our kids do. Dan Zanes and They Might Be Giants are some of our favorites.
4,Nice!,"There are catchy beats and neat lyrics! The syle needs to be your taste to really get into it as an adult, but the kids seem to love it."
5,Wonderful CD,"My daughter loves watching Dan Zane, so we decided to buy the cd. It was a great price and we are all enjoying it."
5,my toddler loves Dan Zanes' songs,"My son loves music and really likes Dan Zanes. We started with the videos on Disney and the ""catch that train"" song really got us singing, so we ordered this CD. Now my son sings along with it, dances and jumps around. Dan Zanes really is fun for the family."
2,Don't think this book is the solution,"I've only read about 30 pages, but already I am not satisfied with it. What is this about Jesus somehow being too shy and affected by the labels given to him by those in Nazareth as the reason why He could not perform miracles there? Since when did Jesus become discouraged by what others said of him? I read this book because I am very very chronically shy to the point where I am depressed half the time, but I'm not so gullible as to be pampered by comforting words that are clearly out of line with what I think to be the true meaning of a passage. In other thoughts thus far, I think the author is trying to target too wide an audience, giving it a rather impersonal tone. I will finish it nonetheless, for hope that it bring some advice to me, but truly I think the solution for you and for me comes from a life of prayer and patience and acceptance for who God has made you and believing that He loves you."
3,"Cute, but Roar a little scary","Puppet is cute, but the roaring sound is not what you expect, very vicious sounding."
4,Mansion Builder,I thought the service was very quick and the product in great condition. I love the music and was happy to find it on CD.
2,Make My Life A Prayer.,"I know that this isnt what i typically listen to as it is a lot slower and a lot of harmonies. This is one of their best selling albums but I just couldnt get into the harmony church music of the early 70s. I do love the lyrics and the sing ing of ""Make My Life A Prayer"" a Keith and Melody Green song. A great Cd for people who like this type of music but it just wasnt for me."
2,Save your money,"A forgettable remake. Obviously a made-for-TV movie. Whoever edited this as well as whoever approved it for DVD should go back to film editors school. I agree with the reviews that disliked it and for the same reasons. Please save your money for the original with David Niven. There is simply no comparison. BTW, the only reason I gave it 2 whole stars is because of the actors and I am being generous at that."
2,It is okay.,"Due to no closed captioning, I was playing it in fast forward. But it is very entertainment."
2,80 DAYS?...felt like 800!,"I so much wanted to like this presentation, but(t), alas, I can't. Five minutes into it I began to genuinely dislike P. Fogg and hoping that he would FAIL in his endeavor (Everyone should be very happy not to know such a personality). And the length of this exercise, O My! Everyone would have been well served if a native stopped him, half way around the world, with his trusty bow-'n-arrow."
1,Great Movie - Terrible Video Quality,"My family recorded this mini-series off the television when I was young and I enjoyed watching it every so-often as I grew up. This is a great version of the story and Pierce Brosnon as well as the rest of the star-studded cast perform wonderfully. However, I had to give this DVD a 1 star rating because of the terrible video quality. It looks like it was recorded from a bad VHS copy by an amateur home video enthusiast. The coloring is dark and blurred, the audio is terrible and there are even the occasional ""wrinkled-tape"" lines that pass through the picture. I am sorely disappointed by the quality - I could have gotten the same (or better) by digging out my parent's old VHS recording."
2,Lost a lot of fun!!!,"I watched the same film in VHS few years ago.It was very impressive and had a lot of fun.But after I got this DVD, it really disappointed me!!A lot of scenes have been REMOVED: just like the chapter in China, Japan and India.And that part(saving the princess) has gone also.If this is a miniseries, I guess they really didn`t have an idea about when and where to cut it!!!"
1,"Lousy, Stay away","The dvd arrived on time and undamaged and that is all the good part. This is my second try at buying a used copy of this dvd; and I got burned each time. This dvd, without any doubt in my mind is a very poor, no, make that lousy copy. Very dishonest. My advice is stay away from any used copy of this dvd, there are just no good used sources for this dvd. I will buy the real macoy from a reputable vendor, after throwing away nearly $14 bucks to these unscrupulous vendors. If the rating system allowed me I would have rated it zero stars. Stay away from a used copy of this dvd."
4,What a treat for the romantic in each of us!,"Phileas Fogg is more real, more human in this version than in the 1956 version played by David Niven. I found the action, coupled with the constantly changing pieces of the plot kept my attention better as well. It's still a long epic, but worth the viewing.I enjoyed the developing humanity and tenderness of Phileas Fogg as he struggles to break with his stiff, English background and allow himself to love and express that love to Aouda, the Indian princess.Excellent for the incurable romantic."
5,wonderful adventure,"I saw this movie on TV when it originally aired. This is my favorite role for Pierce Brosnan. He does so much better with this ""adventurous but uptight English gentleman"" type than the ""James Bond"" type of role. It has a magical quality and is quite beautiful to watch."
1,Great Movie - Horrible Video Quality,One of the most entertaining movies made! The best portrayal of Jules Verne's classic!Pierce Brosnan is great in this film!The DVD looks like it was copied from a VHS tape! It looks as bad as some of the stuff I have in my attic.Great entertainment value. But the video quality is crap!
2,AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS,"This was a TV miniseries that we had video taped when it first aired. Every now and then we watch it, but our tape was so bad I decided to see if it was available on DVD. I found two versions and decided to get the least expensive. This version was ok, but the quality of the recording was not as good as most. The picture seemed fuzzy and dark. We still love the movie, but were a little disappointed in the quality of the DVD. I don't know if the other DVD out there would have been better quality."
2,VHS on DVD - Why do they bother?,"I loved this series when I first saw it. How wonderful for it to be on DVD at last! But wait, what's this? Dark... grainy... tracking glitches... The DVD looks like it was transfered from a much rented VHS tape. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one, it's painful to watch. Wait for someone to release a 'clean' version and let this one fade away to nothing."
5,Excellent,I am thoroughly impressed both with the technique and the production of my Converational Japanese in Nothing Flat course.The format is so simple that even someone like me with no language experience in Japanese whatsoever is able to learn to speak the basics fairly quickly.It's very practical too.
3,Hmm.. it's okay,"The story line is a little atypical which makes this book interesting. It is set in Leadville, Colorado (which is a real town). At first I was drawn to the book because Leadville is a place my family has visted many times in the last 15 years; however the mystery element in this book borders being gross (dead rats stuck to someones door with a knife) and really the only true parts of Leadville discussed are in reference to the Silver discovered deep in the ground. The book contains questionable morals and isn't a book I would have been happy to pay money for."
5,silver lies rings true,"I read a lot of historical fiction and i am annoyed by poor research, this was not a problem with Silver Lies. The characters were well developed, the mystery, or should I say mysteries kept my interest. I lived in Leadville for a few years, walked the uneven sidewalks on Harrison, ate and drank in the 100 y ear old plus buildings. The authors portrayal of Leadville inwinter is spot on. Even the detail of Inez`s baby not thriving due to breathing problems is accurate. Even today babies born to. Mothers who live year round in Leadville tend to be onthe small size. Instead of talking about the baby rolling over or sleeping through the night new mothers talk about the baby being taken off oxygen. So read the book it will give a good idea of the conditions in 19th century Leadville and entertain you with a well written mystery set in a mining boom town. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
2,Badly written,I struggled to finish this book. The plot and story are great but the writing is poor and often not engaging.
3,"it was okay, rather long and ""wordy:.",Seemed like it took forever to get the story read. Did not especially enjoy the characters. It was just okay.
4,Great atmosphere,The imagery of the era and location were great. You could imagine the cold and what life was like in those early mining times and the story had some nice twists and turns.
2,Didn't hold my attention,It started out all right but I was only able to get about 30 pages into it before giving up because I didn't have enough liking for the story or characters to continue. I even read the ending to see if that would keep me going but still didn't get any further.
2,It's OK,"I finished this book because I did want to find out who the culprits were, but it seemed to take forever!I have a friend who lives in Leadville so that attracted my attention. I like mysteries and I like strong smart women protagonists but this book only had one of those two things.I never could warm up to Inez. She just seemed too stubborn, proud, stupid and easily influenced by any man who paid attention to her."
3,interesting story,"First, there is a spate of very graphic violence in the prologue that almost turned me from the book completely. After that, though, it wasn't bad in that respect.What was bad, though, are the multitudes of mistakes, mostly of the ""could of"" sort (locations 3858, 4146, etc.). The story itself is OK but isn't the best I've read."
5,Silver Lies,"Great writing. This WILLA winning title puts the reader in the middle of mud, snow, and murder with word pictures that will tickle your imagination. If you love plots that revolve around strong, empowered women, Ann Parker's pistol-packin' Inez Stannert is the woman to have on your side. Definitely an enjoyable read."
3,silver lies,"took awhile to get into this book to many characters in the book and it took me a bit to remember who was who, but once I got into I did enjoy it, but I must say it took intil chapter 18"
2,Wanted to like...,"I really wanted to like this book. I was in Leadville this summer & I thought it would be a fun read. Got about 15% into the book and had to put it down. Hopefully, when the weather is freezing and there is nothing left to read I can try and get back into it."
2,Disappointing,This scale appeared online to be just what I wanted. The size and basic design turned out to be just fine. The disappointment lies in the quality of the measuring device itself. The component that determines weight is cheaply constructed so that you're never quite sure exactly what your food weighs. Each time you rest the top container on the scale to set the weight to zero you get a different response from the scale! This is not the scale for someone who must get exact results.
5,History lesson,"It's very interesting. It tells how Mexicans grew up in Texas, so if you want to know more on how Texas was made this would be a good book."
5,Meaningful Social History,"I read this book some years ago (about 1994 or 5) and it stays with me every day. What Montejano has done for Texas in telling its social and racial history sheds light into the complex contemporary tensions of the southwest. He skillfully uncovers the racial and class subordination of people with Mexican ancestry. I found this book to be extraordinarily enlightening and useful in interpreting California history. What he does best in the book is isolate the racism of Anglos in the Southwest targeting Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. If you're looking for a quick snippet to get a feel for the book, I recommend chapter 10 on ""Segregation"". I can only hope that Montejano will grace us with more books."
4,Sorry to see them go.,It is a shame this line was cancelled. My six year old has several in this series and loves building and exchanging pieces between the differant sets.
1,Did not hold my 10 inch mixer,"Ordered the CBM10. Got it and everything looked ok until I tried to put my mixer in the case. Please be aware that the well width for the mixer is only 9.25 inches. I wish this listing had specified that, because I wouldn't have bought it. Also, it shows additional foam in the turntable recess, and there was none in my case. It really looked like I got the case of the CBM10, and the inside of the CBM10E. I am returning the case and am really disappointed."
5,Dieting Out of Control,"I have a lovely child who started dieting several months ago and never did I think she would be ruled by obsession. I could not believe what was happening, and how quickly the problem took hold. Then, I heard about this book and there it was, every one of the personality traits and social stresses the book discusses as early warn signs. For weeks I was doing things that I know now were not helping, even making things worse. Things really started turning around when I followed the suggestions in this book. I only wish I read it two months ago. Thank you Dr Strober and meg Schneider!!!!!"
1,Design Defect Makes Unusable,"I knew this cable was on the ""economy"" end of Monster's product line, but I expected it to nevertheless be a quality product due to the Monster name. The cable simply doesn't work. Because the terminals are not ""split,"" they do not hold tight on the connections on the video component. You put them on and they just slide off. This was the case on both a new DVD player and a cable box, so it wasn't a question of the video component being out of spec. Monster should pull this off the market and fix the design defect."
5,Great Product,"Received the Monster Component Video Cables in record time, opened it and plugged it into my tv and DVR. The picture I receive now is excellent - so much better than with the RCA cables"
5,"Klay Scott's time is here, spread the word!","Klay Scott's past experiences in the Christian market may have done him more harm than good, but with an amazing CD such as Celldweller, it's going to be difficult to deny him his rightful throne as the King of Industrial. Easily Trent Reznor's equal (BETTER, in my opinion), Scott's not gotten the recognition and airplay a talent of his calibur deserves. It's time for that to change.Instead of stringing together a bunch of blips and bleeps and other techno-noises, Klay creates actual SONGS, and he fine tunes them lovingly until they're near perfection. ANY fan of the industrial/metal scene should give this a listen. Those in doubt ought to head over to mp3.com and listen to some samples of his work, you WON'T be let down!"
4,Strong album from an artist who doesn't get enough attention,"I fist found Celldweller by accident on MP3.com a little over a year ago and was so impressed by the songs there that I've been checking his website ever since in the hopes that he'd produce a full length album. It's seems like it's been forever but I'm definately not disappointed in the results.The album delivers a number of strong, well crafted songs giving just the right balance of packed energy and emotion. I didn't give the album 5 stars due to the couple of songs that are too 'aggro' for my taste but the rest of the album more than make up for those."
5,why is this not playing on the radio?,this is some of the greatest rock ive listen to that is not on the radio!!!!try crossbreed as well they are really good as well! Clayton is great! listen to forzen first it is my favorite!!!!
4,Different and Good!,"This CD was recommended by a friend based upon bands that I listen to now (Metallica, NIN, Korn..). He said it was a little different but thought I'd like it. A great mix of alternative and metal. I truly liked the entire CD."
5,Celldweller Rocks,"Such a great sound. It's NIN, Tool, Limp Bizkit all rolled into one! Don't pass up this CD - turn it up loud!"
2,Oh well,"Since the first time I heard Switchback awhile ago, I've been trying to get a chance to listen to the whole album. Man, what a letdown. This album really takes the saying ""Put your best foot forward"" to a new extreme, because after Switchback, you're treated with music that sounds like it could have been written and played Linkin Park, only with a different vocalist. Oh, and with some random interludes thrown into the mix too.Giving it a 2, just because of Switchback."
2,Don't waste your time.,"I've listened to every song on this album, and I have to say, I'm VERY disappointed.All but two songs on this album are boring, generic, teen bopper garbage. The Stars of Orion, and Unlikely (Stay with me) are the ONLY half decent songs on this album, probably because they didn't have Klay's terrible vocals in them. Just those two songs aren't worth the money. Search elsewhere if you're looking for some decent Industrial or Metal."
5,Best CD ever!,"Well this was just amazing. I grew up loving electronica and trance music. Then when I became a teenager I loved hard rock and heavy metal. Then one day I discovered Celldweller. A mastermind brillant music maker Klayton, infuseing electronia with hard rock. Heaven to your ears. All the tracks are great. I couldnt find a track that I didnt like. Even the intro tracks are awesome!"
4,Pretty Good,"this is my first expierence with klayton. i've never heard of him or any of his previous work before i discovered this cd. his songs are pretty good. there is even a few radio friendly songs on this (although i'm sure they'll never get any mainstream radio play). i like techno, industrial, rock, alternative, yadda yadda.. and Celldweller covers all these catagories at least once. some of the songs are long (over 7 minutes) which isnt a bad thing but begins to sound repetive at times. all in all though no matter what kind of music you like i dare say there is atleast one track on this cd you'll enjoy"
4,Good stuff,"Picked up this CD and it has been in my CD player for almost 2 weeks straight (only stopping to switch it out occasionally with Demon Hunter, Living Sacrifice, BB Jay or Disciple's new CD).I've followed Circle of Dust (Buka, Dred, Scott Albert, Klay Scott, Klayton Scott, etc.) since almost the very beginning, when he was putting out Christian CDs - or, as he puts it, putting out CDs on Christian labels. As one person above put it, while I do not agree with the spiritual/supernatural direction he has taken, that is his prerogative, and in any case, the CD ROCKS. VERY good stuff. Some of the slower songs kinda bug me, but just about all of the 1st 10 songs make up for it. Buy this CD. :)"
3,Could Do Better.... From a Pro. Framing Carpenter.,Because pouches are widely attached at each end....contents spill when crouching or bending. Contents of large nail pouch partially blocked by immovable tape pouch. More stitching needed on quick square slot...as mine quickly unraveled leading to second nail pouch droop. Would Not buy again.
3,bad vinyl quality,"Music excellent, but product .... On february 2 I received ordered LP Tom Waits from Amazon.com. Vinyl had absolutelly wrong quality with scratches, old clue dust, on both sides. This is my second very bad experience with amazon."
3,Not nearly as good as Rain Dogs & Franks Wild Years,"Don't get me wrong, there are a couple gems on this recording, but it fails to have a flow. Everytime I think about how mediocre this album is I have to remind myself that this was a major move for Waits and he was still experimenting with this sound. That is why I give it 3 stars, it is a remarkable change."
2,"long-term fans, get it; newcomers, get the others first.","I've been a major fan of Alan Parsons since first catching hold of ""Tales,"" twenty-some years ago. In the post-Woolfson era, Parsons has shown that he can still manage the big ideas, the big songs, and, of course, the big production that makes his projects so wonderful. I think of the anguish in ""Oh Life (There Must be More)"" from ""Try Anything Once"" or the beautifully executed album ""On Air."" This latest disc, however, does not spin so well for me. I am willing to say that perhaps Alan (or Ian, as the case may be) is going for subtlety here, but this whole album strikes me as music to fall asleep to. When I want Enya, I'll get Enya. I want Alan Parsons music! That said, the production is, of course, impeccable, and there are moments when one can glimpse the former glories of Alan's musical output. Long-term fans must get this album. Newcomers should steer clear until they have digested the rest of the catalog."
3,Where is Alan Parsons????,"Granted, Alan Parsons did engineer and produce the album, but he barely plays on it and has no songwriting credits. Considering that the band is called Alan Parsons, I am quite suprised. TIME MACHINE and ON AIR are lackluster efforts. TRY ANYTHING ONCE proved that APP can make good music without Eric Woolfson. Don't get me wrong, TIME MACHINE is still better than most of the mindless junk out there. However, given the high standards of musical excellence I expect from APP, I was a little disappointed. This really is an Ian Bairnson solo album. As a side note, the song ""Far Ago And Long Away"" samples the same music that Steve Vai sampled on his ULTRA ZONE album on the song ""The Blood and Tears""."
4,It grows on you,"Alan is back, and the polish is there. I just wish there were more of him...I mean Parsons. This seems to me mainly an Ian Bairnson/Stuart Elliott piece. Not that this is bad, not at all, but I mean Alan hardly lifts an instrument here...or so it seems. He's only credited once, and that for the organ. Come on! More Alan next time. And one more little gripe. Chris Rainbow as back up singer only. Back up singer? Come on!The songs, though, soar. From the opening (on the American release)The Time Machine Part I and onto the magical Out of the Blue, which for my money is one of the best AP(P) songs ever. I also like that Parsons has gotten back to using women on his albums again. Call of the Wild and The Very Last Time are quite good.Overall the album is good, though not as good as either Try Anything Once nor On Air. But it's good, and that's enough with Parsons. His good is better than a lot of bands' great. I hope that Parsons doesn't waste time bringing his next album out."
3,Alan Parsons - Not One Of His Best,"Parsons and company take on the concept of time travel on this one. Overall I find this to be one of the weakest albums in my Parsons collection. I find a lot of it on the bland side and although there is nothing that is outright horrible there is a not that is memorable either. Probably my favorite song on the album is also the longest one called ""Ignorance Is Bliss"" which has some very nice instrumental work and vocals. Other than that it is all fairly pedestrian. This is not a bad album and Parsons fans will probably get some enjoyment out of it, but to me it ranks about on the same level as ""Eve"" in the Parsons catalogue."
2,What a disapointment,"Let me preface by saying that I am huge Alan Parsons fan. On Air was an amazing concept album. The Turn of a Friendly Card, Ammonia Avenue, Tales, and Vulture Culture were incredible. My biggest disappointments to date were Eve and I Robot, which are still listenable.And then came the Time Machine. Worst album they've put out so far. The best word for it is 'flat.' The opening track is the only one with any energy at all; the rest simply meander from note to note without any feeling of development or progress, let alone excitement or other feeling.Even the lyrics are flat. The concept behind ""Press Rewind"" had a lot of potential, but the music didn't live up to it. And the lyrics of the others were mostly bland platitudes. It's a sad day when the most insightful words are the voice-over narration by Professor Frank Close in Temporalia.I'd come to expect much more out of Alan Parsons."
5,Simply Gorgeous !,"This is the first Windham Hill compilation I've purchased in a long, long time, and I am thrilled with the music.The artistry is stunning, the artists bring themselves to the music while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the original piece.My favorite is Grieg's Nocturne, arranged and performed by Steve Erquiaga. I have been in love with his music from the momentI heard his CD ""Cafe Paradiso"" (Imaginary road Records). It is absolutely stunning!When I saw that he was on ""Adagio"" I went for it. I'm so happy that I did ...Other hightlights for me are Philip Aaberg's ""Adagio for Strings"", Tracy Silverman's ""Arioso"" ..... they're all beautiful.Thank You for this wonderful music."
4,Rational Thoughts,"Sir John Mortimer is an extremely literate and honestly open-minded person who writes with a flowing exquisiteness of the English language. This small book of his thoughts on a good life is a reminiscence of the life he has led and is still leading. He mentions a lot of classical literary authors and their characters that would further enrich a person's knowledge. Also, the various types of people he met working at the Old Bailey has surely enhanced his art of observing and putting their perspectives onto paper. Together with wild imaginations of his, no wonder his many writings are keenly absorbed by the public. The last ten chapters are my favorite but in each I find something to laugh out loud about. This is his own story and the way he tells it is invigorating. In not so many words in each section, he still succeeds in relaying his message that is predominantly deliberate."
2,Did not meet my expectations,"I am afraid I was quite disappointed in this book. The review in the Times that I had read made it sound like a much more profound and important book - one I would like to own rather than just take out of the library. I had previously enjoyed other books by John Mortimer, but this book was just a collection of random musings which did not hold together at all."
3,Willful Thoughts,"To my mind, John Mortimer's small book providing his reflections on life is an uneven effort. Sophomoric humor on trifles is often interposed with the more message driven treatment of serious subjects. His thinking on current international political events is from the perspective of a man faintly annoyed that the USSR of Michael Gorbachev did not last. While his thoughts on the good life are at times at odds with my thoughts, this is Mr. Mortimer's gift to the next generation not mine."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I agree with the others who say not to buy this product! I would give it negative stars if I could.It is a total scam and the information it gives you is totallydependent on your cycle length and nothing else. It is innacurate and VERY misleading. I was so hopeful when I bought it, butonly after several cycles did I realize that it was not really using any biological data. It is a total waste of money and I amvery angry at having wasted mine!"
1,With the lady that said don't waste your money,Its true she couldn't have said it better. No wonder I was confused all the time. Big regret buying this. Too much work for this monitor. Does no work and leaves u still wondering. Big waste ? FYI I used the sensor too.
4,Good device but watch for who you buy it from,"This product is very easy to use. It just takes 10 seconds for the oral sensor reading, and about 30 seconds for the vaginal sensor reading (depending on how fast you can insert the ""little-finger"" size sensor into the vagina).This is a very good product. However, be careful of who you buy it from.It was a mistake that I bought an Ovacue with vaginal sensor from HealthCheckSystem. HealthCheckSystem sold me an opened box (or refurbished) as new. These items are very personal. How can they advertise it new, but deliver it with an opened box (came in with a brown box, not in a retail package)? If you have a choice, don't ever buy it from HealthCheckSystem."
4,"Good quality, not long enough","very good quality as expected, not long enough but it works, plugs in easily, gold connectors, little signal loss. :)"
4,Good Y adaptor,Works well. No comments on performance since I have no way to compare the performance.
1,it was what i needed and it was cheap *UPDATE*,"my subwoofer had a left and right audio inputs so i bought this cable for a very reasonable price. no point in shelling out any more than $10 for a cable...ever. doesn't matter how good the build quality is. as long as it has gold connectors, you're good to go. my cables are never going to need superb build quality because they're never moving.************************************************************************************************well i moved my subwoofer back a little and it BARELY hit the wall. one of the connectors broke inside my sub and now it won't work. BEWARE! cheap build quality!"
3,snug connection,"If you are looking for a splitter that is snug and well built, then these monster y cables do the job. A little expensive, but for home theater or other applications they are reliable."
5,good cable,This cable performs as described. I have no complaints. I use it to connect my Pioneer Elite VSX-21TXH receiver to my Klipsch KSW-10 subwoofer.
5,Monster does it again!,Bought this because I've used Monster products for years. Mainly started using them in Automotive audio setups and was never let down. Because of this I gladly use their products in my home audio/home theatre setups. Can't go wrong with this product!
5,"Oh, my, what these boys have started. . .","Before rap and metal merged into the bastardized, left-on-the-doorstep stepchild it is today, Anthrax (heavily influenced by rappers Public Enemy, Run DMC, and other old school rappers) decided to release ""I'm The Man,"" a goof they played at concerts from time to time. They updated it somewhat on their ""Attack Of The Killer B's"" CD, and it certainly sounds more polished, but the original is still the best, and always brings a smile to my face whenever I listen to it. While ""I'm The Man"" is a decent goof, the f'ing cranking live versions of ""I Am The Law"" and ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" are what makes this a 5-star recording. Possibly the best live Anthrax captured on tape!"
5,Ur all I need,"I love Anthrax. I'm the Man is the only thing you need in this life. Better than the Beasties and the title says it all, ""I'm the Man, Brother!@###$"""
2,Mediocre as counting books go,"This book is really nothing special unless your little one is wild about Maisy. It's a simple counting book -- ""One ladybug, two flowers, etc."" However, the counting items are not featured on the page. And some of them are downright hard to see and count, like 7 steps (on a slide). The pictures are nice and bright and colorful, so two stars for the overall illustrations, but as a counting book, this is very weak. I like ""10 little ladybugs"" myself. My toddler was counting to 10 at about 14 months..freakish actually, because she liked to pick this to read with my husband and count the VERY easy to see, raised ladybugs on the pages."
2,Not the best counting book,"While my toddlers love(d) Maisy, the counting of items is not very easily followed by those with 20 second attention spans. For example, to count 4, there are four itsy-bitsy, very small paint splotches on a paint palette Maisy holds. Or for 10, you have to count 10 small black fleas against the gray background of Eddy the Elephant's skin. As much as I love Maisy, I'd get another book for counting. Don't get me wrong, we have at least 12 other Maisy books. This one isn't one of the better ones."
5,historical footage,"OK, it's a hokey not-very-good movie BUT there are many scenes of the bulldozing of the ""permanent"" standing sets on the historic backlots of MGM--movie was filmed amid the actual demolitions WHILE they were taking place! Also, there is a cool splicing-in of scenes of these iconic sets AS they were originally seen on film, with clips that compare the present with the past, etc. Sad. Oh so sad, but awesome to witness this historic event--The End Of An Era..."
5,Finally! This movie is accessible!,"1974 was right in the decade of Roller Disco, CHIP's & Battle of the Network Stars so this film was the light at the end of the tunnel. Jack Cassidy is marvelous as the Phantom. Yes, its a TV movie so it could never be a cinematic triumph, however the way the story plays out is very satisfying. I like the fact that people are missing in this lonely dilapidated back lot. They go in...they don't come out! Great atmospheric scenes with the Phantom too. One that comes to mind is when he buries those he has killed in the prop graveyard! Cut a slice of 70's horror and join the Phantom of Hollywood."
5,The title says it all.,"If your penchant is for movie studio backlots (and how well you remember them,) this is for you! It was shot on the vast MGM lot just prior to it's demolition in 1974.The plot is self- evident, but the stars are the lots themselves. It makes a terrific companion to ""The Worlds Greatest Backlot"",released by Amazon late last year.JACK CASSIDY plays the title role and also Peter Lawford (who made many a musical there too) For this reason alone, For me, the movie is priceless.If I had seen the two young louts damaging the lot the way they did, I would have given the Phantom one hell of a hand. Highly Recommended."
3,Bye Bye MGM,"I give this film three stars and that's only for the shots of the old MGM Backlots. If the film was just about that it would get a 5. A silly version of Phantom of the Opea is built around the destruction of a ficticious old Hollywood studio but we all know it's MGM. I'm sure they thought they were just cashing in on the removal of the sets for another quickie TV movie, but what they have done is preserve the moment in time for us MGM Buffs. Thank you."
4,A bridge to Jung for the Tolkien fan,"I read this book a long time ago - in the early 80s - but still remember and recommend it to anyone interested in personality theorists, such as C.G. Jung. Rather than critique its strengths , weaknessed, accuracies, and inaccuracies, I'll describe its impact on me. Prior to it reading, I'd spent a hour or 2 reading about Jung by way of a undergraduate Psych Class. The summer after I read it, I worked my way independantly through the index to and about a third of the text of Jung's collected works, and all of the popular Jung (""Man & his Symbols"", etc) I could find. It drew from love of Middle Earth, introducing me to a larger, equally numinous world."
5,Shakopee Shares Its View,"This book is amazing! I'd recommend it. Some folks might be happy simply looking at the tons of photos of big deer and elk, but I am amazed at the historical information and statistics. Very impressive. And it's a good read for anyone who is interested in Colorado's biggest bucks and bulls."
5,"COLORADO'S BIGGEST BUCKS AND BULLS, Second Edition",I love this book because of all the photos and detailed hunting stories. The book is easy to read because the type is big.
1,disappointed,"I just got these leggings and am sorry to say I am disappointed.The photo is deceptive because it does not show how the waist and hems look.The rubber band is not comfortable around the belly, and my butt looks terrible in them (you know how they show the crease?)!The textile is also of a poor quality.Also too expensive... I expected something of a better quality for this price."
5,the complete book of our solar system,my grandson and myself find this book very interesting and easy to go through. it keeps his interest and anything that will keep him interested so he will learn is a good thing
3,It's Okay,"I bought this as a homeschool book for my son when he was in the third grade.The book came in mint condition.However it is in no way meant for 1-3 grades,more like 1st and the beginning of 2nd grade.It is far to simple for a 3rd grade child.But if you are buying it for a K-1 child then this book is perfect."
4,Very good reel.,"I have had the opportunity to use two of these hose reels. The first one is in our shop and has performed superbly for the last two years-excellent! The second is on a shop rig, and seems to have slowed a bit due to being in the weather (a little oxidized as well), but it still works well. I would rate this reel as a 9.0 on the scale, I definitely would buy another."
5,Spectacular Science Lessons,"This book has fantastic lessons that include graphic organizers along with a hands-on approach to learning. Incorporating picture books with the lessons, it makes the lessons motivating while educating across the curriculum. The book is easy to use and the graphic organizers are ""student friendly"". This book is highly recommended."
5,Awesome Unit!!,"I highly recommend this product. Very simple setup. Get great picture and love that it work with my satelite! Now I dont need 3 receivers!! May order another for kitchen. Order it, you wont be sorry!!"
3,Not bad...,"I owned the original Belkin PURE/AV Remote TV. It lasted 4yrs and I was extremely happy with it...until it died. Fortunately, Belkin honored their warranty and provided me a complete refund at the original purchase price. Unfortunately, they didn't have any replacements or a new model. As a result, I ended up buying this set. I use it to transmit from the Family room to a small TV in the Kitchen. It is probably not the ideal place for a receiver, but it does ok in the room. Microwave and other appliances do not interfere with the signal, but if you walk in front of it the signal will cut in/out (not a problem with the Belkin). You also have to position the antenna just right (also not a problem with the belkin). Other than that, the quality of audio/video is pretty good."
5,5.8ghz wirless audio video sender and receiver,i give this unit 5 stars it works excellent sending TV audio to my PS audio headphone amp and bose quietcomfort 15 headphones the sound is excellent even formusic this works way better then any wireless headphones i have tried.
2,Wireless Sender,"I have the system set to my satellite box and forwarded to an upstairs TV. The TV is about 20 feet from the transmitter. Unfortunately, the signal is weak and does not provide a clear and uninterrupted signal. Buying this product, for me, was a mistake.ps. I have tried all the troubleshooting advice and I have searched the internet, unsuccessfully, for a remedy."
4,"Good product, reception, and very easy to setup...",Easy to hook up and strong reception. The piece that allows the remote to work does not work. It will meet my needs well even though the remote function does not work. Would recommend...
2,Great for Awhile -- but died,"I was initially very happy with my purchase of this product. It arrived quickly, was super-easy to set up, and worked perfectly for the first couple of uses. Then in the middle of a football game, it just quit transmitting, and I was never able to get it to work again. All the lights stayed on, and it looked like it always did, just no signal. I'm in the process of returning it to Amazon right now."
2,Does NOT go through walls,"Contrary to what the description says, this product does NOT work through walls. I have previously used the RF Link system to go through 2 walls. I only switched to this brand because the RF dies after a year or two (I've had two). If you have a simple installation, with no motors or multiple walls between the transmitter and receiver, this may work for you, but don't bother if it's more complex. Whatever product you use, it is important to choose a 5.8 Ghz system since the 2.4 Ghz system picks up interference from remote phones and wireless routers. I guess I'll go back to the RF link and just plan to replace it every year or so."
2,Not omnidirectional antennas,"Difficult to orient antennas- antennas are not omnidirectional and need direct ""view"". I decided to orient later since it took my more that 2 hours to get a basic image and crappy sound. Distance is not more than 10m and have 2 walls in the middle. I am not sure that this was an intelligent decision.I don't have any source of interference but a 2.4 GHz telephone...still can't find the way to solve the problem"
3,Pretty easy to hook up.,We have a boat house that i wanted to get Satelite reception to and used this system to leap frog from our cottage to the boat house. All in all it works pretty good and solved the problem we had getting a picture.
4,All around Great product.,"I've been very satisfied with this product overall. I use it to send my DirecTV signal from my receiver in my living room on the 2nd floor to our Master Bedroom on the 3rd floor. Overall signal strength between floors is excellent. Occasionally, depending on the placement of the ""transmitter"" unit, if you walk in front of the receiving unit, I'd had it break in and out, but never lose signal completely. Its a great alternative to paying for an additional receiver from your cable or satellite provider. (NOTE: If you use this product as I do [in place of another dtv receiver] you can only watch the same channel in both rooms.) Upon setup I did find that this unit does interfere with my 5.0Ghz 802.11n Wireless. Bumping my wireless down to the 2.4Ghz band using 802.11n did the trick and now all is running interference free."
4,Good Quality and Does the Job !,"My Cable was coming in on one wall and my tv was all the way on ther side of the side ,The cheapest solution would be extending a cable , but the distance was almost 50ft if used cable and it would look terrible , plus i have children running around all the time so i didnt want to have any hazards . So i have purchased a similar product before the Nyrius it was good at all for simple reason its 2.4GHz , so i have returned it and i purchased the Nyrius , i have it for almost a month , and its working perfectly . sometimes the picture is not very good if someone standing or passing in front of the tx and rx . but overall i am satisfied with the product and would definitely recommend it."
2,Stopped working after 2 days,"It set up easily, worked like a charm for 2 days then stopped being able to change channels on the television.I suspected that it was a defective IR sender and swapped out with a known good one but no go.Yes it works as a transmitter for the television but I cannot change stations remotely and it greatly limits its usefulness."
2,Just OK,"Great at receiving the picture and sound from the host TV, but doesn't do a good job sending the remote signal back to change the channel. Frustrating to have to get up and go to the other room to change the channel."
5,Transmitter,Works great. Puts a TV where there's no wiring. Signal clear and strong. Had another model earlier that had interference from the microwave (TV in kitchen). This modle isn't bothered. Higher frequency.
1,Don't ask too much from this system,Only use if the transmission distance is short. I have concrete walls and the unit just can't get the signal where I need it
2,"Worked only half way, for a large price...","I recieved this product and realized IMMEDIATELY after hooking it up that it did not work as described. It transmitted signal from room to room DECENTLY, but the IR extender designed to amp the remote control signal was WEAK and apparently NON-COMPATIBLE with my Dish reciever. I contacted Nyrius on the same day that i recieved the item. Convincing me a replacement part or replacement of the entire product would be made in order to resolve the problem, i waited patiently to recieve the part (replacement IR extender). When this part did not work, they did NOT send me a replacement product or even offer a refund, but refered me to R&D and I am still waiting until this day for their solution. I ordered this product 3 monthes ago now...In Summary, don't order this product expecting good customer service, and beware that if it only partially works, there are much cheaper alternatives out that work fine without an IR extender..."
4,Does exactly what we needed,"This is a great wireless product. My house is composed of two buildings and I want to broadcast music from one to the other without wires. The sound quality is excellent and so is the video. I would have rated it a 5 but the range is not as great as claimed. My application is about 50 feet and the antenna direction is very touchy at this distance. It is very line of sight. It did not work at 100 feet but it may be because there is a metal door in the pathway. Once it was set up, it is so cool to have the same music playing throughout the entire house. I will buy more of these."
5,Dan's review,Unit arrived and performed as advertised. Very quick and easy set-up. TV picture and sound are very crisp and clear.Excellent range. Great for applications where running wire is not feasible or when location flexibilty is desired. Highly recommend.
1,GARBAGE.....PERIOD,"LISTEN UP............................Save your money. This antenna / signal extender kit does not work especially for $100.00. Yeah you may get a picture and sound but the quality is terrible. In addition, the quality of the equipment is more along the lines of a $25.00 set and for sure not $100.00. SAVE YOUR MONEY.JUNK!!!"
4,Worth Every Penny!,"It took some time to get this set up so our remote control would work, but once we got everything oriented it worked great! There is interference once in a while(only happened 3 times in over a month) where the picture flickers but it happens rarely and doesn't last long. We just reposition the receiver and it goes away. It is certainly worth the price in contrast to paying for a 2nd cable box!"
4,5.8Ghz Wireless A/v Sender & Receiver,Device worked fine the first time I hooked it up. Transmitter & Receiver are50 feet apart and separated by 2 insulated walls. There appears to be no deterioration in picture or sound quality.
4,very nice! plus shoptronics shipped it out pretty fast,"The product is very good. However, I have charter communications at home and when I used the infrared remote it didn't really work with it. However everything else worked incredibly well. I like how they included an infrared extender which helped direct it to the devices. One downside is that the antennae's have to face the direction of the other devices pretty ""closely"" or else you would hear some static."
5,Great Device,"Works perfect for our old house. The den is adjacent to the kitchen but seperated by a thick stone wall. We wanted a tv in the kitchen while cooking because we are ""news junkies"", (love to cook). Hard wiring would be way too much work(been there, done that). This unit does the job just perfect with our new flat screen sony. The cable set up is in the den and with the correct angle of the receiver and transmitter, ""It's Alive""..... cool."
4,Wireless a/v works well,"The wireless AV sender works well, except for the remote control operation. I use it on Comcast service, with a motorola cable box. It's hard to locate the infrared sensor on the motorola cable box and in all fairness, I think it is the motorola cable box that won't work with the infrared extender. The video and sound quality of the received unit is extremely good as if it's connected directly to the cable box.We are happy with the purchase and value. We had a Terk wireless transmitter/receiver and took it back because it showed a constant white line at the top of the TV. This one doesn't.I highly recommend this one if you're looking for a unit that works."
4,"Good picture, stability issue","Well, these devices are super easy to install, just plug , same ID on touch to the channel button and ur done, picture is good not perfect , am transmitting to 32 LCD tv, and I can say it is 90 % of quality of original source, sound is really good, but devices are too sensitive, in my case the distance between transmitter and reciver is no more than 2 meters, but with .5 meter rock wall thick, sometimes any vibration on ground let's say jumping will corrupt the picture badly and you need to press the channel button to fix,,sometimes you will lose picture on a sudden, but all in all, it's good, and am happy with this purchase, sender is next to 2.4 ghz wireless access point and no noise,,,,finally."
1,Remember Rabbit ears?,"This is garbage! I fussed with the 2 antennas on on BOTH transmitters forever it seemed and all I got was interference. It was like in the old days of trying to watch cable channels that you did not purchase. What a waste. And to top it off this company is in Canada, so I had to fill out customs forms when I returned it. A waste!"
2,Too much static/interferance,"I currently have a 2.6 GHz transmitter with 3 receivers. The microwave interfers with one of the receivers in the kitchen. So I decided to purchase this 5.8 GHz system so that I wouldn't have that interference problem. This 5.8 GHz product has interference on all three receivers, with no microwave being used. The instructions with this system states that the transmitter and receiver should be aimed at one another, and that won't work with more than one receiver (can't aim the one transmitter at all three receivers)."
1,Don't buy it.,"I bought this item based upon the least amount of negative reviews. Unfortunately those negative reviews were very accurate. Easy to set up, but the constant popping and flickering when nothing was in the way makes this device unusable. Luckily, Amazon makes it easy to send back."
1,There is no solution to this scenario,"I bought this unit to replace a 2.4 unit, which had all kinds of interference problems, since this one promised unfettered frequency usage.It really only has to travel up about 8 feet through a wooden floor. The audio has constant artifacts that drive me crazy. It is a piece of junk. Don't buy it."
2,Good for the SHORT time that it lasted.,"This product worked quite well for transmitting AV signals from my cable box to the TV in my kitchen. Until it died. My transmitter just stopped working. After 2 months of owning the unit.Doesn't seem to have a very long life, and that is a frustrating shame, considering the cost.What a disappointment."
2,Wish it didn't interfere with Apple TV,"I have both this and Apple TV box on my TV. If they are both running I get a popping on the Nyrius system, did not get the interference with my last re transmitter."
2,Medicinal Herbal Therapy: A Pharmacist's Viewpoint,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment to me because it left out too many common herbs. Also, it did not give the reactions with medicines, which would have been expected, being written by a pharmacist. I have read better herbal books by pharmacists. Patti B."
2,"Not enough comparison on various ""cures""",I found that although this book has good intentions it was not helpful for someone looking for more then just a list of disease states and various herbals used to treat them. Each disease state lists the herbals sometimes used but did not give any information on why one might be better or worse then the others. It was concise as others have pointed out. I would recommend the APhA book on herbs over this one.
4,Nice entertainment - only one concern,This is a highly entertaining toy and babies love it. Only concern is possible injury from the parts in the event of an accident.
3,Slide along duckies won't sing,"I received the Stroll Along Duckies as a shower gift. It is a very cute toy and neat idea. However, as another poster mentioned, I have trouble with the duckies sliding around the stroller bar. We also had trouble with the music. After a month of use the big duck would only play a couple of notes of the tune, then it would play the rest in a muted, distorted way. We returned it and the second one is ok so far."
4,Thin,"Received this expecting 14 awg wire but I guess it doesn't really tell you what it is on the description. They look more like they are 16 or 18 awg. The wires are very delicate so be careful when you are stripping them. Other than that, the sleeve seems fairly heavy duty."
4,**16 gauge** Monster 100 feet speaker cable,"It was tough to find the actual gauge of this wire and had to do some digging.This wire appealed to me due to:-CCA free-100ft for ~$40-CL 3 rating because i planned on running it under the carpetGranted this is 100ft which is enough to do a 7.1 setup in a small to medium room, i really wouldn't pay anymore than 40 or 50 bucks for it.The outer tube containing the wires is tough to cut through initially to get to the built-in string which then makes it very easy to pull and rip open.I found that with my generic set of wire strippers the 16 gauge worked best, but i did have trouble getting a clean cut.Overall, for less than $50 this is some good wire. Definitely better than the 22gauge crap that came with my speakers"
4,Monster Cable,I must say Moster XP speaker wire makes a huge sound inprovement on mt 6.1 home theater setup my side and rear channels are so clear and crisp .I have these runing threw my walls and ceiling and the intall was a brezz do the jacket by these cables you will love them for your surond speakersWayne mn.
5,good in walls,"The heavy plastic coating makes it easy to run the cable anywhere. Mine is going through drywall and a crack in concrete. And, of course, it helps my speakers sound great. I recommend putting banana plugs on the ends if at all possible. They make hook-ups a lot easier and they ensure a good, permanent connection."
3,Alright.,"Seems alright, gets the job done. I read through the entire description and specifications and couldn't find anything about the cable size but other reviews suggested these are 16 AWG and my wire cutters confirm that too.As was also mentioned in another review. the wires are wrapped around a small plastic tube making them seem bigger so in reality you probably only have 18 AWG of wire. If the wire is actually copper, I think that is fine (and it looks like it is too). But this makes it difficult to use Sewall's Deadbolt Banana plugs because the stupid inner plastic piece sticks out and has to be manually trimmed.The wire works fine for twisting and using in a binding post or clamps.I would not and did not buy these again, just go with a good 12 AWG instead. I bought a spool of 250 FT for the same price."
2,Liars !,If this spool had 100' on it I'll eat my laptop. Was more like 83' When you purchase something online you expect to get what you paid for. Not true here.
3,Too Thick Wire,"Since the price was right on 100 ft of Monster Wire I ordered it. However, this wire must be at least 10 gauge, which the description does not specify. I actually needed to shave down the wire to accommodate my speakers and it is so thick that it does not fit in my speaker stands. I would only purchase this if I was running a speaker with very high resistance and wattage."
4,speaker wire,THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE TRIED MONSTER CABLE. OVERALL IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE. I LIKED THAT THE WIRE IS COMBINED INSIDE THE CLEAR SINGLE TUBE. MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THAT IN STRIPPING THE WIRE. IT APPEARS TO BE ABOUT 15 GAUGE AND MY CUTTERS HAD ONLY 14 OR 16 GAUGE CAUSING ME TO STRIP SOME OF THE WIRE OFF..
3,not about wild food,This book is not about wild or foraged food. It is an interesting book rapidly becoming a time capsule of the era.
4,marco,"A great chef, with great ideas and a strong, british attitude.Ex-Junkie and the First English Chef to be awarded 3 michelin stars. This is the book where he comes off LEAST conceded. Good book, but for the price, Michel Bras' ""Essential Cuisine"" is more for the serious up and comer."
3,Decent speaker wire,"As background, I'm fairly technical and a moderate audiophile. I'm also highly critical of products such as this. In this instance, the product is boring, but in a good way. It is completely serviceable, overall good production quality, etc. Nothing bad about it. Nothing especially good about it either. If you don't need or want flash, and simply want to connect some basic audio elements without much worry for shielding, EM bleed, and other nit picky details of getting perfect sound reproduction, I would highly recommend this as an affordable and utilitarian option."
1,Don't Buy This Item,"First off I bought 2 rolls of this ""50 Foot"" speaker wire because of the low price. This speaker wire is not 50 feet as advertised. It is only 45 feet. I pulled out my tape measure which goes to 50 feet and I held one end of the wire while my niece held the other end and put against the tape measure and it is only 45 feet. This company cheated me 5 feet per roll. 2 Rolls = 10 feet of wire that they owe me. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of speaker wire. This company will cheat you. I will never buy anything from this company again and neither should you."
4,Good For Beginners,"A good book for beginners and average C++ people, it discuss C++ major features and teach you the rules of C++ programming.However if you aim to learn how to develop applications certainly you do not find some aid within this book.Unfortunatly information in this book does not help you design your application using C++. BUT you can use this book as a REFERENCE and I think it is quite good for such purpose."
3,"Flawed, but useful","I bought this book for a class but quit using it when I found it did not have the information I needed to complete the first assignment. The examples roll all the code up into a single file, a style of programming rarely used in the industry. He devotes space to topics not related to C++ such as Extreme Programming. The book contains annoying typos even though it is in the second edition. The explanation of the use of try, throw and catch is extremely cusory.On the plus side, he has a good and lengthy discussion of programming style and good programming practices. If you like involved, wordy explanations, buy this book."
5,"Why, not only how","This book made me understand C++. After first trying with the ""C++ Primer"", where most examples just show how it is not, here I got how it is and why it is the way it is. But it has to be said, that the book goes from C to C++. So if one starts with C++ afresh, it needs some patience."
5,Covers the finer features of C++,A great book which gives examples of how to use the finer features of C++.
5,Complete Refrence,I believe this book is a complete refrence for everyone who wants to everything about C++.
1,This is just awful - I was suckered by the excellence Reich Remixed,"I just assumed that this would be as equally wonderful, and that Glass' music would be even more translatable into the ""trance"" genre, or whatever the kids are calling it nowadays.Sadly, it seems that this was done by junior high kids with a computer and Acid Foundry or whatever that cheap software is.No creativity, and, oddly enough, not even any real sense of Glass' music still being in the ""remix"".I am a huge fan of Glass; I am not a fan of this kind of music, but since I am also a fan of Reich and since, to my total surprise, I am quite enthralled by the Reich Remixed CD, I figured I really needed to give this CD a shot.What a waste. This is totally amateur, but without the occasional genius that some amateur can manage. Strictly, totally, and banal amateur yuckiness."
1,a huge letdown...,"Yeah, it's fun and easy to beat up on remix albums since there are so many mediocre and terrible ones out there... but, wait: here's a great idea... let's give the pioneering, repetitive, trance-like minimalist music of Philip Glass the remix treatment... after all, Reich: Remixed was fabulous... surely the same kind of creativity can be unleashed in this project... But alas, something went terribly wrong here... these are mostly unbearably monotonous, grating, overlong, amateurish productions by remixers who don't seem to even GET (or enjoy?) Glass' music. A real missed opportunity and a huge letdown... ick..."
1,The Ever Recyclable Glass,"This is just another insipid release from the Orange Mountain label, which keeps putting out anything with the Philip Glassname on it - even if it is flagrant garbage. Several releases have been issued which about 90% have the same old songs, just performed by different people. In fact, Philip Glass has become more banal and bovine in the last few years because he knows anything with his name on it will sell to the trendy modernistic music crowd. Overall, I believe it is time to stoprecycling Glass."

5,graet for someone you love or valentine gift,It came within the time period it was promised. the condition was perfect. And the pictures within the book were cute. It is nothing prolific but something fun for a betty boop lover.
3,Doesn't fit the carseat,"This goldfish toy does not fit the carseat. Not safely anyway. When I do manage to get it wrapped around the handle, it hangs down in my son's face. He does like to play with it on the floor. We don't take it with us anywhere. I don't know about other car seat toys on the market, but we are looking and we read the reviews before purchasing."
2,not for a carseat,when i bought this toy it looked easy to attach to the infant carseat. the thing is that it doesnt attach properly. its not big enough to go around the handle. my son and daughter like to play with the fish. its a bright and fun toy. i would just not recommend it for the carseat
3,Not for carseat,"I have to say I totally agree with everyone on that it doesnt fiton the car seat. My 3 month old son loves his play gym with the things that hang down. He could stare and swat at it all day, so I bought this thinking he could do the same while riding in the car. WRONG!! It's not stretchy at all. I wish I would have read reviews before purchasing."
3,Frustrating Fish,"After seeing this attached to my friends babys carseat, we purchased this for our son. We couldn't get it to attach to our Graco carseat. He plays with it sometimes but it was really hard for him to handle for some reason. I know that this toy does attach to some carseats without a problem. Unfortunately for us, it wasn't a good toy."
3,Making a Long Trip Fun,"Fun, colorful, and it makes all different kind of noise. I'm not too sure about having to wrap it around the handle. I think if you have one of those carseats with the circular handle, you wouldn't be able to use this, and it gets crooked and sometimes it's hard to take off and put on. The only other problem I see is that the yellow fish that dangles has a tendancy of hitting my baby in the face when we move the carseat. Other than that, she loves looking at the colors and grabbing for the different toys ... and all of the link-a-doo attachments can be attached, and she loves those things too!"
2,Not For Carseat,I bought this along with all the other link a doo toys and it doesn't attach to the carseat. Everytime I think I have it wrapped on there it falls off when I pick up the carseat. I use this toy when we are playing tummy time.
4,good stuff,"I bought both their CDs after seeing the live show. Both CDs are good, but DANG their live show was so awesome the albums dont quite do em justice. The best 3 piece I have ever heard. The other reviews are right on. its just good stuff."
2,Good but doesn't last long,This is a wonderful device for handicapped and obese people like me. However it does not last long. The handle breaks after a few months use. I have had four and they all have broken.
4,hygiene helper,"25 years after a back fusion I have also developed ankylosing spondyolitus. The combination limits turning and reaching. This tool is easy to use, wash or wipe efforts are easy and complete. It comes with a privacy pouch with easy zipper. The ""buddy"" cleans easily because it is soft vinyl. No more trips to the chiropractor due to twisting to far. Recommended."
4,No Such Thing As A Small Lie,This book was excellent. I learned:How lies can snowball until they ruin lives.Certain crimes are acted upon before they are investigated.You can make anyone seem guilty of anything.And More
4,"Akst almost writes a great novel, but lack of setting makes it only very good.","Daniel Akst bases ""Webster Chronicle"" on the true stories of the big Satanic hysteria in the 1980s involving daycare. It was a scare that ruined many lives. Akst makes uses a fictionized town, when a real place would have been more effective since satanic scares really did happen in the 1980s, even in Massachusetts. Good characters who are appriopriately flawed, and there is doubt in the beginning, but we learn that innocent gestures are turned into dark and sinister ""conspiracies"" by adults who have their own agendas. Good, haunting reading"
5,Great for learning written Arabic,Jane Wightwick and Mahmoud Gafaar have done it again. They really make learning Arabic fun! This book just adds to their Michel Thomas method Arabic Foundation Course and Advanced Course as well as their Conversational Arabic CD set. These are all available on Amazon. It's great to listen to them on the CDs and practice reading with this book.
5,Best Beginner's Book for Arabic,"I have purchased many books to learn Arabic and this one is the best. Although it is more like a high school workbook it is fun and it works! It has english, written arabic, and phonetic arabic - all three are rarely in other books. The games are fun and instill the language further. I highly recommend this book and cannot wait to purchase the next level. Also, the Arabic writing is large enough so that it can be read easily, unlike many other books."
4,not as easy as it made it seem,"The arabic ""examples"" are very teeny tiny and I felt they do not help you as much as it seems. This seems to be the second in a series they do not tell you what the first would be. It comes with a cd and I think what it does not tell you is you should use the CD and practice many times over and over with that first before even trying the work book."
4,Pretty good,I got this book as a present since I want to be a CIA officer and Ihave to buy this book again to learn arabic because I gave it to my sister so she could learn arabic to be in the CIA if directing film doesnt work out. Ismee Daniel!
3,Almost Embarrassed To Wear,"The picture above is much nicer than the product in actuality. It's a good size and the front of it looks fine, but the backside isn't flat. It's concave, which gives it a very cheap look. I am very disappointed. I looked forward to wearing it too much. Now I'll need to find one that looks better. The other products I received from Sabrina Silver I'll rate much higher though."
3,ankh,This silver ankh was a gift and the pendant was great but the necklace was too short for a large man's neck.
2,This is not the WWII version of AOE II!,No building up your civilization and no way to get new soldiers once they are killed. Not even close to the level of AOE II.
2,Not even close to AOE2!,"If you are buying this game in the hopes that it is a WWII version of AOE II, don't! The game gives you a certain number of soldiers and when they are gone that is it, the scenario is done. No build up of troops. No way to get more troops. No chance to defeat some of these missions. It's fun for an hour or so."
2,The game CHEATS!!!,"If there is one thing I hate it is when games cheat. This game gives each unit two range statistics, sight range and weapon range. Playing this game even on its easiest setting, I continually got wiped out by units that supposedly had short ranges. Even my snipers(which supposedly have long vision ranges and weapon ranges) couldn't barely see other units before getting killed. Snipers behind trees were no match for SMG units standing in the open. It was particularly lovely to see artillery out ranged by riflemen! With the cheat code to turn off the fog of war, this game became playable, but you shouldn't need to do that. Also I am tired of games that don't have mission editors. Yes this game is cool because you supposedly have lots of units at your disposal, but that hype means nothing when you don't have the ability to choose. There are much better combat games out there."
4,Real Game for real generals,"Good game for most people love war game especially in WWII. Only one thing can be improved is the Panzer/Tank seens to be too weak at tall. Anti-tank Pak becomes the main role in this game. But for any people who like Air-force, sorry, there is no space to explain, Heers only. On strategy level, this game demands you alot, always think before act. Otherwise, you'll have a BBQ of your troops. In addition, it's a real situation for General like you, cos no production cost or worries on resources. All u need to know is how to use your troops to win. I left only 3 soldiers but still completed the mission. See how cool is it!"
5,Of Mice and Men,"If you are used to getting all the units you want in order to win your missions rushing through enemy ines, stay away from this game. if you are used to self-moving, out-of-scale war machines, stay away. if you are used to not think about tactics, stay away from this game. if you are used to win easily and without effort, you are either very good, or just stay away from this game.if none of the above refers to you, buy the game, get trained in singleplayer, and play this game online. no other game i have ever played beats this game in multiplayer. giant maps, with up to 12 players, hundreds of units you can manage individually or in groups, sophisticated tactical possibilities, and real-time-battle. my alltime favourite, really. and the best of all: rushers and campers never win against good tactics. but thats probably why most of us-americans do not like this game. it's maybe a little bit too complex for fast-food-minds.see you all on th battlefield. Sun Tzu"
1,Don't believe the hype,"Some people sing this game's praises, but the fact is that poor pathfinding, an utter lack of realism (infantry squads can destroy entire tank columns, B-17s fly close air support,...), and brain-dead AI make this game an exercise in frustration for most game players. Players new to gaming might enjoy the game's graphics and large number of available units, but the game's weaknesses will soon wear on them as well."
1,Big Disapointment,"I have my own rule when it comes to buying new games. Never buy the game without playing the demo first. I violated that rule on this one and boy, do I regret it.If you have never played a strategy game before, or perhaps if you have not played anything since the first SimCity came out, this will seem like it's great. But. . . after Starcraft, Age of Empires, and Empire Earth, this is downright pedantic. The graphics are adequate, the AI is terrible, the gameplay is awkward, words are misspelled, navigating the menus is a pain, and the instruction manual is barely enough to get started.If you want to play a good strategy game, get Empire Earth and set it to WWII if that is what you are desperate to play. If you want to play a realistic wargame, get Operational Art of War. If you want to find out how many half-truths can be written on the side of a software box, get this one.I recommend you don't."
4,Love the armor body,Once I put the armor body on the camera case it was like super camera. Great protection for the camera body and I can still operate the buttons with no trouble. The ring around the lense is worthless since it pops off with the slightest nudge and would take the lens cap with it. But the armor body alone is worth the price.
2,This only fits the A100,I bought this for my a200 but it is made fro a a100 even though it doesn't specify this anywhere.
5,Camera Armor - Sony 100,"Rugged, substatial, easy to install, and wonderfully effective in protecting the camera. Every camera should have one of these!"
4,"A little slow, maybe, but good.","I wasn't quite expecting this book to be as wordy as it is--or as slow-paced. My eight-year-old son enjoyed it, though. The illustrations are likable, and there are a lot of good eco-friendly ideas here for kids to soak up. We learn not only about what Minna's family does to be eco-friendly, but about Minna's classmates' ideas to help the planet. There are a couple of activities listed at the end of the book, and I think school classes or maybe Scouting groups could find inspiration here."
4,Great toy for baby.,"I bought this for my Grandbaby, It can withstand the abuse they do to it. It should help her learn quickly."
3,My baby got tired of this quickly,"This is ok...but my baby got really tired of this quickly. He began to find other ways to be entertained by it, such as throwing it..."
3,Not ready yet,"I bought this for my daughter when she was six months old, as the product says it is for, but she never really understood it, so she barely played with it. She liked the colors and the music, but it wouldn't hold her interest for that long. I think this will be better for her when she is a little older."
2,Good idea... Bad execution - Be Careful!!,"I work from home on a laptop often, and my 6 month old loves to play w/my laptop - so I thought this would be a perfect toy for her.She does love it, and bangs on the ""keyboard"" just as she bangs on mine - the lights and sounds are great - love that it has an OFF button - so many toys don't!However, she also loves to bite on anything she can get her hands on - including this toy laptop. While trying to use her left hand to pull the cover down into her mouth, the right hand was caught and pinched between the lid and the keyboard. The plastic is shaped in a way which hurts - even when I closed the toy on my own thumb to test it.I recommend parents do not let their child play with this toy unless you can literally sit there and stare at them the entire time. VTech would be wise to put some sort of safety on the lid of this toy."
3,Cute toy but over-priced here,"My son (like most kids) is totally fascinated by adult laptops - I got this with the hope that he might leave mine alone, but he isn't easily fooled. However, he has spent time being absorbed with this toy. He likes pushing all those buttons, and the movable mouse is nice too. It has 3 modes - the one that plays the music jingles seems to be his favorite. Personally, I don't think it has much learning utility. There are better educational toys out there. But hey, when a kid needs a laptop, he needs a laptop.One more thing - at the time of writing this, the price on Amazon is 39.99, which seems rather steep to me, considering I just bought this for 9.99 at Toys R US. So it might be worth your while to do some comparison shopping before you spring for it at this price."
4,World's Toughest Computer,"I've been saying for a month that I should write a review for this baby laptop. I have a wild 9 month old who likes to push the buttons sometimes but has more fun beating it up, standing on it, walking on it, sitting on it, carries it by the handle, turns it into a see-saw and finds more uses for it every day! We've had it for 3 months and it's still in perfect working condition, even after all the abuse! It's one of his favorite toys. The music never seems to get old to him. The one negative though is that one time, on closing, the lid did pinch his fingers. Didn't stop him from loving his laptop though.. he's even playing with it right now!"
4,Christmas Toy for Toddler Son,"This was a decent buy for the price. It's a little geared more towards babies (age is 6 mos & up), but the next laptop from Vtech starts at ages 3 & up. So, for an 18 month old, this doesn't do the best at entertaining him. It is sturdy (my son has stepped on it a couple times). Recommend purchasing for a 6mo-1yr old."
2,My son wore it out in less than 6 months,"My son got this toy laptop for his first birthday. He really enjoyed the lights and sounds and would play with it exclusively for long periods of time. Then, about a 3 months after we got it, the mouse stopped working. We didn't think much of it since the other buttons were still working and my son didn't seem to notice. Then, one by one, each of the ""keyboard"" buttons stopped working. Eventually, even *I*, as an adult - pushing as hard as I could - couldn't get any lights or sounds to work. My son tried to play with a few more times, but quickly grew bored as it was nothing more than a fancy paperweight. It now sits in the bottom of the toybox in the land of forgotten toys. For the record, my son never spilled anything other than drool on the laptop. We did try changing out the batteries, but alas, nothing worked.If it can't hold up to 4 months of use and a little baby drool, it doesn't seem to be worth the cost."
3,Baby's laptop,"The age recommendation is 6 months - 3 years. I'd stick closer to the 6 months. I got this for my son for Christmas. He wouldn't play with it at all for awhile cause it was boring. Now once in awhile he'll grab it. He likes to point out the shapes and colors but the sounds and lights and ""features"" don't entertain him. He was 19 months at Christmas time and will be 2 soon. Well keep it for future babies around the house, and get him a new lap top for older kids."
2,Watch out little fingers,I just took this toy away from my 9 month old after he slammed the lid shut on his fingers. There should be some kind of safety mechanism in place to prevent this from happening.
3,Ok toy for ok price,I just wish the product did more and said more. Its ok for a beginner learner but i dont put too much educational vaule on it
2,Something might be wrong with it,"There have been several occasions when my little one has suddenly started crying very hard while playing with this toy. After about 3 instances of this happening, I took the toy away because it seemed like it was hurting my child. I don't think a hand got slammed in it because the screen has always been fully open when I've noticed the crying. I examined the toy and couldn't figure out what might be causing the problem, but I won't be using it anymore because I'm not sure if it's safe."
3,My toddler couldn't have been less interested in this toy,"Got this for my toddler (14 mons then) for Xmas, and he couldn't have been less interested in it. It's in his room and he never tries to play with it. I always show it to him to see if he would change his mind, but he looks at it for a minute and moves on to something else. I don't think it's worth the money even though it's not expensive, but I don't see any educational value in it either, I tried playing with it and the noises and the lights that turn on make no sense to me. It's just a silly thing that makes noise and lights up some random squares."
3,So So,"My Son liked the lights when he was two or three months old. But the music didn't play long enough for me to be able to walk away from it. Now that he is seven months old. He can't really play with it, because he keeps closing the lid. It drives him nuts when that happens. When it is open he does like it. But it is not open often enough for him to really get to play with it much."
2,Irritating and mostly useless,"Initially, my son liked pushing the buttons to make it play songs, but the constant pounding on it has made it tweak out. When you started it up, it used to say ""IT'S MY HOME COMPUTER!"" now it just gets stuck in a half loop shouting ""IT'S MY HO! IT'S MY HO! IT'S MY HO!"" and not really doing anything else. it also prompts the child to play with it again after it's been idle for a minute or so. HATE HATE HATE."
5,Great educational toy,"Bright, colorful and plenty of buttons and lights to entertain and hold a 15mo old's attention. I had bought this before for another relative and she enjoyed it so, I thought it would work well again for this little guy."
5,Still a favorite almost a year later!,"I bought this toy for my twins last Christmas when they were almost 12 months, and it is still a favorite. When we first got it, I had to help them a bit (changing the modes, turning on and off, etc.). Now they can do it all themselves, and they are learning to identify all the pictures and sounds, so it continues to hold their interest. They pretty much ignore the ""mouse"", though, and I did have to watch them for not pinching each other's fingers at first (which may not be a problem if you only have one child playing with it). Overall, this toy has brought TONS of entertainment for a very low price - well worth it!"
1,Gigantic FAIL for durability,I bought this laptop and another Vtech noisemaker of doom and both have driven me to make my first online product review.Within a few weeks of purchase the laptop developed a problem. It is constantly looping the sound it makes when you open the cover or turn it on. I opened it up and bypassed the switch but it still has that problem intermittently. Another Vtech toy purchased for my son has the exact same issue.I would have pursued warranty coverage or something of that nature but I would rather just throw it away. I don't see any educational value to it because the button effects are too random (in my opinion). Too much talking for a toy meant for a baby. The playschool tree that you stick a ball inside gets more attention from him.
3,"GOOD TOY ,BUT NO DURABILITY","I bought this toy to my 7 months old son when he is climbing on our laptops.He played with it well he liked the sounds n the poping colors,but with in 2 months it spoiled ,the sound is not coming from the toy,intially i thought may b the batteries are over .I kept new ones , but the sound still is not coming.My son pressed all the buttons for the sound poor thing stated seeing at me.All i say is the toy is good but the durability no."
2,Never captured my sons interest,"The top was too still when he was 7 months old for him to open. Now that he is 20 months old he maybe pays attention to it for 5 minutes at the most. Cute idea, but never held my sons attention longer than 5 minutes, IF it even got his attention. I've put it away, brought it out again, left it in his toy for him to choose from for longer periods. Just never any real interest."
2,Out of Date,"It is out of style. Kids these days know the difference between a laptop and a toy, my Kid wouldnt even touch it. It might have been a great toy in 2006-07, not to today's kids."
4,Entertaining,"My 1 y-o loves this toy. It's very durable and compact. A volume control would be be good, not that it's too loud or too low...would just be a good addition."
3,Lost interst quickly,"Our oldest daughter obsessed with technology so we bought this for her when she was about 6 months old. At first she liked to get her laptop and sit next to me while I was on mine but the novelty wore off quickly. Her favorite part was the mouse and I really liked the volume control because she could sit next to me without it being distracting.One thing to watch out for is the lid. She would sometimes forget to move her hand and slam the lid down. Most children can find a way to hurt themselves with their toys and I don't think that the lid could ACTUALLY hurt her, but pinched and smashed fingers are inevitable.If you can find it on sale it is a great toy to pull out when you need a few minutes to yourself but at full price I find it to be a little expensive for the amount that she used it. We now have a 9 month old that is just learning the joy of the laptop and I am deeply grateful that the mouse is fully attached because she puts absolutely everything in her mouth."
5,Curious son's favorite toy,"Our son is 1 year old and loves to be in everything, all the time. He is attempting to nurture the shortest attention span since records began. We bought this for him when he was 6 months old as his all time favorite is my apple mac, which he cant get enough of (much to the detriment of my lost emails). This laptop comes in a close second. He adores it and smiles every time he sees it. For a child that is tough on everything he encounters it has lasted perfectly through hundreds of drops from his high chair. A must for any curious kid."
3,Cute but basic,"My DD got this as a 1st birthday gift, she loves to open and close it and wiggle the mouse, but she quickly looses interested as the screen doesn't change, and she doesn't have a real ""keypad"". She has a more realistic VTECH bilingual laptop that she enjoys much more (albeit rated for ages 3 and up)."
4,OVERALL GOOD DURABLE TOY FOR YOUR MONEY,"i purchased this from walmart when my son was only 4 months old. At that time, he only showed some interested, now he's 14 mo old and has still been playing with it from time to time."
5,Great Toy,"My little girl is one and this has been her favorite toy since about 6 months. It has 3 settings: music, colors, shapes and she loved hitting the keys to make the music when she was younger and now shes really starting to like to figure out the words. Great toy if you want them to be able to use it for a long time. And educational."
3,I had to take it away from my son.,"My 13 month old son loved this toy, until he slammed his fingers in the lid about 3 times. He's a tough little guy too but he was pretty hysterical! I ended up taking it away from him in the hopes that once he gets a little older he will be able to use it again. I hated taking it away because it's such a great toy, he loved all the buttons and sounds and would leave me alone when I was on my laptop. I wish I would have listened to the other parents' warnings before I bought it!"
4,Pretty Basic Toy,"This toy is pretty basic excellent for six months and up. Not very much to do but for that age the lighs and sound do the trick, on the laptop closes baby has hard time opening. He tries to touch lights verses keys."
5,VTech - Baby's Learning Laptop,"excellent, it is very important to me. I liked the product, it's just as I wanted. and of excellent quality, and precise specifications thanks."
5,Grandaughter's toy,"This Baby's learning laptop was an instant hit with our grandaughter. Upon opening the laptop on Christmas, she immediately began pushing the buttons and dancing to the music. She returned to the laptop time and time again durning the days following Christmas."
5,Great toy!!!,"The reviews on this product encouraged me to buy it. I'm so glad I did, it's now one of my son's favorite toys! I love Vtec! He has several of their other toys too! I HIGHLY recommend this toy, but listen to the reviews and make sure he/she plays with it in front of you. My son sometimes turns it upside down and trys to sit on it and I have to stop him. Otherwise he'd break the top off."
1,Booooooooring,"I bought this and the Fisher Price, this one is going back. There's nothing to it, just buttons and lights, which I guess is fun for a 4 month old, but my 15 month old (and I) got bored with it in 5 minutes."
5,VTech Laptop,"Works perfectly. Looks exactly like the picture. I think it is a great little toy. My daughter isn't head over heels for it unfortunately, but it's a nice little toy regardless. I got just what I expected just not the expected reaction from my little one."
4,Love it.,"We love the laptop toy. Its great for my 9 month old who pushes the buttons, moves the mouse, and opens and closes the lid and all that creates music and flashing lights. She really enjoys it. She doesn't get the education part of it...at 9 months she isn't into listening to anything but the music so we pretty much just leave it on the playing music setting."
4,its great,"I do love this toy .My grandson is only 5m and he can play with it.and my sister twins are 9m and also love it.but I don't think they get the stuff you really can do.they just like to puch buttons and listen to the songs ,it make them want to dance."
2,Shoddy,"My daughter has four electronic Vtech toys and I would not recommend this brand. Within a month of opening each of them, and sometimes within hours, they start to freeze, stutter, often reboot, or get stuck in loops. This makes the toys even more annoying than when they work.For example, this particular toy sings ""My first laptop is so fun, it's made just for meeeeeeeeee, learning all about my home, come along and see!!!"" to the tune of ""Yankee Doodle"" after a few seconds of non-use. Every time my daughter looks away from the toy for a few seconds, I hear this. It gets very old, very fast.Besides that, I see absolutely no educational value in this device or any of Vtech's toys. I'm not fond of this brand and would encourage you to avoid it."
2,A different Junior?,"Okay....I love Junior. He is a true talent. But this CD does not engage me at all. At Twilo I am always amazed by the sophistication of his rythyms & vocals, and his ability to tease you but also deliver the goods. This CD just sounds to me like a bunch of ""hyper"" songs mixed without the Junior flare and punch (is someone going to shoot me for this?). Of course, maybe after another month of listening to it I'll appreciate it.Still love the Future Sound of NY. Thats a CD I can pick years after the release and say ""Wow, there is genius in this!"" And did I hear a Junior mix of Thriller at a club recently? If that was your mix Junior -- incredible."
2,"Disappointing, I regret anticipating it's release","If you have his previous mix cds, you will be disappointed with this release. I have been to all the venues Junior has ever played, and can say that this cd does not compare to his 'live' mixing abilitites. Sure there are great songs, but the mix is far from seamless. A previous reviewer stated that this is the closest to hearing him live, they are wrong. I expected a lot more from this release. If you like great and semi-current house music, this is for you. But if you want a true depiction of his mixing skills, pick up Junior Vasquez Live Vol. 1 & 2. Better yet, I was impressed with 'Scott Henry presents Buzz,' this sounds more like Junior, even though it's not."
3,Alright....,"Being familure with Junior Vasquez, I was a little surprised and dissappointed with the overkill of vocals used. The first cd has some good moments, expecially the first 3 tracks but the quality in the latter part of the cd falls considerably. As for the second cd, I listened to it once, and haven't since. I would recommend any Junior Vasquez cd but this one."
1,"Junior Misses Boat--Without Club/Drugs, He Ain't All That","Being at a great NYC nightclub can be a blast, but listening to Junior's CD at home isn't. Other recent DJ compilations (Ian Pooley and Tranceport's latest, for example) provide a much more pleasurable at-home listening (even dancing) experience. Maybe the CD should come attached with a mind-altering substance. It might work then...."
2,Too much hype. NOT enough meat,I thought Twilo had more respect for themselves. Junior is a has been. And I guess so is Twilo.
1,Ear-bleeding bliss...,"Egomania strikes again as this once talented producer is now more like a chihuahua biting at one's ankles in desperate need of attention. Donald needs to hang it up, as he's a mere fraction of his former self, lost on a blind date with Tina that's obviously taken him down the wrong path of his once illustrious career. Every track on here is either his own latest cheese-ball ""house"" remix of various tired artists or they're his bastardized version of otherwise decent tunes (e.g. Dubtribe's ""Equitoreal"" at a speed only a k-hole victim would appreciate, and only a couple minutes of Kult of Krameria's ""Egocentrik"").Pity as I was really hoping this disc would reflect a true live at Twilo feel, or at the very least show some effort and better selection and overall programming on the part of Jr."
3,An OK album,"Junior isn't the god all his disciples claim he is. But he is a competent DJ - which is why I bought this album just like I did the other two.The first half of Disc 1 is good. Then towards the end it gets a bit too tribal for my taste. An occasional tribal track is OK - but he has like 4 in a row and it gets to be too ""pots and pans.""The second disc is lots of whining-diva [stuff]. And some of them really get annoying. Though Nomad's ""With You"" is a great track.Overall - I wish there were more variety on this disc. Some trance would be nice, but Junior doesn't usually play alot of that. So I can't blame him for not including much. ...."
1,twilo,"I found that while junior keeps me jamin' at twilo weekly, the cd did not keep my attention at all.There is no doubt about junior's talents when it comes to inventing new beats,however the vocals part of the cd set was lacking as his vocals usually are.The vocals should be left to victor c. and peter r.Junior should stick to what he does best.Twilo saturday nights.That is where i find him to be successful.I did not enjoy his last attempt at a cd either."
1,Cheeseball music,"Okay, I read several reviews of this album and I can't believe so many like it. I had never heard Junior Vasquez before, but I had heard from others that he was a talented DJ of progressive trance. I don't care what anyone says, you are only as good as the music you select, even if you mix like a ninja. Almost every song I have listened to defines cheese. From the lyrics (dear god are they bad) to the overall sound. I don't claim to be anything more than a music lover, but this music I have to hate. Stick to the true musicians, like Sander Kleinenberg and Sasha, and leave this clown on the shelves."
3,"Finally, more Holmes, less Rafferty","""Disappearance"" is a big improvement over ""Secret Alliance"". Despite the title, Holmes is present for much of the book. Even better, Rafferty appears very little, and Minnesota is barely mentioned. Unfortunately, Holmes and Watson are apart for much of the story. The villain's conspiracy against Holmes is far-fetched at times, but overall the book is a pretty good story, which could have been better had the author cut down on excessive details and footnotes that do nothing to move the story along."
5,Fantastic.,"I love the .hack series and this was a great addition. The animation was absolutely beautiful, the english voice acting was pretty good, and the plot was pretty cool for something that was so short. That's my only complaint--I wish there was more to watch."
5,Hilarious!!,"The first time I read this book, I was in a lobby...people kept asking why I was crying, and all I could do was hold up the book and quiver. These are short columns, perfect for waiting in line, or while you're on hold. Crazy funny!"
4,Consistently funny - what more do you want?,"A humorous collection from his newspaper column.Every two or three page rant was good for a laugh, and often more than one - what more can you ask from a humour column?Barry is a funny guy, who can take something mildly amusing or ironic in the every day and articulate it into something really amusing. On a particularly good day he even goes a bit surreal.He's consistent (or, at least, selective in this compilation). I'm glad I came across him - I'll be back for more."
5,Dave Barry is way funny.,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm a big fan of Dave Barry, although I think he is much funnier in person."
5,One of his best.,"In spite of the fact that it does not seem, to the best of my knowledge, to conform to the usual format of ""Greatest Hits"" collections, ie it does not seem to be a gathering of excerpts from other books, this does truly seem to justify its title; this is in fact one of the best collections of Dave Barry's humor columns, and I've read almost all of his books and as many of his columns as I've been able to find.On a par with ""Dave Barry Talks Back"", ""Dave Barry Is Not Making This Up"", and ""Dave Barry's Only Travel Guide You'll Ever Need""."
4,Fun to read a bit at a time,"I enjoyed this book partly because it is about 80 separate columns in one book. It's easy to skim the titles and choose one that sounds right for your mood. I read it before going to sleep over the course of a couple of months, one or two chapters most evenings. I didn't really read them in any set order and occasionally had to guess if I'd already read the chapter before looking at the first paragraph or two. Some of the stories are ""laugh out loud"" funny while others are just okay.It's certainly reasonably priced even if some of the material is a bit dated.I would recommend this book to any Dave Barry fan."
4,Darling outfit!,"I picked this romper up for two bucks, and its adorable. Carter's makes quality stuff! My baby is going to look too cute."
3,"Nice set, but needs more material","A very nice set that me back many years. My only complaint is why didn't they include the entire season. This is just ""Vol 1."""
5,None should be denied !,"For any and all Scooby Doo Fans the world over, If you missed this series either because you were living a life or you were not old enough or born yet and You Love Scooby Doo, You should watch this wonderful though short lived segment of the Scooby Doo phenomenon. If you are as crazy as I am, Owning every Scooby cartoon ever made and know the order of their introduction to the world, in order is BEST, but, this particular series is Absolutely wonderful on its own merits. Those who, and they must be a very rare few, have never seen a Scooby Doo cartoon who took the time to watch these few episodes would be addicted to the Scooby Doo craze!!! Well worth the hours and the $$$. Enjoy, D. Harris."
4,Is it Scooby-Doo Or Richie Rich?,"Okay, so if you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you won't like this, there are no mysteries and no masked monsters, only Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and their major problems. It's okay to watch, but it's not great, but the reason to get this is the 'Richie Rich show'. I enjoyed the 'Richie Rich show' more than the ""Scooby-Doo's Richie Riches Show"", but the Scooby-Doo part is still enjoyable. So here's the bottom line, if you are a fan of Scooby-Doo you will enjoy this (only because of Richie Rich)!"
3,Richie Rich and Scooby Doo DVD,"I purchased this two-disc DVD set for my eight-year-old daughter. She likes it, but she was diappointed that this ""rare"" show DOES NOT have Richie Rich and Scooby together on mystery-solving adventures. The descriptions on the box led us to believe that this was a show where Richie and Scooby actually teamed up. Sadly, it's not. It's just a series of short cartoons, alternating between Richie Rich and Scooby-Doo, each in their own separate cartoon story lines. Despite this disappointment, my daughter does enjoy these silly cartoons. Admittedly, they do not do much for me because I never got into Richie Rich and these Scooby adventures include (ugghh) Scappy-Dappy-Doo. For me, Scooby definitely jumped the shark by the time Scrappy showed up."
4,Where to start...,"Before I yak on, I'd like to say the episodes here were wonderfully remastered (much better than prints I've seen on the internet and television). Secondly, I really only bought this DVD for Scooby. Not that it's not nice having a bit of Richie for myself, but Scooby was my main priority.Now to the cons: First off, the episodes are out of order. REALLY, out of order. It was like they just threw random segments all over the place and just put that together. Also, there isn't a specific play episode selection (well, there is, but it's only for the separate shorts, not the full 40-something minute episode altogether). I was really hoping for an organized, COMPLETE SERIES set (I won't get into that because other reviews already have), and I ended up with this. And when and if they ever release a 'volume two', I hope more of an effort would be put that than here. Oh, well."
3,Buy it for the Bonus Features,"Regardless of your opinion of the Hanna-Barbera ""Richie Rich Show"", youreally should pick up ""The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show"" DVD just forthe bonus feature about Richie Rich. It features new interviews withJerry Beck, Mark Evanier, Scott Shaw!, and Sid Jacobson among others,and is worth the price of the DVD.Then you can have more fun by throwing tomatoes at your screen whenScrappy comes on."
2,EP is driving me Insane,"This is an EP with only four songs and a video as follows:1. Becoming Insane (radio mix) 3 mins2. Becoming Insane (album mix) 7:283. Deeply Disturbed (infected remix)4. Merlin (infected remix)5. Becoming Insane (video)It is good music to give the fans a taste of the new album soon to be released. I only gave it two stars because tracks 3 and 4 are old songs that were remixed, and the rest is the same song done in variations.Good music, but I am going to wait to buy the released album VICIOUS DELICIOUS. One may also buy the download files from the artist website."
5,"So far, the definitive account of Spielberg's life.","I've now read about five or six biographies of Steven Spielberg and all vary in depth and quality. However Joseph McBride book can only be described as THE most in-depth account of Spielberg's fascinating life. You simply won't read a more well-researched account of Spielberg's life unless the great man writes his autobiography. Don't be put off by the fact that Spielberg didn't co-operate with this book, virtually everyone else did including, most surprisingly, his father. A terrific read from start to finish."
4,A solid Spielberg book,"Steven Spielberg would approve of this highly interesting and informative book, which not only chronicles the movies, but also digs deeper to answer some very compelling questions, and unlike some Spielberg bios, McBride's tome answers all of them. Charting his illustrious career from his early work in TV, to films Like Duel, Jaws, Raiders, E.T, Jurassic Park and The Lost World, this is an eminently satisfying addition to my impressive Spielberg collection. If it has a flaw, there is too much focused on his output in the early 90s and not quite enough concerning his famously fantastic films in the 70s and 80s. Regardless, a cool book and a great weekend read. Highly recommended."
4,"Slow Start, but Great Read","This book is THICK. I was a little worried as it got off to a REALLY slow start and went way back into the past of Spielberg's grandparents - a little further back than I really cared for. As I was reading I was starting to get really disappointed as I had really been looking forward to reading about Spielberg and the book was not capturing my attention and I thought I would not continue to read it. But, I persisted and I'm glad I did as the book definitely picked up speed and kept my interested for the remainder. I finished the book and then found out Spielberg was coming to Gettysburg to speak at the 149th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address. I took the book with me and now have an autographed book. So glad I bought it!!! I do recommend."
5,Sonic Magic,This CD Sounds amazing!!! It was recorded mixed & mastered in all digital (DDD). The horns of Branford Marsalias literally come to life. Sting's lyrics & bass are tremaendous. I bought this in the early 90's new & when I listen to this with a pair of good headphones on it is amazing! Buy this...WOW!
4,Funky Brazilian jazz fusion,"This is a reissue of a 1970 album that many consider a jazz fusion benchmark. Brazilian pianist/arrangers Joao Donato and Eumir Deodato team up with an all-star cast, including fellow Brazilian expatriate Dom Um Romao and plenty of heavyweight North American jazz players to produce an energetic, somewhat aggressive set, built around Donato's electric piano work and a big, big beat. If you like ""Bitches Brew""-era Miles Davis, or those early Chick Corea albums, you might really dig this album."
2,Okay,"This software is okay, alot of the help files are only available in Profesional and Enterprise editions though. There is no C++ in 5 Days tutorial, but it says there is one on the box... The help files say it comes with InstallShield so you can create setup programs, but nope not this edition. To get other people to use your programs you have to send them certain .blp(?) files and some .dll's. The docs do not say which ones though, I am still trying to figure that out. It is good for learning, but if you can afford it, get the profesional edition, or get a different compiler."
1,I agree - BUGGY & BORDERLINE USELESS,"I have used versions 3, 4, & 5 over time. I just updated to 6 and what a mess. I can not get complex numbers to work at all. It is a simple thing to do - include <complex.h> and declare the variable complex<double> a. Just adding these two lines to a new application fails to compile under version 6.If you want support, it is $225 per case/question unless you pay for a support contract (didn't ask what that cost). Your other options include checking the FAQ database or posting to the newsgroup. If you post to the newsgroup, someone else (not from borland) must feel like replying with an answer - good luck on that happening."
2,Not for Beginners,"I bought this to update an old engineering program I'd written a decade ago. It came with minimal documentation, nothing that a beginner programmer can understand - not even on the CD. I checked their web site, which was not helpful, and after three attempts at installing the program (the installation program politely asked me if I wanted it to mangle Office 97 or Office 2000, neither of which I had on that computer), finally got it installed. I asked their customer support about the Office thing, and they send me a correct but not helpful email. I did manage to figure it out myself.Sure 'nuff, it was a pain to use.They did agree to take it back.I downloaded a free copy of Lcc-Win32, a free C compiler, that includes decent documentation and seems plenty powerful. It's at http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/."
1,Borland is now dead,"I've been a Borland C/C++ programmer since Turbo C 2.0 and for years it's been the best compiler. Not now. I purchased both Borland C++ Builder 6 and Microsoft Visual C++.NET - the Visual C++ box weighed approx 6 times that of Borland's box (and although weight don't make a compiler, it's an indicator of the vendor's features and support). Visual C++ gives you more bang for the buck but I don't like Microsoft's managed .NET direction. Looks like it's time to seek a Linux solution!"
1,BUGGY....borderline useless,"I have been a developer for a number of years. I have used visual c++, as well as borland's c++ builder. I have to say, that even though vc++ has its problems, none of them hold a candle to the kind of bugs bcb has. I cant count the number of times, borland has thrown an assertion, or an access violation just from selecting a break point! There are even bugs in the vcl code that prevent compiling! Here is a typical scenario:I boot up bcb. I open my project. I build it. I run it. It decides i havent built it yet so it rebuilds it, then shows me an error in some vcl file. ???? I rebuild it manually (after shutting down builder and restarting). No error, runs fine.Another scenario:Same as above, but borland randomly decides to throw an assertion while debugging, forcing a shut down of borland from the task manager (thus losing all my breakpoints, and if i havent saved, all my save info).All i can say is GRRRRRRRRR!"
1,I just bought this for $10 from Borland,"Excuse me. Check the Borland web site to confirm this product is available for $10. I just got my copy yesterday (Jan 26, 2004). If you view the product and back out of the web page, you get a pop up window which says ""Buy now and we will ship it for free"" which I did. Good luck"
3,Nice Debut,"As far as first albums go, this is a good one from Gentle Giant. As you might expect, it's a very different, less ""busy"" sound than the one they became better known for on later albums such as ""The Power and the Glory"" or ""Free Hand"".Songs like opener 'Giant' and track 6 'Why Not?' carry a ""rock""-ish sound to them, something that Gentle Giant really never touched on quite like this on future albums.The standout is definately 'Funny Ways', which most fans should recognise as on of the tracks on ""Playing the Fool"", the Gentle Giant live album. This track is similar to what would come on their next album, and is the first of the many Gentle Giant masterpieces that would come.Overall, probably not the best place to start with GG, as it's not exactly the best representation of their sound. I would start with ""Octopus"" or ""Free Hand"". But if you already have their later work, you could certainly do worse than pick this album up."
2,"A first effort. Well, they do get better.",Gentle Giant's first album shows a band with great potential. The problem here is their songwriting does not yet match their obvious musical ability. The compositions here show off some instrumental chops but don't go anywhere. This one is for completists only.
2,a little disappointed,"I was under the impression this was the ""Three Friends"" CD and it also came with a broken jewel case and ripped a bit. I would suggest better packaging in the future."
4,No synth riffs?,"Good remaster, still waiting for the rights to revert to the band so they can do a real remix/remaster.Where are all the synth riffs looped at the end of the album!? Repertoire cut the disc a little short."
1,A real disappointment,I waited anxiously for his next book. This one was boring. I could not finish it.
1,Carr Shifts Gears Unsuccessfully,"This hackneyed, poorly constructed futuristic novel is a major diappointment coming on the heels of Carr's previous successes, ""The Alienist"" and ""The Angel of Darkness"". Chapters of this book were serialized in magazines, and they read more like the cliffhangers of old Saturday matinee serials than they do an actual story. Chapter after chapter spills out in a directionless mess and one is left to wonder when the next moment of action will occur. When it does, it's a contrived letdown of sci-fi cliches. Carr may have constructed intricate settings and fully realized characters in earlier works, but that's nowhere to be found in ""Killing Time"". Here, he uses a high-concept approach but has nothing but empty ideas to back it up. A waste of everyone's ""time""."
1,Not good Cyber/Science Fiction....,"After reading parts of this novel in Time magazine a while ago I finally picked up this book in an airport. If it hadn't been that I had nothing else to do on a long flight there is no way I would have taken the time to wade thru this book. As an effort at Science Fiction or CyberPunk it really is bad, very bad. There are plenty of authors that do justice to this genre, Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling for example, Caleb Carr is not one of them."
2,Convoluted and far-fetched,"From time to time this book showed great potential, but the love affair between Gideon Wolfe and Malcolm's sister seemed like something out of a 1956 B movie. I didn't find Wolfe to have much depth and the rest of the characters were not explored enough. It was just okay and nothing more. I have come to expect much more from Carr."
2,Is the the same author as The Alienist and Angel of Darness?,"I bought this book because I really enjoyed The Alienist and the Angel of Darkness. Those books had memorable characters and complicated, deep plots. They were excellent mysteries that made it on to my ""top shelf"".This book, however, reminds me of schlocky sci-fi from the 40s and 50s. It reads almost like the plot to a cheesy action movie. It might have been enjoyable if I had not read Caleb Carr's other books and been expecting something different. If you are expecting the same, beware!"
2,"Well, the idea was interesting","Well, I'll start by saying that I do think that Caleb Carr is a very talented writer, HOWEVER, this book is an amateur effort, at best. Every chapter ends with heavy handed foreshadowing, and a cliff hanger which seems to be thrown in to keep you from putting the book down in disgust. The characters are very one-dimensional, especially the main character, and the book almost feels like a Luddite rant. Up until the end, technology is described as a purely destructive force, but then it is used to solve all the worlds ills in a Deus ex machina-like resolution, which to me felt like Star Trek's universal translator. To sum things up, while I do think that Caleb Carr writes very good historical thrillers, science fiction fables are not his forte. I would suggest picking up any James Morrow book instead of reading this."
2,Kind of interesting but poorly constructed,"This book is somewhat interesting in that it gives a historian a chance to turn his perspective forward and envision the future. And some of Carr's prophecies are thought-provoking (though not necessarily original) and cause for a ""hmmmmmm..."", particularly knowing they were constructed pre-9/11.However, the characters are one-dimensional and hastily developed, the ""technology-may-be-harmful"" message is delivered so forcefully that it becomes obnoxious despite its air of truth, and ultimately the plot transitions are so poor that the story can't stand as much more than an infantile adventure."
1,Are you sure Caleb Carr wrote this?!,"Ever since I read The Alienist, I have touted the brilliance of Mr. Carr. Angel of Darkness was a lesser effort, but I continued to praise the author's writing to anyone who would listen. I have been waiting anxiously for his next novel. I don't read his books, I savor each word, marveling at his abilities. As I began doing with this book. I was so thoroughly bored, however, that I gave up half way through. So, I have to ask, did someone mistakening put his name on the cover? The characters are cartoonish, the action boring, and the ending, well, I'll never know. I think I will reread The Alienist instead."
1,very disappointing,"I had loved The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness - but I couldn't even bear to finish reading this one! The characters are cartoonish, the short chapters jarring. It seemed like the author had a good idea, but didn't develop it with the depth and richness of his previous novels."
1,Not what I expected from Carr,"I bought this last night at the airport because I was looking for a good read on my trip home. Picked the Carr book becuase I liked the Alienist. What a bad choice. Read the first two chapters and then left it on the plane. Save your money and more importantly, time. Pass on this one."
1,What a shame,"Maybe it is because this book is set in a different genre than Caleb Carr's first two novels. Maybe it is because it was written in serialized form for Time Magazine. More likely it is a combination of the two. The end result, however, is an almost unreadable book with nothing important or clever to say. It is a painfully slow read and the characters were not likeable."
1,Appropriate title,"""Killing Time"" is exactly what you are doing reading this piece of garbage. The sad part is, you'll never get back the hours of your life that were totally wasted in the endeaver. Did he write this in high school?Immensely enjoyed ""The Alienist"" and ""Angel of Darkness"". Wonder why they haven't been made into movies?"
2,"Oh, Please","Oh please, Mr. Carr- bring back your charcters from The Alienest and and The Angel of Darkness. This book was a quick read, but not much fun. Your other stories were much more exciting and. This new book leaves me unsatisfied."
2,What a Stinker,"This book reminds me of ""Tom Swift Jr. and His Secret Atomic Airplane"". I really enjoyed that book but I was also 9 years old at the time. Caleb Carr has written much better in genres that he knows. SciFi isn't one of them."
1,What a Disappointment,"This is the most disappointing book I have read in a long time. As with the other reviewers, I became a Caleb Carr fan through his previous two books, and I bought this one as soon as I saw it. I can only think he decided to make a quick buck off of his name or he simply wanted a vehicle for his book long diatribe against modern society and its technological trappings. The plot is contrived and illogical, and the characters are shallow to the point of cartoonish. Even the science, what there is of it in the book, is bad. The hand held ""rail gun"" that purportedly delivered enough energy to disintegrate a human body into small pieces would have enough recoil to kill the user. In the chase of the fanatic terrorist the group had ample opportunities to eliminate him but the author contrived illogical reasons why they could not do so in order to keep the chase going. I just wish the rating system allowed for zero stars. This book earned it."
3,Barely 3 stars,"Carr's pessimistic view of the future and the preachy fashion in which it's presented made this book hard to finish, although with effort, I made it through. Carr's previous novels far surpassed this piece of work. The ideas and the plot definitely had potential, but Carr just couldn't quite fulfill it. This book seemed to be written more for Carr's ideas of the future, and not for thrills and suspense.Recommend...The library"
2,Pedantic and Plodding,"I couldn't put ""The Alienist"" down; I liked ""Angel of Darkness,"" though it moved slower--we knew who the killer was all along. But this?""Killing Time"" is aptly titled. I felt I was killing time every attempt I made to read it. Half way through, I returned it to the library. Although I appreciated, even endorsed, Carr's concept of knowledge versus facts, I felt I was swallowing a pedantic sermonette from a bloated short story. The writing rarely moved me with the evocative narrative of his first books; in fact, I found certain details--or lack thereof--distracting.Carr is a gifted writer, particularly when he allows his characters to drive the story. In his previous books, I walked away with strong ideas that he had communicated through a genuine story. Here, his characters are props for a concept. An interesting concept, yes. The framework for cardboard characters, no."
1,Worst Book I Ever Finished!,"From the unexplained suspension in the protagonist's common sense to the world-renowned scientists performance of feats of strength and agility to the predictable bedding of the ""beautiful sister of the mastermind"" by the hero (or visa versa), this book is full of things that make you say - ""this book is missing some pages.""For some reason, I kept reading...maybe it's the vague resemblance of the insane yet brilliant brother-sister combo to the villains of the old TV show Wiseguy."
1,Not Worth the Wait,"A few months ago I was excited to read that Caleb Carr was coming out with a new book. I loved both the Alienist and Angel of Darkness and couldn't wait to read his newest.It was such a disappointment. While the concept was interesting, the characters and plotlines were unable to hold my attention. I am hopeful that Carr will read some of these reviews and start a new book of the genre that gave him a legion of fans. If you loved the Alienist and Angel of Darkness don't get this book expecting it to be the same because you will probably be disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"This was a book that I really wanted to like, which made it all the more upsetting when I didn't. Caleb Carr is an extremely talented writer, and he makes great use of every word. His prose is compact, but not overly brief.That said, great writing can't salvage a poorly plotted story. ""Killing Time"", although set in a believable future, requires the reader to make constant leaps of faith about technology and the ability of private citizens to obtain it. Also, Carr finds no redeeming value in any of the wonderful inventions he creates, which, aside from being depressing, is completely unrealistic. This view of technology, which has no broad basis in historical fact, tends to drag the book down.Furthermore, the plot is rushed in many places, while dragging in others. One is never drawn into the flow of this book, which is a shame considering the strong writing and premise this book has as it's foundation."
1,"This book Sucks, both time & money",Very Disapointing! Loved the previous material by Caleb. Don't waist your money or time.
1,Could dung beetles find redemption in this?,"I loved his first two books and had hope for this one; the premise was intriguing.But this book is really more Dan Brown than Dan Brown, melded with an incomprehensible plot seemingly ripped from 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea melded with a collapsing modern society.I particularly enjoyed how a man is able to buy plutonium from a jungle warlord and somehow cast and machine that -- in the air -- while trying to evade several air forces.But the best incongruity comes when a civilian parachutes out, gets a broken leg, and ultimately blasts away veteran guerrillas surrounding him with a stun gun. Two pages later, because it fit the author's needs, we find out that he actually shot them not with the stun gun but fatally, and with his portable rail gun, which is made from no metallic parts, but another set of guerrillas who were watching him didn't realize what happened."
1,Killing Time - apt title,"Killing Time - that's precisely what I did - or what the author did to MY time - when I read this book.""The world wants to be deceived"" - a theme of this book - was proven true when I purchased this book - believing the book to have been written by a great author named Caleb Carr.'nuff said."
1,"Dan Brown meets 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea","When a writer needs this many adjectives--characters don't walk from one spot to another, they ""stride purposefully""--we know we need to abandon ship. Even this cool air-to-underwater ship. Save yourself! Bail now."
3,Generous 3,"This book had potential but was not well-developed. I think it would have been better as a short story. One thing that bothered me was that Gideon just decides to drastically change his life and join a fringe group without any contemplation. I kept waiting for the questions any sane person would ask these people. They didn't come until the end.That being said, the message of not believing everything you read in the news is extremely important. It's too bad the book wasn't better written so it could reach more people."
4,Impressive,"I agree with the review that compares the style of this thought provoking novel with Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. In light of 9/11, the proliferation of misinformation on the internet, and the entertainment/news via 24/7 cable, Carr is right on target."
1,Killing time - if you have plenty of time to waste,"Jesus, I can;t believe I have read thru the whole book. The story is flat and the characters are not interesting at all. And it has the most terrible ending ever written in a novel."
1,"This Book Could Have Been Great, BUT...","In the afterword, Carr thanks his agent for getting him this assignment. You got to be kidding, man. Who in their right mind would 'assign' somebody a novel? I blame the publishers for fumbling the ball on this one. The idea was great, but the follow-through was horrific.The publishers, if they had any guts, should have fired the writer and hired someone with real talent and imagination and story-telling ability. I would rather read John Grisham's interpretation of this idea. I would at least be entertained...."
1,A Screenplay waiting for a Movie,"Caleb Carr's new book, Killing Time, was a real disappointment. The plot was sketchy, the characterization was cartoonish, and the action resembles a badly contrived action movie screenplay. I have read comic books with more depth and development. This book feels like a first attempt at a novel by an new author. In comparison to Carr's other books this is a dismal read; in comparison to other futuristic, cyberpunk books, this is a travesty. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,And now for something completely different,"As a great fan of the first Carr books -- the historical mysteries set in Old New York City -- I looked forward eagerly to his third. It is clear that Carr wants to get out of his historical niche and try his hand at something new; he has set his new book in 2024. His determination to break with the past may be what Carr wants, but it is a great disappointment to this reader. The novel is filled with the coy prognostications of doom and hindsight that seem more smug than inventive and are so familiar in trite examples of that genre. True, he has attempted to create a strange book universe as he did with the New York City of 100 years ago. But it comes off as more a draft for a sci-fi movie than a satisfying read. In fairness to potential readers, I only made it to page 100. It may have gotten better thereafter. Somehow I doubt that."
5,Once again an amazing turn-out from an excellent author,"It is rare for a book to grab at you with the ferocity that this book does. By the time you get to page 20, you are sucked in through the very end. This book will having you turn the pages as fast as your eyes can read, as you wander in and out of belief and disbelief of everything that you think of history and the information that the public accepts as fact every day.A departure from the old-timed style of ""The Alienist"" and ""Angel of Darkness,"" the characters become real and the stories completely believable as you read. Caleb Carr proves once again that he can spin a tale with the best of them."
1,Surprisingly Awful,"I enjoyed The Alienist and Carr's derivative follow-up The Angel of Darkness. However, Killing Time is a slog. A ludicrous plot, stilted prose and ""deep"" ideas about propaganda and culture that are laughably naive. Disappointing."
1,Embarrasingly bad,"This is a comic book without the pictures. I cannot imagine it being of interest to anyone other than ten (okay, eight) year old boys. It has the characters and plotline of a shuffled deck of Pokemon(r) cards and clunky prose to boot. It is a serious, fatal mistake to make your narrator a pompous professorial type and then keep illustrating his pomposity ad nauseam. I literally could not finish it and really would like my money back. Carr's previous books were of an uneven quality but this is a surprisingly bad development. Read the instruction manual for your VCR before you start this one; it has better science, clearer prose, more interesting characters and a better plot."
1,Not much here,"Knowing Caleb Carr only by his reputation for his previous two novels, I thought this might be an interesting introduction to his work for an old sci-fi buff like myself. I was wrong. The book is enticing enough with promise to keep one paging forward but it really never delivers. Nothing in it is new though it struggles to remain game and enticing with a real plethora of fake foreshadowing and come ons. I am only 3/4 of the way through and, though I intend to gut it on out, I will be extremely surprised if the end is any different from what I have already guessed it will be. If anything, this demeans the genre and I would respectfully ask Caleb to return to what he does best and leave the hallowed halls of Heinlein, Asimov, Pohl, Cherryh and the immortal Phillip K Dick undisturbed in the future."
2,killing time alright!,"I'm sure there are many like myself who patiently endures the two or three years between Carr novels.I immensely enjoyed 'The Alienist'and the follow up, 'The Angel of Darkness'.I finished 'Killing Time' in all of two days, not because the story was particularly riveting,but because it is only 274 pages. I couldn't help but think as I read the story that perhaps this would have made a better short story in an anthology collection.While I thought the 'Twilight Zone' premise of the story was kind of intriguing, I am kind of disappointed.I'm not saying not to read it, it is not entirely bad, but it is not what Ive come to expect from Caleb Carr."
1,Wasting Time,"Except for some pre-9-11 references to Afganistan, this book would lose continuity and plausibility and the readers' interest faster than it does now. Save your time."
2,A big disappointment,"Like other recent reviewers, I'd read Carr's other books and enjoyed them, but this one was simply too off-the-wall and unbelievable to be enjoyable. The only saving grace was that it was a short, easy read.The ""elevator talk"" for this book, on the other hand, is a very interesting plot -- it's the execution that was the problem."
1,Must agree with the majority....it stunk,"I'm sure most people will have figured out the average reader response by the time that they get to my review, but I couldn't resist adding my two cents. This book was just plain bad. It was a Jules Verne/H.G. Wells wanna-be and it was a gigantic disappointment after The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness. The characters were one dimensional and the dialogue was forced and silly. It felt like it wanted to be a Michael Crichton style techie-book but Carr just didn't seem to have the talent to get to the meat of the story. I plowed my way through it because I liked his other books and I suffer from that guilty feeling when I don't give an author a chance...but I should've quit reading when I started to realize it was lame...after two chapters. Go check out the latest Jeff Deaver reprints if you want a good story...avoid this at all costs."
1,Disappointment,"Celeb Carr is known for his historical fiction thrillers (which I loved). Here he tries to tackle the future.. hence science fiction. My advice is he lay off the latter. The novel is very weak science fiction, the premise weak, and the story is put together in a way remenicent of light weight serial novella of old while trying to make a serious point which instead sounds silly. The results are that the novel is not fun to read. Save your money and buy his earlier work instead."
3,Best enjoyed with a bag of popcorn.,"Carr has a gift for portraying the reluctant participant in an ensemble of brilliant but quirky characters. You know, the guy who's always asking himself, ""What the heck am I doing here?""Don't pick up _Killing Time_ expecting a magnum opus. In terms of both detail and perspective, Carr lightens up the atmosphere quite a bit from previous novels--maybe too much, given the some of the book's events.It's an entertaining read, but beware, hard sci-fi afficionados. You won't find detailed theories on or explanations of railguns, superconductors, or holographic projection, all of which Carr uses effectively to support the story and spice things up along the way."
1,"If you liked the Alienist, you will hate this book...","I was eager to read this book. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next Carr book since I so enjoyed his last two. I saw it in the store and bought it with barely a glance at the cover. From the get go, I was bored. It had a very predictable and shallow progression. And if I read the words ""like so much"" again in that book, I was going to scream! (You know what I mean if you read this book!). To me, Caleb was trying too hard to illustrate that this book took place in the future. Too many cheesy references to events of the last twenty years. A person writing in a diary would be writing to his fellow citizens, not people in the year 2000. To end on a good note, read the Alienist and the Angel of Darkness! These were great books!"
1,Is Carr Trying To Get Out of His Contract?,"As a big fan of The Alienist and Angel of Darkness, I forkedout [the money] the second I saw this book. I'd love to run into Mr. Carr in person and ask him face to face for my money back. I have never seen a such an extreme plummet in quality from a favorite author. Did the same man write this book? It is so flat and so tacky and 2 dimensional I couldn't make it past the first 75 pages. I'll be visiting the library to check out Mr. Carr's next book. If you're still not convinced, I'll sell you my copy for a dollar."
3,"Good, up to a point","I've enjoyed reading this author's previous novels, and so I looked forward to reading this new one. Initially I was not disappointed, for there is action from the beginning, and an interesting plot. Unfortunately, as things go on there is so much philosophical-type discussion among the characters that it tends to dominate the pages, and I slowly began to lose interest, even when exciting things began to happen. Perhaps it's just me, but there seemed to be an extremely huge hole in the plot that made the ending of the book completely implausible. The world created and described by the author appears to be a good extrapolation of today's conditions, but that's not enough to rescue this work."
4,A courageous prophecy,"I am delighted to see that the articulate neurosurgeon of the human psyche has taken his scapel to our quite possible future. Perhaps the sappy ending was necessary to keep us all from reaching for too much prozac, but his dystopic vision is dead eye. We reject his insight as ""just politics"" at our own peril. Just who do we think we are? As Carr notes so well, ""We want to be deceived."" Carr refuses to deceive us and some are petulant - unless we recognize prophecy when we see it - not as prediction but as warning - then we are just willing to be led off the cliff into the postmodern chaos of industrial feudalism."
1,Not worth it,This book was seriously disappointing. It's hard to believe that this is the author of 'The Alienist'.
1,He swings and misses,"To keep it short- Caleb Carr needs to stick to historical fiction. This novel was well below the standard he created from both ""The Alienist"" and ""The Angel of Darkness""."
2,There are far better ways to kill time,I read this book because I enjoyed The Alienist and its sequel. Besides belonging to a different genre than his earlier work it is also much less of a page turner. The title of this book aptly describes my experience of reading it.
1,"read ""The Alienist"" but pass on this","""The Alienist"" is a fabulous book and I reccommend it to everyone. This one, however, isn't so great. Keep writing Mr. Carr, I can't wait till your next book."
1,Wasting Time,Sadly enough reading Carr's new novel 'Killing Time' is 'Wasting Time'. I was very disappointed because I had very high expectations after reading The Alienist and Angel...
1,And another point....,"I couldn't agree more with the vast majority who negatively reviewed this book. But while the majority correctly point out the literary failures and the anti-internet sentiments, none seem to recognize Mr. Carr's ""Green"" (ie. environmental) and anti-world trade positions. In fact, he appears to support the histrionic viewpoints of the hate-America crowd lead by Professor Chomsky. He doesn't take long to tell us of the polution of the oceans, the evil of the America-Chinese economic ties. A key tale deals with the sacrifice of American servicemen in a ""war"" to gain Chinese hegemony over Taiwan.When one considers all of the failings of this book, we must wonder if Mr. Carr intended to write a political fable for our times."
3,Interesting but plodding,"Over all, a decent read but the story plodded along and Carr doesn't fully develop the dismay protagonist must have felt in his situation as much as I think he could have. Additionally, this novel felt short. What I mean by that is that more of the storyline could have been developed. It felt more like a short story. It is probably important to remember this was originally serialized in Time magazine in 2000.I am hoping this is not indicative of Carr's future work because I really loved the ""Alienist"" and ""The angel of darkness."""
1,Killing Time...Waste of Time,"""Killing Time"" lacks all of the things that one has come to expect of Caleb Carr...a good story with incredible attention to detail, characterization and motivation. What a disappointment! Where was the background information of the main character? If he was a profiler, why wasn't his skill employed by the group? Was he included in the program simply because he was attractive to the genetically altered and physically perfect female on the team? The list of questions could go on, but that would indicate that the reader actually cared. Let me just say that instead of provoking the reader to ask questions about the future of our species, it merely prompts the question: Was Caleb's VISA bill due?"
3,Ambitious but messy sci fi novel.,"I agree with most of the other readers' comments. The idea about how the Internet could be overtaken by one group and then used to throw the world in chaos by illusionary ""discoveries""( that are forged) is unique and interesting. Unfortunately, the characters and their motivations are not! We never get to care for the people in the book because they are all bad in some way. The only interesting plot line was the one in Africa...and that's 25 pages til the end. Even chasing Dov was boring and the result predicatable and not enlightening. Totally dissappointed by this author who's last 2 books were brilliant. I wonder if this being a serialized novel in the magazine TIME first was part of the problem?? Just a mess, really. Buy THE WALKING by Bentley Little instead."
1,Quite a Disappointment,"Having recently discovered Caleb Carr, I was very excited to see a new book by him set in the future. Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment. The premise of the book is timely and interesting (information is not knowledge) but Mr. Carr chooses to present his story with fantastic and unbelieveable scenarios and shallow characters. This book reminded me a lot of James Patterson's When the Wind Blows, another dismal effort by a good author. If you must read Killing Time, check it out of your local public library. Don't waste your money."
1,"This is a joke, right?","I am convinced Caleb Carr did not write this book. My best guess is that he paid a mediocre high school student a small sum while he continued to rest on his past laurels. The result? No character development, the romance is cliche, and the climax is predictable.This novel should be a 40 page essay on the dangers of information technology."
4,WOW! HARSH CRITICS,"Wow a lot of harsh critics out there. No it is not like The Alienist or Angel of Darkness, but why should it have to be? It has been years from first reading this book, but I remember enjoying it very much. I think it shows another side and writing style of Carr. If you have an open mind I think it can be an interesting read. I suppose if you don't like sci-fi at all then stay away."
1,Don't even kill time with this book!,"Having read other books by Caleb Carr, I expected a lot of this book, which I bought sight unseen. BIG MISTAKE. I am a science fiction fan as well as a mystery fan, and Killing Time is a waste of time in either genre. The characters are so shallow that even cartoons do better. Carr's idea of character differentiation is to make one character call everything (machines, food, ideas) 'sexy' while another is constantly putting the make on every male she meets. The plot is somewhat weaker than the characters. Save yourself some time and money and give this book a pass!"
1,interesting dystopia but a lame deus ex-machina ending,"I wasn't disappointed because this novel wasn't another ""The Alienist""-- after all, a writer can change styles! I was disappointed because the technique of the novel is bad, despite the interesting near-future setting. This novel had no character development, and little of what I liked about Carr's previous work (a believable and reasonably detailed analysis of the psychological foundations for the behavior of the characters). Instead of this story, I found myself wishing I was reading the physological history of the USA referred to in the novel instead! The worst flaw, though, was the ending. Carr didn't seem to know where to go with the escalating hoaxes, and instead opted for a weak and completely ridiculous ending."
4,Interesting extrapolation,"Although different from Carr's earlier work, Killing Time is an interesting extrapolation of current environmental and political trends into the near future, by a knowldgeable historian. I especially liked the narrator's attempt to look at all sorts of topical issues without illusions or political correctness."
2,Wish I'd got it from the library.,"I was so anticipating this book since I LOVED his previous work. I kept looking-up ""Caleb Carr"" on this site and last summer I pre-ordered this book and waited longingly to receive it. I am, as many others are, disappointed. I couldn't get into the characters and the ""techie"" future. It may be a good book in and of itself--but as a Carr fan it just seemed wrong. Sci-fi fans will probably enjoy it. I can only hope that we will see more of him in the style we've loved for years. It is definately not a book I would have bought if Carr's name wasn't on it. PS--Did anyone else notice Carr sitting at the bar in the movie 200 Cigarettes?"
3,Forget his previous novels and keep an open mind,"What the heck? Everyone attacked ""Killing Time"" because it didn't read like Caleb Carr's previous historical fiction works. And while I admit it wasn't as intriguing as ""The Alienist"" or ""The Angel of Darkness,"" (and fortunately, also not as long), I thought it WAS perfectly acceptable science fiction, albeit clipped, serialized sci-fi.If you read the note at the end of the book first, you'll see that Carr was asked to write a serial story of life in the near future. I thought he did an admirable job with his ""internet information controls convential wisdom"" plotline. And the ending was surprisingly upbeat considering the apocolyptic tones of the rest of the book.I would've given the book 3 1/2 stars if able because, while ""Killing Time"" wasn't as good as Carr's first two books, it was perfectly acceptable as science fiction. So keep THIS day job, Mr. Carr!"
1,What happened to Caleb Carr?,"Killing Time, by Caleb Carr is mind-numbingly bad. (Doc Savage rides again?) Zero stars would be more appropriate."
2,"I tried, I really tried....","A group of people are thrown together under extraordinary circumstances to accomplish a common goal. OK, familiar so far. This reader felt lost after that point. This group is sick of big business and government controlling information and the media - conspiring to manipulate the thoughts and actions of the populace by any means necessary. In retaliation; the good guys start to control information, the media, and pull stunts to manipulate the thoughts and actions of the populace. Can't we all just please get along? Heavy on Trekkian political rhetoric, this novel never really went anywhere. I really enjoyed the ""Alienist"" and hope that Dr. Kreizler has some shoe leather left."
1,How could this be?,"While reading this insipid, uneventful, and (thank goodness for somethings), brief exercise in comic book-like drivel, I kept checking the jacket of the book cover to truly discover who might have authored this waste-of-time book. Certainly it couldn't have been the Caleb Carr who so deftly brought 19th Century New York and the dark themes it embraced to life in his previous two novels. I'm still shocked at the insignificance of his words in this one. Caleb, how could you?"
2,"Carr is a GREAT writer, but this book doesn't measure up","I agree with the assessment of many others in this review space -- this book is unrelentingly ""O.K."" I write primarily to those of you who've not read Carr's other books. It's a mistake to give up on him. The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness are everything that Killing Time is not. Don't make the mistake of thinking that this book is representative of his work. You WILL miss out."
1,Disappointment,"Having read two of Mr Carrs' previous books and enjoyed them tremendously, I am so disappointed in this new novel. The plot was so thin as to be non-existent and the characters were two dimensional at best. I listened to the book on audio and found myself having to constantly rewind because my attention had wandered and I had missed part of the story. I wish I had missed the whole story. Please tell Mr Carr that he does not have the voice to tell his stories. His voice is monotonous. The real problem was the story and I will be reluctant to buy another Caleb Carr novel in the future."
3,Not The Alienist or Angel of Darkness....not terrible though,"I pre-ordered this book on Amazon before any information was available. His two previous works about the NYC gang hooked me. This book is nothing like those titles.Once I stepped back and took an objective look, I discovered that this effort is really not that bad. I was expecting more in character development and the plot was not as interesting as I had expected, but not every book you read has to be seemless. Let your imagination go and consider the topic he sets forth.I recomend Killing Time as a great book to read as a quick excursion. At only 274 pages, there is no reason to worry about ""wasting time."" Give it a try."
1,Poor read from a distinguished writer. Who really wrote this book?,"Having enjoyed The Alienist and Angel of Darkness, I looked forward to this Caleb Carr novel. I cannot believe that he wrote it. Based on other books, I expected well developed characters, well researched basis for the plot elements, and even some message. I was disappointed to find very flat characters poorly described and with little explanation for their motivations, a proposterous plot largely drawn from Jules Verne, and a preachy, unconvincing message. I dragged myself all the way through hoping to find SOMETHING worth the effort. I should have checked the Amazon reader reviews before buying this book. Killing Time is what I did and I want that time back along with the purchase price. I can't believe this is a Caleb Carr book. It contains nothing like his other works in tone or quality. What a disappointment."
1,Non-Fiction Disguised as Fiction,"Call it intellectual, philosophical, prophetic, whatever. I call it boring and opaque. I felt like I was reading someone's undergraduate assignment.I chose to read this book because I heard Carr was a great writer. I assume this is true for his other books, but this book is just beyond boring. It is less of a story and more of a string of worst case scenarios for Carr's predictions for the future.Sure, it may be a commentary on today's problems and what will go wrong if we do not straighten up, but I really did not care as I was reading it. He just did not connect with me as a reader. Frankly, I'd rather read a non-fiction social commentary than an essay pretending to be fiction.Skip it. Read his other books."
4,"Intelligent & philosophical/not a ""thriller""","In answer to those who think the writing is too overdone (like Henry James) I say that actually it's not; it's just intelligent. If you are going to converse on important issues you're going to have to use a few three-syllable words. I actually experienced this book through the unabridged audiobook version, and I had no trouble with the language. It sounded like natural speech between intelligent people. I would say that even though there is adventure in this book, it's not trying to ride on it's thrill-level. The best part of this book is cerebral and issues about the shape of the ship are really inane. If a ship's shape matters to you, you might be a little bored with this book. (...) I'm not saying there is no adventure, but you'll have to keep skipping over large parts of the book to get to it and the action will seem rather pointless."
1,This can't be,"How disappointing! I've been watching for another book by Carr, but not one like this. It's hard to believe he's the same author who wrote Alienist and Angel. I read half the book (only because I was stuck in an airport) and found both the characters and writing style to be extremely superficial. No way I could get interested. (I hardly put either of his first two books down.) Decided to skip to the end for the surprise--which was as disappointing as the rest of the book. Please tell me this wasn't really Caleb Carr's doing!!"
1,Disappointing...,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Carr, since this book is such a departure from his historical fiction (""The Alienist,"" and ""The Angel of Darkness""--""The Alienist"" is a masterpiece!). I was disappointed in this book. I don't know what Carr was trying to achieve with this novel, but it's a combination of mystery and science fiction that doesn't quite come off, in my humble opinion.It takes place in 2023, and it's mainly about the assassination of the President in 2018. The investigation into it takes the main character, psychiatrist Dr. Gideon Wolfe, through many confusing twists and turns, and I was left confused and wondering what Carr was trying to prove here. It was not easy reading, and it seemed as if the book had been written in haste--there was not the character development nor the detailing one expects from Carr's fiction."
2,"Stick to historical fiction, Caleb","Being a big fan of 'The Alienist' and 'Angel of Darkness' as well as of sci-fi, I was naturally really looking forward to 'Killing Time."" Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. All of the great character development from 'The Alienist' and 'Angel of Darkness' was missing but what was worse was that Carr doesn't have the gift for describing the future in a way that isn't laborious. You can pass on this book and hope for another historical thriller from Carr sometime soon."
1,God awful,"A few pages into this book I stopped and thought ""what ...is this!?!""This book seems to be a collection of cardboard characters that have been combined with Mr. Carr's laundry list of complaints about current society and government. I've read Red Chinese propaganda from the Cultural Revolution that was subtler!Gee, so ya think the Internet leads to a dissemination of bad science and half truths? Why don&#65533;t you pound it in our heads over and over again throughout the book? No, 25 times isn&#65533;t enough! Please repeat it like a mantra!Yeesh.That and it also reads bad makeover of a Doc Savage novel with a dash of clumsy sexuality added.I really don't understand what happened after the two ""Alienist"" books but this was 99% worse than either of those.I so wanted to like this novel, but it took all my effort to finish it off.All I can say is ""WOW&#65533;... much as I would when seeing a car wreck.Mr Carr, better luck next time."
1,Even One Star is Too Many,"This was awful. With all due respect to the reviewer who beleives this was meant in homage to writers like Verne, this was simply a homage to garbage. If you pick this up after having read his previous novels, you will be sorely disappointed. If you don't beleive the large majority of reviewers, and must read it please go to the library and get it. Save your money to buy another copy of the Alienist."
2,What happened?,"I've read The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness, also by Mr. Carr, and Killing Time was a huge let down. Although some of the initial ideas were good, the plot was thin and could not hold my interest. The characters were not given as much depth, as in his first two novels, therefore, as a reader I could have cared less of what happened to them. All in all, this was a huge disappointment. Mr. Carr was presumably an outstanding author, which was evident with his first two novels, however, Killing Time contradicts that presumption."
1,This Book Was So Bad.......,"I didn't have the fortitude to finish it. I didn't care what happened in Mr. Carr's pulp science fiction novel. Flash Gordon was better. I loved the Alienist, didn't like Angel of Death....and didn't have the strength for Killing Time. I started the book looking forward to Mr. Carr's insightful, beautifully described look into the future. Unfortunately, he offers up one or two twists on what the world will be like in 23 years, kind of like seeing the Statue of Liberty buried in the sand in the ""Planet of the Ape's"" movie. Only there wasn't enough intelligence in the writing to make me want to keep going. Boring, boring, badly written and a big disappointment."
3,Jules Verne for the new century?,"Caleb Carr is best known for mysteries set in nineteenth-century New York. This book is set in the twenty-first century but reads like nineteenth-century SF i.e. Verne or Wells. The parallels to Captain Nemo and the Nautilus are especially strong. So fans of Gibsonesque cyberpunk won't like it. The technology is sketchily described and blaming the Internet for the virtual collapse of civilization is a little simplistic. There are also logical lapses. For example in one chapter Carr descibes how dead the ocean is, fish having been wiped out by pollution and overfishing. In the next he descibes the teeming seabirds on the Scottish island of St. Kilda. So what exactly are the birds feeding on? On the other hand the story really moves and the characters are well drawn and likable. All in all the book might be worth buying used or checking out at the library. But I don't think I'd pay full price for it."
2,"""Wasting Time"" would have been a more appropriate title...","As an avid Caleb Carr fan, I was thrilled to discover that he had moved into a new genre of literature with this book. What astounds me is how someone who was so masterful at creating imagery in his last two novels has done such a poor job of creating it in this book. The characters lack substance, the futuristic plot is simplistic and ineffective, and Carr's writing lacks the polish of his earlier work. I finished this book not because of its quality, but because of my respect for the author. By reading this, you will truly be ""killing time""."
2,waste of time,"I NEVER quit reading a book once I begin...but this one just didn't deserve any more of MY time after I read about 2/3 of it... I just wondered why I was reading this??? Poor character development, convoluted story line--in short, nothing to keep me as a reader. This author was evidently on his soap box about the evils of the internet and the unreliability of the news organizations. It was just asking too much to spend any more time with this lame story...I was suprised too, because I thought The Alienist was a good read."
4,Worth the read!,"I just finished this book last night, and was suprised to find the severe criticism of Killing Time here. The plot is fun and interesting, and the commentary is fascinating and worth pondering. So many reviewers have focused on his ""information is not knowledge"" line, but that is something many critical thinkers have been saying for years. The best part of this book was the contrast of a highly technological ""civilized"" culture with an African tribe the main character also spends time with. The story evolves so that we realize that the answer is not quite so simple as the rejection of information, for that often leads to an even worse consequence. Rather, the main character realizes that any attempt to cure the ills of a (dis-)information society must address people's love of information and their equal dislike of any serious contemplation of information.Once again, definitely worth the read."
1,big mistake,"After reading and enjoying Mr Carr's 1st two books, I happily grabbed this book up and was ready for an entertaining evening. Sadly, this may be the worst book I have read in the last ten years. Immature, pointless, self-serving, and just plain bad. Mr. Carr shows much promise as a novelist and it is a shame he stank so bad here. Whoever Mr. Carr is trying to emulate with this dreck should try to shake some sense back into him."
1,Where do I go to get my money back?,"Seldom have I been as disappointed in a book as this one by Caleb Carr. Having read and thorougly enjoyed his first two novels -- The Alienist & The Angel of Darkness -- I was excited to find this newest work and very anxious to read it. Maybe somebody else is writing under his name, because this one shows none of the writing abilities such as the sense of narrative, the attention to detail, the descriptive mastery of his first two. It is almost like this is an outline, sketchy at best, for a tale of great scope. His description of the holocaust created within is so minute, that it removes all sense of purpose for the characters' actions. And he can do so much better. This is just a bad, bad book. Only his name could have sold this one to a publisher. He owes us all an apology and he owes me..."
1,Too bad.....,"Quite a negative surprise. I was becoming a Caleb fan, and waited a long time (for me) for this new book, and now we get this Hi-tech, Sci-Fi junk. He should stick with what he knows. If I wanted to read this type of book, I would seek better Authors in this field. Pity, we might be witnessing the death of a good Author, who got bored with his previous style. Shame."
3,Tom Swift meets John Galt,"A quick, fun read whose message seems to be: Don't believe all that you read or hear (especially off the Interenet!)."
1,Jules Verne,"This is a puerile attempt at science fiction that is written at the 12 - 18 year level. It lacks credible science in the same way that Jules Vernes 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea described Captain Nemo and the vessel. Its abstraction of the dangers of the internet into a horrible future are valid, but supported with magic not credible logic."
5,Caleb Carr is the master!,"Great story! Great book! Do yourself a favor--get this book! And while you're at it, pick up The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness as well. You won't be disappointed. Mr. Carr, my hat is off to you! I wait impatiently for your next bestseller."
1,Elmer Fudd Reads a Killing Time...,"I haven't finished this book and I'm not sure I will. I'm shocked that Caleb Carr's editors, producers, handlers and the like would allow him to read his own book on audiotape with the lisp he has! I'm so distracted every time he says a word with the letter ""s"" in it - he sounds just like Elmer Fudd! It really detracts from the overall book-on-tape experience. What a bummer! An author's ego should come second to a listener's enjoyment."
4,Surprising,"Having read both The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness, I hate to admit that I actually found myself looking forward to this latest novel from Caleb Carr. I was not disappointed by this latest effort. I had hoped that it was to be another in his previous series, but found myself drawn into this world of his creation. One of the most surprising elements of this novel, once I realized the characters were different, was the parallels between the character ensembles and their activities. Faced with extreme situations, the group found time for intellectual discussions over dinner, something lacking in the modern world. I hated for the book to end and was surprised at the outcome, the solution was almost too easy. Here's hoping for another book by Mr Carr, featuring either group of characters."
1,Rabbit food anyone?,"I had read ""The Alienist"" and thought it was O.K. enough to try another of Carr's books.I will say that I finished ""Killing Time"" merely because I felt it MUST get better at some point. It never did.Instead of inflicting it upon others I gave it to my 2 rabbits who use it as a chew toy.They are enjoying it more than I did."
1,Shame Shame Shame,I loved The Alienist and Angel of Darkness and I wonder why an author would allow his work to be abridged on tape and go so far as to read it himself. I listened to this book and was so disappointed that he seemed to skip over detail and ignore the wonderful fullness that the characters in his previous books evoked. It was not until the end that I realized Carr had allowed the ever money grubbing Simon and Shuster to abridge his usually excellent work - AND HE READ THE NASTY THING. This turned an otherwise interesting book into a one dimensional ecological diatribe with no interesting characters and I didn't care what happened at the end. Too bad for Carr. I thought he had some promise as an interesting and unique author who would not sell out to monetary interests. (Sigh) Another one down the drain.........
1,pass...,"You notice how this book does not have the ""look inside the book"" like most books on Amazon.com? Yet it's been out for years? This is intentional folks! If you look inside this book you will not want to buy it.I was SO disapointed when I got this book. I loved the title, cover picture and it sounded like a great idea. Yet when I got it and opened it up it was the most boring and worst kids book I think I have ever come across. And most of the stuff in there is more related to the environment, not to vegetarianism.I'm still smarting over losing my money on this one!"
1,Save the money,This has to be the worst book for vegetarian kids that I've come across. It doesn't get any more bland and unexciting than this. Save your money.
4,A classic in an over stimulating era.,"A wonderful book. This is not a toddlers story book, with 3 letter words that rhyme and bright colored pictures to make up what the story lacks. This is a childrens book (8,9,10,11) to help them understand why they may choose to be vegetarian.Like many wonderful classic books it is full of charming, black and white art. The book touches on animals feelings and enviromental issues on why someone may choose to be vegetarian. Good not only for vegetarian kids but also for other kids to get an understanding/acceptance of others."
1,Yuck yuck and more yuck,"I read the prior reviews and was sold on the book. How disapointing once I got it! This book is for kids? Please, it is so lame and unatractive to children. It's black and white and boring and dull. Save your money!"
5,lug nuts were perfect,"lugs as advertised, very nice replacement for the stock lugs from the 87 IROC Camaro. anyone who has the stock lugs should think about replacing with these."
5,FUNKTASTIC!,This is the best funkin' CD i have heard in ages a must for any funk soul brother! Anyone familiar with DJ Tonie Walsh of PowderBubble & H.A.M. fame will love this. Buy it now!
3,"Nice grooves, silly theme","Not an epic production on the level of ""Mothership Connection"" or ""Clones of Dr. Funkenstein"". Though the playing is strong, this recording shows the Parliament/Funkadelic machine starting to lose those creative juices."
3,Underwater Funk,"I have trouble listening to this album all the way through. Parts of it live up to the album's title, laying down some serious funk. Other parts take the kind of extended puns Parliment is famous for and drive them into the ground. For this reason, The Motor Booty Affair has a bit of a Sesame Street Flavor to it. But songs such as the title track, Aqua Boogie, and Liquid Sunshine straddle the line between the raw funk of some of Parliment's previous records and the jazzy funk of Herbie Hancock, and the result is unsurpassed in the genre. But I can't even listen to the song Your a Fish (and I'm a water sign). Where Parliment tries to be soulful on this album, they sound hollow and deflated. But when the groove is there, it is unsurpassed."
3,It's got to be (not especially) deep,"After the success of Parliament ""space theme"" albums, George Clinton, quite rightly, figured it was time for a departure to a new and different kind of space -- underwater. Lots of good ideas that just don't work well musically or lyrically. ""Aqua Boogie"" and ""Rumpofsteelskin"" are the strongest songs and are quite funny and dance-able. The rest of the album is good to ok.Keep in mind that this was the point that George was distributing the best songs to all of the members of the ParliamentFunkelicmentThang empire. Thereby, insuring that each group had at least one hit. If you were to assemble all of the best songs from this time from each member of 'the empire', you'd have one helluva album. This explains why there is so much mediocre material on this one."
5,FUNKIEST PARLIAMENT CD,"I pretty much have all of the Parliament/funkadelic/bootsy/parlet/brides of funkenstein cd's/LP's and I have to say that Motor Booty affair is the most satifying. I mean the music is hot the song concepts are so imaginative that this Cd literally transports you into another world. It's like you listen to this CD and you become Alice in Wonderland tumbling down the rabbit hole. Many other reviewers say Water sign is ""skippable' or just filler, but to me this has to be the best Funk Love songs next to Bootsy's May the force be with you and I'd rather be with you. The Cd is banging from start to finish with a whole underwater concept that ties all the songs together. They don't and probably won't make music like this anymore. So I encourage all music fans to purchase this CD as a time capsule, so when you're tired of listening to all of the generic crap on the radio you can listen, and remeber when......"
5,Old school funk.,"While it doesn't have the best of Parliament, I bought this album because growing up this was one of my favorite albums of the era. If your a fan of the late 70's style of funk or George Clinton you will find something to enjoy."
4,Simple and accurate,"This is a fairly pedestrian item as survey equipment goes. No frills or fanciness. But for the builder or small-time contractor, it does what it claims, does it well, and is affordable. The instrument is accurate in gimmick-free fashion. I'm most impressed with the high quality of the level itself. The optics are very clear and can be focused from beyond the limits of accuracy to pretty darn close-up. The leveling system is machined brass, solid and effective. The stadia rod, though a bit short at eight feet, is well made of extruded aluminum, and is perfect for an average building site. A taller rod would be desirable in order to work effectively in hilly terrain. The tripod, though in some places constucted of cheaper materials (to keep the package affordable), is still solid and reliable.I have a consumer-grade laser level that I'll probably only use rarely now that I have the real thing.Recommended."
3,"Nice Try, Ross","I gotta give Ross credit for trying but this CD just doesn't cut the mustard in my book. Although there are fleeting moments of driving three finger pickin, most of the tracks just deadpan lame. The western spin is a novel twist for bluegrass banjo but unfortunately, it falls flatly on the ear."
4,great case,I have tons of old lp's that were getting shufled around. Now I stored them all. Case sits upright and I have a smallamp on top of it instead of a stand. Its great for dual purpose
2,Great vacations for your Dog,"This book is many steps below the capabilities found in Kathleen and Robert Fish's Book: ""Pets Welcome"".In fact there are many locations in Great Vacations which do not accept any dogs or only one. I would strongly recommend Pets welcome or the AAA ""Traveling With Your Dog "" before this book."
4,Good Stuff,"This is a fun, crazy, creative and wonderful cd. I was introduced to The Cramps only a few months ago late at night while watching an indie music channel. At first I was a bit surprised by the stage presence, but after seeing the video for ""She Said"" and ""Goo Goo Muck"" I have to say, it's one of the best things about music. Lux Interior is a complete joy to listen to, his crazy style and stage antics grow on you and before you know it you have their songs in your head. Sadly it seems not a lot of people know about The Cramps. I do hope this cd and this band get the recognition they deserve.Definitely pick up this cd for some good music.Noteworthy songs from the cd: Garbageman, New Kind of Kick, She Said and Human Fly."
5,Rockabilly Kings!!!,"I have been a loong time fan of the Cramps. If you love that good punk/rockabilly garage music, then the Cramps should be on the top of your list. This band is so underground and under rated it is sad. This album is just a small fraction of the great music the Cramps have produced. Buy this album then go see them live before they are no longer around. Their stage show will shock and entertain."
5,Classic Cramps,I bought this CD years ago and it's still good today. Physcobilly is a perfect term to describe these guys. Their music certainly grows on you the more you listen.
2,Some of the worst music ever,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this trash. This was recommended to me by a friend and I don't see why. Nearly every track from ""Garbage Man"" to ""Uranium Rock"" was painful to listen to. Don't waste your money on this crap."
4,Good to great collection of The Cramps early years,"For those who never heard of the Cramps, and there are too many of you, the music was great fusion of rockabilly, surf rifts, and punk with lyrics largely inspired by science fiction and monster B-movies circa 1962. Their live shows are legendary, which is good since I've always found their recorded work somewhat uneven. They have incredible longevity for what could easily have been a throwaway novelty act.This is a good collection of their early work. Highlights for me are Garbageman, Save It, and Human Fly. Other songs are good to OK, and range from just plain silly (She Said) to a tad disturbing (TV Set). In my opinion, the Cramps don't deserve the godlike worship they've received in some places, including previous reviews. But they are way underappreciated, and this is a good place to start if you're new to them."
4,best unknown band ever!,"That's what music is all about.Having good time,listen to people doin'drugs and noticing these guys kick ass like no one before.This is not my type of music but this band deserve major attention from all major boozers around.Only time will tell they were the best band ever known by human kind."
4,Great Measurment Rod; However...,"I just bought this measurment rod and it is a great investment, the unit is solid and eveything the description says it is. However I was under the impreshion that it would be like a tape measure with complete 1/8"" marks, it only has 1/4"", 1/2"" & 3/4"" marks, the rest is left up to your interpretation of what or where the 1/8"", 3/8"", 5/8"" & 7/8"" marks should be. I bought this item so I could get my foundation layout as presise to level as could be and was a bit disappointed when I had to guess on the 1/8 marks;I did enjoy working with my new transit level and rod. This is a solid rod and if you are not as perticular as I it will work great."
5,Good prenatal dvd,"I am in my 2nd trimester and started using Stott Prenatal Pilates on the Mat dvd and I think it's great. I usually work out 2-3 times a week and do many different types of workouts from spin class, bikram's yoga, free weights, to kick boxing. I am not super buff or anything, but eat pretty well and like a good workout. Having suffered a miscarriage last year, my doc told me to take it easy my first trimester and do light exercising if I wanted to the rest of my pregnancy. I did not exercise during the first trimester so I've been very anxious to start doing something..anything!What I love about this dvd is that it is 30 minutes, so you get a full workout in a short amount of time. Plus, all you really need is a floor to do the exercises on. This workout definitely wasn't hard for me, but then again I'm just looking for something light to keep my body moving. I would highly suggest it for anyone looking for a good prenatal exercise."
3,Not a great workout,I was really expecting a good workout after reading some of the reviews but this is not much of a workout at all.
2,its OK,"This dvd is just ok for me, I prefer the instructor to be pregnant. Its a bit boring, and for some reason after I finish it, my back hurts, which I have never had happen to me with the 10min prenatal pilates dvd. My opinion is to get the 10min solutions and skip this one which costs more"
1,Vasconcelos was a pure racist!!,"Um, does no one realize that Vasconcelos thought black people were dirt and that the best they could do was mix with other races to ultimate disappear? No one mentions this very open and clear viewpoint, and unfortunately this does not speak well of any of you.This 'mix until you disappear policy' has been in effect in terms of afro-latinos for a very long time,but no one wants to talk about this.Vasconcelos should not be lauded for his racist views no matter how flattered spanish/indian mixed people feel by his hooey."
3,I was disappointed because...,"I had just finished reading the first Ellie, loved it and got right into this one, only to feel ""What happened here?"" at the end of this book.For a character like Ellie, who began with such a strong feeling of ""doing the right thing"", which was maintained throughout to the detriment of her relationship with David, to not even breath the name Santoro at the end of this book, left me speechless, left me looking to see if I inadvertently skipped a page, and ultimately I had to give it the three star rating above.I'll try one more of these (only thru the library) and see if Ms. Hellmann picks up the ball and gets to the goal line...sorry about this."
2,Confusing,"Unlike her Easy Innocence, which was very good, this book is confusing & the solution was unsatisfactory. The author threw out a lot of irrelevant stuff to create intrigue but in the end, if one reads carefully, the conclusion made some of them inconsistent & unconvincing. Also this whole idea of a criminal who has so much ability & resourcefulness is kinda absurd."
2,Cheap plot,"I read her first book and it was a great story. Very well crafted; so this is a big disappointment. The plot is cheap, it's like she had a deadline and no book, so she threw this one together. Using terrorism doesn't guarantee a decent book. If nothing else where were the editors?"
2,Inferior Remixes,"I had been listening to my 40 year old copy of the ""More Today Than Yesterday"" album recently and bought this CD expecting the songs to sound better, but unfortunately, I will have to be happy with my old copy. The songs on this CD have been remixed and are inferior to the original 60's mixes. The remix seems to have killed the life of the excellent drumming in the songs from the ""More Today Than Yesterday"" album. The drums are set back further in the mix and muddied up with added reverb and low end EQ. There are similar problems with the vocals as well.I don't always favor 60's music that has been remixed from the original multi-tracks, but you at least expect it to have improved fidelity. These mixes were just poorly done. The only benefit of these new mixes was late fade-outs on a few of the songs; getting to hear 10 to 15 extra seconds of an ending refrain."
5,"Mysterious and haunting, filled with beautiful sounds","Whoa! This soundtrack is really something. A definite must have. Joe LoDuca has created a wonderful and thematic score for the absolute BEST film of 2001. Although the main theme isn't used enough it comes thru best in tracks 3,4,20 and 21(Once).Many of the other tracks either evoke a bizarre Danny Elfman style (Track 5) or are atmospheric, tension tracks used in scenes of mystery. It is in these, basically empty, tracks that the CD fails but they are bearable whenever the secondary theme kicks in.This CD is hardly ever out of my player and if you are a fan of the movie or even if you just love great music then this is for you."
3,A fine performance by Randolph Scott!,"OK, disclaimer. I have a positive bias toward Randolph Scott's westerns. He always gives a fine performance, some better than others, and I always enjoys his films. He's somewhere between Cary Cooper and John Wayne in the western pantheon -- a rare talent.Here he shoulders the load of the film doing what he can with the material at hand. It's not a *great* film but it *is* a very enjoyable one, given the limitations of the story. This is one of the early Scott-Brown films and I think they're just getting into stride. It's an interesting story that moves along at a good pace, so break out the popcorn and enjoy!Three and half stars and recommended. I'm glad to own a DVD of this film and thank Columbia for releasing it!"
1,If I had my way it would be -10!,"This sucks! It doesn't even work, I followed all the instructions did everything I was suposed to, and it did not WORK! DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,Does not work with Intel-based MACs,"Device won't work with my new mac mini (intel-based mac). Have been told by tech-support that they are working on a driver for this, and they have no due date.Con - One design flaw I recognized in the hardware, there is no light to tell you that is powered on and running (this could be due to no software to drive it), and there is no way to tell that the hardware is powered up at all.Pro - On a good note, the thing makes a decent paper weight as I wait for the software! :)"
2,very disappointed,"We were very impressed at first by this gadget's neatness and easy storage but on our very first attempt at using it we were very disappointed. Either because of its single speed [2 speeds only because it has speed 1 and pulse] or because of a lack of power we found it unable to puree or grind. It cannot make chutneys or, I would assume, frozen drinks because it cannot grind properly. It is not good for indian dishes. It would be ok to puree soft things like boiled fruit or vegetables. I did not try it's chopping/grating attachments. Overall It could not do what all I had thought it could."
2,Worked great until it broke!,"I loved my food processor and used it every weekend. Then after a few months, the plastic ring that keeps it from leaking broke. I'd still love the food processor if I could ever find out how to replace the broken part. Unfortunately, I didn't keep any of the info that arrived in the package and have no clue how to find a new part and have not had any success so far searching the Internet. I hope I don't have to buy a new one. If I can ever find a replacement part, I'll buy several because I want to keep using this product."
3,Too little spent on each pianist,"For a book that's over 500 pages, Schonberg's The Great Pianists spends too little time on each pianist. Major 20th century figures are dealt with in a page or less. Liner note sleeves are more informative. It's too bad, too, because what's there is interesting, with biographical and technical insight that still is accessible and makes for great page-turning. There just isn't enough of it. Or, put another way, seminal figures don't get much more space than minor ones. Still, this is an interesting book, and a great general reference, especially for pianists who are relatively obscure today. I'd just suggest sampling before buying."
2,Fluff,"I don't grasp what all the 5 and 4 Star reviewers had in mind with their ratings.Three hundred of the five hundred pages are dedicated to pianists who left no recordings, meaning that this portion can be of little interest to the music lover/record collector - unless you just want to fritter away time reading anecdotal stuff. Of those who recorded, references to their output are often vague and unspecific. You will look in vain for piano greats such as Lipatti, Edwin Fischer, Gyorgy Cziffra, Weissenberg, Yves Nat, Kovacevich, Ogden, Guller, Leslie Howard, Charles Rosen, Yudina. Instead, you get treated to eleven pages of Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Very funny. No wonder history hasn't been kind to many former Pulitzer Prize winners."
5,The great pianists,"The most fascinating book I have so far read on this topic. Amusing, accurate, solid, and objectively written, full of humour and anecdotes that make its reading real fun. A turn-pager that one can read at any time and regardless of the page. A must for piano lovers. I look forward to reading other books from the same author."
5,Must read. Even if you do not listen to classical music...,"I have read this book many times since I was first introduced to it in 1984. The book is about classical pianists, their styles and piccadelloes intermingled with the author's opinions. The writing is great. Yes, as some reviewers have opined, certain facets of the art have been treated too briefly. But one cannot expect an academic tome in a book directed to the general public. I found the book very educational and entertaining. If you have had no classical music training, such as myself, you will learn quite a bit from the book. If you are a classical pianist this book will whet your appetite to plunge further into your love of music. A great addition to your library."
4,His near-perfect debut album.,"While not as powerful as albums like ""A Dream Fulfilled"", ""Moods"" or ""Love's The Place To Be"" Will's self-titled debut CD includes such beautiful Quiet Storm gems as ""Dancing In The Moonlight"", ""Free"", ""Do You?"" and ""Sending Out An S.O.S."". I highly recommend this CD to all Will Downing fans."
2,Major Cheese,I do like the whole family of Pizza in it's many forms. But the 3 to 4 star guitar playing is ruined by an overdose of cheesy reverb One or two tunes would benefit from the effect AT HALF the dose! Many of the other tunes are rendered horrific from the smothering cheese.
4,Not- so-reconditioned Bosh jig saw,"I recieved the saw on time and looken good. However, when I tried to put in the blade, I coulden't because it was locked in at the closed position. Apperantly it needed further reconditioning. I sent it in for repair's and it came back in short order. It now works fine. fyi- It would be nice if there was a blade included with the saw.Cam Stapel"
5,"The"" only ""Jig saw","Anyone who uses tools for a living knows that there are tools recognized as undeniably the best, and this is one of them. As far as Jig saws go this one stands alone. The other model with automatic blade lock is lacking in how tightly the blade is fixed , and therefore cannot be recommended. Smooth is the word, both the way it runs and the cuts it makes. In a past life I cut letters out of plywood for signage, as demanding as it get for jigsaw work,and this one never let me down. Slap in a fine finish blade and you barely need to sand... Now days I cut out sink openings, radius deck corners, do cut outs in decking and subfloors. Everytime I use my Bosch, I marvel at how well it is made,how wonderfully it runs, and what a good investment it was."
5,The best jig saw in the world,"I've used a lot of jig saws and this one, by far, is the best one ever. It was reconditioned but I couldn't tell the difference from new."
3,Bosch jig saw,"The 1587AVSK-46 is a well built tool. I bought it to replace my 30 yeras old and mechanically much sturdier Craftsman saber saw which stopped working when its switch gave up and could not be replaced because the required switch is no longer available.I have used the Bosch just briefly, and while it cuts fine with a correctly selected blade,I had a hard time getting the OEM Bosch blades seated and properly fixed in the blade holder (plunger). The Bosch screw-less blade fixation design, which is also used by other tool makers, leaves a lot to be desired. It is much less positive and rigid than an old fashioned set-screw blade holder design."
2,disappointed,I ordered this for my son for Christmas. I wish all of the information had not gotten thrown away because I would have sent it back. I chose to order this one because it was bigger that the aquariums we had found in stores. The aquarium is very flimsy. I am not sure how it is even going to hold water. Maybe when the tadpoles get here it will be more fun. Lesson: Bigger isnt always better.
1,do not buy!,I bought two tadpoles for this set. Both died. I had bought this set with a grant for my classroom. All it taught my students was death. The tadpoles did not develop at all. Currently we are using the Grow a frog kit. The tadpole has all his legs after two weeks! It is a better set.
2,get a 10 gallon aquarium instead!!,"I inherited this ""habitat"" when I got my current teaching job. I too feel it is way too flimsy and that the tadpoles don't have enough room (they kept swimming onto the banks and had to be rescued) AND it gets dirty way too quickly. It was set up in January and as of Memorial Day, the tadpoles were tiny and had no signs of getting legs. Plus it was hard for my preschoolers to actually see them. After bringing them home for the summer, I put them into a 10 gallon aquarium. They have grown quite a bit in the last couple weeks and both of them finally have legs. Plus they are a whole lot easier to watch. For $10 more, you can get the entire 10 gallon starter kit complete with a filter, plants etc."
5,It's OK,"The habitat does look flimsy, but I would think that whith such a small frog it really shouldn't matter. And besides, using a soda bottle would be quite stupid once the tadpole turns into a frog. My tadpole order form was sent on November 27 and my tadpole isn't here yet. But I'm not at the end of my rope <yet>."
5,Very Educational,My son got it for his birthday in 1998. It came 2 weeks after we sent in the slip. Both frogs are still alive and my little [son] loves them.
3,"Do not have tadpoles yet, but lost instruction book!","My son is dying to get the tadpoles, but has to be patient. In the meantime, we lost the instruction book! Can someone tell me where I can find one or let me know how to set it up. Does it need anything besides water? At the pet store, they insisted that frogs need heat, humidity, a moss bed, wood chips, vitamins sprinkled on the live food, etc! That would cost a fortune! I seem to remember that we need bottled water. Any other details would be greatly appreciated! Thanks."
1,Cheap imitation.,"I purchased this for my 5yr old son for Christmas and when we opened the box, We were disgusted at the fact that someone would sell this flimsy piece of garbage. The clear plastic is so thin and flimsy, it buckles when you pick it up. The clear plastic was cheaply glued to the brown base and when we took it out of the box, they separated. Both the base and the clear plastic are made out of the same flimsy plastic that probably wouldn't hold up a month. I regret not going to my local Books-A-Million since they have the hard plastic habitat. This was a big disappointment."
1,He should be paddled,"I am a kayak instructor and guide in Florida, and also an avid reader. At a recent get together with other guides and instructors, someone got out this book and suggested that we read some sections out loud to each other- (she said we would see why soon).After we stopped laughing, I became somewhat concerned- some of the information regarding paddling skills, equipment use, and safety were flat- out WRONG AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. I would highly recommend against anyone ever using this book!"
1,Can't tell a book by its cover,"I bought this to gain information (campsites, currents, hazards, etc.) about paddling specific locations in Florida. The first half of the books was generic babble about camping, fishing, clothing, and a few other irrelevant topics, and dubious information at that.Not finding what I wanted or what the book title would have you believe is the content, I skipped to the index to find the locations of interest. They were either completely omitted or were only mentioned in passing with a few sentences under geography or some other section. There are no maps (save for one small stretch where the authors might actually have some knowledge of), no camping info, no paddling conditions, no reference to area resources - pretty much no anything. This is a fraud."
1,Trash,"I bought this stroller in Waltz model that was made in 2007. After less than a year of normal use, the canopy started to slide off so my husband had to zip tie it on. Then a few months later the bracket for the foot rest broke off. I paid almost $300 for this ""top of the line"" stroller and all I got was garbage! To make matters worse, I called zooper for customer service and they basically told me ""too bad"". They won't cover any of it, won't send me a replacement part. The guy barely spoke English and was not helpful at all. Stay away from any zooper products! You will get ripped off and pay for something that is going to extremely disappoint you. Graco products are so much better for your money."
3,Sun kills the sliders,"I received one of these as part of a package for receiving internet satellite service for my RV five years ago. It has worked like a charm. Light weight, easy to setup and easy to store for travel.I hang a 5 gallon water jug from the center to protect against the wind. Some cheap suction cups will keep the legs from sliding on the blacktop. Never had a problem and we have been in some strong winds.Only problem is that the sliders for the lower legs will oxidize, crack and break in the sun after a while. Next time I paint them with a UV resistant coating."
2,Not professional grade,"I got this to use with a new laser level as my old one has vanished. I understand that I didn't choose several of the higher priced ones... it's hard to tell the difference online. This is VERY light and the leg extensions slide through plastic guides. The top is cast and the finish is not impressive. I feel uncertain about placing a $1000 laser on top of this. If you are a professional in the building trades, my suggestion is to get something more substantial."
5,CST/berger tripod,"CST/berger 60-ALQCI20-O 5/8-Inch 11-Threaded Flat Head TripodI was looking for a heavy tripod for a large telephoto camera lens, but didn't have a large pile of funds to purchase one. When I received this unit I put a 1/4 inch aluminum plate on top and a couple of spacers to raise the mount above the 5/8 stud. Then put a cut off 3/8 bolt inside the hollow center of the original mounting stud to attach a gimbal head. I have been out a couple of times to photograph some local swans in a breeze, so far it appears to be pretty stabil. I painted the orange, flat black and mounted a hardware store dual level on the plate.I have approximately $80 in it not including the gimbal mount."
5,"Smart, Sensitive, and Subtly Joyful","Josh Ritter is simply entertaining! I see about 30-40 live shows each year and I am most impressed with his smart, yet sensitive, lyrics. His tuning is unique. The combination tugs at your soul and reminds one to celebrate both the joys and angst of everyday life, everyday love. Josh obviously invests his heart in his music and he has a very charming presence.You'll feel as though you were invited to listen in on private back porch sessions. I heartily recommend Josh Ritter's CDs."
5,Only thing better is live...,The only thing better than Josh Ritter's albums are seeing him live. I highly recommend you take a listen. It's story-telling with music.
4,This is a great CD!!,This is a great CD and I encourage anyone who like folk style music to pick it up! Josh Ritter has a great voice and an incredible talent for writing songs! I know that anyone who buys this CD will be instantly hooked!
5,Damn Right is a must!,"Mr. Vegas comes off of a not so good debut album of ""Heads High"" to bring u a great follow-up, with ""Damn Right."" Complete with many hot, dark beats, Mr. Vegas proves he's a great Deejay when it comes to dancehall reggae. The best songs are ""How about that"" and ""Dem Fraid,"" among others. It's worth buying..."
1,It doesn't work,"I spent 2 hours trying to connect XP and W2K machines using FireNet with no luck. I eventually gave up, since it's not worth the hassle."
4,Excellent recorder,"This unit is extremely well built. The dubbing feature is easy to use and my 11 years old son is doing well with it without using the manual. The editing from the video camera is also easy to perform but it will take getting used to it . The Dv link in the front is a great feature if you have a digital video camera like Digital-8 or mini DV. Recording from the cable or Sattelite is easy , but using the timer is somewhat complicted. Overall this machine compares well with the more expensive Panasonic and JVC. Definetley a great value for the money. The manual is difficult to follow but not as bad as many other recorders out there.Pictur quality on play back is great and it is an excellent progressive DVD player if you have an HDTV"
4,Great value for the money,"I've had this unit for more than a month now and have copied lots of old VHS tapes to DVD and it works great. It is fairly easy to use and the manual is understandable, but I've only needed the manual to find out about the more advanced features--all the basic stuff was easy to figure out without the manual.I don't have it connected to an HDTV or a nice sound system, so I can't comment about the progressive scan or audio quality. I have taken the DVDs created as copies from tape and played them on my home theater system and the sound has transferred nicely.All in all, for $130 it has met and exceeded my expectations."
2,A little disappointed,"I read this book with increasing interest wondering how it would all come out. By the end, I was dissappointed and felt such a topic would have been better served had three women ""strong"" in their separate faiths rather than middle-of-the road had written of their experience. I say they were not strong in their faiths for one, because the Muslim and Jewish women did not even attend their respective temples/synagogues except infrequently and admitted they were not the norm for their faiths. The Christian was not knowledgable enough, in my estimation, in Christian doctrine. I would love to see this book done with a strong Muslim, strong Jew, and a strong Christian rooted in the scriptures."
5,The Faith Club,I found the scope of the journey shared by the three women of different and differing faiths caused me to reflect on what has influenced me from my own religious past. I also found myself reflecting on what do I really believe today versus what creeps into my vocabulary. I found it hopeful that I too could move beyond what I am into a world where I find hope for a faith based more on God's goodness and less on human judgment.
4,A Religous Journey with The Faith Club,"As a person facing my own questions about faith and spirituality, this book was a welcome guide in my search for religous clarification. All the woman are extremely insightful and knowledgeable. They deal with the often taboo subject of religion tastefully, while still delving into the most intimate questions. This book was a great tool in reaffirming my religous beliefs and in developing a new found tolerance of other religions. What a comfort to know that even these highly successful women face uncertainty in their religous beliefs. In reading this book Ranya, Priscilla, and Suzanne, become guides on an amazing religous journey."
1,Waste of time!,"I was excited to read this book and learn about these three different religions, but all three of the women had such nominal faith that there was nothing to learn. Actually, they really didn't have any faith at all. All three chose to pick the parts of their religion that they liked and threw away what they didn't; thus creating their own ""type"" of Christianity, Judaism, and Muslim faith, and presenting inaccurate portrayals of them all. In fact, it was more about their cultures than their faith, but even that was something they weren't sure of. They never really were convicted by anything. Sure, they found a comfortable way to deal with their faiths but no true devotion to the god of their faiths. Very disappointing and misleading.A better title would have been the subtitle itself, Three Women Search for Understanding."
4,Understanding Other Faiths,"The highlight of this book for me is the courage of each woman to put their faith,their customs,their stereotypes,their religious weaknesses and strengths out in the open. Through their constant discussions you are led to an understanding of each woman's code of life. The focus is on what unites all three religions."
5,Faith Club,I found this book to be wonderfully readable with a huge message that needs to be shared by millions. It is such a profoundly simple way to move to peace. Not only do they share their personal experiences they give guidance as to how each of us can use their model and transform the world!
4,So liked am purchasing a second copy!,"I always keep books I like so that I can reread them at a later date. However, I must have loaned my original copy to someone and did not get it back. And, because I enjoyed this book so much I had to purchase another copy. Being a cradle Catholic I have never been exposed to other religions. I found this book informative and entertaining with many thought-provoking discussions. I have recommended it many times to others. In fact, we actually read it and discussed it in my book club several months ago. It definitely presented the three religions in an understanding and insightful manner."
4,The Faith Club,This book is very informative and gives one good insight into the three faiths and how they compare. It does get a little tedious here and there but is still worth the time it takes to read it.
1,The F,This book could not hold my attention. I found the authors to be knowledgeable yet tedious in their problems and I could just not relate to their lives and personal problems. I read about 100 pages and then put the book down. I was reading it for a discussion group and just could not go back to finishing it.
1,A Book Full of Misconceptions & Falsehoods,"This book was written by three well intended women of different faiths; however, each of the women was not only ignorant of the other's religions but of their own, too. They write mostly about their own feelings and perspectives. Unfortunately, their perspectives are very limited. All three are totally uneducated in the field of religion. They modify their viewpoints and religion to fit the needs of this book. I bought the book because of the rave reviews and I am shocked that so many people fell for this nonsense. You will learn nothing factual about any of the religions in this book. It is only pure dribble."
3,More women need to write on this subject...,"The key message of this book is that religious certainty in any form leads to fundamentalism and intolerance. But a second, and perhaps equally important message is that ALL religions and societies need women who have the confidence to take a leading role in confronting religious conflict. While I don't agree with the authors that we always need to completely understand the nuances of religious differences, or attend each other's religious services, in order to appreciate or accept (or even to tolerate) various belief systems; I do see a critical need for women to take the podium on these issues. If more women like Idliby, Oliver and Warner speak out against prejudices and stereotypes -- society will be better served. (The reviewer is author of ""Top Cops: Profiles of Women in Command"" and ""Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU."")"
4,We need more books like this.,There needs to be more dialog between individuals of faiths. The misconceptions and stereotypes we hold build such tall walls between us and as these brave persistent friends show we can develop a deep abiding love and acceptance of one another beyond differences of faith because we are all human and share more in common then we have differences.
3,moivng account but historically challenged,"While the story of three very different women and their bonding is inspiring, many statements were accepted whole without a lot of research. There are a number of factual errors espoused by the authors. It's a worthy effort, but should be read as a moving account of their relationship and not as a factual rendering of history."
4,Very Helpful,"I wasn't crazy about the title: It sounded as though it was going to be 'chic lit'. But it was anything but. I think many of us wonder about people of other faiths, and how they handle life's big hurdles. It's hard to get people to talk about such things in an ordinary social setting. But in The Faith Club these three women courageously explored their differences - and took joy in their similarities. For me, as a Christian, to be allowed into the life and the mind of a Muslim woman on such a deep level was a privilege - and a real eye-opener."
2,Should have been a great true story!,"I like to learn everything I can about different religions but I became very bogged down in reading this book. I found the suggestions at the end of the book for starting your own ""faith club"" actually more interesting than the story."
3,Reassuring but Insights Rather Basic,"It's reassuring to read the story of these three women from different faiths who become friends. Each of them seems to have a ""hot button"" issue that makes her rather prickly toward her friends when the subject comes up (e.g. Israel for the Jewsih woman, fundamentalist Islam for the Muslim, distrust of her ""majority religion"" for the Christian), and it is ""educational"" to see how they overcome their gut level reactions in order to stay friends. But after awhile I got frustrated by the super-basic level of religious insight. I would recommend this book to people who know almost nothing substantive about comparative religions, for they would probably learn new things. I'm rather steeped in comparative religion and found myself frustrated by these women's ignorance. Also, these woman are not necessarily ""typical"" of their faiths. It would have been better if they had sought out the input of in a few others of their faith to both broaden and deepen their analysis."
3,Women Sharing Ideas and Feelings,"Maybe it's because I am a Christian, no probably because I am a Christian, I came away from reading this book convinced that the Jewish woman was resigned in her faith, the muslim woman was resentful and defensive in her faith and the Chrstian found some hapiness and optimism in her faith."
3,Great concept,"I love what this book does: bring religious tolerance to the forefront. And there were some great ""aha!"" moment that taught me a lot. That being said, the repetitiveness of some of the conversations (from each of the three women) started to get old, quick. I understand wanting to get ""all sides of the story"", but hearing the same thing three times (in different ways) got redundant.Overall, I really enjoyed learning about the different religions."
5,Religious Tolerance,"Excellent and moving narrative of the journey of three women together, towards understanding the religious complications in today's world."
5,"The history of laudanum, morphine and patent medicines","In Arms Of Morpheus is the history of laudanum, morphine and patent medicines is revealed from the addictive growth of a drug widely available as an over the counter medicine to treat ailments ranging from boredom to a lack of creativity. Manufacturers claimed all kinds of cures from the use of morphine: In Arms Of Morpheus traces the history of such contentions and includes plenty of ads, photos, cartoons and other embellishments to make for lively general-interest reading."
4,Killer Cures,"In the Arms of Morpheus, briefly touches on the history of addiction to Opium, Morphine, Heroine and Laudanum. It seems that the good old days were good for a different reason and unknowingly people bought medicines that contained highly addictive drugs such as Opium. The author goes into a brief yet well presented book of this nasty history one that may make you think twice about your sweet innocent great grandparents."
2,Sometimes Pooh is overated.,"We received 2 of these for our daughter as gifts, and she never really liked them. She might rattle it for a few seconds, but then tosses it. She prefers rattles that she can shake vigorously and produce a loud sound. The honeybees make a soft sound and it's not very exciting. Also, I tried washing it once and water seeped in, which caused the honeybees to stick to the paper-picture of Pooh, and it's never rattled as freely since. The only educational use I've gotten out of it was to help teach my daughter colors since one side is purple and the other side is green."
1,Don't Waste your time or money,Tried these because they are so cheap. Tey are not good at clamping and you cannot see through the rings on a Ruger MKIII Hunter pistol with Simmons Prohunter scope. The REAL Weaver rings work perfectly however and are worth every penny. (Weaver See-Thru 1-Inch Detachable Rings)
3,Not that bad,I purchased this to mount a scope to my Marlin Model 60SB. The rifle has a stainless steel barrel and these rings are more of a bright silver in color. They look pretty darn good on the rifle but anything more than a cursory look easily shows that the rings are not made of stainless steel. Unlike another reviewer the finish on the set I received was fine with no marks or blemishes. The finish of the metal isn't too smooth but for the amount I paid I can't complain much. They get the job done so what more can I ask for?
3,Ok For The Price.....,"What can you expect for $6? While these scope rings are sturdy, the finish leaves much to be desired. These have just a cheap wham bam paint job on them with pits and blemishes, and the screw heads which are supposed to resemble polished aluminum, were pitted and had a black residue in them which would not come off. Obviously a bi-product of the aluminum machining process. A little dissapointed, but hey, they work."
5,This is the Best book I have seen written on this subject.,"After having read and created many projects from other books of this type, I have to say this is the best and most informative book up to date. The author not only shows us projects using many types of different needlework, she also explains the history behind them. Mostly this book is limited to the ""Victorian"" period, but it looks like she plans to produce other books along this line on other periods. Although I find this book especially to my liking, I don't think it is for everyone. Most of the projects are for the advanced needleworker with some very fine detailed oriented designs. There are patterns for using needlepoint, embroidery, quilting, netting and so on, and they consist of projects from rugs to quilts to curtains and small items. I can't wait for her next book to come out."
1,chuckles47,This trimmer is the worst thing I have every had. As long as you hold it in the upright and don't turn it from side to side the hair fall down into the vac space but turn just a little and it falls everywhere. No power in the vac system. So I would tell people not to count on it like you see on the TV stations. My old one did about as good a job as this thing.
3,OK but fell apart in the long run,"I bought this unit about 15 months ago. It worked well, ran fine and the vacuum did a pretty fair job. The handle was a bit awkward at first but I got used to it after a short time.Then things started to break. The wisker bin started to fall out, the detent buttons wore down and for the past year or so I've had to hold the handle in a specific way to keep it in. The previously reported problem with the cutter guard comming off started right away. Then the length adjustment broke. I had to epoxy the guard in a fixed position and unfortunately I epoxied it way too long. I'm looking at the new Norelco vac unit and will probably buy it.Had it held up better I'd have given it 4 stars."
1,simply terrible,"Does not vaccuum well - even when taking off a small amount of hair at a time.Because where the inlet of the vaccuum is located, it forces you to hold the trimmer at a weird angle to your face.Cheap construction as well.I'm a mechanical engineer for a product design firm - I design products for a living - this is easily in my top 5 of worst products I've ever seen."
4,The Trimmer Works Fine,"Some of the reviews for this product made me hesitant in purchasing this trimmer, but I bought it anyway and I'm completely satisfied. I find that about 80% to 90% of the hair I trim is caught by the vacuum, even though I'm not that careful about using the trimmer as directed, which is good enough for me. Overall I find the product works great and is thoughtfully designed. All of the complaints I've read (except for one that makes no sense to me) seem resolvable through reading the manual or applying common sense. Here are my responses to some of the negative reviews for this trimmer:Vacuum doesn't catch much hair: I suggest you trim by 1/8"" at a time as directed in the manual so that the cut hair isn't too long to get easily vacuumed. Also, you have to hold the trimmer right-side-up otherwise the hair won't fall near enough to the vacuum openingPatchy shave: In the manual it addresses that issue directlyGuard comes off: Don't push the guard release while shaving"
1,False Advertising,"The vacuum is not powerful enough to pick up shavings. Even the slightest tilt will cause shavings to miss the vacuum receptacle and litter your sink. Very disappointing product from leading trimmer maker Wahl. Brought mine back and got a Norelco T860, which I recommend for its Acu-Control system."
1,False Advertising,"This has got to be the worst case of false advertising ever! First of all, it doesn't vacuum like it says it does. Hair everywhere!. Second, it is not user friendly. The thing is large and it obscures your face. The stand that comes with it tips over very easily. If this was a movie I would give it two thumbs down!!!"
1,This is the worst trimmer I have ever owned!,"I saw the ads for the Trim-N-Vac trimmer and thought it was a good idea. But that is all it was an idea. The trim guard pops off in the middle of trimming(oops there's a bald spot), then when you put the guard back on, thinking that the guard is at the same trim length that it was set at when you started, suprise it is back to a number 1 while the lever says 4. On top of all that, the vacume does not have enough suction to catch 1/4 of the hair so you might as well be using a trimmer that does not have this feature and will trim even. This was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
4,works well - read the instructions!,"I still miss my rechargeable Norelco, but I needed something neater (I got sick of unclogging my drain!). I've had this trimmer for a few weeks now and can heartily recommend it. When used as recommended, it does a fine job of catching the hair in its trap. It also does a fine job trimming! I have received many compliments on the job it does on my beard."
4,Very happy with it,"This is is my second Wahl Trim N Vac. My first one lasted 5 years until the battery didn't fully recharge any more. I dropped it in the trash and purchased a new one, which works great. It vacuums a little more hair trimmings than my earlier model, but it didn't have the swivel head with the small blade at the other end, so that was a bit of a disappointment. But it works really well and I'm very happy with it. I don't find it too bulky at all."
4,"good product, poor instructions","I had to figure out how to orient the trimmer relative to my face, but once I did it worked very nicely."
2,Definitely a disposable,"The product is made of very flimsey materials and has a small cutting head. This means it cut unevenly. While the bateries are rechargeable, they are not replaceable. When the battery stops taking a charge, you must throw the razor away."
2,There are better choices,"I puchased this a couple of years ago to replace my old Wahl trimmer. I thought the vacuum was a good idea, but it's not as effective as I would have liked; there's still a mess in the sink to clean up. It is bulky and not comfortable to use. It's difficult to clean. The depth adjuster has come off a couple of times while in use. The battery failed to hold a charge after just a few months so I can only use it with the cord.As far as trimming goes, it's not a winner there either. It takes too many passes to get the job done and it doesn't trim that evenly.I've been browsing for a more satisfactory replacement and can hardly wait for this to stop working completely."
3,gets the job done,"it trims. it does what it's supposed to.it doesn't ""vacuum"" very well. i'd say about 60% of the trimmings make it into the vacuumed compartment.also, it doesn't hold a charge very well."
2,vac-trimmer,the trimmer part works great but! Still half the mess on the sink from trimmins that dont get sucked up...still have to clean up afterwords..
5,Different books or reprints?,Fort Starvation 1-- 12 1 1952Fort Starvatiom 2-- 12 2 1952Tort Starvation 3-- 1 1 1953Fort Starvation 4-- 1 2 1953Were these different books or were these reprints of the same book?
3,reviewing the book,"The book itself was fine..but they didnt not give me the right code for enter in the computers,and it didnt come with the lab book..."
1,wrong,i just wanted to let you know that my book is missing pages from 135 to 165 i wold really like to get a good one because i paid for it
3,Good value for light use rags,"These are decent shop rags for the price. They are pretty thin and have to be folded or balled up to do any significant clean-up. However, for wiping off light grease, debris, etc. I'd say they are worth it."
2,Holy Hannah!!! Please tell me there is a cheat for level 3!,"My son begged for this game, and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection. He enjoyed levels 1 & 2, but once we got to level 3 that was it! Unless you have earned the nickname ""Fast fingers"" or ""Fury Feet"" don't bother purchasing this until you rent it. I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up. Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the ""Dance Levels"" get harder from here, Good Luck!!!"
5,"Oooh, I'm so tired of this book, but my kids love it!","And isn't that the measure of a great toddler book? We have read this book over and over and over. It not only entertains my 2-year-old twins, it helps them anticipate what to expect when they go to the doctor. They like it so much that they can now 'read' it to each other, as they know whole pages by heart. Thumbs up!"
2,Terrific Tablecloths?,"Being an avid printed tablecloth collector for many years, I was happy to see that a reference book for these lovely tablecloths had finally arrived. I was very disappointed by the fact that there was not much in the way of the history of the tablecloths in this book. I was appalled at the photos of tablecloths that had not been cleaned or ironed! I have yet to order her second book, and only hope that she has paid much more attention to details when it comes to photographing these wonderful old tablecloths!"
2,Where's the Beef?,"The book has beautiful pictures of a nice assortment of vintage tablecloths but absolutely no history or other information regarding them. It was almost like looking at someone's home videos. Rather than ""here's where I've been"", it is a ""here's what I collect"". In this case a picture is NOT worth a thousand words. Too expense for the final product."
3,"Great photos, but not enough text","Although I agree with the other reviewers about the lack of text and collecting information in this book I am very happy with the book overall. The photos are clear and are great for seeing what the various colors used during the time period should look like and what color combinations were used together. It would have been very helpful if there was information included on which colors were more desirable, and which sizes were more desirable or harder to find.I am a collector of so many varied things though, that I never feel like a book is ""too much"" for the final result. Yes, it is about $30 but it is a book that I have gone back to time and again to compare with things I've seen in person.Unfortunately just about ALL of the prices are exactly the same. It almost seems as if they were better left out than to be so unimportant."
3,Damn Your Eyes,Etta is great when she gets hold of a good song. Damn Your Eyes is one of those songs.
3,Good product-bad communicator,"Good product packaged well. Seller took 4 business days to initially ship out. Amazon states products will ship in 2 business days. After 2 weeks of not receiving CD, emailed seller for tracking #. No tracking # or shipping info provided - just told not to worry. Waited, still not received. 2nd email request sent for tracking # and shipping info. Still not provided. After disputing, seller states I needed to be more emphatic with my concerns. I think asking for shipping info twice should have been emphatic enough to get direct answers to direct questions. Good product - Post Office screw up - seller could be better at providing shipping info when questioned."
5,Etta James Seven Year Itch. AWESOME,"Etta James is THE queen of R&B and this has to be one of her best ever albums. With Damn Your Eyes as the incredible song of love and addiction, so much feeling is put into this song and it's the only album of hers that this song appears. I'd Rather Go Blind is classic Etta as is Come To Mama and How Strong Is A Woman. This is a woman at the peak of her performance and listening to this album is a joy. If you only purchase one of Etta James albums I'd have to say make it this one. She is in full glorious voice."
5,Great CD,I ordered this & was very surprised at the speed in which the CD got here. Excellent service!
5,old fan,"Etta James sings, quite simply, the way these songs should be sung. She delivers the precise amount of emotion and emphasis to each note and pause. It's what sets her apart."
3,"Has potential, but falls short","The Darkness is a fairly typical story driven FPS with alot of intriguing elements added into it that make it a worthwhile play for someone who really digs the genre.Other have mentioned the good parts of Darkness, being the setting, sense of immersion, etc., and while agreeing with most of these I will quickly highlight my problems with the game.1.) Graphics - good but not fantastic, PS3 version has no excuse to not have superb anti-aliasing. Pure laziness on the developers part.2.) Gameplay - Bad guys tend to be of the ""stand in one place and shoot"" variety. Bad guy AI is severely lacking, you won't see anyone take cover or flank or anything here, dissapointing coming from games like Resistance and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.3.) Controls - Why, why why, no keyboard/mouse support? Any developer that releases an FPS on PS3 that does not have Keyboard/Mouse support is going to get griped at from me, plain and simple."
5,The darkness video game,"I am a big fan of first person shooters, mostly playing games like socom, hitman, medal of honor, etc. The darkness is the second PS3 game I have purchased, resistance being the first. I really loved this game. The graphics and music are great. The gameplay is open-ended in you can decide how to react in certain situations and can decide to take on side missions. The environment is interactive allowing you to smash and shoot stuff, throw cars, turn stuff on and off. Becuase of all this, gamers who normally don't get into first person shooters will definitely like this game.I normally don't get into the stories in video games, but this one is great. The story is just as much fun as playing the game.Overall great graphics, great environment, great story, great FPS gameplay. Not a long game to play, but you will want to play it more than once. Definitely one of my favorite games. Check it out you won't be dissapointed."
2,Why am I playing this?,"-Bad controls-Uninvolved storyFun premise, but overall is a failure to me. I sold my copy on ebay. It seems like they didn't finish it. The world is empty, and enemies are just wandering around. It seems like everyone walking on the sidewalk is just there to shoot you, seems so stupid and unrealistic. Random portals where you summon creatures from don't make sense, they're placed in the sidewalk... why?Don't waste your time and money on this game."
2,The Darkness,"This game is the antithesis of fun. It is almost painful to play. This is odd because there is no one aspect of the game that is individually bad. The graphics are good. The control scheme is solid. The voice acting is adequate. The loading is a little slow, but not worse than many other games. Somehow it all combined to make a game that is less than the sum of its parts."
1,not worth it,"This game had an interesting premise but it failed to capitalize on it. We're never given important elements of the story and the main character just seems wrong. Furthermore, the game doesn't work well as a shooter and the Darkness aspect of the game, which is what makes it unique, is difficult to use and really not that interesting. Mainly the game is just boring and shooting out all the lights gets old really fast. I wasn't able to finish the game because I lost interest. Fortunately, I paid less than $10 for it but even then it's not worth it."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...,"I have never written a review but felt compelled by my disappointment. This game is bad, very bad. The whole concept is ridiculous, you spend more time shooting lights than people. It was so boring I literally could not play it past the first few levels. Save your money, don't buy this game!"
4,Shut off the lights!,"Shut off the lights and jump into an amazing game. As a horror author, I can proudly say that this game manages to deliver an eerie yet enjoyable experience. Near the beginning of the game, you will gain THE DARKNESS. This consists of these demonic eel-snake things that come out of the side of you. They can run down streets, bite off faces, and even smash lights. There is a fantastic and gripping story to be had here, and plenty of side quests to keep you busy for hours.I rated this an 8.75. It's a must buy if you can find it, you're likely to spend less than 20 out the door as it is an earlier Next-Gen title.Horror Author Joel Krupa"
5,this was a sick game people!,I totaly enjoyed the different style this game had on an fps. the fact of having two darklings on your back and sent them out to rip someones hart out is just amazing! loved this game back when it came out. Nice and twisted fps totaly should get it!
2,Not fun,"I didn't enjoy this game at all, i would waste my money on it if i had the choice again. The gameplay isn't too fun, at first its ok, but then"
3,es pavo.. pero muy extrano!,este juego tiene muy buenas imagenes!! los graficos son exelentes!! la trama es un poco incompresible!! tambien es un juego complicado!! aunque aveces llega a ser monotono y calm con la avilidad de las culebras llamadas darkness!! no existe necesidad de disparar o correr!!... overall no a un mal juego!!! es bueno solo que un poco complicado!!si me dicen si lo recomiendo!! jajaj preferible otro juego!! resistance es lo maximo!
2,Sight unseen,"If the game is so great, why isn't there a decent trailer that shows the actual gameplay?You can go online and see reviews about how ""great"" yesterday's games were also...I can read 100 positive reviews, but I still won't buy a $60 game until I can see the darned thing - at least ONE SECOND of game play...come on, don't tell me all the marketing money was wasted on a teaser!"
4,Excellent book. Not excellent enough to pass the exam,This is an excellent book however it falls short of adequately preparing you for the exam. The books structure is logical and well thought out. The problem is the practice exam in the back of this book is well below the standard required to pass the exam.Also I think Amit is doing himself a disservice by including the PrepLogic exam with his book. It is full of inaccuracies and once again fails to reach the standard of the actual exam. For example the exam claims that the file produced when you enable tracing is a Trace.asx file??
3,"Lots of exercises, but shallow explanations","I was part of a study group that used this book. We all took the exam and all had roughly the same opinion afterward. The book has many, many exercises that can be completed in cookbook fashion. It leaves the reader wanting in terms of content though. It does not provide nearly enough explanation of the subject matter to do well in the exam. If you would like to do more than barely pass, I would suggest using this book as a companion, but not your only resource."
5,"KALANI WORKS, MS DOESN'T!!!","DON'T BOTHER WITH MICROCRAP BOOKS!! I studied using the Microsoft Self-Paced Training Books and didn't come close to passing.Bought this book based on reviews and studied from cover to cover. I PASSED!! This covers all subject matter and little intricacies of test material and test taking. There were small issues with the questions in the book.Suggestion: Take tests at Microsoft site to determine areas you need to work on, concentrate on studying those areas, go retake the tests, brush up on other areas you are good at to increase knowledge. When you feel good enough, go take the test!!I don't think the PrepLogic CD is worth anything. They have code errors in their content, applications are difficult to work with, and questions are trying to be too tricky ( not concentrating on content ).Going to buy the other Kalani books to pass the other certs."
5,"Very helpful, know C# first","I'm half-way through this book, and I'm very impressed. The excercises and their variety and applicability have been great. The side notes and practice exam questions are helpful too. Yes, this book is not for newcomers to C#. Read a beginner book first, then use this book as exam prep. The back cover of the book, which you can view on amazon website says the book is intended for those with working knowledge of C#. Unfortunately, programmer123 didn't bother to look at this and gave an unfair rating of only three stars. Not fair. This book deserves at least four stars."
4,A Good Deal,This book is very efficint. It dosn't cover the basic elemnts of the c# language. And some of the chapters are not part of the 70-316 exam. The biggest prablom of this book that it donsn't cover well enough the security issue. But all other subjects excellent.
2,Overall bad book,"This book desrevd two stars becaiuse it is specially organized for exam, compared to all other books, therefore trying to cover every topic.But (but!!!!!!), this book explains so terribly, and you will get so confused, that you will even forget what you knew before.I bought this book to save my time on preparation. But, the author usually gives very very short explanation about the particular class, and just gives very wordy 2 pages long example: the remaining part to be self-understood. I read one page of the book 5 minutes, and spend remaining 2 hours in MSDN, to find out how the code the author gave works. That is really exhausting!!!! Somebody could wonder, that there are no perfect books, and why am I so angry. The reason is, I think this book and other related books by the author were written in hurry, not concerning about how end users would understand it."
3,"Good book, but only as a booster","I read this book inside and out and barely passed the test. Only about half of the questions on the test were covered on the book. Thank goodness I did some other studying, do not rely solely on this book or you will fail!"
3,Fine - but not complete,"I had high hopes when I receivede this Laurel & Hardy classic: Finally I would get to hear the original music and sound effects. I am sorry to say that this video company has once again told us a pretty story on the back cover of the tape. Sure, the music and effects track was found on Vitaphone records, only they did not use it when they made this tape. I have compared it to other copies, and it is the same - no new materials is found on this version. So why are they telling that there are?!"
5,The Best Xena Guide Available...,"This is the ultimate Xena guide. Extremely well written! Greg Cox does an excellent job reviewing each episode with accurate facts and humerous observations. The first three seasons (I wish he would write one for seasons 4-6!) episodes are discussed along with their (possible) Mythological basis, subtex, highlights, and even an episode rating. There is also information on both Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor. If you are going to buy an episode guide this in the one to buy!"
4,A book from a fan to fans,This book has the authors own thoughts about Xena: Warrior Princess. It's funny and has some really interesting things that we're surpirising and amusing. It's well written and worth the money I spent in it.
5,Attention To Whoever Owns The Master Recording!,"Reissue this CD NOW. I do not understand what the hold-up is to reissuing this great music by one of the premiere songwriters of the 1960's. The performance by Laura on this recording IS her legacy. It is Laura at her best. There are tons of people out there who want to own a copy of this CD. They want to remember Laura as she was, singing and playing her heart out, and this CD fills that need. Laura would have wanted this. The delay must end NOW. Reissue this CD NOW!"
4,The Boys Blow Their Horns,"In this silent classic, Stan and Ollie play musicians who, at the start of the film, lose their jobs in typical fashion. When their landlady finds out they're jobless, she insists they immediately hit the streets to play for their rent money. This two-reeler has many classic scenes, two examples: watch for the ""loose salt shaker"" scene at the dinner table and for the hilarious ""pants"" sequence at the film's finale."
5,excellent and easy to use,This cutter is a great shape and easy to work with. Lines are smooth and worked well with 3 different types of dough. I highly recommend.
4,Awesome lip plumper!,"I can't believe more people haven't bought and rated this item. It's super cheap as far as lip plumpers go and it actually does seem to instantly plump my lips! It's also not sticky and very soothing and refreshing. Normally I hate wearing lip glosses on my lips because they all are so heavy and make my lips so gooey and watered down, but this stuff is different. They really do feel conditioned and plumped. I highly recommend this product. It even comes in a cute little tube!"
1,Dilly beans tough,I sent these to my parents for a gift. They found them very woody and chewy. The beans were very tough. Did not like them at all.
3,Hey this movie was good!,"Being a cheap independant film, this movie delivers. Starring Eric Roberts,and some other formiluar faces. This screen blast won't let you down. VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, NUDITY"
5,Want to understand semiconductor industry? READ THIS BOOK,"This book enabled me to understand the forces driving the semiconductor / computer industry. I have read it three times... the book is now a mess. I attacked it with a highlighter, wrote notes in the margins, talked it over with friends. Have given several copies away. Its that good. The notes and bibliography were even fun to read. Suggestion - Read Ray Kurzweils ""Age of Spiritual Machines"" after you read Microcosm."
5,Microcosm by George Gilder,This was an important summary of the 20th century revolution which led to the modern computer. George Gilder has the ability to describe history as an exciting adventure. Everyone interested in the technological revolution must read this book. Have fun.
1,I hope these predictions are more accurate than those in Telecosm,"Remember the company Global Crossing? Gilder predicted that this company would change the world and would be a sound investment for years to come. It declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter. Gilder is a carnival barker. If you look at his track record of predicting...anything, you won't waste any time reading him again."
5,Silent and Talkie,"I have both the silent version of Double Whoopee and the All-Talkie version of it, and it's a great short. I love it. I'd buy it again!"
4,"Laurel & Hardy with an ""appearance"" by Jean Harlow!","""Double Whoopee,"" a two-reeler directed by Lewis Foster in 1929, is notable because the story is by Leo McCarey and Jean Harlow makes quite an appearance: she loses the back half of her dress in a cab door. Laurel & Hardy arrive at a swank New York hotel and are mistaken for visiting royalty until they are revealed to be just doormen. Once they set to work they offend all of the guests, the local cop and the cabbie (literally giving a visiting prince the shaft). Hardy dominates most of the gags, such as the elaborate routine of signing the guest register, although the best is when Laurel is stripped to his underwear and starts ripping off everybody else's clothes. ""Double Whoopee"" is a solid Laurel & Hardy silent short, but not one of their best."
4,Great introductory textbook for college students on acoustic,Dr. Backus is a professor of physics but also a pianist and has a deep appreciation of both the intricacies of physics and the relationship of physical phenomena to musical instruments. This is a superb text for college music majors or physics majors although the latter would be disappointed by the lack of equations and obvious attempts to suit the book to music majors. I am a semi professional musician and found that this text satisfied much of my perpetual inquisitiveness about acustical instruments and how they work.
5,holyhellafunky!!!,"This album is, booty down, the best P-funk album ever made. I've been listening to them since the big bang and these tracks define what the funk is all about. They keep it fun, funky and real. They keep the booty loose and the head bobbin using everything they got, from catchy phrases (""may we bang you?--hot plasma ain't a thang..."")to Bernie's blasting horn riffs. Best track: ""May we Bang you?"" Definitely a must have for any true clone."
2,Halla stoopid is right.,"Why this is still available and Parliament's Casablanca Records swansong, the excellent ""Trumpbibulation"" is not is beyond me. That has this beat, hands down. Also, someone oughta put Bernie Worrell's ""All The Woo in the World"" on CD for those serious funk listeners like me."
1,If your vision of the Wheel of Time involves Bon Jovi...,"Then rejoice! The opening track on this CD sounds like an 80's big hair band. ""The Wheel of TIIIIIME!!!!"" Man, this is not what I'd listen to while reading the books. I was expecting some sort of classical music, maybe some chorals, a work in the vein of Basil Poledouris and his fabulous Conan the Barbarian soundtrack. This first track alone made me nearly want to break the cd in half and use the edges of it to harm myself in some way.Do yourself a favor and check out soundtracks from fantasy films. Anything by Basil Poledouris, the soundtrack from Last of the Mohicans, Dances With Wolves... those are albums that will put you more in mind of the series."
2,Eh...,"This CD wasn't terrible, just isn't the normal thing I'd listen to, and certainly not a good musical representation of the Wheel of Time novels. The inclusion of vocals was in and of itself, a flawed idea. Not only that, but there are too many cultures represented both subtly and overtly in the novels (renaissance era culture, pre-Norman, crusades-era christianity, Taoism, gypsy and gaelic, among others) that you couldn't possibly pin it down to one influence in the music. In other words, it seems like a mistake to put such emphasis on gaelic influence in the music, when in order to give a good representation of the books, you'd have to include so many other cultures as well. To be honest, if you want a soundtrack to go with the novels, I'd go for the soundtrack to the computer game. It's on the game CD as an hour or so of mp3's."
1,Worst Music Ever,"This has to be some of the worst music I have ever heard. ""Singing"" the words ""wheel of time"" over and over again is hardly what it takes to call a song a theme of something. This soundtrack not only does not suit the books at all, but is not worth listening to for any reason. There is no musical value to be found here, don't waste your time with this one."
1,Thank the light I didnt buy this,This abomination is left over from the War Of Power created in the pit of Shayol Ghul to deafen the Dragon reborn and torment us all ....I would rather kiss a trollic or run my self through with a Myrddraal's shadow blade than ever have to listen to this again.My the light save us from this horid thing.
3,"Good, but it doesn't go with the books","I don't actually own the CD, but I did listen to online samples. I personally liked the music, but it just didn't go with the book. I have always thought about the perfect Wheel of Time theme song, and well it was not here.Take my advice on this though. before you buy the CD listen to a sample online."
1,This was the cornyist thing i have ever heard,"Okay. Now I will admit that The Wheel of Time is far from being my favorite series, but i have read up to book six. When I heard this CD, the only thing i could do was laugh. It was just so corny!! I mean, the whole entire Wheel of Time Theme song with some guy sing ""The wheel of destiny"" or some... like that and that utterly annoying Wheel of Time chant chorus...it was just pathetic. Word of advice: Don't buy this CD."
4,A Soundtrack for a Book?,"A soundtrack for a book? I must admit I was a little skeptical at first. But this CD is surprisingly good. It has a slight celtic tone to it which I never really pictured WoT set to, but the music is well written and flows nicely. I really love this CD! In fact the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because I believe that nothing can beat my age-old favorites of Brahmes or Strauss."
2,Only listened to 3 30-second clips and I'm already put off,"I've known that there was a Wheel of Time soundtrack from quite a while, but I only looked into it today. I listened to the first 3 clips off Amazon, and was immediately put off buying it. The first one is basically a repetition of people chanting, ""the Wheel of Tiiiime,"" and the rest are no better. If you're expecting Celtic music or something similar, then don't buy it. You may appreciate it as music in itself, but if you are looking for music that describes the series, this isn't it. Try www.the-tinkers-song.net for some Wheel of Time music that I personally think relates to the books much more than this soundtrack - it's not authorized by Robert Jordan, but it's some decent works."
1,ImportCD Specialists review,"The CD was received damaged. We promptly returned it the same day and the record shows ImportCD Specialists received it back on Feb.16, 2010. We sent the confirmation number to them on Mar. 13th, with a follow up request on Mar.20th It is now Apr 3rd and we've received no refund, and no further correspondence from ImportCD Specialists. I will not purchase from ImportCD Specialists again."
2,"Good music, but not Wheel of Time...","I tell you first that I only heard the clips on this page. Then, I thinks it's very good music, but it sounds like it would have been better for Halo or Emperor: Battle for Dune, it's somewhat epic but too much artificial, mechanized for a fantasy saga where the newest technology is a crossbow... Buy it if you like the music, but if you are looking for something to hear while you read the books buy LOTR sondtrack."
3,wierd...,"I'm pretty much on the fence with this one. It sounds as if...well...like what everybody says it sounds like: Pink Floyd/Celtic music. Now, by itself or on the game I like the music just fine. But when you try to apply the cd to the books, it doesn't really work. I was kinda thinking somthing more along the lines of some dramatic, well-written classical type music...like on the Lord of the Rings movies. Lets face it. Classical music and fantasy go together real well."
3,"Yes,but it's not the soundtrack to the book!",Everybody here thinks the music on the Robert Berry CD is the soundtrack to the book series The Wheel of Time.NO!It's the soundtrack to the PC game from 1998 with the same name!I happen to have both and I can confirm the music is basically the same.So my guess is the makers of the PC game asked Berry to record the music for the game and some stuff got left out.He decided to record some tracks with members from Celt Rock group Tempest (great band!) to make it complete/some money.Sure the album isn't great but there's some nice tracks anyway.Nod bad.Not great.
1,Gleemen do not use synthesizers,"None of these songs are particularly inspired, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it was way too modern for the tone of the books. Electronic instruments and 80's-style power ballads have no place in fantasy universes.Should've gone with a Knight's Tale format if he wanted to make it modern. At least you can giggle along to the fact that it would suggest it KNOWS it's inappropriate.Besides, who hasn't read the massive One Power battles with ""Rock You Like A Hurricane"" in the back of their mind?!"
1,More Folksy then Epic,"I supposed I had some preconceived notions about what the soundtrack to the Wheel of Time series should be. Something on par with the soundtracks of Fellowship of the Ring, Gladiator, Conan or 13th Warrior was what I envisioned being suited to the epic scope of Robert Jordan's work. Hey, even the soundtracks from Scorpion King (score), Army of Darkness or The Mummy would be more suited in my mind.Its not that the music in the Wheel of Time soundtrack is bad, it just sounds like folk music. The opening theme has what I can best describe as a ""cheesy"" feel to it, repeating the words ""Wheel of Time"" over and over again would be like the opening theme for Lord of the Rings being someone singing ""Lord of the Rings"" over and over again, pretty silly when you think about it. The music also sounds thin; few instruments, light production and no real emotion. If you're a fan of folk music, you might like this, but if you're a fan of epic, sweeping soundtracks, stay away."
1,not worth the price of the amount of power required to play.,"This cd has officially become the worst in my collection, and I have britney spears. The music doesn't fit the books in the slightest. A masochist wouldn't listen to this music. It has no relation to the series, there would be no difference if a first year uni student studying audio engineering took this soundtrack and dubbed it to a black and white oriental film. The quality of sound recording is abhorrent. You can almost hear the scratches on the vinyl. RJ must have been stoned the day he approved this soundtrack. Or unconscious."
3,Not what one might expect.,"Ok, I was skeptical as well. The music is inappropriate for a ""true"" Wheel of Time setting.. synthbass and electric guitars aren't exactly evocative of Randland. But it was a good CD, for those who like progressive rock. Someone called it a 'celtic Pink Floyd', which sums it up nicely. Think an edgier Enya. Robert Berry does a fantastic job of setting mandolins and violins to rock percussion and Metallica-sounding guitar riffs.A couple of the tracks on the CD are directly from the WoT computer game, including the popular Dahl of a Chant."
1,Bad.,"Wow, this was awful. I'm a very big soundtrack person, and I'm a very big Wheel of Time person. And in my opinion, such a travesty should never have been allowed. Who does this Robert Berry think he is that he can dare to represent Robert Jordan's masterpiece with this crap?"
1,What a butchering!!!,"I don't own the CD, but I'd like to caution people to listen to the sampled BEFORE they go and waste money on junk like this. I have read the enitre series, and WHERE does it include modern trash? I was expecting something you could listen to while reading the book, maybe something along the lines of the LOTR soundtrack. This soundtrack only connects to the books in one way; the first verse of the first sample in which he mumbles ""The wheel of time""."
4,Things Almost Never Change,"I wanted to purchase a copy of this book when I became interested in a completely selfish amature study of pre-Production Code films. After viewing ""The Divorcee,"" I knew I had to get a copy of the book upon which the movie was based. What I didn't expect however, is that for an intallment-authored magazine story, a common form of entertainment for the masses prior to television, written in 1929, very little seems to have changed. Much of the dialogue still occurs in 2003 and you find yourself relying on the prohibition life of New York to keep you in the proper era while reading. Although not a feminist book (it actually petitions against feminism in jibing ways), it does show independant qualities in women entwined with very human emotions. The book is not among the great literature of our time, but does demonstrate an historical perspective that is quite fascinating."
2,Was better the first time,"I really liked this movie when I watched it the first time when it came out, but it is just not that funny, I bought it a month ago, watched and and it will probably go in the bottom drawer. I would rent it not but it."
5,The fued of the century,I've watched this movie at least 30 times and it's just as entertaining as it was the first time I watched it. This recent purchase was for a friend and she loved it too.
2,"Good movie, poor quality","Loved this flick. Lots of laughs, Danny Devito and Richard Dryfus at their best. Many of the sales tactics I first saw in this movie are still around today. Had a friend who sold doomers in New York I used to call Tin Man.Very poor quality dvd. Looks like $5.00 Bootleg. Don't know if it was produced that way or if it's been burned at home. Kept waiting for someone to standup in the movie theather and walk in front of the screen. Could not recommend."
4,One of my favorite comedies.,"This movie is a classic work that has received very little ink. The story line is a classic out of the fast talking salesmanship of the early 1960s. War War II vets as well as others were looking for opportunity to make a buck selling products door-to-door. Remember all the vacuum cleaner salesmen? What ""Tin Men"" captures is the the down side of competition. Fortunately, for the movie, this brings out the best of the two main characters. Both have a lust for shiney Cadillacs, an idea for a good scam, and are under a great deal of stress. When these to rivals collide, literally, the movie takes off. The two aluminum siding salesmen's game of brinkmenship spirals out of control. Great flick!"
2,Forgettable,"Visual and cultural cliches of 1963 are run into the ground. Both Devito and Dreyfuss overact several scenes, which must mean lousy direction. A few more pregnant pauses would give more weight and authenticity. Every character seems to be a sociopath who piles one mistake onto another. ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" had these same types but felt much more real."
3,"No, not the best . . .","I?m a food person, I love pasta, and I often am short of time to do much cooking, so this book seemed like a natural for me: 80-odd pages of recipes designed to be put together in the time it takes to actually boil the pasta. The instructions include detailed instructions, good illustrations, and by-the-way comments on preparation of ingredients. The problem is, you have to maintain a significant stock of ingredients you?re unlikely to use otherwise (or I am, anyway), like capers, pine nuts, prosciutto, heavy cream, and Gorgonzola. Also, many of the ingredients, like asparagus and shrimp, are supposed to be fresh -- so how are you supposed to keep them handy? Finally, while there are some interesting recipes in this collection, some are downright wierd: I mean, fresh figs, cream, and vodka?"
1,BEWARE! You or your children can be burned!!!,"I totally agree with the person who tried to retrieve his poptart. Don't buy this toaster if you plan to toast frozen waffles or french toast sticks. On top of that, keep your children from trying to retrieve anything that has fallen down into this toaster. There is metal on the top around where the slices are placed and it gets very hot! My eight year old son was badly burned by this toaster. It's now in the garbage where it belongs. Don't buy this toaster!"
2,Broken after 1 year,"This toaster worked OK for a year but now it's broken. The lever doesn't catch anymore at the bottom. The only way to toast now is to stand there and hold it down for a few minutes. It lasted about 300 cycles before breaking. Time to buy a new one, but will not be buying this one again."
3,T-Fal 53970 Thick & Thin Two Slice Toaster,Greetings! I like the slim and sleek look and feel to this toaster. I've been pleased with it. The thick & thin slots are what motivated me to make this purchase.
4,"VERY WELL-TOLD, VIVID DETAILS, COMPELLING LIVES....","We were vacationing in England, when I saw this book on the shelf at Foyle's. I picked it up and read the back and we spent a lot of money at Foyle's but I didn't buy DANZIGER'S TRAVELS. However, it kept coming back into my thoughts every time we'd pass a bookstore, so at the airport, before we boarded the plane, I ran like a madwoman to the newstand and purchased a copy. I read it the whole way home on the plane, in the limousine on the ride home, and for three days following our return. I did take time out to unpack, but not much. It is a really interesting travel story, and an interesting telling of how Danziger was affected personally by the trip, but more by the people. Pick it up and see if you can put it down, I'll bet you can't. It's worth the time."
4,A good introduction to Central Asian travel writing,"I first picked up this book ten years ago at a secondhand shop in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, at the end of the Karakoram highway and read it with fascination. Having travelled most of the same route very thoroughly myself, some things in the book come across as a little too fantastic, and others are just wrong . To be generous these could be failings of memory. Yet, these are minor flaws, that haven't stopped me from enjoying the book.I disagree with the complaints on the amazon.uk site about the quality of the prose, keeping in mind it is a personal travel book and not a scholarly examination of the regions he passes through. We get insights into the people he meets but most importantly into the life of Mr Danziger himself. The omissions, the fantasies and ultimately the focus of the book always, like a dream, come back to the narrator and his own experience on his narrow path across the globe.Well worth a read."
3,"Great performances, defective DVD","This is Astor in his later years, a ""must have"" for Piazzolla fans. But the copy I bought here hangs up on a disclaimer screen at the beginning and won't continue. The only way I can view the first segment is to go to #2, then rewind. Frustrating, someone dropped the ball in production. My player is an older Sony, but has usually been very capable, so I think it's an encoding problem. Be aware!"
3,obsolete item,"Only a collector should look for this item. Music lovers should purchase the 2-song ""single"" CD instead, with both ""Suerte"" and ""Whenever Wherever"" on it. Then you can form your own opinion of which chorus you prefer, and how closely the verses are translated!"
5,Duh her....,"I would just like to comment that the songs are VERY similar, besides the choruses themselves.Plus, I would reccomend anything with Shakira's name on it ;)"
1,Les Plus belles fables ne sont pas tres belles,"I ordered and returned 2 copies of this small book from Amazon. In both copies, the black and white printing was extremely faded and the page was not in place when the printing took place. On some pages the print started about 1/4 the way down so the bottom 1/4 of the text did not get printed on the page."
2,ONLY FOR SMALL YARDS,This machine is not powerful. It lacks torque. The self propel belt is flimsy. Mine broke out of the box after two cutting two rows. This machine cannot cut through long grass without slogging down. It is very slow when the self propel is engaged. The screw knobs on the handle piping vibrate loose. This is fine for small yard or occasional mowing. For large yards and weekly mowing this is a failure.
4,pretty good time piece,"durable, but finish wore out in places after 10 months, still never skipped a second from being set."
2,It fell apart :(,I loved the concept of this watch but the magnifying cover fell apart from the watch. Not designed for heavy usage.
2,Darker than it sounds,"This novel reminded me why in other authors' plot lines involving telepathy the lead characters CAN'T read each others minds. It's very useful for spies but awkward much of the rest of the time. Having the twisted psycho-villain in the hero's head during love scenes - ick. Darker than it sounds, with not just telepathy but telepathic compulsion. Secondary characters weren't very interesting. Delivered on some suspense and heat, though."
5,Trekker's delight,"I purchased these Black Diamonds to replace a set of Leki twist lock, anti shock poles. I found those to be difficult to adjust with gloves and the anti shock function would click on or off while the poles were being used.I use these for hiking, backpacking & climbing the rugged trails of NY's Adirondack Mountains. The thumb lock design is easy to use and does not slip even with maximum force placed upon it. They are light weight and the dual position grips are very comfortable. They collapse and store easily even in a daypack! I added a set of rubber tips which make the poles feel secure and quiet when placed on rock surfaces.These Black Diamonds surely enhance my hiking pleasure and I do not miss the anti shock feature at all. If you are looking for light weight, easy to use trekking poles, these are definitely worth checking out."
4,"Good ""How to"" book","This , like all the Foster books, is simple illustration for anyone beginning to draw, and especially if one is not all that familiar with horses. A good book to familiarize one prior to actually going into the field to draw from live animals."
4,Drawing Horses,This guidebook is full of great drawings. I admire the artists' skills. I hope I can absorb some of their instruction.
3,Found it lacking,"I am a beginner at drawing and I found this book a little to complecated to understand. The pictures were not that detailed, and the text was lacking also. They need to make it more step-by-step in both the wording and the drawings."
4,Great sf action book,"I couldn't put the book down once I started it. If you like David Feintuch's Midshipman's Hope, you will love this one. A great read, can't wait for his next one!"
4,A Must Read,"This book deals with the life of one Scott St. Andrew duringhis training at the Elite South Point Military Academy and thestart of hostilities between The Alliances and the Colony worlds.It has great character development and you really feel for thecharacters and thier own weaknesses; and most of the characters are killed off during the book. This brings the effects of combat on the individual soldier to life. This book and itssequel, which will come out in the spring next year will grab youand not let you go."
2,Disappointing given thought put into background,"I have to agree with the second reviewer, that given the effort put into creating background, this came out as a rather tired juvenile novel. The science is dubious, the politics banal and there isn't any sense of tension. Also, isn't Peter Telep (a five star review) the author writing under a pseudonym. Fairly cheesey self-promotion, if so,"
2,Bad Book,"I did not like this book. It did not have as much ""military"" sci-fi as other books I have read. The ending was very bad, sort of like a ""Starship Troopers"" a want to be ending. Only thing, RAH did not write to make sequals. It seeems most military sci-fi authors do that now. Why not just write a good MILITARY sci-fi story, then a different military sci-fi story, and so on, and so on? At least say it on the cover ""Part I of II or III,"" and let the reader decide if he want to commit to 2 or 3 lousy book. The ""skin"" reminded me of the body shield in the David Lynch movie ""Dune."" Maybe I did not get it, though. Do not waste your time, unfortunately, I bought the sequel before I read the original hoping to be impressed. Now I'm stuck with both books until I can find a used book store that gives me less than half price credit for in store purchase for 2 brand new books that stunk."
3,Adequate,"Nothing too bad but not anything that I would ever buy in hardback. The main character just isn't someone I really sympathize with; on the other hand some of the situations and supporting characters were interesting. I just kept feeling like there was potential for this to turn into a really good book but that potential always seemed like it was a chapter and a plot twist away. In the end I still had the same feeling - perhaps the next book will turn this into something really good. Of course, I guess that's the way a series writer might want me to feel so that I buy the next book and the next book and . . . ;)The buddy teaming of the main character and his nemesis from school has a lot of potential. I'll buy the next book to see if there is actual development into something really good but I'll reserve judgement on purchases after that."
4,Some Comments,"For me, this was a non-stop read. This book was fast paced and really got me into the story. Written in first person, I think it has a lot of potential for character empathy and being a SF fan myself, everything else was bonus. I can't wait to find out how the plot and characters develop in the sequel."
1,GBA Shark Tales,"An absolutely horrid game. Repetetive, pointless, with no real skills needed -- random luck seems to be all that is required. Music becomes maddening after 3 minutes. Avoid this at all costs. Shame on you, Activision."
1,to easy,"got it for [...] clearance. went home, played it, beat it in 30 minuits. waste of time and money"
2,Bad Movie and a Bad Game,"When I saw the movie, I thought it was very bad so I almost instantly knew that this was going to be a bad game. So instead of buying it I rented it! I thought it was very boring.DON'T BUY IT RENT THIS GAME!!"
2,What the!!!!!,What the heat is oscar doing on the game it sucks on game boy advance.I got this toy for chrismas and the only thing oscar was doing is dangceing .A scark was about to eathim but all he keep doing was go on whith self so I just let him die.-Love jasmine-Arizona RULES1111111111
2,Reviewer revealed,Listen I've been writing a lot of the Shark Tale GBA game reviews on Amazon and don't like the game at all. Like oh my gosh it's like so bad I the movie. See who I am?
4,"Nice product, but could be a little more flexible","I have a sort of spatula addiction. I own far too many spatulas and always buy more looking for the ""perfect spatula"". This one is a solidly good spatula.I like that it is wide enough to turn any food that I cook. It is excellent with delicate food like fish, crab cakes or risotto cakes. The width of this spatula would make it difficult to use in a tiny pan. I haven't had any problem with pan size, because I use mostly 10 inch pans and wider.The bottom inch of the spatula is flexible, and after that it is rigid. This spatula is a little thicker than I would like it to be. But, if it were thinner it might be too flexible. I would like this spatula to be just a little more flexible.This spatula has been used most days in my kitchen for the last 6 months and so far is showing not signs of wear. It is holding up better than most of the other nylon spatulas that I have purchased in the past.Overall this is good spatula that I would recommend."
3,"Really big, really wide, not always what you need","The spatula is really wide. We discovered that it's not always the ideal shape and size for average size pans. I love the look and feel but in actual practice, it's not as useful as the old fashioned one in the drawer."
2,It's too thin on its' leading edge and warps,"I love my other silcone spatula's by Mario but this one is not what I expected. The edge warps, and it is very difficult to get it under a pancake for example and turn it over. It literally was sticking and tearing the pancake and I was using a non stick griddle. I think perhaps it needed to be a little less long so there would be more support for the food item. Not sure what the warping problem is cause I have only used it once...to try and turn the pancake and washed by hand. I tried putting a weight on the leading edge and leaving it weighed down several days but when I checked to see if that fixed it...it was still warped."
3,Great music track helps this silent L & H comedy,"This is among the best of the recent restorations of Laurel & Hardy's silent comedies. The 1928 film has a new synchronized soundtrack, edited from various vintage-1929 musical scores. The music is as funny as the comedy, as henpecked husbands Laurel & Hardy sneak off for a disastrous ""night out."" The picture quality is very clear and sharp."
3,Depends on what slant of information you're looking for,"This set was developed & produced by the US Dept of Ag to be shown as movie News Reels. In that context, the staged sequences & information dispensed are the government's presentation of this horrible era. From a historical propaganda perspective ... it could be interesting. As an actual resource for the agony of this time period ... it is lacking"
4,"Houdini ""The Man Who Walked Through Walls""",I chose to read abouth this book because the book gives you the details that you need do you can think that you are actually in the book.I also think that the book gives you the full life story of how and why Houdini got into the Magic Business. The book also asks you how you think the book should have been wrote and what things you would change and why you would change them.This book gives you the Information on how Houdini lived his life and who he wanted to live his life with. On the other hand this book is a really good thing to read because they explain it so clearly and they should make a sequel to this book because I think that the readers would take the interest into reading this.
5,Tendre Poison,I LOVE this scent and am so disappointed it's no longer available in stores. Was very grateful to find it here. Great service and quick shipping...will definitely be back when I run oput again!
1,"Ooooh, GROSS!","I was expecting to like this product, or at least be able to tolerate it. This product, however, is really GROSS! The first bite leaves you with a manufactured spicy taste that is not at all natural. I actually had to spit it out. I don't even think anyone in my family will eat this...what a waste of money."
1,Gross taste and texture,"Nutrition wise, this seemed like a good pick. Plus I like jerky and love BBQ. However, I can't find the BBQ and the jerky is gritty and reminds me strongly of dirt. While ""tender,"" which seemed to be a selling point since no one in my house likes the big pieces of really tough jerky, their tenderization left a gritty product lacking in taste, texture, and appeal. I don't know what I'm going to do with the other 11 bags, since one bag shared was enough in everyone to declare this jerky disgusting."
1,I have two words for you:,"In. Edible.I didn't mind the texture, but the flavor was just... well, it was unspeakable.Oh, and you can't return it once the package is opened."
1,"No Carbs, but also not tasty",Found this jerky to be less than what I'd hoped for in the taste department.
1,Sorry I bought it.,Eating this jerky makes me think I'm eating sawdust. Only maybe sawdust has more flavor. Yuck.
4,We liked it!,"It's not the best jerky I've eaten, but it's the best low carb (0), low sodium jerky that I've every eaten! It comes in convenient size packs that a perfect snack size which prevents me from overeating. I'll definitely buy again!"
5,Good jerky,"So far I have only tried the pepper variety, but it was very good. As others have said it is pretty soft and more crumbly than other jerkies, but I like it that way.Will definitely be buying more in the future."
4,I'm a fan,"The texture isn't your average jerky, but I enjoy this as a nice high-protein, low-calorie snack. I didn't pay much attention to the ingredients, unfortunately."
3,"Good taste, small pieces","While this jerky has good flavor, the size of the pieces are rather small. Since I bought them for my two year old to snack on, the bite sized pieces pose a slight choking hazzard in my mind, so the unused bags will sit in my cupboard till I can pass them on to some adult that likes jerky. It's too bad because he really likes to gnaw on the stuff, and this additive free jerky would have been a nice snack for him."
2,Fair L&H short feature,"Standard effort from the boys during their silent era. Made during the time the boys were just beginning to make sound films, this particular effort is somewhat sub-par. Stan dresses in drag to pose as Oliver's wife so he won't miss out inheriting his uncle's fortune. The night club scene has some laughs, but how often can you chuckle at tripping waiters into desserts and having their faces covered in whipped cream? A film for fans only."
5,This book is a must read for any Reformation Protestant.,This is the best book that I have ever read. Every Christian must read it. You will be encouraged by the brave Christians who suffered under pagan and Papal Rome.
2,Nice read but beware this is not a word for word reprint of the original work,"John Foxe's Book of Martyrs is indeed a classic of Christian literature. John Foxe was born in 1517 and died in 1587. John Foxe documented the persecutions of Christians from the foundation of the church through his time. Outside of the Bible itself, this is one of the few books every Christian should read. From time to time the book has been updated to cover generations John would not live to see. While this book is a worthy read - be aware that this is not a faithful word for word reprint of the original works but as the cover says a rewrite. If you are interested in a rendition which remains more faithful to the the original author's words, look for a reprinted edition edited by (co-author) William Forbush."
1,Incomplete edition,"Readers of John Foxe's book of martyres should realize that the most complete edition of this work was published in the 1800s and comprised 8 volumes. A bound photocopy of that edition is available from Still Waters Revival Books in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. They have a web site. The present edition is a small sampling of the real Foxe."
2,New Foxe's Book of Martyrs,"I was disappointed in the ""New"" Foxe's Book of Martrys. I read an older version in my teens. This one has been heavily edited, especially the early church martrydom's. If you're looking for more recent historical information this may be a good book but for early church information go to another edition."
3,Not what is advertised,I purchased this thinking it was the most recent edition. It is not. The content of the book is good but the kindle addition is nothing special. It is very basic. I would recommend the book but the kindle addition is lacking...but for $1 I guess it's worth having it on your kindle.
4,Foxe's Book of Martyrs,"I have heard many ministers referring to this book lately. It is quite informative and a help in my studies. The S&H cost more than the book, but it was worth every penny."
3,Good but toned down,"Although any metal nowadays is good to have, I was somewhat dissapointed with this. While the show was good, the members of the band are starting to show their age. The guitar solos were short and not with as much energy. If you compare this concert to Unleashed in the East you will see the difference."
5,Awesome!,"I saw Priest this year in San Antonio, Texas and they kicked it! The DVD made me think that I was back at the concert. Awesome sound and camera work is what you will find on this DVD. JP rocks on this DVD!"
5,Nothing Better Than This!!!,The production is brilliant. Sound and video quality is unreal. Buy it! You won't be disapointed!
4,Owens does good on Halfords tunes,"Its amazing how well Owens replaces Halford on these songs. This is definitely a must buy DVD. I'm not even a die hard Judas priest fan (mainly the pain killer and jugginator albums) and I liked this. Picture is good, sounds is good. Only complaint, and its not really focused at the DVD as much as the future of this bad: Owens was a great replacement for Halford, don't get me wrong, I guess they found him in a priest cover band. My problem is it sounds like he ran out of ideas fast. Jugginator album was awesome, orginal, sounded like priest but even had a touch of alternative in it. If anyone has heard owen's newest album with priest though, I was way unimpressed. He sounds burnt out, the songs aren't catchy, sound the same, and I haven't listened to that album again. It sounds like he is fizzling out fast, where, on the other hand, halford's new album is awesome!"
5,Excellant source of Catholic theology.,I lead a Bible study for 5 years using The Navarre Commentaries.They are a safe source for the truth about what the Bible means. The commentary uses extensive quotes from the Early Church Fathers and The Catechism of The Catholic Church. The commentary supplies both the Latin and English text.
3,Streamlined but has some querks,This T-fal blender is very pretty to look at but it has a few flaws. But let's start on the positive points first:1. Light weight machine with wonderful aerodynamic shape.2. Cord storage underneath.3. Easy to clean pop out bottom blade.4. Makes very nice smoothies - when you use the pulse control to get things started.5. Instructions come in several languages.Negatives or Querks in the design:1. Child proof and rather difficult when you have to make certain the top is on correctly otherwise the blender will not work.2. Top release also is a little annoying.3. Very tall machine that I can't fit into my cabinets in one piece.
3,Not as convenient as other but STRONG!,"It looks better than it is ergonomic. However, it's really strong and the range of speed is great. My wife likes it now."
1,Leaks every time,I hate this blender. Its on its way back to the store. I've never gotton it to stop leaking. It is very hard to get the top on and off of the base. The base is very lightweight and the top heavy. When it is full of liquid it is very easy to tip over. Junk.
2,Motorcraft Rotors,Purchased two rotors that were labeled as motorcraft assuming they would have been made in the USA but they were made in China. One off them installed with no problems but the other one was made wrong and it rubbed on part of the spindle casting.
3,"Trap *can* work, but gets messy and may kill non-problem animals.","A feature of this trap is ""never have to touch a dead mouse!"" I find that pretty pathetic, because if you can't go through the trouble of putting on a pair of gloves then... I won't go into that. Yes this trap catches mice, but it also catches and kills chipmunks and other rodents that do not create problems for humans. The trap uses a conventional spring set arm that crushes the animal quickly and is therefore more humane than other traps. The problem with this mechanism is that it can crush the animal into a mess. Maybe some people would get a kick out of that, but I don't. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as ""starting fluid"" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."
1,"Mice suffer long time after trapped, does not die","Yesterday afternoon I received the trap and set it in a course that I've seen mice hiding in the midnight.Today at 3:30am I was working at my dining room, and heard a snap... it catched the unwanted visitor.Unfortunatelly, it did not die right away. Right now it's 4am, and the mice is still fighting with the trap, making noises.... which made me feel very uncomfortable and sad. I'm now considering a humane trap.4:10 Mice strugging with even bigger effort... I'm so sad that this trap is making it suffer so much.8:24am I woke up and the mouse is still alive...12.25am next day... Mouse still alive. All my kids saw the mouse struggling and even turned its head over... it was really a horrible experience."
1,"The two I ordered snapped twice, but nothing inside..","Go figure. But if you're interested, look in my reviews for the traps that worked best for me."
2,Ewwwwwwww!!! Disgusting & Disturbing,"WARNING... READ AT YOUR ICK! DISCRETIONSo, we used two of these and while the mice were whomped alright, the tails. back feet and in one of the traps a little of the raunchy butt was sticking out the end. It's gonna take me years to recover from the sight. *gag*"
1,save your money,"I have tried about every trap available today and none works as good as the old style hinge trap, I have tried tomcat, live traps, both dcon and tomcat circular traps, literally everything available in my small town. I was hoping this trap would at least be effective once, it just went off and upon inspection the peanut butter in the cup was completely licked clean, no evidence of the mouse. With the sorry traps on the market today you would be better off trying to make your own or buying a cat. None are sensitive enough to release the trigger for a mouse, I think most nowadays are made for rats."
5,Killed our mouse!,"Killed the mouse that had been running around our apartment by using this trap and peanut butter! We set up three around the apartment and had trapped it within a month (the mouse only came once and awhile so this was quick in my opinion). The trap is easy to clean up and set. Only thing is that the ""pull back"" to set feature can be hard to load and take a couple minutes. However, that is definitely not a reason to not purchase the product. I really love this!"
4,keeps the dog's nose from getting snapped,"I'm very happy with these covered traps. Others I've tried haven't worked nearly as well. I don't like to kill anything but had to resort to kill traps in the house. The mouse goes in head first and is killed quickly, rather than other traps that sometimes snap just a leg or tail, which is not ideal and prolongs suffering--and then you may have a live, injured mouse to deal with.These are covered so neither myself nor my dog are accidentally snapped. They've worked well for over a year and, having not seen any more mice, I've passed them on to a relative to use. The snap spring has stayed strong. Sometimes they are very difficult to get to set. It sometimes takes many tries to set them but so far, they've always eventually each set.You can easily dispose of the mouse without touching it. I'm happy with them."
1,mice never touched a,Mice would totallyignore theswes packages !I tried spicing them up a little with peanut butter and Kitchen grease to make them more appealing ! They never touched theses small packages of ! D-Con >> In the past I did find success with the loose D-Con in the trays 1
3,"When they work, they are fantastic","I bought 3 traps. 1 of the 3 is flawless, the other two didn't seem to spring into action. I found the food gone, but the spring still set. Luckily, they got greedy and went to the trap that worked. That trap has been a workhorse. I marked it with a pen mark, rotated the traps and the mice only get caught in that trap. So buy a few.The design is fantastic - it is safe for my small dog - he can't get his paw or snout close enough to hurt himself. Also, the trap being enclosed is much neater, cleaner and quieter than an open trap."
5,This trap rocks,"Within 3 hours of placing the trap in the frequently visited site the varmint was sent to his permanent resting place wherever that might be. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you"
5,It works but,"I didn't mean to kill the mice. I just want a trap to catch mouse live. I think I missed the ""kill"" part in description. But it works just caught in minutes of laying trap."
2,Why so many stars?,"First of all, I bought two of these and 6 of the 'Better Mouse Trap's, BOTH SUCKED. The better mouse trap caught nothing. But not only did the d-CONs not catch anything, as soon as I first tried to set the trap, the darn set wouldn't stay down. AND YES I DID IT SLOWLY, S-L-O-W-L-Y. I had to use a knife to wiggle with it to set it. For the first week, nothing. Then all of a sudden I heard a snap and I got excited. I dug out the trap from under the kitchen cabinets, and to my disappointment, I found that the snap was not due to a mouse capture, but rather some plastic part of the trap broke, and now, won't set at all, the plastic enclosure id snapped off when I was trying to open it to clean off the peanut butter. I'm asking for an exchange for new ones since the two I got broke, I'm given this crap a second chance. Why? I dont know, I guess its because I really want to catch these damn mice, and no other trap has such high ratings. Fark."
2,D-Con 00027 Ultra Set Covered Snap Mouse Trap,"The trap is nice because you do not have to view a dead mouse, only the tail sticks out. At first I loved the traps, but I have since had lots of problems re setting them, as they are reusable. It does not stay set and a few of them cannot be set anymore."
2,Cheap plastic mechanism,"Bought 3. Caught 2. One was broken before use. You can't reuse. Too fragile. Looks good, but plastic doesn't work here. I'll stick with the old school trap. I can't believe these reviews. Only good point, easier to dispose of the mouse."
4,Great Results!,"I bought this product after I found some mice in our house and it works wonderfully. On the very first day, I set up 3 traps in the area where I found traces and caught 3! I used rice as bait which works great and is less messy than peanut butter.There are some shortcomings about this products though:1. The trap is covered which means it's hard to reach the bait cup. I have to use a measuring spoon to put the bait in there.2. This product is made of plastic so sometimes it's not that reusable. I bought 5 of them and had trouble setting 1 (it wouldn't lock) and had trouble resetting 2 after first use."
1,Flimsy,"It does get points for ease of use, *if* you can get it to work. I bought 4 of these. One of them wouldn't set from the beginning; it seemed to be missing a crucial piece that keeps the lever down. Another one set, but then snapped back 5 minutes later without anything going into it as far as I could tell; then I couldn't set it again. The third trap did catch a mouse, but somehow the mouse got caught in the wrong direction (head facing outward) and got trapped but not killed! Perhaps this was just a very skilled mouse. The fourth trap is still sitting on my counter waiting for a mouse..."
3,the only trap I use,"I just can't stand seeing dead mice; poison and glue traps are too cruel. Though not terribly sturdy, these traps work 10x better than the round cover traps. I have found if you have trouble snaping in place, remove some of the bait. For whatever reason it works. I don't reuse them though, I just don't know how clean that really is."
1,Defective Design,"Purchased two of these products and set both. One caught a mouse the first night. Disposed of the mouse and attempted to reset the trap. Wouldn't reset. Same thing happened with the other trap. Purchased two more. Took them out of the box, neither would set. Have returned all four."
1,"Very poor quality, broke the first time I tried to set it","I bought this product based on previous good reviews but sadly the one I received broke the first time I tried to set it. Overall it is made from very low quality plastic and the setting mechanism relies on a small plastic catch to hold the spring back. I guess on the one I got this was not cast properly and sheared off. Luckily I also boughtVictor M038 Easy Set Mouse Trap, 4-Packwhich I have no problems with, now to see if I actually catch some mice!"
4,Very easy to set up and empty,"Im not really sqeamish when it comes to mice, but I dont like setting up the old style mousetraps. Ive snapped my own fingers enough times not to want to go that route again. This product, as so many other reviewers have noted, really is easy to use. Most of the mice that were living here are now dead and gone, or moved out to find easier stomping grounds. This this will get them every time, they just cant resist. I find that peanut butter works best. Im not able to trap mice to release them far away, so this is much easier on the mice than glue traps, which are horrible in my opinion"
1,Do not buy !,"I started using these a few years ago. The original ones lasted a few seasons but eventually I could not reset them. I decided to get new ones. I tested all three at the store before buying them. They worked fine.After setting them up at home one caught mice, one couldn't be reset after the mouse ate all the peanut butter and escaped,the third one couldn't be tripped after being sent twice.This used to be a good product but now they are just made in China junk.Luckily I only had them for a week and saved the receipt so back to the store they go."
2,"It so, totally, did not work.","I bought this product because I had a mouse in the house. Three days later, after baiting and setting this trap I STILL had a mouse in my house. I tried different bait but the mouse never fell for it.I ended up buying a snap-trap. UGH! I hate those things but at least they WORK!"
2,faulty,I've bought two of these. The first lasted 3 or 4 times before the lever would no longer set. I was disappointed but thought it was good enough value to buy a second one. The second one I purchased didn't even work once - I could not get the lever to set.
1,Build a better mousetrap,"The Ultra-set trap was simply defective. Once set, it would not release. The trigger pad is stopped at the floor of the trap and does not release. An email to the manufacturer resulted in 2 coupons totaling far less than the price of the trap. Both product and customer service were unsatisfactory. (As a Mechanical Engineer I find this really annoying.)"
2,"Some work, some don't.","I've bought a number of these traps, I'd say 25 over the past couple years. It seems that about 1/4 or 1/5 are defective- the clasp simply won't catch when you try to set them. You may find yourself extremely frustrated as you attempt to delicately handle the lever, time after time, to no avail. I realize there's a bit of an art to setting even functional ones, but I've set enough to know when they simply don't work.If you manage to get the trap set (recommend peanut butter), it will get the job done. The cover is the main reason I've bought so many.I have mixed feelings about the product, feel it's deserving of somewhere between 2 and 3 stars, but I've rounded down b/c the price strikes me as a bit high (I suppose it's hard not to feel that way with a defective worthless trap!) In fairness, I haven't done much market research on traps, so don't really know how their price compares."
1,no good,"didn't kill a one, buy the electoronic unit. this thing has a tiny hole and the mice new it was a trap."
2,One GREAT; One a DUD,"I bought two traps. One has worked very well and I am very pleased; the other one broke on the second use. The plastic pin that holds the spring in the ""set"" position broke and I had no alternative but to throw the entire trap away. I was very disappointed because I bought the product after reading the rave reviews on-line. The ""plastic entry door"" is cute, but I leave it open, the better to encourage the mouse toward the bait. This morning's catch was needlessly cruel--for the mouse. For some reason the spring did not catch him/her on the back/neck, but rather by the feet/tail. The poor creature had gnawed through the plastic covering in a vain attempt to get free and ultimately died from the d-Con poison that I had used for bait."
3,One mouse wonder,This trap seems to work but it's very hard to clean and the trip mechanism is difficult to set at times.
1,Very disappointed,"Because of all the good remarks about this product, I bought two recently. When I received them I put in the bait as instructed and within one day the traps were triggered 4 times but just didn't catch the mouse! Once I actually saw the mouse followed the bait trail to the trap but still it was not caught. Then I tried a few more times next day. The bait were taken, the traps were triggered and they were dragged to some nearby places but the mouse still got away ..."
4,They work but...,"I purchased four of these three weeks ago after seeing a very small mouse. After about 2 1/2 weeks I hadn't caught any mouse and was going to take them up and decided against it. I checked them to see if the peanut butter was still there and it was. A couple of days later I saw the mouse again. I was told to use COCOA. When we went to replace the peanut butter with cocoa, the peanut butter had been eaten clean out of one of the traps. My only explanation for this was either the mouse was too small to set the trap off or that particular trap is defective.After putting cocoa in the traps, there was a mouse in it this morning. I couldn't bring myself to reuse the trap but I may quickly get over that depending how often they are caught.I paid $4.50 for them at Target so the price here is excellent."
5,Best one I've used,there are many traps like this with the same features that kill the mouse the same way. What I like about this one is that the mouse is housed so its safer and no contact with mouse when getting rid of it. make sure to put against wall where mice run around not in center of room.
2,Difficult to set! Cheap and a waste of money!,"The idea of these traps are solid, but they are impossible to set up. The trigger never latches on so you can spend 10 minutes just trying to set it. You place it down and it goes off! Bought two and I threw them out because they're:1) Cheaply made2) Ineffective since you can't set the traps3) Not worth the hassle.I bought these because of the reviews and what a mistake!"
2,Often defective,I have had limited success with this trap. I caught a few mice but also often found the bait gone. In addition the trap is poorly made. I had to return two defective traps that could not be set due to a faulty trigger.
5,Caught 5 mice so far since March. (edit: 4 more this spring),"I bought one of these and it's caught 5 mice since March. Every once in a while, my cat (or the wife and I) hear a scurrying in the drop ceiling in our finished basement. I put this up onto one of the tiles with some PB and within a few days I check to see if the metal lock mechanism has moved and pull down the trap and take the mouse out to the woods.I would recommend this for anyone who has a small rodent problem.2011 Update:Heard some mice in the drop ceiling again the other day. Caught 4 within 2 days. I accidentally broke the plastic ""hinge"" but just used duct tape to fix it. still works fine, but i just bought a 2nd one to replace the old one."
4,well designed,"I bought this trap to teach a few sassy little mice a lesson that they'd never forget. One down, possibly a few more to go. I can't tell for sure how many. Little furballs all look alike to me.Big positive... designed in a way where my nosey little dog can't get his face stuck in it!"
3,d-Con Ultra SEt Coverned Mouse Trap,"Worked great, but one of the traps would not engage (will send it back.) They also say you can use them over & over, but I was not able to set the trap again - just like the one that did not engage. Not worth the high cost if you cannot use it again - like they said in the info."
1,Broke on first use,A small piece of plastic on the inside broke on the first time the trap caught a mouse. It couldn't be used again.
2,Mine didn't work.,"The hook that holds the metal bar in place doesn't work on mine. I know that if I didn't have a defective trap, it would have probably worked... but who knows with my mouse. It's managed to set off but avoid 1 Snap-E trap and 3 ordinary d-Con wooden traps. I was hoping this would do the trick, as I've had to move the food in my cupboards and pantry twice and tape up any and all openings, no matter how small and it seems to be working. I guess I'll have to manage life with a mouse in my kitchen. I don't want to use poison because the mouse hides in places I can't get to and I don't want it's dead body stinking up my house."
4,The best trap I've ever used,"I have a mouse problem in my current apartment, and these traps have been a life saver. They are so easy to set, and I don't have to worry about my fingers getting snapped when I set them. You don't have to see the mouse to know they've been caught (at most, I can see the tail of the mouse sticking out of the trap), and they're easy to reuse.The only quibble I have is that you have to bait the traps in a certain way if they are to be most effective. I use peanut butter for my traps, and I noticed that, if you place the bait a certain way on the trigger, the mice can get the peanut butter without getting caught. That's the only complain I have, however. Definately worth the price."
4,Mouse caught in 2 hours,"I purchased one of these traps not knowing if it would work. I had bought a different concealed trap from DCON that never caught a mouse. I put this one out in the kitchen in the early afternoon...within 2 hrs I had the snap from the other room and it caught its first mouse! I was very impressed. I only used a very tiny amount of peanut butter. One downside was that the long tail of the mouse stuck out from trap, avoiding 100% concealment, but didn't have to see the body. I recommend setting some of these up if you have mice problems."
4,Good but not perfect,"These traps are excellent for preventing exposure (and sight) of captured rodents. The only drawback is that the trip mechanism is inconsistent - I have had several traps where the mouse has ""beaten"" me by getting the bait without ever setting off the trap. The piece of plastic that holds the bar in place is too big, and even pressing on it with a stick won't release the trap. I've fixed these by myself by modifying the trap a little, but it seems a little more quality control would go a long way. Otherwise a much better way of catching mice than a typical trap or glue."
2,So-so product.....,"OK, I purchased these after reading some reviews, and for the fact that it sort of hides the dead mouse. Caught a mouse on night #2, which was great. There is one problem though... due to the flimsy plastic catch on this trap, resetting this thing after getting rid of the dead mouse is a major hassle. It just won't stay in the ""set"" position, keeps snapping down. Takes a good 5-10 minutes at least to set it... I think there are better choices out there, and in fact I ordered another brand hoping to have better luck."
1,Broke After 1 Week,It is made of very low grade plastic. It broke after only one week of use. Do not buy this product.
1,These are the worst traps I have ever used.,"I order twelve of these traps. Five were broken; they would not set, as many others have noted in their reviews.This morning I went downstairs and there was a poor mouse, still alive, in the trap. It was horrible. The poor thing had chewed away at the plastic, trying to get out. I picked the trap up and he got about half of his body out of the trap. It must have somehow snagged the poor guy's tail and foot. I was horrified and screamed so loudly I woke up one of my choldren. I hate the mess they make in my house but I would never want to cause this sort of suffering to any living thing. I brought it outside and managed to release it. It may well be back in my house but I hope not for the poor thing's sake.I threw the remaining traps away. I would NEVER use one of these again."
4,d-con 00027 ultra set covered mouse trap--needs better quality control,"The d-con 00027 covered mousetrap would be great if so many of them were not defective. They do catch the mice and make it easy to dispose of (just shake the dead mouse out into a waste container) and sometimes the trap is reusable--if you get a good one. Too often, they don't work (will not engage)even when brand new and even more often when they have been used. They cost too much not to be reusable. It is a nuisance to have to send back a defective trap. How about some quality control and checking them before they are sold."
1,Broken out of the box.,"The trap was defective from the manufacture. This has nothing to do with Amazon, just the trap would not latch. Therefor making it useless. Sending it back for a refund."
5,Effective Way to Rid Your Home of Rodents,"Bought this product at the grocery store just yesterday & set it with peanut butter, as instructed. Checked the trap this morning & YES! there was a mouse efficiently eliminated by this trap. Easy to ""unload"" & there was still some bait left over so I set it again today. The only thing, Amazon, is that the grocery store's price was $3.99 regular price. I'm really surprised Amazon's price is over $5.00 at the time of this review.This trap is far better than the regular spring traps, which are tricky to set & dangerous if kids or pets are around."
1,Build a better mouse trap,"Put peanut butter on the hole inside as directed. Came to check the next morning and the peanut butter was gone, trap empty and still set."
2,Great ... at first. Then - not at all.,Trap caught a few mice. Now they are grabbing the bait and not triggering the trap. The trap just doesn't hold up well over time. Takes several tries to set the trap. Once set - it doesn't want to trigger. Moving on to something else.
2,POS,"This trap worked well for 1 mouse. After that it would not stay set. You have to tilt it, turn it upside down, move it all around to find a sweet spot to where the latch would catch and allow it to stay set. Just get the old fashioned traps."
5,Amazing!,"Wow! I was skeptical of these reviews since all were saying how quickly they caught the mice. We first saw a mouse in our garage several weeks ago and I insisted on no kill humane traps (there are 6 in my garage). Haven't caught a single mouse in all these weeks, and actually thought maybe they weren't there anymore since there wasn't any evidence of damage. Yesterday, I spotted the mouse RUNNING OUT OF the humane no kill trap after his morning peanut butter meal and my husband went out and bought these. Well, not only were every one of the other traps licked clean of peanut butter, this morning we woke up and found the d-con trap did the job, less than 24 hours later!! I would highly recommend this trap, since the no kill traps don't do the job!"
5,Fantastic,"This book should be given to all teenage boys around 13and up,I have given it to all my grandsons,what a Great insight into what real love is. Great Reading !"
5,"Old, but not irrelevant","Although written or compiled in the 1950s, the very essence of this book is true human communication to understand and to live and love in a more complete way. Mr Trobisch's letters with a true seeker are compelling and frank. We use this book with singles as a way to create conversation about love and the sex act.I am so glad it is in reprint."
5,This is truth-telling about true love.,"I read this book 32 years ago at age 19. Its powerful clear message gripped my heart then and has remained a benchmark of true love for my relationship with my wife and our children as they one by one work through the process of choosing a mate. After 28 years of marriage, I find Walter's message in ""I Loved A Girl"" rich and helpful."
1,Old Camera?,"I bought this camera in 1999 - I thought it had been superceded by newer models but it looks like they are still selling it. You may want to check out the Canon site for details.Newer models have the ability to take hi quality still pictures as well, some with ""hard"" (memory stick etc.) memory so that you don't have to wait five seconds for the image to record to tape as you do with the Elura.You may also want to consider a camera with digital output other than Firewire - perhaps one with a USB connection and editing software included.The camera does take great pictures; autofocus, light sensitivity etc. are good.But I did have some possible quality issues: the lithium batteries gave out after about 1 1/2 years and it required a ... repair around the same time. I can't say the camera was subjected to hard use and my experience is similar to others who bought Canon DV cameras when they first came out.Perhaps they've worked out the kinks by now ."
5,A stunning collection of this master's greatest pictures...,"Where do I begin? This book is so full - full of talent and inspiration, full of insights and facts, but most importantly it is full of beautiful, visually intoxicating photographs. Gee, can you tell I liked it? From beginning to end it remains consitently captivating, whether the subject is lanscapes, shadows, bottoms (which he professes his affection for more than once), or fashion, his pictures take you with him through his decades of experience from budding young photographer to a true master. The price for this huge volume of work is so incredibly low that I highly recommend buying it, it's more than worth it."
4,"Amazing photgraphs, except at the end of book","When I bought this book, I though that is another good monography of some french photographer, but nothing special. After 5-10 pages I realised, that this book is no ordinary, but express everything becouse I prefered photography itself: The timeless moments, game between light and dark in soft impressive shadows, and the most important: extreme simplicity of composition, wich is made Jeanloup a master. I was dissapointed only at the end of book, when the autor include some average photos, which takes a delicate shadow. But probably is difficult to select almoust 300 photos and stayed impartial."
2,Not Happy,"This is an Uncomfortable shoe. The heel is much higher than discribed, and it is much too tight. It was on sale, so returning it was not an option. So, I have a pair of shoes that will never be worn."
3,This is an abriged edition,"George Sturt's original work provided an unparalleled glimpse into the work, lives, and social environment of craftsmen at the end of the transition from the English craft to the modern industrial economy. The edition offered here is an abridged version of the original; retaining most of the how-to elements, but excluding the insights into the lives and characters of the craftsmen working in the Wheelwright's Shop. If all that interests you are how wagon wheels where constructed, the abridged version will suffice. If you want to understand the revolutionary transition from the craft tradition to the era of unskilled industrial mass production, then continue searching for Sturt's complete text."
1,Important: The Kindle edition is highly abridged,"Although there is nothing in the write-up to indicate this, the Kindle edition of ""The Wheelwright's Shop"" is actual a ""Selections from..."". Glad I decided to try a ""sample"" first..."
4,"""Testify"" was a Good Song Funked Up","""I Just Want To Testify"" was originally a straight R&B cut by Parliament in the late '60s before they developed into the funked up Parliament that changed the music scene in the 70's and 80's. ""Up for the Down Stroke"" was the first song that made me notice Parliament after the original ""Testify"". This is the album that got me hooked on Parliament/Funkadelic back in the day."
4,BEST OF PARLIAMENT,"This is a tight introduction to one of the greatest funk bands in music history. This first album by PARLIAMENT, is probably their most underated. The stand-out tracks are the title track, ""The Goose"", ""I Can Move You If you Let Me"", ""All Your Goodies Are Gone"" and ""Whatever Makes My Baby Feel Good"". If you are collecting Parliament's old works, definitely pick this one up!El-715"
4,magnetismofintelligence,"This is soulful funk from PARLIMENT, the brain child of Mr George Clinton. On UP FOR THE DOWN STROKE the band, including one of the most influential bass players of all time, Mr William (Bootsy) Collins, is just getting started. The title cut is an anthem. WMBFG and POAB are slow and soulful. TESTIFY and GOOSE have the foundations of super, super heavy funk. If you are interested in funkadelia from the seventies or in music with a groove, this CD will interest you."
1,Unpleasantly Surprized,"The first shock I got when I opened the package was that the entire base of the saw is a very thin plastic, including the mounting structure. I have looked at a lot of table saws (other brands) in stores and they usually have very sturdy cast iron or aluminum bases. I could break a piece out of the base without even straining at it.The second was the missing parts: assembly screws for the table insert, blade wrench, handle for the blade height adjustment and a small spring which holds the table insert was bent and useless.As it is I can't start it up due to the loose table insert so I don't know if it really works without ordering missing parts.I'm not happy about this!"
3,students need to have this one......,"as a student of real estate, i have found this book very helpful and i use it as a supplement to my required course readings. if you are a first time home buyer or anyone needing knowledge about todays real estate market, definitely and totally skip it. it is more of a text book than a buyers guide. there is an enormous amount of legal jargon, terminolgy and technical material covered here. But again, well worth every penny if you need extra clarification on legal and financial issues regarding the whole real estate process."

2,"Alas, not for Treo600","Unfortunately, this device will not work with the palmOne Treo 600, despite the Product Specification sheet for the Treo 600's specific claim that its SDIO port could be used to support a bluetooth card... This is apparently because of an incompatibility between the Palm OS5 operating system used on the Treo600 and the palmOne bluetooth card.Beyond that, the form factor is ""problematic"" at best, as the ""antenna"" on the bluetooth card sticks out quite a bit from the edge of the phone."
3,"works OK with latest drivers, but it sticks out way too far","I didn't realize how far this would protrude from my m515. I think I'd prefer a tungsten at this point. The manufacturer (Toshiba) is supposed to start selling one that is substantially shorter, so it protrudes only half as much.The software that came with it is quite bugtastic. I found myself resetting my poor palm many times a day when using bluetooth networking. This improved greatly when I downloaded palm's updated drivers and software. Now it's only as buggy as the applications I run (unfortunately that's still awfully buggy!)."
5,Lovely Product.,"When I first was introduced to bluetooth I found myself looking for bluetooth devices. The first one that came to mind was the Palm handheld. I decided to fork out the [money] and buy one of these cards for my Palm m505, and I don't regret it. The card is extremely small, and fits in my Palm carrying case.The card works well with MacOS X and my D-Link Bluetooth USB Adaptor. I can sync my m505 wireless using this bluetooth card, and better yet, I can be 30 feet away from my computer, I can sit on the couch and sync my m505.The card should also work with bluetooth compliant phones, this is another nice touch."
4,Palm One Bluetooth SDIO Card,I had to return this item as it wasn't compatible with my Garmin IQue 4 gps that has a windows operating system.
3,this book is a great review of the CIA,"For culinary students: if you don't care about the CIA, then skip this one (read his other book called soul of a chef, it's great). Although it's interesting to learn about the curriculum offered at the CIA, it's not really anything I needed to know in order to succeed in the culinary field."
2,Needs Salt !!!,"When I first read the review of this book I had just purchased The New Pro.Chef and I have had dreams of attending the Culinary Institute. So my sights were set a little high. They fell like one of my souffles. I feel the author did a good job describing some of the staff and made them a seem as pompus as I have heard they are. The book did'nt present the flavor of the Externship very well. Also, Not much sense of campus life (the author lived off campus). Sometimes it's hard to follow. I wish I could recommend another book, but I've never read one similar. So it maybe worth a shot. But not for $20."
4,A deeply inspiring read.,"As an avid amateur cook and onetime kitchen gofer, I find it delightful and inspiring to read about the CIA, and the experiences of the students there. This is a book I return to again and again, when ever the daily round of feeding my family becomes dull or mundane - it reminds that 1) it could be worse and 2) of that (long lost in me) chef attitude of 'get it done'."
3,good book,"good book if you want to know the inside of how the CIA works,very informative.drags a little bit.but okay i think."
5,Heart + Humor = Good Reporting,"Michael Ruhlman's first-hand account of going through culinary school dispels any myths about what it's like to become an actual chef. While Ruhlman was immersed in the process of becoming a chef, he was also able to reflect on the many aspects of culinary education, providing insight into his classmate's and his own motivations. I found the mixture of warmth and humor to be charming and reveling. In the end, he made me feel like I was going to CIA too."
3,"Excellent Ingredients, Half-Baked","This should have been a great read. The topic is facscinating, the 'follow along with the CIA cirriculum' approach perfect in theory, yet the final result is merely lukewarm.Some chapters, like those on the basic skills class and front of the house service, are playful and interesting, but far too many get lost in undermotivated detail and a lack of meaningful context. The text continually goes off on random tangents into classmates' histories or the author's personal concerns. The ongoing, awestruck coverage of the CIA's President is simply goofy, but further damages the author's credibility.The author makes much of his becoming a real cook, but perhaps needed to focus a little more on becoming an accomplished writer. There is much of interest here for anyone interested in professional cooking, but it's disappointingly haphazard -- with a little more planning and organization this book could have really soared."
4,Enjoyable read,"I love cooking and baking, so it was quite interesting to learn more about the ins and outs of the CIA and to hear of a pseudo-student's perspective of the experience. Michael Ruhlman has an easy-to-read, captivating writing style and, especially toward the end, he was quite entertaining (e.g., the Cro-Magnon part). Not only does the author do a great job at depicting the different personalities of his teachers and classmates, he is also skilled at conveying the true passion and dedication of these and other cooks. It would have been even better if he were there as a full-fledged student so he could write (and we could read) about the real thing."
5,A Fascinating Look Behind The Scenes of the CIA,"Having lived in the Mid-Hudson Valley for many years, and having visited the Culinary Institute on many occasions, my wife and I really enjoyed this book. Especially for everyday ""chefs"" who fancy the idea of turning ""pro"", this book provides an intriguing look at the training that is provided at the U.S.A.'s premier cooking school, the Culinary Institute of America. As well, it provides a fascinating look at the people involved in the process: classmates, instructors, executive chefs, and the president of the CIA. We both enjoyed this book tremendously and recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed a fine meal out and has wondered, ""How did they learn to do that?"" Bon Appetit!"
2,Disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers who have some problems with this book. First, I don't think the book is very well written. There are some clumsy passages. The writer also comes across as a bit of a whiner. He tries to convey the passion it takes to become a chef, yet it doesn't work, probably because it is secondhand. It is like seeing a friend who is in love, and trying to write about being in love, even though you have never been in love yourself. So for me this book fell flat, and I would not recommend it."
2,Yawn...the CIA should pay for this publicity!,"I read this book before enrolling at the CIA. While the descriptions of the school are fairly accurate (it is a very stressful environment and there are many passionate and talented students and instructors), the writing itself is insipid and seems to pander to the CIA's teachers and administration (and indulge in more than a fair amount of ego-stroking to boot). What Rulhman seems to lack in his overly abundant coverage of the food industry and its players is a really compelling story. His florid descriptions from everything to making stock to the mache in the walk-in bespeak a writer suffering from thesaurus overruse rather than an interesting plot or an artful writing style."
3,not bad for a really old book,"I didn't mind that it was more than ten years old (its from the last century - lol!), it was still intersting. But I like this book I'm reading now better because the author was a real full time student and not just taking a few classes and because the book is recent. If you want a historical perspective, I'd recommend reading both because it is interesting to see how culinary schools were then and how they are now in this book:Culinary School: Three Semesters of Life, Learning, and Loss of Blood"
4,Very Enjoyable,"I thought this was a creative look at the culinary world. It starts out from an outsider's perspective who is then transformed into an insider who views the world forever differently. I read this a while ago while I was still in culinary school and completely identified with his trials, failures, successes and discoveries. This was a very good read and I enjoyed it."
5,great insight into a world apart,"We've all heard the horror stories of med school, of law school, of driver's ed. Well, learing to cook has entered the fray. It's amazing to read about the dedication required, the skills one is expected to master, even the politics behind the scenes. A great read from all lovers of food, and those who pursue excellence in any field."
4,Thinking of cooking school? READ THIS BOOK.,"This book is what it's like to attend culinary school. It's hot, tiring, on-your-feet-all-day work, and anyone that thinks cooking in a professional kitchen is fun and glamorous and simply putting pretty food on a nice plate needs to sit and read this book. Yes, an inordinate amount of time may be spent telling the reader dozens of details on how to make a clear consomme, but it's meant to explain the fact that something as simple as clear, richly flavored ""broth"" is not necessarily easy. There is an enormous amount of prep work in a kitchen before anything ever hits a warm plate. This gets close to giving the reader a good idea about the realities of working in a professional kitchen. Bravo!!"
5,A peek inside the complex world of culinary education.,"Through Mr. Ruhlman's book, I experienced what life at the Culinary must be like. It gave me an appreciation for the planning, commitment, dedication, and stamina that today's culinary professionals must embody. It is clear that Mr. Ruhlman enjoyed his time at the Culinary and he reports fairly and accurately. Because of my background in educational administration, the pace of education (students gradutating to be replaced with new students every three weeks!) was most astounding to me, as was the sheer volume of food generated by the institution. Mr. Ruhlman is to be commended on capturing the life of a student of culinary education. This book should be required reading for all those considering a career in culinary arts."
1,ripped off,This product does not work! I went to the manufacturer's website to get support to fix the problem and what they suggested did not work! They offer no other solutions and I had to return the product. Don't waste your time or money on this sham of a product!
1,How do I install this?,"I completely agree with Parent on this one! I would like to give it 0 stars, but I can't. I got this product for my daughter who just started kindergarten, and when I went to install it said my system was not compatible? Okay then... I don't know where to go to get troubleshooting advice on how to install the game for my system, and now I have a very sad and disappointed crying 6 year old who doesn't understand why mommy wont let her play her new game. So nice to have a product for children that even adults can't figure out how to run."
5,Very good book,"I read this book during a book study class at my church. It provided a lot of insight that really spoke to me. I had always thought I could handle stress by control or sheer will. Now I jump on the dragon and enjoy the ride. Life will happen, it is up to us to decide whether it happens with us or in spite of us! God bless you all."
3,comments,Good book only a lot of comments are written inside the supposedly good as new book ..too bad ..
1,Poorly written book,I was disappointed by this book. The book is very dated. Several things discussed in the book as successes have fallen by the wayside.
1,Utter garbage - too bad there aren't sub 1 star reviews,"What a collosal waste of time this book is.The authors obviously don't have much of a grasp on e-business. The book is poorly organized and written in such poor style that it was a torture to finish.Poor writing, poor execution from infantile minds."
3,Nice for a new person,This is a nice thumb threw book for a person new to the Windows XP OS but if you are a more advance user you will have not need for this book i gave it to my aunt who is not so good with a computer and needed some help and it gets her threw the basics but i still get calls for help every now and then lol
4,Slave to the Rhythm...,"I can't improve on what the others have said about this effort by Miss Jones. But...an FYI...On the ""Private-Life-Compass-Point-Sessions"" CD, you will find the extended version of ""Slave to the Rhythm.""Slave to the Rhythm times:1. Slave to the Rhythm : 6:352. Compass-Point-Sessions: 8:10 (Hot Blooded Mix)Don't worry folks, the ""Hot Blooded Mix"" is better than the album version (which is still a great song at 6:35, by the way!) Again, just putting it ""out there"" for your information! Four stars!"
5,"Island Masters ver. IS NOT the Orignial ""Slave to the Rhythm""!!","THE ISLAND MASTERS VERSION OF ""SLAVE TO THE RHYTHM"" IS NOT THE VERSION THAT WAS RELEASED ON CD IN 1987/1990.The interviews with Grace Jones are not in this release at all, it's six minutes shorter, and the track listing has been ordered differently. I ordered this recently thinking I had lost the ""Slave to the Rhythm"" I had, only to find it and I compared them. I'm not sure why the interviews with Grace have been taken out, the different order of the tracks, and different versions of the songs, but wanted to let all you guys know the difference. Hopefully there will be a remastered version in the future with the original copy of the 1985 release of this amazing album by Miss Grace Jones.I give it 5 stars only for the original release, and 0 stars for this cheap copy. It's a shame the brilliance of 1985's ""Slave to the Rhythm"" will not be heard by anyone who buys this copy.Good luck on finding the original.."
3,"It's certainly Japan, but not as good as Gentlemen nor Tin Drum","This album/CD has all of Japan's sonic trademarks. I've read a number of comments that this is the culmination of Japan's vision. I disagree. It's not terribly exciting, nor does it have a particularly coherent viewpoint. Problem is, I'm comparing Quiet Life to Gentlemen Prefer Polaroids and Tin Drum, which, to me, stand out as both superbly insightful and energetic outings."
4,Stressfest,"I am the music lover for all kinds of good music, I like to have all information and any recommend or any new releases from you, not only Guitar Heroes or Progressive Rock, Hard Rock, Heavy Metal, Alternative ETC."
5,Steve Morse at his best,"If you like the virtuosity of steve morse and really like the bluesy riffs he likes to jump into many of his tracts, you must have this cd. If you have never bought a Steve Morse cd, and like satriani, get this one."
4,a current Deep purple gutar man,"Doesn't anybody know that this guy is a current DEEP PURPLE guitar man? Mr MORSE ex kansas and DIXIE DREGS is today a current DEEP PURPLE guitar man, replaced a guitar old veteran Ritchie blackmore in 1995. This solo album is a part of his super career, if you love DEEP PURPLE as a fave band, you will like his solo work too. The whole songs are full of ballad and good technical guitar solo. There are no bad songs in his solo album.....AMAZING!"
5,An Advanced Book on Detection Theory,"This is perhaps the best book available for advanced detection theory. The probabalistic underpinnings are discussed at length. A lot of the other reviews complain about the mathematical difficulty of this text; however, it is an advanced text. Not all texts are required to be accessible to beginners in the subject. If you want to become an expert in detection theory, this is the next step after your introductory course(s). To really get there, you need to have experience in the applications as well.If you don't have some background in detection theory or at least hypothesis testing, then in my estimation this is probably not the book for you. On the other hand if the myriad texts available are beginning to appear to be a little bit weak on the probability/statistics analysis of signals, then this is the book for you."
1,Worst textbook I ever had,"This book manages to describe even straight-forward concepts in a way that is simply incomprehensible. If you are learning the material, you often have to read a paragraph many times to make any sense out of it. And let's not blame it on the concepts, what it comes down to is confusing presentation and terrible use of English language.I can't believe it has second edition."
1,Post-Doctoral Math Requirement,"This book will be of interest to many post-doctoral Harvard/Oxford mathematicians. However, if you are a mere mortal, don't waste your time. Rather than trying to explain concepts and educate the reader, the book obfuscates each concept with the help of endless formulas and greek symbols. Most of the readers time is spent trying to follow the ""where:"" and ""From this and Eq. (2.3) we have:"" and ""Then:"" interspersed with higher mathematics. Very little of the english language was used to convey any idea that may help the reader."
3,don't expect the film to follow the book and you'll enjoy watching it,"The beginning captivates the viewer and the movies has a decent story. Having said that, it's also worth mentioning that the storyline is hardly Michael Chabon's and why the changes were made (from the book) is unclear, however, as a stand-alone it seems to work (if you ignore that it's a novel adaptation and think of it as a standalone film). It's no the most engaging movie nor is it the worst movie ever. If you haven't read the book or don't mind watching the movie and can refrain from comparing it to the book, there's a good chance that you'll like it."
5,A great Mystery?,"The protagonist is easy to follow in this film. You're instantly on his side, with is unlikeable father and the touchy situation he's put himself in. Forget all the sexual hangups, why aren't more people like him?Good acting and script make it an enjoyable film.No need in spoiling the ending for you. See it."
3,The Seeds of Greatness,"Paula Volsky's work is incomprable. She manages to mix politics, intrigue, horror, suspense, romance, history and fantasy together to form gripping novels. In ""The Curse of the Witch-Queen,"" (Ms. Volsky's first book) we see the beginnings of her inimitable style: the court of Szar, the Sorcerer King, the slatkum (an alien creature), the whispering portraits. However, her voice is by no means complete by this time. ""The Curse of the Witch-Queen"" is ""cursed"" by a split plot, a ""quest"", expedient characters, and unsteady linguistics. Long-time devotees of Ms. Volsky's work will doubtless find great pleasure reading her first novel, with its hints of Illusion's Sentients and even The Wolf of Winter's necromancy, but those first reading Ms. Volsky's work would do better to seek out her recent novels, particularly Illusion."
4,Great gym bag for those who have to change clothes,"I use this all the time for my workouts at the gym. Whether I go in street clothes and carry my workout gear and shave kit, flip flops, towel, etc, or if I go in workout clothes and haul street clothes, it has enough capacity for everything. What I really like are that there are two large side pockets that are waterproof so if you have soaked, nasty workout clothes or wet shoes or such, you can put them inside these pockets and keep other items dry in the main compartment. It's pretty lightweight and at the same time holds it's shape well. Would make a good weekend travel bag as well.Plenty of small pockets for cell phones, iPods, wallets, etc as well - great gym bag and at $50 for some colors, a great value."
4,"Solid, Reliable","A gift to a very nice young man. Sturdy, roomy and not too shabby looking. A good asset in most type of circumstances. Hopefully to be used over and over for a long period of time. He seemed to like the gift but we did not conduct a survey of his impressions so once again I based my decision to purchase on the fine reviewers that bless amazon.com with their opinions and ratings. 4 Stars."
4,high sierra duffle bag,"Like this bag alot, has plenty of pockets for dirty laundry or wet clothes or shoes. The only con I have about this bag is that the zippers don't move as easily as they should."
5,Back In The Good Old Days,"This is how it was to be young! Growing up in cold Norway I could only imagine how the south of The States was like. Listening to DNC helped alot. A splendid mixture of hard-rock, folk, country.... A truly fantastic record, perhaps their best ever. Play it LOUD in your car. I guarantee you wish to go fast, very fast."
4,great disc,Anyone from the good old south should know this album and enjoy it. i first listened to i while in college and it rocks!! takes me back to those days
4,Very over looked Southern Band,"Good ol'boy Southern fried classic rock that is very consistent from the beginning to the end of the album. I get the feeling,if this album is any indication,that they are more than a beer drinkin'and hell raisin' type of band.The song arrangements and production appear to be very fresh and clear to me considering that this album was made in the late '80's.These guys seem to exude a dedication and maturity that to me makes them seem to be a very tight musical unit that writes great lyrics and plays strongly as they whip thru each tune.It's a shame that although DnC has a great history and following in the south that they weren't bigger than one hit wonders(Remember Fly Me Courageous?) in the rest of the states.They are still out there chugging along.Try this one out."
2,poor quality reproduction,When I ordered this CD...I was very much looking forward to it's arrival and I expected that it would be in good condition.What I got was a very poor reproduction that skips throughout the entire cd.We have several cd players in the house and it's sad quality is quite evident.I won't be ordering from this merchant again.
4,Interesting Collection,"This is an interesting, odd little collection for Karloff fans. I don't think you'll be disappointed although the ""Boogie Man..."" is a little odd."
3,Info: NO FRENCH SUBTITLES!,"I won't comment here about the fine picture and sound quality of these films, as other reviewers have done so and very well too, or about the quality of the films themselves. But, as a French buyer, I wanted to warn potential buyers that THERE ARE NO FRENCH SUBTITLES to the films on this set, contrarily to the product description on amazon. If non-english speaking Karloff fans are interested in this box set, they should know what the product is really like. Have a nice day."
4,Crazy for Karloff!!!!,I love Karloff and have never seen him give a bad performance. That being said I recommend all fans grab this set as the Hang movies are worth every cent. Karloff holds these movies together and it all works through his presence. They are entertaining and I feel you can not go wrong with a karloff film.
4,Good set for Karloff fans,An excellent collection of rarer Karloff fright films. The surprise is the comedy THE BOOGIE MAN WILL GET YOU which is a delight. A good set at a great price.
4,Very Surprising Results,"I had read reviews of the product on the internet, and decided to give them a try. My hair is pretty thick, i.e. it takes forever to dry, and it has a slight wave to it that is awful looking. When I used them, my hair was very curly, and I put it up in a ponytail. I hate hairspray, and only used a spritz or two of Herbal Essences. My curls lasted all day!The only difficulties I had were starting the curl, because the hair would sometimes slip out. Other than that, it would get tangled a little when taking them out, but gentle shaking helped greatly.These are a great product, and I would recommend them to many people.P.S. My curls received lots of comments!"
4,curls hold,"I have long, thick, straight, never holds a curl hair. I've used these while living in South Carolina, (humid, humid humid) and even on rainy days I got comments that my hair looked wonderful. Highly recommended. Only four stars, cause they do tend to tangle, but it's worth it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Ok, this has to be the worst product I have EVER BOUGHT!!! It is impossible to use, and the results don't last at all! I followed the directions one night, and after struggling to get them in my hair, I went to sleep. The next morning I woke up, took out the rollers, and had gorgeous curls. But, I saw a tiny tangle, and gently ran a finger through it. The entire curl went straight! Plus, after spraying it with hairspray and walking around a little, they were ALL GONE!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is a complete waste of money, and just really pissed me off! Spare yourself the frustration and DO NOT BUY!!!!"
4,Truly a day in the life of...,"I purchased this book because my great-great-grandfather served in the same company (Co I, 2nd MI Inf) as Charles Haydon. This is as close as I will ever get to knowing what he experienced. Anyone who had a relative in the 2nd Michigan and wants to know more should read this book. Haydon mentions a number of fellow soldiers so there is a remote chance there is a reference. Haydon describes the countryside they traveled through, what they ate and gave his opinions of his commanders.My one criticism of the book is that there were no maps. I dug out and borrowed a couple of books that had battlefield maps so that I could get a better sense of the 2nd's movements. I think the book could have benefited from several maps."
4,Treasure trove for fanatics,"This collection is marvelous as a broad-strokes portrait of the music Americans were recording and listening to in a time well before the hegemony of the corporate conglomerate recording industry, when anyone with the admittedly cumbersome apparatus of the time could start their own record company. None of these songs were huge hits of their time, but many of them are treasures of American roots music. I've got to say, though, that it was the R. Crumb cover art that pulled me in."
4,some track info is in fact available,"As many reviewers have noted or decried, the packaging for this marvelous set contains no extra information about the tracks beyond track and artist names. However, if you rip the album in a program that connects to the Gracenote database, someone seems to have uploaded the year for all the tracks on disc 2. Also for disc 2 listed is a single, undoubtedly incorrect, composer for all the tracks, likely an accident."
4,Yazoo Has Gone to the Dogs,"I can't figure out why Yazoo likes to deny us basic info such as recording dates. I'm not even gettin' nit picky, just a year will do. But noooo, they can't be bothered. It's no wonder the competition has left them in the dust. (And they do this to the cd issues of original vinyl releases, too: STRIP the recording dates that were clearly listed on the vinyl issues. To Hell with you, Shanachie!"
4,A Woman's Heart: A Decade On,"What a beautiful collection of celtic music! This CD combines many talented artists into one. I got excited about it when I heard a song from it, ""Down to the River to Pray"" on RadioCelt.com. This song is amazing. It's the kind of song that makes everyone within hearing range stop and listen. A great selection."
2,Don't waste your money,I really wanted to like this book but I could barely get through it. It wasn't interesting and I hated the stories. A huge disappointment.
2,Fivespeed Destroy all other bands here,"With the exception of local greats, Fivespeed (AZ! ), this cd drags. I bought it hoping it would have the same drive as the third emo diaries, which i highly recommend. Saddly, i've never been this disapointed by a deep elm release. Every band sounds the same, and its more poppy, poopy, simplistic,junk than emo. if you want a good comp, buy Emo Diaries III! The Twohundred North!"
5,"Traffic Ahead, On Tour","One benefit of being an old dude? Being able to say I saw Traffic on October 20, 1971 when they toured to promote LSOHHB which would be released the next month. It was already getting plenty of play on the airwaves. Winwood and crew played in a little gym at tiny Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana. Just amazing. Imagine, freaking Traffic playing in a gym!! There was a buzz going around before the concert about the stenciling on Jim Gordon's drum kit covers that said Derek and the Dominos. Folks thought Clapton might appear as well. With the amount of mood elevation taking place some folks might think they actually saw him that night! Winwood came out in an all while suit. They played all of LSOHHB plus some of Barleycorn and Mr. Fantasy. LSOHHB is one of the classic albums made only more classic for me having seen Traffic live at the height of their powers. I might be old, but I got that goin' for me!"
2,Love This Entire Album But...,"This particular recording of this all-time classic ""Low Spark of High-heeled Boy"" contained a strange background track - almost as if there was another recording going on in the background that was picked up in the making of the master - like a ghost track of the same song but completely out of phase with the song. I surely don't remember hearing this in the original LP. So this is definitely a quality assurance problem with mastering the CD."
4,Some Of This Is Excellent,The title cut is excellent. Rainmaker is excellent. The rest of this album feels like filler. And what was the big deal about Rock & Roll Stew? Why did it get played so often in the 70s?
4,Spark Me Up,"Traffic is one of my all time favorite groups. I really enjoy listening to the cut of ""Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys"". It sets the mood for mellowing out. I also like the ""Stew"". A great classic rock and roll cd for any collection.Thanks--CDS"
5,beautiful recording,"I love this cd. I can listen to Rainmaker, Low Spark and Hidden Treasure 1,000 times and not tire of them - the music is so extraordinary & eerie - meaningful too.Low spark has this beat like a heart-beat, you can pace your whole life by it. Shades of Bach, which I think, in time, this music will be more & more compared to. I, personally, am not much into the rocking Jim Capaldi numbers, but that is the beauty of cd listening, one can pick & choose. I would recommend everyone who loves music to own this cd. Also check out When the Eagle Flies and Last Exit - two other extraordinary Traffic recordings."
5,One for the ages...,"The 60's changed the way people approached music. From the Beatles to Jimi Hendrix music became much more than a form of entertainment. Became part of everyone'e life. A way to understand and express feelings. Music dictating behavior. Life imitating art. There are a few albums that represent this transformation and ""The Low Spark..."" is definitively one of them. It is not perfect. It is human. Funny, sad, emotional, contradictory, explosive and vain. If you're moving to a isolated island and if you have room in your luggage for only one CD, well, this is the one you should take with you. I promised that you will not forget mankind."
5,very cool,"i think this album is very cool. its great to get if your looking for something different with a 70's sound. every song is so entrancing. especially ""the low spark of high heeled boys""."
5,bears repeated listening,"Although not actually a piano/drum duet cd, perhaps it should have been: Winwood at his peak, with, possibly the world's best drummer, Jim Gordon, doing a stint with the band."
3,Flawed Classic,"This is a great slice of 70's FM radio, but extended piano solos are not Mr. Winwood's forte."
4,traffic fans take note!,"Hey... it's back in print - and the sound is much better than the old one, or _Smiling Phases_, or that hideously echo-drenched Winwood box. Plus, reappearing after 30 years is the long-forgotten extended version of ""Rock and Roll Stew"", which originally appeared in two parts on the single."
5,Purchased as a gift.,"Even tho I purchased this CD as a gift for a friend, they were blown away by the music. Just like the record she told me. Ha ha. Yep we are 'old'! But the music never dies. This CD rendition is very well done. Bravo."
4,Just Jamming,"This album was a real surprise to me. An avid listener to Guitar orientated rock albums, this really blew me away. Not that its anything like you'd expect, but a musical journey with out being over the top in extravagance. If you dont have any Traffic albums this is were to start. You will enjoy over and over again."
5,A Fine Line,"This amazing album straddles the fine line between rock and jazz in a way that very few artists have successfully been able to do. The title cut and ""Rainmaker"" are positively trance-inducing. Highly recommended."
5,Low Spark,"Almost 40 years after it was recorded, this album still has what it takes. Listen to it a few times and you will hear yourself humming it on the way to work or play."
4,A classic recording,"This is a great place to start if you want to get into Traffic. The early recordings are very hippy Berkshire Poppy sound,is very experimental where as this recording is when in my opinion Traffic peaked. RnR and jazz influenced sound just seemed to work here, a balance of both genres. If you like the more reflective songs(Rainmaker,Many a Mile to Freedom) then give John Barleycorn Must Die a listen and if the RnR tunes (RocknRoll Stew,Light up or Leave Me Alone) are your cup of tea give Last Exit a try."
4,I am the author,"Brendan Collins, though a moron, has sand enough to sign his name. The rest of you one-and-two-star louts, why do you hide so? As for the Ellis fan in Korea, try actual sentences next time. Then perhaps try burning your awful novel. And don't disparage old ladies in gardens. They know more of the world than you ever will."
2,linguistic nonsense,"iwent in expecting a fairly interesting book, not necessarily a conventional story nevertheless an interesting read. it was niether. its billed a savage and dark satire. abolute b.s. this is simply boring. it is true he has the occasional good turn of phrase. but let me tell you this ishow it breaks down there is a spectrum of satire in contemporary lit. on the one end you have ellis who in my estimation is far funnier and scathing and on the opposite you have that hack dave barry. well for poor old lipsyte. i would have ot say he was separated at birth from barry. this book is for little old ladies who want to sip theirtea in the gardem thats how dark it is. bruuuuuutal"
1,I burned my copy,"Generally I'm against burning books. A person's thoughts are important, as is everyone's right to read the thoughts and stories of someone else. I didn't burn the book as an effort to enforce censorship, but rather my anger at the book for having taken up as much time as it had. The book is slim, yet I found myself struggling through it, forcing myself to read it. I truly hated this book.Every sentence attempts to be clever. It seemed to be an attempt at writing by someone in high school who does not have assistance from an editor. Some lines were genuinely amusing and insightful, but it was so difficult to stomach the rest of it to get to them.In burning the book, and writing this review I have freed myself from the despair I had felt.Thank you."
2,Weird,"I was intrigued within the first 50 pages or so because of the direction it seemed to be heading. Then it got bland in the middle . It just seemed to be the same thing spit over and over to the reader. It did have its high moments in the middle. Then at the end of the book it got better, but it was hard to get through the 2nd third of the book, it probably goes deeper than i gave it. I really didn't get into it, so that may be why, also I am still a teenager but I did get most of the satire. My recommendation is that it's one of those books you have to read yourself to judge because you may take it a different way. It just wasn't for me."
2,Not Lipsyte's Best,"I loved The Ask so I decided to pick up Subject Steve. Unfortunately, this book just left me cold. The premise of the book is great and there are some genuinely funny and original moments in the text, but after about the first 100 pages the story just drifts through random encounters. Read The Ask instead."
3,Loved spa-hated remote control,"I loved the spa when I could get it to work. This foot bath can ONLY be operated using the remote control, therefore if the remote goes so goes your foot bath. I could not get the spa to turn on again if I wanted to use it more than once a day. I turned it on for about 10 minutes then had to run an errand. The machine would not turn on again until the next day!!"
1,So lame I returned it,The bubbles were weak.The 'rolling massager' means you roll your foot over this spindle thing. The rotating pedicure knob didn't work. The remote was missing.
2,Too Noisey,"If you are looking for a relaxing experience, look elsewhere - unless you like loud vibrating noise.....it has lots of features that sounded great but too much noise."
3,I like it.,It's not like being at the spa but it's the best at home foot soaker/massager I've seen. Pretty good for the price. I'll use it often. Note that the water is not heated but supposed to just stay warm.
1,"Too many yucks, not enough worthwhile test taking strategies","I agree my fellow reviewer who descrbes this book as LOL -- the only downside is that I'm worried about the SAT, I'm taking it pretty serious, and some of the authors' smug sophomoric jokes get on my nerves. If I want to laugh, I'll watch South Park. If I want to get into college, I'm going to have to study with something better than this."
3,not too impressed with it,"I've tried this product, the color of my highligts has faded somewhat, I thought this product would help to keep the color, but it hasn't. It smells nice and leaves the hair soft."
2,Not That Good,"This had a decent smell but does not lather. So I swished it in my hair twice in order to feel like I got everything. It did make my hair shiny, soft and smooth without stripping the hair color the first couple of times I used it. After the third time my hair was stiff with buildup."
3,Henna Color Fixation,The printing on this bottle is so small no one could possibly read it. After I used it I liked how my hair felt.
5,Excellent and reliable,"Excellent company. I did not pay any extra expediting shipping, but the product came as describe in 2 days. I will definitly become a customer"
2,Potentially a good story but written with no continuity,I looked forward to reading the book but found it very disconnected and boring in places. There were so many gaps in the narration that I found it difficult to keep up my enthusiasm and interest. What could have been a great story was mediocre at best. The story deserved better treatment.
2,Very poor development of the main character,"The interweaving of the writers' own experience of Cuba could have been potentially interesting in contrast or parallel to the telling of the Naty Revuelta's story. Apart from the fact that they both came from wealthy families, how they tie together (except social class must have helped her get the story) is unpersuasively developed. Hopefully the real Naty is far more interesting than the character painted. The presumed despair and disillusionment of the wealthy after the revolution was insufficiently presented to move me one bit. Fidel is portrayed entirely unsympathetically. The poor are hardly mentioned. The idealism of the revolutionaries are mentioned in passing. What exactly was the point of it? Naty as metaphor for Cuba? Maybe, but that's a pretty simplistic reading of Cuba--one of the great tragedies and dreams of this century. All in all, not much of a morsel."
5,Homework Helper Help for Parents,"We bought this as a tool to help us, help our middle school student with math homework. Frankly, about middle school the kids start applying math concepts which most parents have forgotten. For us, this book was just what we needed to jog our memories. The illustrations are clear, the explanations concise. It's well-organized and easily referenced. It's a relatively slim book, but sturdy - not at all daunting in appearance. Now that she has entered high school and is too independent to ask mom and dad for help, it serves her has a reference."
4,What a beautiful and colorful visual presentation of math!,"I bought this book for my 5th grader so she'd have a quick resource to go to when doing math homework. He school math book sometimes does not have good viauals to go along with the work. This book has alot of wonderful drawings/illustrations to go along with the text. It could use some more illustrations and some ""basic"" math definitions are not covered...that is why I only gave the book a 4 out of 5 stars. Really, I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. The book is so pretty and keeps my daughter interested in reading it I am sure because of the colors and the texture of the pages.This is a small-ish book...about 1/6th the size of the Osburne science book. It is easy to browse and again, is just a lovely looking book. I think it is great for elementary and middle school aged kids and can be a great review/resource book for high school aged kids."
4,"Raw, sweet, unlayered and all round satisfying","After finding one on clearance at Rasputins I snapped it up on a hunchy whim. Man, did I luck out. With Christopher Lowell Clarke on trumpet and Dewayne Oakley on bass and vocals the duo just rocks with mostly standards laced with a deliciously raw edge. Oakley's vocals are fresh and disarmingly off the cuff while Clarke's (trumpet) tone is fat, full, breathy and raunchy in all the right places. On the double bass rhythm end of things Oakley holds down like the future of the planet depended on it. A couple of times he takes a bow to it with pleasantly edgy results.The strongest tracks are the instrumental ones, 1 to 6. Clarke's edgy interpretation of the standards from Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"" to Charmichael's ""Stardust"" definitely make this a collectable. The rawness of this outing is what sells me on it hook, line and sinker. It's like you are sitting in a room live with Oakley noodlin' and Clarke blowin'.Oh blow, brother-MAN blow!"
1,Don't buy,"I have been very unhappy with this little canner...not the size or operation, but the rusting of the weights. I am not the only one with this problem. The weight gets rusty and spews rust all over your canner and stove!My old Mirro with a different weight does not have this problem.I gave it away and bought a small All-American.My advice, buy a Presto or All-American."
1,Not what it claims,"I received this as a gift for Christmas, and found that it should hold 5 quarts, but it wouldn't close. I struggled, read the (simple) directions over and over again, and I could only get one quart in before it would close, and that was if it was sitting right in the middle of the pot. Frustrating! I thought it was just me until I read a few other reviews online where others had the same problem. As soon as I read it I boxed it up and took it back. I'm going to buy the Presto 23 quart, great reviews online and is supposed to hold 24 half-pints, 20 pints, or 7 quarts--AND close :)"
4,Pressure canner,"I just started canning. This will work for people who only can a few jars at a time. I used this to pressure cook beans, it was difficult to figure out the first time. The metal ball on top has parts that you add or remove to decide the pressure 5, 10, or 15 psi. When the correct pressure is reached the ball raises and lets out steam, this is very loud and frightening. You need to reset this every time it falls off of the vent. Overall, a fine pressure canner."
5,Good Canner,"I needed a pressure canner for canning produce from my garden. I knew TFal was a good name in cookware, and I missed using a pressure cooker, since I'd grown up with my Mom using one. This canner works well, and is easy to use and clean. The instructions are easy to follow."
2,Early L&H collaboration,"This 1927 two reeler wasn't produced with teamwork in mind for Laurel and Hardy (surprisingly, considering the earlier DUCK SOUP and DO DETECTIVES THINK presented the boys virtually complete as the characters we know and love). Even so, the scenes they share show glimmers of great things to come. This is an amusing comedy, with Stan and Ollie trying to protect employer Jimmy Finlayson from blackmailing in-laws by trying to hideout in an amusement park funhouse! The situations may be ordinary, but Laurel and Hardy give them some flair, and Finlayson has his share of funny moments as well. Also some wonderful footage of funhouse exhibits that probably now only exist in the memories of people who visited them years ago."
5,CST/Berger aluminum 8' rod,"Great product really nothing else to be said. Would recommend to anyone. Light, easy to read,use and holds set well."
3,flavor blends,"I have been using regular splenda for awhile now and I like flavored coffee, so I decided to try this product. It packs more of a ""flavor punch"" when I mixed it with another liquid flavored creamer. This product does not leave an after taste."
1,Don't waste your money,"In a word--YUCK!!!!!!!!!!! Bitter tasting, not sweet at all with a weird aftertaste. I spent alot of money on this product and was very disapointed."
3,Mediocre,"Not so great, but not bad. It is a mediocre product. I first got hazelnut flavor, amazed by the exceptional smell and taste, bought this one immediately, expecting a similar quality. A little bit frustrated. The taste is a little weak for 1 tube per 16 oz coffee; too sweet when 2 tubes per 16 oz coffee. Too many adjustments kill the purpose. Get a box from the grocery and then go for the 6-pack only if you like it."
5,Splenda not in Canada -Yet?,"My sister,Pearlie, who lives in Canada requested that I try to find the Splenda Vanilla Coffee Flavored sweetner. I searched in grocery stores in NY state and in PA and could not fine any. Of course, Amazon was next on my list. No Problem. Amazon delivered 12 boxes in a few days and I passed it on to my sister the next time we went home. I tried the Splenda and it was very great and a nice hint of flavor. Hopefully, Spenda will widen their sales range. Thanks Amazon, I can always count on your services."
3,Splenda flavor blends-FV,Mmmm! great to take with you. I keep a couple in my purse. A little expensive for everyday use especially if you drink more than 2cups of coffee a day.
3,Tastes like Playdoh,"It tastes too artificial for my liking when put in a small cup of coffee. I have adjusted to put one packet in a large mug with about 1-1/2 cups of coffee and two tablespoons of fat free creamer, and it tastes a bit better that way. I can tolerate it since I have been trying to eliminate calories and fat from my coffee, but it's not ideal. I will not repurchase. And I also tried the mocha but gave it away because I disliked it so much. Try unsweetened cocoa and regular Splenda instead."
4,Splenda Flavored No Calorie Sweeteners,"These Splenda sweeteners come in a few different flavors...mocha, hazelnut, and french vanilla. I use these in combination with some non-fat coffee creamer. Until I tried this product, I used regular flavored coffee creamers that contained fat as one of their ingredients. Overall taste was rich. When Splenda introduced this product, I was able to migrate to the non-fat flavored coffee creamers without much loss of richness. It was simply a matter of adding one of these flavored packets to my coffee in combination with the non-fat creamer. You lower your fat intake; your calorie intake; and retain the rich flavor. Great product."
3,"Different amounts in each packet,.... :(","I LOVE the product, BUT, because each packet has a different amount in it, I could not give it 5*. I wrote to the company, & they never replied. It's really a pain in the neck, not knowing how sweet my coffee will be, with each packet. I wish they made it in bulk, so I could use just the right amount each time,...........but, then the company wouldn't make ALL the $$$$$$they do on the small packets. :("
5,"Quick, convenient, tastes naughty but is oh so good","I stash these at work and of course at home. Each small stick is enough for 1 large cup of coffee (I fill my to go cup all the way). The flavor is pretty strong - so some people who actually call 1 cup a cup of coffee (unlike my generous 3 cup ""cups"") may want to only use half a stick at a time. The taste is wonderful, very rich, no funny aftertaste. The sticks are very small and while easy to open, have stood up to weeks of riding around in my crammed full purse. Who needs sugar and cream anymore? I was less impressed with the caramel ones - but these have helped me kick my expensive and not so healthy caramel macchioto habit."
1,Not enough to do the job,"It is OK, but is not really strong enough to do the job of flavoring your coffee. It takes a lot of this item to make any difference at all."
2,For Laurel and Hardy Buffs only!,"Laurel and Hardy aren't the polished comedy duo we would see in their later films, but even at this point-early in their teaming-it's obvious we are looking at two diamonds in the rough. Sadly, the film is not complete, large segments are missing, it's a silent, and watching it is not for the casual viewer, hence my two star rating. But if you're a Laurel and Hardy buff (I have been since a young boy) it's an opportunity to see the boys when their screen personas were still being honed, eventually resulting in the the greatest comic duo of all time. Sadly, their kind will not pass this way again. As I said, if you're a Laurel and Hardy buff go for it; if you're not a Laurel and Hardy buff I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to see the greatest pie fight of all time!"
5,A must read planning guide for golfers traveling to Scotland,"Organized and written for the ""Scotch"" (cheapskate) in all of us. How to save on the 20% VAT alone pays for the book."
5,Addictive golf reading !!,"As an avid golfer and reader of all things golf-related, I can say that this book is absolutely without parallel. Thorough, engrossing, entertaining, and eminently satisfying. The author's obvious love of Scotland shines in every paragraph. Planning on visiting Scotland in the next couple of years, I took a chance on this book after reading a review. Woe unto the hapless golfer who doesn't avail himself of this work before making arrangements. A new standard for golf travel writing has been set. Mr. Ferguson WILL be MY itinerary planner for Scotland!"
5,Allan Ferguson Review,"I have been to Scotland six times and utilized ""Golf in Scotland"" for my trip planning and reservations the last four times. The book is outstanding - all phone numbers, email addresses, and visitor policies for golfers are precise and accurate. I also believe the recommendations for golf courses, car rentals, hotel-B&B;'s and general travel tips are first rate.This is the best and most insightful travel guide I have found, and it is all you will need to enjoy a great trip to Scotland. For the first timer, if you decide you want a professional to plan your trip, Allan's rates are very reasonable and he will fulfill all your requirements.JCB"
5,A great book,"I had thought of a trip to Scotland for awhile and about a year ago got somewhat serious. I purchased this book as I didn't think I wanted to have a ""tour"" planned for me. I wanted flexibility if I should go. Once I received the book, I used it, along with a map of Scotland, to plan a potential trip. I got to a point where it was so much fun and interesting, that I thought if I never go on a trip, planning and learning about Scotland was worth the book and the time I was using.Well, we went on our trip in May, 2005. The book was invaluable to our having such a wonderful, wonderful time in Scotland. The book was our introduction, our education and resource for making our trip truly outstanding. If you love golf and have a thought of going to Scotland, don't miss this book."
