5,Required and Suggested,"If you are considering an MBA, read this to know what to expect. If you have an MBA, read this for nostalgia and laughs."
4,looks great,I bought this for my college age son. It looks great-classy yet cutting edge for the younger crowd.
4,A great espionage soap opera,"I've seen the entire series and have off-the-air copies of all but two of the episodes so I refresh my memory of how good this series is often.It's very well written and well performed. The production values are somewhat lacking and some of the political situations described sometimes stretch believability even with what we know NOW about how things were in the late 1970s. Nevertheless, the show is immensely entertaining and the plots are thorougly gripping."
5,The Sandbaggers - Collection 1,"The product arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. The only disappointment was that this Set #1 included only six of the seven eposides from the first year of The Sandbaggers. The seventh is not included and the only way, as far as I can tell to get the seventh eposide, is to buy the entire collection (Sets 1,2 and 3) on DVD."
3,COULD'VE BEEN MUCH BETTER,"I felt this movie was very shallow in its interpretation of events. Not because they were portrayed inaccurately (which was the case, in some instances) but because it omitted pertinent events/people: i.e. Rasputin is almost left out completely - I can only recall seeing him in for a few seconds amongst a group of another people!!!I much preferred Franklin J. Schaffner movie 'Nicholas and Alexandra' (1971) - I thought THAT version was far more comprehensive."
4,Loved this game back then.,"Get you a multitap, and bring in 2 more friends. It had a Brawl Brothers/Final Fight kinda feel to it. You could also customized clothes/skin color etc. of everycharacter (players/goons/bosses), before starting the game.Wish you could change their clothes though. Good music too."
3,"Keeping the peace, baby!! Actually the gameplay is pretty...","...stiff. Without a doubt, this is definitely a better game than Jaleco's earlier release, Rival Turf. That's not saying much, though, as Rival Turf was one of the worst scroll-to-the-right-and-beat-the-hell-out-of-em video games I have ever played in 22 years. The gameplay is stiffer than Larry Flynt's... well, you get the idea. One redeeming factor in this game (besides the playable girl) is the texture-edit mode. If you know what the hell you are doing, you can actually adjust the textures of most of the characters in the game to your liking. It's good for a mindless street fighting game but I wouldn't pay more than eight bucks for it."
5,Excellent,She really has a differant and outstanding voice. It is really a delight to hear her singing and songs of the period.
3,Evil king remains an enigma,"Innumerable books have been written about Richard III, yet there are new ones popping up almost every year. This one is unusual since it takes a hostile view on the King (otherwise most books about Richard III nowadays tend to portray him as a near saint, too kind for this world). The book is interesting and well-written. However, the author seems to be content with merely listing Richards supposed crimes; he fails to provide any sort of psychological profile. He also exaggerates a lot, for instance by stating that Richard was the worst tyrant that ever ruled England (what about Henry VIII???). The lack of proper references for numerous statements is also very irritating. Overall, a book worth reading for people interested in Richard III and the Wars of the Roses - although by no means the last word on this controversial subject."
1,Don't let this be the final word on Richard,"There is no more controversial subject in English history than the character and supposed crimes of Richard III. This book ultimately fails because it offers little support and the writer is not nearly objective eneough to be considered a serious historian. A historian needs to take into consideration any bias his sources may have, something Seward didn't do. All of his sources are Tudor or Lancastrian (his opponents in life), which are naturally hostile.I actually believe Richard did kill his nephews, though I also believe he has been slandered against too much and is accused of actions he had no part of. There is too much emotion on the subject, and it is difficult to have a real debate when there are unsubstantiated polemics on the subject such as this one."
3,too one sided,"This book is too one sided, and it reflects badly on the writer, rather than on the subject. As a trained historian, this book is hard to read because it is not even handed. Henry the VII would approve."
1,Not What It Should Be,I got a tube (almost empty) with a bit of greasy water in the bottom. If this was ever a paste it broke down a long time ago. Stay Away!
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this product before buying. When it arried, the tube was the size as shown but there is hardly any product in it. The product is watery, which is not good for a silicon grease. I tried in vain to mix this product for use and all was in vain. I returned this product for a full refund."
4,Good but.........,"Dynamic band with an interesting range of songs and statements. BUT I did not notice this CD had only 2 songs on it. Enjoyed it though would rather had more songs. Nina does a great job and their music video is very original, sort of a ""battle of the bands"" type of thing. Looks like both bands had fun with that one."
2,Better choices available,"If you want to learn modeling in teh IT/IS industry, you would be better served by going to another source. Rational is the ""King"" of UML modeling and their products are much better than this.Further, if you want support for more database platforms than only DB2, Oracle, or MS SQL then you will want to use a different tool. Try learning data modeling using tools from Computer Associates or Embarcadero before going anywhere near this horribly over-rated software."
2,Pretty basic,"My son loves Max, so I thought this would be cute to read to him in the weeks leading up to Halloween. There isn't much of a story here. Ruby's her typical self and holds all the candy from trick-or-treating so Max won't eat it all. Some characters sneak pieces of candy into Max's costume, but there's really nothing more to the story. My son gets a kick out of Max's shoe being full of candy. It's a really short story and in my opinion, it's not written very well."
5,Definitely worth a try,"I've been following Juniper Lane for a number of years now, and I definitely reccomend them. Their sound has changed a fair amount over the years, but this album was the one where they started to shine. Vivion's voice is great, and if you want an idea of what their cds are like just visit their website at [...]. I recommend their more current release Sirens From a Mile Back even more, and there are songs from that on their website. See why it won Washingtonian Magazine's Band of the Year award!"
1,alpha is not,"i will never buy an alpha product again. this is very poor quailty as are all the alphas i have bought. this is a good movie, but the picture is so poor it is not worth it.."
1,Unknown,I haven't seen this video. I'm hesitant because as a fan of Dick Francis' books I'm aware that David Cleveland was not in any of these three. His character appeared in Slay Ride. These three stories had star characters that varied widely - an artist - secret investigator - physicist and I can't imagine how they could all be rolled into one character in all three stories.
3,Be careful of vignetting,"The problem is that the Nikon 5400 has such a wide angle lens that vignetting is inevitable with this accessory. With only one filter screwed on there is just a little darkening in the corners; nothing really too bad. But with two filters screwed on the corners are completely black and rounded. Although it's a well built metal tube, it would've been nice if it came with a lans cap and a cap for the other end to keep dust out and protect your filters while you're not using them."
4,Good solution to keep your humidifier working,"Keeping up with a humidor is a real pain. If you do it right, you have to take everything out, rub it down with distilled water, soak up the inside pad and then put everything back in. Then repeat and rinse every few days or so because those cigars just soak it all up. My uncle turned me on to these crystal gels. He bought me one and I got two from Amazon. I put them in my humidor (~50 cigars) and it's going strong even after 2+ weeks at the ideal humidity / 70%.I refilled these bottles every 2-3 weeks with distilled water and it just keeps going. I highly recommend the purchase, it will definitely save you time!"
4,Works well,This is morereliable than the cheap flower foam based circular pucks you get a must have after you have seasoned your humidor
2,Not the best,I have two of these in my 50 cigar humidor and it is still only at 64% humidity. I even calibrated my hydrometer 3 times to make sure it is working correctly.
5,Great Product,I have 30 cigar humidifier with about 10 cigars in it at a time. I live in Vegas and was having trouble getting my humidity past 30% even though I was using distelled water just about every day. I used the Ci Gel and it worked wonders. It lasted 2 months before the beads got down to the last 25%. I have gone thru 4 jars and am very happy.In addition the product is not shipped thru Amazon but I have received every shipment in less than 5 days.
5,Does what it's supposed to,"Does what it is supposed to do, and at a fair price. Will buy again when and if needed. Fast shipment, good product."
2,Ehhhh..... Not to sure about this,I bought one of these a while ago to help steady the humidity in my humidor. Its not a big humidor so according to the info one should have sufficed. It helped keep my levels at a steady 50%. So I bought another one. The second one has been in my box for a week now and its raised the levels to a whopping 55%. I cannot get it to go any higher. Maybe its because both of the gels I received are not the same as the one pictured. Maybe I am doing something wrong. Normally I have really good results with things I buy on Amazon based on other reviews. But this is one of the first products with that I have ever been unhappy with. I guess its back to the old shot glass of water and sponges in my humidor for this guy.
5,Excellent Product!,"Excellent add-on product through Amazon. (So small and inexpensive they don't like to ship individually.) Instructions are limited and hard to read on jar, so just make sure to use distilled water, but just a touch to keep crystals wet. Too much will make them expand right out of the jar! Place in humidor and forget. Lasts ~3-4 month depending on size of humidor."
5,Cigar caddy,"As far as function works ok, seller or company put sticker on caddy once removed glue stays on If was graded for that would receive a lower rating but on caddy alone you get exactly what you paid for."
3,"OK, But...","Seemed to work just as stated. After the initial jar evaporated I refilled w/ distilled water (that was several weeks ago). Checked on the collection recently and noticed mold on several of the ""beads"" within the jar. I removed the affected beads, so hopefully no more get moldy. But surprised that this happened."
2,Worked good until mold formed.,Worked good for about 6 weeks until mold suddenly appeared. Removed it right away. Hopefully nothing it did not ruin anything.
2,eh not so much...,"The sender actually called to tell me they weren't able to send the advertised brand and when I asked about quality, they said ""well its basically the same thing"". I wouldn't recommend buying this particular item. It wasn't the right size, and it doesn't work quite as well as the brand advertised."
4,*Updated- it really works,"I have a 25 cigar humidor and struggle to maintain 70% humidity with this. I added a shot glass filled with water and it hit 70% in a few hrs and holds. I haven't tried it with just the shot glass yet, but the combo seems to work. I'll try to update after I try shot glass only and see if anything changes. Otherwise, I am not sure I can recommend this!*update9/18/2012So, I added a little more water and it held the humidity at 65%. it lasted several months. I no longer use the shot glass. I actually bought it again. Just make sure you add enough water . . . . and if the temp is not where you want it, add more water!!! works well and I'm happy."
2,Developed spotty mold,"I have 6 of spread across three other humidors, two per small humidor of about 40-75 cigars. Some bought through Amazon and at local shops. 3 of the 6 have developed mold within 1-3 months while others in the same humidor have not. I suspect that whomever supplies the gel crystals may have manufacturing variables. The crystals when hydrated allow the formation of mold due to the moisture levels. I've seen this also with some formulas with foam type inserts and PG solutions. The formation of mold came well down the road from being used however, as in years. I'll be going back to the foam types and the local laboratory supply for PG.Update:All have developed spotty mold within 6 months. The longevity of these is disappointing."
3,Just okay,"This item is nice for desktop humidors because you don't have to add the distilled water / alcohol mix to the conventional ones. You just take the cap off, drop it in there and add water once the beads get below the line. Too easy. The problem I have had with them is that if you live in a dry climate they will only bring humidity levels to about 40%. I would recommend going with two of them instead of just one."
3,OK,"This product is just OK. As you look at the many ways to keep cigars fresh and moist, this is probably the cheapest. Works great with a small collection in a humidor of a capacity of 20 or less. I tried this and it has not let me down, I feel that traditional humidifying systems work best. If you are in a hurry and need a cheap way of humidification then this is a good buy for that situation."
4,Works fine,Works just fine. Not sure it was worth buying though. Doesn't do much more than the stock humidifier that comes with most humidors though
5,Love it,If you're like me and often times go weeks without getting into your humidor you need this stuff. It lasts a long time and you don't have to worry about your good Cigars drying out. I use this stuff in a small humidor that holds about 20 cigars and it does a fantastic job of keeping the humidity right where I need it.
1,inadequate,"This product is simple enough. Open lid; put in humidor. I thought one would be sufficient for my 20 cigar humidor. Barely kept the humidity above 60%. Bought another, thinking that it might need two. No luck. 63% and steady. The basic humidifier square that comes with the humidor did a better job. Waste of money."
2,"As previously stated, wrong picture & not so great!","Upon receiving it looks nothing like the picture at all and I would be surprised if it weighs to be 2 oz. The case is made of really cheap plastic like one you would find in the quarter toy machines at your grocery store. Usually I use Humi-Care Crystal Cigar Gel (which is blue in color and 4oz that can last up to a year if re-filled approx once a month). The only reason I switched to this brand is for the added convenience of being a Prime User and the Free 2 day shipping. I gave it two stars only because it does seem to work somewhat, but still not as well as it's competitors. I believe my average reading was around 60% compared to the 75% I usually see with Humi-Care (And I have smaller 40 capacity Humidor). If your looking for a decent cigar gel I would recommend Humi-Care Crystal Cigar Gel which is twice as big at the same price. The only downside it is currently not being sold on Amazon but can be found on cigar stores online."
3,Arrived postage due,"Seems to be immediately helping the RH in my 25-cigar humidor, according to the hygrometer. My only complaint is that this item arrived via USPS and was ""postage due."" It's only 45 cents short, but an annoyance nonetheless."
1,Looks nothing like what I ordered.,"The picture of this item looks nothing like what I received. It came in a small plastic container with what appeared to be typed, while mailing labels on them- one on top of the other. The packaging saying nothing about ""Cigar Caddy,"" and just appears to be a bunch of mush in a plastic container. Trash."
1,Garbage,"I purchased this for a small humidor, and it simply does not work. A shot glass half-filled with distilled water kept my humidor at 70%, whereas the humidity fell to nearly 60% when using this gel. Moreover, there are NO INSTRUCTIONS included. I wasn't sure whether to keep the lid loosely on or off the jar, or whether to fill it with distilled water or propylene glycol. You're better off buying a jar of snake oil."
2,1987 Jeep Wrangler -DOES NOT FIT,"1987 Jeep Wrangler -DOES NOT FITAmazon's find parts says they fit, but they do not.I will cut them to fit but I expected ""custom fit"" as represented in the product's features.In this case I guess ""custom fit"" means that you will have to customize them to fit."
4,"2001 Toyota Corolla - Not great, Not Bad!","Shipping/Packaging: Perfect condition. Arrived earlier than expected.General Product Detail: I have a 2001 Toyota Corolla & these mats are not bad, not great, but still decent. They work better than the original carpeted mats which came with my car because they developed holes & were very dirty/discolored. These fit OK. Very easy to install with minor alterations, I had to do some cutting, but nothing over-the-top.Overall: This product works well. Husky has a good name & the product will last for a long time. They're easy to wash, just bring out your hose & spray them down; I always do this when washing my car. Recommend buying these. Another thing - you can't beat this price!"
3,Nice Mats-Not A Custom Fit,"Far from being a great fit, these are really just stock mats that fit well enough you don't have to cut them.Outstanding product quality, no so great fit for the VW Golf -- some left foot rest/mat overlap.OK for this set, but I will look for a better fit the next time."
4,"nice mats, OK fit for my vehicle",Very sturdy floor mats. The driver's side required more than basic trimming to clear the accelerator pedal for my 98 Outback (ie I needed to cut away part of the mat). I think the Husky floor *liners* would do a better job in truly messy conditions as these floor mats have let the elements through to soak my vehicle's carpet.
4,Easy read,This is a good handbook for anyone looking to gain insight into student affairs adminstration in higher education. The book is organized well and is easy to read and understand. Used this book for a graduate level class in Student Services and is a great resource to refer back to.

3,Just a thought.,"""Why didn't our grandparents and parents fall over dead from all these hazards?""Our grandparents didnt have to cope with all the chemicals we have today! They didnt get allergic, 1/3 of all americans are allergic today. In my book that is due to poison coming from products we have in our homes, combined with not enough ventilation.If you wrap the house in plastic and use buildingmaterial of formaldehyde inside it, whats going to happen? Myself I got allergic just a few years after moving into such a house, built 1974. Nowadays there are many more toxic stuff to breath in."
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"If you are ""between boyfriends"" or ever have been, you will most definitely recognize yourself in this book. Cindy is witty and honest that her track record in dating doesn't exactly qualify her as a dating expert. It's like the book says, she dates so you don't have to. I especially loved the section on relationship-reruns. Hello, how many times do we have to date the same man to see the GLARING RED FLAGS ALL AROUND HIM! Read it, you'll be glad you did."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am usually a very fast reader and this book was very difficult for me to sit down and read for any amount of time, no where near as witty as I hoped. There are a few lines that made me smile but for the most part the bookwas pointless and very unhelpful."
3,Entertaining Enough,"This book is great to share with your girlfriends. Cindy Chupack is clever and witty, and you will recognize some of her horror stories from Sex and the City. However, as much as I love the show, and as likeable as the author is, this collection of essays doesn't really stand out in the sea of post-feminist, single-gal-looking-for-love humor books. That said, if you love that genre, then this is a fine specimen. If you liked Chupack's columns in Glamour, then you will enjoy this book."
4,Excellent read for the single woman who wants a good laugh!,"I bought this book after my divorce as kind of a pick me up if you will. It isn't the book that is going to change your life but it will make you laugh and feel better about yourself and your situation. There were many laugh out loud moments and times where I could really relate to the author. There were also things I didn't relate to and found just ""ok"" some of the book is filler and somewhat boring but I believe the good parts make up for the bad. I recommend this to any single woman who is kind of down about her situation to make her laugh and feel better!"
5,Fantastic,"I bought this book after a difficult breakup after having read multiple other books. This isn't a book that is going to ""teach"" you how to get through a bad breakup but it definitely gave me a much needed laugh. I felt comforted when I found myself recognizing some of the situations and seeing it wasn't just me. I have recommended this book to many of my friends regardless of their relationship status."
5,Loved It-Therapy for the Single's Soul,"I was given this book as a present from my sister. I have to say I absolutely loved it! Every Chapter is both funny and emotional. I could relate to alot of what the author wrote. For a person who has always been ""in between boyfriends"", this book provides hope, laughter and at sometimes therapy for a broken heart. I purchased 3 of these books for my cousins and gave it to them for Christmas."
3,A bit brainless,"Funny and entertaining! The majority of young women can relate to several of the topics and stories in this book. A humorous and sarcastic look at dating and life in a woman's twenties and thirties. A bit empty, and not necessarily worth paying hardcover price for, it's a pretty fluffy 150 pages. I got this book for almost free, and I found it enjoyable.This book was okay, but I HIGHLY recommend checking out The Thrill of the Chaste by Dawn Eden. Eden's book is also very funny and insightful. Check out the reviews and give it a read. I found it to have much more to offer than The Between Boyfriends Book."
2,Not So Fabulous,"I purchased this at friend's urging as we were both avid S&TC fans. This book was a disappointment overall. There were some clever plays on words ('hey baby weight') & observations just as you'd expect if you watch S&TC but this book wasn't anywhere near as funny or insightful. A lot of the 'episodes' in this book made the writer seem bitter and intolerant of the life choices of others. Witty at times but a little too sarcastic for my tatse and the chapters were dragged out & way tooooooooooooooo long. Note to the author, the show is only a half an hour & that's what makes it work..."
5,Excellent for Those Seeking Biblical Applications to Counsel,"This workbook is excellent for those who like to put Biblical applications into their counseling. The workbook allows different categories of problems and questions to be answered concerning these problems in an interactive way. At the end of each section, there is a short summary regarding the answers to the questions. I have found that this workbook also makes an EXCELLENT devotional guide!"
5,Best first novel I've read,"I read Private Heat on a friend's recommendation and I'm glad I did. The book is well plotted, moves quickly, and is, quite frankly, hard to put down. I read several first novels each year, and an author's lack of experience is usually easy to spot. Not so in this case. The protagonist is believable (imagine, a private eye with a family instead of a harem). The bad guys are believable (a carefully constructed scam). The supporting characters are believable. The action quickly moves from one believable situation to the next. A good novel creates the willing suspension of disbelief, and this book does just that. I look forward to Robert Bailey's next novel, as Private Heat will surely lead to a string of successes."
3,Pretty good...,"I heard about this guy on Planet Out... and decided to check him out. :-) It's good... especially if you like sexy Savage Garden-esque gay thumpa-thumpa... yum.The ballads kind of suck, though... the lyrics are corny and the melodies are kind of cringe-worthy cheesy... somebody probably told him he had to throw a couple of them in there. :-)Overall, worth it."
3,It's Ok,"I found this CD to be just average. Sure the subject of a openly gay pop star is great in my opinion, but this is not a great CD. The songs are all very amateur sounding and cheaply recorded. The beats are mild, the lyrics are on and off, sometimes being sexy and sometimes being just plain silly, and his voice is just not all that great. Just because this CD is about being gay openly does not mean it's a great CD. The recordings themselves are very poorly made and sound almost like they did it for fun in someones house one saterday afternoon. I'm not saying the CD is horrible, but it's not great either. The only song worth listening too is ""you turn it on""."
5,Solid Excitement,"JV has produced an excellent CD which showcases his range and maturity since American Idol. Collaborating with Gabe Lopez was the best thing to happen to him. The variety is great, the intensity fine, and you just have to dance! This is a great driving CD, and will stand up to any party. Highly recommended."
4,chaos princess,"This guy is hot, and has a voice that just sizzles. Not bad at all for a first cd. Who needs Amercian Idol."
5,This CD is a must have.,"The CD opens up with the hot track Move. The track You turn it on, is a hot track that would be perfect for the club or for a drive around town. Hold On is a soft ballad that really shows Verraros's voice. Jim's CD is a variety of moods, beats, ballads, club, and rock. ""Welcome to Hollywood"" and ""Outside"" show a more alternative rock side to Verraros. Jim Verraros sounds like a young George Michael with a hot new style. A must buy!"
4,Leather case for Zire 72,Nice product. Feels like a wallet with my Zire 72inserted into it.I now can carry my Zire as if its a wallet insteadof having it with no protection or that hardmetal case.The case is not too soft but not as hard as metal.it is like stiff leather and works well in mypocketbook or back pocket.thank you
3,"Varied essays; Some good, some dull and PC","Some chapters are better than others. Several are good but many are written like the required reading for one of those required ""diversity"" courses in college. Those essays (about half the book) don't get into any practical information about law school, but instead focus on things like feminism, race, sexual orientation and how that relates to law, learning, or the typical student experience. Other chapters have interesting information and have good insight about subjects taught (Torts, Civil Procedure, etc.)."
1,"DON""T BOTHER",I have tried to order this product twice and it has been cancelled twice. Don't waste your time....
5,The Work of Wolves,"This novel is a great read, full of inner thoughts of the major characters (a wonderful mix of characters they are),complete with flashbacks to moments of significant relevancy to the present. This is the story of a strong-willed teenager clashing with a bull-headed and ruthless rancher who never gives up exacting revenge on the kid for beating him at his own game of taking advantage of people.Carson Fielding's love for his grandfather; Earl Walks Alone's rather silent but all-wise grandmother; Willi, the German exchange student's fascination with his unreconstructed Nazi grandmother, all illustrate the power of the grandparent in the lives of children.Without giving away the plot ( which many reviewers have already done), The title, ""The Work of Wolves,"" comes from several instances where the antagonist, Magnus Yarborough, isolates his intended victim and then strikes.""The Work of Wolves"" is a psychologica novel, a story of redemption, and a must read."
5,"Loved it so much, I found all the rest, did a room w/BH mice","Made displays to match the illustrations, now doing a closet mural with the picnic and poppies babies. Now collecting all information and dishes, figurines to go with it. I made a 33"" high fake tree to match the house. Even have little mice inside. Have entire guest room to display them."
4,Only one? Well one is what it says!,"The picture of TWO ignitors got me hoodwinked into thinking I would be getting 2. But if you read what it says and don't just look at what you see, any dumbie would know there was only one!I have not used it long enough to know how well it will hold up, but it did work when I installed it.It is not a product made on the highest quality machine or with the best ever materials. But the price was good and the product worked for me. I am happy with the selection. I only wish the picture was of the number that are being offered (one) and not be surprised that there are not two when the order arrives."
5,The BEST introductory module written for Dungeons & Dragons,"There is not a single module for Dungeons and Dragons that is crafted as well as this one. The story behind the module is very deep and inticing. All of the traps, pitfalls and placement of creatures is extremely well thought out and explained in detail. The journal entries is a nice touch too, enabling the gamemaster to better understand the mechanisms, and giving room for enhancement. The encounters are perfectly balanced and everything makes sense. The included map is perfect for 25mm scale miniatures!I have run this adventure twice now, and it had been received warmly both times. This adventure is particularly useful for setting up a homebase for first time adventurers.If you enjoy this module, I also highly recommend the three boxed modules: The Haunted Tower, The Dragons Den and the Goblin's Lair."
1,This review is not written by a friend / family member of the author,65 reviews all giving 5 stars. The author sure has a lot of friends. I don't know about readers though - good luck getting through it if you fell for the unanaimous praise. It is garbage.
5,cemetery fence,"Cemetery fence.Another beauty. I really enjoyed this one. Without giving away too much, I would like to mention the small connections to ""sheep"" that were so cleverly thrown in. Although the two stories are completely separate, the small connections show uniqueness to this writer's style. I hope to see at least one of the two stories become a movie.This book made my Christmas and Hanukah shopping easier."
5,Way to go&#65533;&#65533;,Mysterious and wild. Supernatural and Unknown. Romantic and Fulfilling. Action and Adventure. This one has it all... A fun journey to take a back seat and watch unfold. So many parts to talk about with fellow readers. Very fine job. : Mary
5,creative,"This one is a very creative piece of work.It begins with the story of a young boys life and all of a sudden he realizes he has a certain type of gift.This gift raises interests and some anger around the storyline.I really enjoyed the sub-stories surrounding the main event.What a clever way to put it all together.Very touching, it makes you think of passed loved ones.I give it five stars."
5,SPOOKY,"THE BOOK SPOOKED ME OUT. YOU DON'T WANT TO READ CERTAIN PARTS WHEN YOU ARE HOME ALONE AT NIGHT. EVEN A TOUGH GUY LIKE MYSELF HAS LIMITS. SOME ADVICE THOUGH, GET YOUR WOMAN TO READ IT BEFORE BED, I DID, SHE DIDN'T LET GO OF ME ALL NIGHT. I HAVE TO THANK THE WRITER FOR THAT. NOW EVERYTIME I FEEL LIKE GETTING CLOSE, BEFORE BED I SAY, HONEY, THE CEMETERY FENCE. IT WORKS EVERY TIME. SERIOUSLY, THIS IS ONE HELL OF A STORY. I HOPE TO SEE IT BECOME A MOVIE. BEST SELLER MATERIAL."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK","I can't believe this is even on the market. I have a basic working knowledge of photo related software and this is terrible. When you import a family photo, it does not automatically keep its original proportions. I've never seen such a thing in ANY program anywhere. Everything loads slowly and the basics of creating a page from scratch have completely eluded me. When choosing a template, it does not tell you if it is 12x12 or 8.5x11. Every time one wants to add another photo from his file, the program makes you go through the whole steps from desktop to the file to find it; it doesn't stay in the file you are working from. One can't choose a background from one's own photos and the list goes on. I'm just amazed--they must have been smoking legalized marijuana in CA while designing this thing....Fortunately I only paid a couple dollars for it--don't waste the money."
5,great book,excellent for consolidating your free thinking business ideas. i especially liked the section about finding your e-type...
1,Very used,"I purchased a used book and believe me it was well used. Almost every page was written on and very distracting It should not have been sold, maybe given away."
3,STOP RIGHT THERE,It's not a bad CD but most of the songs I was looking for weren't on it. Check for the songs your looking for first !!!
2,Not the Samw!,i was disappointed honestly. I saw the movie and while watching it thought to myself WOW i have to get the soundtrack....SO many good songs. but now i looked at the song listing and most of the good songs fromt he movie arent even on it unfortunatly.
3,Am I the only one who feels something is missing?,"I was so excited to buy this CD after I saw the movie. My friend bought it, and I borrowed it. I really liked the remake of Smooth Criminal by Alien Ant Farm from the movie. I was SO disappointed to find out that this song was not included in the soundtrack, despite the fact that practically the whole song is played in the movie, and in a very funny scene. I don't plan on buying this CD now. The rest is just ok, and the reason for the 3 stars."
3,what about Laid by James??,"I thought the song Laid by the group James would be on there! That's the reason i was going to buy it, but maybe not now..."
4,"Great Movie, Okay soundtrack","The soundtrack overall is really good, its a good compilation of teenage music and is always fun to listen to on a roadtrip and whatnot, the only problem i have with this cd is that a lot of the music in the movie isn't on the cd. Can anyone tell me what the song is that they play throughout the movie but most importantly at the very end after the party is over and its the next morning and Kevin and Vicky are sitting at the table with the scrap book and Stiflers little brother is walking out with the XXX movies in his hand, and then it shows everyone that slept with eachother in bed (Jim,Michelle/Stifler,Lesbos/Oz,Heather) if anyone knows this song right a review for the cd and leave the answer in ur review thankyou very much"
2,Not as Good as the First,"I loved both the American Pie 1 and the American Wedding soundtrack. I was disappointed with this one, as it didn't seem to have the mood the other two did. It's decent, but not repeat-worthy."
3,Songs MIA,"I know that Blink 182, 3 Doors Down, and GreenDay had songs in the movie that did not appear on the soundtrack. Does anyone know the names of the songs???!!!This soundtrack is good......hopefully a second will be released showcasing the real soundtrack music."
3,The music in the movie was better...,"After watching American Pie 2, I rushed out to get the soundtrack only to find that some of the best songs, were not even on there (Alien Ant Farm's Smooth Criminal and New Found Glory). This was a big disapointment, but I decided to get the cd anyway. I wasn't too please, but some of the songs are pretty good (Blink-182 and Three Doors Down). Hopefully, there will be a follow-up soundtrack that includes all the awesome music that was in the movie."
1,Hey Natalie--Does this song remind you of...,"Hey Natalie--Does this song remind you of the song ""Stranded"" by the group Plumb with the lead singer who is Tiffany Arbuckle? The song ""Stranded"" was featured on the ""Drive Me Crazy"" movie soundtrack--the movie that starred Melissa Joan Hart. Anyway, the TUNES for the VERSES for ""Everywhere"" and ""Stranded"" sound almost identical. The ""Stranded"" song starts out: You know it only breaks my heart/To see you standin' in the dark/Oh Ohh you're waiting there for me/To come back/You're to afraid to show...then starts with the chorus. If I'm right let me know. Hope this helps."
1,Don't Buy this unless you're sure,"Today I went to see American Pie 2 and kinda liked the music. So I came home and looked up the soundtrack. After listening to all the samples, both songs that I especially liked from the movie weren't even on the soundtrack (and I'm sure songs not in the movie were) What's with that? It's supposed to be a soundtrack! How misleading. I'm glad I sampled before buying it...This CD is just another cliche teenybopper movie soundtrack."
4,Good,"Awesome soundtrack. I would give it five stars if it included the New Found Glory and American Hi-Fi's ""Flavor of the Week"" that were in the movie. Best movie soundtrack in a while nonetheless."
4,"Great Soundtack, but Slightly Disappointing","For the most part I enjoyed this movie and the soundtrack, but I'm dissapointed that they did not include Alien Ant Farm's cover of Michael Jackson's ""Smooth Criminal,"" the song from the newly infamous American Pie 2 adult video-and-glue scene. Other than this fallback, the soundtrack is great and very fitting to the movie."
3,Good But Not Great,"When I saw American Pie 2, some songs that I heard became my favorites. After seeing the movie I wanted to buy the soundtrack but these songs were not on it. Some of the missing songs are In Too Deep - Sum 41, Everywhere - Michelle Branch, Hit or Miss - A New Found Glory, Mrs. Robinson - Simon and Garfinkel, and Want You Bad - The Offspring. Some songs on the Cd are great but without these songs, I don't think I will be buying the CD. They should make another American Pie 2 soundtrack with all of the songs on it that they left off the first one."
4,"Initially disappointing, but has some hidden treasures","The reason i bought this CD was that i thought it would contain some of the more recognizable toons' from the movie (everywhere, in too deep, smooth criminal, want you bad, etc.). Imagine my surprise when i discovered that these recognizable songs were replaced by lesser known tracks. However, many of these cuts are big winners ( ie Halo, ALways Gettin Over You, Susan). the best song on the album is the hopped up ""Phoebe Cates"". Mark my words: Fenix* TX is gonna be the next blink-182!"
3,Hate it when preview song ISN'T in movie!,"I am a fan of James, and was really dissapointed to find that their song, Laid, wasn't actually in the movie (only in the previews)."
5,"Good music from the movie, but not all there..","Great music, but where is New Found Glory's ""Hit or Miss"", or The Offspring's ""Want You Bad""...there are probably other songs that I forgot that they had in the movie but not in the soundtrack.. Oh well...still good stuff."
3,???,hi! i am from austria. the movie american pie 2 isn't in the movie theatres yet here .... i am really looking forward to seeing it in some months. i've seen part one about 7 times (i've even have the english and german version on video). now my question: you all say that the new soundtrack isn't really good. would you be so kind and tell me the real good tracks which are not on the cd? thank you very much. tessi
1,Why even bother with a soundtrack!?,"This movie was full of great songs, but most of them aren't even on the soundtrack! Why bother even producing a soundtrack if the best and most obvious songs from the movie aren't going to be on it!? Oh...and for the earlier reviewer, the song you're looking for is ""Everything To Me,"" by Michelle Branch. You can find it on her recently released soundtrack."
3,I know the song you were looking for,"The song that someone mentioned earlier that says, ""You're everywhere to me / And when I close my eyes, it's you I see"" is ""Everywhere"" by Michelle Branch and it's on her new CD, The Spirit Room."
4,Good soundtrack but incomplete.,"Here's a list of songs I've gathered that are in the movie but not in the soundtrack, hope it helps someone (I can't promise that all of these songs are in the movie, it's just what I read, and I can't promise these are all the other songs from the movie either): Michelle Branch - Everywhere; The Offspring - Want You Bad; Sum 41 - In Too Deep (at end of movie when they're partying); Alien Ant Farm - Smooth Criminal; Afghan Whigs - Something Hot; American Hi-Fi - Flavor Of The Week; Weezer - Hash Pipe; New Found Glory - Hit Or Miss; Toilet Boys - Another Day in the Life; Ali Dee - In & Out"
4,Not the soundtrack!!,"I saw American Pie 2 and the songs in the movie are not the ones on the soundtrack. Songs like Alien Ant Farm - Criminal, American Hi-Fi - Flavour Of The Week & A New Found Glory - Hit Or Miss were in the movie, but are not on the soundtrack. So this might be a good CD. BUT IT IS NOT THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THE MOVIE!!!!!"
3,What happened to WEEZER?,"Okay, like everyone, I saw the movie and loved the music. I checked out the CD and was very very upset when I found out that the five songs I loved, weren't even on the soundtrack!! I mean, what happened to Weezer's ""Hash Pipe"", Alien Ant Farm's ""Smooth Criminal"", New Found Glory's ""Hit or Miss"", Offspring's ""Want You Bad"", and Michelle Branch's ""Everywhere""?? Being a fan of punk/rock music, I bought the CD anyway. I absolutely love Angela Ammons' ""Always Getting Over You"" and American HI-FI's ""Vertigo"". I give this CD 3 stars simply because the best songs that were played in the movie are missing and the songs they chose, were irrelevant and not remembered in the film."
2,Thank God I didnt buy this soundtrack!,"Omygosh I came out of the theater with my mind set on buying the soundtrack to this movie, I loved all the songs by AAF, Michelle Branch, Weezer, the Offspring, and more. I am soo dissapointed that these songs were not on the soundtrack and am relieved that I looked up the songs which songs were included before buying this cd. I dont understand why they play the songs in the movie but dont include them in the soundtrack!!!"
2,Remember when soundtracks had songs from the MOVIE?!,"So, I loved the movie and actually paid to see it twice. The songs in the movie are really full of energy. The music was a perfect blend of laughter, sobriety, and just going crazy. A great summary of the movie. Why, then, when I listen to the soundtrack, does it not remind me of the movie? It's just not a feel-good compilation of what American Pie 2 really was, and will just serve to disappoint loyal fans and would-be buyers of the soundtrack. Your time and money would be better spent seeing the movie again and remembering which songs you'd like to hear on your own version of an American Pie 2 soundtrack."
3,Smooth Criminal!,"i dont have this cd, but im just telling that other guy that the ""hard song"" that wasnt included on the cd is ""smooth criminal"" by alien ant farm....u should buy their cd if u like that song"
2,not what I really wanted,"I really enjoyed the music in the movie when I went to see it. In this age of file sharing and mp3 downloading, if I only like one or two songs in a film, I'll download them rather than buying the soundtrack. But I enjoyed the music in the movie so much that I figured the whole soundtrack would be great and would capture the fun...so I ran out and bought it.I was sorely disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there are a few gems on here...a couple good bands. But if I'm not mistaken, there are a lot of songs that were in the movie that AREN'T on this soundtrack...and I am not crazy about most of it. I'd recommend just watching the movie again over buying this CD..."
4,AP2 Rocked!,"I loved the movie and the soundtrack is awesome but I really want to know the name of the song when they came together at the band camp. When she was playing the flute and he came on to the stage. It was kinda slower, if anyone knows could you please tell me!!"
3,"Good, but not great","I really did like this CD. I saw the movie and immediatelly bought it after. Unfortunately, as many know there are many important songs from the movie that do not feature on the CD, which is quite annoying... And By the way, can someone tell me what is the first song playing during the credits (this time it's gonna be the last time...). Thanx a lot if you can help me on that one."
3,I won't buy this sound track,"One star for Blink 182, one star for Green Day, and one for Sum 41. I love these bands and I'll buy THEIR C.DS Because except for the three songs that they play, the rest ...[stinks.] I hoped Weezer would be on this cd <sigh>"
2,It's a pitty,"definitely missing the best songs in the movie... too bad because it could have been an awesome album, like american pie 1."
4,Stop!,"I feel bad just typing this in because I'm doing the same thing you are but don't ask ""what song was that?"" or even answer them. It screws up the average album rating and is really a pain if somebody is actually trying to read a review. If it really bugs you that much, email the people who have already rated it or check the movie's website, I don't know."
2,why????,Why the hell is Michelle Branch not on this soundtrack???? it is the best song in the entire movie along with Blink and Sum41. I would like to see a second soundtrack released for the songs that were missed off the album but are just as good. pity.
3,My cd review,"Hey! I bought the cd the day before i saw the movie in theaters. When i came back home i was happy to have the soundtrack but then i realized some of the best songs in the movie weren't in the soundtrack. .. I think they should make a second soundtrack.. like ""more music from ap2""..."
3,"Some good songs, but buyers are dodged","Can someone post the name of the song that is played at the end of the movie on the credits screen?A section of it goes something like ""I'm a lover, i'm a sinner, i'm a fighter"""
3,Not too bad... worth owning...,"Alright, so I do like the CD. I have to say that it's not bad, quite enjoyable actually. It has a nice mix of music on it. My biggest disappointment on it, however, is that the BEST song played during the entire movie was somehow left off of the soundtrack. For the life of me I can't remember the name or artist, but it's one of the hardest songs played, and definitely one of the catchiest. Anyway, if anyone knows, i'd love to find out. But that was the only problem with the soundtrack."
1,What a load of CRAP!!!!,"Just got out of the movie (which is really [...] funny, rivals the first one at least) and was really excited to go out right away and buy the soundtrack. I assume a lot of others will have the same feeling. WATCH OUT!!! Two of the songs which are prominent in the movie are NOT on this soundtrack. The label has put some of the artists you hear in the movie (Alien Ant Farm, 3 Doors Down) but put different songs on the soundtrack than are in the movie. I understand that what they're doing is forcing you to buy the artists entire CD, nice [....] Might still be a great soundtrack (the artists are all great), just beware that what you're buying is not exactly what you heard in the movie."
2,missing,"This soundtrack is definitely missing some great music from the movie....Michelle Branch, Offspring, etc. This is a big disappointment to the fans of the movie. This soundtrack is definitely thumbs down in my book."
3,Missing and unkown song,"I'm sure a lot of you can help me out on one of the missing songs that should be on the soundtrack. What is the name of the name of the song towards the end of the movie? It plays right after the party while everyone is sleeping (plays after sum 41 ""In too deep."") Someone please help me out!"
2,Stifler's Mom's theme,"Guess I'm too old for this music (my young adult kids love it). However, I thought the movie was pretty funny. What I want to know is--does anyone know the name of the blues/jazz music theme that was played when Stifler's Mom showed up? It's also at the very, very end of the movie credits. Thank you!"
3,NAME OF SONG?,whats the name of the song that was playing in the movie when michelle and jim get together at the concert near the end? i really wanna know which one it is
3,NEED HELP FOR THE NAME OF SONG/ARTIST,"please... I really need to know the song name that is played at the near end, immediately right AFTER sum 41's In Too Deep, it is played while they show the different couples on different bedsthanks"
5,"Rich, sensuous, amazing!","I am dazzled by the richness in the music. It reminds me of an aural hand woven Oriental rug. I don't know if I'll ever be able to dance to the lovely songs, but I love listening to them and undulating to them. It's truly beautiful."
2,Not for dancers,I always hope for good bellydance music when I buy a new CD. While this album provides some easy listening (if there is such a thing in this genre) it does not provide good dance music. I gave it to my instructor to listen to and she agrees. I guess it depends on your expectations.
4,Songs from the movie missing,"I thought this was a very good soundtrak. My favorite songs are numbers 2,5,6,9,10,14 and 17. There are some good songs left out. I bought this soundtrak thinking that they would be on there but were not. The song that played after Allen's mother got mugged in the back alley. The song that played before they entered the club and the song that played after antonio shot his father. All three were good songs, that for some reason or another got left out. If any has information about these songs plesase write a review to this soundtrak and let me know in your review. Thanks!"
3,A Different Kind of Mystery titled Another Kind of Monday,"First of all, I was required to read this book for English Festival and did not choose to read it. Overall,it was a pretty good book, but I definitely would not recommend it to any one under 13. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I completely did not understand it and it didn't fit in with the rest of the book at all. It was very educational, though. I live in Pittsburgh and, while discuccing this book in class, discovered that our class took a field trip to an observatory and looked through a Brashear lense! Before this, the only one of the historical people in this book I had heard of was Henry Clay Frick, and I didn't even really know who he was! This book is good for any one who likes mysteries or historical books."
2,"Good story, bad ending!","This was a very intriguing book. I was captivated until the last few pages, in which the author managed to throw his entire story down the drain. Read the book, but put it down before last chapter. I was thoroughly disappointed."
2,"Started ok, but ending left me disappointed.","As a Young Adult librarian, I read this book thinking I could recommend it to my readers if I liked it. I really liked the 1st half of the book, a real page-turner. The whole tie-in with the story of Great Expectations is wonderful, and the idea of a ""quest"" sounded fun. I even managed to smile at the references to the nasty, unhelpful ""librarian"" working at the ""Circulation Desk"" - most of us that have set foot in a (largish) public libary know that librarians do not work at Circulation Desks anyway, so I tried not to take it personally. Towards the end of the story, I had really lost a lot of interest in the ""quest"", and in the characters as well. I was waiting for a climax, but there was none. I thought the ending was totally ...well, boring actually. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I still can't figure out if going on this quest (risking their life, really) was worth it to the main characters,in the end. I don't think so."
4,A taste of history,"I found this book to be very exciting. As a Pittsburgh native, the vivid descriptions and the awesome facts about the city really peaked my interest. Mark was an interesting thoughtful young man that wasn't sure where he was going until he met and feel in love with Zeena. I was disappointed, however, that Zeena stayed so angry throughout the book, but I tried to understand her viewpoint. Also, I would have liked to have seen what happened with Mark and his father, but overall the book was a good read."
2,A Weird Wild Goose Chase,"I had a difficult time getting through this book, but I pluggedon hoping things would get better. They didn't! The protagonist gotinvolved in a quest based on local history, but the clues were too specific to locale to make it intriguing for the reader. The book went on too long and ended very flat."
2,Not Exactly a Pageturner,"On a scale of 1-10, I would give this book a 3.5 It had potential to be a great book, but it seemed like the author was writing it for an adult to read instead of a kid. There were a lot of holes left unfilled such as who was sending them on the quest, what happened between Mark and Zeena, and what happend between Mark and his mom. I didn't like the fact that Mark completely ignored Merial after he started the quest. It made me dislike his character a lot. This book was worse that washing the car. I definitely wouldn't recommend Another Kind of Monday for someone who likes action books."
4,Amethyst is my daughter's Favorite Troll,"I bought this doll for my daughter about 2 weeks ago. It is so cute, and my daughter just adores it. She loves to play with the hair and change the dolls outfits constantly. It reminds me of the trolls I had growing up except that this one is much ""cooler."" I think it's also a bit more wholesome than other dolls on the market but it is still just as fashionable... Overall, a great doll that I am thrilled I bought for my daughter."
4,ok for girls who liked bratz and my scene,"Trollz dolls are an ok product. It probably isnt for a girl like me but im sure it would be great for other girls with differant likes/dislikes. Their for girls who dont like bratz but strawberry shortcake is too girly. I ratead the the durability a 2 though because the hair falls out when brushed and sometimes the head even pops off! Oh and Johnny Loo Bunitorisua is very wrong about his opinion on girls. He should be reported! I think hes a scam because I saw that SAME report word for word on another doll but he said his name was ""Mary Ann"""
1,A worthless purchase,"I bought XAM CSET GeoScience hoping for something equivalent to Barron's or Princeton Review's practice exams for the SAT or GRE, something to test where I might have a weakness in college level competency in the Earth sciences. What I got for $35, was a thin, 76 page booklet of what might be called Cliff Notes for a 6-8th grade Earth science textbook. There is a 115 question practice test which doesn't approach the level of the sample questions one can download from the CSET website. This booklet is absolutely worthless for preparation for the CSET exam."
2,Doesn't keep my 50 cigar box above 60%.,"I had the sponge type and it worked until it started leaking. I was at 72% most of the time according to my Caliber 3 digital hygrometer. I bought this to replace it. Doesn't keep it even above 60%. So I guess these are hit and miss. I even sponged it down one more time after this didn't work, still doesn't work properly. Also this product is not a Madelaine product it is made by IQ which is the same brand as the one that started leaking."
2,Indian Motorcyle,"While the motorcyle is cute, it is pretty small. My son just turned 3 and it is almost too small for him. It also doesn't move very fast at all. Much slower than a Barbie car or something like that. My son pushes on the ground to go faster. In my opinion, it would be good for a 2 year old, but maybe not much older."
3,Very cute,"Although amazon stated it's maximum weight up to 100 lbs, the manual states otherwise.. 52 lbs!Now that my son has it, I cannot return it because he is in love with it. He says it is his favorite Birthday present EVER.I would have given a higher overall rating if the motorcycle would have been as shown. If your child fits the weight limitations, I definitely recommend this item. It is easy to put together, and my little motorcycle fanatic thinks it is the real thing.The headlight is pretty neat. I don't recommend using it in the dark, but driving in the shadows and behind the sofa in the evenings is a blast for him. The ability to go forward and backward is definitely another fun function.Durability: So far so good with no broken mirrors or plastic off the top/front/sides. After charging the initial 10 hours over night, it was dead again by the end of the day. My son used it a lot. Since then we have had to charge it again several times, about once every 2 days."
3,problems,"Goes together well but unfortunately the screws were not sent for the handlebars and when I called Kaylee toys to ask for replacements they could not figure out what size screws these were and if they could find them it would take 4-6 weeks so would not have been in time for Xmas. So heads up that this company does not cover their warantee at all. Not even pleasant on the phone, disconnected once. I am not about to send it back as the time and money is not worth returning it. They suggested I go find screws locally but could not tell me what size screw to purchase so wasted a lot of time, Overall a cute product but don't believe Kaylee is going to honor your warantee. Heads up!"
3,Missing Manual-Help!,My son received this from my Father for Christmas. My little one was a bit to small for it then--now that he can ride it I can't figure out how to recharge the BATTERY! I am sure SOMEWHERE in this house is a manual but heavens knows where it could be... if anyone could email a copy or explain how to recharge you would be the HERO for a little 2yr old little boy! [...]Thanks!!!!
4,Motorcycle,We bought this for our grandson and had it shipped directly to his home. He has been riding it everyday and it is standing up well to the punishment a little boy can dish out. In the pictures we have seen it looks very much like the catalog picture and our daughter says it is his favorite toy.
4,great buy from a good company,"the motorcycle is very cute and my son has a great time riding it up and down the block. i ordered the bike a week before my son's 3rd birthday. said that it would take an extra 2-3 days to ship. worried that it wouldn't be here in time, i called Best in Home and asked if there was any way it could be shipped out faster. the gentleman told me that he would flag the order for immediate processing, but no guarantees. he was very helpful and caring. and, on top of that, he checked up on things to see if my order made it in time. this was the most positive customer service experience i've had in a very long time. thanks BEST IN HOME!!!"
5,MILES OF SMILES,"The product is easy to assemble and can hold it's own at a 2 year old's birthday party. Sharing is a new concept to her, but she managed it in stride. So far the only complaint comes from the parents who have been waiting, not to patiently, for the battery to die so they can make her take a break from it. The shipping took alot of the box, but the bike made it with only minor scuffs on the headlight. Overall a sturdy bike, minor tipping when trying to turn at too sharp of an angle and the noise level overall is acceptable to adults."
4,A nice little bike,"My daughter was very happy when she got this for Christmas. She's short for almost 3 and still had no trouble climbing on. The noisemaker horn is annoying to me inside but doesn't seem so loud outside. It was relatively easy to put together (3 steps) and comes with it's own charger. She seemed to have no trouble working the controls. IT WILL, however, tip easily despite the training wheels. She fell right over on mildly uneven ground. We haven't tested it on gravel yet but I doubt it has the traction to work there (the wheels are bald hard plastic). All and all I think it's an excellent toy as long as you have plenty of hard surface to ride it on."
2,Healing by Design,"This book is okay. The information presented seems to be in line with other Natural Health Books I have read. If you are an avid reader you understand that sometimes one bit of information you did not know is worth reading a whole book. Youcan always learn something new. But,this not a comprehensive book --doesn't provide enough specific information if you are looking for in-depth healthsolutions. It is a good overview for beginners. For my money,Dr. Don Colbert is just about as good as you can get."
4,Healing By Design,This was a very interesting book. It made me think about my diet!!! The final part became a bit boring.
2,Disappointed,"After hearing Dr. Hannen discuss his book on TBN TV, I purchased a copy with the hopes that it would provide some new insight into natural healing remedies. I found the book good at detailing the causes for specific diseases but it fails when it comes to providing the same level of specificity for the remediation of the diseases he describes. The good Doctor also seems contradictory when he lauds the body's ability to heal itself only to sound like an apologist for the AMA at other times by describing certain diseases as irreversible. Where's your faith Doc? The general solutions listed in the Health Protocols section of the book serve an a vehicle to hawk the author's proprietary products - obviously self serving. There are folks who can provide far greater knowledge of the body's ability to heal itself than what's found in this book - Roger Mason comes to mind."
3,Great Story Ideas,"Some of them aren't carried out that well, though.Be My Valentine could have been more interesting - the premise was really great, but the author seemed to feel that she had to turn Lucky into such a bad guy that he wouldn't have done what he'd done in the first place - to allow her characters to get together. It's like she had a great idea but then just dumped it. Might have been better if she'd had Lucky find God and then be in the next romance with Jackie.At times, her female characters are really dense and unreasonable and you want to yell at them.There was a bit of sexism - no reason a Christian story has to have it - but I was bugged by a couple of times where the narrative went - ""the women did as they were told.""Also the frequent ""that (whatever) of yours"" - is that a common way of speech in Alaska - it sounds so extremely corny."
4,Ninja Warriors,This was a good game but could have been better if there were multiple players and a longer storyline. They need to make games like this for playstation 3.
5,Excellent detailed book on alcoholism,"This book goes into more depth on alcoholism than any other I have found. This recent edition also includes information on other drugs. For a nuanced discussion of causation, disease concept, family effects, this is the book to buy."
2,Mahogany?,"The piece of wood that I received was indeed quarter sawn. Beyond that I was very disappointed in the product. I have ordered the same before and been very happy with the piece of genuine mahogany I received. However, this was, as best as I can ascertain, Philippine mahogany which is a misnomer. Philippine mahogany is actually not even in the mahogany family. Most of us know it as ""luan"". I emailed the company and asked for a response. Nothing!!"
4,This is available at Best Buy,"I saw most of the episodes for this series on ESPN...They were EXCELLENT! Also, you can buy this set @ Best Buy for $74.99"
4,Well made sports movies.,"Not a huge ESPN fan, but these 30 for 30 movies are well made. Sometimes over dramatic, but good for any sports fans."
1,It doesn't work!,I have a blue ray player that does not accept the disks!I just recently tried unsuccessfully to play it.
1,Not as described......,"The ESPN 30 for 30 Collector's Set Blu Ray [Blu-Ray] (2011) is not the same as the ""Limited Edition Collector Set"" in the DVD format as described in the Editorial Reviews of both products. The Editorial Reviews for both are verbatim the exact same. I had purchased the Limited Edition Collector Set in the DVD format as a gift for my son. A couple of days after I had received the item, I received an e-mail from Amazon about the Blu Ray version. When I compared the product descriptions, ie., the Editorial Reviews, it appeared to be the exact same product only in Blu Ray. I returned the DVD format and ordered the Blu Ray. Upon receipt of the Blu Ray version, I was terribly disappointed! It does not include the ""collectible box"" & the ""retro ESPN hat featuring the company's original logo"". I don't know who's at fault, but I'm not a happy customer!"
1,That Price is ridiculous,This is nothing against the Espn Films 30 For 30 Series It was a great series. But the price of $899 is ridiculous.
4,love it. BUT...,"Make sure you check the details. Mine didn't come with a hat... not that I needed it, but It was in the picture, so I assumed...anyway..the videos are phenomenal. Love 'em."
5,Another great 30 for 30,If you're a baseball fan you'll love it. One word : Fernandomania. A great look into the contribution of one of the most naturally gifted pitchers to ever play.
5,Very well made series,"I enjoyed the 30 for 30 series. It is so interesting to have different writers and directors for each movie. They each have a different feel, and of course, story. Very well done."
5,Hope they make more in the future,"As a sports lover, I found the entire collection interesting, also a great value. i expected as much from ESPN, and thats what i got"
5,Fantastic Series!,"I purchased these DVD's as a gift for both my boyfriend and my dad. And let's just say, my brothers are jealous! These DVD's are so entertaining, you don't need to be a sports fan to enjoy. Each one is better than the one before it. I highly recommend!"
2,Poor condition of DVD packaging and unsure if DVD works,"I purchased this DVD and when it arrived it was practically falling out of the box and the DVD case was scratch and dusty. We have not had a chance to play it yet but I have concerns that it might be damaged from the condition it arrived to my home. If it does not work, I will definitely return it and buy it from a different distributor."
5,If you love sports,"If you love sports, this is a must have. I don't have cable, so I wasn't able to watch these when they were on. I caught the blu-ray on sale for around $60, and honestly, I would have purchased it if it wasn't on sale. The documentaries are very well done. Each one is different than the last one. The stories give you some insight that you may not have had prior to watching them. ESPN has continued after this making other movies that have been just as well reviewed. I can't wait until those come out."
5,Love it!,"I didn't realize when I ordered this I actually saw most of these on ESPN when they were on. HOWEVER, I find myself rewatching these again and again. Great, great collection! Also since it's on blu-ray, very little shelf space for 30 movies, which is huge!"
5,Love it!,I love these films! Product was as described. Shipped quickly and was much cheaper than I was finding at other retail stores.
5,Awesome,"This was a thrilling recap of a legendary battle between the Knicks and Pacers, specifically Reggie Miller, and an excellent way to introduce new Knicks fans to that history!"
4,Good to hear about athletes from the past,"As a guy who loves sports, its nice to get a little lesson from history and the great athletes of the past."
5,Fascinating!,"Well-made study of a life gone off the rails, through no particular fault of anyone's really. Yes, Marcus should have stayed at that first school, and admits it openly, but no ""villains"" to be had here."
4,Great Christmas gift,My husband loved all of these and had them all on the dvr but somehow they got deleted so he was very happy to recieved the blu-ray set for christmas
3,john SINGLETON,"I don't understand why John didn't get someone else to narrate the documentary. I also don't understand why he needed to be on camera. Every time he was shown on screen it took me out of the story, because his voice and scenery didn't match the rest of the documentary. Besides that it.... was a good addition to the 30 for 30 line up."
5,The birth of big air,I have enjoyed all the 30 for 30 films I have had a chance to see. The birth of big air was a good one.
4,"Doesn't contain ALL of his songs, but still worth the money!","""The One"", is not included(a fave of mine). And the album contains many live versions, the standouts being ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down Me""(WITHOUT George Michael - thank God),and ""Candle In the Wind""(both recorded from his 1986 Aussie concert). In addition, included are previously unreleased versions of some cuts. Such as the demo for ""Your Song"",among a few others. Also included, is a very large, color brochure with liner notes, history, pictures, etc. And the four CDs when placed together, form a jigsaw puzzle likeness of Elton's face,(I thought that was cool -Ah,the simple things in life!). I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, because this is not a complete compilation - songs WERE left out. I can't fault the quality, nor sound of any of the recordings. Buy it - you won't regret it. Enjoy,and peace to you and yours."
3,A good history,"This box set is a good but not great history of the first part of Elton's career.I would have preferred more demos, alternate takes, live recordings etc. I feel it is sort of a long greatest hits package which doesn't do complete justice to his music.But if you're just a casual fan of Elton then this is a good summary of most of his contributions to the pop world."
3,A page turner that doesn't satisfy,"Others have hashed the storyline, so I won't waste your time. Suffice it to say that this book is well written, with suspenseful turns that kept me interested. My disappointment lies in the fact that the solution to the mystery, the secret for which many people were willing to kill, was just not all that big a deal. I expected something EARTHSHATTERING,and well, it was sort of trite."
3,Gideon...God's loving soldier or a mediocre novel?,"First of all- There is not any relationship (or at least from what I saw) between the biblical story and this novel. No fires consuming food or 300 soldiers destroying large armies. What you do have is half of a good novel.... yes half. The first 250 pages are very compelling and shows the makes of a great read. The pages turn with great ease at first, but then it happens. You realize that things just don't seem to add up... Maybe it was just me but at the end of the novel of was left scratching my head wondering what-in-the-world just happened. Things just didn't make sense. I know thrillers usually have unexpected endings, but they usually have logic behind the plot twists. In Gideon- the plot twists just come out of no where and ... well...they left you wondering. However, I'll give it three stars on the strength at which the book starts.My suggestion? Read the first 250 pages and write your own ending."
4,Breathtaking thriller,"Lots of suspense, surprises, and the chase. Keeps you on the edge most of the way. Can find no fault other than the suspense early was so strong that the finale was just a touch disappointing. Nonetheless, if you enjoy thrillers, Gideon is just plain hard to beat. READ IT!"
4,"Good and fast paced, with a decent plot","Very good read, I enjoyed it, in fact, I just mailed my copy to my mom. It was fast-paced without being just a ""junk-food"" type of story. I had to ""make"" myself put it down and go to sleep at night."
1,WARNING!,"I am a mystery/suspense novel junkie... and Gideon was the one of the worst suspense novels I have ever read. I can't even describe my waning interest as the novel slumped after a wonderful, gripping beginning. I've never written a review before, but after Gideon, I felt is was my duty to warn other suspense novel enthusiasts."
3,A potboiler,"This book started out well and promised a lot. It soon settled down to an improbable chase through the south with two improbable charactors with inane dialogue and outwitting the entire law enforcement agencies and the bad guys while stumbling to a conclusion. Someone tell me why the ""Closer"" was called off of the chase to be replaced with the inept ex-cop"" Why would such an efficient organization use such an inept person anyhow. I thought most of the main haractors were sterotyped."
4,"Fast-paced, nail-biting suspense!",Gideon delivers like a big Summer action movie - non-stop suspense and suprising violence keep you reading through the night. Highly recommended for your next trip to the beach. Look for an ultra-hip reference to the Loveless Cafe outside Nashville. Best breakfast in the US of A!
4,To use an overused cliche...it kept me turning the pages,"It's been a while since I've read a straight out thriller, and I didn't regret reading this one. To be honest, I'm the kind of reader who tends to ""lurch"" through books...read 50 pages, set book down for a few days, read another 50, etc. Gideon had me turning the pages and coming back every day until I finished it, so I must say that I found it engrossing.The plot had some good twists but wasn't so complicated that I needed 3x5 cards to figure out what was going on. There were a few memorable characters, good villians, decent hero...if a bit stereotypical. Good action, high body count. Overall, I think most people would find it very entertaining.One other opinion...the identity of the Closer was laughable. Still makes me chuckle when I think about it."
5,Great Summer Read!,"I enjoyed this page turning thriller. This book is full of suspense that keeps you guessing. Watch out, the identity of the Closer will surprise you!"
2,"Much promise, never lived up to the first few chapters.","Good beginning, but spiraled down from there. Wish I'd waited on the paperback. Very predictable and very immature."
3,Gripping but....,"I just finished this book after having picked it up on a sale table. I have to admit that I had been intrigued by it since it came out and had wanted to read it, but never got around to paying full price.It is a gripping work, well written and tightly paced. The book is at its best while set in NYC, but when it moves out from there it begins to unravel. For one thing, the geography is off and, sorry, but I find this inexcusable. A quick consultation with Rand McNally would have kept this from occurring. For another, the author(s) push the abilities of the principal antagonists too far for credibility. Both the evil doers and their primary cat's paw are given just a bit too much power. A little more care in these areas and the book could have been stunning to the end. Alas, it is a good work and fun to read, but the book breaks the reader's willing suspension of disbelief and, in the end, does not live up to its potential. I still look forward to reading their next work."
3,Too many holes,"I read Gideon quickly, gliding past the tortured prose (it reads like a book written by committee, which it is) and the obvious plot holes more because I wanted to get it over with than because I was enjoying it.Gideon is one of those books in which characters who are portrayed as ruthlessly efficient and highly intelligent make stupid mistakes or illogical decisions for the sake of the narrative. Generally, this means that as soon as the story calls for them to fail and or die they must step out of character.It's also time, I think, to put to death the plot ""twist"" in which one the villain boasts about his evil machinacions while secretly being recorded by one of the good guys. Are master criminals all so self-absorbed they've never seen a movie or read a bad thriller?"
2,"Weak plot, undeveloped characters","Boring, implausible plot, even though author tries to throw a few (uninteresting) twists into it. Characters are undeveloped and act strangely. Romantic angle never takes. ""Momma-One-Eye"" seems taken right out of Stephen King's ""The Stand."" Evil politicians/media moguls done to death.Mostly a big yawner."
4,Intruiging and fast paced. I couldn't put it down!,"Gideon is a fast paced thriller that keeps you guessing on every page. The characters are diverse and plot twists are quite intriguing. You probably won't guess who the true killer really is until the final scene. The story within the story could have been more detailed, but the basic essence of who and why are laid out quite well. You will enjoy the book."
3,Extrmemly Average,"This book has a tremendous amount of good qualities, as well as a good number of aspects that I could do without. Although, over 400 pages, this book reads extremely fast. It it has a decent story line and is very well written, most of the time. Although a better thriller than Grisham writes, it seems as if the authors were trying to ""one-up"" Grisham with some ridiculous, movie-type events. As the reader, the main characters meant zero to me. I couldn't have cared less what would be their fate. I prefer being concerned with the protagonist and I wasn't here. It is difficult to put down, but when I did, I felt as if my time could have been better spent on other's pages."
5,Outstanding!,"From the first page to the last, this books keeps you guessing with multiple twists and turns. Nonstop action, great plot, fantastic characters, well developed story line, suspense, thrills and chills - this one has it all!"
4,Gideon,"My husband read this book first and kept commenting that he couldn't put it down. When he finished, I began. We made a great game out of it. He knew all the answers, I continued to read at every opportunity asking all the questions. Of course, he would not tell me what happened next or what the secret was, just led me on with a few mini-hints. It was great fun for us to compare notes when I did finally finish the book as there were tiny buried details in the story that I missed and he could fill in and several little pieces that he missed that I could fill in.The author's style was believable in that his descriptions aptly painted a clear mental picture of the scene. All in all, we found it a tremendously entertaining mystery with plenty of surprises along the way."
3,Pelican Brief Revisited,"Very similar to the ""chase"" book Pelican Brief written by John Grisham. Exciting to read, moves fast and introduces us to several interesting characters. The authors often create situations that are very possible and a bit eerie. It does become obvious that the book was written by someone (in this case someones)who have had plenty of experience in Hollywood. A lot of the familiar Hollywood chords are struck to give the appearance of a formula book looking for a script writer. I recommend the book for a good weekend read or to fill the time on a long flight."
5,Great Backpack for Sports,"This backpack is the best sport bag I have ever purchased. It is roomier than I thought. I use this bag mostly for my sport activities since it is made of mesh and it lets things inside dry well. My toddler and I use this mesh backpack mostly for swimming. It is big enough to fit our swimming suits, towels, baby pool toys, and changing clothes. We do not have to worry about drying our bag when we return home. The little zipper compartment in front is a convenient storage for my keys and membership card. I cannot ask for more from this practical mesh backpack. You won't be disappointed with size, comfort, and versatility of this bag."
1,Lose reliability after 4 months,"I've had these for 4 months, and rarely use them, have maybe drained and charged them 3 times in that span. Now, if I don't put them in the camera right out of the charger, they're only good for about 5 pictures before they die. They are so unreliable that they're basically useless now."
4,Reserva 2001,"Quite unknown album, the kind of discs you see (it's impossible not to notice this cover) but you don't listen to. I tried it out quite recently (December 2003) and I felt ashamed for my ignorance.Definitely quality electronic music filled of soulful and passionate voices, particularly Karmen Wijnberg featuring on ""Musical Mayday"", ""Duet"" and ""Telephone"" which along with ""All this means to me"" are my favourite tracks. I felt in love with this unknown stunning female singer. There are great details on this album like the acordeon on ""Duet"" or the flamenco guitar on ""Making love on your side"". Sponteaneuos, full of imaginative beats, can't take it ou of my mind. 4 stars because there are some songs below what I've just described but don't let this disappoint you, it would be worth to buy just to hear the ""Duet""...Congratulations, dear Howie B."
3,Howie B. - Folk,"Howie B. continues to defy expectation. If by picking up FOLK, you expected some gently twee English strumming, ""Making Love on Your Side,"" knocks that image out of your head with its wailing Spanish vocals and abstract trip-hop leanings. ""Musical Mayday"" has more of a traditional `folk' sound, but as reinterpreted by Mr. Bernstein, of course. The rock `n' roll classic ""Rock On"" gets slowed down and given a creepy chorus on ""Duet,"" while the languorous of ""Hey Jack"" gets a sure-footed kick in the ass halfway through. Some tracks like ""Watermelon Sugar"" don't seem as developed, but tracks like the minimalist ""My Wee Cod Piece"" help make up for that. The final thrumming on ""Telephone"" interact with the pretty vocals in an fascinating way - - almost like Bjork-lite. Intriguing, if not entirely successful."
1,botched scanning produces unreadable nonsense,"Warning: this is NOT a true optically scanned reproduction of the original pages like the Kessinger reprints which I have found wholly satifactory. Rather the text was scanned using ""optical character recognition"" software which somehow turned all of the mathematical proofs into unreadable nonsense, and the publisher 'General Books' did not even proofread their product well enough to notice this. For example, on p. 67: ""Hence the wholeaf at ..space s is greater than, and less than1, Itna 1 a Itn x -, and the sum is I x-i-x-I-,ai? at'2 2nTherefore it is equal to -; for if not let it be1 2at? ,,,equal to a greater quantity, as -+o, and letn fl. : then - = b; and therefore the space de-2b 2nscribed is equal to -+-: but it is less; which2 2nis impossible.""I am now returning this book to Amazon as defective, and will not purchase any reprint of any mathematical or scientific book from this publisher."
3,Not Bad,"not bad, but i like his earlier album, ""lonelyland"" better. most of these songs on this album are a little softer & slower."
1,Blasphemous,"I saw this artist on channel 11 last week and loved his music.He has a jazzy pop sound. I immediately went to Amazonto listen to soundtracks. I should have been more careful.The song ""god is my friend' totally does not give God glory.I am SO sorry that I purchased 2 Cd's from this artist.Garbage belongs in the garbage can. That is where it is."
5,Get this CD and see him Live!,"I've spent 5 years in Austin and I've seen Bob playing live virtually every time I got the chance to. that's at least 10 times or so. Sometimes, when you see a popular band live, you wonder if it's actually them on the record. Bob might make you think that way too, but in the good sense. His stage performences are amazing. It's a groovy mix of talent, fun, sincerity, and of course great music.... simply the best all-around live music I've seen.The Lonelyland CD is a true 5 stars must. I still listen to it after 4 years. This record might be a little harder to get into, except for 3 or 4 very catchy tunes, but that's probably because I haven't seen it live yet."
3,David in Austin,"It's a good CD, but not a great CD. It isn't as daring nor as versatile as Lonelyland. But it's still enjoyable. If there was a way Bob could take the beat and gusto of the Scabs and combine it with the genius and daring of Lonelyland, he would go double platinum (if that's what he wanted to do). Til then, he's got a ""safe and listenable"" album in ""I'm Good Now."""
5,How did I miss this in 2004?,"Y'all. Seriously y'all. I've got all of Bob's stuff - how did I miss this record? Bob's best album to date! One of my favorite lyricists around!Well I'm driving downtown in my big red Cadillacsipping on ice wine, mixing it with Similacfeeling the amazing flowof centuries in the afterglow"
5,I'm Speechless..........,"I'm speechless..absolutely astonished and amazed by what I read...Carie's insight, courage and intense clarity was overwhelming.I cried...I laughed...I held my breath! I was encouraged when I read what spirit taught and brought through her. I shook my head in familiarity and remembrance as I read those special words of insight and healing..I remembered why I was here...It made sense to me again. Carie's light and love clearly shines through her touching testimony of unbreakable courage and faith!"
3,Old fashion techniques!,"I love to look through this book, but the patterns are tedious. I would rather use my rotary cutting books to make similar blocks. I am not fond of having to add 1/4 around each of the templetes."
4,Just what my friend wanted,"Ordered this at the request of a friend. She was thrilled. It was in good shape, well packaged for mailing. Couldn't ask for more."
1,Why did they change it?,"I had my original Caruso steam unit, the one where you add salt, for 3 years, now I can't get through 3 weeks without it blowing some fuse or something. As much as I love the steam system I'm giving up. Kris"
3,this is not Shreve's best,"I have enjoyed many of Anita's books. This one, however, did not keep me interested. I looked forward to it with much excitement and it failed to deliver. Sorry."
2,Very disappointing!,"After 2 great novels (Fortune's Rocks, Last Time They Met) I was so excited when I saw that Shreve had a new novel being published this year.About a third into the book the story was going nowhere, and the characters are very shallow."
1,Lacks something,"The story was fragmented and her language is vulgar.People simply did not use this constant profanityin the late 1920's - I KNOW!!I believe Miss Shreve needed to do far more researchbefore she attempted this novel.This book is an utter disappointment, and I shall not finishit."
2,A sham,I think Ms Shreve writes for the money now which is too bad. Eden Close and Weight of Water were wonderful books. What happened to her? I think she's sold out.
2,the sad demise of anita shreve's talent,"Anita Shreve used to be a respectable writer. Now she's a talentless hack. This book sucks. It makes annoying references to Fortune's Rocks (her second worst book- the novel that marked the beginning of the end for Anita). Her books are too similar, Anita is a one trick pony. If you want to read it, at least just borrow it from the library, don't waste money buying it off Amazon."
3,IT WAS OK,i think that anita shreve books are just ok. i mean they could be better. i mean she just doesn't live an exciting life and she just makes it up. i mean you can tell that her life is not that exciting. where my life thing actually happen. maybe i should write a book. anyways. it is kind of boring like all her other books i read. this one book fortunes rocks that book was not good at all. it sucked and i didn't even read the first four chapters.
3,Was a little questionable,"This had some adult situations. It was a good book, but I would have liked to have been informed of the adult stuff that was in it!"
2,Not up to her usual standard...,"Anita Shreve has been one of my favorite authors. I had enjoyed everything I had read by her until now. Her stories are usually rich and beautifully constructed. This book was a true disappointment. The plot was flimsy and uninteresting. I kept waiting for things to improve but I must say that if this had been another author, I would have simply stopped reading.Don't judge Shreve by this book. Her other novels are excellent!"
2,just okay,"Having previously read The Last Time They Met, The Pilot's Wife and Fortune's Rocks (a book that stayed with me for weeks after I had finished it), I expected more from Sea Glass. At the end I was left feeling empty, and frankly, after writing this review will probably forget about it completely. It needed more density. It was just too short for such a compelling topic. By the way, it takes place on the New Hampshire coast (not Maine), and they were trying to unionize a mill (not a mine). Sorry but I feel if you're going to write a review you should at least keep the facts straight."
2,Not her best work..,"I have read every other Anita Shreve out there, and this isn't one of her best. She goes the extra mile, explaining in great detail every aspect of the book, but the end is sorely disappointing. Try ""The Last Time They Met"" or ""Where or When"" instead - two of her best."
3,MAYBE IT'S JUST ME...,"...I've read 5 Anita Shreve books and loved them all, except this one. I think maybe it just wasn't what I expected, given her other books (which I loved). Had someone else written it, I might have liked it better. I certainly got a clear picture of mill strikes during the Depression."
2,Could have been better,"Although I have enjoyed Anita Shreve's previous works, and admire her writing, this book left me unsatisfied, and I honestly don't know why. I would love to read more about Vivian, I think her character was very interesting, but underwritten. I felt as though the book wasn't over, what happended to these people? On another note, why do so many of the reviewers, including Amazon.com, refer to the character of Alphonse as Francis? Was there earlier edition of this book?"
2,Slow,Slow and rather boring. The title does not match the book. It was just too far fetched really. Bringing that whole mill situation into the book just did not fit for me. I read the entire book was disappointed.
3,3.5 stars,"I liked this book but I had a few issues.WARNING: SPOILERSWhat did Honora see in Sexton? I know for him it was love at first sight seeing her white hands...but I never was convinced that she loved him in return.And when did she fall in love w/ McDermott? When they were drunk and kissing under a tree? We knew he was falling for her before that moment, but I wasn't convinced that she was in love with him either.And I did not like the ending, who lived, who died and how Honora ended up pregnant and relying on Vivian. Why was Honora even allowed to live? Why would Alphonse's mother get shot but Honora was allowed to live? It just didn't make sense.Other than that I enjoyed reading about how life was in those days, and having grown up near the beach I loved the setting."
3,Had its moments,"This book was completey in style with other Anita Shreve books I've read - romantic, well-written, historical, compassionate. With that being said, I didn't enjoy it as much as some others. The ending wasn't completely as I predicted, which I give credit for. Worth the read, but nothing spectacular."
4,As seen through opaque lenses,"Sea Glass has that feeling of something old filtered through the perspective of time. It is a novel about the Depression era and how that desperation leads people to do things they would never have imagined themselves doing, such as forming a union in the slave wages mills. The characters each undergo unforseen changes. Honora finds that there is more to life than what she had imagined was bound by the traditional marriage vows. Sexton (her husband) discovers that sometimes you just can't sell. Vivian discovers a meaning to her life which has nothing, or at least not directly, to do with her money. McDermott discovers that love comes in strange and unexpected ways. And young Alphonse discovers that family are those you love, not just those you are born to.I think it was an enjoyable novel that has you anxious to see how it will turn out. The romance is light but meaningful. A good read. I recommend it."
4,Sea Glass sparkles,"With the time of war that we are in now, this novel takes you back to a time where people were struggling, during a different kind of a war. This was a war between the factories and the unions. This book was incredible! It tells a continuing story from the viewpoints of at least 6 different characted, but everything flows. Nothing gets repeated either. You just go from one person to the next and everything just ties in and fits together. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope everyone else out there does too."
3,Hmmmmm,"I started reading this book and about 100 pages in, I wasn't sure I liked it. Still I was gripped well enough to keep reading. I did not care how it went from character to character, and it seemed to have more of a screenplay feel than a novel. Still, I knew somehow all the characters would be tied together in some way, and sure enough by the middle they were. I did like the story, but I agree with a previous reviewer that it was lacking something. It was strange how the climax towards the end jumped from the eyes of each of the characters in chapter form. I think it may have worked better spread out more in the same chapter? Hope you understand what I mean if you read the book. Still, I found myself caring about some of the characters, esp. Honora, Alphonse and Vivian. I liked the book enough to recommend it for a good read, however, I have read better this year."
3,Rather let-down by this one....,"After reading The Pilot's Wife and being thoroughly enthralled, I found this book a much more tedious read. The characters were not very interesting, the plot seemed all over the place, and I just wasn't entertained. I guess it just wasn't my kind of story."
3,"Easy, pleasant, light reading","You could finish this book in a few days if on vacation. It is an enjoyable, cream puff of a book - easy to read and understand. Not a lot in it challenges in any way. I found the end to be very disappointing, though it doesn't ruin the enjoyability of the book and only really occupies a few short chapters.I thought I discerned a few things that were out of time. Such as a reference to the Wizard of Oz in the year 1929.Nonetheless - good, fluffy beach reading for summertime."
2,Very difficult read...,Focuses more on the mill strikes than the central characters... had a tough time getting through it! Definitely not one of Anita's best!
3,Not one of Shreve's best!!!!,"This novel was just okay to me. It not that I hated it, it just wasn't wonderful.I did read it quickly, but I wasn't excited with it. The theme & plot were well done, but I just don't think the theme was right for Ms. Shreve to write about--it just didn't work. I really like her work, but I just couldn't love this, like the others. I wouldn't recommend this, and if you have read this, and don't feel too enthiusiastic about Shreve, don't give up--read ""Fortune's Rocks"" or ""The Pilot's Wife""."
1,Disappointed,"I guess one can not expect a great read everytime.Found little of interest, and really did not care about any of the Characters. Her previous books have been hard to put down, this one was a struggle to finish."
2,way below average,"I am a huge fan of Anita Shreve. I devour her books in 1-2 sittings. This dull novel took me almost 1 week to get through. I was disappointed and not intrigued with the characters. I did find the protagonist, Honora, likeable. The entire narrative however was too simple. Exclamtions such as ""sea glass doesn't break"" when Honora's husband tosses it is just too simple and lame. The subject of the textile mills and New England was done so well in 'Empire Falls' that I felt here it was just dull.dull. Sorry Anita. Hoping for more intrigue in your next novel."
3,Not bad,"Sea Glass is a story about love and struggle. A newly married couple starts a new life together, venturing the unknown in a new place at the brink of the depression era.Other characters come into the picture. The caring mother, the lonely mill worker, the rich lady, the suffering family.. Events are narrated from the different perspectives of these main characters, unfolding the story as life eventually brought them together. The promising beginning, the emotional neglect, the turn of event, the coincidences, the forbidden love, the strike, the sacrifices.. Things are sometimes described matter-of-factly, without playing with the emotions. Yet I was sorry for the unfortune, happy for the graces, and suprised by the ending."
4,Good reading,"I previously read The Pilot's Wife, so I thought I would try this book. I was pleasantly surprised. I am not sure I like the format of writing each chapter in the perspective of a different person--in the beginning it is a bit hard to follow. The book reads well, once you get the characters. The end of the book makes for a nice reading straight thru as it it moves quickly and with some intensity. I would like to see a follow up to this book as the end is not really an end but more of a beginning."
1,I was greatly disappointed,"Usually Anita Shreve does not disappoint. Sadly, SEA GLASS failed to hold my interest. Knowing the author, I finished the novel because I hoped something unusual would occur and it didn't. More of the same, a sad love story once again with nothing new. Ho Hum...I won't be running out to buy the next Anita Shreve in hardback like I usually do..."
4,Excellent!,"This is vintage Anita Shreve. Richly drawn characters, descriptive settings, engaging plot that keeps you turning the pages. If you like Anita Shreve's style, you will love Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Both authors have a way of drawing you into a story and making you feel part of it, like you actually know the characters. Well worth reading."
3,Didn't grab me,"I've read all of Miss Shreve's work, and liked pretty much everything, especially Strange Fits of Passion, The weight of water, The Pilots Wife and Fortune's rocks. I thought this would be good also, however it just didn't capture me the way the others did...perhaps because there were too many characters and so little time. The plot and the historical impact of the book however was very well done and I applaud her for that!"
1,Her WORST book to date!,"I fell in love with Shreve's books after reading ""The Pilot's Wife."" I went on to read others, all of which I enjoyed. However, when I read ""The Last Time They Met,"" I began to doubt my devotion to her novels. And now, upon completion of ""Sea Glass,"" I feel certain that I will never pick up another of her books again. I did not like how she switched back and forth between the characters -- most of whom were completely not interesting. Honora and Vivian were remotely ""real"" and intriguing, but the men were very flat and boring. In fact, I found myself skimming through the last 150 pages just to make it to the agonizing end. I kept thinking that it would get better, but I was wrong. The ""massacre"" at the end did perk up the action a bit, but only to end with her typical sad ending. I advise all former Shreve fans to abandon her and look for entertainment elsewhere!"
3,Depression Times Two,"Although Anita Shreve's writing skill cannot be denied, why are her loyal readers continually hit over the head with characters who lead desperate, dismal lives doomed to endless suffering? There are so few rays of sunshine in Sea Glass, I felt mired in a chilly fog myself! Lighten up, Anita!"
2,disappointing,"My book club read this and we were unanimous in feeling that it had been an unworthy selection, and mystified by the extremely favorable reviews it has received. The descriptions of life during the depression, and the details of labor strife related to textile mills, were of some interest. But every element of the story seemed unerdeveloped, and the characters, in particular, lacked subtlety and complexity. The symbolism of the sea glass was simultaneously heavy handed and vague. The author has chosen a weighty topic, but because she failed to do it justice, even parts of the book that should have been devastating left me unmoved."
2,"Interesting, but was lacking something. . . .","Upon finishing this book, I felt as if it had been written with the sole purpose to be turned into a ""made for TV"" movie. The main characters, Sexton and Honora, lacked the kind of depth that would have made me warm up to either of them and it seemed that the ""real characterization"" was being left for the television screenwriter and actors. And, honestly, we could have all done without Honora's little hissy fit with the stinky lobster bodies!Believable characters to me were (in order of believability) Vivian, Alphonse, and Honora's mother -- very believable for the Depression era and their individual situations. I also enjoyed the images of the beach community and the sea glass Honora collected. The ending was disappointing, but again, let's wait for a better one in that made-for-TV movie!"
2,"nice looking bell, sound doesn't inspire a warning","I love the look of this bell, very nice. Only problem is the hollow wood ticking sound it makes doesn't mean anything to people that hear it. As much as I like how it looks, I had to replace it with a standard bell as people just don't recognize the sound as a warning, unfortunate."
3,"Nice looking, but only good for looks","I bought the Padauk version. While it definitely looks nice, it shouldn't be your ""real"" warning bell, as it doesn't ""clack"" too loudly when struck. For looks only."
2,MACB,"I thought that Mac B was not a very good modern day version of Shakespeare's Macbeth.If I had to give it a star rating it would be 2 stars. In this book there are 2 boys who are trying to get into a football team but there is some serious competition. At the start the two are best friends but there is a prophesy, that one will become captain then the other.When Banks gets injured Mac B seizes the opportunity to take over. When he sees his friend out of the house on a wheel chair he gets jealous.The ending is too dramatic. Mac B tells Banks all about how he paid the boys to injure him and that he ruined Dunks bike."
4,my review on macb,"I really liked this book becase it really gave me an insite to the play it was based on, Macbeath. i found that wonce I started to read it I just wanted to read more and that when ever my teacher told use to get our macb books out everyone wanted to get to the end but I must say that at the start I was dreading it because I didnt understand the first chapter and I needed it to be read over again before I understood. I would advise this book to anyone from the ages 7-15 and that is why I think it diserves 4 stars."
3,Great neutral set!,"This is a great neutral set that I bought for my baby's room. I didnt know which sex I was having but figured I'd pair this up with blue accents if a boy or pink accents if a girl. I ended up having a boy and it turns out to look great with blue sheets and solid red sheets. Next time I would not buy the set that includes a bumper because I have never used it. Aside from the safety issues with bumpers in cribs, the crib sheets are pain to change with the bumper (the bumper has to be removed). This is the case with all sets.Overall it looks great and was a good buy."
5,BIG O SEASON 3,"This is where season 2 really picks up, it sets off a chain of events that brings the union the paradigm corp, and roger smith all together. (...)"
2,Title is a marketing pitch that promises to make it easy for you. WRONG,"Maybe if you are business-retarded this book might give you some ideas about the process of starting a business. But most of the material can be found worded differently by online articles or by using some common sense. Therefore, the book really does not provide any unique perspectives or tricks. Anytime a book gives you the impression that you can achieve something in a short period of time or simplifies it in a few steps, you know the author has watered the topic down so much that it ends up being a waste of time. But, hey its a good marketing strategy; it got me to buy it!I'm a technology guy looking for a high-tech start-up book that really teaches you the ""ins and outs."" Does anyone have any recommendations?"
1,Author/ business marketer is below amateur!,"There are 10 marketers off the top of my head, who simply would blow this information in book away! Save your bucks!"
4,Very good,"I really enjoyed that book. The tips are very usefull and the step-by-step program is a real guide for staring a business properly. The layout, the tables and the check-lists, for me, are a huge improvement in comparison with other books I've read."
4,Awesome,I use to play this game when I was younger and thought my kids would like this. They love it! my ten yr old Plays it all the time. It's fun
2,bad Simpsons game,"Bart's Nightmare is a REAL nightmare. The game stinks, plain and simple. It shouldn't come as a surprise because back when the Simpsons were a brand new show NOTHING but crappy Simpson games were being released for the Genesis, Super NES, and regular NES.Skipping this game means you are skipping a big nightmare."
3,"okay, but not Simpsons material","I used to own a super nintendo and I had soooo many games. I suck at video games, but do enjoy them. This was okay, but I wasn't a Simpsons fan at the time. Heck, I had so many games, I'm still finding them around the house. I've now progressed oon to Playstation, so to be ps2 or gamecube. But I'll never forget this game. The one that got me hooked."
1,waste of money,"I bought this for my 3-year old son. I thought since he loved to open and close,lock and unlock things he would love this. Well this product was such a disappointment. The key does not turn the lock, it just fits in the grove created for it. The key has a tendency to get stuck in the grove thus causing some frustration for the kid and eventually leading to an adult rushing to the rescue. I frankly wasted my money buying this."
5,Not as Briefed: From the Doolittle Raid to a German Stalag,My husband couldn't put this book down and he has read so much on WWII
5,nice,"I recently bought this guitar and am very pleased with it, the smoothness of the action is above what i expected and it is a beautiful looking instrument. I did need to raise the bottom pickup slightly to access the tone i wanted but every guitar needs slight tweaking. Though i did not buy this from amazon i havebought other guitars from this site and have been pleased except for one occasion where the guitar i bought had a very low tone. This is definately worth picking up easy on the fingers for beginners but worthy of performing with. I find it best used for playing blues rock. It is good for some metal if the right effects are applied."
1,Here's the Scoop. NOT!,"Like the other reviewers noted the plastic parts that drive the scraper malfunction quickly. I got 3 or 4 uses out of the scoop before the cheap plastic broke. Thing is, the scoop itself feels hefty and sturdy and would be an excellent utensil if they replaced the plastic parts with metal. The scoop stills looks and works fine other than losing the scraper to help free the ice cream from it."
1,You Can't Judge a Book By It's Cover.,"Unfortunately the best thing about this book is the lovely cover.In this case definately don't judge the book by it's cover.The whole of the inside is black and white (and the photos are not even very good quality). I'm sure the infomation is OK, but quite frankly it looks so uninspiring I don't really feel like reading it to find out.Guess I'm just disappointed as I was expecting a lovely colourful, inspiring book and this is just a text book type. I would not have bought it if I had looked inside it.There are many other much better books out there."
3,Needs more straps to keep it in place,"The look and feel of the seat covers are great. My only complaint is that there needs to be more straps to tie it down. This would allow for a more snug fit. As it is now the seat cover moves slightly as you get in and out of the vehicle. So I have to constantly adjust the cover. The problem area is in the front, there is no straps in the front."
3,"more tiedowns, please!!!","Quality seems good enough, have only used it for about 2 weeks, thoughBut would it have cost them terribly to add 4 or 5 tiedown straps?By itself, without any modification, I'd give it 1 star.With a little bit of work, it's probably a 4 star product"
5,Very Happy With Purchase,"Seems to be well made and was very easy to install (if you have some basic DIY skills). And it looks nice too! Overall, a very good value for the price."
3,Pauline Viardot-Garcia Songs are always welcome!,"This album contains 18 songs written by a much neglected composer.The collection opens with ""Madrid"" which is a very beautiful song and perhaps the most appealing in this collection.With the exception of one song in Italian and one in German, the remaining 16 are in French. The album includes the words to the songs but, unfortunately, without a translation into English. The performers are fine but I cannot help missing the level of musicianship previously displayed by Cecilia Bartoli in Viardot Songs.Perhaps this CD might inspire future releases by other artists.""Cecilia,are you listening?"""
1,Not recommended at all...,This book is very outdated with very stale and cliche type information. I trashed it soon after I received it.
2,The Cheering Section,"In his biography of Partick Henry, Vaughan complains that previous biographers were unfair to the legendary statesman. Thus, he moves to correct this historical error by bringing forth a laundry list of glowing facts about Henry. While Vaughan does have a point about previous renderings of Henry's life, he does little to paint a more accurate picture of the orator. Rather, he glosses over Henry flaws, and presents us with a candy-coated version of the man. And Henry was a man--a good man, but a man nonetheless. Unfortunately, this biography fails to recognize that."
4,Good Book!,"I appreciate this book; and will refer to it from time to time when needed. I wish it covered more upon the aspects of what to do for continuing educational courses, because practically all of the approaches are based upon introducing new learners to instructional content."
4,"ID can be the long, and winding road","Rapid ID is hard to do well. This book has been a great guide, to help me personally ramp up my ID process."
5,Very Practical Guide to Instructional Design,"For instructional designers at all levels of experience and in all settings, this book gives insight and practical applications for the systematic design of instruction. It is also excellent for sharing with clients, colleagues, and professional who have limited or no familiartity with Instructional Systems Design (ISD). The layout and content simplifies the perceived complexity of ISD models and provides straightforward concepts and practices. A must for the professional developer's library!"
4,A Fantastic Resource,"I found this book to be an absolutely fantastic resource for anyone who already does, or who is interested in doing, instructional design.Many books go into instructional design theory. This book actually does what a well-designed course should do - it's a relevant guide for someone who wants to know how to apply good instructional design NOW. Theory has value, but theory doesn't provide you with clear and concise steps on how to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate a course. This book goes through that process - in that exact order.I've been doing e-learning design and classroom facilitating for a while now, and it was comforting to see things I've discovered through my own experience confirmed by what I read in this book. What's more important, I found great tips, tricks, and solutions that I will apply immediately in my course designs."
2,"The word ""Boring"" comes to mind.","My local Detroit paper raved about this book so I picked it up. Was I disappointed. It is basically a story of an old man, with allof his typical old man problems, such as memory loss, aching bones, sleep apnea, etc. It just so happens that it is Sherlock Holmes at age 93 in 1947. There is no adventure involved and whatever powers he once had are diminished by old age.Also, the book tends to ramble from one memory to the present (1947) and then back to another memory at a different time. He is not a likeable character and his musings are so jumbled and written in such a pedantic way, that you really don't care what the outcome of the story is. It took me awhile to finally finish this book because it wasn't interesting enough to want to find out how it ends."
4,"One Bone To Pick, My Dear Mitch!","The Raven has only one bone to pick with Mitch Cullin. How in heaven's name can you write a one and one-quarter page of acknowledgements without giving credit to the one person without whom your book would have been superfluous: to wit: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? Otherwise the book is a fine example of how age comes even to the greatest minds, and is a wonderful account of Holmes in his old age. He still has a murder to solve, however unusual the villains, he is still obserbvant, if forgetful, and above all, still Holmes. Naysayers, beware! The story WILL bear up under close examination. Kudus for the ""story within the story"", written by Holmes himself. Great stuff. But beware, Mitch! Remember to whom you owe hommage the most! Quoth the Raven..."
5,Its deep,"Best sherlock holmes story, after ACD'sI read and re-read the book, to understand the delicacies of the nature of elderly sherlock holmes, i am sure everybody has there own picture of sherlock holmes in there mind, but this one gets too close."
4,Wonderful!,"A Slight Trick of the Mind is a charming tale of an aging Sherlock Holmes. Always having been sharp of mind, he finds himself struggling with answers to mysteries that in younger days would have come easily. Woven quite nicely through the novel are Holmes' relationship with the housekeeper's son, Roger, his love of beekeeping and a trip to Japan only a few years after World War II. In between are the pages of his manuscript of a case from years ago that continues to haunt him.Sherlock Holmes had to dig deep within his aging mind and body to find the answers he was looking for but eventually the pieces of the puzzle came together. A Slight Trick of the Mind is beautifully written and a pleasure to read. I rate it 4 out of 5 even though Holmes was unable to solve my own mystery of how this book had landed in my collection. I may never know.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short"
3,"Nice writing, not very interesting story","This is definitely not a Sherlock Holmes mystery, so don't read it if you're looking for one. This is a story of the aged Sherlock Holmes living in Sussex with a housekeeper and her son. He tends bees with the help of the housekeeper's son. This is a story of friendship, loss, getting old, losing your faculties and not much else. I was a bit disappointed I have to say, not because I was looking for a mystery, but because I was hoping for more depth and more story.Cullin has a lovely writing style and I kept reading hoping for the story quality to catch up to the lyrical writing but alas it never happened. Not a long book, so it's not much of a waste, but I felt it was one just the same."
3,Don't be misled: this is NOT a mystery.,"Read it if you are interested in the character development of an aging man who ""used to be"" Sherlock Holmes. It contains rather interesting insights into the relationship of Holmes and Watson, oops, John. It's an acceptable pastiche, but it is not a mystery in itself (although there is included the mini-mystery of the Glass Armonisist.) It's a book about loving and losing, parents and children, living and dying, bees and wasps. Worthy topics all, but rather dreary and disappointing when when one is hoping for the game afoot. Cullin has a nice writing style, and the audio version is beautifully read by Simon Jones."
5,A masterful effort.,"If it's classy, literary novels like ""The English Patient"" and ""The Remains of the Day"" you fancy, than this little gem will leave you well satisfied.This is a novel of Sherlock Holmes. However, this is not a mystery. The year is 1946, and Holmes is more than 90 years old. He lives quietly on a country estate, seeing almost no one, save for his housekeeper and her adolescent son.The author has expertly crafted a multilayered novel taking place in three distinct time frames: the distant past filled, with memories of unrequited love; the recent past, and a visit to war ravaged Japan (the guest of a homosexual couple); and the unexpectly tragic present.Surprisingly emotional, full of vivid, heartfelt prose, ""A Slight Trick of the Mind"" is an unexpected treat."
3,Intresting look at an aged Sherlock Holmes,"This book has good and bad qualities to it. I found it fascinating to read the rambling thoughts of the great detective. His mind is still keen sometimes. But, old age has taken it's toll on him.There are a couple of storylines that intertwine within the book. The author jumps around frequently to different stories, and different time periods.Each storyline is fairly good by itself, although I found the endings to be weak. As if Holmes just drifts off in his narration with little closure.I suppose that is the way of the very old, but it's not a strong finish for the character we all adore.Its worth reading, if you don't mind Holmes being weak and doddering."
2,"Beautiful, poignant and sad, but not Sherlock Holmes","I bought this book because of my interest in Sherlock Holmes and the conceit of Sherlock Holmes at age 93. The book is beautifully written and is very poignant and sad. But it is not Sherlock Holmes. The novel would have been equally effective if it was about an elderly man who was experiencing the losses (physical and emotional) that come with age. Other than to lure in some readers with an affinity for the Sherlock Holmes of A.C. Doyle, I saw no reason to give the protagonist Holmes's identity. As I noted, the book is well written, very touching, and has much to say on the vagaries of memory and the bonds between a father and a son. But if you're looking for any of the traits or characteristics that made Holmes Holmes, this is not the book for you. It wasn't for me."
3,If youre looking for taste this is not it,"If you want an energy drink that tastes good this is not it. This stuff tastes like detergent with bleach flavor, and has the unpleasant aftertaste of artificial sweeteners. However it has the highest caffeine content per can of any other energy drink ive seen, and it surely gets the job done if you need to stay awake after a night of no sleep. Also, it is cheaper per volume then other energy drinks."
1,50% to 10% Juice? New Rockstar Juiced Fails to Rock,"Been drinking Rockstar Juiced since it came out. I hardly noticed the 70% to 50% change in their formula, but the new 10% forumla is horrible. Where Rockstar was once the best energy drink out there, this change in formula will easily put the other energy drinks with juice on top. Hope Rockstar sales plummit and they can see their mistake and make the change now."
1,10%??!?!?!?! how wrong is that????,"ok, I must have missed out on some kind of product review or something.... becuase I would never have agreed to this change in rockstars juiced drinks. I had one today for the first time and all I can say is DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks for killing the one engery drink I actaully liked!!!I hope rockstar thinks again really soon, becuase as of this moment I am off the soft drink band wagon."
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH ROCKSTAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ya for 10% juice rockstar......NOTI just had one of these new 10% juice version and they taste like crap, WTF is wrong with rockstar why change something that was so good to something that tastes like crap now..... goodbye my beloved 50% juice untill you return (if ever) I shall miss you. oh and circulation just hit my area with this crap."
1,Buy directly for waaay cheaper,"If you live in the continental US, you can by most (all?) of Rockstar's 16oz cans, in 24-can packs, for $48 WITH FREE SHIPPING."
2,Shipping costs,"Thought I was buying direct from Amazon, but wasn't. Product was fine, shipping took longer than expected, and shipping costs nearly doubled the price. I will be much more careful on ordering from Amazon, not just ordering through Amazon, in the future."
4,ROCKSTAR REVIEW,ITEM WAS AWESOME. SHIPPING WAS FREE SO IT WAS EVEN BETTER. ITEM WAS SHIPPED PROPERLY AND FAST!!! A+++ THANKS AGAIN. ONLY WISH THE COST COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CHEAPER BUT OVERALL PRODUCT ROCKED!!! THANKS!
5,Excellent Flavor,"Glad to see that Amazon carries Rockstar Energy Drinks. Personally, I enjoy this flavor compared to the other Rockstar and energy drinks. It has a great flavor and definitely boosts my energy! This one in particular is hard to find in stores and I am glad that this can be purchased with Free Shipping and have it delivered to my door. Try this out, you won't regret it!"
2,Bad Packaging! One Short!,We were expecting a case... but no - we got 23 cans thrown recklessly in a box that arrived with a hole in it - some of the cans were dented! Will not be making this purchase again unless we can be assured this will not happen again.
1,WARNING UNSAFE TO DRINK,I drank 2 of these bought from the local grocery store in a 3 day period in April 2012 and 1 RED Bull and it sped up my heart rate and made me go insane These drinks put me in a terror dream like state for 7 days and I was dreaming and hallucinating these are just as dangerous as taking bath salts and should be pulled from the market. I ordered a case of these from amazon in 2008 and it sped up my heart rate back then without the hallucinating though . Little did I know how dangerous these drinks really are these drinks may cause you to blackout and not realize what you are doing. note I also did not mix these with alcohol or drugs so god only knows what would happen to you then. FDA should Ban these
3,"Hides the medicinal flavor, but....","Length:: 2:29 MinsThis is my review, and yes, I fudged, it doesn't have pineapple juice, it has mango juice in it! Either, way, just watch the review, and all will become clear!God Bless ~Amy"
1,Bait and switch!,"Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice. It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like. Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice. They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories. The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site. This is a classic case of bait and switch. Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink. What a slap in the face to their customers. It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back. At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula. Will Rockstar be that smart? I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products."
5,The best energy drink around,This is by far my favorite energy drink. It is easily the best tasting diet with a pleasant berry flavor and has a nice kick that doesn't lead to a crash like a full sugar drink can.I switched to a Rockstar in the morning instead of coffee and absolutely love it.
4,Fabulous sick fun!,"This was not half as bad as I had been led to believe by other reviews i had read.Yes it's not got the budget of so many other ""nutter"" films, But if you want Cape Fear, er, watch Cape Fear.It does what it says on the tin- You will not have seen anything like this before, I smiled all the way through it.The guy who plays Russo (our protagonist) is completely barking to the point where he is happy to run round the streets with his willy out in just about every other shot, he shouts everything he says, most of which is unrepeatable here!The violence is cheap and unconvincing but because of the sentiment it works,It's very sexually explicit, mainly women, with close up shots of their bits all over the place! And the main character has a semi-on for most of the time (quite a big lad too!)It's sick, twisted, depraved, morally void and FABULOUS!Watch it with your mates, not your bird!Can't wait for more of the same!"
1,Onyx's hair keeps shedding!,"I bought (wasted) this with my allowance money because I liked the movie, but the second I combed her hair, a bunch of streaks came out, and the same thing happens even if you comb it really soft! Don't buy this!"
5,Beautiful!,"I bought this cd after seeing ""The Celtic Tenors"" in concert and I love it! They are the best!!"
3,Celtic Tenors - Remember Me CD,"I recently saw the Celtic Tenors live in concert. There, I bought their CD ""So Strong"" which was absolutely haunting. I couldn't get the melodies out of my head. I decided to purchase ""Remember Me"" from you. This CD fades in comparison even though it contained the songs they had performed in concert. It lacks life and spirit."
2,Boring as heck,"I have the computer game version of this. You wouldn't believe how boring this game is. I don't think I have a worse computer game. If you are looking for a fun game to play, don't even consider this one. I really should get around to giving it away sometime."
1,Not useful for what I need,"This is billed as a beginner/intermediate, and practical book.I would say it's more intermediate.It reads as sections of theory/definition, with a small example. I liked the first couple chapters, and I think it would be useful for a manager or analyst to get an overview of the terms, but I haven't found the rest to be that useful. It doesn't flow very well, and is hard to retain information.What does stick out in my memory from the text is that Weblogic and Weblogic Workshop are powerful, natural, and easy...These are the parts of the book that I found useful, well written, and/or just liked:Page 41 on ClassloaderChapter 6 on WebServicesPage 249 on Security(I did development on Weblogic 4.5-6.0, and am returning to Java from C++. I've read the first 80% of the book, and skimmed the last 20%.)"
3,Good but not great,"I use this with a Kenwood TK-2170 as a duty walkie while on patrol. Having said that, with the antenna right up against the body it is difficult for remote users to understand/copy what I am saying with the radio clipped to my belt and using speaker mic. Maybe SWR, maybe not. With the antenna being in open air (handheld), it works excellently. My only gripe is the antenna being unable to handle being belt worn."
3,Texas Twister of A Golf Tale,"This Texas twister has more turns than predicting an oncoming tornado. Built around the young caddie in a grudge nine-hole match, it turns from the match to the history that led up to it.From oil to paternity to con to snakes, they're all here. Not the best golf fiction this reviewer has read, and not the worse either. Kind of loses pace at the end, with so many turns before, you know that reality can't be all there is, so another turn is ahead. The steam is gone, as well as my excitement about this book."
5,lighting review,"I love this fixture. For the excellent price, it gives great light and looks great on my porch."
2,cute capote,"The film goes for cuteness. The kids in the movie are cute.Whenever the makers of this film thought that rewriting theCapote story would result in a cuter movie, they rewrote.The ending of the movie changes Capote's story to a shockingextent. I bought the movie because I thought it might be ateaching tool; I think I should have been given more of awarning about how much the story was simplified for filming."
1,Shallow movie,"This movie was shallow and cotton-candy like. I agree with the reviewer who said that he has a ""fantasty that every copy of this movie will magically disappear."" Many other films are more worthwhile to see than this film, which was focused on an extremely pompous and obnoxiously showy teenage girl.This nuisance(actress Tania Raymonde) did a lousy job in this movie, she did such a terrible job faking a southern accent. The movie was overall corny but she was even worse. She tried to cover up her lack of acting talent in this movie with pretentiousness and a pompous display. This girl is very pretentious and shallow and conceited! I think all she wants to do on-screen is show-off. Save room on TV and film for real, genuine people talented in acting please!(She is certainly not real and genuine. And she lacks talent in acting.)"
5,Excellent Film for the Entire Family,"This film is excellent and pleasurable for the whole Family. It deals with the harsh reality of racism, inequality and stereotypes with such grace. And not in a patronizing fashion. Lilly Jane comes to this small town and with classic southern charm and grace begins to wear away at the racist social structures in this town. Needless to say her group of friends also helps to rid the region of a notorious con man all the same. My children have watched this DVD for 5 days in a row and are watching it again now. Celine Dion does an excellent job with the voice over for Lilly Janes singing.Oftentimes it's hard for parents to sit through childrens movies, but this is not the case for this film. This is a excellent movie for everyone,children and adults."
3,Nice movie,"This movie was good.However, I felt that the role of ""Lily Jane Bobbit"" was miscast. The actress who played her, Tania Raymonde, seems to be much more suitable to play the role of a tomboy instead. She looks more suitable to play tough&rough; roles, for she looks boyish. Tania Raymonde playing Lily Jane Bobbit simply doesn't match! The role of Lily Jane Bobbit seemed less convincing and plausible because of this. Despite the nice wardrobe they made her wear in this movie and all of the professional makeup they put on her face, the character Bobbit still wasn't convincing."
1,Outraged!,I couldn't stand the pesky Lily Jane Bobbit. I'm glad this movie was just an independent film and not a major one.The movie was also dull and I almost fell asleep while watching this film.The other characters of this film were fine but Lily Jane Bobbit was merely insufferable. She is maybe the worst movie character ever. I'm outraged to know that this movie is availableon DVD and has also been shown on cable television!
3,"good introduction, translations are shaky","to me, they seem a bit contrived because he insists on having an english rhyme scheme and meter which makes me think he probably gave away something in translation.The introduction is a good basic introduction to the biographical data and accuracy available about the poet, some of his influences, and subject matter.I usually shy away from rhyming translations, but this is pretty good, and there are some excellent poems and stories in here..."
5,Best espresso glasses,"These are ideal espresso glasses. They allow you to see the crema during the pour, watch the settling and keep the shot hot until you are ready to drink it. They are remarkably light and feel delicate. They are apparently hand-blown in China and have a beautiful egg-like appearance. However, in the first set I bought, one glass had a small hole in the bottom (when I washed it water came in through the point used to blow the glass), but this was easily replaced. In other minor complaints, it would be nice if Bodum didn't feel the need to paint their logo across the bottom. Despite these minor defects, I love these cups and use them for every pour."
5,Find It At The Beach,"This was the first ""Find It"" we have purchased. LOVE IT! We have never used the little papers that come with it but just looking through it has been really fun. I plan on buying more."
4,Our kids never play with it?!?!,Our kids have never really played with this toy. I loved the idea when I saw it and just had to have one. I'm sad to say that out of 8 kids nobody has played it. Would make a great quiet time toy for at church or restaurants(sp?).
4,More Mythos,"This is a fairly good anthology of Lovecraft Mythos stories revolving around his short story ""The Dunwich Horror"". A few of the stories have appeared in other such anthologies, but you probably haven't seen most of them. At least it isn't yet another Chaosium effort, although the format is similar."
3,"If that's supposed to be Lavinia Whately, then have I got a bridge to sell you!","I have no idea what the point of the girl on the cover is, aside from ""sex sells"" but she's about as Lovecraftian as say, my right foot unless she's packing tentacles under her corset that we can't see (Lavinia Whately she ain't!) Most of the stories are fairly readable, Price's story followed by Nancy Collin's are both an unexpected pleasure while the one about the ""poor, widdle, maligned Wilbur Whately"" (boooooo-hooooooo) seems more an apologistic homeoerotic attempt to get into Wilbur's rather dirty trousers (rolls eyes - ironically that's the story I bought the book for because the idea sounded interesting, like a retelling of ""The Dreams in the Witch House"" from say the P.O.V. of Keziah Mason) than anything else. Still, the punch line near the end in re. the real reason for the unusual hills around Dunwich is interesting - the rest of the collection feels like something you might read on Fanfic.com"
2,only wanted original flavor,"I've read several reviews about this gum stating that the original flavor was ordered, but assorted flavors was delivered. I just figured people weren't being careful in reading the descriptions. Confident I had read carefully, and saw nothing about assorted flavors, I placed my order.You guessed it - assorted flavors.I'm not going to fiddle with returning bubblegum, but I am going to buy it locally so I am sure what I'm getting. It may cost more, but when 2/3 of what you buy turns out to be weird flavors, it may actually be more value."
1,Worst gum ever,"This is probley one of the worst pieces of bubble gum ive EVER chewed. It's extremly hard to chew and makes terribale bubbles.My daughter was conducting an experiment with bubble gum to see which gum could produce the biggest bubbles and Bazooka was the worst out of Dubble Bubble and Hubba Bubba. To be honest, id rather chew rubber."
1,worst game ever to date,I'm here at this date. Only because I still remember this game. Out of 100 some SNES games I had. I thought I was going backwards to the NES graphics. It's like the worst graphics on a NES yet it was SNES.men This one I had to throw away. I only watched it just to see how crappy the game play was. This is a game in it's own category. The crap category all by itself. This looks like a game to play if i was in HELL.
5,God I love it!!!!!!,"Okay, this thing is awesome. I hate lifting the toilet seat up, especially at night and now I just press the foot pedal down without thinking. The only issue I have with this item is the instruction not that clear but not horrible. I am not able to get the seat to rise all the way up but it raises up high enough. Did I say I love it for I do and I am going to buy another one when I move to my next apartment. All my female friends love it and so does my Mother-in-Law. the only person who does not is my wife because she thinks its tacky but her butt hasn't fallen into the toilet since I got."
5,Hands off toilet seat lifter,"This a great invention. My wife was always getting after me about not putting the seat back down when done whizzing. Now I push the lever and the seat goes up, when I take my foot off it lowers slowly and quietly without a hitch. Its easy to install even for a moron like me. Now I don't have to even touch the toilet seat which is a huge bonus I think"
5,Now I can die in peace!,"I have been waiting since the CD format was introduced in the mid-80s for this incredible album from the mid-70s to be remastered digitally. Countless searches of the word 'Nutz' until now only yielded references to incredibly tasteless albums or ""songs"" by talentless rappers, such as 'Dese Nutz'. I'll bet that's a toe-tapper. And now at long last, it's here. Anyone who appreciates the genre of pure, uncomplicated rock music would absolutely love this album. If you've never heard this - if maybe you're too young, or you didn't stray too far from mainstream music in the 70s - treat yourself to the great songs and great sounds of this classic record from that decade. I can't imagine someone hearing this album for the first time and being disappointed. Thank you, thank you, thank you for reissuing this great music on CD at long last!!! Great stuff!"
5,Heats up in a flash...,"I ordered this curling iron as a replacement for a ten-year old model from Conair that was taking forever to heat up and wasn't getting hot enough to hold a curl. This one has a larger barrel, which I was looking for because I prefer a softer curl. It does what it promises - within about a minute it is very hot and ready to go. Handling is easy, the cord is long enough for both left- and right-handed people. The placement of the off button is, as I read in another review, in an awkward spot and can accidentally be pushed while in use, but that has happened to me only once after about two months of use. My hair is medium-thick and not easy to curl, and this one works well. I also like the heat shield for storing the iron immediately after use."
5,Does the job,"It's a bit larger than I anticipated (my fault for not understanding the sizes), but it does the job well and is easy to use. I'm happy."
2,Not Impressed...,"I sent this item back after using it only one time- I'm just not impressed. I do have relatively thin hair, but I had a problem with it not holding my hair tight enough when trying to curl it. It also didn't seem like it got very hot, even at the highest setting.. Otherwise, the design seemed OK."
2,Didn't work on my hair,"I did too much research on trying to find a curling iron that was dual voltage and in the end, this one wasn't! But beyond that fact, I couldn't get my hair to curl with this particular curling iron. I have thick, coarse, curly hair that looks a heckuva lot better blow-dried straightish, then curled with a curling iron. I don't need to use any styling products to get curls to stay in my hair, but this curling iron compared to the one I use at home in Italy, which isn't ceramic tourmaline but metal, was immediately donated to a friend. Oh well."
4,Good Curling Iron,"I love the 60 second instant heat-up & that it has 30 temperature settings. At first, I had a little problem with a ridge from the clip, but with some practice I was able to adjust the angle of the iron in order to eliminate that. Now, I get nice smooth curls.The only real problem I can see is that the heat setting dial is in a bad location. With every curl, my thumb would accidentally change the dial. I had to make sure, after each curl, to check the number on the dial. That's not so hard to do for the price!"
1,Not Very Good,"I bought this product at an indoor flea market for a very reasonable price. I got it because i wanted curly hair. Mines naturaly straight/wavy, and its pretty thick, not THICK. But i went home and tried it, and it didnt work for me. My curls just fell. And they wouldnt stay. If you wanted to add some ""movment"" to your hair, its great, but dont waste your money if your want big curls."
3,Tip is way too short,"The iron seems decent overall, but the black tip at the end is way too short and I keep burning my fingers and thumb when I go to grab it."
1,Poor Design,Clamp does not hold hair. I returned the product for an exact replacement which had the same problem. Poor design. I would not recommend buying this product.
5,Great tool for thick hair!!,"I have hard to tame,hard to curl, frizzy/dry hair. My hair is thick (very thick!!) I curled my hair with this and the curl stayed without uncurling the whole time I was doing my hair!!! Which it normally does with other curling irons. I didn't have to spray each section that I did after, I was so Happy. & I curled my hair on a very humid day, it didn't get frizzy stayed soft all day & the curls stayed!!!! I'm sooooo veryy happy that I bought this curling Iron, it's the best iron I've ever had."
2,Nice BUT....,"I am very disappointed with this curling iron. My hair is very fine and when I have my hair ""clamped"" in this curling iron and start rolling it towards my head, my hair just slips out of it. I've never had that happen before and it is frustrating because it takes me twice as long to curl my hair. I have never had a problem like this before with any curling iron I've owned. Too, the plug keeps slipping out of every wall socket I plug it into. I've never had that problem with any other curling iron I've owned either.I wish I had gotten the Revlon ceramic curling iron. That is the brand I normally use and it actually costs less.I do like the sleeve you can put over the hot barrel."
1,Do Not Buy,This is the worst curling iron ever!! Everytime you try to wrap your hair around it you hit the off button by accident. Cool tip is too short so it burns your fingers. I should have listened to a couple of the other reviews. I sure hope this helps someone to not waste the money for this. I also could not return!!
2,warning,"I bought this for my wife so that she could use it overseas where there is 220v current. She does not like the curler because her fine hair slips through too easily and she can't roll her hair with it. I tried roughing the barrel with an emery board, but I am still disappointed. It might work better on coarser hair."
1,Barely works...,"I have very fine, almost stick-straight hair. Hair like mine shouldn't be too hard to curl witha good curling iron, but this will only curl the last inch of my hair! I've tried raising the heat setting and leaving it in my hair longer, but I keep getting the same result - straight hair with just one little curl at the very end."
1,Failed after 3 months of use,"I purchased the Infiniti 1-1/4 Inch by Conair MI29R Ceramic Hair Curling Iron. After nearly 3 months of use, the curler quit heating completely. By this time, all the packaging material has been discarded and your return policies seem confusing and difficult... no easy returns on something over 30 days!"
2,Make sure you have the right powerpoint plug!,I live in Australia the powerpoint plug is American (or maybe South American.. or both?) - and I can't find a converter any where. The product is now useless to me.
2,Buy a more expensive item,"In an effort to save money, I chose this inexpensive curling iron. It works as advertised and has all the bells and whistles one would want. However, it seems fragile, not as sturdily built as some of the other models and I suspect it will not last as long as the others I have had. With postage costing so much, I think it would be wise to buy a more robust model and pay a bit more."
2,Turns itself off,"This curling iron turns itself off during the 5 minutes it takes me to curl my hair in the morning. When it does, it refuses to turn back on unless it is unplugged and plugged back in. This would otherwise be a great curling iron. It heats up quickly and leaves hair smooth and shiny. I like the variable heat settings (though it's easy to bump the dial when curling). However, I am replacing it after a month because of the power problem."
2,Badly Placed on/off button,"The on/off buttons are in the position shown on the pink/purple iron above, not on the close up of the black one. It is really easy to hit them with your fingers as you manipulate the iron and turn it of. Many new conairs have this issue. Shame - this one is going back."
3,Some disappointment,"While this is a useful, fun book to get a basic handle on Brazilian Portuguese, it does have a major failing in its guide to pronunciation of the language. The book while good at phonetically spelling out the words fails to indicate on what syllable the stress should be placed. It does indicate that accent marks indicate stress placement, but if the word lacks them, just where should the stress (what syallable) be when saying the word? For example, the word ""onde"" (where). It does not tell you if its OHN-jee or ohn-JEE. You really need to use a Portuguese grammar manual or audio tapes/CDs to tell you how to correctly pronounce the words. For the record, the stress in this case is on the OHN. The text just has ""ohn-jee.""This should be corrected in the next edition to better teach the Brazilian variation of Portuguese."
2,Good for learning vocabulary,"If you want to learn a lot of individual words, this book is pretty good. It has a lot of lesson type activities in it where you write down the correct answer or whatever. I got about halfway through the book, then was a little bored and never finished it up. It isn't very good at getting you up to speed on conversational Portuguese. For that you need formal classes or the Pimsleur's Portuguese CDs. It does have a lot of vocabulary in it, with pictures."
3,Trying to Learn,This is a wonderful book if you are going to be in Brazil for a very short time. It is also a good beginner book. Unfortunately the pronunciations (esp at the end of words) is hard to understand. My husband is from Brazil and we will be going there soon. He had to correct me the majority of the time when I was pronouncing the words how this book has outlined how they should be pronounced. Overall it is a nice book but you might want need a tutor as well to get the sounds right. If you are going to be staying in Brazil for a longer time you will need a better book for sure.
4,Pretty good for building up vocabulary and the basics,"First of all, I'd like to say that this is a great beginner book for anyone just starting out learning Portugus. If you want to learn the basics, then you should start with this book. The pages are colorful, bright, and even comes with little goodies like peel-off stickers you can take off and put around your house, and cut-out cards of basic phrases and words. You skim the surface of the Portuguese language, and that's pretty good for when you go on to more advanced books. I think this book follows a lot close to Brazilian Portuguese, than European Portuguese, and the books typically uses phrases found in Brazil, so I'm not sure how helpful this would be if you were trying to learn European Portuguese"
2,just words,"With Portuguese in 10 minutes a day, first surprise: you dont have to study 10 minutes a day, there are no structured lessons, just a huge list of vocabulary, not always useful. You learn the colors and all the objects in the house before to learn ""oi, tudo bem?"". Bad choice."
1,This is a piece of junk!,"I have read some terrible books, but this is by far the worst history textbook. It is filled with Eurocentric notions of culture and civilization. The uses of ""barbaric people"" and ""civilized people"" don't make much sense. For example, he considers the Native people barbaric. The Native people are not the only ones whom he considers barbaric people. He also suggests that Hinduism is based on the Indus cult. I am not a Hundu follower, but I find that offensive. He could have written that there was a connection between Hinduism and the ancient relgion of the Indus region. I am seriously questioning his understanding of history because it looks like that he is not familiar with cultural relativism or any other sociological theories. Yes, he does discuss the world history. The scope of this book is too big for him to handle. As a result, the book is often misleading and inaccurate. I think he made no attempt to correct this because this is his fifth edition."
5,Laughter at the Art Museum...,"Picture (if you will) your standard Fine Art Museum dropped in the middle of a typical large center of population. There is an art exhibit that includes many works by John Singer Sargent and you weave your way through the crowd of art stiffs and critics to view the amazing painter's work. You pause to look upon the famous piece titled, ""Repose."" Then you have your mind suddenly overtaken by ""Dead Girls"" by Voltaire and you almost have a giggle fit amongst the art critics because you can't shake the fact that ""Repose"" suddenly appears to be about necrophilia. That happened to me, and I warn you that this CD is so good that it will stick with you and maybe happen to YOU too! There are a lot of things you might listen to over the years, but this will be the CD you come back to every time. Excellent work!"
5,Awesome Album by an Awesome Individual,"Voltaire has done it again. This CD is wonderfully put together, with songs of love, loss, humor, revenge and all those other little things that a good Goth needs. I've met him twice (DragonCon '99 and '00) and he's one of the coolest people I've ever met! I got this CD at Dcon '00 and have listened to it nonstop ever since!"
4,The price and functionality is right.,This selector is very affordable and exactly what I needed to integrate my sources into my home theater system. I have had it for 2 months and it works great. I read customer complaints about the rotary switch being misaligned and it also not staying in place when set to a specific setting. No worries here. I tried to shift the switch off of its center and there is absolutely no play in it.
3,OK for the price,"This is cheap and you get what you pay for. The game is alright and keeps the kids entertained sometimes. It has no educational value. And it has to beep when it first comes on muted or not. There is no place for earphones or a power plug and it eats batteries like candy. If you like this kind of game, rechargables are reccommended."
3,Enough to get you through the examination,"Pros:a) The book covers the examination syllabus almost entirelyb) The chapters are concisec) The scenarios at the end are a good preparation for theexamination.Cons:a) A number of typos in the examples - was this book publishedin a hurry?b) Content is repeated across different chapters.c) The safe white papers at http://cisco.com/go/safeare more comprehensive, have no typos and best of all,are free."
2,not well written,"This is not a poorly written book but definitely not a well written one either. It lacks details and the authors are confused about ingress vs egress. It is hard to follow some areas. A typical poor to so so quality book from Cisco Press. Disappointing yes. Waste of money yes. If I were Cisco, I would look for another publisher. Cisco needs house cleaning."
4,good,"This is some strong tea people. It's not matcha like I thought, but good for cleansing and metabolism support."
5,Breath of fesh air,I love this disc!! I like it because its all music. No lyrics. I can slip on the headphones and let my brain unwind. it has a spacey electronic sound with light to medium beats. Check it out if you are looking for a good unwind disk.
1,The one thing people hate in video games,"Here's an idea, make a game with gameplay the one thing people hate in video games: escort missions. Yeah people, that's right, what probably should've been a simple platformer starring Rocko gets bent and twisted into a very annoying puzzle-platformer game where you have to escort Rocko's dog Spunky from the left side of the level to the other. And although this game is a spot on representation of the cartoon it isn't the least bit fun to play, since Spunky is as dumb as post (much like in the cartoons). And it becomes more frustrating then trying to thread a neadle when he gets into trouble and you lose because of him.Get the videos of this show instead."
4,Very good album,"This album is one of my favorites. It's a real shame it's out of print because it's a great example of how mix CD's should be made. It starts out slow, works its way up-tempo and then ends up somewhat slow and mellow. DJ Heather is big on variety, which may frustrate those who prefer consistent vibes. I like it either way, as long as it's done well. DJ Heather does it well."
2,Not what I was expecting,"As I proceeded through this book, I found myself doing more skimming than reading. It might be useful to you if you don't have a clue about network programming or internet protocols, to get your feet wet using WinInit and the supplied classes, but if you're looking for nuts and bolts information about protocols, THIS BOOK IS NOT THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. The projects in this book rely on WinInit and MSIE to perform the magic, and you won't learn much about the underlying protocols. I was also disappointed to see typos and errors in virtually every example in the book; bad news if you actually read the code to try to understand how things work."
1,This book is vague and full of canned Microsoft techniques.,"Pallmann writes of tricks and techniques that rely on a world where web page information remains static. Bots that harvest fixed format information depend on webpages that don't change the format or structure of the data.While the techniques are valid, this book describes a technical solution in search of a problem."
5,Archeo Guy,"I just finished reading this book. I don't read much fiction, but this book was a real page turner. It has a rapid fire prose style. You can certainly tell it was written by someone that has lived in Israel. The geography of the narrative gave the story a very intimate feel."
2,No Tech. support at all!,"No tech. support at all from SMC. I have send 3 emails to the SMC's tech. support for the last two weeks. But no answer at all. After spend almost 2 hrs listening their waiting message, I finally gave up. Sorry, no further business with SMC from me."
3,"drops connections, needs power cycling, no support","I'm about to toss mine into the trash. It times out TCP connections if they've been idle for awhile (30 minutes?). So you can't use it to ssh into your servers and leave a session up for a day or two. Sometimes the whole thing crashes and requires power cycling. An email to SMC's support staff regarding these issues went unanswered.Not sure if this is a bug or a feature but by default the SMC box comes up as an open 802.11 server with no network name and no WEP key (i.e., if you think that you aren't using wireless your neighbors may well be cracking into your network).My old SonicWall was a lot better. It also timed out ssh connections after some idle time but you could change the default from 5 minutes to 9999.*** okay, after a (relatively painless) firmware upgrade, the SMC no longer drops connections. But I still ripped it out of my network because I wasn't comfortable with the idea of a by-default open 802.11b base station."
2,Dropping conncetion...,I am not sure what the problem is but I can reproduce taking down my whole LAN by copying large files form a server to a wireless laptop through this router. It even requires me to reboot the DSL modem to get back online. I would also have expected a better range.
1,"Scam Warrenty, Zero Tech Support","SMC's ""Lifetime Warrenty"" is good for the ""Lifetime of the Product"", which means that when your product stops working after 1 year (like mine did) they won't fix it. And that's only after you try for days and days to get through to tech support. If you call and they're ""busy"" you don't even wait on hold, they say ""call us back later"". And of course, when you call back later, they're still busy. I went through this cycle for days and days until I finally got through and was told my warrenty was worthless.Buy this product at your own peril."
5,Even a non-geek can do it!,"Well, a pseudo geek at best. I had my cable modem installed today, came home, and in about 12 minutes I had the SMC wireless PC card in my laptop and the router connected and configured! It's about as tough as plugging in a lamp! Buy this stuff! It's amazing!"
2,Not the easiest or most reliable...,"Like somebody else said here... I used this for about a year or so thinking it was great but not realizing that it really wasn't. Looking back, many times it needed rebooting and true enough I never got the wireless wep security setting working. So anyone could've hijacked my internet connection and network. Finally it died and I dumped it - got a Siemens SpeedStream model 2624 instead and it works beautifully - much better."
3,If you are a gamer DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,Hosting a game in gamespy is nearly impossible with this router. I have opened the proper tcp/udp ports and even gone as far as putting the pc in the DMZ zone. If you are purchasing this router and like to host games i would seriously reconsider. Otherwise this unit blocked all and worked just fine.
1,Very Poor Quality,"While some people seem to be happy with this product, I think they must have been lucky. I orirginally purchased it because it could be used as a router, print server, and wireless access point. Unfortunately, it failed in all three of these functions. As a router and wireless access point, it would work for about half an hour and then simply stop transmitting. Only resetting the device would get it working again. After contacting tech support, I got new firmware, but the problems continued. A search on Google revealed that I wasn't the only one who had this problem, and none of them had it resolved. I would strongly urge anyone considering buying an SMC wireless router to consider another brand."
4,A steady performer for many years,"While my folks have gone through 3 or 4 routers; this one SMC barricade has served me since 2001 with no complaints.It is now starting to stop working every so often, so I have to reboot (pull the plug and plug it back in) so I am ready to upgrade.Signal strength has been great - I can get signal from the far corner of my basement without a problem, anywhere inside the house, and outside as well."
4,5435 router hangup problem + V1.42.005 firmware upgrade,Yes I have one of the dreaded SMC7004AWBR 5435 modelsand it has been hanging. Like some of the posts thatfollow I have upgraded the firmware from the www.smc.comwebsite.My router which I imported to Australia from the USA inMarch 2003 shipped with V1.41.004. The latest upgradeat late Nov 2003 is V1.42.005.1 am hoping this upgrade will fix the hanging problems!
2,DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH VPN AND NETMEETING.,"This is an excellent router as a basic wireless access point. But you are going to loose some functionality: VPN and Microsoft NetMeeting. Even if you set your computer's IP address as DMZ, the VPN and Microsoft NetMeeting does not work consistently through this router. So be careful if you plan to use any of the above. The Linksys router that our IT department uses works perfectly. So I bought this router but can not connect to work through VPN (SonicWall). Makes it pretty useless for me.Plus the tech support takes hours to answer the phone, plus they are not much help. All they say is to set up your computer as DMZ. This is supposed to wide open all the ports, NOT..."
2,Sorta works,"I've had the same problems that others have already mentioned. Good product and router except:1) Problems transferring large files over wireless. The router hangs and needs to be ""rebooted"" or powered off, and back on to reset and work again.2) Had problems recognizing IP using Dynamic IP, had to use Static setting, after upgrading firmware & reseting to factory, this finally worked.Pros:1) Has built-in DNS which I've seen others don't quite do within the local network.2) Easy we-interface to configuration.3) Built-in print server.4) Great range and reception from my entire home.Overall, I really wanted this product to work, but eventually returned it b/c of the file transfer problem. I got a D-Link instead and have had no major probs with that."
4,"Great router, especially for the price","In terms of what it offers for its price, this router cannot be beat. MAC Address Control, a built-in firewall, web-based configuration, and many other features make this router easy to set up and get running. As with all wireless products, don't expect your range to be too far and go through any more than 5 or 6 walls. Besides that, it has worked very well with PCs and Macs. The only problem I had was setting it up to do PPPoE for a DSL login, but that just took a little bit of extra work. Also... on really neat feature is its ability to clone the MAC address of the computer with which you are setting it up, so if your ISP does MAC control you won't have to call them up and wait on hold forever to get them to allow a new MAC address on. Just another little feature that makes this an overall great product."
5,Works great.,"I use it every day. The only problem I have is that it makes my 2.4 gigahertz wireless phone pop a little, when I am close to the wireless router. I cant blame the wireless router, all of them work on the same frequncey as my phone. I have not used the print server feature yet, so I cant comment on that. But the wired part of the router, and the wireless part, work perfectly. Easy to set up too. At least it was for me. Cloning itself to your mac address was a very important feature. I use this wireless router with a cable modem."
4,works for non techie,Its not perfect but its a very good solution for someone who doesn't want to run cables or hire someone else to set up a home network. Documentation is sparce but it only took me (non techie) 20 minutes to get it up and running with my cable modem. Very satisfied with performance of print server and network functions.
5,Very easy setup,"I installed this as a suppliment to an existing 10-100 switched ethernet network. Installation was extremely easy and instructions were on the money. Very satisfied with all aspects of this device. Use every option, setup is simple and can save you money in the long run by allowing you to turn off that PC sharing your printer! Add another access point to extend your wireless range. Great reception under 25' marginal after that when installed in houses but will not penetrate the ground. Very Satisfied."
4,Good Routher for the money.,"Have been using this router for 3 months now. It did require some tweaking around and a bit of a frustration during the initial setup (that is why 4 instead of 5 stars).Nonetheless, it has worked flawlessly since then. Do expect to see a decrease in speed with 128-bit encryption enabled. Range is great and compared to the comparable Linksys model (which I have also used), this model tends to work better in an environment with numerous walls between the router and the wireless PC card. It Has only required a re-boot once in 3 months of usage. Be sure to upgrade to the latest firmware, though."
2,"Great product concept, but locks up a lot","Product concept (wireless AP, print server functionality, etc.) is great, but execution falls short. It locked up frequently for me, forcing me to do a power reset about once a day. Updating firmware didn't help at all. If you browse the SMC form ...you'll find plenty of people experiencing the same problem.After weeks of trying to get it to run reliably I gave up and bought Netgear FM114P. What a difference! Whereas I wasn't able to go on for a day without lock-ups, Netgear has been running non-stop for days with no problems. I should have done this long time ago.My recommendation would be to buy Netgear FM114P instead."
1,"Sadly, I am having the same problems as others","Usually I understand that there are lemons out there. I read all the negative reviews (and positive) of this device. There were many more positive than negative so I rolled the dice. Well, I got burned. I am having the exact same issues others are describing. Initial traffic works for a while then comes to a grinding halt (faster halt if I use WEP). The dialup seems to work okay but its communication with my LAN boxes at high speed that is problematic. I've used both Cisco Aironet 340 and Lucent Orinoco cards. I have the ""bad"" model others refer to. I will be calling tech support for a replacement. If they give me [problems] I'm returning it. Features are great but they need to be reliable."
3,Very Short Range,"Overall I like the product, but I am really disappointed with the range of the wireless. For some reason I cannot get connection when I am less that 50 feet away. It seems to work fine in ""line of sight"", but has major problems when the there is a wall or other obstructions."
1,"OK for single connection, but otherwise locks-up often.","This router was quite easy to setup, and works great for a single wireless or wired connection. But as soon as I get two computers on it and creating network traffic at the same time, then I often get slow-down, and soon afterwards, a locked-up network.This happens very quickly once I start using the laser printer I have connected to this SMC router/print server.It's very frustrating. I should have kept my Linksys router & Linksys print server combination of products - there were no problems. I could have added the wireless network router to my existing setup."
1,Initially Good Range. HORRIBLE SUPPORT! Now it doesn't work,"When I first received my wireless barricade in 12/01 I was wowwed by the range and ease of initial setup. However, as I try to do more complex things such as turn on WEP security, MAC address control and opening specific ports to let outside programs reach me, things work half way or not at all. When I try to reset everything to get simple wireless connection it doesn't work. It is probably my ignorance but how will I know since I get no email response or phone response.Can you say good product. Company unable/willing/ready to support product. I can say buy something else!!!You'll get better support from an athletic supporter!THINK THREE TIMES BEFORE BUYING. WAIT UNTIL USERS REPORT BETTER SUPPORT!!!"
2,Horrible Range!,"I bought this router from amazon[.com] almost a year ago. I was so excited to have a wireless network running that i didn't notice all the flaws. I never used any wireless network so i didn't know how much range to expect, but I knew that something wasn't right when my connection would get cut in half if i just went to the room next to the router. Now i'm stuck with a router that won't even let me access the internet from 30 feet away."
5,Great Wireless Router for the first timer!,This was a very easy to install and use device. The instructions were straightforward and it works like a charm. I am able to direct connect my home PC and have a wireless laptop connection simultaneously. We have them both connected to a high speed internet connection. One of the reasons that pushed me to this particular model is that fact that this router had a built-in firewall to defer hacker attacks.I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Awesome!,"I purchased this product plus the wireless SMC card for my laptop running Windows XP Professional. I was somewhat worried due to the fact that compatability with Windows XP was not heralded in SMC's literature. Apparently, there must be some hefty licencing fees because I plugged my wireless router in and my card into my laptop and it worked perfectly INSTANTLY with no set up. I have had my laptop 100 yards away and the reception is great. I could not be happier with the SMC7004AWBR..."
1,Don't buy it unless you're like cutting yourself with razors,"I'm in the business of setting these things up.I can tell you, some of these units work, some don't, and some are on-again-off-agan.Overall, not even a good unit for someone who likes to piddle around with hardware as a hobby.SMC is moving boxes with this thing; but making lots of enemies.Stay away from SMC- they do not care about your problems."
1,Some are defective. So is the customer support.,"Buying a 7004AWBR is a crapshoot. I just wish I had known the odds six months ago. My 7004AWBR saga has recently ended (I hope) with the promise of a full refund (not including the cost of my wasted time) from someone who is high enough in the SMC support hierarchy to admit that certain lots of the 7004AWBR are known to be defective.The problem isn't simply that some of these don't work, it's that getting a replacment or refund took me hours and hours of time on the phone nearly threatening people to get any kind of resolution. I'm left wondering why a company which knows it has a malfunctioning product risks losing customers who are likely to go around spreading the news of their terrible experience to hardware-buying friends, familily, coworkers, and in public forums?If you buy one of these, I sincerely wish you a better experience than I have had. I will never buy from SMC again."
1,Don't buy it,"It works fine as a router but if you want to use it as a wireless access point, try to find something else. I was using it with a Linksys card for my laptop, and the moment the distance was greater than 10 feet, it simply stopped working.I thought that the problem is with the Linksys card so I bought the SMC USB wireless network adaptor and again, same results.My advice, if you want a good wireless connection avoid this product."
1,Absolute junk! Locks up. Support is a joke.,"This unit is feature rich, and quite simple to setup, but it is plagued with techical problems and support is a nightmare.The most serious issue is that if you transfer any more than a couple of Megabytes of data through it, it locks up completely. It can be reset through the web interface from the wireless, or by unpluging it, but the next time you challenge it with a floppy's worth of data....down it goes.Secondly, if you use the WEP encryption, to encrypt your wireless traffic (which you should!), the data throughput drops as much as 75% (e.g. without encryption 8-9Mbps, with 1.5-3Mbps).Finally, SMC's idea of a solution to the problem is to replace the new one I already own, with a factory refurbished one that HAS THE SAME PROBLEM!In two words....run away....far away!"
2,"Easy setup, but unstable and no uPnP","I was initially so thrilled with this device that I bought my brother one too. The print server in addition to the wired and wireless router functions is of tremendous use to us.Unfortunately instant messaging voice conversations don't work over this device, even when using the DMZ and trying to open holes in the firewall as described by SMC tech support. SMC has also been very latent in getting new firmware out for it.It has also proved unstable and sometimes slow when using the MAC address filtering features. Security is also somewhat flaky. In short, for a basic, unsecured wireless/wired router and print server it is tolerably reliable. If you want voice chats or rock solid reliability, however, I'd look elsewhere. Linksys tends to be more standards compliant."
2,great with 98SE; lousy with XP,I've had this for over a year and loved it until I upgraded to XP. Now I absolutely can not print to my Z52 anymore. It couldn't handle bidirectional communications with the printer before but I could live with that but now it just won't talk to the printer at all. Customer support stinks if you can manage to get an answer from them at all. They just reiterate what is in the manual. I've been working on this for 3 weeks now and am about to give up on it and try LinkSys.
4,Great Product,"After looking closely at both the Linksys and the SMC, I decided to go with the SMC. Biggest advantage, print server built in to the router. Lets face it, if you are building a ""wireless network"" then why worry if you can hardwire 3 or 4 computers to the router. Having the print server is a huge plus. The range is outstanding. In a 2400 sq. ft home, my laptop never drops below 75% signal strength, and I can easily maintain that signal out in the yard. Only tough part is installing the print server to work correctly."
2,Customer Service Stinks,"I am writing this review while I am on hold for SMC technical support. So far I have been on hold for 45 minutes. This product was supposed to be easy to set up. Wrong. I have tried everything to get this thing to work. The WAN link cannot obtain an IP address from my service provider (Comcast). By the way, still on hold."
1,Hot Product!--(literally),"I've heard great things about this router, so decided to try it out. I didn't get a chance to test it though, because when I plugged it into the wall power outlet, thick, white smoke began pouring out of the top of it. Luckily, no other components were damaged, but needless to say, I was disappointed.I'm sure, however, that this sort of thing only happens in very rare situations, and it was probably some kind of simple wiring problem. I have returned the item and a new one is on the way. So, as long as this one doesn't catch fire, I look forward to giving another review on the WORKING product."
4,Print Server setup,"I wrote a previous review on the SMC Barricade below and just wanted to add some more info now that I've tried out the print server part.The Print Server is a plain old LPR daemon. So any machine with a LPR capability (NT/W2K/UNIX) should be able to print to it without any software install. Which is good because the Print Server software that SMC provides completely screws up parts of the the printing configuration on my XP machine. Not in a harmful way, though. Just creates these gibberous ports that don't do anything. Needless to say, the PRTMate port does not work in XP.Anyway, you need to configure the TCP/IP port as standard LPR with the queue name ""lp"". On NT/W2K/XP, you also need to turn on ""byte count"" or your pages get cut off.In the end, it works great and I'm glad the printing wasn't some proprietary setup. No longer does my computer need to be on for my wife to print.It does get hot on the bottom, but putting on the feet helped."
5,Simple and easy,"I didn't want to run ethernet cable around my house. I am a relative neophyte to home networking, and this package got me up and running in less than 10 minutes. I have fairly vanilla requirements so I haven't needed to get into any of the features this product has. All I wanted was some wireless access for my work applications. This has done well.I set up the router following the simple instructions and had my sister's G4 Mac securely and seamlessly surfing the net in 5 minutes (the other 5 minutes were dedicated to setting up my laptop........"
2,Too many lockups...,"I *wanted* to like this product: For the price of a similar Linksys wireless router, it also supported Appletalk and had a print server for Windows machines.Unfortunately, this device simply locked up and needed to be reset several times a day. I insured that it had the most recent version of the firmware and even tried it in a second location. However, in all cases, it needed to be reset at least once a day if not more.I'm sure there are people who are having no trouble with this unit. But gauging the number of people who are reporting these lockups, I have to say that this unit is hit or miss. I can't afford to keep missing."
3,"Great product, poor manuals.","This router works great on my Macintosh network. I've got all my desktop & laptop Macs surfing the web wirelessly, while they all print to my AppleTalk-based HP LaserJet. It's really a phenomenal piece of hardware.The problem is that the manual is mediocre (at best), and there is absolutely NO Macintosh-specific information anywhere in the manual. The Macintosh information on SMC's website is very sparse as well. So it was difficult to configure this router and get it set up initially.But once I finally got it set up (with the help of some other Mac friends [...]), and once I downloaded the firmware updater from their website... everything was just fine."
1,Think Twice,"If you want to buy SMC products, think twice:1. Their technical support never returned my email question.2. Their customer service returned my email question with an auto-reply message.3. When I bought this product, it has a rebate. But see what I got: I received the rebate cheque just one day before the cheque is void! They were lucky as I couldn't go to a bank to cash in the cheque on the EXIPRY date.All the above are TRUTH.If you still want to buy this product, I can tell you as a matter of fact, I bought two of these. One for my home, and one for my company's branch office. The product is easy to setup and is still working."
3,power supply died the first week,the 110v --> 12v (1500mA) power supply adapter died after a couple of days of use.
3,Product look great but...,there was one major problem ship with my SMC7004AWBR router. It has firmware V 1.92. This version cause lot of little problems.1. it's slow after just couple page viewed2. it seems to lock up after couple minutes of use3. it crash just before I download a big file (>25MB)I fiddled around for couple hours. Finally I went to SMC web site and found the newer firmware V 1.93. I installed it and everything works great after that.
1,Try another brand,"Got the router a week ago, set it up without any major hiccups along with a pccard/pci combo. Moved the pc downstairs, about 15 feet away from ap. No signal , no connection. Figuered it might be a firmware problem, checked the firmware but the router had the latest version already. Tried the netgear fm114p router, got a connection but link quality low and ok speeds.Manufacturers really need to start making pci cards with detached antennae so they can be arranged away from the pc. The pc acts as a sheild and blocks most of the signal. Sending the router and pci nic back and going to try a linksys wireless pci nic with the netgear and see if there is any improvements. If not, sending everything back and go back to old trusty cat5 cabling. One of the best things about Amazon (and the main reason I keep coming back) is if you buy a ... product, they make it easy to return it."
5,SMC Wireless Access Point flawless,Purchased this device over 1 month ago. Simple installation and very reliable. Have not used the print server function. Had to download new firmware upon installation to get the full range of options. Set the security to recognize certain network cards and it works great. I recommend SMC as the way to go wireless. I also have other SMC wireless network adapters connecting PC and laptop to the network. They work as descibed. Did not try other company devices. Just decided to go SMC based on reviews. I do not loose any sleep over my choice.
5,"Most functionality, best price and performance","I can't say anything but good things about this product. It required no setup whatsoever. I plugged it into my cable modem, plugged my SMC wireless card into my laptop and boom I was on the internet! It's small and looks good in my office. It has every piece of functionalty I could need. And the price was great! Best on the market!"
2,Needs a Kick every now ' n then,"1. Takes painful amount of time to detect any wireless cards. I tried this witl various different Wireless Cards - the NetGear, then the Toshiba Internal Wireless Card, etc. This definitely takes quite some time. Just cannot recognize the card on plugin.2. Needs Reboot. Well, its been over 2 months since i've had this router, n i've hard-booted it atleast 5 times. Definitely not a good standard by any means.Often, it just cannot assign an IP to even PCs or Laptops connected over the network Cable as well(not just the wireless). Initially, I wasted quite some time figuring out if there was any problem with the PCs. But on investigating, it seems to be a router problem. So every time my network goes down, I've to restart the Router n things start working.Cant say which one is better than this, cuz I've not yet seen the others, but I wont recommend this one to anybody else."
1,The Family Organizer,"This is a calender for the year 2000! Should not even be in stock, since there is no text that can provide a basis for ordering in 2001 (unless you would like to look back at the year you just finished). It should be more obvious that this is a calendar in the text description of this item!"
1,What's the point??,"I just can not understand why Amazon would be selling a organizer that is dated for the year 2000. I usually do my homework on all the books I order. THIS ONE I DIDN'T and got burned.I just assumed that it was the correct year and it wasn't!This book needs to come off the shelf and updated. And the worse thing of all, they sold it to me at full price. ... for a book that is two years old. I can't use any part of this book.Believe me, I am returning it today for a full refund!"
4,An excellent calendar for moms,"I've wasted a lot of money on numerous personal organizers and when all is said and done, this book is all you really need. You can customize it yourself with post it notes and a pocket for receipts, but all the essentials are already there. I like the ""Growth and Gratitude"" section because it addresses your inner life, beyond your hectic schedule. You can go crazy with little leather books and funky dividers, or you can buy this book and get on with your life!"
5,Required Reading For Politicians,A Street is Not a Home offers solutions to an epidemic. It has been paid too little attention. It should be required reading for every city council member in every major city in the country.
4,Good for the price,"This item was good for the price that it was bought at. Anything more expensive and I would have felt ripped off. The helmet is great and I am sure my son will use it for a long time. However, teh face mask is a little cheaply made and could use some improvement. I don't like that it came shipped without a box of its own, since it is a Christmas gift and not all that durable. My son really liked it when we saw it in the store so it was worth the money."
3,The Opposite of Fate,An OK read but a little over the edge about her mother/daughter relationship. It was an interesting window into being a Chinese/American child.
2,Where is the editor?,"I respected her work more before I read this book. Some of the essays are good and some are really bad. The worst part is the repetition. I understand that these were previously published, but couldn't someone have reworked them a little to take out the repetitive passages. I was also left confused; on the one hand she states that shed doesn't want to be pigeon holed as an Asian or Women's writer. On the other she mentions several times that she attended a conference for woman writers or Asian writers."
4,What is the opposite of fate? Self knowledge?,"I was privileged to receive an advance reader's copy of this latest book by Amy Tan. In her novels, Tan uses material culled from her own life and her family's history. But I believe this is her first nonfiction book, and in it she displays the same qualities for which her fiction is so appreciated: humor, poignancy, revelation, a little magic - and always fascination with the world and our relationships within it. In The Opposite of Fate, she reveals herself. Especially moving is a part in which she realizes she only learned who her mother really was as she was writing her obituary. A collection of ""musings,"" more than a chronological memoir, The Opposite of fate is intimate, literary, and wonderful."
3,"The good stuff is good, and the rest is...","As a few others have indicated, there are some really moving pieces here about family and memory, as well as some good looks at the life of a writer in many arenas (at the keyboard, on tour, etc.). Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to have been enough of that stuff to fill a book, and so we get a lot of filler, including e-mails that are not that riveting and the essay she wrote about the library when she was 8 (no, I'm not kidding). There is a LOT of repetition; many of these pieces were written and published previously, and that's fine, but when you sit down to edit them into a collection that hangs together, you really need to go through and make sure that things like her father's and brother's deaths, moving to Switzerland, first boyfriend, etc. are not repeated 15 times.I still love this book for the good parts, but would have been just as happy checking it out from the library."
3,Confusion,"After reading 'Wendy' I was a little confused. I thought it was good, but to me, I didn't think it was worth reading. 'Peter Pan' is supposed to be a children's book, and Karen Wallace writes 'Wendy' for young adults. In Wendy, we experience all the emotional problems Miss Wendy goes throw. She sees something that changes her life forever, which is perhaps why she chose to visit Peter in Neverland. Overall, it provided some background information about life at the Darling household that could only be supplied to the mind by imagination or this book."
3,Not What It Should Have Been,"I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the enchantment of it, but I think the author could have done so much more with it. Most of the time it just seemed like a completely different novel whose charachters happened to have the same name as the Darlings. It dragged at times, but overall it was an OK book."
1,Not for young kids or tweens.,I got this book on tape from the library to listen to on the way to school with my daughters - one of which is named WENDY due to my love of Peter Pan.The surprise began with intense adult kisses being described between 2 people married but NOT to each other. The kids they play with are abusive. Their nanny is abusive. It was not the lighthearted story of a fine heroine I was looking for. It was 5-6 tapes long and I didn't finish tape 1. The girls in my car were 10-12 years old and I was embarassed to let them listen any further. Less appropriate than Hannah Montana!
3,Navajo Weaving,This book is more about a specific collection of weavings rather than Navajo Weavings in general. Rather than assessing Navajo weavings of that period it reviews weavings within a specific collection.
3,The TNT Band on Cotique Records.,"Basically, I can't say I either like or dislike this CD. Like most albums of its time, it features a good number of Boogaloo tunes (which I honestly DON""T like) but I can't justify giving it a 1-star rating, either. The patriotic and self-explanatory ""Borinquen Bella"" is the best reason for buying this CD but the closing track ""Descarga TNT"" is pure musical dynamite and ""El Fresco"" is quite interesting. If you are a fan of 1960s Boogaloo and Latin Soul you'll probably enjoy this CD."
5,"If you dug the first Addams Family game, you'll dig this.","The spiritual successor to one of the few great licensed games of the era. If you enjoyed the first SNES Addams Family game, or if you just like side scrollers, pick up this game."
4,SKULJAGGER REVIEW,"Skuljagger is a game where you get to be a pirate and you to fight other pirates and large bugs. This is a one of a kind game because of how unique it is. One way it's unique is you can use fruit as weapons or you can use one of them as a balloon. Another way it's unique is that when you get red jewels they make your sword a better weapon by releasing what looks like tiny red fireballs. The story I believe is that you're on a journey to find Skuljagger and get his sword by defeating him. Don't go by me though on what the story is about,you'll have to play the game. One thing I am sure about though is that this game is fun and one of a kind."
5,An Original and Quirky Cozy by the Sea,"Jordan Lacy is a clever, original heroine, with a quirky approach to life. Suffering with both asthma a plethora of unsuitable men, Jordan approaches her investigative business with the methodology she learned as a police woman, and with an unorthodoxy that leaves the reader grinning. She has a double bed sit, and a box of ""props"" she uses as disguises, a love for jazz, and a love of cooking, as well as a store front cover from which she sells underpriced treasurers - Jordan is truly an original. When things are not going well, then a trip to the beach or the pier will help. The author does an exquisite job both with the setting and with allowing the reader insight into Jordan. This is a well thought out, and cunningly developed British cozy with heart beating drama on the last few pages. Enjoy!"
1,I guess you get what you pay for,"This is a well priced and attractive piece of equipment. But judging from my experience and that of some others, the quality control must be almost completely lacking. I setup my new Simpletech USB drive and backed up my entire desktop hard drive using the included software with no problem. Immediately after, my desktop stopped recognizing the drive. I tried it on my laptop with the same results. The drive was not recognized. So now I have my entire hard drive backed up on the Simpletech with no way to access or even to erase the information. Sure Simpletech will replace the drive, just send it back with all my information on it. No way. So now I'm stuck with a useless brand new piece of equipment. Beware of this brand."
5,BEWARE OF CABLE PROBLEMS,"I bought this drive and couldn't back up anything on it because I was getting ""delayed write failed"" errors. Finally switched the USB cable with another one and the problem went away."
1,Worked for about 6 months,I used this to back up pics and transfer data between old and new pc. Worked like a charm for about 6 months - then DEAD! Thank goodness I still have my files on my pc's hard drive... otherwise I would be up the creek w/o a paddle. I am going to a different brand.I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU AVOID ALL SIMPLETECH DRIVES!!!
3,Still selling noisy drives,"I thought the noise problem was fixed long ago when I bought the drive in Feb. 2006. Apparently it wasn't. Customer service was fine - immediately recognizing the problem and giving me an RMA. But it meant wiping the drive (a 4 hour process), packing, and paying $8 for shipping at my expense."
4,"Easy to setup, just plug and go","Although I haven't installed (and don't plan to use) the backup software that came with the product, this drive works excellent as a secondary hard drive. Setup was easy with Windows XP; all I had to do was plug it in. The silver casing is very ""cool"" looking, so far I am happy with the purchase."
1,Absolute junk!,"I recieved my drive. I ignored the poorly installed on/off switch. When I plugged it in, I got a bunch of error messages and my PC stopped running correctly. I called Tech support, they never tried to examine the problem, They immediately knew I ""got a bad one"" There must be a lot of ""bad ones"". I'm sending it back and bying ""good one"" from somebody else."
3,Drive does its job although a few drawbacks,"After purchasing drive for mainly storing my ridiculously large music library, I no major disappointments. Files transferred perfectly from my internal harddrive with no incompatibility or reliabily issues. One complaint i do have with this Simpletech drive is that the packaging and the website advertises this drive as being 160GB but after formating it don't expect to any more than about 149GB. I'm not sure if this misrepresentation is normal among harddrives since this purchasing one. And also the green LED light on the front that SHOULD indicate whether the drive is being accessed (reading/writing), is actually just a faint white light. This light is barely visible with the lights in the room on. This makes it hard to tell whether it is safe to remove the drive or not. Over all i am pretty satisfied with the product. Would i invest in another Simple Tech product? Well, probably not"
1,Garbage,"Desipte claims to work on win98, it doesn't.In fact, it managed to screw up other hardware on my machine."
1,Rates zero does not work for me,"Neither My Windows XP desktop (Hp) nor my IBM Thnkpad XP Laptop can recognize this drive. I downloaded drivers from Simple Tech site, tried all combinations of switching drive on before connecting, booting up both at the same time etc. Booting up the laptop with the drive connected to the USB locked up my laptop. I have spent 5 or 6 hours, and I have given up - this one sucks. The drivers on the company's web site and the documentation is also very very poor. I will not recommend this product."
1,Hard-luck drive,Terrible. Quit working after 9 months. I've been backing up data files and photos on it since last summer - now the drive is making soft clicking sounds indicating that it is dying. I'll never buy another SimpleTech product.
1,Failed after 3 months,"Installed easily under XP Pro and worked fine for 3 months. Then Windows stopped recognizing it except every once in a while. When it was recognized, the disk showed up as empty. Don't buy."
3,"Good price, some difficulties with USB connectivity","I've had this drive for a little over a month. The price was good, and I like all the space. Normally, it runs great. However, I've had some sporadic difficulties with connecting the drive to my computer. Sometimes, the computer won't recognize the drive properly, or won't disconnect properly. SimpleTech tech support says they have observed these problems only with Dell computers (I have a Dell Dimension); following their suggestions reduced but did not eliminate the problem. Also, on a couple of occasions when I've had the drive running for over a couple of hours, it has on two occasions quit responding; shutting it off for a while and then turning it back on returned to normal functioning. I'm using the drive for disaster recovery backup, so the occasional USB weirdness makes me nervous, but I'm going to stick with it for now."
4,Good Drive - cheap - but...,"The drive works well, and with Windows XP, set-ups are a breeze. The drive was plugged in and worked right the first time. I backed up my entire hard drive in about 35 minutes without using compression. I have not tried the restore feature yet, so I cannot comment on it.But...The idiot light (LED) which is supposed to show activity did not work on the first drive. I exchanged it, and guess what - the second drive idiot light did not work either. The Simple Tech teckies tell me the LED is so dim it is hard to see, and that this is a common problem for all of their 160GB drives. Well, even in the dark, the LED is ""hard"" to see. This is a real drawback since I have to use a file manager to check on whether or not the files were actually copied. Otherwise, this is one of the cheapest drives around. I paid $130CDN at Sam's Club, who also made the exchange without any questions."
4,Great hard drive for the price!!!,"This hard drive performs better than expected. The simpletech 160gb hard drive has no fan, making it very quiet. Copying my hard drive was pretty easy, but I couldn't have done it without installing the storage sync software. I think that part of the problem was that the hard drive was trying to copy the hibernation file from my computer, which didn't copy and and didn't need to be copied anyways. The storage sync software makes transferring files really easy...I recommend installing it. As others have mentioned, The ""green"" led light is actually white, and it can barely be seen when the lights in the room are off. This isn't a big deal to me because I usually look on the computer to see if files are being transfered anyways. Although there are a few minor features that could be improved on this hard drive, I would definitely buy one again."
2,I was highly disappointed,It seemed slow to save data and after less than 2 months of trying to store data on it...it crashed. I would not recommend this product and believe there are much better products on the market now. I am happy I wasn't saving anything I didn't already have backed up elsewhere.
1,It died nine days after delievery,"Don't buy this item ! (Or if you already did, don't save your important data in it.) I got my SimpleTech 160GB usb2 hard drive nine days ago and it broke today. The power switch had some problem so only LED is on but the disc doesn't run. Now I have to send it back to fix it. Since I already saved my data inside, it will be very convenient to me. So don't buy this item if you need a safe place to save your data."
1,"Despite claim of Win98SE support on box, drive won't work with 98SE","Bought this drive to use on an old system to archive data. Box says USB 1.1 compatibility with Windows 98SE, and instruction sheet refers you to the Simpletech webstite for a Windows 98SE driver, but the driver they point to doesn't work.Called Tech Support, tech told me that the drive doesn't support 98SE, and they don't have a driver available. SimpleTech updated this drive during its lifecycle, eliminating Windows 98SE support, but knowingly continued to use the old boxes and instructions claiming Windows 98SE compatibility. They are banking on the fact that few buyers still use 98SE. They apparently don't care that they are misrepresenting the product as long as they can use up the old packaging!This deserves a 0 star rating since product cost me time and money and delivered nothing. Wait, I take that back. It did teach me to not buy SimpleTech products."
1,Drive is great but the backup software is crapy and locks up,"I ordered two of these hard drives. Drives are functioning well but the backup software (Storage Sync) is not reliable at all. It took me 3 tries (15 Hours each time to backup 13 GB of data). First two times software stopped responding with no error, so I had to kill the application using Windows Task Manager. Third time it went fine, but I cannot restore any files as restore utility is keep locking on me. I have wasted all my time and gained nothing. SimpleTech support person asked me to try again with no compression (another 20 hours down the drain). He also suggested Windows backup utility. Microsoft Windows backup utility is much faster compared to the StorageSnyc and did the job in lesser time."
1,"If I could give this a zero, I would.","Bought this and plugged it in and backedup some files, went to transfer them to another computer and the drive was dead, I treid a few computers and no of them could regonize the drive. I guess I have one of the many ""bad ones"".."
2,Katharine Hepburn: Star as Feminist,"The book has interesting information, but the writing style is so convoluted it is not enjoyable to read. The photographs in the book are good reproductions."
2,data link and disc,"the programs on the disc are in spanish. the disc itself is a booted blank, unofficial thing with names written on the cover. if you can read spanish and get along with cables for a different said phone then you are cheese."
4,very pratical,This paper tray is very practical and strong. If you are looking for a paper tray for everyday use this is a good one.
2,"No Drivers, No Instructions.","I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own. The cable itself is O.K. but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it's definitely not intuitive, and definitely not plug-and-play. Support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor's website to locate the drivers on my own. Also, (and with no offense intended) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you."
1,Terrible,"DO NOT order from this company. The cable does not fit in the phone. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity. The cable came a few days late. When it arrived, the cable did not even fit. The software for the cable was defective. After it had finished installing, Windows XP came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system. Eforcity is awful."
2,Be warned,"USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand). Came with no instructions, and, if you don't have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers, you won't be able to figure this out. The driver CD is useless more or less, since they don't send you a ""product number,"" which is needed to access the menu on the CD.It works, and I am able to send files to and from my phone, but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer, and a whole lot of cursing. I won't be ordering anything from them again, and if I had it to do over, I'd order the cable from a different company."
1,It didn't work !!!,The only support I received was to send me to a competitor's homepage and try to download their software.
3,Will,The USB cable works fine but there are issues with the cd. I still have not been able to use the product.
1,Not A Custom Fit,"As others have commented: these are not a custom fit. In fact, they don't fit my Blazer very well at all. They do seem to be pretty thick and well made - they just don't fit. And for Husky to claim they're 'custom fit' is disingenuous at best."
3,Custom Fit?,Not quite as custom as expected... more of the universal type fit. They do a great job with keeping the mud and sand off the carpet.
2,Well made poor fit for a custom fit mat,"Very heavy mat, well made but when installed on my 07 focus pass side fit well, driver's side was about 2.5"" too narrow. Wide enough to keep my foot from wearing a hole in the carpet, but not enough too keep dirt/snow off carpet. I have the molded husky's on my 06 dakota they fit perfect."
4,"COOL PHONE, GAY COLOR","I bought this phone 5 months ago. It has alotof great features, and I like everything aboutit, exept the color. It's more of a pinkish red,than a cherry red. So if you're a guy like me, doyourself a favor, buy a different color!"
2,very dissapointed in sound quality,"very surprised with the 5 star ratings i saw...very cool phones, we had 2, but......even tho it had all the new features we decided we couldnt live with the poor sound quality when using it in regular talk mode..i kept finding myself saying ""what"" and ""I didnt get that"", very frustating.(sprint service)we took them back in 2 weeks and exchanged them for 2 samsungs, thats what we had before, but of course we got the new models, 680's, very very happy with them..if you want clear conversations,try them at the store, I've found almost all the samsungs to be great, our last ones gave us great service for about a year and half.for us clear phone calls are the most important feature."
4,The picture taking is the best out but the ring tones are to,I had got the 8200 for my birthday. its a great phone and all such as taking great pictures having good service and looking real good. the only bad thing about this phone is if you buy it get a extended battary pack and by a covor case because it srach up easy. instead of that its a great phone the only reason i sold it because i went and bought the treo 600. Ps the ring tones are not as loud as they should be.
5,Happiness,"This little expensive item provided happiness as a Christmas gift to my wife in 2005. It was the color of phone (regardless of manufacturer) that she had her eyes set on so that gift was an easy selection. In over a year of usage, the phone is still working great, the battery has been replaced and she is still happy. That's the bottom line."
2,"horrible ringtones, downloads bad, poor reception","i have had this phone since june. i thought it was sprint that was so awful in my house until i had friends visit from texas who had the samsung phone with sprint, and could talk on the phone for a half an hour in a spot in my house i could not even get a dial-out to go through.the download ringtones are too quiet; set at the highest volume the sound quality is bad.feature-wise, the volume settings are poor, as are the choices for the vibration/non vibration.i think the software is okay, and the screen is good. the camera is a nice one, and it looks pretty good, although the phone i think is thicker than most.i would stay away from this one, period."
2,horrible clarity,"when you talk to someone else who has a sanyo phone, the clarity is horrible. my phone chipped in one corner (not from being dropped), and now it wont charge. i have had this phone for only 8 months. the battery life is also not great at all. the phone jumps from 3 bars to 1 in a short amount of time."
1,Won't charge period!,"I have had this p hone for 9 months, and know someone else who had it for 9 months with this same problem. When plugging in the phone to charge it beeps like its plugging in then 5 minutes later it will beep as if I am un plugging it. Come morning my phone battery hasn't even charged period. So now they are sending me a new phone sinces its still on its warranty. Nonetheless its really annoying!"
1,"great phone, but you can't hear anything","I loved this phone, I got it in red and my husband in silver.I loved everything about this phone, the menu system and the internet and addresss book were GREAT! BUT.... We had to return these for different phones after a week, because you couldn't understand a word of what someone was saying to you through the phone, the audio quality was TERRIBLE. Other people could hear us fine though, and even with the signal level at maximum, you couldn't understand what people were saying. The store assured us that the phones were not defective (both had the same problem anyway) so we changed for another phone, which, although not as cool, you could hear well."
3,Ringers,"Like the product a lot. Think a phone for this much should have a few of it's own ring tones, though. So you don't have to pay for a different one.Love the red color. Got a blue one for Hubby. The speaker is great. Love the voice dial, had it with last phone. Wouldn't have phone without it."
1,"Gifford Genealogy, 1626-1896",Very disappointed in the information relayed in this book. Lots of the information was not connected properly and there was little to help with any research I had hoped to further with this book. Very little helpful information added to the people to tell anything about them.
4,Beep Pt 2,"I Like the Pussycat Dolls, especially Nicole. This CD ""Beep Pt 2"" I purchased it for my son, since he likes the the group so much."
5,Pcd rocks,"In response to the fat dude who wrote the last review dude u're an idiot, these girls are the sexiest group this year & in a while overall this may not be their best song but it is stil good.I'm sure u can't sing & i know u don't look as hot as melody so ppl looking to buy this cd i'd advise against it cuz heey it only has on 1 song but their album P.C.D. is excellent."
1,They need to get the BEEP out of the music business,I sofa king hate the Pussycat dolls. They can't sing. They look uglier than I did in 2003 when I weighed over 500 pounds. They need to quit the music business NOW!
2,Long Awaited Flop,"I'll keep it pithy: Picture publisher 9 is a half-baked clone of 8, and some will surely say it's an inferior rip-off. Not only does it lack the latest refinements that its competitors offer, it has problems in Windows ME (It doesn't see a lot of folders when searching for a picture). If you have 8, which is a wonderful program, hold on to it. If you're starting fresh, go with Corel Photo Paint or Adobe."
2,Terribly written,The only good thing I can say about this horribly written book is that the author's love of her subject comes through.If only she could write! It sounds like an 8th graders school report. I don't understand how she continues to be published - she's been gracing bookstore shelves with her inept writings for years now...her subjects deserve better.Buy Sarah's records and let the music speak for itself.
4,A great Amazon find,"Off beat movie about some teens on their own. They get out of hand with their attempts to make money to survive. Maybe Griffin's first movie. Good acting by some start up actors. A good lesson in what not to do to make it in this world. They are given some opportunities but, blow it in the end."
4,Still contemporary after all these years,"This is the only game in town if you want to see classic Japanese Bunraku short of a trip to Japan. This performance is abridged, and there are no long shots that allow you to take in the whole minimalist staging of singer, musician, and puppeteers, but the essence of the form is still engaging. The play by Chikamatsu is best presented in English by the Donald Keene translation and commentary (also avialable at AmazonThe Major Plays of Chikamatsu, and I recommend the book as a libretto for enhancing the viewing of the video. Keene does a very good job of clarifying the historical context of Chikamatsu's work in a way that reinforces the timeless nature of the Bunraku art, and he even makes a pretty good stab at translating Chikamatu's puns and clever Japanese language that is missed in the video sub-titles."
4,"The world of the author, with laughter instead of tears","This book is wonderful. It made me laugh instead of cry. As a beginner in the publishing world, we often feel frustrated and discouraged. Blythe and Cook make jokes about silly things beginner writers do, turning the whole breaking-the-ice game into laughter. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and even though I am still back at the same place with query letters and the rest, at least now, I feel like I am bit smarter and a bit happier. Thanks for this great book."
1,Useless,"Maybe it's just me, but I'm tired of these writing cookbooks--""Get your novel published in ten easy steps!"" This one, ""Your Novel Proposal...,"" is just another one in a long line of false works that proffer quick-n-easy routes to success as a writer. Unless you are truly a novice writer who has been living in a closet for the past ten years and don't know the basics of writing a query letter or a synopsis, this book will prove useless to you. As Hemingway said, ""If you want to be a writer, write."" I've read dozens of these books, including this one, and have them on my shelves to prove it; still, Hemingway's advice has shown itself to be more true than I ever realized. Stop reading these ""how-to"" books and just keep writing. Write, submit, and keep writing. My question for the authors of these books who are agents is this: ""Why aren't you spending your time reading manuscripts to find the next John Grisham?"" Thanks for reading this."
4,Some of the best Subtitle to date,"Wow. So Gino has finally come up, no longer selling CD-R copies of ""Delete the Elite"" out of his backpack, but still keeping it underground. This record is challenging, pushing the boundaries of what you might normally call hip-hop. Subtitle wouldn't have it any other way. When he recorded this album, he was living in an 8x8 studio with no windows, deciding that the music was more important than an apartment. It shows. The beats are crazy, including one that was done on Nanoloop (software that lets you make beats on a Gameboy). If you've caught his live act, you know he is crazy, and talented. Buy the record. It will change your views on hip hop."
5,NO ACCIDENT,This is one of great hard rock and metal albums ever recorded. The songs are very strong throughout and the guitarists - Roy Z and Adrian Smith - contribute some fine riffs and solos. This is Bruce Dickinson's second best solo album. Thoroughly recommended.
3,A mixed bag (more like 3.5 stars),"Bruce fans looking for a cohesive album will probably want to start with Chemical Wedding.Accident of Birth is an eclectic collection of songs, some good, some bad. The album's strong songs include the killer opener Freak, the Soundgardenesque Starchildren, the epic Darkside of Aquarius, the sludgy Welcome to the Pit, and the proggy Omega.Unfortunately there are some very poor songs on here, such as Road to Hell, Accident of Birth, and the many cheesy ballads like Taking the Queen, Man of Sorrows, and Arc of Space. I'm on the fence with The Magician, which is catchy despite the stupid lyrics, and the Maidenesque Ghost of Cain.In short, when the album is good, it's very good, but when it's bad, it's very bad. Choose for yourself."
5,No ACCIDENT at all...,"Dickinson delivers another stunning collection of songs and shows the world why Iron Maiden has never be the same without him. Brutal, electrifying, heavy, numbing, adventurous, brilliant. Dickinson's song writting and vocal talents bleed through on every track.The bonus cd give listeners an insight to the evolution of a handful of songs with demo versions, and for Man Of Sorrow there is an orchestal, a radio edit, and a spanish version which shows how many different directions this song can go and still hold up.Great job of remastering, great packaging, cool new art work. A must for any metal head."
4,Excellent reissue... BUT...,"Normally I hate remasters since they always sound worse due to added compression, but the Bruce Dickinson discography luckily sounds just as good as the original releases. Accident of Birth is an excellent album and has been getting heavy rotation on my CD player. It's a 5 star album and this is a 5 star reissue. So why is only 4 stars?Because they messed up big time by putting Ghost of Cain on disc 2. I know this is just a minor error but on the original reissue it came after Welcome to the Pit. Here it's on Disc 2 all of a sudden. Anyways that aside it's a total 5 star reissue, and the Spanish version of Man of Sorrows is excellent.On a side note- If you disagree with a certain part of my review or if I make a typo, PLEASE comment on it, and don't vote ""No"". It's pissing me off. If you disagree with it completely, then you can vote no. But otherwise... you know."
5,Goooood Chicken,"If you want to get a different taste in chicken, this is the way to go. Online there are many different rubs and ways to season the chicken - gooood chicken."
3,A Fake???,"This CD has some good songs on it, Such as ""Welcome to the Jungle"" by Guns N' Roses, and ""Back in Black"" by ACDC. At first everything sounds great, but after listening to the songs a few times, you begin to realize that they don't really sound like they should. After realizing this, I decided to find out for sure, I grabbed a Guns N' Roses CD from my collection, and compared the two versions of ""Welcome to the Jungle"". Quite apparently, the song on what I had thought to be a CD with a great combination of some good songs, was not authentic. It was not Guns N' Roses. As a matter of fact, ""Back in Black"" sounds sort of like Jimi Hendrix trying to imitate Brian Johnson (ACDC's lead vocalist). So I recommend this CD, as long as you are not depending on the actual versions of the songs."
4,"How To Study and Take Exams, by Lincoln Pettit","Although I'm Mrs. Lincoln Pettit, objectively speaking, I believe my husband's book is valuable for new college students or even high school students who want to learn how to economize time and efforts in meeting challenging courses yet have time for social activities.I think some of his comments are dated with regard to women's attitudes toward a college degree, his recommendations for taking notes, scheduling time and developing a healthy attitude toward school are very valuable, however.He was a popular speaker among fraternities and sororities at Michigan State University on this subject."
3,I didn't fall in love,"Miller seems to be a man of great elegance, but somewhere along the way the plot got forgotten. Whereas his first novel, Ingenious Pain, was an original and surprising ""bibliography"" of a man that never was, this portrait of a real historical character seems to be more shallow and not very inspiring. Three stars for Miller's brilliant style; this time, the substance doesn't satisfy."
5,astonishing,"This is a very different book than Miller's first, Ingenious Pain, but just as brilliant. A comic tale about an aging Casanova, the woman he pursues and her harridan female relatives who harass him, it is alive with vibrant visceral and emotional details. This book shows Miller's range, and confirms that he is a novelist of original expression and talent. This book is even better the second time you read it."
3,Not as good as the original,"I bought this product through Amazon, because I was using one already, and really liked it, but the ones I ordered, while from the same company, were not of the same quality as the one I had. The plastic bottle parts broke and leaked after only a short time, and the spouts were a hard plastic rather than a soft one like my original, nearly broke a front tooth! The outside covers were very similar to the original, and seem to work as well keeping the bottle cool. I would not recommend the new version of this product, but if you can find one that is of the original quality, buy it!"
2,The bottle sucks,"The insulating wrap works, it keeps the bottle cold. But the bottle cap sucks, breaks very easily. The company replaced the cap for me, but it broke very quickly. So, I only use the insulating wrap with another bottle."
1,This Bites,"I really enjoyed their previous album (Matinee Idols), but this one is a collection of very boring poppy songs that never go any where and feature very uninspired jams. I am tremendiously disappointed."
2,Not Up to Snuff,"Recently, I purchased my first Pod music. If you are a fan of quality musicianship, inventive improvisation, and good songwriting, you should look somewhere else. The Pod purchase was a mistake. Its better than commercial radio, but I hate to damn with faint praise. The playing is nothing special, the songs are not catchy, and there is no apparent interplay between the musicians. I understand the Pods can be quite a riot to see on stage (a la Frank Zappa), but the resemblance ends there. If you like bands like the Dead, Allman Bros., SCI, LoS, Phish, save your ticket money. You don't need this one. Mine is going to the used music store."
1,the usual feminist literature-very biased and anti-male,"With her daughter in tow, judy mann sees the world from only one perspective, the female. Her research is almost ridiculous..she blames a little girls passivity on how her father holds her. Mann becomes angry discussing how fathers in India favor male children, yet lauds the role of women years ago who decided whether a child should live or die...Mann finishes her book by mentioning how in pre-history women led society in a ""Vision Quest"" what ever that is. a totally useless book."
1,more feminist propaganda,"if this is like her other books I would urge readers not to pick this up. Judy Mann is a highly biased writer, who sees only one perspective, her own."
1,Judy Mann a highly biased author,"Judy Mann is a extremely biased writer, while professing to see both sides of gender relations she maintains that women are the perpetual victims of men, according to Mann a woman has the right to abort her child, but when a male insists on that right he is considered a chauvenist."
3,Works as advertised but not in optical splitter also on Amazon,Works just fine but doesn't work well with the Toslink Optical Splitter also available on Amazon.
3,Good For A Low Budget Sci-Fi Movie,"Virtual Assassins is about an ex-cop turned janitor, at a high-tec research building, that gets over run by cyber terrorists. Dudikoff is good as the hero. A must see for Dudikoff fans, aswell as Sci-Fi Fans."
3,a so-so sci-fi movie.,"while i am a fan of michael dudikoff, this movie was mediocre. it had the potential for so much more."
1,This tea is the worst,"I love tea and am very much a connoiseur.Revolution tea is the worst available. I've tried several varieties of Revolution tea when the local tea shops sold it and all the varieties are gross. Most of the coffee/tea shops here no longer sell it.Numi, Republic of Tea and Good Earth all have fine quality teas that I recommend instead of this water pollution."
3,"Great tea, but this pack is not a bargain.","This is the best bagged black tea, bar none. It's very similar to high-quality loose tea, but more convenient. However, Revolution Tea sells 16-count packs (one more bag) for $4.99 each on their site (and in some grocery stores, if you are lucky). Six packs X $5 per pack would be $30, less than the ""sale"" price here and far less than the supposed regular price, which has no basis in reality. Including shipping, the price might be similar (the site sometimes offers free shipping), but it's not the incredible bargain that the price claim would indicate."
5,Future Golf Pro,"I bought the left handed clubs for my granddaughter. They are very nice for a starter set. Well made, nice loft. The bag is good quality. For the price point, they are the nicest set I saw."
1,wrong stuff,The box and the order were for right handed clubs. Inside the box were left handed clubs. Problem.
4,Should be one more club,Great for a 7 year old to begin golf so he can soon go out with his grandpa. Should be one more club - fairway wood to make the set a bit more complete. Grandson was thrilled. Good value
3,dont like the bag it comes with,"clubs are nice, the bag is very cheap and collapses. will buy another golf bag for my son to use, other than great. nice kit"
3,Not what I expected...,"This DVD is much more basic than I expected. When you think of the basic dance steps, multiply that by beginner x 10. You wouldn't be able to dance a song with the limited steps they give you in this DVD. It has some good starting points, but there is no way my fiancee & I could learn to tango for our first dance, from this DVD."
4,Review of Options made Easy,I have read about 1/3 of the book and have learned a lot. Great book for a novic elike me. It teached you about Options and also about the market in general. Easy good explanations.
2,It is not a understandable OPTION book,"As a professional trader, I do not suggest this book for beginners. This book does not have a good explanation for beginners. It is good for people who have experience and want to learn more about option. My suggestion for beginners is to read OPTIONS DEMYSTIFIED (by Thomas McCafferty) first to get a clue about options and then read option made easy book. The book (OPTION DEMYSTIFIED)I mentioned has a great explanation for beginners. It is easy to read and understand. The writer did a great job to make it as easy as possible."
3,A book or a commercial?,"It seems about 1/2 of the book is an introduction to technical analysis..the rest is great if you ignore the author's 'commercials' for his web site, software and services."
1,Not for a novice! It's a difficult read filled with jargon.,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I thought it was written for people with little knowledge of options. It has many confusing charts & analysis & written with terms that are not part of the average persons financial vocabulary. I will go out to by a ""dummies"" book. It was a complete waste of time."
4,A Great Book for Amateur Trader,"This is so far the best option trade book I read. It's easy to understand and follow. For the strategies discussed, it gave clear reasoning for entry and risk/reward analysis. It is the best one for a beginner in option trading."
5,Superb,This was an excellent guide to both understanding and applying option strategies. The additional technical information was very informative and enabled one to grasp a thurough understanding of the risks and rewards associated with options depending on their implementation. Well done !
1,CHARTS NOT LEGIBLE IN KINDLE FORMAT,Do NOT buy this book in the Kindle format. I started reading the Kindle edition of this book. The author starts out by telling you how important the charts and tables are in the book. Well when I got to the first chart I noticed that it is ENTIRELY illegible in the Kindle format. Obviously Kindle either needs to increase the size of the Kindle screen and the resolution for this type of book or at least tell you that the very important charts and tables are illegible in the Kindle format.
3,Lukewarm,"Book begins by assuming reader has little to no knowledge of the subject, but then moves to advanced level by end of book. Many trading strategies were examined, which is a good thing, but there were many simple trading strategies left out. I learned this by reading Cramer's most recent book ""Getting Back to Even"" which has its very own chapters dedicated to option trading. Got more out of those chapters from Cramer than I did from Cohen's entire book."
2,I cannot suggest this book with a clear heart.,"I was too harsh on this book in my first review. After reading it twice, I will give it 4.... stars instead of two. Read this book along with other books also.This book is a must in Options education. The author touches on subjects others miss. Look at David Caplan also."
3,Ok Elementary-Intermediate Book,"""Options Made Easy"" is a good book to start off with if you have no experience with Options, but still have lots of experience trading stocks. Author Guy Cohen does a good job of introducing definitions and backing them up with examples.The book falls a little short in a few places. This first is the writing style, where Guy expects the reader to have a good understand of trading jargon. Second, in some parts of the book he uses a particular term that isn't defined until later in the book. An author should never use a term until after is has been defined. And finally, the book does a good job of defining different techniques, but does little to say what trades situation are good; ones that he would invest in.Thus I can only give this book 3 stars out of 5. Still, it's a good starting place if you are new to options."
4,Options made a little easier.,"This book did a decent job of explaining some of the basics and then some less advanced techniques when it comes to options strategies and hedging. The graphs were helpful. I would have liked to see more real world examples and how these different strategies play out. I gave the book an above average rating because I thought it was a decent technical book, which I like, vs. other boods that I've read where there is more fluff and useless stories of the authors big wins etc. I would recommend this book to someone with a little experience in options who wants to take the next step. There are probably books out there that are better for the more advanced strategies that one can use with options."
1,very displeased!!,No Quality in this item. A lot of missing pages. whats with this? There are pages with great info. What is this doing to the author? Please strive to get it right or dont sign your name to it.
4,"Apik untuk pemula, good for beginners","Bukune apik, untuk tingkat pemula, good for beginners, with detail explantions, but still need in depth about special tricks in difficult conditions."
5,Great Book to bring you up to speed,"If you are new to options, this will be a good start. I own over 40 books on options and this was one of the first that I purchased and I still peruse it from time to time."
4,A picture you'll love. Speakers? Not so much.,"With component video, DVI, VGA, and S video inputs, this monitor can replace a computer monitor AND television. I have a DirecTV HDTV receiver hooked up to it and love, love, LOVE it. The image is blur-free, bright and crisp. The color saturation is spot on and easy to adjust should you care. I play World of Warcraft, and this monitor can accomodate the 1650x1080 screen resolution like a champ!The downsides are few, but good to know. The speakers are weak and lack range. Even when adjusted at their best, they are tinny. Most people I know who need great sound don't rely on any device's built-in speakers, but these could have been a little bit better in my opinion. Also, while having an awesome tilt adjustment, it doesn't have a height adjustment. Ergonomics are not dismissable anymore.Overall, this is a great monitor if you're prepared to deal with it's minor imperfections. I was, and consider myself lucky to own one."
1,it will break,"I have two Westinghouse LCM-22w2 monitors of which both are dead just after the warranty was over. One stopped working while it was under warranty (customer service is very bad, they told me that because I used it in my home office the warranty did not cover it because I was using it for commercial applications and that was not covered under warranty) and Westinghouse sent me a new replacement but it has stopped working now as well. I have learned my lesson, let Westinghouse stick to making power plants because they cant seam to make decent electronics."
2,It's fairly nice; until the power supply goes on you...,"This monitor is decently crisp and bright, even if the color depth leaves something to be desired (I was sometimes told of subtleties in an image online others could view easily but I could not until I viewed it on my laptop - yes, my laptop LCD screen was much better in this regard).But, while mine lasted ~2 years before developing serious backlight and power problems, it turns out I was luckier than most. When mine started to die, I researched this model and learned that it's plagued with power supply issues which result in premature death.It's a fixable problem, but not for the layman.I would generally stay away from this model of monitor unless you get it VERY inexpensively (say, $50 or less). It's not worth much more, since you WILL have problems with it sooner than you should, unless you're very, very lucky."
4,I love underground metal!!,Great album! Love the transition of his voice. Props on guitars for Testicularfavorite tracks are:BloodwakeTesticularBorn of the Deadtide
5,This book is wonderful! Couldn't put it down!,"Before reading this book, I had never read romance. Now I'm hooked. The plot is enthralling, the details excelent, and the hero is one every girl can fall for!"
1,"How I Spent My Summer Vacation, Looking for Pirate Women...","That should have been the title of the book. I was really disappointed. There was very little about Grace O'Mally, and more about what she did on her vacation.I really didn't care why she changed her name or where she stayed or that she got sick and couldn't go row-boating. I just wanted to know about women's roles at sea, which she did cover a bit, but she could have done in a 100 page paperback instead."
1,Totally Misleading,"I am more than a little interested in historical accounts of piracy, especially those dealing Grace O'Malley, and other female mariners. I selected this book hoping for more stories of the same, and was instead bored to tears by the author's accounts of her trip, the countryside, the places she stayed.. On and On. I got no new information about Grace or anyone else. It seemed like the author did not find enough information about these ""legendary women"" and needed to pad the book with her adventures. I personally would reccomend ""She Captians"" or Anne Chambers biography of Grace O'Malley over this book."
4,Try it.,"Maybe this is one of the lesser known books on the Western Mystery Tradition; I was lucky find a reprint in a discount bookstore over a decade ago. Published some time ago, before the New Age 'explosion', its presentation isn't showy, and it doesn't pretend to provide all the 'secrets'. What it does do, however, is provide a serious introduction Western Magical thought outlining the psychological and philosophical foundations of the movement - as Butler notes in the endnote, sometimes with a tantalising lack of specific detail - but you can be sure that what you read here is written for the right reasons. Read in conjunction with The Magician: His Training and Work, by the same author."
4,My favorite green tea!,"The pouch is vacuum sealed and holds about 100gms of delicate, deep-emerald, leaves. I use about a tsp for a 12-16oz cup. It is very important to avoid using boiling water if you want to get the full benefits and flavor of this tea. Water at a rolling boil will overcook the tea and you will notice that the tea quickly turns brown in the cup. If you adhere to directions and use water at 80 deg. C., you will be left with a wonderful cup of GREEN tea that stays green. I absolutely love the fresh, grassy flavor of this tea and it is a wonderful pick-me-up. The first sip of this tea leaves a distinctly sweet note on the tongue even though there is no actual sugar in the tea! I have spent hundreds on different teas, but I keep returning to this one as my staple."
3,Good tea,I've tried various Japanese and Chinese teas in the past and this one tastes good. I think it's a little overpriced given the quality of the tea.
2,Ive had better,"I may be bias because I lived in Japan and drank real Japanese green tea. This stuff is no good. It's very bitter. It's all I have right now to drink so I will drink it but I will never buy it again. The Rashi Sencha is sooo much better then this. This tea is mostly small broken up bits of leaves. I don't see a full leaf anywhere. It brews weak. The caffeine content is not so strong either. Get the Rashi Sencha, tastes better and you can re brew it a few times and it still tastes good, not like this stuff."
1,not a good tea,"It doesn't taste like green tea, maybe a little bit like gemaicha? I don't like this tea, and throw away it to trash after drinking several cups. Not sure what reason, I felt dizzy and discomfortable after drinking it. Don't buy it."
3,Rich and vibrant colors come alive in the story of a young wood-carver,"This story of a young boy who breaks from tradition in his small village in Oaxaca to create the woodcarvings of his dreams is beautifully illustrated. The rich and vibrant colors come alive, as do the vivid images of goats, birds and cougars, as dreamed, and later carved by the main character of the story. The interesting part about this story is that it is inspired by a visionary wood-carver, named Manuel Jimenez who, it is claimed, helped revitalize the woodcarving industry in that region.DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
3,Great Idea with Apple's Horrific earbuds,"I used the lanyard during workouts and while the concept is ideal, Apples' ear buds are terrible. The sound quality is lacking and the Apple's ear buds are notorious for not fitting. The ear buds just kept falling out with every move of my attached 2G Nano. I do not recommend the lanyard for anyone wishing to use theses for exercising."
2,"Great idea, TERRIBLE quality!","Decided that the 4th replacement was the last. GREAT idea, but so poorly made that they only last about 4-6 months before they break (one side or the other looses sound.) Cheaply made, too fragile for constant use. Too bad Apple can't get these right. Maybe that's why they don't make them for the new 3G version! Wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so expensive to start out with!"
5,Works great,I use it for running and tuck it under my shirt; it holds the ipod tight so I'm very happy with it.
4,Needs better earbuds,"This is a good product that could be great with a few adjustments.First of all, they should be absolutely clear that this only fits the 2nd generation Nano. This will not fit the 1G Nano (the one with the shiny metal back). Also, the earbuds they used are the earbuds that everyone hates. I wish they made this lanyard with the flexible rubber ""In-Ear"" headphones which fit perfectly. This is available for the 1G Nano, but not the 2G for some reason.On the plus side, the lanyard is great for exercising. The part that goes around the neck is adjustable and you can run with it on without too much hassle (although I tend to tuck it in my shirt if I am running).I tried using the Nano armband, but the headphone cables go all over the place when you have it on. Jogging on a treadmill with the armband is a nightmare. On the other hand, cable management is great with the lanyard. You barely notice the cables at all."
2,"Written for history buffs, not travellers","If you want a painstakingly detailed historical background of every paving stone and ...bowl in the gorgeous country that is Turkey, this is your book.If you want practical, up to date and streetwise info on where to stay, eat, hangout or party, this is NOT what you want! ... Even the maps stink."
4,Cutting Edge,"Let me start out with how much I like Danger Girls! Christopher Hart is one of my favorite American comic book artist of all times! The different views of heads, hands, and feet are very helpful! The one, two, and three point perspective section of the book is very cool! I love this one!"
2,Nice pictures but not much else.,I bought this book because I saw it in a book store and liked the style of work in it. Ive been drawing and painting for years. The art is everybit as good as mine or better but as far as a learning book or a book teaching you how to acomplish these works it is lacking. Its an ok book for anyone who doesnt like to read. because theres not much reading or explaination in it. Its all sort of look and guess. Its also lacking variations in characters of other races/nationalities. Im glad I bought it used and not new.
3,Something's missing,"Although this book shows some good examples, I find that it is lacking somewhat. There's a feel of a rush job here. It's good for quick references, such as how to draw a face from different angles, et. al.I don't quite agree with the section on composition. He's trying a bit too hard to make everything ""cutting-edge"" that he forgets the idea of story-telling. This results in his pages a bit over-done. Perhaps he should read Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art.One section that confuses me is the part on animation. That shouldn't be in this book since this is supposed to be about comics. Personally, to some extent, the animation section is a waste of space.I could summarize the gist of this book: To attain cutting-edge, exaggerate!If you're looking for a book that is more of a picture reference, get this book (See first paragraph). But I would suggest Will Eisner's books for better in-depth story-telling lessons."
3,I would have liked it.,"This is a pretty cool book and i think i can learn a lot if not for the drawings that are cut out of the middle. That pissed me off. I was psyched that i got a cool book about drawing but then i find one important section just cut out. I mean, WHO DOES THAT! who cuts out pictures from an instructive drawing book. And then tries to sell it."
4,Pre-Review,"I just skimmed over the preview of a few pages of the book(as Amazon offers for no charge), picked up my sketchbook, and started sketching out the male/female templates. It was very easy for me. I also got a completely original look on both sketches. I don't like to try to conform my style to others'. Anyway, I like art. I like portraits. And I like comics. So why shouldn't this be hard to pick up? If the results from the preview were satisfied me, then I'm definitely going for the whole thing."
1,Cutting Edge? Not so much...,"The comic book equivalent of ""extreme"" sports. While comic book figures are obviously drawn ""larger than life,"" this book takes that technique well over the top. If you're not distracted by recurring illustrations of women with proportions which don't remotely resemble reality (augmention notwithstanding), you won't mind this book.Instead, I recommend Hart's books ""How to Draw Comic Book Heroes and Villains"" for a less ""extreme"" treatment of his method, and ""Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy"" for general guidelines on drawing the human figure without a live model, and checking the proportions of your subject by ""internal"" reference.Others have suggested ""How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way"" (1978) instead, and I concur. I also highly recommend ""The DC Comics Guide to Inking Comics"" by Klaus Janson (2003) as a companion volume.Make sure you look at this one in the bookstore before deciding to buy it."
1,Does not deliver,"This book is a ... , trust me when I tell you that you will learn very little out of it , it has lots of pretty samples but it is not enough to teach , there are no tutorials , no step by step and hardly any informative text . For example the coloring section shows the inks and then the finished colors next to it - that's it .You can learn just the same by looking at comics , I was very disappointed from this book . ..."
2,Could use more metro coverage,"While advertised as DC, VA, and MD, the only parts of the latter two states are the regions immediately adjacent to the District, which does not even include the main metro airport Dulles in VA. I would pass on purchasing this and go for something *slightly* more comprehensive."
5,Another great title that was overlooked,Here we have another great game that was vastly overlooked by the gaming community in the early 90's. The only thing I can think of for it not having the success it should have had is I believe it was ahead of it's time. shooters(with guns) didn't catch on until well when Golden Eye 007 was made then everything shifted in that direction. a great game to play and collect and affordable for around $15 dollars.
3,"This game is fun, but you need a strategy guide or a lot of time","A classic no doubt, but the figuring out who to talk to and what to do is hardly worth it. Well it is if you use the internet to figure it out also the game you find yourself constantly shooting the same enemies over and over again to get levels and money for weapons. I would give this game a 4 stars since it can really get you into the game and the environment is strange to say the least. Odds are if you aren't using a walkthrough you will most likely give up before you beat it."
5,STERLINGTEK's batteries RULL,When it comes to batteries for CANON SLR system this is the way to go... They are one third of the price compared to the CANON battery and they work as good if not better. This is the way to go.
4,Working good. Hope they can keep up in the lon g run,"I had had a couple after market BP511 already. But they all die out after a year of use. I've had these for like a month, shotting a couple events and they are working as good as the original. Hope they can hold up in the long run so I don't have to constanly buying new batteries!"
3,Canon Battery,Not quite as reliable as Canon batteries but for the price they served the purpose. I wouldn't count on these second party batteries when not able to recharge on daily basis (places where AC power is not available for several days). But for most shoots these are good to have in my bag as back up.
2,Basically worthless,"I bought these to replace the original (6 year old) OEM battery in a Canon 5d. The reviews here and elsewhere were mostly positive about the SterlingTek brand of BP-511's, relative to the competition. Maybe I got a pair of duds, who knows? What I do know is that each battery is good for around 100 shots, and they go from full charge to empty rather quickly.I'm not terribly surprised with the outcome. In my experience third-party batteries generally have a much wider range of quality than OEM batteries. You might get one that outperforms an OEM, or you might get a lemon."
3,There is no miracle,"I bought this two batteries after reviewing many users. It seems it must have nice performance to have such recommendations.Unfortunately, the two copies I had are not good. The size is OK when insert to the trunk, but little shorter when hook with battery tray (you need a elastic ring). The worse thing is the capacities is far less than its statement, 2000mAh. I feel it's only have half of my 4 years old OEM one.Very disappoint. I used have one third party battery on my 50D, there is no difference with these two.No miracle. Except the capacities, I have no idea how bad they are. You get what you pay."
5,2 batteries for less than the price of 1,Normally I stick to the the old adage that you get what you pay for. Well in this case I took a gamble and I'm pleasantly surprised. These batteries are high quality and work great with my 50D camera. I'm very happy with them and their performance is just as good as the original Canon battery.
5,Great Batteries!,I priced these batteries at a local battery store and it was going to be around $80 EACH! I am glad I found them on this website because they were cheap and they lasted a whole shoot (300 plus pics and I still have life left in them!)!!
5,Can't Tell Difference,"Can't tell the difference. These work just as well as the original ones, but cost a fraction of the price. Thanks SterlingTek!"
5,STK's Canon BP-511 Battery,So far so good! Even if these last half what the Canon's last I'll be better off than purchasing the OEM's. Two batteries for less than half the cost of one Canon? We'll see but right off I'm hopeful. Batteries holding full charge after 3 weeks on first go round.
4,Fits and works like it should... So far.,"I charged both batteries once they arrived and I suspect they had a charge already since it only took about 20 minutes to fully charge them. They fit exactly like the genuine Canon batteries except they lack the brand name on the back. I've only had them for a week and I finally did my first major photoshoot with the batteries and they seem to be holding up just fine. I suppose they might not last as long as the real thing but they also don't cost nearly as much. I say for $25 USD they're certainly a bargain, well worth it even as spares."
5,"A+ great items, would buy again!!!","Item arrived as described, works well, holds a charge for a long time. Get rid of those old tired batteries and replace with these! A+"
5,Just as Good,"Our batteries for our cameras were getting old and not holding charge. We bought these on a whim, figured they couldn't be worse than the old ones we had and continue to be amazed by them. They hold a charge, stay strong for hours, work great. No different from Canon batteries, fit great, work well. No complaints!"
1,I hope nobody intends to defend his/her life with this.,"If you want to read about handgun defense, look for books and articles by Ayoob, Applegate, Fairbairn, Cirillo, etc. Nothing in this book is conducive to realistic defense of one's life.Hatsumi's books (at least those published in English) seem geared more for the overly impressionable young teenager than for mature people who are aware of the realities of the modern world. I've practiced Eastern martial arts and dabbled in Western combat concepts for several years, and I've seen how inadequate Hatsumi's notions are in the face of modern combat realities. If you're hanging out with asian-style martial artists who will give you a dojo type of fight, you might do okay. But you're looking for the skills and frame of mind to cope with life in the big bad city, don't waste your time with this irrelevant nonsense."
2,Did not work,"I got this for two North Face jackets that had lost their waterproofing. It did not work for either. For the first 10 minutes or so in the rain, the water kinda beaded up, but after that the rain was soaked through the fabric. This stuff DOES NOT WORK and I'm extremely disappointed."
4,spray water off,"while looking for way of protection from water treatment came upon Nikwax spray,it is ofcourse easy to use and seems to enhance the water repellent of my rainsuit"
4,Nikwax,use this to touch up my waterproof hunting and outdoor gear. Does what its suppose to do. Easy and simple and adds water repeling properties back tothe fabric.
2,Disappointing results,"Saw lots of good reviews here and elsewhere, so I was hopeful this would be the solution for my 14-year-old Gore-Tex jacket. The jacket had been completely waterproof up until the last year or so. Tried Nikwax and followed the directions exactly. Went out in a rainstorm the next week and the jacket was no more waterproof than it was before I treated it."
5,spray,Worked great got this product to use on our motorcycle gear worked great and last a long time great price
2,Disappointed,"I bought this product after my LL Bean Tec2 rain coat got soaked in Europe. The coat is quite old and was never put to the test in a severe rainstorm until I was overseas. I searched on line and discovered that Gore tex products do loose their effectiveness over time. I also found that people who experienced this type of failure suggested this product. Long story made short, it helps a little, but I wouldn't stand out in the pouring rain for long because the water does soak through after a while. Maybe it's my jacket, but for me the product didn't work very well."
5,No time to wash in? Just spray on!,"I have been a Nikwax user for a few years, but I have usually used the wash in products for my waterproof jackets/pants. The day before a big hike the weather forecast turned from worse to foul and I considered replacing my aging jacket that day, but while shopping a salesman told me to try the spray in formula as I didn't have enough time to use the wash in formula. The only advice he gave me was that I needed to follow the directions to a ""T"" to get the results I wanted. Anyway I sprayed my jacket that night and by morning it was good to go and kept me dry for an 18 mile deluge in the Cascade Mountains. Great alternative to the wash in formulas!"
5,Information you won't find anywhere else,"This book is a collection of essays written between December 2000 and January 2003. The essays cover a wide range of topics, including propoganda in the U.S. media, the role of Sun Myung Moon in the current administration, global arms trade, the CIA international death squad, the relationship between the House of Saud and al Qaeda, Draconian government practices since 9/11, and the overarching role of oil in U.S. foreign policy. These essays were not written for entertainment purposes but to reveal the realities of life here and abroad since the Bush administration came to power. Quite simply, you will find here information that you will not find anywhere else. Very little of it is pleasant, but I challenge anyone to refute the facts presented by these two noted researchers."
5,What's the Point?,"Like the guy above, screaming ""Lies!"", I also haven't read this book. I don't need to. Neither should anyone. It is plain as day that the authors have hit the nail on the head with this one and most unfortunately, there isn't a god damn thing anyone of us can do about it. It's just too late as everyone will find out. I sure am glad I left the country years ago. At least my kids will know what freedom is here in France--while it lasts. The right has indeed won. It's only a matter of time."
1,More trash from a Bush hater,"The recent review about ""Wag the Turkey"" was based on the lie that Bush ate Thanksgiving dinner in Iraq during breakfast, not dinner time. This was a lie, not very investigative. ANy book recommended by the wacko former Congresswomen McKinney needs to be avoided."
4,A Low-Budget Impressions,"The music of the Van Dykes, here from a 1966 album with some extra cuts, sound very much like a low-budget version of Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions (with the lead singer's falsetto and the somewhat crude studio acoustics). But a poor man's Impressions sounds a lot better than a lot of high-budget things that are recorded today, and the lowgrade recording somewhat adds to the charm of this collection (brings to mind a group of guys harmonizing in the bathroom of an inner-city high school). So while it may not be an essential purchase, it has it's own quirky appeal and is certainly worth a listen or two."
1,Waste of talent.,"This tape is only 25 minutes long and cost 20 bucks. I think Baron is a talented teacher but should find someone else to direct and produce his videos. I,ve never seen a bigger production mess."
5,Good oil,"Bought it for my Rx-8 which requires 5w20 according to factory rec...It's just oil, cant complain.. shipping was fast, bottles were new."
5,excellent,"I thought this was a really great book, but will there be more of Sierra? I really liked this book and i hope Mrs. Gunn will do a college series also!"
4,Easy Reading for Case Study Research,I found the book to be easy to read and understand reference case study research. Examples of methodology and research techniques provide a template with which one's on study can be designed and implemented.
2,For the fellow students in KOREA,"I am a high school teacher of physics in KOREA and also working on science research as a graduate student.We choose this book as a text book in the class named advanced research of physics class at graduate course for the education.This book doesn¡t have complete and detailed guide into conducting case study research and not so many example as well. But the contents are delivered in synchronized order and style. And it's goal and reasons for why we doing case study research are clearly mentioned and referred, and more over it includes workshop activities at the end of each chapter.In that respect this book is right on target for academic researchers using a case study approach."
3,Wow......... oh oh,"Pilotwings was one of the first releases for the Super NES, so you can't expect much from the 3-Dish graphics.But this game is so much fun!!!! It takes alot of skill to land vehicles, and I think the hardest level(s) is the skydiving one.Occaisionally you'll mess up, and it's entertaining!!! If you do not open your parachute on cue in the skydiving levels, you crash through the ground. Or if you don't set the guy with the jetpack down slowly an explosion occurs. Land on the white bumps and you go ""boing""I agree, the music is so funny to listen to, especially on the jetpack level, where you here the ""famous"" horrible singer.It took me forever to make it to the first helicopter level, because on the 4th series of levels.... well it's almost impossible to beat.Landing the airplane is also hard, mess one thing up you end up crashing.I'm going to keep this game because it's sooooooooooooooooo funny!!"
4,BRAVO! 8.5 OUT OF 10,"Pilotwings is still the best flight simulator you can find. The challenges are very engaging, you'll fly numerous aircraft through these obstacles, you'll get pilot licenses as you go through different instructors, and you'll have a ton of fun while doing it. This game never really gets old to play, and this is one of those kids games that I have not grown out of."
2,Frustrating,"This old game has good graphics, but the game is very frustrating. You need to fly through all the rings, extend the landing gear exactly on time, slow down on time, and try to make it on the runway. I always crash when I land on the runway very slowly and gently. Not to mention, you have to make a very high score which makes it very hard and it gives you a very little amount of points.I don't suggest you to get this game."
3,What are you expect?,"I mean really... ""what were/will/are you expect from this group??? It's a PussyCAT dolls!!! I think they(she) did a good job. She can sing and dance that's for sure. Plus she's also attractive. Anyway, I agree that about the rest of the cats. They should at least do some harmony and dance better. Right now they can't sing and can't dance and they didn't look better than the lead singer!?!?!?!? I have no idea why/how they got into this band."
2,All Gone Fishin,"Although there are a very good group of vocalist for this album, the only song I really loved was ""Sleepwalkin"" by Tanya Tucker. Absolutely fantastic song. In hind sight I should have just downloaded this one song instead of buying the entire album. However, the proceeds go to charity, so in that respect, it was worth the price of the cd."
1,Buyer Beware,Over the years I have bought Linksys products and have recommended their products to co-workers. Based on my experience with this product I will think twice before I do that again.I have the v4 edition of this router - I would think after 4 revisions they would start to get it right. The DHCP server on the hardware was very flaky and would stop giving IP addresses. The broadband router portion of the router would stop serving up web pages. I resorted to resetting the thing to get it to work again - this didn't always work either....
2,It's lucky I haven't smashed it yet,"All I can say after setting this router up (and rebooting it way too frequently, resetting it to defaults, upgrading the firmware, walking away and hoping it fixes itself, etc...) is don't buy it. When it works, it's fine. But it doesn't work without freezing for a couple minutes out of every 10, and after freezing a few times, it just locks up permanently (leading to the above-mentioned attempts at remedy). Oh, and when I say it freezes, I mean everything freezes. I have it connected to a cable modem on the internet side and a wired desktop and a wireless notebook on the local side. When it freezes, I have no internet, period. Wired or wireless. Zilch. So spend your money elsewhere--on something more reliable and stable."
2,Light volume only!,"This router should be used for low volume traffic only. I bought two of these, one for my home office and one for a client's office. The setup was easy and router, dhcp, firewall, wireless and ethernet were all fine on the weekend. Monday morning was a disaster! The traffic from 10 clients overwhelmed the device and dhcp was failing and throughput was in the [...]. I thought the device was faulty and swapped it for the one at home that was working fine for two client PCs. Same results. Now we use the office befw11s4 as a wireless access point only.Also, I've experienced certain ports being blocked that shouldn't have been according to the settings."
2,"Simple to set up, difficult to keep up.","My experience with all of Linksys' products prior to this device seem to be extremely simple to set up, and always seem to be very stable. That said, this product keeps up the fine tradition of being easy to set up, but loses its claim to fame on the stability issue. My device has locked up about every 6 hours since I plugged it in and gave it an Internet connection. I've read around that this is an issue related to NAT at high speeds. If this is the case, it doesn't make a very good broadband router, but if you're just using it for wireless access to your existing network, you might get along just fine with this."
2,Linksys: a testiment to mediocrity,"Linksys is consistent - when something works, it works great. The rest of the time, you're on your own. ...This system worked well initially, then spontaneously stoppped. After many frustrating attempts at customer support, I was finally able to reboot and get it working again. A simple hardware reboot isn't adequate - it needs to be physically disconnected from the power source for several minutes. We get to do this several times each week. I'm still waiting for an explanation from Linksys. Additionally, I'm convinced that the reset button is there for appearance only - it has yet to do anything for my system!"
2,Just pray that you don't need to call tech support,"Although Linksys has 24/7 tech support, you have to hold for about 24 hrs before speaking to someone. If you have limited experience with networking, set-up can turn into a nightmare. Also, the system requires significant tinkering if you want it to work within a VPN. It's great once it works but don't expect any help along the way."
4,"Good ""all in one"" but make sure this is your need.","This product works great. Setup was straight forward. My favorite feature is ""MAC Address Cloning"" which saved us a long wait and hassle getting our Cable Internet company to enter a new Mac Address. The computer with the ethernet card that has the original copy of the cloned address works on the LAN the box is routing. We did not need to bother or internet provider at all. That's worth a lot of dough!The combination of NAT Router and Hub may not be for everyone. If you don't think the ideal place for the Hub is the Ideal place for the Wireless access point, then I would consider purchasing these two as separate devices. We had no problems in a townhouse Condo, we have wireless throughout."
1,Very frustating,"I ended up returning this product. It never worked for long. A call to Linksys got it working, and it died after 20 minutes of surfing. The next day, I got it running again, and it died again after a slightly longer period. I gave up and went back to the wire. I hesitate to give a bad rating, because with ""new"" technology, it's hard to tell if there's something wrong with the product, or my computer, or my modem (linksys also), or my internet provider. However, I took all the steps, called my cable ISP, called linksys, searched the knowledge database, and it still wouldn't work. I can't wait until they work out the bugs and I can go wireless."
4,"Easy Installation, mediocre reception","I have just finished installing the wireless router and wireless pcmia network card. The directions were good, and it was set up in about 15 minutes. The notebook install went OK to. The reception for me was poor upstairs. One floor away, approximately 30-40 ft? I do like this product, and am enjoying sharing my broadband connection on my laptop."
4,Works well but still a bit complex to set up,"I got it working well, but it is still a bit too technical to set up. Took me a couple hours at least - more than it should."
1,The Wrong Way to Go,I would never buy another Linksys product again in my life. They have the worst costmer service and the 2 people i talked to had no idea what they where doing so they just hung up on me. Linksys is a company that will some day fail because of its bad service
1,Awfully unstable product.,"It works.. but sometimes it doesn't. And then, after working for a few minutes, it suddenly doesn't work. Then it *may* start to work, but eventually it will stop working anyway... (I hope you got the point)"
2,An unfortunate product,"Clearly, there is something flaky with the hardware in this thing if so many of us have to reset it all the time. I upgraded the firmware to the latest and it made no difference. If you buy one, it seems to be a crapshoot whether it will work or not."
4,Everyone else is crazy! This router rocks!,"I've used this product for over a year now and it's been the most reliable router I've ever owned. I suspect that most everyone who's having a problem with it has hooked it up themselves, with no prior experience doing so, and has not configured it properly. Take the time to contact Linksys to set it up correctly, and you'll have a worry-free wireless network for years to come (see caveat below).The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it is not compatible with my new laptop, which is running Vista Home Premium. If you're running XP, do not hesitate to get this router."
2,stopped working little after a year,Most of Linksys' competitors have warranties from 3-5 years whereas Linksys only offers 1-year warranty. My router simply decided to stop sending wireless signals a little over a year after I bought it. Very disappointed.
2,overpriced,"I've purchased three of these routers. Only one of which is still operational at a clients location. I find the BEFW11S4 to be very strong on signal but, unfortunately, weak on features. Tech. support is also given a low mark. One star on logging. One star on filtering. 4 stars on signal. There are much better routers out there for a lower price. Read alt.internet.wireless before you buy."
4,Awesome product if you can do more than just hit install,"You may read reviews about the LinkSys that say it is impossible to install and it's defective. Well, it's possible to install and it certainly isn't defective.To install the thing, you need to have a little more knowledge than the basic put the CD into the drive and hit install. It takes a little more know-how, like configuring your IP address and such. If you can be patient, the reward is fantastic. Even when the signal strength is only at 50%, you don't lose a second of download time.I do recommend though that the laptop or other desktop you'll be using runs 600 MHz or faster."
1,works on the odd days... not even,"This is the most fickel piece for computer equiptement on the market. We have 3 computers in our home and this system is connected to all. It only works when it wants too! If the weather is blowing the right way and on the odd days of the week. If your one of these people that likes to fix and fidget with things, this is for you! For the rest of you, wait until the tecnology advances some and improved systems are available. We spent alot and keep spending more... the computer store guy practically lives at our house...fixing and running this system. PS it R E A L L Y doesn't like to work if you have stucco walls.. it has a hard time getting reception no matter how well you put it by windows and interior walls."
2,Terrible tech support,"Having used Linksys products with success for several years, I have been dissappointed with their tech service recently. Expect long waits and technicians that don't know that they are doing and just want to get you off the phone. E-mail support is not any better. I suspect that the drop off in the quality of their support may be the result of their acquisition by Cisco."
5,Plug & Play,I was skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews but 3 people I work with had no problem installing their BEFW11S4.I took a chance and am I glad I did! Plug and play it took me maybe 10 minutes from the time I took it out of the box to being up and running. No interference problems. Works great with laptop anywhere in the house accessing wirelessly.
4,"A good start, but needs improvement","Most of the features worked just fine, and did exactly what you'dwant. There was a single exception, which was in port forwarding.I wanted to put a mail and web server behind the router so thatthe Linksys would be a firewall for other ports, but could notget the forwarding to work. This feature was described in themanual as ""unsupported"" meaning, I suppose, that Linksys knew itwasn't 100%.I understand there's now a BEFSR41 v2, and I'm hoping that thenew version is better."
2,Don't expect your rebate,"If you are looking to purchase this router, weigh this router's merits based on the full list price. After carefully saving my receipt, clipping out bar codes, and filling out forms I still had to wait 10 weeks to be told that my purchase was made outside of the qualifying period.Overall, the router is fairly easy to set up. Encryption was slightly less straight forward, but still logical if you keep notes as you go.The router signal strength is adequate but not impressive. I had to try two wireless cards in my PC before getting a signal (but this may have been the fault of my first wireless card). I have range of about 120 feet with my laptop."
4,does the job,"The linksys router does everything promised. Very easy to install, I was getting around 350mps internet download. Only draw back is the router is kind of bulky unlike the netgear, but oh well."
4,Good value for the price,"For the price, this is a good deal. I had to call tech support because the router could not handle DHTP with my laptop, but they fixed the problem pronto. My other machine configured and worked fine right away.I thought the signal would be much better than it is. The average throughput is generally 1 to 2 megabits/sec versus the 11 megabit/sec theoretical. I do find that the signal is lost on occassion."
2,Problems with insalation and poor reception.,"Maybe I got a lemon.. I dont know. But I had to wait about an hour for technical support the first time I called then about 25 minutes the second time. All I needed was to upload new Firmware and erase the flash memory. That finally being done...it Worked!!! Yaa!! Utt OHH!! However, I took my labtop with the Linksys PC card installed the went to my room... not more then 30 feet away and I have a ""poor quality link"" Thats not far.. On the side of the box it says 11mps @ 100 ft. I'm getting 2mps at 30 feet according to my configuration utility and a yard stick. Hmmm Maybe my walls are made out of led or something..."
1,Still Disappointed,"Normally I don't write reviews, but I'm so mad about this lockup issue and I don't want anyone else to go through it. Other posts here are right, this modem locks up at least 3 times per day for me. I have to run down to the basement unplug and plug back in. Absolutely frustrating and makes me wish I hadn't lost my old router by a power surge. What's more frustrating is there is nothing on the linksys support site and the firmware has not been updated since December of 02. Seven months and I'm the first one with this problem? I don't think so Linksys and I will be replacing you shortly."
1,"Fair product, horrible support after it died","The router was simple to install. It worked well for 3 months and then died. It took 2 days to get tech support to tell me it was dead, then an additional 5 days to get an RMA number. They then make you pay shipping back to them so they can replace it. They claim to return ship it in 3 days but it is now over 4 WEEKS and I still do not have it back even after 5 phone calls."
2,Trouble,"Try to get a hold of these guys and get some help. The friendly voice may say average wait time is 6 minutes, but I wound up on hold for 30+ minutes both times I called. Had trouble setting up both wireless and straight ethernet and tech support wasn't much help. It is in the box on the way back to Linksys."
1,This unit works great....if you live in a house w/no walls,"I was reading other responses of unsatisfied customers. I am glad I am not the only one who has problems with reception. I am currently logged onto the internet via my wireless router ...and I am getting 100% link, but 86% signal strength. Did I mention that I am a few inches away from the router! This unit works well if you have all your computers in 1 room...but if you have a house, FORGET IT! When I leave the room with my laptop I immediately get poor signal strength. I am fortunate that Fry's Electronics has a refund policy. I will return it this week."
1,A load of rubbish,Wish I had read these reviews. Couldn't get it to work at all and the customer support (sic) was useless! Taking it back tomorrow
1,DON'T BUY A LINKSYS ROUTER IF YOU HAVE A MAC COMPUTER,"I bought this router and spent almost two hours online with Linksys. After trying every sort of suggestion and speaking with three different tech support people who barely spoke English I finally understood that Linksys has ""limited support for Macs."" When I asked what ""limited support"" means, I was told ""we are not trained to help people with a Mac. If you can borrow a windows PC we can help you"". What a waste of time. I am sending the router back. Beware if you have a Mac."
1,Not worth owning!!,"I purchased this router in April 2006 along with a brand new computer. The installation process was very easy. From the first day I owned the computer, it would crash for no known reason. The error report indicated that a driver from recently installed software was causing the problem. After two months of lost connections, not being able to connect at all, and slow connections, I threw the router away. I purchased another Linksys router which was more expensive. Since I have installed the new router, my computer has not crashed, my internet connection is extremely fast and I have never lost a connection. Don't waste your money on this router; it will only cause frustration. Spend the extra money on a more reliable unit."
3,Let Me Put this easy for you all that are gonna by this....,Let Me Put this easy for you all that are gonna by this. If you are just geting it for a laptop or PSP or even a DS then go for it BUT if you plan on useing it for your desktop you are saddly mistaken. It constintly crashes on a desktop and refuses half the time to play videos or some times even download stuff I simply unplug the thing when not on my laptop or handheld.
5,LINKSYS 4 PORT WIRELESS ROUTER,"This unit installs and works just as claimed. I've installed at least 3 of them and each one is easier than before. As long as you have familiarity with the setting to make on the network adapters, either wired or wireless, this unit is superb. I like to use it with the WUSB11 wireless adapter for either notebook or desktop. All you need is a functioning USB port. Throughput is as claimed--11Mbps. 5 stars and good price."
3,ok for me,"This router works well as a router. As a wireless access point, connection fails when the USB adapter is in a room, and the router is in another room perhaps 60 feet away with a right angle turn.Also the USB adaptor does not work with windows XP, as suggested by their tech support. But I was able to get it to work, except that the utility window does not come up. They say the driver for XP will be available in a few days on their web site. I doubt it."
2,be prepared...,"novell ipx users? skip this. they dont pass ipx...in my office of like 50' away from the linksys pcmcia card? good reception. outside the walls? [not good]. granted i have about a foot of stucco walls. another test. i covered the antenna part of the card in the laptop. still about 20' away from the base unit. the signal drop by almost to 50-60%.so i stuck the unit by a window on the second floor. then i walked outside. 1500'??? not even close...so when you get this, open it and use it immediately. i waited to receive the pcmcia unit from another place and my 30 days return policy ran out.if you keep it, upgrade the firmware of the unit immediately. on mine, the WEP did not work at all with its own card for the laptop until i made the change... kinda sad...again, novell users, unless you upgrade to pure IP... stay away from this..."
4,"Runs great, if you read the manual","After I thought I got a dud, I had to re-read the manuals and discovered why the connections did not work. After that, it was smooth sailing! Every laptop in my house got a connection, all three floors came through with no interference, and my wired PCs saw the other laptops. I am impressed. I bought all Linksys parts for this wireless endevour, the four port switch wireless and the PC card they offered. so now as I am writing to you on one of the laptops, I would recommend this product and the wireless adapters if you do not have the time to drill or break walls down.I have only four stars here, but that is because of the manuals I had to read in order to get the right answer. All in all a great product."
1,This product is not ready for prime time,"I totally agree with hydrogen3. When I first got it, I had a lot of problems and linksys tech support said it was a bad router. Then I got a replaced one and STILL the same problem.Linksys kept pointing at Win2k TCP/IP stack which generate the lock up on the router and they weren't helpful at all. SOme of them don't even know how the products work.I am actually getting the WAP11 and the DSL router with 4 port switch unit separately.Not a happy person at all after 3 weeks of frustration."
3,documentation and web site lacks mac support,"after updating the firmware using a pc, this wireless router works perfectly with mac os x and the airport (802.11b) card inside the apple powerbook g4 titanium. it is disappointing that the macintosh platform is not discussed in the documentation or on the linksys product support web site. it wouldn't hurt to mention that when entering the 26 digit number for a 128-bit WEP key on the mac, you must precede it with the '$' symbol. it is particularly disappointing that there is no way to update the firmware without using microsoft windows."
5,Works great and was easy to set up,"I had previously tried to get the DLink DI-713P to work and I was unsuccessful. I called D-Link and they said that the item was defective and I would have to mail it back for a replacement. I said ""forget this"" and returned the item and bought the Linksys wireless router. I use it in my 2 bedroom apartment. The bedrooms are about 50 feet apart and the transmission is great. My roommate is able to download music and games so much faster now and without any annoying wires. The Linksys support techs were helpfuil also. I called them when I had a question and they were able to answer it easily. I hope this review helps. I really like the product and I will promote Linksys to anyone."
1,Forget the Wireless,"I have had Linksys Tech Support on the line telling me the the 3 Com cards I had were the reason I could not access the internet with the wireless. The hard wired computer worked fine. Not sure why a 3 Com would not be talking to a Linksys. Both support 802.11b, I thought. So after hours on the line, I go buy the WPC11 and guess what...you guessed it.. it doesn't work either! Another hour on the phone with tech support with no new results. They let me know I could send an email to Linksys Level 2 and expect 2 days before an email response. This product and company is [junk]. I will be sending it all back.."
5,GREAT and EASY,"This is for sure the ""ALL in ONE"" type of Product with an important factor - IT IS REALLY EASY TO USE and CONFIGURE.I have also done a Firmware upgrade for new features and it was really easy too.I really suggest you to buy it.In addition the product AC Power can work also in Europe as it can work 110-240, 50-60Hz."
5,Surprisingly easy to set up and use,"This router is great.I have 2 PCs connecting to cable modems for Internet connectivity, and with the addition of this router, I only need one, and the laptop is truly mobile! The set up was so surprisingly easy I nearly thought I had made a mistake, because it just couldn't be this easy, but it is!!! Follow the instructions on the CD inclosed with the Router, before doing anything, and the set up goes through without a hitch!!"
5,"Easy to setup, works great",I'm not a network techie by any means. I was able to hook this up along with my 5 computers and be up and running in no time. This thing works great and I wish I had gotten it sooner. Life is good!
1,So much for advertised specs,"I was very disappointed with this product. Put the router on the first machine and installed a wireless card on a PC in the basement. Everything was installed properly and there was no signal. Called technical support and was told that the signal could not go through the floor and a few walls.I put the wireless card in a laptop and was able to get full 11Mbps transmission while in the same room as the router. As soon as I left the room, the signal degraded. Little or no reception less than 50 ft from router, and definately no signal in the basement, less than 100 ft away.I truly do not recommend this product. Simply does not work as advertised. Great if you live in a small studio or one bedroom apartment, but in that case do you really need a wireless product."
2,The Worst Tech Support Staff Ever,"You may want Linksys products, you may have the know-how to install them, and so good on you. But if you're just a regular ole home user like me, then God help you because their tech support won't. Average 30 minute hold time, only to talk to a snide, condescending support person who petulantly fired questions at me and then would let loose a stream of gobbledygook, misdiagnosing the problem and basically trying to get rid of me so they could go on their break. After three tries, I gave up. I wonder if Linksys management knows how bad their support staff is."
2,Wish it lasted more than a week!,"Router was a snap to setup and relatively easy to configure wireless with the NetGear 802.11b pcmcia card. Unfortunately, the router slowly died after about a week's worth of use. I've order a replacment, hopefully this one will not have the same problems. The defective unit I recieved ended up wasting a lot of my time and would have been near impossible to troubleshoot if I didn't have my old LAN only router there to verify my network and wan connection was still ok."
2,Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router,"definitely need improving. Here what I see after 5 days:first time set up was so easy. It reconigned my cable modem and ran right away. The problem started when I turned off the pc. One the pc (Win XP) turned back on, it could not get the DHCP address from the router so of course no Internet connection. Had to repower off router, modem and pc in this order for it to work. Try it several time and got the same symtom. Upgraded firmware still not resolve the problem. Still can not get tech support because i was on hold for too long."
1,Very disappointed,I have had two different BEFW11S4s and both devices crashed within 6 minutes (diagnostic light would go on and stay on). All tech support could tell me was that the motherboard was bad and they would send me a new one. I have had very bad luck with Linksys access points. I run a very plain three computer network. Linksys could not explain why their devices would not work. I would recommend a different name brand.
4,Works Well,"For a relatively straightforward wireless network, this device works well and is a good value. Set-up was fairly simple and I had no trouble getting the device to sync up with my DSL modem. Range was about as expected although, depending on where you locate the access point, it's not going to be as far as indicated on the product packaging. I hooked up a Linksys signal booster with this access point, and now have good coverage throughout the house and even outside on my laptop. For my purposes, 802.11b works fine and the technology is at a price point where it makes little sense to wait if a wireless network is something you've been thinking about trying out."
5,Works as advertised...,"So far very impressed. I had the router setup and working with in 20 minutes of opening the box. The documentation is clear, and to the point. I currently have a Dell PC, an Apple iBook, and an Xbox running through the LInksys, and set up was as simple as plug and play for all three. For anyone looking for a router for Xbox live, you can't go wrong here. If you're looking for an alternative for the shockingly overpriced Apple Airport base station, again can't go wrong. Although not officially ""supported"" I had no problem configuring the router via OS X and Apple's Safari browser. If you're running OS X 10.2 or later, configuring the 128bit WEP encryption is also now much easier. Apple has a very useful technote posted on their site if you do run into problems."
2,Dead after a year,"Never had much of a problem with my router. Once I had to update the firmware, but that was it. Yesterday, I noticed that the WLAN link light was off and my wireless connections were no longer working. Called Linksys support and told them all of my troubleshooting procedures. They had me reset the router again and it still didn't function. Then they asked me how long I had the router. I said that I had purchased it around 1/15/02. They told me, ""We're sorry but that's more than a year. We won't be able to help you."" Apparently, the wireless part of the router burns out (I can still use the switch ports to connect via cable). I paid around [$$$] for this last year. I would have expected it to last for more than a year - or at least have been given some assistance in fixing it. Beware - you may have to replace this annually."
3,Linksys Access Point - not quite the strength you may need,"I purchased the BEFW11S4 access point from Linksys for my home network. While it did connect up eventually, I needed to follow the CD installation instructions rather than the quick start instructions to get it communicating. My biggest problem with the unit is the low signal strenght available from the unit. We have a space that is only 60x40x30 feet requiring coverage inside the house, and there are often problems maintaining a connection through two walls and 40 feet of distance. Outside connectivity, through only one wall, only extends to about 60 feet. This is a far cry from the specification stating >50 meters. I do not get 2MB at 50 meters, must less the advertised 11Mb at that distance. I will be buying another access point to extend my operating range."
2,"Software good, hardware bad!","We bought this product recently for use in a house where 5 students are sharing an external radiolink. We have had serious problems using it as stated.300 feet indoor? We put the station in the attic and pointed the antennas down. We live in an old wooden house. Still the signal was only at 60% in the living room. That is 2 floors down, and not even 25 feet. In the basement, further 8 feet down, it jumped up to 6% one in a while.The system proved completely useless for all practical purposes.The software systems for controlling the unit are veery good, intuitive and helpfull. ...Btw: We checked wether the external radiolink could interfer with the signals. It didn't."
1,"I guess its life is one year, while during the year, it still does not work ver ywell","I shouldn't complain. I got this item for free due to a really special discount. I got it one year ago, and it has some very weird setup that stops me from watching movies online. It is fine; I don't need to watch it every day. Exactly one year later, it starts to break down. Now I need to restart the router every 30 minutes.This product comes with a customer service e-mail. However,when I tried to contact them ,all I received are two auto-reply e-mail and customer service questionaire. In their auto-replies, they keep telling me a tech person will contact me shortly, which is 1 month ago.The deal may be nice, but don't waste time I that. That's my advise."
3,DO NOT FLASH THE FIRMWARE ON THIS ROUTER,"This router was working great with really good range for over a year until the day I flashed with 1.5 firmware (it had firmware at least a year old right out of box). Now the router needs to be reset every ten to forty hours because of wireless link DHCP loss.I had installed the newer Linksys WirelessG routers several times since installing this unit, and saw these similar issues and can only conclude that the latest firmware programmers at Linksys really suck.Avoid these routers until these issues have been fixed."
1,Version 4 is terrible,The version 4 of this router is nightmarish.The router works for a couple of hours and then needs to be reset.Very often it loses its routing tables.I have an older version 2 also and it works fine.It would be best to keep away from the latest version.
4,No Problems Here,"Highly recommended. I'm using this router with my cable modem and a Linksys wireless PC card on my laptop. Installation of the router was simple and I had no problems. Installation of the PC card was simple, however the instructions were pretty much useless. When the router signal is strong, I notice no difference in speed over regular network wire. The signal is strong and fast between interior walls and upper/lower floors of the house. However, the signal drops off significantly when I go outside."
5,Amazing Product,"I bought this wireless router after having a normal Linksys router for several years because the person renting my detached garage apartment wanted to get internet access, but didn't want to install new phone jacks. I was worried that the signal wouldn't reach through 2 exterior walls and about 60 feet, but I installed the card and was immediately able to receive a signal from the apartment. The setup was very easy and now I can take the computer anywhere in the house (or outside) and still be on the net. And the tech support people are very helpful."
5,Easy wireless that works great :>),I read a lot of reviews about linksys and all the other brands. After a while you think none of them will work based on some of these reviews... I finally worked up the courage to buy a Linksys BEFW11S4 broadband router and matching card for my used dell laptop. Out of the box working in about 10 minutes would have been faster but I was very cautious I expected to have problems. But it was problem free. I still have some configuring to do like setting up the e-mail acct and printer sharing. But I am surfing the net in every room in the house with this router right now. I am writing this on my laptop in a spare bedroom. I walked out into my garage listening to a net radio station from LA. I have been in all the rooms of my house and the signal is strong and the net speed is fast. I think this is going to be a great router its worked great all night. I would like to go outside to test more range but its raining really hard.
1,Avoid this like the plague,"Bought this together with PC card so notebook could be used around the apartment whilst PC connected directly to router. Never had so many problems with staying connected to internet (cable) ever and this was just my PC, the connection with the wireless notebook (when there was one) was painfully slow. Thought it was a problem with my cable provider but as soon as I disconnected and reverted to old set-up connection has been fine.AVOID THIS ONE LIKE THE PLAGUE...feel cheated that ""1 star"" is the lowest grade on this review page, it deserves a ""-5 star"" for ""it couldn't get any worse"".There should be a law against selling stuff this bad. What a complete waste of time and money."
4,Worth the money,"I took this one for granted until I bought the Netgear MR814v2 for my office. I've used the Linksys at home for about 10 months now, no problems!!I have 4 systems which use this router. I telecommute from home very often and love having the flexibility of being wireless. Also, the Linksys router provides incredibly reliable connections when I compare it with the Netgear which seems to drop connections every 5 mins (after going through every possible configuration and an inept tech support).Recommended!"
1,BEFW11S4 Drops DHCP connections,As others noted below this router drops local connections constantly (2 to 3 times daily) I did not have this problem until I updated the firmware to the latest release: 1.52.02If you have this router do not update the firmware...If you do not have this router don't buy it...I called linksys techsupport and they pretend to not know of the problem that a simple google search reveals.
1,Lost connection in 30 minutes,"If you surf internet lightly, this router may be good for you! However, you will run into connection lost problem if you have heavy internet traffic.My DSL connection is 3M/512K. After configuring this router and upgrade to latest /greatest firmware, I fire up eMule and BitTorrent client -----> This router choked within 30 minutes. I thought it's my configuration, No, it's the router. Check dslreports.com, lots of people complain connection stall problem with this router. Or you can just do google ""BEFW11S4 issues v4"", and you will believe me!Conclusion: Stay away from this router!"
1,Wireless=no connection,"Worst purchase i ever made. I had used wireless before with Webgear but thought a wireless router would be a good upgrade. Setup was extremely easy, but connection speed from 5 feet was so bad my connection kept timing out. I was running Windows ME and was not aware of any upgrade patch, but for the money I said screw it and returned it for store credit. I'm running wire this weekend. Stay away unless you get a cash back guarantee."
2,Linksys befw11s4,"I order this but I have some problem with this, I have to reboot it every day, it is not steady and it was not the range it says it will be"
2,Don' t buy used electronics,"The router only worked for 7 days! I ended up buying a new one. If it does not have everything in the box from original purchase, rethink spending the money."
2,...Shoddy Product,"...It falls apart both physically and logically, and while the idea is wonderful, Linksys really screwed up trying to implement it. Linksys Tech Support is pitiful, and after them telling me over 15 times to upgrade to the newest firmware, which was buggy in the first place, I gave up and swore off linksys products forever.If you want something like this, forget it. Go get yourself a decent Cisco ADSL router, many more features, and a separate 802.11b wireless gateway, or one of the new -a devices.DONT BUY THIS, THE RED LIGHT WILL HAUNT YOU :("
4,"""Special Bus""","You must have ridden the ""special bus"" to school if you cannot get this working. My 3 year old daughter figured it out in 10 minutes! The folks who submitted negative reviews must be technically challenged, and should go back to trying to set the clocks on their VCR's."
4,Works Fine -- MAC Address Cloning Saved Me,"I'm using this router along with the Linksys WPC11 Wireless network card on two computers. This setup is purely for internet access. The software & hardware installation was simple and the signal strength appears adequate (install the utility software that comes with the wireless card).The big help came when I discovered my broadband provider (Roadrunner) used MAC Addresses. Roadrunner as a policy will not register additional MAC Addresses. Fortunately, this Router comes with MAC Address cloning. I entered the Cable Modem MAC Address onto the cloning configuration page, reset the router (a little button in the back and is a necessary step [I found this out the hard way]), powered everything down and back up and I was in business."
3,"works okay, but linux users beware","First, this product is a fabulous concept. It containseverything you need to set up a wireless network inone small box. Unfortunately, I encounteredseveral difficulties in actually getting it to work.In particular, it worked fine for a computer runningWindows 98, but not for a computer running Linux.Furthermore, I found the technical support to be rude andineffective.I finally ended up getting everything to work by installingthe latest firmware upgrade. Hopefully things willcontinue to work smoothly."
2,Not for sissies,"All those who gave this one star are just a bunch of sissies. I'm giving it two. Sure, I have to do a soft reset several times a day. And some days I cannot get both the wired and wireless connections to work at the same time. And still other days the thing hangs up so that I can't even receive a few emails without it getting stuck. And there is alot of powering on and off of PC's and routers. But this is the stuff that tough guys just deal with.Those tech support people told me that my unit was defective too - and that I could pay to send it to them and they would get another one to me in a few weeks or so. But unlike those other sissies, I kept my unit and live with the pain.In fact I'm sitting here now creating this review while connected with a wireless connection and I can tell you without hesitation that this unit"
3,"Come on, now.","For the love of God, please refrain from purchasing this. I've been using this as my wireless router for much too long, and I'm on Amazon now to find a replacement. I've had this router for many years, and it has been consistent in its unreliability. I'm constantly pulling the cord out of the back and plugging it back in (easier than hitting a reset button that's best accessed by a ballpoint pen). I'm hoping that technology has progressed to the point that I can count on a wireless router that continues putting out a signal for more than a day. In any case, I can't imagine that someone is seriously considering purchasing this now, but if you are, please do your best to scrape up a few extra pennies and buy something newer. If you must have this one, hit me up -- I'll be more than happy to sell you mine!"
1,This product is garbage,"Rarely a week goes by that this thing doesn't lock up for no apparent reason and have to be rebooted. I've called tech support and the best they could do was guide me through a firmware upgrade or two, which did not fix the problem. After my experiences with this hunk o'junk, I do not recommend purchasing anything with the name ""Linksys"" on it."
1,Half Decent product - Nightmare support,"Great product if it works. If you are as unfortunate as I was to get a defective router, be prepared for an experience out of Kafka. Try for hours to get to Linksys tech support. Become a teacher of English as a second language. After several times being told how to set up a router, regardless of what your issue might be, try to get an event number, so you don't have to start from scratch with the next tech -uh oh - no can do - the Citrix server is down. Eight months and I still can't get an RMA for a warranty exchange. If they can stall for another four months, the warranty will expire - they are batting .666 so far. Can you spell ""Netgear"" or ""Microsoft"" or ""Cisco""? I can."
4,Wireless Internet,This little unit works well in my small office space and generally throughout my home. Purchase was to provide a wireless connection for my laptop and this unit does just that and does it well.
2,Stay away,"This product has cost me far more time and trouble than it's low (available) cost would warrant. I got mine (...), and switched it in place of an older Netgear, to make a nice Linksys ""stack"" in my closet.With the latest hardware and firmware, mine locks up approximately every day, sometimes two or three times. The solution, remove power for ten seconds, is simple, but unaccptable with such frequency. Look at www.dslreports.com for (currently) 36 page discussion of problems and partial solutions, or just do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a low cost WIFI router/gateway."
4,Great with a Rebate,"Overall, I am very pleased with my recent Linksys Wireless-B purchase. It came with a $30 rebate, which covered more than half of the selling price. It was easy to install and works excellently in every room of my apartment. However, if you are not able to obtain a similar rebate, go for the Wireless-G router."
4,linksys wireless,Easy to set up. Older home with thick walls limits usable distance. No interference. No problems. Looks good. Good support from Linksys.
4,Failed But Amazon Has Compensated Me Well,"I purchased a BEFW11S4 from Amazon/LinkSys on November 18th and the wireless portion has never worked (I also purchased a wireless CF, and wirless PC card). I thought that I just couldn't figure out the proper configuration until I finally got a hold of LinkSys technical support this weekend and they walked me through numerous setting changes. In the end they told me that I need to get a new BEFW11S4...."
1,stay away from it,"If I knew what I know today I wouldn't touch this product with a 10' pole.Can't go 2 weeks with it, without it getting confused, and stop working, the only thing is working on it is red lights blinking. After a month I have to send it back to linksys, and deal with there restrictions on a product..."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"The Linksys product may be okay, but God help you if you need customer service! I bought the BEFW11S4 (their wireless router), and couldn't get it to install with my DSL modem. Four evenings I spent on the phone, in their service queue: a total of 6 hours, and NEVER did anyone answer the phone. Their call center system told me that the average wait time was 10 minutes, and after an hour and a half I had to hang up (there are others in the house who need to use the phone).I took the system back and bought one from Siemens. I did have a problem installing that one as well, but got through to a service rep in 6 minutes. Works great!Night and day. If I were you, I'd avoid this company if I could. I'll never buy another product from them."
2,"If you use VPN, don't bother with this router!","This router isn't bad if you don't use the wireless option or plan on using VPN. But if the wireless option is poor, save yourself some bucks and get the much cheaper non-wireless version.Basically, my beefs are as follows: 1. Wireless... very poor reception... unless you are working within 15-20 feet of the router. 2. Use with VPN... constantly loses your connection... doesn't help with productivity at all."
3,Decent product but a little flaky!,"I received the router and despite a degree in Systems Engineering, I couldn't get it to work instantly. After about 15 mins with tech support and plugging in IP addresses, etc...we got it to work. But now I had a bunch of IP static addresses set up in it...I wanted it to work totally dynamic since I bounce between a hotel, office, and DSL @ home. So when I deleted the IP's & gateway server settings, it didn't work and I couldn't get through to Tech support this time. I finally got it to work by changing all the settings and since then it typically works 50% of the time. The rest of the time, I have to reset the router and reset all the settings.Product still needs a little work."
4,Working great w/ 1 desktop and 2 laptops.,Installed with out any problems. Has been working great. VPN to corp from home works also. Their tech support depends on who you get. Good help from some. Bad answers from others. One person told me that I would have to work with my HQ to get VPN to work. Found enable pptp pass through on the set up page and it works great. Working email and internet form around the house and outside.
3,Good router unless you video conference,"I bought this router so that I could surf the net or access my network from anywhere in my house or front yard. When I got it home and set it up it appeared to work like a dream. All I really had to do is plug in my cable modem an go. The problem didn't show up until I tried to video conference with my mom. She could hear and see me, but I could not hear or see her. After going through the trouble shooter and trying all sorts of different security and port authorization changes I finally gave up and called Linksys. When I got ahold of someone and I explained the problem they told me that they probably would not be able to help because this router does not work well with video. After a couple more changes it was determined that video conferenceing was just not possible with this router. A huge disappointment for me and my mom. If it wasn't for the video this router would have received 5 stars."
3,Lost Router,"Loved the set up, got the wireless network up and running no problem in 20 minutes. Worked great for two weeks, then I could not connect to Bell South DSL, Had to power down the router and reset the settings. This happens about every two weeks. Talked to Linksys tech support and suggested new firmware, hopefuly this will fix the problem."
1,Poor Performance,"I was very disappointed with this product. Advertising said 300 feet, I was lucky if it did 30 feet. Even at 30 feet it would loose the connection and I would have to power every thing off to get it working again. A waste of money!!"
4,overall,"Well, installing this with Win 2000 was harder than I thought. I heard there was problems but figured if I downloaded the lastest driver it would work out. Wrong. The driver place a file in the wrong place and once moved it worked fine. If you buy this and are going to use it with the wireless pc card then you need to worry about this. If you are going to hardwire (why are you buying wireless) then you are ok. So I guess the problem is more with the wireless pc card then the hub."
1,Defective Product,"I bought this to replace a Linksys router/firewall/switch that I have used for about 9 months - a device which worked great. However, this unit has been unusable. I have spent several futile hours trying to get the wireless working with my Wife's Compaq Wireless card.I am a Network Engineer and have setup 802.11b wireless equipment before. This unit simply does not work as advertised. Of course, Linksys tech support blamed the problem on the Compaq card.It also locks up for no apparent reason. I will be returning it. What a shame. If it did what is was supposed to do, it would a great product."
1,Truth in Advertising???,"I have had nothing but problems with this device. I bought it for the wireless feature. One room away (less than twenty feet) and I can not get a good connection. Three techs from the company have told me that the conection quality in the manual is under optimal conditions. Things like wires in the walls, microwave ovens, lightbulbs, roam phones etc. can degrade the product. One tech suggested that ""line of sight"" is best. Another stated ""we have been getting many complaints about the range"". Two of these techs suggested that there are products that will enhance the distance, but will void the warrenty."
1,Crashes when trying to view streaming video,"This review applies to version 4 of the BEFW11S4 router. I do not know if older versions have the same issues or not. The latest firmware does not support streaming videos!!! Turns out, this is a very well known issue with this router in the on-line community. If you try to watch videos from web sites like cnn.com, roadandtrack, etc. the router will crash and have to be re-booted. The older firmware revisions did not have this problem. However, only the latest firmware revision correctly supports UPnP (a very usefull feature for file-sharing software). Linksys has not come out with a any new firmware version since middle of 2005 which really goes to show their commitment to customer support."
2,Finally gave up,"I had to finally give up on this router. I have tried updating the firmware, reverting to old firmware and everything in between. I was having to reboot the modem almost daily to maintain an internet connection. And, having gone to VOIP phone, my home phone system was only as good as the router, which was to say poor.I bought on sale a Netgear wbr-1310 802.11g and have had no problems whatsoever. It has run almost continually now for over a month and I have never been forced to reset it to regain a connection. Apparently Linksys is having firmware issues on several models (that's what the best buy guy said).I do like the linksys setup software and their setup menus for controlling the router, but the performance was just not up to snuff."
1,Worked for six months,"Easy setup, great at first. Then it started dropping connections and acting flaky. The problem was not my DSL provider (SBC), because a direct connection to my PC always works perfectly.Then, about three weeks after the warranty expired, it stopped transmitting any wireless signal.Thanks, LinkSys!"
1,This [router] has been an insane nightmare.....,"Although I never have a problem getting an internet connection when connecting my computers directly to my cable modem, this so called router still can't talk to my modem - and this is after a week of trying! Linksys tech support has so far had me perform all sorts of tests, and first told me the router has a bad WAN port and to exchange it.So I did (both Linksys and Amazon refused to overnight me a replacement). Yep, I replaced it, but still the SAME PROBLEM.Now they tell me that on this one the firmware needs updating, they'll email me something that'll allow me to do it.They never emailed it.I call them again about it, and they want me instead to BORROW SOMEONE'S HUB(!)to do some more tests. Yeah, that's not a hassle.If you take your chances with this [router], pray that you don't have this same nightmare."
5,it's a breeze to setup,This has to be the most amazing home networking product out there for it's reliability and ease of use in setting up.Plug it inturn off your cable of dsl modemturn it back onrestart your computerthat's it! if you want to do moreopen up a web browser to 192.168.1.1 (password: admin)and do your configurations for the wireless part there.It's amazing how consistent this product has been in the times I have set it up for clients and friends. It's a joy to use and highly recommended!
2,Good for vanilla; Painful to setup IPSEC,"This is a good solution for a plain vanilla Wireless based Internet access solution. I bought this solution for my home office. I use Cisco VPN (IPSEC based solution) client to access my corporate office. Setting Cisco VPN thru this product is a harrowing experience. It involved upgrading firmware, which can often fail. Further, getting hold of Linksys is not easy at all during business hours. On 2 occasions it took me 45 minutes to get thru.Like I said good solution for plain vanilla Internet access. But if you ned to support CISCO VPN then I highly recommend the Netgear MR814 802.11b Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router. This took me less than 15 mins to setup."
3,"Good product, but setup and range can sometimes be a problem","Although the Linksys Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router works well when it works, setup and configuration was somewhat of a hassle, and sometimes feels only shakily configured. Range goes to about 100 feet maximum, but this could be a limitation with the matching Linksys Wireless 802.11b cards, and not necessarily this Wireless Access Point itself."
2,works then doesn't work,"i just go this router yesterday and i am already having problems with it. it works for 2 minutes then locks up. I can't watch music videos or do anything like that because it locks up constantly. i would definitely not recommend this router to anyone. Anytime that i want the router to unlock i have to go to the setup screen, click on status and then release and renew the DHCP everytime. I do that about 20 times in a matter of 20 minutes.. thats ridiculous if you ask me. anyone know how to fix the problem let me know and i might change my mind about this thing. I couldn't even send in this review without having to release and renew. dang this sux."
1,Run away run far away,"I should have known things were bad when they sent me a broken router to begin with. I have nothing positive to say about the Linksys company and will never buy another Linksys product. When I got my brand new modem and router and plugged everything in, none of the house laptops received any signal. After calling Linksys about the problem they initally blamed me and it was only after days of fighting that they agreed for me to send my router to them where they would evaluate the problem. It was over two weeks before they returned my brand new router and when I got it back it was no longer a brand new router, it was a refurbished one. It worked well for just over a year. Then the warranty expired and the router began to experience severe failures. Tech support was called and after hours (no exaggeration) of arguing they would finally patch the problem and it would work again for a few months only to crash again and start the headache over."
1,Very Disappointed With This,"I just placed this unit in my network setup, simply because I have a Linksys cable modem and I wanted the units to be stackable with each other. It replaced a Netgear MR814v1, which worked flawlessly for over a year.After a frustrating weekend, I was not able to get my Linksys unit functioning at all for a consistent period. The wireless status kept flickering between available/not available. Checked the firmware version, it's up to date. Messed around with the all the settings, nothing worked. Ran a [ping -t] test for about 5 minutes to the gateway, 94% Loss!!!! And when it did get through the TTL was always over 150. On the Netgear MR814v2 TTL was a consistent 64.I've had many other Linksys products and have never had any trouble with them, I'm hoping that this is just an anomaly.But anyways, I went to store and purchased the Netgear MR814v2. After 10 hours of use, not one unavailable message popped up. Unfortunately, this is a Linksys product I cannot recommend."
4,Works as supposed to but had problems setting up,"I decided to replace my Linksys 4-Port Cable/DSL Router with this model so I could get wireless to my xbox downstairs. I had a difficult time setting up the new router, it seemed to not give me the ip address provided by my cable modem. After 2 hours and a firmware update, I gave into calling support. After 10 mins on hold, I got a rep that helped get me online. We changed the ip address on the router and then uplugged everything to reset. That seemed to do it, he said the problem was with it being the same setting as the older router, i think.Overall I like the product alot now that it works. I get good reception downstairs, at least it seems like it. The support rep was helpful and able to help me get online."
3,great when its up,"We have this router and 2 of the wireless usb connections too in my home. One is 2 levels below the router in the basement and has no problem. Unfort our network goes down for no understood reason about once every week or two and must be reset before everything goes back online. No idea why. Otherwise, this works very well."
3,Works fine if you get past the installation process,"I bought this router together with the Linksys WUSB11 USB wireless adapter. The software and driver installation for both units went flawlessly but I had trouble connecting to the internet. It seemed that the adapter was having trouble talking to the router. I called Linksys tech support and talked to a tech service rep from Manila, Philippines. Fortunately, he was very knowledgeable and was able to walk me through 30 minutes of resetting the network settings on my PC and get them to work. It is working great now and I have good, fast internet speed. This product is definitely not user-friendly. Do not expect them to work right out of the box unless you are an IT expert and know how to fiddle around with the network settings on your computer. I loathed having to go through the set up process again for any future PCs. Beyond that, it works fine once you passed the installation huddle."
1,Not what I expected.,"I have used Linksys products for networking home computers for some time now and with a few exceptions have been very pleased.The Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router did not perform like the Linksys product descriptions claimed it would.I attempted to share a cable modem in a home network, but I could not get a connection from this device across a moderate sized house with interior walls constructed out of drywall. The the transmitter and reciever were separated by about 50 feet on opposite sides of this home and I could not get a connection on any of the 6 channels.I went as far as turning off the one wireless phone, even though it was not operating in the 2.4 gig frequency. The home owner did not know of any other wireless devices in his home.The adjacent homes were over 30 feet from the sides of this home and it has water to the rear."
5,"Great value, but a little extra knowledge goes a long way","I love the capabilities of this unit, and thought that it was relatively easy to set up. However, I have a 10-year background in data networking, so I was able to get the unit set up with far more ease than most would. New users less experienced with data networking should read the instructions and have access to Google groups (to search for answers to any problems they have) as they set up the unit.It is at its best if you have some desktops that are already wired together and you are adding some laptops to the mix. It doesn't preform very well when using WEP enbcryption, although it is fine.My wife and I like the capabilities so much that we take it to my in-laws house when we visit so we can have net access through their cable modem."
2,limited range,"I bought this wireless router in early November and finally set it up in mid March! I have not yet used the Linksys wireless notebook card, but the Microsoft wireless notebook card I have is giving ""low"" and ""poor"" signal strength readings 40 to 50 feet away indoors. Big disappointment! I will try raising the router higher and later, if I have to, I'll get a Linksys signal booster, but I shouldn't be having these problems at such short ranges. The set up was a snap since it replaced a Linksys 10/100 eithernet router on the same network. 128 bit WEP, MAC filtering and SSID broadcast suppression for security was easy as pie and I have nothing but praise for the browser based setup that Linksys employs. All my other experiences with Linksys products has been excellent, and I have set up three home networks all with Linksys routers."
2,Not as Good as You Might Think,"The product works well unless your setup includes having the router get a DHCP address from your provider. It would seem that every time the DHCP address expires, the process of obtaining a new address fails. This results in you having to reset the router and since its wireless, there's a pretty good chance you're not in the same room as the router. Their tech support will only give you the next revision of the firmware if its available, which they sware will fix it but never does. I gave up on them. But its not an expensive router, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Centrino users watch out!,"Not up to speed with Centrino computers - requires endless tweaking to make a reliable wireless connection. Newest firmware upgrades are still unstable. Linksys tech support is excellent and always available - they just can't solve the problem, though!"
3,Capable product,"The product is very easy to set up. The ethernet ports seem to be a bit too small so removing cat 5 cables is difficult. I was dissapointed to learn that you cannot lock down the wireless network to a specific set of MACs. This seems like a very basic and useful feature. Overall, I would shop around and see if you can do better with NetGear for the money."
2,Ok router. There are better ones that are cheeper,This isn't a bad router but for the money you could do alot better. I know most home/small office routers are plastic but this one seems flimsy. It also lacks in features in the firmware. You can only forward 10 ports etc.. In my opinion Netgear and Dlink make a better router.
2,"Thought it was ok, but it's not","Well I did read all the negative stuff about this product before buying it... Didn't think to believe it.On the first day the router crashed once, rebooting it fixed it and it worked fine for a couple of months, and now the problems are setting in. It will just stop functioning about twice a day when you're transferring data through the router continuously (eg. long downloads) and need resetting to get back on the net. The access point also goes down when this happens (stays visible but no data can pass). This is getting frustrating.If you don't use the router function it seems to perform fine. Range is excellent. Mostly the router that disappoints. The limited (10) custom portmaps was very restrictive too.. Oh well. Hope for some firmware updates!"
1,Drops connections after an hour or so,"I have a version 3 that has worked fine for many months, and wanted to get another one for traveling. I bought a version 4, thinking ""newer is better"" but found that after being connected for about an hour, the thing would lock up. To get it to work for another hour, I had to unplug it and plug it in again. Then it would work for another hour or so. I took it back, and got another one, but had exactly the same problem. I took that one back also, and lo and behold, there was one of the earlier models on the shelf (actually version 3.2), so I bought that one. It has worked flawlessly for the last year or so.I would recommend staying away from version 4, unless they have resolved this problem 100%."
5,SWEET IS THE LIFE,Well what can i say it works great.The only problem i had was setting up my wireless laptop. The laptop not the router. I couldn't have the wireless bridged like it was when i bought the laptop the sec i unbridged it it worked.THIS IS GREAT
1,Do Not Buy This Router,Like others have said. it loses its connection every 30 minutes and needs to be restarted.I strongly recommend you not buy this router.
2,Stay Away from BEFW11S4 Version 4,"This router was configured quite easily, but is unable to keep either aim or msn messanger online for more than a couple of mins, also downloads freeze almost always. I would wait until linksys can get the version 4 firmware updated before considering purchasing this item."
1,I'm on my 3rd one in 18 months! BLAH!,"I bought this in Nov 02. Never have I been able to set it up myself. I can generally follow directions, so I think if I need this much help, it's the product. Any time I lose power or the DSL goes out, this wireless router quits working and I have to call Linksys tech support. It's ridiculous. They've already sent me two new ones and they all do the same thing. This is a terribly unrobust product. I am in the process of getting a refund from Linksys and I recommend that you try it, too. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! There are a lot of negative reviews here. Give another company a chance."
3,Great product with updated firmware,"As has been reported in other reviews, I too had several problems with this unit when I first set it up. I could not stay logged onto any of the IM services for more than 2 or 3 minutes without getting kicked off and messages would sometimes be completely lost. I didn't try much downloading but a few smaller downloads (5 MB or less) seemed to work without any hitches. However, after downloading the latest firmware from the Linksys web site (the 1.45.3 beta) everything seems to be working great now. IM services are working flawlessly and I downloaded several large Windows XP update files from Microsoft's web site without any problems. I've given the product 3 stars because of how easy it is to set up and because it works as advertised with the firmware upgrade. If Linksys can get the firmware issue straightened out the product would easily get 5 stars."
3,decent for beginners....I guess,"I finally got it working.....after 12 hours of fumbling around my computers. The tech support wasn't that great. I called them twice and got 2 different tech personnels who were hard to understand. One of them advised me to exchange the unit for a new one because we did not get it working the first time...and he assumed it was a lemon. Well...after my own personal internet research on networking, I figured this thing out somehow. And now it's finally functional. I have 2 computers hooked up with cables. I have yet to try the wireless option with my laptop.Also, I think my personal firewall, Zone Alarm Pro is giving me problems. I might have to disable that. Oh well...more things to sort out."
4,Great for very small home networks.,"Especially good if you want to include a laptop. The wireless feature is adequate, but don't expect truely mobile. Household appliances, brick and metal walls can slow or prohibit transmission. But, it is nice setting up in the next room and surfing the web, and printing on the home priter without hooking up cable each time. Be sure to follow the installation process in the EXACT order reccomended in the manual. I know just enough that I tried to short cut a step or two. Cost me hours of undoing. However, on my other computers I learned my lesson; installation flew through--and the system has never needed any attention from me again."
4,Wireless Router could be better....,"I have a cable connection that I wanted to use in two different rooms. I decided to buy this router along with the wireless Linksys PCI Card to avoid the hassle of running wires through my attic. It was easy to install, but along with the wireless card, the connection is not consistent. The computer that is directly connected to the router is consistently fast, but the computer with the wireless card is sometimes VERY slow. This is just the internet aspect of wireless networking, but I feel it is the most important. Nonetheless, wireless networking is made easy with Linksys's great products, and I would definately recommend it."
3,Works reliably for web browsing only--FTP has problems,"This router was pretty easy to set up and works well with browsing the web, HOWEVER:It has a problem with FTP. I could not use the Win2000 FTP client with this router. It always returns ""Connection Refused"" errors. If I switch to my DLink router, everything works fine. Also, other FTP clients *sometimes* work. I don't like this flakiness. I've tried every reasonable setting imaginable to get FTP to work, but with no luck. HTTP always works fine. I've not tried customer service yet.A feature which is missing from this router is the ability to set static IP address in the DHCP table of the router. My LinkSys router has this feature, which is very handy.The wireless aspect of the router seems to work good. I have my router on the 2nd floor and am able to get a good link from my basement (I'm using a LinkSys PCMCIA wireless card)."
2,Lots of problems but I found one solution,"This router works great for the pcs that are wired directly to it. However, I've had all sorts of problems with wireless connections; everytime I reboot my laptop it takes a few DAYS to get it to connect again! I can reinstall the firmware, reinstall the card (wpc11), format the laptop, it doesn't matter, it still refuses to work. The best I could get was ""you have successfully connected to the access point but the internet cannot be found"". However, once I stopped using dhcp on the laptop (assigned it an ip address and manually entered the gateway and dns numbers for the wpc11) it began working. It works this way but it's aggrivating and does not work when using the router as a dhcp server as it should."
1,A defective product released into the market,"As other people already mentioned, avoid this wireless router with the version number 4. (the one with the picture of only one row of leds on the packaging) I've been a devout user of Linksys, but this time it's very disappointing. The problem is that this router often loses some packets. The download windows often hang and ftp connections are very unstable. Messenger loses connections as well. I don't know how Linksys came to release this kind of product into the market but it makes me sad to watch this product destroying Linksys's brand value. I hope the problems can be settled sooner or later. I'm going to return my router to the local retailer."
1,Beware of firmware updates,"I had (emphasis on had) a befw11s4 ver. 2 router. In an attempt to remedy some strange VPN problems, I tried upgrading to the 1.43.3 firmware. BIG MISTAKE. The update program lost connectivity with the router during the flashing process, resulting in a dead router. I even managed to duplicate this activity on another router just to make sure it wasn't a fluke. A call to their tech support confirmed that this is a problem other users are experiencing, yet the faulty firmware is still available for download. If it works out of the box for you, great. But be careful if you decide to update the firmware."
2,"VPN not supported through wireless, worthless then","The first one I received is a bad one, doesn't work at all, not even the DSL Router part. The second one I got worked, sort of. The configuration program is flaky, crashed often. VPN is not supported over wireless. Very bad, it's worthless then. Get SMC's, it even has a print server. Supports VPN!!"
3,Ram chip,"Received the item very shortly after ordering it, but I never received a software CD with it which i thimk is important to complete the installation of the item in the computer."
2,Routers wih rebates are always buggy,"Till now I've bought 3 routers (D-Link, Netgear and now Linksys). I've always got them when they have rebates offered on them. Now I know that they are refurbished and not worth the money.This router required restarts every 2-3 days and its quite irritating."
5,EXCELLENT,"This is a great piece of hardware. I called tech support for assistance, they answered all of my questions. They stayed on the line to make sure that it worked just right."
4,Happy customer,"I initially had problems getting the unit running, but a friend told me about a software update, which I got at the Linksys website. After that everything worked fine. I had two computers hooked up through cables and two notebooks, no problems. It works so well that I am not aware of it anymore."
3,power to week,This is a great unit with some extra money spent to upgrade it. This unit needs better range it has rptnc connectors and 1 to 2 dbi power and rang killers on it. Try to order 2 5 dbi or 8 dbi anntena to get a all around better unit. great value for 25.00 to 30 .00 then add the 30.00 to fix it out preformes the 54g as far as range and lets get honest in a office yor still cang get more than 5 meg downloads spread that out over 5 comps and theirs no gain with a 54g system the modem limits you to what ever speed you pay for at he line. Enjoy
1,[Firmware] BEFW11S4 - Filed BBB complaint - Linksys sucks,"[Firmware] BEFW11S4 - Filed BBB complaint - Linksys sucksI'm done, put a fork in me. I have been running the BEFW11S4 sucessfully for months on firmware version 1.47.x which I downloaded from dslreports.com. I have started to use MSN Messenger to stay in touch with my the family and it is flaky at best because this old firmware does not contain the fixes I need. I contacted support today and was told, I have tried everything, sorry. Well #$%$#$ Linksys. I will never buy another LINKSYS product as long as I live. I filed a complaint on the better business bureaus website, and I encourage everyone to do the same. www.bbb.org Let your complaints be heard. I am also considering a class action lawsuit against Linksys, anyone interested? Here is my message from their helpdesk:Enriquez, Clarenz: i think you already tried everything to make it work. Enriquez, Clarenz: i'm really sorry about that."
1,Linksys Wireless cable/dsl router,"I ordered this item on 2/6/02, then noticed that it wouldn't be shipped till 2/13/02, and estimated arrival at my residence on 2/20/02. This I feel is very unacceptable, so I was forced to cancel this order and purchase this item locally at a higher price than I wanted to pay.This is unacceptable I feel."
3,"Good product, bad tech support","I am a network admin and have worked with routers before. It took a long time to set it up but once I did it worked very well. The range is great. I live in an all concrete house and my laptop upstairs has no problem getting the router downstairs and the signal is strong.I am having a connection problem of being able to browse from the desktop to the laptop. I explained in my question to tech support that firewall settings are fine, etc.The answer I got was, ""You must disable your firewall to get it to work"". I am not that ignorant. Never disable your firewall.If you know a lot about routers and such it is a good piece of equipment. If you don't, my experience with tech support at Linksys makes me believe the unexperienced should stay away from this router."
4,Good product with some minor problems,"To identify the clients allowed to use the wireless service, user can set the WEP key and/orlock the MAC addresses. However, the setup interface for the client MAC addresses isnot clear. You have to try it few times to understand how it works. The other problemis the disconnection after an idle period. The router will disconnect your connectionssuch as ssh after an idle period. This is not good if you are remotely running long jobs andneed to wait online for the results. For everything else so far, I would say this is a good router."
3,Linksys Wireless 4 Port Router,"I purchased the router and two instant wireless network PC cards after reading several positive reviews. I was up and ruuning in about 25 minutes. I have not tested the extreme limits with the laptops, however it works well anywhere in the house."
1,Mine has died,"Got the original BEFW11S4 in July 2001 from Amazon.com. It had a weak range, but worked well until recently (Nov.2002). In order to use XP's Remote Desktop feature, I had to turn on Port Forwarding. This caused the wireless part of the router to fail, although naturally it took quite a while for me to figure out what happened. I'm not the only one this has happened to... Six emails to tech support (in the Phillipines) before they admitted it was broken. Have to buy a new one. Not Linksys..."
2,Use caution when purchasing this item,"In the past Linksys has made some good switch products. This is not one of them. I am now working with my third BEFW11S4. On the surface it seems like a good product and it is when it works. However, the switch has a problem that causes it to stop forwarding packets periodically. This happens on the RF and wired ports. It will recover on it's own but frequent pauses can be frustrating. I have spoken with Linksys support. They had me try several code releases but the problem remains. I'd like to recommend this product. The price/feature mix is good but I cannot recommend it until Linksys corrects this issue.If you have this product enable outgoing logging. You will quickly see strange and incorrect characters in the log. Since the log is formatted as a routing table might be it makes me wonder if the log data comes straight from the routing table."
1,Frequent disconnects. Bad quality control.,Do not buy this router. The quality is a hit or miss. And there have been quite a few misses now that cannot be ignored anymore. I just wished I read about this first.The router may suddenly fail to work and requires a reboot by unplugging it. This isn't ideal when you have it stuck in a location that is hard to reach. Running the latest .14 release of the firmware (6/2004) and still has the problem. For some it may occur once a month and for some every 30 mins. Please do not even consider this.If you are skeptical about these comments check out the forums in dslreports.com and search for 'post your BEFW11S4 issues'
2,disappointing,"I am well aware of the limitations of wirelss but this was truly disapponiting at 15 feet it was at 30% signalBut what caused me to return it the next day was the extremely poor attitude of the technical support at linksys they didnt even seem to care if it worked or not. I have had this problem previously with thier support, very poor.I would try someone else if I were youi"
1,"Buggy, Buggy, Buggy, Nothing but Problems","This router has been nothing but problems.In short, it hangs on streams and downloads. It also likes to assign IP addresses when you follow the directions to use a fixed IP address.Tech support is useless, suggests adjusting the ""MTU"" and setting a fixed IP address (see above).There are -dozens- of people with these problems. See the issues at DSLReports.com, search for BEFW11S4. Until this is fixed, BUY ANOTHER BRAND."
1,Version 4.....so far bad.,"I have used Linksys routers/hubs for about 4 years (including an earlier version of this model) and have always been very happy with them. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why the internet connection would stop working both on my wired computer and wireless one, I can't even access the internal ""admin"" site. The only fix I found was to unplug the router for a minute and plug back in. Linksys tech support emailed me suggesting to do a ""hard reset"" by1. Unplug the RJ45 and power supply from the router.2. With power off, hold down the reset button and don't let go for about 30 seconds.3. Insert the power cord with the reset button pushed in.4. Wait for the Diag light to come on and go off.Mines already in the box to be sent out back to Amazon. Not willing to wait around for a fix, may try Netgear. Good Luck."
3,Xbox semi-compatible,"I bought this as part of my plan to turn my house into a wireless Xbox paradise. Aside from problems I had with the WET11 (see my review on that item), I later found out that this product cannot support more than one Xbox connected to Xbox Live at a time. I had some inkling that this might be the case, as it's documented on the Xbox Live web site, but I was holding out hope that the more recent firmware releases may have fixed it. I mean, it's LINKSYS! It's THE name in home networking products.Well, there's always hope for the next firmware release."
5,Excellent choice!!,"I bought this Router/Switch to use at home the wireless cards already found in most notebooks.... Everything worked ""out of the box"" as most people state, the only problem I found was with my Dell TrueMobile 1180 Mini-PCI card; to solve it I had to check out Dell's user forums.... After a while I got everything working, but the other cards had no problem (D-Link, 3Com, Netgear, Linksys)... If you're looking for a great value, and also a fast, easy and trouble-free install: Get this product! (BTW, There is a new 802.11g Router/Switch now, though I'd better wait until the final specs are out)"
1,"no range, no support","Forget anything they say about range. Essentially, non existent. Could not get any signal at all from a distance of about 60 feet through a wall. Worked just fine a distance of four feet computer next to unit), but unable to get any signal for other two computers that are upstairs.Support is less than spotty. Long waits, poor english, poor attitude, non existent ability. They did not have a clue. My cable company solved the initial problem in getting the computer next to the unit to work. Problem is with recognizing the MAC number of the router. Five phone calls and not one of the support people suggested this as problem.You get an operator who says someone will call you back. Do not hold your breathe or have anywhere else to go.Finally told by level two support person that range is not what advertised and I could add an access point and maybe it will work, but it will definitely not work at the distance I need (60 feet through one wall)"
2,Piece of s,"It is a good looking router, to say the least ... but it just goes downhill from there. I just wrote a 2 page letter to LinkSys stating my disappointment. I would *never* usually do something like that, but had such a bad experience with their tech support. Setting up a router, no problem. Troubleshooting it when @Home keeps knocking you off? Well, let's just say their tech support said ""...I would go out and buy another"" after we couldn't get the firmware upgrade to stick.Sad, but true. I'm taking that guy's advice. I suggest you do, too."
4,Simple and Quick,Simple Quick and Easy to use.. Half the time I forget it's there. A nice piece of equipment you will forget you own because you'll never need to look at it or touch it.I even went with the default config just to make it that much easier.. I just opened the box and added electricity.. DONE.
2,"Barely usable, unstable and constantly aggravating","I've been using this Linksys wireless router for over a year, so I've got some experience with it. In a word: terrible. Sure, sometimes you can manage to get a wireless signal, but otherwise it'll suddenly drop for no reason, then refuse to let you reconnect. Unplugging it and plugging it back in might help, but who wants to do that a half dozen times a day just to maintain a constant connection?I've tried all the workarounds, from updating the firmware to using a secure connection - and nothing really helps. Oh, and when I do get a stable connection, it's horrendously slow. Somehow, as the connection goes through the cable modem to the router and then to my laptop's wireless card, the speed is reduced to dialup sometimes.I would not recommend this product, unless you regularly purchase electronics as a means of masochism."
1,"Not bad, if you happen to get one that works!","I've now owned two of these, and neither worked properly. The first worked great, as long as you were within 20 feet and direct line-of-sight to the device. To Linksys' credit, their tech support line worked well with me to diagnose that the device was bad and issue a merchandise credit. The second one I owned worked fine for about a month before the wireless capability stopped working altogether. I suppose I could work Linksys again and get another merchandise credit (and cross my fingers it will work), but I think I'll just buy a NetGear device instead."
2,Linksys router and card are not up to its reputation,"I bought this router and a Linksys wireless card 1-1/2 years ago. The router crapped out at the end of its 1-year warranty and they sent me a replacement. It lasted 6 months and crapped out, but since my total warranty period was 1-year, I have to buy a new router. The wireless card lasted until a month ago and I replaced it with a Belkin card with a ""lifetime"" warranty. Linksys Tech support was exported to India and they try but the language problem is there. I will not buy Linksys products again."
4,READ THIS IF YOUR Ver.4 ROUTER STOPPED WORKING!,"After I upgraded the firmware and loaded Windows XP Service Pack 2 this trusty router which had served me well for over a year (maybe almost 2 years?...can't remember) suddenly started dropping its connection to the internet. SOUND FAMILIAR? After tearing my hair out, talking to Linksys tech support 5 times and scanning the internet for solutions I finally thought why not try an earlier firmware revision (as except every few days or so, it would lose connection and then I'd have to unplug and replug in the power supply but lately it was happening after 15 minutes). So that's what I did. I just happened to have firmware revision 1.5.10 still saved on my computer. So I reinstalled that and voila! I've been up now for over 2 hours. We'll see if it works. Anyway, seems to be a problem with the firmware revision as far as I can tell."
4,Works for me!,"I had no problem switching from my hard line linksys router to the wireless. In fact, I am sitting in my backyard on my new notebook writing this. (See my review of the HP zt3010us) Even if you are a newbee to networks, you shouldn't have any problem IF you use the set-up disc; just follow the instructions and you will be on your way!Two notes of advice: 1) Do NOT set up your aol (if you have it) first before you set up you wireless on a new notebook. Lots of retracing my steps to connect to the internet. Set up the network first then worry about aol. 2) Set up the WEP so your neighbors won't find your connection when they turn on their new wireless notebook! Go into the device manager and follow the steps.RuShep"
5,Exactly want I expected,"This router is very easy to setup and works great. I must admit I was a bit skeptical about what the quality of my connection would be throughout my house, but the router is two floors above me right now and my Cable connection is still very fast with a signal strength of 80% and higher. Since my router is in the back of the house on the top floor, my signal strength on my front porch isn't very good at all. On either side of the house and in my back yard however I still get 60% to 90% signal strength. Overall the system was very easy to setup, works like a charm indoors, and depends on the placement of the router for outdoor use. I would definitely purchase it again."
1,Firmware Upgrade is buggy and Tech Support is non-existent,"I've been using this product for about 6 months and was relatively happy until I upgrade my firmware per recommendation on the Linksys web site. Now I can not enable a static IP address as the web interface has a bug that won't let you submit your changes. All other menus work fine, but this is the one I really need.I called customer service and was told the wait would be 32 minutes. After 150 minutes I was still on hold! This is completely unacceptable and the issue is still unresolved making this a 300 paper weight."
1,Lousy,"The wireless intermittently cuts out completely (ie, the lights on the front indicate it is no longer providing wireless service), the port-forwarding completely broke in the latest version of the firmware, there are no docs for the updated firmware, even though the web interface has changed and added new features, and the docs have no information for using the router with anything other than Windows.Rotten, lousy, piece of garbage. The last Linksys product I'll ever own, that's for sure."
1,Bad router,"I bought this router in the hope of using the internet on my laptop antwhere in my two storied house. I use a linksys wireless card in the laptop.It turns out that as soon as the laptop leaves the room where the router is located and the door is closed, the receiving signal goes down to nothing.Tech support from Linksys by email said that this product only works in ""line-of sight"", while that is not mentioned on the package.For me a waste on money."
3,"Good at the beginning, bad after a month...","I had no trouble to use this device out of the box and worked great for a month or so. After that, the wireless radio began to disconnect ramdonly. Called Linksys Tech Support and were very professional with the trobleshooting and the attention. After that, they got me a RMA number and sent the device to their Warranty Department. I got the replacement unit, in fact, the same unit I sent and after 15 minutes, I got the same issue... wireless constantly lost connectivity and sometimes the access point dissapears from the network. Very bad experience, having in mind I expected after a couple of weeks of waiting a fixed device. Now I have a [price] paperweight... I really trusted in Linksys and now feel defrauded... All my network adapters are from them."
1,Support bad; no firmware upgrades,"It is not clear if this is a v1 or v2 system. The v1 has not received firmware upgrades for a long time now, altough it is still being sold. Essentially, Linksys has dropped support, concentrating on the newer v2.Here are two things to consider: (1) you don't know whether you will get a v1 or v2, and if you get the old one you are stuck (like me -- and they will not replace for a v2) and (2) if they treat their v1 customers this way, do you think they would do it also to their v2 customers?D-Link has fabulous products, so does Speedstream and SMC and Belkin."
2,Poor reception and speed.,"I recently purchased this router with the Linksys WPC11 notebook adapter. Setup was simple for both the router and the network adapter. However, the signal was poor. It would spike, and then drop to zero. Often times I couldn't connect with the router at all and when I did, download speeds on my broadband connection were worse than a dial up connection. I tried switching through the different channels to no avail. I have cordless phones, but they were not in the room or in operation when I was trying to setup my connection. Needless to say, if they interfered when not in use, I wouldn't want to keep this product anyway. I didn't bother to call tech support. Instead, I packed it up and sent it back. ..."
1,YUCK,"Ad is misleading. Item is 4-5 years old,not ""like new"", one antenna is missing a cover and there was no power unit as described. Seller offers to buy it back shipping at my expense which I see as unfair"
2,Pete,I was unsatisfied with this purchase the co. selling didnot diclose that it din't have an insalation CD that made impossible to install. Never again
5,"Great product, easy install!","Great deal for a good router. First I just plugged it all in and everything just worked from the start, no problem. Then I went into the web setup and everything is pretty simple. It just works on its own - all you gotta do is change the setup password.Wireless works great, too, although I mostly use it through wires. I networked two computers without many problems and I'm very satisfied.Just a word of advice - set up MAC filtering and don't broadcast the SSID for wireless if you don't want your neighbors stealing your connection. Many people tend to overlook the setup utility once they plug it in and everything works, and then they wonder why their connection is acting up."
1,These routers do not work,"I bought two of these routers brand new, and a family member bought one as well. ALL 3 of them are defective. If a computer on the network reboots, the routers compeltely shut down. Also many services, like email, would not work through the router. It makes little sense. But these routers are junk, they simply won't work, and I reccomend everyone AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS. You might as well go buy a brick, it will work just as well on your network. (NOT AT ALL!)"
3,wireless functionality stopped working after one year,A good product but not built to last. Wireless capablities stopped working after 13 months. Conveniently after the warranty was up. Linksys advise was to but a new unit.
4,Impressive tech service,This product didnt work with my Toshiba Cable modem. I called up tech support and the support technician guided me through a router chaining set-up. The tech support is really impressive.
4,It works for me!,"I recently purchased the Linksys 4 port Cable/DSL Router for my home. The router and software installed easily on my desktop system straight from the ""quick install guide."" Software configurations were a breeze. After the installation, I fired up my Dell laptop with its wireless adapter and it auto found the Linksys router. Easy! In and around my house the connection strength is pretty good, most of the time running at maximum speed. Moving about 75 feet from the router, with 3 interior walls between the speed drops about 2/3. Overall I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to others."
1,Linksys Wireless Router Unusable in Wireless mode,"I bought the Linksys Wireless 4-port Cable/DSL Router and 2 WMP11 cards. The router worked fine with direct CAT5 connections, but totally failed with wireless connections using the WMP11 cards. 2.5 hours on the phone with Linksys support did not solve the problem. I eventually solved it myself, but Internet connection speeds went down 100x, from 1.5Mbps to 12Kbps. Distance from PC to router was 18 inches, and signal strength was 100%. I am returning the equipment."
1,Don't waste your money,"I work hard for my money, most people do. And nothing ticks me off more than feeling completely ripped off. This router is a piece of junk, and its not just the wireless function that is a joke--connecting directly to the ports via cat5 cable won't help either. If you are a casual web surfer going here and there, then you might get away with this product. If you download anything more than 1 MB of data at any given moment then walk away. Don't look back. Buy something else. Trust me. It keeps timing out every minute. Looses the connection completely and your downloading software (or streaming media player) can't restart the connection automatically so you have to do it over and over again. I ran a diagnostic broadband speed test and comparing being jacked directly into my cable modem vs. using the wireless or wired function from the router, I get 1/3 the bandwidth if it works at all. READ ALL THE OTHER BAD REVIEWS, I AGREE WITH ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THEM. Buy something else."
2,Linksys Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router,"We had the router set up with two wired desktop computers and one wireless laptop. For some reason the router would only allow either both wired machines, or one wired one wireless, connect to the internet at any given time. Linksys tech support figured it was a bad router, but upon replacement the new one did the same thing. Very strange indeed. One unhappy customer."
4,Works fine in my home,"I used Linksys USB connections to two laptops. I have one pc workstation directly connected. Performance has been fine throughout the house. Everything installed quickly and ran as expected.I have had to reset the router when all three PCs were in use at times, but this has not been a big problem.I was able to configure my firewall to protect all three PCs behind the firewall and share files and printing in my home lan."
4,"even a dummie like me, can set it up.","Ok, just got it yesterday and hooked it up in under 10 minutes. Now, read the instructions, but really just put the cd-rom in your drive and follow the prompts. Do not forget to wear a white shirt and tie, and ill fitting chinos, so you look like the geek from your office. Now the important stuff. The cards for the other computers take a little longer, but don't give up. Now my house has 3 desktops (2pcs and an Apple)., plus my Jornada 720 clogging up the internet. HANG TEN!! and have a great summer"
3,"Have two, still wonder what to do","I purchased two routers and a PCMCIA networking card. One router worked out of box. The only negaive aspect is the relatively short range inside the building (going from 100% connectivity in the same room to 20% connectivity two walls and less than 50 ft away. Second router did not work, I replaced it with a third one that still does not work. I am updating it every new revision, it works for a short period and then failures start to surface. It seems that the Linksys team, that otherwise has good products, had a production mess with this model. Buy the units while you are mentally strong and love life and get an extra warranty for it."
2,Fails after months of use,"I have noticed this router typically begins to fail after 6 months of use. By fail, I mean it starts dropping connections and has trouble reconnecting to the WAN.A router should not have to be reset (or unplugged) every day. IT should just be plugged in and work constantly.My router started getting flaky after a year, but my mother has gone through two of these in one year.I think its time Linksys get to addressing their customer's concerns."
2,"Sometimes great, sometimes very unstable","I use this device for DHCP and NAT between my DSL router and my other wired and wireless machines. Sometimes it works great, and I have no wireless coverage problems.Other times, it seems to have major DHCP issues. It will hand out the same IP address to wired and wireless computers, or it will just drop the wireless connection and has to have the power pulled in order to fix the problem (which also disrupts connectivity for the wired users). I've recently upgraded firmware, but that hasn't helped.I would not buy another device from this manufacturer if (when) I replace it."
1,Worst computer add on that I have ever bought. JUNK!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst product for the computer routers that you can buy. This router crashes on you all the time. When you call for technical support the people that you are talking to you cant understand because they are from India and also they do not know how to help you anyway because they are idiots. You can never talk to a supervicior or someone from in the United States. I called once and the person asked me for my address, home phone, and social security number. Why is the social needed? I did not give them that and when I said that they could not have that they would not help more they just said that they do not have follow the US laws becuase they are not in the US. I finally got someone in the US after thretening with the BBB. The router that I have is a replacement already and it is just CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!I hope that this review is helpful and that you will make the wise decision. (don't buy it!!!!!!!!)"
1,An abysmal product,"I have had this Linksys router for about a year, and it has been a living nightmare! It constantly drops the signal and has to be reset, and it stopped working altogether one day. After two hours on the phone with Linksys tech support, I was able to get the Ethernet ports working again - but not the wireless. I've commiserated with many others who've had nothing but trouble with their Linksys wireless products.Now I have a new D-Link wireless router, and it works great. It took me less than a half hour to set up and get running with all three of my laptops (including using WEP security), and the signal from the D-Link router is much stronger throughout my house than the Linksys ever was. I couldn't be happier now that I've ditched the Linksys!"
2,Died 1 Month After Warranty,"Exactly 22 days after 1 year warranty it died. Of course Linksys made no exception. Technical support is hit or miss, but mostly miss. Good experience with their adapters, however,...so far."
1,Drops all connections every 30 minutes,"Purchased this device Dec 2003. This device was easy to set up however consistently after 30 minutes it will drop all connections. It requires that you power the device down, then power it back up every 30 minutes for it to work. During that 30 minutes it works just great never drops connections, great connectivity.I have gone through multiple iterations with Linksys support. They were all focusing on reducing the speed at which the connection worked on. To no avail.Tech support is useless. They are aware that this is a problem in a huge portion of the items that they ship, but have no solution to it.I have a standard Linksys cable router as well and it has worked flawlessly for 3 years. I am very dissapointed in this product.When I search on the web for other people with this problem it looks like there are thousands in the same boat."
4,Happy Wireless User,"I bought this Router because of its popularity. Installing it was quite easy. At first the response was very very poor when I put the router right next to the cable modem on top of the PC. After I put it on the floor, the response time is very good. I am still not sure if it is the PC or the cable modem that causes the problem. The help section however doesn't tell you about things like this. Since many people have spoken negatively about the wireless LinkSys PC card for the laptop, I have decided to buy the one from Netgear. It installs easily with no problem on my Windows 2000 laptop. It works very well too. When I tested the speed, it exceeds the cable modem published rate, amazing. My laptop usually sits downstairs while the router sits upstairs with my desktop. It's true that the signal varies depending on where you use the laptop. I am a happy WIRELESS camper. With rebate and everything, it only costs me ... I got the whole package from Amazon in less than 5 days."
4,all's well so far,"I received this router as a replacement for a faulty 2wire Home PNA router given to me by my ISP. It was not difficult to set up but I could see how a networking novice might find the instructions a bit obscure and confusing. I was very impressed that the signal from the unit is strong from the basement where it is set up to my laptop two floors up. I used a Linksys USB wireless adapter to hook up my kid's computer and it worked quite easily. So far, so good."
1,Will never buy linksys any more,"1. Wireless connection is not smooth at all. Keep getting stuck. Have to manually reset it quite often.2. Have been updating new firmware whenever a new one is available. Hoping the quality would improve. However, with every new firmware, the quality seems gettign worse.3. Now, after 8 month of troublesome experience, the wireless signal is totoally gone. Both my laptop, pda cannot identy a wireless signal at all. Have to call linsys to replace one tomorrow.I won't buy linksys anymore!"
5,Great product backed up by great tech support :o),"Having recently gone through the frustrating process of purchasing DSL (I won't name any names) I may be prejudiced by the relative ease and positive tech-support experience I have had so far with the wireless router and adapter.I have been up and running for about 3 weeks with only one glitch that has required me to call tech support for help. Wait times are not long at all and the tech support people are patient, knowledgeable, and ultimately very helpful.Happy and satisfied with my purchase thus far :o)"
3,You will need your own ISP other than AOL,At this time no router will work with AOL-DSL. Yet it will workwith Verizon or other DSLs. Though AOL says they'll come out with their own router within 4 weeks(late July 2002). yET NOBODY WILL TELL YOU IT WON'T WORK WITH AOL. It's AOLs fault yet they should tell you anyways before accepting your money.
2,Not for Macintosh Users,"I do not recommend the Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router(WC/D router) for Macintosh users for the following reasons. 1. The WC/D router comes with a CD that contains instructions and video to help the user install the product. The CD didn't work on a Mac. 2. The manual contains details for the configuration of Windows networking, but no instructions for the configuration of the Macintosh TCP/IP control panel. 3. Firmware upgrades are only provided as Windows executables. When I contacted Linksys to tell them how disappointed I was in their Macintosh support, I received no reply."
2,Piece of junk,"I was a previous owner of the Linksys 1 port DSL router, and it worked fine. When I upgraded to this system, trying to use it with Pacific Bell DSL service, forget it! I've spent DAYS trying to get it to work - and actually had it working for most of one day (once). But all in all, this is a piece of crap. I think I'm going to sell mine on ebay and buy a netgear."
5,Dreamy,Set it up and connected a wireless USB connector to my TIVO in under 10 minutes. Worked like a dream with little to no adieu. Dreamy.
3,Good router though Released too soon..,This router works great as long as you dont need to download files larger than say... er.. 300k. Most all large file downloads stall. Once it stalls the progam I'm using to download the file freezes also so I need to shut that down. If Im lucky I'll sometimes I'll be able to get a 3mb file downloaded.I've contacted Linksys and they told me to try different MTU settings. Each time I tried a different setting it seemed to fix the problem for a little while but it was only an illusion.Hopefully Linksys releases a new Firmware version to fix this problem.Hey for [the money]it's still not a bad deal for a wireless router even though it does not work quite right.I say wait a month and see if they release a fix for this problem. If you need a router ASAP then pick another one. I have a Netgear MR314 that works wonderfully.
2,underinformed,"I bought this item with great expectation of sitting out on my back patio with my laptop, surfing the web unincumbered by wires and modems. This after two months of trying, has turned out to be nothing but a fantasy. Not only is the system difficult to install, but I find that my DSL provider will not support any router that isnt supplied by them and therefore this whole system is now unusable. So beware consumer. Check with your provider to see if they can support the new hardware youre buying."
1,I thought routers were supposed to hold your connection?,"Overall, this was the worst purchase I have ever made in my entire life.1) It doesn't hold my connection, it dies out at a *MAX* after 2 hours of it working.2) Whenever I make a router change it takes longer to propogate then ANY router I have ever seen.3) The httpd on it dies SO fast, usually even before I get to make a change on the router configuration.4) Oh my god, I thought this router was Wireless?!Across the hall in the next room my Laptop is at 0%-3% signal on this thing.Overall, go D-Link [the Wireless Router with 3 Port Switch that they made]Good luck."
2,Is there a good router?,"I've had this router for about a year and a half. About a year into it I lost the ability to DHCP. Later it came back. Now it just drops the connection unless you go static in which case you lose about half of your packets.I have the latest firmware, so there's no excuse. Another reviewer mentioned that someone said they were having firmware issues. That was a few months ago. Totally unacceptable. I will never again buy a LinkSys or Cisco product.The only reason I've given this hunk of junk two stars is that the configuration is easy and still functional enough to setup some port filters (five ranges). Although, I wish you could filter a lot more."
1,Wireless with windows XP is a mess,"It was a piece of cake to get this set up for my mother with a Mac and a Windows 2000, both on wireless. Then she bought a laptop with Windows XP professional and everything went to hell. We managed to get wireless set up, but the connection was extremeley flaky -- it kept on dropping and we got page not found errors. A search on google brought up a host of newsgroup discussion of problems with firmware. They say that the latest revisions of the firmware are worse than earlier ones. We eventually got the connection to be a bit more stable, but now we get periodic messages saying, ""One or more wireless networks is available. To see the networks, click here"" and have to click connect to keep our connection (after an annoying delay). I'm about to order a different router from Amazon and toss this one in the trash. This review is my penance for not taking the trouble to ship this back to Linksys and make them give me a refund or a new one."
4,the software makes it easy,"The CD you get with the hardware makes the whole process so simple. I had to get this with my ATTbi, according to the ISP. I initially tried to use another brand with my ATTbi, but it failed to work. I don't have my network certification, nor do I really work with networks...so this was a snap to connect & get connected with our laptop which receives the wireless transmission via a Linksys USB Network Adaptor."
2,Drops Internet Connection Frequently,"I've had this router for 6 months now and have spent countless hours/days/weeks/months trying to fix an intermittent Internet connection loss both on the PC to which it is hard-wired and a wireless connected PC. Power recycling corrects the problem temporarily, but in another 2-4 days one of the PCs loses connection again. I have tried reconfiguring varous ways, e.g., static addresses, dynamic addresses, etc. to no avail.So, how is it when it operates correctly? Fine on the hard-wired PC; however, the speed on the wireless connected PC is less than half the speed of the hard-wired one. Unfortunately that machine is Window 98 and needs a B-wireless unit.Bottomline: its better than nothing and does the job for my little 2-PC network. BUT, I would not buy this for any SERIOUS network."
2,Dont waste your time on it!,"I have had this router for nearly 3 months and I have reinstalled it 10 times! It crashes everytime when streaming video/music because its default setting of Windows Media Player has to be turn off, and yet it is not mentioned in the manul(At least I did not find it!).Anyway,if you want to buy something reliable and stable, avoid this!"
4,Not bad at all!,I bought this product when it was on sale at bestbuy. It is a good product but goes down once a month and you have to restart it. The signal is good around the apartment. I like the web configuration interface. Overall I recommend it.
1,Constantly Dropping Internet Connections-Do Not BUY,"Do your own research, google ""linksys sucks"", or go to any number of geek forums. This router can not hold a internet connection up for any length of time. It drops the connect spradically as well as constantly when trying to download music or music videos. Tech support is clueless. Basically you get what you pay for, crap!!!!!"
2,Mixed experience,"Installation was smooth, and I was up and running in minutes. This device solved the problem of the horrible PPOE driver from my DSL provider (SBC/SNET) that didn't work. I was initially excited about the connectivity, but the wireless range is poor. I have a wood frame house, and I seem to drop the connection as soon as I get about 35 feet from the router. However, I'm usually within 25 feet, and connectivity there is good."
2,linksys,"this is no good. we have one set up, and the two computers are not even that far away. The one that is linked directly works fine, but every once and a while the other one (which is separated from the original by one floor and one room) cuts out a lot. It just stops receiving the signal. This can last a few minutes, or a few weeks, and there seems to be nothing you can really do to make work. Other than that, when it is working properly, it works great. It's very fast. If only it worked all the time, it would be great."
2,Unstable wireless connectivity,"It works fine with wired connection. However, wireless connection is not stable at all. It either drops the wireless signal, or lock up network connection on wireless side. Tried several firmware upgrades and downgrades, still no help. Will return the unit and get refund."
2,"Very very poor range, sent it back","After about 2 hours with linksys support, they decided the router portion of the product was bad. (Unlike other reviews about support, I had a good experience with support, they worked the entire 2 hours.) After exchanging the defective one for a new one, it took no more than 5 minutes to have 4 computers networked and talking to each other. I was so excited to have my laptop connected to the network and DSL with the Linksys wireless card and working great. The excitement quickly vanished when I walked 10 feet away from the access point and the signal dropped to 50%(clear line of sight) about 25 feet away, through 2 walls, the signal and connection quality was poor or non-existent if I moved my hand or arm in front of the card. I couldn't use the wireless feature throughout my house, let alone outside. I took both the BEFW11S14 and the card back. Have a Netgear system on order, hopefully it will work better."
1,Just didn't work,"I buy a lot on Amazon. I review only the great disappointments. This purchase was one. It simply didn't work. I could ping the router for only a minute or two before the connection would die. If you cannot sustain a connection to the router, then you have no access to the network. . . . Plain bad. Avoid."
3,Delivers on versatility but there is a performance price,"I have mixed feelings on this product. It performed the functions as advertised but I wasn't expecting some of the performance issues. My cable speed direct before installing this system was about 1100 Kbps and it dropped to about 750 when delivering through the router by hardwire. The wireless laptop operating through one wall and about 20 feet away was only seeing 350 or 400 Kbps. In addition each time a new browser window was open there was a 20 to 25 second delay before it hit the home site, that response virtually immediate before the router install. I found these to be compromises I couldn't live with but I'm picky about online speed. Your mileage may vary"
5,Great product - Easy Install - Solid Customer Service,"Just bought this today, along with the PCMCIA laptop card and I couldn't be happier. Am laying in bed typing this review now that I've been freed from sitting in the home office. The installation was almost flawless -- the router set up worked pretty much as plug and play. My only difficulty came in getting the laptop to receive the reception from the base. I called the toll free Linksys #, had to wait about 15 minutes on hold, but the rep was fantastic and had me fixed up in less than 5 minutes. The reception in the house has been more than adequate and the freedom of going wireless and still having access to files on my desktop is fantastic.Pros:* Fast and easy installation* Toll free customer service* Great price/value ratioCons:* Guides could have been more updated, but they were adequate"
1,It's good as long as it works...,I have had two of these exact routers now and both of them broke. Both had internal hardware failures and the year warranty just ran out so I'm out of luck. Customer support's only solution was to unplug and plug it back in.
1,just plain awful,"Set this up on a desktop running Windows 2000 and a laptop running Windows XP. The setup utility that came with the linksys was just awful, it was difficult to setup, the configuration did not work with XP, and new drivers were needed that still don't work properly.By comparison, an install with dlink went seemlessly and has performed without fault from the start. In my opinion, I'd go with the d-link everytime..."
4,"Good, but still has some way to go",This item is not for the plug and play user. Even with 15 years networking experience it was somewhat difficult to get all the features working though most users will not need them. Utilizing static ip addresses can be a hassle if you do not know how to obtain DNS information from your local provider. Also i believe Linksys over states its range for the RF side an should give realistic ranges. I have lost contact in as short as 60 feet and again that depends on the structure of the facility just dont expect 300.
1,Stay away from Linksys,"WARNING - STAY AWAY OF LINKSYS WIRELESS ROUTERSI've encountered nothing but problems with 3 different units. The first unit had very poor signal strength and quality. The next two units kept dropping, on average, 75% of the IP packets. How can you surf the web if your browser keeps timing out...I'll never purchase another Linksys product again eventhough I will say that the support and service is good. ..."
2,Decent But Buggy Router,"This is the 2nd Linksys router my family has used over the years. This router does work well out of the box and supports wireless, which works pretty much out of the box as well. However, I have to take 2 stars off for lack of stability, ESPECIALLY with recent firmware upgrades. With the last 2 upgrades, this router has been prone to locking up randomly at least 2-3 times a week. I have yet to find a solution presented by Linksys for the lock-ups."
1,disposable router,"I bought this model for my home network. It completely died and I can't get any decent service from Linksys.com. When I call them on the phone, all you get is some unintelligible operator with a heavy foreign accent who was obviously given that job to keep decent folk with legitimate complaints at bay. Unless you are into disposable routers, stay away from all things Linksys! Otherwise, I have a used one that I would like to sell."
3,Wow is the setup software complicated!,"Once this is installed, it works. Wireless connections slow quickly as distance from the unit increases, but it does work.A wirelessly connected laptop that is usually operated one story downstairs and two rooms away (about 40 feet straightline) from the router unit usually connects at 2MBPS. While that is not near the 11MBPS advertised maximum, it's still 4x faster than a good dial up connection. (Walls and distance decrease wireless connection speeds.) Hardwired nodes consistently have fast connection speeds.Setting up the software to get the network running is very complex, and documentation is only fair- at best. I finally had a technician from CompUSA come to my home."
2,Do you really need wireless in the home ?,"It may be cheaper to CAT5 wire the home before you experiment with wireless. I have had several frustrating hours on the phone with Linksys support - all have tried to help but end up with suggesting I return the unit, which I guess I will do one more time as wireless home networking is such a good idea ! Problems seem to be in getting wireless-equipped notebooks talking to the hub - hard wired connections to the hub work fine. It just didn't work even after endless configuration checks of all units. If someone has this unit working with a WPC11 card equipped device, I wish they'd share how they did it."
1,Think twice if you intend to use it with Apple products,"I have used this product for almost a year and I have spent way too many hours trying to make the firmware work with my Apple systems. The latest upgrade (2-04) won't even allow you to save essential settings using a browser on Mac OS system 10.3.x. If you don't mind trying to find a pc or a software fix to simply change essential settings, then it might keep working long enough to make it worth an investment under $50. Otherwise, if you have Macs find a Mac-friendly solution."
5,Works exactly as expected,"I started with a computer (a laptop) connected to a cable modem and a printer connected to the computer. Lots of wires and no mobility.I installed the router to the cable modem, installed the wireless adapter in the computer and connected the wireless print server to the printer.I now have a completely wireless apartment. The technology worked exactly as I expected and the result is a great improvement in the way I use my technology. The total installation time couldn't have been an hour. No options, not much software: everything just worked and I got exactly what I wanted.I highly recommend the whole setup. I wouldn't ever go back to the old wired way of doing things. Ever.P.S. ""B"" speed is perfectly adequate; ""G"" is faster, but since it's also faster than the cable modem, there doesn't seem to be much point for a small home network. The printer works just fine at ""B"" speeds, as does the computer. Why pay more, particularly when the standard isn't yet fully approved?"
2,Wireless version of a great product dissapoints,"I bought a Linksys router a few years ago, and upgraded to this model after getting a new laptop with wireless capability. I enjoy the convenience of wireless, but miss the stability of my old Linksys. The only difference I've seen between the two in features and functionality is the wireless part.Otherwise, they do the same basic things - connect to the internet via cable or DSL, and provide internet access to multiple machines through DHCP. Only my wireless router doesn't do those basic functions nearly as well.I have to unplug the power to the router frequently to get it to reconnect to the internet (daily lately), and sometimes it just stops broadcasting a wireless signal.Pay attention to the reviews by people who have owned the product for a while. Yes, setup is easy. Tech support may be great. But reliability in the long run just isn't there."
3,Great product with updated firmware,"= Great product with updated firmwareReviewer: An electronics fan from Yonkers, NY USAAs has been reported in other reviews, I too had several problems with this unit when I first set it up. I could not stay logged onto any of the IM services for more than 2 or 3 minutes without getting kicked off and messages would sometimes be completely lost. I didn't try much downloading but a few smaller downloads (5 MB or less) seemed to work without any hitches. However, after downloading the latest firmware from the Linksys web site (the 1.45.3 beta) everything seems to be working great now. IM services are working flawlessly and I downloaded several large Windows XP update files from Microsoft's web site without any problems. I've given the product 3 stars because of how easy it is to set up and because it works as advertised with the firmware upgrade. If Linksys can get the firmware issue straightened out the product would easily get 5 stars."
2,Only allows one wireless connection at a time,The router works fine but oddly only allows one wireless connection at a time. Upgrading the firmware failed so I returned the product. This is hardware from around 2004 so maybe this isn't surprising. Kudos to the vendor (lakeplacegames) for promptly issuing a refund.
3,infuncional without a CD,"perhaps 5 days to install it and not to be able to do it are much lost one of time, to others can serve to them, but I believe that besides knowledge, it needed a CD, because when you enter the page Cisco Web, they want cobrarte too much money by any thing, I better create sera to think it and to buy something new .....it sends in the end it of return for back."
3,Not too bad,"I tried the cisco linksys router and found at first that the router didn't connect. Then after tinkering with it, I got it to work. However, with some computers the wired interface still didn't work right."
3,Quality control lacking,"Ordered this through Dell about a month ago. I had been using a Dell wireless router for nearly six months, but when we began having some connection speed problems, Dell said it NEVER should have worked with Charter Pipeline (my cable provider). They recommended I buy the Linksys wireless router. After trying several times unsuccessfully to get it up and running myself, I spent the whole afternoon on a Saturday on the phone with Linksys tech support to finally determine that the hardware I had was faulty. After replacement, it has now worked quite well and actually was easy to setup. I am going to try to set up a wireless print server also."
4,"Tastes great, less filling!","The Quick Start Guide could be a tad less obscure, but overall this product does everything the manufacturer claims at an attractive price. Highly recommended."
3,"Usually reliable, reasonable speed.","I've had this router for several years now and it's served admirably. Occasionally I have to reset it, but it's infrequent enough to be OK. The speed is quite good for a B router, but these days with G and even early versions of N standard available, you should only buy this router if you're REALLY on a tight budget."
3,router setup,router connections to computer and internet is easy. what's not easy is finding the right codes and IP addresses for your setup.
1,Do NOT use with XP or MSN,"I ordered this, plus the USB wireless adapter, because I heard it was easy to use. After 15+ hours on the phone with tech support with Linksys and after the 30 day return policy expired, it became clear that it wasn't going to work, although no one knows why (both computers are brand-new and the DSL connection works great on its own). Linksys claimed that there's something with MSN that changes the configuration, but no one could tell us what the right one was, and every time something would work, something else would go wrong. We spent several lost weekends working on this and our blood pressure shot up exponentially, and Linksys has only offered us a credit with them, not our money back. This products are absolutely TERRIBLE and we wouldn't wish them on anyone."
2,wireless function failed in under 1 year,"I experienced the same problem that other reviewers have reported. The wireless portion of the router stopped working after only 10 months. The wired connections and router function still work fine. Linksys is replacing the unit since is still under warranty, but it is very inconvenient to be without my router while I return it to the manufacturer and wait for the replacement."
1,Not a bargain at half the price,"This product lasted two months, then the wireless stopped working. I will say that tech support was helpful with the initial setup and configured (they had to be, as the documentation for the ""advanced features"" is non-existent). Be sure to ask about the ""MAC Address Clone"" feature if you are connecting through a cable modem through which you have already connected via your computer. I, too had the frustration of sending this thing back to Linksys at my own expense and waiting 2 weeks to see it again. It is good at working *sometimes*, but if you need reliable wireless connectivity, and download often, look elsewhere. This unit for me has ""locked up"" every couple of hours if I am downloading or transferring files."
2,AVOID VERSION 4 of this router at this time,"Okay, I've been hunting for a wireless router for a long time. This one looked wonderfully promising, but after 3 weeks of random lockups (after which you must unplug the power cord and reinsert it to get it to respond) in which the PC thinks the router is dead, I'm pulling my hair out.I've read on several Broadband discussion sites that this is a VERY COMMON problem with the BEFW11S4 router VERSION 4. Apparently, version 2 and 3 are fine, but 4 (which is what is currently sold in the US) has some flaws they still have not resolved.Most recent firmware you say? Alas! I have installed it and same thing still happens. Other folks suggested a new beta version of the firmware, but it still has lockup issues too.I would say if you can grab a version 2 or 3 of this router, by all means. But unless you like unplugging your router twice a day to get it unstuck, avoid it until they fix the firmware. As of July 1st, it is still unresolved.-Jim"
1,Communication Roulette,"I was one of the unlucky v4 owners. I had the router facing the wall to make it easier to pull the power and reset it, which I was doing constantly (3 hours of uptime was the best I could get). I always had to do a reset to start the day. It wouldn't even work as a wired, pass-through router. Finally, I searched the web and found out that I had LOTS of company. I replaced it with the equivalent Netgear router, which after a week has never required to be reset. I run Windows XP Pro and ZoneAlarm firewall, so don't believe those excuses, either. Amazon should really allow negative stars - 1 is WAY too generous."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!,"Yes, this Wireless router is garbage. If the signal does stay up for any length of time, it will be cut off by nearby cell phone, cordless phones, microwave ovens etc.I have had mine for 90 days, and now am unble to return it. Stay wired!!!!I would not advise this as a purchase."
5,Easy to install,"I spent all of 10 minutes installing this router. I have never installed one before and thought it was going to be a job. Most of the time was spent reading the instructions. The instructions were very easy to follow.If you are considering a wirless network, this one works well and was easy to install. I am running Windows XP in case you were wondering."
5,Another variety of great breads!,I can't give these series enough praise. The instructions are easy to follow and implement.
2,Not bad,"I had most of the tracks just like a few, but its a good cd. Wish we had radio disney in Australia."
4,Kids and parents love it!,This is a fun CD for kids and their parents. Watch out though; the Hamster Dance Song gets stuck in you head!!!
3,Good If You Want The Music Videos,"Radio Disney Ultimate Jams sounds like a great compilation of songs, but these songs are already on jams 1 - 6, which is good if you already own those volumes. The only reason they did this was to put out the music videos that never came with volumes 1 - 6. You'd be paying for the same songs that you already paid for plus the music videos. Buy this only if you want the music videos."
1,Greatest Hits? Ha.,"The songs on this album are FAR from ""Greatest Hits"" of Radio Disney. Many of the artists are sitll amatures. Radio Disney has been playing quality childrens music for years now. The inclusion of Stevie Brock is a mystery to me. Radio Disney, you HAVE had better.Myra's ""Miracles Happen"" and ""Dancing in the Streets"" have been some of the biggest and most requested on Radio Disney. Krystals ""Supergirl"", Britney Spears' ""Oops I Did it Again"", just about anything from the Spice Girls, NSYNC, Backstreet Boys - have all been left out.While I DO agree that Hilary, Jump 5, and some others should have been included - Disney has put the most ridiculous song choices on their ultimate ""Greatest Hits"" album.Pass on this one.. and purchase Disney's ""Mega Movie Mix"" album that has just been released."
2,Incorrect information,"On page 159 of the 3rd edition, it is mentioned that an individual is authorized to work with the receipt notice (for work authorization) and an SSN while waiting for the temporary employment authorization document. That is simply not true according to several Houston based immigration attorneys. I contacted the author of this book to get some clarifications but never got a response.After I recieved my notice of receipt, I got additional confirmation of that because it explicitly states that it cannot be used as an authorization to get any sort of legal employment."
1,This is Out of Date Material--from 2006,"That's all. It's out of date, from 2006. Some of the filing fees are now 3 times as much as this book says they are.And that's a long, long time when you're talking about immigration. The citizenship test itself was redesigned the end of 2008."
1,Still a useful book,"Even after 71 years, this grammar remains to be very useful. Though many things are ready to be revised, it still is the most elaborated grammar of New Testament Greek. The book provides a large amount of information and examples, referring as well to other major works, such as Blass, Moulton, ...I would not recommend this grammar to a student who starts learning New Testament Greek, since he will feel himself lost within the abiundance of material, but for the more experienced scholar, it still is a valuable tool."
5,epic game,this is one of the best selling epic games on the snes console. Great story and characters and even 15+ years down the line I still like it as much as i did when i was a kid. if you have an snes and dont have this game i have no clue what your doing.
5,(Second) Best SNES game ever.,"The mana series is one of square's best for the super nintendo. SOM has some of the best, if not the best graphics for SNES, the gameplay is very easy to pick up and go, yet very detailed and interesting. The spells are some of the most memorable of any game with the very cool eight elemental spirits. The story is a basic government trying to take over the world that has been done about one million times by now, but back then the story was fresh. The game is so breathtaking that you will want to play this through several times and the whole multiplayer add tons of replayability. The only game better than this for SNES, or ever is the released only in Japan sequel, Secret of Mana 2, or as it is really known, Seiken Densetsu 3."
5,The Greatest Game of all Time,"my life was predictable dull until by some marvelous chance the most brilliant game of all time. an rpg but with three characters filled with emotion and superb music..this game must have been the inspiration for todays huge rpgs.....as an rpg with multiplayer option it was perhaps the beginnings of the desire from millions to play rpgs online....if you have a snes or an emulator this is the best game ever..if i didnt already have it i would be downloading it right now..please if you like rpgs or just great stories, buy this game it will change the way you look at rpgs...it will make you believe in games again..what ever happened to the great gameplay of rpgs...this was the best example of japanese brilliance in the early rpgs...thank you square"
3,"I like this one, but ...","This is good, but I found the new novel, ""Home, Miss Moses,"" more inspiring and thought provoking, because it's just extraordinary and does better than ""A woman called Moses"" at portraying the likely complexity and deep spirituality of this great American hero. Check out ""Home, Miss Moses."""
2,Not enough info. on injury claims.,"Mr. Smith gives good information on how to negotiate for the best car claim, but he is very misleading on how to settle a personal injury claim. He also is very biased for the insurance industry and only tries to steer you toward a small claim. If you want to know about a personal injury claim, this book in't for you."
1,Misleading Title and Nothing New Under the Sun,"The publicity blurb made me think this book would help with a homeowner claim. There was nothing in the book but discussion about car accident claims. It was a complete waste of my money and time. The author rambled and repeated himself a lot. If he had been more concise and organized the book could have been written in 20 pages instead of 170. I am sorely disappointed, and would have been even if I had been looking for info on car accident claims."
2,Claims How To Collect Insurance Money Without A Lawyer,"Good if you need a ""cheerleader"". There are no forms or checklists to help you with your task so you are still on your own. Wording the claim letter is the big task and this book provides no help."
5,Money In My Pocket,"Thanks to the useful information in Gordon Smith's book, I made $1500.00 on an auto insurance claim. It's easy to understand every subject in this book. I'm a satisfied customer. THANK YOU!"
5,I'll read parts over and over,"As a first-time mom with a 13 month old, I've read lots of books about child rearing. But this one is my absolute favorite. After I finished reading it, I went back and started reading parts again. When I get frustrated, or unsure of myself, I will read some again, and it validates my feelings and makes me feel better! Sure, there are parts that don't really apply to me, or that I don't necessarily agree with, but 95% of this book worked for me. I found this to be the most HONEST of books of its type...brutally honest in parts. I highly recommend this book to any mother who occasionally feels frustrated, unsure, wacko, emotional, scatterbrains, or has ever said ""what the heck am I doing?"" I think my child, my husband, and I are all happier as a result of this book."
4,"""You ARE the weakest link...""","This vanilla release concludes the final three episodes of the New Series of Doctor Who. Boom Town is not a fan favorite, but it does have some funny moments. While Bad Wolf and the Parting of the Ways ties the season together, starting by putting the Doctor, Rose and Capt Jack Harkness in Reality Programs in the future. The New Series looks and sounds great. Christopher eccleston makes a great Doctor, and Billie Piper is a surprisingly great fit for his Doc. 'tis a shame Eccly only wanted to do one season."
2,Too short. Not historically accurate.,"While it was interesting to hear about ancient African royalty (I bet most people don't know that Africa HAD a royalty!), this book I don't think was all that great. For one thing, it was too short. Only about 80 pages, and it ended abruptly. Another thing: it wasn't all that historically accurate. Many of the characters were fictional. And it says in the back that the events described in the diary -- Nzingha going to Luanda and using a servant for a chair -- happened when she was 40 years old, not 13. This is my least favorite of the Royal Diaries series because of those things."
3,"A little boring, but some interesting facts","This book was sort of disappointing to me. I love the Royal Diary series, and I guess I expected something a little better. It is the story of Nzingha, the oldest daughter of the Ngola (he's like a king person). Though older than her brother and sisters, she is second in line for the leadership position because she is female. Nzingha's brother Mbandi, though, is lazy and irresponsible, so the Ngola makes Nzingha promise that she won't allow Mbandi to weaken the system. With that promise, Nzingha also has new studies and responsibilities.Nzingha's ""diary"" was harder for me to connect with the setting and people, for some reason. Part of the problem may have been because of it length. Only 80 pages, it seemed to cut off abruptly at the end. It was interesting, though, to read about this princess that I've never heard of."
3,Sooooooo SHORT!!!!!,"i read this book a few days ago and i thought i would be good after reading the first few pages. But after reading for a while, after about 90 pages, the STORY ended and went to Epilouge. The Epilouge is just talk talk talk. Very boring, and the rest of the book is all like pictures.I might have made the book sound very bad but i would recommend it for people who want to read a liite short story. There are also some very funny lines in the book that made me laugh! haha"
4,REALLY good but REALLY short,This is a great book and I totally recomend it. In some parts of the book you just have to smile but.............. I mean it was SO short! I felt like I only read it for five minuetes and then it was over! Still read it!
3,Not bad but ...,"I was looking forward to reading this book but , like you heard the book was real short but it had a lot of action and events and a way to feel like what living in Angol , Africa was like ."
4,Interesting,"I love reading about the African culture and I really enjoyed the story. However, I had two problems with it. Firstly, it was way to short. Secondly, many of the events that take place in the journal didn't happen until much later in her life, if they even happened at all.I suppose it was necessary to make it more interesting to read, but it made the book less accurate than any of the others.Even so, I think this book is very, very good and would definitely suggest it."
2,"Good historical details, weak story.","I had high hopes for this book, since I love The Royal Diaries series. I am sorry to say I was dissapointed. I never managed to get a feel for the characters, as they were never fully developed, remaining one-dimensional throughout the story. The line between good and evil was just too generally defined - Africans good, white people bad. Real life doesn't work that way. And when I completed the story, I felt like something was missing, that I hadn't read the whole book - it cut off so abruptly, at 86 pages, and the historical note and pictures seemed there just to make it look longer. I can't believe that such a short, unsubstational book is going to be $10.95. I expected better from this previously high-quality series."
2,"Good Setting, But No Plot","I'm an 11-year-old boy who read this book for schoolwork.I was pretty disapointed with this book. I mean, the title says WARRIOR queen but there's no fighting. All they do is talk about her father going to distant wars against the Portugese far away. She just talks and hunts. The setting was good, but there's really no plot.I think that girls, especially tomboys, would like it more than me because I'm a boy. However, I read the ""Mary Queen of Scots"" book (from the same series) and did like that one.I don't think that this book was worth reading. I can think of a whole host of books I would rather read. I think that if you're a boy, read something else."
3,I just got into it and it ended!,"I believe if this book would've went on a few hundred more pages it would've been much better. Even so it was a fairly good book. Being royal doesn't neccessarily mean being a princess in a palace. This book is a true example of this. Angolian history is a different kind of history to get what i mean read the book it's good, but dont get angry when it ends."
2,Nzingha:Warrior Queen of the book failiures,"Nzingha: Warrior Queen of MatambaSound interesting? It will at first glance. Now lets take a look inside. You read the first few pages and you will most likely decide to put the book down and never look at it again. The book is short, but the characters are boring, they have no personality at all. Really, they should have put some more OOMPH!! into the book to make it more interesting. You wondered why Nzingha got such a lowere reanking than the other Royal Diaries books. Well now you know why. If you want to read it, check it out from some library or borrow it. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money."
2,Nzingha,"I have now read all of the Royal Diary series, and love them, except this one. It was so short, and I thought it was kind of boring. The most interesting thing was when she used a servant as a chair. I didn't even bother reading the epilouge and the section of history in the back of this book. I think that first of all, it couldn;t have been a very good story because it didn;t have a great plot in the first place."
2,"Dont' except much, readers!","Ok, this book wasn't great, as u can see by my stars. I think that u should listen to me about this because i have read every single dear america book and royal diaries books and a ton more. So, now heres the point: this book is short and boring. the only reason i bought it was because i have a collection and i wanted it to be complete. Patricia McKissak: i really liked ure other books, but this one was SAD! write better ones like the Dear America books u wrote!"
1,good try,"OK, NZINGA WAS NOT THE BEST , NUBER1 , OR AWESOME. I WAS DISAPPOINTED. BUT IT'S WORTH A SHOT."
1,Nzingha: Warrior Queen of Matamba,"If you want to read this book, I strongly suggest you get it out from a local library because this is one book that I believe was a complete waste of time. At first glance, it looks interesting; don't be fooled, its not."
3,Not the Best,I have read many Dear America books and this is my least favorite so far I have to admit. I mean you are suppose to learn about Angola and all that but since this book was so short I don't really know that much about the whole plot yet. I mean it was really too short for you to understand the plot. Just not one of the best books I have ever read.
2,Dull and Short..............................................,"What can I say?This is the WORST royal diaries book I have ever read!!!!!The Problem is that it is DULL!!!!!Nothing happens-the most exiciting thing is when she's kippnapped by her loyal servant,and even thats DULL because it was all a show for some evil guy........And another big problem was it was to short!!!Gosh,I paid [item price] for it and it was only 138 pages!!!!!If I were You, I would definatly NOT waste my money on this-Buy a different Royal diary book,Most are a LOT better............."
3,Warrior Princess,Nzingha is the eldest daughter of Ngola Mdambi Kiluanji second wife Kangela. She longs to rule and understands her people but no woman has ever ruled her tribe before and her bratty brother who cares nothing for the people is to inherit the throne.She is sent to the Portugese city to try to find some way to stop them from taking her people as slaves. She herself is nearly captured.The book was really to short to develope the charecters well.It wasn't great. If you are new to the series do not read this one first.
2,Too short!,"""Nzingha: Warrior Queen of Matamba"" was an OK book, but is definitly not worth buying. It ended too abrubtly and at times was kind of confusing. The historical events in the book were all mixed up, and many of the characters are fictional. This book doesn't compare to the other Royal Diaries books."
3,durango's review,"Nzingha is an interesting book but some parts are kind of boring.I like it though, I had to do it for a report for my school. I did not like the book at first but then I started to like it.like I said before it is kind of boring. It is a historical fiction book. If you like historical fiction books this would be a good book for you"
2,so-so,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but it turned out not to be as great as I thought. The plot wasn't one of the best i have read, and frankly, wasn't that interesting. You could figure out the whole story from the first 5-10 pages. Also, it isn't that long at all- only 86 pages. Most Dear Americas are at least 100. Go ahead and buy the book, but don't expect a great story."
4,"Nzingha, Warrior Queen of Matamba : Angola",This story is about an African Princess. She will stand up for her village and prevail. As a history lover i found this tale of heroism interesting and rewarding.
5,gift,My husband read all of these as a child and loved them. He sent this to our grandson in Colorado that really likes to read.
5,Very good loose tea,I ordered several types of loose brown rice tea. This one had the best taste. I have found by trial and error that it is important to only seep for 5 minutes max so it does not taste bitter. I am ordering more.
2,Weak Tea,This blend makes a very weak tea. I tried it because it was less expensive than the Numi brand Genmaicha. You get what you pay for here. It has none of the depth or flavor that Numi has. I would not recommend this tea.
4,Good,It was good. I just wish there werent highlighted phrases all over the book. Its very good other than tht
5,Super music,I will continue to buy more from him. Love it and my friend uses it for spiritual workshops. Great music!
2,Over rated,This book is not as portrayed in the description or with the other customer reviews. It is clealy overpriced for its content and quality. Don't buy this book.
3,Good game,"Got it for the kids, didn't play it myself but it kept them busy over the break. Sent it back to college with one of them to share with the roommates"
5,They taste great!,"These are the best gluten-free crackers I have tried. They have an almost sweet, graham cracker taste. I use peanut butter on them and take them in my lunch. They are the only gluten-free crackers that I have found that I like!"
4,Nice Tripod,"I bought this as a more portable alternative to the Davis Sanford Fm18 (which is one of the best tripods I have ever owned). The 2800 is very sturdy, pans and tilts smoothly, overall it is a great portable tripod. I use it with a canon 7d with battery grip, a flash and some pretty heavy lenses, as well as a canon Xh a1. My only reason for giving this tripod 4 stars is the fact that the knobs are made of fairly cheap plastic. Which will make you fearful that they will break (even know I don't think they will) plastic just does not inspire confidence. With that said the 2800 is a great portable tripod. If you are looking for a heavier duty tripod the Davis Sanford Fm18 is nearly perfect."
2,beware,This is a cheap knock-off of an older set that I had.Quality is not good and the crock was broken when received.
3,Ok,"This set is okay. The container has a very narrow opening, so nothing else will fit in it. Some of the pieces are of questionable quality."
2,Disappointed.,"Not what I had expected to hear. If you are looking for some of the more uplifting, earth melodies heard in Cyne other albums - beware! This album is way too ""explicit"" for my hip-hop ears."
2,"good fit,easy install as long as they send the right one","after cracking 2 windshields in previous vehicles due to flying gravel on the highway, I decided to buy a bug/rock shield. I wasn't sure how it would look on a civic, but it turned out great. Nice custom look,especially with matching vent guards on moonroof and side windows,all smoke gray. The company called to ensure I had ordered correct size for my car before shipping,nice customer service. Very easy to install, screws into pre-existing holes under hood.Part 2- I should have stopped while I was ahead, but ordered a 2nd one for a 4 door civic. They sent me the same one as for the 2 door,which does not fit. Unable to contact vendor to return."
4,"Works as designed for 12"" G4 Powerbook","My 12"" G4 Powerbook fits inside snugly; perfectly. There is a handy utility pocket that zips up & holds a few incidentals - cables, battery etc. This was priced a bit high but it fits and performs as advertised."
1,An iBook G4 does not fit in this bag,"Regardless of what the vendor says, you absolutely cannot zip this bag shut with the G4 iBook in it. I got a refund, but still ate shipping both ways."
4,FUN BUT HARD,"This was one of the first SNES games I ever owned but it took me 15 years to beat this one. Not that I was trying continuously but I could never beat it growing up! The game only features 6 stages but it gets hard right from the start and only gets more difficult as you progress. Each stage features 3 levels and then a boss fight I guess you could call it. Wile E. Coyote is using some new invention of his in every level but he builds something big you have to dismantle during the boss fight. The level design for this game is very good and there are all kinds of checkpoints in each level in case you die the chances of which are very high. This game is incredibly difficult and equally satisfying. There's nothing quite like knowing you triumphed over impossible odds at a game most players have given up on. I recommend you try this game out, but don't expect it to go easy on you. It's going to take everything you got and then some to beat Wile E. Coyote!"
5,This book was really good and I enjoyed it.,"During a long winter, one after another of ten young girls began having visions seeing the Devil and thrashing about in wild outbursts and conclusions. After a cursory investigation, the town elders quickly concluded that these poor possed children were under a dreaded evil influence..... Witches The narrator of this often frightening tale, based on historical facts. Mary Warren, a bound girl and one of the ten possed. In her vivid account, she tells of the semindly uncontrollable sequence of events, of which she was part, leading to the now-infamous Salem with-hunt and trials of 1692 andof how fear and imagination run wild brout an elding no one ever expected."
5,Great for my coupon binder,"I really like these tabs. Easy to use and move around if you need to. They don't smear and have plenty of space to write on. Work great for my coupon binder, I'm not an extreme couponer by any means, but I use a small binder to organize with and they are the perfect tab for this! I would definitely recommend this!"
4,A time saver and very handy when you teach,These tabs are really great and save a lot of time when you are preparing a lesson plan. The idea is to use them to indicate where the chapters start so that you can easily flip to the right page and not waste a bunch of effort paging through the book. We only use one chapter at a time and these tabs are just the thing to make it easier.
5,LIne up and get your Ticket,"Flight of Fantasy is one flight you will want to take. Riveted from the opening pages, I fell in love with Elly Winter and her offbeat personality. Be prepared for smiles and chuckles as she interacts with the utterly confused and drop-dead handsome hero, Slade Calvert. Together they struggle to survive in the jungle of some Central American country, not to mention trying to avoid a local coup. Take my advice. Buy this dazzling display of storytelling -- and take this Flight of Fantasy."
3,"Useful "" small"" book","Essential anatomy is a book which is recommend for most of the clinical year students who had forgotten some of the anatomy, especially those clinically useful. This book contain quite a number of radiological photos that is quite helpful for quick reference. Well, i can say this book is not useful for those who study anatomy well in their preclinical year, since it is just a quick reference without any good atlas. All the atlas are just Black and white drawings."
1,"a year and a half later, it's broken",It's broken after very little use... the Yamaha support said we're better off buying a new one... very disappointing!
1,seems like a good concept but a waste of time,"Olmert's choppy writing style and tangents make this book completely undesirable. The text always seems to stray away from what the reader would expect and WANT. For instance, being a major baseball fan, I went straight to that section upon opening the book. However, all that is there is an explanation of the term ""texas leaguer"" (not something even die-hard baseball fans really care about - I mean c'mon, don't be TOO specific)."
3,Some diamonds during the decline,"It's always sad to witness the decline of a once-great talent, and unfortunately, this first-ever collection of Clyde's mid-'60s singles for Amy Records makes us do just that. Still, even as he was going downhill, Clyde could still manage a few golden moments. His third (?) Amy single, ""Everybody Loves A Good Time"" b/w ""Little Bit of Sunshine,"" should've been a big 2-sided hit. And you've never heard ""Everybody's Somebody's Fool"" done THIS way before - as a gospel sermon, complete with choir! These tracks alone make this CD worth your while."
5,One of the best sport shoes,I had a pair of this sport shoes for about 6 years. All I can say is this is probably one of the best shoes I have ever had. Very comfortable and light. Can wear whole day and never get tired.
3,My kids never liked this as much as they did Volume 1 -- an all-time favorite.,"""Moondreams,"" as my kids call it, is an all-time favorite bed-time CD at our house. I got Volume 2 to mix things up a bit, but it's never been as popular. They actually asked me to get rid of it. They seem to prefer female singers. I think most small children do. Volume 1 is really good. Catchy tunes. Nothing too terribly annoying, which is always a plus for the parents."
4,kinda strange,"I decided to purchase this movie from Amazon.com for two reasons: (1) I started watching it on This-tv and never finished watching because it was late at night and I fell asleep.(2) I saw this movie in a store and it was one of a six movie package showcasing Cher's talent, and the price was high and I knew out of the six movies I would only watch two. So I purchased this movie so I could continue watching the movie. It was a pretty good movie, but I was left scratching my head at the end. I like B- movies and this is a B-movie, so if you like Cher you might like this movie, and if you are a B-movie fan like myself. Also if you like movies from the end of the 1960's you may like this."
2,"Weird, bad but so bad, it's good","Cher, in 1969, looks very 2009 here, only the 60s vintage cars and the lame styles on everyone else in this film give it away as an exploitation vehicle from the flower power era. Cher has one expression here: blank. She is very unhappy about something, her family, I guess. She's a runaway, but with street smarts, or so she thinks. There's a soundtrack here, but it's very unobtrusive, which is too bad because some more Cher tunes is just what this vintage howler needs to bring it alive."
1,Watch out this stuff is BITTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After reading a number of reports regarding the benefit of Triphala I decided to give it a try. This is not the pills, this is the powder in which you mix a teaspoon of this in hot water and sip it like a tea. This is the most bitter tasting cr*p I have ever had. I don't care what benefits this is supposed to offer, it is far too disgusting to take in this form. The capsules are the way to go if you want to use this product!"
4,Works with Paint Shop Pro,"I just got this book; the previous reviewers' guidance was a big help on the CD serial number, and the tones plugin is pretty nice (although the tones included with this book tend to be very basic; now I want to buy the other Computones volumes hoping for more special effect tones).I was taking a bit of a chance when I bought this. I wasn't *totally* sure I could use the plugin because the image was too small to read the fine print in the compatible software box on the cover, so here's what it says: ""Compatible Plug-in Modules for Adobe Photoshop 4.0~7.0, Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0, Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7.0~8.0"". The gamble paid off for me since I'm a PSP 8 user, but I wanted to post that info in a review so others wouldn't have to gamble. ^_~"
2,How to get the CD-Rom serial # to work,"The book looks great and the instructions are very informative. I was really looking forward to using this book until I tried installing the Computones Plug-In for Photoshop CS.The Computones/Photoshop Plug-In did successfully install but the Serial # located in the front of the book does not unlock the Computones Filter. This makes the lessons in the book completely useless until it is fixed by either Graphic-Sha or CelSys Inc.Fortunately, I was able to contact Graphic-Sha, the publisher, and they said they have the correct Serial # at:www dot graphicsha dot co dot jp/Info/index_compu dot html"
2,great idea if the disk worked,"I am an artist. I LOVE experimenting with digital art. So when I saw this book in a store I had to have it. I bought it, read it, and was excited when I finaly installed it..... only to find out it did not work. I have tried exchanges with the store, alternet ways of installing the program, putting in the serial number in a million different ways, and have installed and uninstalled the program at least a millon times over the past few weeks.I do not no if it is the fact I am using Elements 3.0 or if it is a screw-up on the manufatures part, but i would advise getting this book only after someone post a review about it atually working. the book is about how to use the disk and without the disk it is crap."
3,Not for Mac users!,"This may be a great product, but don't by hasty like I was--take a moment to enlarge the cover image and you'll see that it's intended for Windows users only. The plug-ins are for Windows applications, and the individual tone files are also in a Windows format. Bummer. (Still, the book is a nice guide to applying tone to cartoon illustrations.)"
4,Quite a nice book~,"I think this is quite a good book for beginners who want to learn manga rendering. It teaches some of the basic light and shadow, and tone shading. I find it quite detailed and useful."
4,Exiting Young European Choir,The Nordic Chamber Choir is a very exiting young European ensemble with a great future. Their latest recording with works by Morten Lauridsen et al. is pure delight and a wellcome recommendation of Lauridson's opus in Europe. I heared the CD and the choir live in concert and was impressed.
2,No sir i dont mind about it.,I tride this lots of times already. I dont really mind about even though they are my favorite cartoons. When you get into stimpys mouth his teath start to go down. You'd be better off getting Stimpys invention for your sega genesis.
3,This scenario is easy to follow and is targeted at toning.,"This video is serene. It is well-organized, and the models appear as everyday sorts of people. A modified view of the demonstration is given for the more limited viewer. It is stressed throughout that one should feel the stretches, but not experience pain. It is presented in segments(3), and suggests that individuals pace themselves. The routine fits neatly into the limited time-frame that I devote to exercise, 32 min."
3,Thrustmaster Force Feedback Racing Wheel,"This is a good wheel, the force effects are strong and it feels stable. I use this wheel on my primary system, but use the logitech wheel on my secondary system. The logitech is 2/3 the price and feels just as ggod maybe even a little more comfortable than the Thrustmaster."
1,Broken on arrival,"I E-Mailed Thrustmaster directly after Christmas. The pedal plate was broken when the box was open. The plastic studs are broken out. I want the the broken piece replaced. I would like to have just a replacement part shipped since the wheel is working just fine, however the metal plate is not attached. If this part is taken care of I would be happy to write a great review, but I need a response to my E-Mail.Please adviseDoug Solt"
2,For Historical Value Only,"Buyer beware. Early editions of Perry Cox's price guides are poor quality, one step up from fanzine style (albeit on coated stock) and are useful only as memorabilia in their own right. The price says it all. I am a purchaser of the 3rd edition, and while I was aware that the prices wouldn't reflect current values (obviously) I was shocked at the poor quality of the reproductions of the Beatles' albums, etc. Like I said, if you're buying this for historical purposes, fine, but go with the newer editions for anything else. The Spizer books are the best in terms of graphic quality, but they are for ID uses only. They're also a bit pricier but worth it in the long run."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this item as a little present for a coworker. It never grew! After 5 week i digged it out and it was rotten. I know for fact that i did not overwater it, i had grown those beens before. Will never buy again."
2,Not hidden message,"The seed comes out of the box, so the person can see the message before it grows, so it looses its charm."
1,Disappointed,"I got this for my boyfriend's birthday along with other things and we were pretty excited to plant it and see it grow. I watered it, put it near sunlight, and waited... and waited... and waited... about two weeks later I was starting to wonder if it'll ever grow so I pulled the bean out to check what was going on. It was black so I took that as it died. I don't blame the company cause it was very cold and it probably died along the way or something. I was really disappointed though, since it was a present for someone."
4,Butcher Baker,Great read. I personaly knew Bob Hansen. He was my next door neighbor for a number of years. The book seems to be a very accurate protrayal of what really did happen in the case.
2,Interpretation?,"Conner tries to base some symbolism on related scriptures, but I don't think he does a good enough job of that. He doesn't understand the basic allegory in scripture IMO."
2,Expected More,"I bought this book hoping to reinforce and elaborate on what I have learned about triple souls, aligning them, and certainly hoping to learn more about kala. It is more of book of memoirs than a learning tool and I was sadly disappointed. I mean no disrespect to this book or the Andersons; I have much respect for them and wished I had the chance to have met them before they had passed. How lucky for their students to have learned under them. They certainly are wonderful people."
1,dissapointing,"Much as I hate to say anything bad about another Pagan author, esp one who is enshrined in such fame as this one, I was expecting great things from this book...And didn't find them. Having the utmost respect for Starhawk and her teachings, I thought reading a book written by her mentor would teach me even more....I don't know if it is because some people just don't have the gift of the written word....maybe Victor was better in person...but i found nothing useful in this book, and very little even hinting at real Faery lore.It was rambling, pretentious and full of hints about Hawaiian shamanic practices and a lot of focus on the joys of astral sex.All in all, it's an interesting addition to my library of pagan tradition and history, but not a useful workbook."
2,They sound like every other band that's out there.,They're tight but definitely NOT ORIGINAL! To compare them to the Dave Matthews Band is absurd!
2,U2 meets Abercrombie and Fitch....,"If you think my description of the album sounds appealing, you are what's wrong with Christian music these days. It's sad to see good, original bands like Audio A giving in to [junk] like mainstream trends. Until now, they have always been their own entity. Much like a washed out DC Talk (including Mike, Kevin, AND Toby) AA has given in to popular demand and lost almost everything that made them an excellent band with a phenomenal ministry.But hey, if you're one of those trendy wave riders that liked the last AA album, you'll probably LOVE this one too..."
3,What happened?,"I've been an Audio A fan ever since Bloom which was a great CD. I bought Some Kind of Zombie. Bought Underdog. Even saw them in concert 3 times (twice as a backup, once as a headliner).I've always been a big Audio A fan. I hadnt heard much about this new CD LIFT and was suprised to find it in my stocking on Christmas morning.When i popped it into my CD player, I immediately heard some awesome Audio A sounds on songs like ""You Still Amaze Me"", ""I'm Alive""(my fave). I was impressed and looked forward to listening to the rest of the CD, but once i got past the 5th song, things REALLY slowed down. This was not the Audio A. I had come to love. I dunno what happened. Maybe they think they need to be more ""mature"". I wish they had stuck w/ the same sound that made them a great band.There are some really great songs on this CD and i dont want it to sound like i hate this CD but it was a bit of a disapointment.ROCK ON AUDIO A!!!!!!!!"
3,"Audio Adrenaline, wherefore art thou?","I bought this album with high expectations, but am really disappointed. I consider this to be their weakest album since Don't Censor Me. It sounds tired and unoriginal. It kind of reminds me of Cake's latest two outings (Comfort Eagle and Prolonging the Magic), there are decent songs, but they sound like older AA songs. Mark's voice sounds especially worn throughout the album. Most of the songs sound like AA is trying to be Third Day or The Newsboys, which is a shame because I always considered them to be much better and inovative. The lyrics have devolved into very tired Christian cliches that were getting old in the 80s. IMHO, Audio Adrenaline peaked at Some Kind of Zombie, and never quite reached that plateau again. Darn shame."
5,Some songs are better than others,"This is overall an awesome album. ""Summertime"" has got the most GORGEOUS beat I've ever heard in my life!!!!!! I melt every time I hear it and savor every beautiful metric!!!!!!! It really puts the mushy ""Beautiful"" to shame! I mean, I like the words to ""Beautiful"", but it has NO beat whatsoever compared to ""Summertime""!!!! Long live fast beats and may that medium-paced, early '70s beat DIE!"
3,Obsessing Orlando,"Orlando Bloom is the main focus of Jenna's life, so when her mother strips her room of all her Orli miscellania, relegating it to a closet, Jenna's world begins a downward spiral that only speeds up as the days pass. When she sneaks into his latest R rated movie and her parents find out, her obession is violently confronted, in her opinion, as she has to trash every bit of Orlando she owns. To make matters worse, she continually seems to embarrass herself in front of the cute new guy in town. However, Will seems not to mind, and in fact, might look a bit like a young Orlando. Maybe, real life has something dreams can't offer?*** This slice of life novel is one that rings with truth. The humor is right on target. Though Jenna's observations on the human condition are tinged with massive amounts of hyperbole, she is a typical teen girl, a heroine that the average reader will relate to.Amanda Killgore"
4,"Very useful for modern parenting, for fathers and mothers.","Ehrensaft describes sympathetically the guilt pitfalls facing parents in the modern two-earner family. Trying to balance work and family is confusing and often makes us anxious and harried fathers and mothers. As a result, she argues, we can easily over-pamper our children, over-invest in presents and ironically rush our children too quickly through their childhood. In clear and helpful prose and with many concrete examples, drawn from years of clinical experience and teaching as well as from modern psychological research, Ehrensaft offers parents insightful advice on how to be more relaxed and better parents to our children. Few things in life are more important. Well-balanced in lessons for fathers as well as mothers, this is a must read for current and prospective parents."
1,Dangerous territory without much back-up.,"She takes some big unsubstantiated leaps about a pretty serious topic, parental aggression, in this book. Can she be serious that there is a link between a societal ban on hitting kids and the rise in child abuse? I think we need to see some hard research on that. If that's not bad enough, she also wonders whether there is something to be learned from her own mother, who freely called out to bisbehaving kids, ""I'll kill you!"" Although her concern for the inhibited parent may be justified, she doesn't seem to know when to draw the line on parental aggression nor give the reader a sense of appropriate ways to express anger. Thanks anyway, I'll pass on this one."
4,A useful book,"Haddon's book contains a lot of useful information for those of us who are no longer in our teens, and points out some beauty mistakes we make as we age (such as putting our blusher on wrong or choosing the same colors we did in our 20's). This is one of the few books that addresses how to adjust your look as you age. She also gives good advice on health and exercise aimed at more mature bodies. Know going in that Haddon is beautiful, rich, and a spokeswoman for L'Oreal. Her photos are airbrushed so you don't see a single line in her face. Also, we don't all have the financial resources that Haddon has, so you have to adapt much of her advice to fit your budget. I also own the Beauty Bible, which is a better all-around book, but Haddon's book is more tailored to the needs of the over 40 crowd. It's a rich, lovely book with some gorgeous photos."
2,A very pretty advertisement for a couple of cosmetic firms..,"After seeing Dayle on Ophrah, I rushed to buy her book, thinking that she would have some new perspective on this thing called aging. The book itself is very visually attactive. It is however a chore to read. Long drawn out sections and paragraphs have little substance...but plenty of fluff. Dayle is an impressive woman and a role model...especially in light of her personal struggles. I would have rather heard about how she drew her strength than what comes out in this book. Lucrative contracts with various cosmetic firms appear to have tainted her objectivity...I sure hope she receives a commission from all the women who will undoubtably go and buy what she is selling.Dayle...you've sold yourself short. It's like reading a romance novel from Maya Angelou."
1,Merely a Coffee Table Book,I bought this book in great expectation of obtaining some ideas and hints for beauty treatments for women over 40. I was wrong! It was merely a book showing off Ms. Haddon's over-40 photograph stills--airbrushed to say the least. It did not tell anything I did not know already on achieving it.It was...wasted money unless I use it as a coffee table book.
1,jolaire,"I did not like this book. After reading ""The Beauty Bible"" by sarah stacey and josephine fairley, I thought it was poorly written. Anyone looking for a really good informative beauty book should purchase ""The beauty bible"" instead."
1,pure silliness,"You know what--I hated this book. One more example of stars with zillions of dollars telling me how I can become ""ageless in my beauty"" without the zillions for facelifts, makeup, fashion, etc. It was pap--and patronizing and I'm sorry I spent the money."
5,Excellent Bible,I have searched many bibles and I can assure that NASB Update in Touch Ministries is an excellent BIBLE. The cover is soft and text is readable.
3,Interesting concept,"You start out the game by selecting one of six mercenaries contracted to go on 12 missions in four levels. Each level is more difficult than the other. This game had a very good concept, as you play a shooting game from an overhead view, (much like Ikari Warriors), in a hugely detailed level where you destroy monsters, soldiers, tanks and snakes. Along the way you collect cash from destroying these enemies, and collecting keys, enabling secrets and setting traps for the enemies to fall into. Then between the levels you purchase power-ups, like better and bigger weapons, more energy, and replenishing energy. This game is not for everyone, but I would recommend it for people wanting a unique difficult challenge."
4,Great,"If you like latin rhythms, a little bit of rock, ska, reggea buy this cd.They come from argentina, the first single ""Te quiero comer la boca"" (""I want to eat your mouth"") is powerfull song and a solo guitarr is the best part of the song, there are other good songs like the second single ""Todos tenemos un amor"" (""Everybody have a love""), the third ""Hoy estoy peor que ayer"" ("" I'm worse than yesterday"") and the last single "" Todo pasa"" (""everything happens"")"
2,oh dear!,"i have always been pleased with pat coil's interpretations of many of my favorite numbers. he is a consummate musician and whilst he doesn't quite re-interpret in the joe cocker+a little help from my friends style, he has never been boring. now he has achieved that with this lacklustre effort. they say when you taste a new wine that if you don't want a second glass, don't bother. sorry pat, i won't bother and next time i'll listen before i hand over any money."
1,Highwayman Live,"READ FINE PRINT BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT! I am a huge Highwayman fan and could not wait to get this DVD. Immediately upon receiving it I put it in the DVD player and saw ""cannot read"". I logged on to view my original order and realized I had ordered ""Region 2"", this means it will not play in the US!!! It definately was my fault for not noticing the Region 2 in the first place, but in my defense I was doing some quick shopping and did not even know you could buy something that would not play in the US. I would think the seller would notice that the product was being shipped to a US address and inform the buyer they are buying a product that most likely won't play on a DVD player sold in the US or Canada. I guess if I ever visit Japan or Europe I'll have something to listen to."
1,BEWARE: This is a Euro zone DVD... even though it says it's not. It won't play in normal USA devices...,"Beware: Although the description states that this is the correct USA zone formatting, it is not. It won't play in my DVD player."
5,Great video,"This is a great video. I wasn't familiar with the highwaymen before but since getting this video I've played it almost every day.The only bad thing about this video is that it won't play on my boyfriend's DVD player. The 2nd one they sent me (1st one was defective) plays on my old DVD player but his new Sony DVD player won't play it. Go figure! It was a gift for him. Oh well, at least I get to hear them play."
5,"The ""Dream Team"" of country music","Wow! This dvd is a real feast for every country music lover. To hear Johnny cash, willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings separately is a pleasure. So just imagine what happens on the stage when all these four legends combine forces (and voices)...Indeed the outcome of this reunion deserves every superlative. We all know about the Dream Team the U.S. sent to the Olympic games, and won the gold medal in basketball. Well, the Highwaymen is America`s Dream Team in country music.The concert took place in 1990, at Long Island`s Nassau Coliseum. But dont worry: the sound is 5.1 Dolby Digital, meaning: rich.This dvd has only one ""flaw"": it ends after about 90 minutes..."
4,highwaymen-live,"beware! this dvd from amazon advertised as ntsc format. dvd is pal format, as indicated on insert in jewel case."
2,Half the songs missing,Half of the songs listed on the frontspiece are not on the DVD. It is as if there is one DVD of a 2 set missing.When I go to select a particular song around 4 stanzas are played and then replayed instead of the actual song being played.Very disappointed.
2,Highwaymen Live,"This million dollar band with music legends won't play on a DVD machine. After 3 attempts of receiving the DVD from Amazon, it fails to play on DVD players, presumbably because it is in a PAL format. It will, however, play on a PC or laptop. This viewing is unsatisfactory unless you like hanging over a 12-17 inch screen. If anyone has a method for the DVD to play on a standard U.S. DVD player - I would like to know."
3,Big Highwayman Fan!,"I returned this dvd the first time and received another in exchange. It has a label on the wrapper ""Made in Germany"" and doesn't play on my regular DVD player. The replacement also only plays on my pc, but it's good enough for me since the content is great."
1,Same as everyone else - Won't play on any DVD player!,I didn't read the reviews before buying (love the artists so figured it would be a great show)and unfortuantely that was not a good move. I had the same problem as everyone else. The DVD I received will not play on any DVD player in my home (tried 3 of them). Very disappointed as this was a surprise gift for my hubby for Father's Day. He was so excited to watch it and I felt awful that it was worthless. Sending it back for a refund. Wish they had one that worked. :-)
1,Highwaymen Live,I order two of these for gifts and neither of the two would play!This is very embarrassing when they were given as gifts!
1,Does Not Work on DVD Players!,"Purchased as Christmas gift months ago, very disappointed to find out that my recipient could not view it. Tried two different DVD players. Useless, huge disappointment!"
5,"The Highwaymen-Willie, Waylon, Cash & Kris",It's an excellent view of past country stars and their rise to fame. It is one of the best tapes especially since the famous Johnny Cash is no longer with us. It's an excellent tribute to him.
3,Plays in my Xbox 360,"FYI - when I purchased this, there were two versions being offered on Amazon: one that lists the DVD as being region 2 and one that didn't. I ordered the one that wasnt labelled as being region 2 and hoped for the best. What came in the mail turned out to be a PAL region 2 DVD. It wouldn't play in my Blu Ray player, but it does play in my xbox 360, thankfully. Awesome concert! 5 stars if you can get it to play on your setup."
5,what i expected,"The product arrived in time and it was just what they said it was going to be: used with some highlighting, but excellent otherwise."
2,"""Internal Error - Saving Failed""","This unit worked well for a year, but we now get constant Internal Error; Saving Failed messages. I see by reading reviews, this is also a problem on the RS-TX 20 models. Rebooting works at times, but overall it's like the Hotel California: you can check in, but you can't check out sort of thing. Buyer beware (if this unit is even available anymore."
1,Just stopped working after a year,"We really enjoyed our TIVO until yesterday when the whole unit stopped working. It is out of warranty by a month and we will have to ship it out to have it fixed. God knows how much it will cost. We may get another unit, but definitely not another Toshiba."
1,No support available,"I loved the Toshiba RS-TX60, until it started to malfunction six months after I bought it. Support is essentially not available. TIVO phone support won't allow you to get past the start menu if you own a Toshiba product. Toshiba says that the issue is the TIVO software. This may, in fact, be true, since the problem is that the unit will not accept commands to navigate through the TIVO menus and will not burn programs saved in TIVO to DVD. However, a hefty TIVO fee is required to use the unit, and so clearly both of the companies should support the product.I would not buy any TIVO unit not made, and supported, by TIVO."
1,I have not received my order yet.,"I am hoping to get my book next week. That is what it said on the order. I live in RSA, so it obviously takes longer. I found it quite easy to buy it through Amazon, though. I hope I receive it this week as I need it for a course I am doing."
3,Teaching 12-steps to church groups,"I used the book to teach a 12 step Bible Study at church. The material is a good starting point for each step. After reading the text chapters, you will find many good and better Biblical illustrations for each step on your own, or other members of the group will. The questions for each chapter were good and generated useful discussions. I think the explanations of the steps from ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" are better. I'd suggest using this book together with ""Alcoholics Anonymous""."
4,"Given the price, it is a good buy!","I purchased this unit about 3 weeks ago. The main reason for purchasing it was that I wanted a rotisserie with temperature control (most small ones available have only a timer). I used it with a couple of Cornish Hens the other day and they turned out just fine.The fan is a bit noisy, but that is to be expected in an appliance of this price range.It is a very versatile appliance that does pretty much what it is supposed to, but I wish I could find some accessories (like real cookie sheets, an additional rack, etc.) somewhere."
1,no good,i recieved this oven and use it about 5 times and it just stopped working in the middle of baking...i would not take a replacement....
4,GREAT APPLIANCE. HUGE COOKING CAVITY.,WE PURCHASED OUR UNIT IN NOVENBER OF 2005 AND HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE UNIT. WE USE IT SEVERAL TIMES EVERY DAY TO KEEP FROM CRANKING UP THE STOVE.THE ROTISSERE WORKS AS ADVERTISED AND THE OVEN CAPACITY IS LARGER THAN ANY OTHER WE HAVE HAD. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE UNIT AND WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT WHEN THIS ONE DIES.
1,just died,"Bought this 6 months ago, worked great, no problems in what we wanted to use it for. Then out of now where the unit just quit working. Tried to get it fixed found out that the unit was already a refurbished unit."
4,Good machine for what I needed,"I bought this model in early 2005 because I am often just cooking for one. I did not want to clutter the counter with a toaster and a toaster oven, nor heat up my large range oven, so I opted for this one. It has performed well. I found as did others that it cooked faster in the back than the front, so I have had to rotate food. I have used Bake, Broil and Toast frequently with minor issues. Dec 2007 the temperature knob broke off. I am trying to find another since I like my unit (Euro-Pro.com model finder cannot seem to find my model number)."
5,"MY FAVORITE ""SHORT"" PRACTICE","At about 25 minutes this my favorite tape for days I'm pressed for time or also want to the treadmill. This tapes packs alot in a short time. After a few sun salutes, you move to loosening those hips. I store alot of tension there, from walking, sitting. You name it. These poses really stretches you out. Then you do a few ""core"" poses and finally a twist and corpse pose. I do this tape 2-3x's a week. I never get bored with it and always sweat! This would be a great addition to your library."
2,Save your money,"The kit was pretty worthless overall. Save your money, buy ""Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution"" 2002 version, and join some online low carb lists. You'll be better off."
1,in complete,all that was sent was the carb counting little book.. thats not what is was supposed to be.. i used to have this and i know. this is only the little carb book that came with all the other stuff.. what a joke . not funny
1,you really need some carbs...,"This is the unrevised version of Atkins, and it is still too heavy on protein to be a safe sustainable diet. Interesting to have on the bookshelf, but I found it unusable. Has lots of recipe cards and a fold out carb counter and a little book and suggestions for daily food plans based on certain carb levels.As a nurse, I say, unsustainable, way too high in fat and protein, seen plenty of people sick and on the verge of collapse from not eating as the book suggests and chowing down on steak and eggs and sausages and more eggs and wondering why they get dizzy and palpitations and they lose 5kg of water and go off the diet within two weeks and gain 6kg.Try the Zone. It may look complicated, but the key to modern day fat loss is insulin regulation (insulin is a fat storage hormone and it blocks fat releasing hormones), and high protein diets mess with your insulin levels as well as high sugar diets do."
5,Best Reference Book on Composition Dolls!,"This is the BEST book I have ever seen on Composition Dolls! Not only does it include marked dolls, but identifies unmarked dolls based on their characteristics. Also has many dolls that the Blue Book does not have. Great color photographs! The only thing that this book does not have is an index of marks (initials & numbers) for quick reference. I love this book!"
3,Carefully researched and judicial,"Anything by any of these authors is always informative and well-researched. The only caveat I have about this book is that, published in 1989, it seems to be a trifle too defensive against conservative US Christians who identify very strongly with the US message of constitutional liberty. Conservative American Christians can sometimes be excessive, but most of them are not chauvinistic zealots."
3,Charlie Company perspective,"As a member of Charlie Company, it is my opinion that the author was overly critical of Charlie Company. And I did notice one major discrepancy with the participants and their roles in one specific event. However, having said that, it was also a refreshing reminder of names and places I thought I would never forget, but had. I also think it's encouraging to see an NCO take the initiative of publishing something like this, and am curious as to how this reflects on his current enlistment. I really give the book a 4 but felt obligated to defend Charlie."
4,Good Book,"Been to combat or not. Unless you belong to an LAI unit, I'd say this book is very insightful. This gives you a great inside perspective of the inner workings of LAI units. One that I for one did not previously have. I enjoyed reading this book and getting to understand another piece of the big puzzle. It almost seems that not a whole lot in the Marine Corps has changed since the Kuwait liberation. In 2003 my Jarheads and I went through some of the same problems, emotions, and obsticles from our 2 months of training in Kuwait to breaching the Iraqi border and the dark side to Baghdad."
4,good Christian metal-core,"This album is pretty amazing-- Christian metal-core played with a surprising amount of talent and complexity. Jazz influences appear frequently. There's something strange about the production which makes the music sound a little flat, though. The general tone doesn't vary all that much. A brighter sound would bring out the complexity in the music more. And the lyrics have to go-- I don't mind Christian lyrics, as long as they're intelligent, but these are a little too predictable and preachy. It's easy to ignore these short-comings when you're listening to the music, though, which is very original, and unlike anything else I've heard."
3,Josh No Likey Eso-Charis,"Josh, are they really as bad as you say?LS are a christian band and you have no problem with them, and they have christian lyrics as well. I'm not a christian or anything but that doesn't keep me from listening to bands who are. Anywho...ESO-Charis is far from being 1 of the better bands of the genre. But since their vocalist just joined Norma Jean, I gave them a listen..They are decent. I consider Josh's 5 bucks for the CD and a shirt a good deal, but I doubt i'd pay $14.98 (Amazons price) for this cd."
1,horrible,"i got this cd along with a shirt at an LS show for 5 bones. I am glad i only payed 5. this is crap. i hate it when bands bring god into everything. the lyrics turn me off, its so onesided. and these people are obviously not open minded about anything. if you want jesus christ shoved down your throat then listen to this. the message is awful. the music is awful. the kid who says linkin park is awesome is a complete moron."
4,Primitive is still how to live,"I never thought the Cramps would come anywhere close to capturing the bare Elvis-on-Acid frenzy of PSYCHEDELIC JUNGLE but somehow they've overcome the mediocrity of their last few albums and gotten back to basics.Dr. F**ker M.D. (Medical Deviant) and Elvis F**king Christ will probably become live standards, and Taboo recalls the cool simplicity of Primitive or even maybe Green Door.While certainly not their best album, this is the best work they've done in years.If you've never bought a Cramps album before you might be better off with Bad Music For Bad People or Psychedelic Jungle, but honestly Fiends of Dope Island isn't the worst place to start."
5,Really Great Album,"I was really happy when the Cramps put out a new album after so long and I really think it's one of their best. With every album I think the recordings sound better, and Ivy's guitar playing is awesome. Their new line up is one of the best and this album is probably the closest to what it's like seeing them live. I'm really glad that their still kicking and doing what they love best. I love their classic albums, ""Psychedilic Jungle"" and ""Gravest Hit's"" but I really think this album is great too and the recordings are so much more clear and the music a lot harder. One of my favorite albums of the year. Lux and Ivy, Keep Rockin!!!"
5,Bike bell,"Love my new bell, delivery was quick, it looks just like the picture, easy to install and has a wonderful old fashion sound"
4,"Cute, one more time","Another charming entry in the Dog Who Saved Christmas collection comes from Anchor Bay. This time, the Bannister family is spending their vacation at a Rocky Mountain resort and familiar thieves led by Dean Cain make a return visit. This time, Uncle Randy (Casper Van Diem) is part of the mix and mayhem.This film is cute and is suitable for young viewers from ages 5 to 12. Older movie viewers will enjoy it for its' lightness and good casting.Bravo Anchor Bay Entertainment.Tim Lasiuta"
4,Christmas Movie,I liked this movie and it is a follow up to The Dog Who Saved Christmas. I'm a big fan of Elisa Donovan so I buy all of her films.
2,.,"They should have stopped with the first movie ""The Dog who saved Christmas"". I was dissapointed a lthough it was cute."
1,Don't spend your money!!,Not very good. Acting not great. Dragged on. There are many other Christmas movies to spend your money on.
3,An Epic Motorsport Event,"Sunday Mirror writer Kahn joined rallyists Peter Jopp and Willy Cave for the 16,000 mile 1970 World Cup Rally, a.k.a London-to-Mexico City. He details the construction of their car, a BLMC Morris 1800, and how it fared. There are many details of the route and the hardships faced, especially in South America where the roads were quite rough, poorly marked, and where they traveled above 11,000 feet through the Andes.It falls short in that it does not give details of the finish nor the finishers, as the Jopp/Cave/Kahn car fell short of being classified as a finisher by a mere 600 miles.Despite that lack of overall info, it is an interesting tale for those who have yearned to experience the famed Marathon rallies of the 1970s."
2,Bad,Why even give this two stars? 'Cause I normally like Pyun's martial arts related films. Rent first don't buy...I should've known better
1,Max Havoc - Curse of the Dagon,"This movie SUCKED big time! This movie is below 1 star. But, I've to rate it 1 star just to get my opinion up. Don't even bother BUYING IT! If you want to rent it, get a FREE COUPON RENTAL from Block Buster online. Yes, it's that bad!"
4,Cartoony Wild West fun!!,"This is a very fun game...provided the game's computer does not cheat. However, at certain points in the game, no matter a good a player thinks he or she is, the computer takes a cheap shot. Other than that, this game is worth playing. I used to play the coin-op version at a local pizza place and now that I have it for the SNES, I can play it for free anytime I want. There are four gunslinging studs in this game: Steve, Billy, Bob, and Cormano. Steve and Billy are pistoleers. Bob and Cormano are rifle/shotgun toters. The best character to use is Bob. He is pretty quick with pump-action rifle(s). His rifle shot is more accurate than Cormano's, but if you are looking for power, Cormano's shotguns are a little more powerful than Bob's rifles. If speed is your game, then Billy or Steve are the best....but you have to be a crack shot with the pistoleers or you can get killed quite easily. 4/5 because the computer cheats, otherwise a lot of fun! Definitely worth playing!"
5,An excellent retro SNES game,"The first time I played this game was at an arcade when I was 7. The place was set up so all the machines had unlimited continues, which was really nice. Anyways, 3 of my friends and I literally spent hours just playing Sunset Riders through again and again. It's that fun.The thing you have to understand about this game is that it's a simple side-scrolling action game, like maybe TMNT, but it doesn't try to be anything more! It's just simple, fun, classic gaming. Don't go in expecting it on the caliber of Zelda or Final Fantasy. But it's just as fun, or to me because I have the memmories to associate it with, it's more fun! And it's cheap too. So just get it."
3,Uh?,"Short Game. Ugly graphics too, but for some reason I found it oddly fun. I donno, maybe it's just me."
2,"Pretty dumb, you could skip this one","Sunset Riders is just like any of the TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtls) games except this one has cowboys and it's set in the old wild wild west.You play as 4 different sherriffs (Bob, Billy, Steve? and Cormano) and your objective is to take down the most evil and dangerous men in the wild wild west.O.k. this is what makes this game stupid, the enemy to hero ratio is completely off. There are always a lot more enemies than heroes on the screen for the most part and that makes this easy game a little confusing and a little too challenging seeing as how if you get hit like once or twice, you die and when a screen full of bad guys shoots 8 bullets in all different directions, it's kind of hard to didge.Turtles in Time is a much better 2 player game but if you're looking for a slight change of pace, here's your chance with this cowboy shoot em up."
4,greetings...,"wow.. kinda weird reviewing my own stuff but i figure.. what the heck... this is my second release.. first mixed cd was trance: an altered state of consciousness... this time, you'll notice i had complete freedom to do as i pleased with the cd and.. well i did... i hope you like it.... due out oct 24th.. my next cd.. the sunrise sessionsenjoy!jdp.s. dont be shy.. constructive criticism and email welcomecheers!"
4,nice,"I am confused how this comes off as epic, some songs are; some aren't. Personally, I love the epic stuff cuz it breathes beauty and life into the bland boring repetitive electronica that all the trendy people believe to be so amazing. I am tired of hearing that trance is overrated and dead..dammit it's not, its gorgeous, flowing music. The BT pick grew on me fast as do most of the songs, a couple of songs sound of out place, but as soon as you hit song 6 or 7 it just turns into everything I expected, ending with an extremely emotional song. (last song being my absolute favorite) But back to the actual review Good album, refined, worked through...if you like trance-altered state you will not be sorry. I am anxious to hear what Jason Dunne has to offer me in October."
4,It's alright,"Yeah it's pretty good I kinda wanted more out of it i'm not sayin it's bad it's alright State of discontent was the one that blew me away, but yeah check it out."
3,Meh...,"I used this postpartum in my sitz bath. It has a nice lemongrass-like scent, but I didn't find it to be more helpful than just plain salts. I also recommend using it in a muslin bag-- the tiny herb bits will get everywhere."
5,Petra Revival,"If you enjoy listening to Petra, this cd won't disappoint you. There are 2 power praise songs on this cd; the rest of the songs are great to listen to as well."
4,Always Loved Petra!,"Revival is a wonderful praise & worshp CD which I enjoyed immensely. Petra was THE pioneer for Christian Rock and they truly blazed the trail for the current genre.I do agree with other reviewers that it would have been great to have all of Petra return to the fold for this one. But times change and I give them credit for trying to inject some ""newness"" into their music but still hold on to the personna we die-hard Petra fans know and love.Let's face it though; we're all growing older. In the opening song, Revival, I did hear a slight aging in John's voice (sorry John), not that it made the song bad or anything.If you like Christian Rock and P&W, this is definitely worth having in your Petra collection. I cannot say it is my favorite Petra CD (and I have just about all of them) but I enjoyed it a lot."

1,Awful,"I bought the book primarilly for practice using a CD. If this is your purpose, don't but this book. THe CD is user unfriendly and primitive by modern standards. An whoah! What the others said about poor editing is exactly right. You can't practice in subject areas and their are no short quizzes."
5,"Pure, beautiful, jazz piano","I took a chance and bought this cd because it was in the clearance bin. Man, did I luck out! The entire program is far and away one of the most beautiful, purely melodic combination of Brazilian and classic jazz I have heard in many, mnay years. If you like melodies that are just squeezed out of every key with warmth, tender-loving care, and great feeling you must run to get this cd. No gimmicks, no stryaing too far from the melody, just beutiful, lucid, gorgeous music making. Hats off to Arturo and I am eagerly awaiting your next cd."
4,Good mystery; Great Atmosphere,"This book is a delight, not so much for the mystery, but because McConnell has taken obvious care and attention to creating full characters and capturing the atmosphere of Chicago in winter. The mixing of a hardboiled detective and a former Catholic nun leads not only to comedy, but to subtle tender growth in both characters. The closest you can come to a modern G. K. Chesterton."
4,"This does not work with LED lights, even the Home Depot brand that was reported to be OK","This dimmer switch has all the features that I needed when I replaced my room ceiling lights with LED's. Previous reviewers stated it didn't work well with controlling LED fixtures. However, one reviewer stated that it worked with the Home Depot brand LEDs....not true.This switch is great but it just isn't made to handle LEDs, too bad because i like the remote and the time delay feature."
4,Works with HD led's not Lowes.,"Hopefully my review helps someone. If you get the Sylvania LED's from Lowe's, they do not work (was a dancing disco in my kitchen). The Home Depot Ecosmart brand ones actually work with this dimmer.Found it out the hard way but in the end it works! Unless you like Disco dancing =)"
5,love it,What a wonderful gadget! I hated getting up to turn the light off. It is the clapper revised. Loving it!
5,Incredible Convenience,Best electrical upgrade ive ever done to my office. I love being able to dim the lights from my desk. Install was very easy aswell.
5,Lazy Man's dream,"This remote control was very easy to install and allows me to sit on the sofa and turn on, or dim the overhead recessed lights in the family room. It has a delay feature which lets me turn off the lights and get out of the room as the lights slowly dim and turn off.I plan to buy a few more for the bed rooms as well."
5,Easy and absolutely fantastic,"I am not going to duplicate what others have already said (and I've learned some from those reviews as well), this is a fantastic product.The package says ""installs in 15 minutes."" That's if you've never installed a light switch before. I have swaped switches before, and this only took me 5 minutes. Easy as pie. And I love it."
3,Not CFL-compatible,"If you want a dimmer for your nice energy-saving CFL bulbs, this one is not for you. If you attempt to install it with a CFL load, the bottom LED will just blink and the dimmer will be completely unresponsive. I called Lutron, and they confirmed that this model does not support CFL bulbs, and it may not be until the end of the year until they have one that does. Pity, as I really wanted a remote dimmer for my CFL spots."
5,Rarely quality,"The Lutron products have a rarely and uncomparable quality.Very good design and finish, much colors and designs.All Lutron products are high tech and very beautiful.Very Recomended."
5,Excellent and Simple Remote Dimmer,"The installation was easy and it worked perfectly. Everyone thought I was lazy for wanting this, but it's great when reclining in a room with overhead lighting. The functions of the simple switch are impressive and the price is well worth it!"
5,Beautiful and classy dimmer with remote control,This switch has it all. I highly recommend it. It made my life easier at a minimal cost. I wish i owned it a long time ago
1,Weak Signal,"The remote had a very weak signal. I literally had to stand 5 feet from the receiver, aim directly at it, and mash the buttons as hard as I could. One button did not even work."
2,A travel book without direction,"Twigger is a great writer at publishing adventure novels in which he starts the quest but never seems to complete it. His books are about growing up and finding himself, but he rarely finds his subject (BIG SNAKE). A self-help book for the over educated who are looking at making their mark by desperately trying to find their niche in life ie: being a writer."
3,Snakes and more snakes,"I liked this book - more of a travelogue than a snake book, but entertaining and inspiring. Went and saw some reticulated pythons afterwards, and thought about the world's longest snake... If you liked this book, try the Snakebite Survivor's Club also - hilarious and scary."
2,Wrong Choice,"This had quite a disappointing plot. Although in the start it seemed like it could get somewhere, upon reaching the end of the novel, there was really no personal character development WHATSOEVER on Hatsumi OR Ryoki's part. This story just displays how Ryoki USES Hatsumi. Personally, if I were the author, I would have made Hatsumi end up with Shinogu, who is a much better ideal. It seems completely unlikely that Hatsumi would choose an immature brat like Ryoki. Also, Hatsumi herself is not a good example setter for teens who read this novel. She has no self confidence at all and allows herself to be bossed around by anyone and everyone. All in all, this novel COULD HAVE gone somewhere but in the end it was a complete waste of time."
1,Read some other shoujo,"I borrowed this series from a friend and I read it all the way through. It really isn't anything unique which is fine...that's not the reason I hate it. The main character Hatsumi is an idiot. She can't think for herself and lets all the male characters push her around. She's a terrible female lead. Read a shoujo manga or any other manga for that matter, that has a smart female character in it. Hatsumi's idiocy is just too much--just sickening. I read it all to see if she grows a damn brain but she remains an idiot forever, it seems.There is no growth for her character or for the other characters either. Her sister is a far better character than her. If you want some good shoujo manga read Ouran Host Club instead. The female protagonist-- Haruhi has more brains in a strand of hair than Hatsumi has in the vast empty space which is her skull. Hot Gimmick is poo."
2,I'd have given it 5 stars if there weren't so much rape.,"Like my title says: I'd have given Hot Gimmick 5 stars if it didn't have so many ALMOST rapes. I read the first 4 Volumes and quit because it was too upsetting. I like the art, the characters (mostly), the storyline... It's really interesting and well-done. But when (spoiler) the main character was very nearly gang-raped, it was just too much. I couldn't read any more. If you get to that part and you're not upset, then you'll probably love the series. But if you're just considering buying it... I'd say read some in a store, to see what you think, before putting money into it."
3,Definitely not for younger girls...,"I'm honestly not sure how I feel about Hot Gimmick. I keep reading, because I find that I really do want to know what happens next. However, the romantic relationships portrayed are absolutely not healthy.The ""boyfriend"" in the story is both emotionally and physically abusive to the protagonist. Rather than stand up for herself, she takes all of this abuse in and assumes that something really is wrong with her. The author seems to try to excuse all of this bad behavior by explaining that the boyfriend had a difficult childhood and a mostly absent father. Of the supporting characters, the only people that see a problem with the abuse, are the ones that would be rivals for the protagonist's affections.I absolutely would NOT recommend Hot Gimmick to teenage girls - the story all but condones abusive relationships. There are so many other options out there that send a healthier message. Honey and Clover is one that comes to mind.Honey and Clover, Vol. 1 (v. 1)"
5,My girls LOVE this CD.,"We love this CD. My girls, even the one who can't talk yet carries the package over to me to ask me to put it on. The songs are a great mix of funny, touching, rocking, and relaxing. We like Wendy's other albums, too, but this one is currently getting the most play at our house."
3,Work does Matter,"This book Is good and i think that all women should read it. You probably may feel and have the same reactions as other women do. When women get hire at jobs that men usually do, later on women open the door for changes."
5,womens interest,"I think that this book should be assigned to every economics class, its a very interesting book about how women got their position in this society. It also acknowledges how women struggle to be were their at right about now. And she espresses herself so well by characterising other females and how they have achieved in your environment. I, as a reader got an interesting much powerful vibe from this book, it showed me how a womens roel in this society is very hard to play and kepp the ball rolling."
2,Fun for the first level. Then a downhill slide.,"I consider myself a very good gamer in the sense that I have good eye hand coordination and exellent timing. When I got this game for a buck, I figured it would be as good as the other tiny toons titles (bab's big break, Tiny toons for the nes). What I got was a game that was good for the first level and then pathetic afterwards. It really proves too much of a challenge too early. The only way that I beat the game was playing it through ""children"" mode. This took a lot of the fun out of it however because there are no boss battles. All in all, not a good game, try the other ones though."
4,instrumental masterpiece,"if your expecting yes or the moody blues forget it but if you want to hear an excellent keyboardist at work it's a must. his solo work is hard to find except this newer material. timecode is my favorite so far, which i have on vinyl as well as th story of i which i thought was moraz-moraz cause i couldn't decipher the i. wasn't sure if it was an i or a 1. it is excellent also. i was hoping to find other material here such as refugee,human interface,flags,and of course timecode.i guess i'll check back later and see if anything else is released. like i said at the beginning this cd is excellent keyboard work and great background music since it isn't cluttered with words."
2,Disappointed in Balloon animals book package,The item description stated that the book on balloon animals comes with balloons and a pump but it came with just the book so I was very disappointed as I then had to go out and buy balloons and a pump.
3,MUCH better than Aaron's other book!,"Unlike my review of Aaron's other book, I liked this one. Most of the animals are very nice for beginners but I absolutely love twisting the ram. I also do a modified lovebirds in a heart from this book. A few others here are standards (both the animal offered and the way they're twisted)and if you want a book that is inexpensive and good for beginners, then this one will do nicely."
3,"Good for getting started, but....",I found this to be a very good introduction to balloontwisting. I was making animals within minutes.If you just want to try balloon sculpture to see how you like it this is a good intro. But that's all it is. The 20 balloons with the book seem to have negligible value.
4,Well argued,"This book is a well argued, persuasive and scholarly study of the life of Caligula, a Roman emperor legendary for his supposed debauches. It is not a chronicle of Caligula's crimes--read ""The Twelve Caesars"" if that is what you want. Instead, it is a scholarly study that dismisses many of the stories about Caligula as lies, while still admitting that Caligula was an immature, unpleasant young man. At times it goes too far in rationalizing Caligula's deeds, and crosses the line in dismissing stories about him as lies. But still, it is a good book that nobody who is interested in the Julio-Claudians should be without."
3,Caligula and Confusion,"While I must admit that this book is a must read for those interested in the politics and extravagences of the Roman Caesars, this book does little to ""prove"" what the author intends to prove: that Caligula was just a victim of circumstances. The author goes out of his way to show the reader that good ole little boots did nothing that his cohorts did not do as well (see references to Augustus, Tiberius, and Claudius). The author tries to put a certain spin on the rumour mill of the day pertaining to Caligula by stating that Selonicus, Dio, et al. have a grudge againt him and that is why they were unappealing in writing about him. The bottom line is that Caligula was a depraved, sick human being given the power of a god and much more than willing to accept and play the role. Any justification for his actions would be irresponsible and not accepting of the true facts."
2,Let down,"I was very disappointed with this book. Why do poeple find Caligula fascinating? It was because of his obscure, cruel, fascinating behavior. Unfortuantely, Mr. Barret Tends to focus, often too in depth, of the family lineage of Caligula. I swear he spends more time talking about how someone is related to some minor character than our beloved emporer. He makes more references to other people than he does the title character. I almost gave up on this book God knows how many times. But, the hope that he would eventually talk about one of Caligula's crazy antics made me press on, often bored to tears. If you want a good history on the former emporer, I would highly recommend the episode Of Biography that A & E did on him. I would not read this book unless you are an insomniac and can't afford medicine."
5,Stig of the Dump,"In England, it was required of us to read Stig of the Dump at school. I am very glad of this because if it had not been required reading, I may not have had the pleasure of reading such a great story. Being a girl I always wanted to read typical girl books, and this book(at least from the title) would seem more for boys, but let me assure you it is a wonderful book for children of all ages. I am now reading it to my 6 year old daughter and she is loving it."
3,Whoever gave this five stars was out of their mind!!,"Are you crazy? Okay. The only song that I like from this CD is Solo a tu lado quiero vivir and I want to spend my whole life with you, or my life with you... ha, ha! I don't listen to the CD much. First of all, ""What he don't know"" should be ""What he doesn't know."" It's clear that they can't speak English. Jyve V, don't even think about recording an english album, please! This CD was released a month ago, and it's so bad that only two people reviewed it before I did! That is just how good this CD is. Of course, you'd buy anything when you're a fan, but talent? Ha, ha, ha! The guys don't know what that word is. It's not in their dictionary. Nice try, Jyve V. I will wait for the next one, that is, if I buy it!"
5,Best spy series ever.,"The Sandbaggers is not what most people would expect -- it's about the politics of intelligence wrok, the planning, and most of all, the waiting to here if an op has gone off. The acting is good, the scripts and verisimilitude superb. It's a great look into the espionage game circa 1978-80.The transfer leaves something to be desired, but it's still watchable. Here's a show that could do with a restoration job."
1,"good show, poor remastering","The digital remaster has made the picture clearer, but introduced artifacts such as white squares at the corners of some scenes and occasional white lines. I returned the first set and am now on my second, but the artifacts are still there. Since these aren't present in the original DVDs I rented, I assume they were introduced during a sloppy remastering. Too bad, I enjoy this series."
2,More was expected of the product,"It was very delayed and only until 15 days after I found out that he had already arrived, lacking information on the product tour but arrived safely. Thank you."
5,Typically excellent Vangelis/Anderson music,"About two decades ago I discovered Vangelis (thanks to Chariots of Fire), and soon after I gobbled up all works of his I could get my hands on. One of these works was Portraits, which had Vangelis and Anderson together--I fell in love w/ their music and have bought all the music I can with the two of them performing together.Short Stories does not disappoint. Some of the music I have on other CDs, but others are new to me. All pieces are great. This is a very good addition to the library of all Vangelis/Anderson-philes."
1,Terrible,"This TV version of one of the great psychological novels ever is terrible. One main problem is that one can't condense a 500 page book into a 2 hour TV movie and make it good at the same time. Avoid it, but see it only if it comes on TV once again. Not worth the rental price."
2,"Adequate, but still cannot hold a candle to the book.","You could watch this adaption of Dostoevsky's masterpiece rather than reading the book. Although, I'm not sure why you would want to. It's not a bad adaption, but you would be doing yourself a great favour to read the book first.However, I must say that Patrick Dempsey plays a better Raskolnikof than I would have expected, considering that... well it's Patrick Dempsey. And credit must go to the casting of Julie Delpy: the actress with whom I personally envisioned the role of Sophia, when I read the novel."
1,ha,"You call this a correct adaptation of Dostoevsky's wonderful and chilling novel, I dont think so.This is even worse then the 1930's version. I know that it was hard taking a 500 pg. novel and turning it into a 90 minute film, but for Christsakes why didnt he just make a 3 hour version. I found myself wondering throughout the movie what happened to the vulnerable, scared, depressed, excitied, and strange characters that Fyodor created. This is what I call a disaster of a movie."
3,Not what i espected,"I saw the movie, to get some ideas, cause i am doing Raskolnikov this year in a local play (2 Hours). But we and my team only got ideas for the dressing. Raskolnikov, is pretty obvius, so is the text. I thought it was really stupid when he tells lizabeta ""You shouldnt be here"" like he had everything else under control and he stops to do some philosophy in the middle of the ""CRIME"", i mean it's ok if you use it to do the expression of the character more complex, but not actually saying it. Razumizhin should be more complex, and more funny, i liked when dovstoyevsky used him to stop the tension of the reader a little, with his talk about his translations, and the epilogue was pretty poor."
5,FAMILY FILM,"An excellent film that the family can watch, with no swearing, nudity, violence or blasphemy. it is the story of a soldier who comes home from the war to find his parents dead and brother in prison. He wanders from place to place until he meets a mystical figure who directs him to the valley of light. He finds himself here and helps to change other eople in the process. well worth a view, it will brighten your day."
4,A GOOD HALLMARK MOVIE,"Very nice. Sad at times. Strong characters and I really like a movie that shows a man with strong character as this movie does. I wont spoil it but this is a great Hallmark movie. It's what I'd expect from Hallmark, no swearing, and no nudity."
4,GOOD BOOK,IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED CRAPS THEN THIS WILL GIVE YOU A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF GAME.YOU REALLY WON'T GET IT TILL YOU PLAY. THERE ARE SEVERAL SITES TO PLAY FOR FUN AS WELL. THESE 2 TOOLS WILL HELP. GO PLAY. GOOD LUCK.
2,IT'S OK ONLY ONE SONG I WANTED AND I LIKED IT BETTER ON A VARIOUS ARTISTS CD !,IT'S OK IF YOU LIKE THIS GROUP !
1,Anyone wants it?,"I bought this book because the review spoke about a ""pragmatic and practical"" approach, and ""how CSS actually works in current major browsers"". The reality is that this book lists the properties (I can have that from the W3C web site) and rates a property ""safe"", ""unsafe"" or ""partial"" - but almost no explanation what the implementation of this property actually causes in what browser. Vital information for the real world use of CSS is non-existent, not even caveats that certain properties, when applied to certain elements, can cause certain browsers to crash. In my opinion, this book is useless. Anyone wants it?"
5,Excellent intro and reference,"This is truly an excellent resource for webdesigners stuck in the dark, old HTML 4 days. The book is clearly organized, well indexed, and easy to read. While largely written in a textbook style, there are bits of humor that do not slow down the flow at all.Along with covering all CSS1 & CSS2 elements, Schengili-Roberts also previews the CSS3 specs, which should get you excited about the day when browsers decide to support it.Highly, highly recommended."
4,Almost didn't buy it--glad I did!,"I alsmot didn't buy this book after reading the Publisher's weekly review. I had the impression that Lilly spent her time in some sort of dark depression wandering through a mystery with no focus. Turns out the book was well-written, the ending to the mystery followed the clues, and while the book dealt more solidly with the violence in Lilly's past it was well-placed and not contrived. I enjoyed the book. The characters were as well-developed as in her past books and so was the story."
4,Best of the Series,"I thought this book (#5) was the best of the series! I was all wrong about who the perpetrator was, and I was pleased with the way the mystery was resolved. This one was darker than the previous four books, but it was very much in line with who Lily Bard is. I was glad to see the character address certain issues that seemed so obviously to stalk her from book 1. Would love to have a sixth book in the series to enjoy."
5,A wonderful Series,"I love this series, and this newest addition didn't disappoint me. Lily continues to grow and change, both in her personal and professional life. I thought Ms. Harris combined the mystery, with Lily' personal struggles to come to grips with her past and future, very well. I hope there will be more Lily, Jack, and Shakespeare Arkansas."
3,A good book but...,"I like the Lily Bard novels. I enjoy reading them on my kindle. However, this book was absolutely riddled with spelling and grammatical errors! I don't know if that is just the book as a whole or specifically the kindle edition, but as someone who notices this sort of thing while reading, it was VERY distracting. That is definitely something that needs to be fixed. The content of the book is enjoyable as always. I like that Lily is a dynamic and complex character. The mysteries are interesting and follow the clues well. I would be sad if this is all we get on Miss Bard, but I do like the way everything was wrapped up."
