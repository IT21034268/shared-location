1,poor packaging,First unit and 2nd unit arrived damaged and bent to the point of having to return them. Decided after 2nd one to go ahead and select a different model. Not an ideal scenario for a Christmas gift.
3,"Cool container, lame spices","I bought this spice rack since I needed spices but didn't have room in the cabinet. The container for it is great, nice looking. But the spices given are a joke for the most part. Some of the things I have never even heard of. Also, how can a spice rack not even include cinnamon or cumin or cayenne or red pepper flakes? They put some odd things in there. So, I just emptied the containers and added my own. I went to the craft store and bought stick-on labels and re-labeled all the spices so they look uniform. Bottom line- buy it for looks and then use your own in their containers, the spices provided are not very useful in everyday cooking...at least not in my house."
1,came broken,"this spice tower is the epitemy of bad design. The vertical pieces are barely tack welded on, so they broke easily. Even after I fix it, it is still going to be unbalanced and wobbly. The spice selection were strange; no sage?? This item is an example of how not to engineer something. Save your money, but something else."
1,DON&quot;T BUY,"This rack is a piece of crap! I comes unassembled, with NO DIRECTIONS! When put together the obvious way, the pieces don't match up and it literally falls apart! For $50.00 it's a total rip off. I sent it back right away!!! It's flimsy and extremely cheaply made. What a joke. Save your money and the aggrevation."
1,Not Stainless Steel,I purchased this item on the web from target and when I received it I tested to see if it was stainless steel. The way you test is to use a magnet and it should not stick if it is stainless steel. Well it stuck. It looked cheap. I guess what you are really paying for is the spices. I would not recommend it if you really want a stainless steel rack versus a bright chrome.
4,One of my favorite movies.,I like how the toy soldiers come to life and act out as if they were in a real war. It's a movie for all to see.
5,it was very action packed but more of a 13/16 year old movie,big company who wanted to build toys that would have more action and more wepons and so the toys could talk and interact with the children a little boy gets the shipment that went to his dads store we he did sometime later they came alive there was good ones verses the bad ones
2,"Nice effects, but lacking everywhere else","As an adult, I found the movie to be watchable and mostly enjoyable. However, the movie is severly lacking in many areas such that it can't hold a torch to movies such as Toy Story or any of the other animated movies out there. This is a 'see once' movie. Borrow it from the local video store, but I wouldn't waste my money buying it. And despite the stars of the movies being toys, this movie certainly portrays toys and violence in a slightly disturbing manner and it isn't a movie I would recommend to kids."
2,"Wonderful plot, unneeded profanity","Unfortunatley to get the PG-13 rating, a flurry of profanity was spewed at the start of movie. This is a film my 5 year old would have loved but he wont be able to see it... too bad, Face it we can concuminicate much more effectively without the a.. holes,and the G..Damm it's"
4,Gorgo fun,"Action packed adventure. A movie the whole family will enjoy. I loved all of the Gorgonites. Each one is unique. After watching the movie once, we needed to find it to buy we liked it so much. Had a lot of comedy."
2,"Has potential, but doesn't use it....","One of the things that got me about this film, is that the COMMANDO ELITE were touted as the good guys -- the toys to root for -- in the advertising campaign for this film. But instead, when you sit down and watch this movie, you are made to cheer on the ultra-lame and boring Gorgonites.Maybe if the studio had marketed this film a little more correctly, it would have been more enjoyable. But that's not really my complaint. There are nagging plot holes (like creating a whole army of feminine dolls from ONE SUPER CHIP...how'd they do that?), and the script is just so weak. I really liked the premise, but the film focuses way too much on human beings we don't really care about in the first place. Also, some of the violence is extremely out of place. It just tottaly doesn't belong (this includes a scene where a toy uses a mini-electric saw to draw blood from the main character). All in all, this film leaves something to be desired. I wouldn't buy it."
1,wont play in the US DVD players,"The DVD arrived in excellent condition. Every player I tried to play DVD in, itsaid the same message about, not legal to play in this country. So I was upset as I could not believe it. I wasnt gonna say anything,but since you emailed me I thought I better.Rick"
1,Deeply disturbing,"A truly disturbing film.Is this what we now expect children to enjoy?Dismemberment, nail gun attack and Gwendy horror clone dolls.To compare the film in any way to Toy Story is an an insult. Where Toy Story had invention and wit, this film has sadism and stereotypical violence more suited to a R certificate.To call the film mindless ""mind candy"" is almost as worrying, if we do not ""mind"" such films being made, then maybe we will inadvertently condone their content.I truly hope not.The only redeemable scenes involved the Gorgonites, a film about them and their struggle to find their homeland would probably have put ""bums on seats"" throughout the world. But alas, that would have required skills of writing and character development, neither of which was included within the films handsome budget.Steer well clear and tell 10 people you know to do the same."
1,"Never, Never try this!","I got this at used CD/Video shop and am not worrying at all because I will get 75% refund when I return this. 25% is good investment for this good lesson. Frankly, this movie was disgusting. I don't know what they had in their minds when it made. For whom, for what? Your children will learn money rules the world. Even after evil toys(yeah, I mean evil small soldiers) almost destroyed their homes, checks of the evil business man can make the parents smile!(Was that 2nd grader who made this?) And the boy/girl, our main characters even smiled to this man. Do they think he is cool because he got power and money and smart plan to sell that deadly toys to south america as warfare? Very very weird. Lots of violence(Ok, there was no blood). The girl looked really wicked/pleasured when she was driving the mower to crush the toy soldiers. In conclusion, this movie seems to have many very critical flaws. Why did you join this crab, Stan?"
3,A so-so movie.,"A lot of the reviewers seem to be hung up on the PG rating of the movie and who should see it. Let's just rate it on its own merit. The special effects are weak. The scene where they trap the hero and heroine out on the front lawn makes the Soldiers look just like harmless dolls. They just didn't look dangerous because the animation was done so poorly. And, yes, the plot does have some holes. One reviewer pointed out the one where you wonder how all the female Soldiers were made from one chip. It does have its moments, like when Mom is volleying the incoming tennis balls. But this movie just didn't grab me, or hold me on the edge of my seat. Not great, but not terrible, either. Three stars."
1,This video really sucked,"At first, the movie was really good, but then it started. The small soldiers and gorgonites did not blend in with the backround, there was too much violence, and the comedy just wasnt funny. You would be better off buying another movie."
1,Not recommended for children!!!!,"We recently rented this movie and what a disappointment. My kids 8 years and 5 years were not at all entertained. In fact my five year old questioned the dangers of the power line scene. While I know movies like this are ""make believe"" I still think it was way too violent and some of the scenes gave a very false impression on the reality of danger. Do not waste time, money or your child's interests on this one."
1,DVD does not play,"My daughter was so excited to find this DVD on Amazon. It arrived in a timely fashion (thanks Amazon Prime) and to our dismay it does not play on ANY of our 3 DVD players or Playstation 3. The error says ""wrong region"" - we are sending it back with heavy hearts...**Update**After I posted this, I noticed the company added the ""disclaimer"" to this product. Still leaving it as 1 star!***"
5,Excellent movie,"""Small Soldiers"" is an excellent movie. Its proably a little too violent for small kids like 6 and 7, but the concept is good. The ending is speciafially awesome when the good guys win!"
1,Didnt clearly state this video was not in english,I bought this DVD for my 17 year old son for christmas.. it was his watch everyday movie when he was little. When he opened it he got to really looking at it and we discovered that it was all in Italian. I didnt see in the movie description where it stated that it was in a foreign language.
2,MISTAKE,"I didn't realize that ""Region 2"" meant that it wouldn't play on DVD in the U.S. Make sure if you are from the US or Canada that you always buy a Region 1 DVD otherwise it will be unplayable in DVD Player :( My son was very diaappointed that the Christmas present he had been wanting didn't work."
1,Have not yet received this item,"I have yet to receive this item. I ordered on the 14th of November. I wanted this item for my children for Christmas, doubting it will be here. Very disappointed."
1,Terrible! DVD never worked,I purchased this for my son. received it on time but it never worked. I put in 3 different DVD players and nothing. Called twice and got no response. o'well i should have taken my chances on eBay.
1,"Dissapointing, all special effects, no movie.","How sad, good performances, but this seems indicative of most movies of late- ""lets spend all the money on special effects and for about the human actors"". I was so saddened that this was the late great Phil Hartmans last movie. Cute idea, but the (countless) explotions just don't carry this (you thought Gremlins had violence for violence sake??)"
4,WHERE IS PART TWO !,THIS IS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. THERE IS A LITTLE DRAW BACK IN THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE A BIT VIOLENT FOR YOUNGSTERS TO UNDERSTAND. IT PROBABLY WOULD BE ALOT MORE POPULAR IF THE VIOLENT TEMPERS OF CHIP AND HIS GANG WASN'T SO HARSH. HOPEFULLY THE MAKERS OF THIS WILL COME OUT WITH A SEQUEL REAL SOON THAT IS A BIT MORE ACCEPTABLE IN CONTENT TO THE GENERAL AUDIENCE AND THAT IS MORE SUITABLE FOR YOUNGER KIDS. IF THEY DID THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY MAKE SOME SORT OF GOLD MINE NOT ONLY WITH THE MOVIE BUT TOYS TOO!AND OPEN DOORS FOR MORE PEOPLE TO SEE THE 1st ONE. OR HERE'S AN IDEA THEY MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER A RE-RELEASE ON AN EDITED VERSION MAYBE A LITTLE MORE KID FRIENDLY.ANYHOW ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT I THINK THE FILM MAKERS ARE MISSING OUT ON. It's A GOOD MOVIE WITH ALOT OF POTENTIAL. PARENTS MIGHT WANT TO VIEW THIS ONE FIRST.WE LIKED IT ENOUGH TO NAME OUR PUG DOG - ARCHER.
1,Terrible experience,"I placed an order for a movie on 6/25 and as of today 7/27 I still haven't received it. Terrible customer service, they keep telling me to check with the post office and giving me the run around when I ask them to re-ship or refund me. This is the last time I order from them, buyers beware they are not professional and will not take responsibility when an order is not received!"
1,what was this?,"this movie is/was too gruesome for anybody!!! too much blood and action and guts flying around it was more like watching a movie about a war!!! it had all the blood only ""battery fluid"" yuck and also why did they make this and point it at kids?!?! it's ridiculus how much blood and guts were flying all over the town!!! and that one part when the kid stuffed that one action figure down a garbage disposal yuck! and then they buried him and tore his head off!! if you like movies about war then this is for you"
2,"Peter, are you kidding?","Pro-choice on mental health by Peter Dizozza is a weird CD. In fact, I don't know what to think of it. Is this guy serious? According to his website ""he devotes his working life to creating innovative and stimulating entertainment and helping his audience develop confidence, enlightenment and serenity through self-expression"". He can't really sing and the 'mini-plays' on this CD ramble on without making much sense. So check it out if you're into really weird stuff, but don't blame me if you fall asleep!"
4,Peter Moon,Lovely music. I purchased this CD for the Hawaiian Lullaby song. I do dance in the pool to this song with water aerobics group.
5,Loving It!,"Not only is the price right, but my son loves this shoe. He says they're comfortable. I have to make him wear other pairs of shoes, because he wants to wear them all of the time."
2,Midnight Oil has U2-itis,"That is to say, when Oil, like U2, were at their prime, they made some of the most exciting, beautiful, and meaningful guitars-keyboards-drum-vocal rock ever. And lately, also like the boys from Ireland, they've felt the need to experiment more and more with their musical sound, adding all sorts of synthesized or otherwise unnatural elements and thus destroying the essence of the sound that made Diesel and Dust one of the greatest albums of the 80s. The lyrics are still driven by real and aptly-put political and social concerns, but without good, interesting, and enjoyable music to back those lyrics up, it just ain't the same. I hope that both Oil and U2 return to their more acoustic roots very soon."
2,A disappointment for a true Oils fan,"The only memorable tracks (What Goes On and White Skin Black Heart) were already released on their ""best of"" album. If you've got that album, you don't need Redneck Wonderland. In fact, save yourself the pain of listening to an unmemorable album that tarnishes an incredible career.I have every previous Oils disc and each one has its own character and depth. Unhappily, I found only tiresome power chords and uninspired filler on this album. I had a bad feeling as soon as I read the title. Depressing."
1,"Sorry Guys, this one is just plan BAD !!!! (Zero stars)","I guarantee,if you are a fan of Midnight Oil's: Earth & Sky & Moon(on my desert island disc list), Diesel & Dust, Blue Sky Mining, 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, Red Skies in the Sunset or any other Oil record actually...you will want to pass on this ill conceived, extremely poorly written body of songs!I have nothing good to say about this LP and it boggles this listeners mind to read the great reviews written here about the record (and which influenced/suckered me into buying it)- I heard nothing good songwise on my copy and it has since been traded back to my used CD store (joining a pile of six other returned copies). I suppose, the fanatical Midnight Oil fan, who would gladly buy an LP of lead singer Peter Garrett farting and call it brilliant, would rate this rubbish so highly (and would explain the great reviews here), but this descriminating longtime fan calls a pass on this dud!"
1,pitiful,"This is simply put garbage. You can try to soften the blow by calling it experimental, but you still have to listen to it. They're missing the melodies/rock edge that make them so good."
5,One of the Oils' most powerful works in years.,"That's not a drum machine. It's Rob. The rest of the album follows that trend. It's hard, abrasive and utterly magnificent. For those of you that decry synths, remember that the Oils have been using them since the early 80's. And like 10, 9, 8, Redenck Wonderland is a powerful album full of songs destined for classic status, if only we could get them out of our heads the first time around. It may not be the Oils that everybody thinks of, surface-wise, but the force of politcal rightousness is burning stronger than ever on Redneck Wonderland. Despite Sony's lack of promotion, this is an album not to be missed."
4,Patience,"Patience is a virtue.The first time I listened to this CD from one of my favorite bands, I was a little put off. It did not have the instant appeal of most of the band's previous work and the whole thing left me feeling a bit put off, alienated, and disappointed. But since this was the Oils I knew there had to be some redeeming feature to this.As I listened to it more, individual songs became to stand out. ""Cemetery In My Mind,"" for example has now become a favorite and other songs such as ""What Goes On,"" are well worth having.Admittedly, this is not the best Oils album, and certainly not the place to begin for neophytes. I'd prefer to be able to give it 3 and a half stars, but Amazon does not make this an option. It is, however, an album that has many rewards for the patient listener."
2,Out of Step,"I saw the album at the record store, sat down to listen on a listnin' station, and couldn't listen to anything the whole way though. I love Midnight Oil from 79 to 90 but this was grungy pap with overdone bass and too much pop-grungerock. Even the lyrics were disappointing. I know their politics are still great, but the message was more muddled than I expect. My least favorite album so far."
2,"Not ""easy listening"", that's for sure!","I've loved the Oils for a good 10-12 years now. This is the first album in that time that I just can't take a real liking too. The messages are just as strong as ever, and I like that, but the medium gives me a headache. While I appreciate their efforts to grow musically, only a few tracks on this album connect(White Skin Black Heart, Great Gibber Plain, Safety Chain Blues). I will put this one in the back of my case, take it out once or twice a year, and see if it ages gracefully. I'm looking forward to the next US tour, and praying the don't dig too deep into this material."
2,Let's hope for a new CD release soon,"This is actually my second review. The first was axed because I had given this CD one star. This CD is disappointment. At first, Breathe was a disappointment as well, then it grew on me and several of the songs are viewed as creative. However, this CD is never ending noise. If the Oils could only find their creative past.... After second listening, it's still noise."
4,Midnight Oil gets stoned. And Goes Heavy.,"I heard songs like ""beds are burning"" and labelled them crap. And then this album comes out, it really seems to widen it's scope. It still talks about all the political issues that attract an older audience, and then it becomes heavy (and don't give me all that ""this isn't heavy, i'll show you heavy (blah blah)"" bullcrap. It's like a party in your ears. And even if it is a ""save the kangaroos"" party, it still rocks."
2,"It's Midnight Oil's ""Monster""","While it's easy to condemn Midnight Oil for this loud, obnoxious recording and claim that they have lost their sound, let's step back a moment. Many bands have tried a new sound for one album and come back to produce ""better"" music on later albums. Look at REM. Frankly, ""Monster"" was a flop. If you don't believe me, check out any used CD shop. You'll find MANY copies of ""Monster"" and no copies of any of their other recordings. They experimented with a new sound and then returned to their roots. I think Midnight Oil is doing the same. Skip this album unless you are a die-hard fan and wait for the next release."
2,Need to refind their roots,"The lyrics on this CD are great, but the music leaves something to be desired. Oils have created great, addictive albums in the past, such as ""10,9,8,7. ."" and ""Diesel and Dust"", songs that hit with force from the beginning and had lyrics that made you think sewn in. They made you want to listen to that one CD exclusively for months, and then some. This just isn't the kind of stuff that made them famous. This is a grunge-like song that just doesn't go with Oils message or reputation. If you're looking for the sound of ""Diesel and Dust"", ""Blue Sky Mining"" or ""10, 9, 8. . "", then buy those albums, because you won't find that sound here. The sound here sounds just kind of trendy, early 90s stuff. They should take the lyrics from this CD and put it on a new one with a new sound; that sound being similar to the one they had back in their late 80s/early 90s or that of 82. I worship Midnight Oils, but this just isn't their greatest achievement."
4,A Redder Shade of Neck,"Just when you thought Midnight Oil was the greatest group in the world, they release a lackluster album like 1996's Breathe. Thankfully, Redneck Wonderland forgoes the pseudo-country feel of Breathe and proves that Midnight Oil are still relevant. Songs like Concrete and Cemetary In My Mind shake you and almost force you to turn up the volume. This may be too intense for some. For Oil newbies, check out Earth & Sun & Moon, Blue Sky Mine, or Diesel and Dust first.[DW]"
4,Excellent new sound; intense; yet some songs miss,"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous two reviewers -- this is a strong album, that with a little airplay and SOME work by Sony, would win some converts over to the Oils. If this new style could be compared to anything, I feel it would be Rage Against the Machine, but with intelligent lyrics and maturity. To put it quite simply, some of these songs rock so hard you'll wonder how your speakers can handle it; combine this crunching sound with lyrics that are at times angry, at times reflective, and always interesting, and you have Redneck Wonderland, a disk definitely worth buying. Unfortunately, ""Return to Sender,"" and ""Drop in the Ocean,"" are 2 weak tracks; on ""RTS,"" the Oils sound like a cheap Vegas lounge act, while on ""Drop,"" the style does not belong on this album. More power to them though, for the creative effort, even if I don't agree with those 2 songs. Check this out!"
4,Wow!,"I mean, this has nothing to do with classic Midnight Oil, and that's the weird and amazing thing about it.The Oils were able to totally reinvent themselves and their music. This album is really different and good, and one of the best rock albums released in 1998.""Comfortable Place on the Couch"" is a somber, complex and deep song. ""Cemetery in My Mind"" is another gem. ""Return to Sender"" is un-Oil. But the really stand-out track is ""Safety Chain Blues"", with it's dark and slow pace, really impresssive!I may be gone out of my mind, but this album is probably in their top 3 ever."
5,Gets better and better with repeated listenings,"Different. But the more I listen, the more I like this recording... living in the midst of a somewhat Redneck Wonderland, I enjoy this."
3,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I bought this CD for just one song (Blind Man Blues) that I heard on XM Radio's Bluesville. But I was pleasantly surprised after hearing the entire album, that most of the CD was very good. I had never heard Bob Stroger before but I will look for more of his work."
4,sly mongoose,"i was turned on to the musical word of lionel belasco through the ghost world sound track. i loved the songs, ""miranda"" and, ""venezuela."" with the purchase of this disc, i was hoping to pick up more great calipso music. luckily for me (and you), it's full of dazzling and highy energetic tunes. the piano stylings of belasco and the vocal efforts of houdini are truly unique, unlike anything i've come across before. check this one out."
3,you still need some one else for full pleasure,"This feels so good. However, it isn't that great if you have to do it yourself. Your arms get tired, and your hand starts to go numb. It kind of defeats the purpose, unless you have someone who is willing to let you relax, and them do all the work! In that case, this is the thing for you!"
1,Item pictured was not item recieved!,"I ordered this massager because I had read great reviews about it. To my surprise, when I received it, it was a different model. I paid $20 extra for this model because I wanted something of quality for my girlfriend. The model they actually sent me I could have got for $20 cheaper from EBay. I feel cheated and like I was ripped off. I contacted the vender and when I told them of this they simply cut off communication and no longer answered my emails."
2,short handle small footprint,"motor was strong and has infra-red LEDS that warm, however the dual head does not"
5,Kept me on the edge of my seat,"I have lived in Olean, NY my entire life, and have heard many stories about this house. I have seen the house, I have talked to people that have had strange experiences on and near the property. A few years ago I had the oppurtunity to read Clara's book, and I can agree with some of the other reviews it was difficult to put down. I read the book in about two days. The book is formatted like a diary, which I thought was interesting. It is pretty spooky, and will keep you on the edge of your seat."
3,Amazing if really true!,"I am a paranormal investigator and if all the things that Mrs. Miller says actually happened, I believe it would have made headlines around the world. I believe that something strange did happen to her family but I get the feeling a little salt was poured on for flavor. If all this is really true, I sympathize with the entire family and would apologize whole-heartedly but I found myself saying, ""yeah right""."
2,A ghostly flip-flop,"While, I found the book readable, I felt that it was in a ""rough-draft"" mode. The haunting that was described was scary enough, but the inconsistent telling of the story and the flip-flopping in the time line of events made it a sometimes tedious read. I felt that with the number of terrifying episodes this family went through in the years of living in this house, the book could have been far more richly detailed and I was somewhat disappointed in it's lack of real substance. The book was entertaining if you like a light read."
3,Sitting on a fence . . .,"I think this book is ""good"" and entertaining and creepy enough, but I can't stop wondering why on Earth they stayed in that house for SO long, and especially why they subjected their poor kids to it!! I would have moved out and lived in a tent for God's sake, rather than subject my kids and animals to all that chaos. That being said, it makes me wonder if there was a fair amount of embellishment in this story."
4,Creepy,"I had been hearing stories about this house but just recently read the book. I am hooked! This house is not far so on a lunch break a co-worker and I went to check it out. The house has peeling paint and looks neglected, but VERY real. The author's writing style is very earthy-like having a conversation with someone.A great read for anyone but especially those in this part of NY."
2,Slow moving and tedious,"The story is more about the family's not too exciting life and relationships, than it is about a haunting. Read it if you can keep awake."
3,Short book but a good read!,I would reccomend this book if you like books that are a little creepy and can read through in a day or two.
5,"A Definitive Book, it says it all.","Everything I've been looking for, all the originals and all the repros, described and compared. What's right and what's wrong and how to fix it, care for it and even how to make some of the parts! I have originals and repros, I shoot them and tune them as needed, and this book fills the bill. One of the most valuable books I own."
4,This Book is destined to be THEE CLASSIC on Old West S&Ws !,"This is one GREAT BOOK on the Smith & Wesson Big caliber revolvers of the Old West,long needed in the fields of lovers of the Old West,Cowboy Action Shooters,Old West Historians, Smith & Wesson collectors, gunsmiths,and firearms collectors,it also offers a wonderful in depth coverage of the company itself and the times, much of it never presented before.Dave Chicoines credentials to experience in this field are un-matched by any other, as firearms affectionado's well know.His writing style is clearcut so novice or long time buffs can bothget the most out of it,the photo and illustrations top notch,plus he covers the modern clones of these same famous revolvers.Move over Colt, Daves book is going to be a ""MUST HAVE"" that will be the standard by which others will try to reach and put S&W; revolvers in their proper place in Old West History, largely ignored until now.A really great book !"
4,S&W Sixguns of the old west,Nice book. Lot of information about older S&W revolvers. Belongs to every S&W collector's bookshelf.
2,He broke the rules!,"This book put me off Peter Lovesey's books for 25 years. I'm giving it a couple of stars because it was fun to read -- right up until the end. I love murder mysteries, and though I'm not too much of a stickler for mystery novel ""rules,"" this book's ending broke them so badly I nearly threw the book at the wall. I can't say what this cardinal sin was without revealing the ending, but if you're an ardent fan of, say, Agatha Christie, because of the way she plotted her books, avoid this one.I'm back to reading Lovesey, and he is a wonderful writer. My advice is to avoid this one and read anything else by him."
4,FUN & GAMES,"Good product. No problems. Fun game. I enjoy playing this game, just wish more than 3 people can play at a time."
1,Warning to Mac Users,"I was a big fan of the YDKJ games in the 90s, and I was excited to see that the two newer versions were supposed to be Mac-compatible. I purchased YDKJOL and was disappointed to discover that it does not work on newer Macs (MacBook or MacBook Pro).The game itself might be a lot of fun, but I am not able to comment on that."
2,Sequel lacks the budget and performances of the original,"Although I really enjoyed the original movie, ""Fortress 2: Re-entry"" is disappointing in comparison. The film offers a promising storyline: John and Karen Brennick are shown 10 years later with their son, hiding from the MenTel Corporation. John is eventually captured and sent to a prison space station to serve his sentence for having another child, while Karen and her son are still being pursued by MenTel. Again, John is driven to escape from this dismal prison. The magic that made the first ""Fortress"" work is not present in this film. The special effects are of poor quality, and the actors' performances are not very good. This movie may be worth renting just to see what happens to the characters from the first film."
2,It was never going to compare to the original I suppose ....,"All the same,this sequel to one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Action hits of the '90's is a big let-down.It looks almost like in a cheap video film the way it is shot,the budget restraints more noticeable than originally anticipated.The whole thing is acted rather blankly by all those involved too,giving expressionless performances,with the exception perhaps of Lambert and Patrick Malahide,giving a gleefully sly,condescending performance as the evil prison warden.But perhaps the worst thing about it is the dialogue.Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery and all,but there was hardly a word spoken in this that wasn't borrowed from some other flick,like ''perhaps instead of working against each other,we should work with each other'' and ''I never wanted it to end like this''.This is best admired on the levels of a respectful interpretation of modern action films,rather than anything like or resembling the previous film."
1,Watch it on fast-forward...Zero stars!,"Hey guys, are you serious? I understand it's a B-class movie (that's why I don't expect Oscar-worth performance), but I can't imagine what financial difficulties made C Lambert to appear in this laughable piece of garbage (the first Fortress was OK, I remember I saw it ca. 5 years ago). The actors are not acting, but fooling around, both bad and good characters are so poorly drawn that you don't care at all whether they live or die, the plot is.... nonsense (it's the mildest word).In short, if you had patience to sit through this movie on your coach, it's because you watched it on fast forward...Actually I'd beg you NOT TO BUY this ""movie"" to somehow discourage actors and producers to participate in such rubbish."
2,Fortress 2,"As Fortress was an excellent film I was very disappointed with this sequel. The first one had nice ideas not in a realistic setting but in a nice way. This was just repeated and overdone in the second part so that it became ridiculous, e.g. fighting in outer space for hour without oxygen and in jeans? So I recommend the first part but forget this."
2,Misleading,"I ordered this because I thought I was getting two of these, like the picture shows. They retail for 20 bucks, so the higher price made me think that also. What I got was ONE of these - for too high a price. One of my two kids was very dissapointed. Thanks.Oh, and when we tried to fill it - nothing. The water just leaks out the back of the head. This one must be defective, as weve had others in the past that worked. They really had fun with the ones that worked, hence the 5 stars for fun. But with this deal I paid 30 bucks (plus 4 for S&H;) for ONE defective worm, and wound up with TWO bummed out kids."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book as with most books about J P Getty because it failed to talk about his home life in any detail. In particular, it failed to mention how he treated his wives, children, and grandchildren; how he refused to pay the ransom for one even though he knew about his whereabouts. It basically glossed over everyone he left behind, including his grandson William Paul Getty who celebrated his birthday one day after J P Getty's death.--Gummi Bear"
3,Not as good as the cups,"I bought these ones, because it was the only one I could find big enough and in chocolate to match my furniture. They are not as ""sticky"" to the floor as the kind I got for the bed wheels , but it will at least keep the legs of my couch from scratching up the hardwood. The couch slides even without ""tipping"" like it seems these are designed to do. I have a very long and heavy couch, so there is no ""tipping"" involved when I move it."
3,Gold but Not Golden,"For many a mainlander, Don Ho will always be the voice of Hawaii, and tunes like ""Tiny Bubbles"" and ""Hawaiian Wedding Song"" will forever accompany many a backyard or roooftop tiki party.Unfortunately, by the time Ho recorded this collection he was a bit past his prime, and he sounds as though he's walking through the process of laying these tracks down. It is grand having these mostly romantic tunes together in one place (especially ""Papas Memento,"" which seems to be The Desiderata recast in Hawaiian Pidgin English!), and the program is ideal for at-home celebrations in need of a bit of exotica. But for more exciting takes on these songs, seek out Ho's 1960s work with his backing group The Aliis."
4,Great classic Christmas music,"These are some great tunes from the past, when Christmas music was fun and inventive.Unfortunately, K-Earth is no longer playing these tunes. This year, they've switched to easy listening garbage like Air Supply, Kenny Loggins, and Mannheim Steamroller for Christmas songs. This is pretty odd, because the regular playlist is still all-oldies. Too bad. Call K-Earth to complain and get our great Christmas oldies back on the air!"
3,X-Men A-Okay!,"This is a pretty good gift pack except there are too many repeats. One can only have so many wolverine, beast and cambit in one's collection. On the plus side, if you are a avid customizer of ML stuff, you can certainly use the spare parts!"
5,Great introductory book!,"I bought this book for a cousin in her early teens. I taught her to knit, but she lives across the country and I'm not around to help with follow-up questions. She loves the projects and has started several of her friends knitting with it too!"
3,I Wanted to Like it More....,"Every Clint Eastwood fan will grin at the witty one-liners and sit on the edge of the seat for the mountain climbing sequences - very thrilling.But the plot, acting, and the tempo of the film fall short of the high quality of Eastwood's best work.This will kill a couple of hours on an airplane or in a terminal but won't remain long in the mind as a memorable film or performance. Thank goodness he went on to act and direct bigger and much better films."
2,"Ok, if you are a Clint fan","Truth is: I've bought this DVD as a gift for my boyfriend, because he's a Clint fan...The movie in my opinion is laughable and outdated... If you like breathtaking views and a not-so-good plot, go ahead and indulge."
2,Hemlock,"Now did he throw six snowballs or was it only five? To tell you the truth, I kinda lost track myself in all this boredom.Hemlock? Leave it out. Whose called Hemlock? Do I look like a Hemlock? Yeah, more like Jack Crabsbelow. How many people have surnames that fit their chosen profession? George W Blunder. Pamela Airhead? Actually, I do recall a dog-catcher named Jackie Russel. Bang goes another smartypants review."
4,DVD- The Eiger Sanction,"If you like Clint, you'll like this movie. The dvd itself I received smelled a bit smokey (like it was in a warehouse fire) but looked and played fine."
3,addicted to it,"I remembered seeing the film and that I probably liked it.I am 66 and desperate for entertainment.It has probably never been shown on telvison because it would need too much editing.I love it now, watched it 12 times until my vcrwore out so I got another copy. i also got another vcr."
5,Classic and awesome movie!,"You can never go wrong with Clint Eastwood! I love this movie, the espionage story and the European scenes. Many people don't know that Clint Eastwood performed his own stunts in this movie since he was a real Mountain climber and assumed all high risk shots for the movie!! Highly recommended and the supporting actors including Keneddy are all aces!"
3,Clin'ts Rough Draft Thriller,"""The Eigar Sanction"" felt like a rough draft of a Clint Eastwood thriller. Eastwood stars and directs in this action adventure as a former hit-man summoned out of a self-imposed retirement to assassinate an enemy spy.The film was released in 1975, and Clint is a bit cheesy in this role, plus it reminded me vaguely of a copycat James Bond movie. There were plenty of beautiful women, some dangerous, but most as ""frosting on the cake"" roles. At any rate the final scenes were interesting as Eastwood is told to figure out who in the mountain-climbing party he needs to assassinate. The four men try to climb the treacherous Eiger Mountain as bad weather sets in.Overall, the movie is interesting to watch a young Clint Eastwood get his footing as a star and director. Also starring are Vonetta McGee, George Kennedy and Jack Cassidy."
1,Poor quality DVD,This is one of my all time favorite movies but the picture quality on this particular DVD from Amazon is horrible - dark and grainy. I wish I had returned it when I had a chance. What a terrible thing to do to such a good movie!
3,This is an assassination film in more ways than one...,"Though this is, indeed, an Eastwood film, it is, uncharacteristically for Eastwiood, based on a book. The book is, of course, far, far better than the film, but for a quirky, off-beat bit of casting against type, this is a nice bit of fluff. The book wasn't, of course, but as Eastwood seems to have found it impossible to transmit very much of the book's richness of narrative and subtext onto the screen, what can one expect? The best scene is when Eastwood says, ""Freytag! You aaaaaaaaaasshoooooole!"""
4,Great Action Movie Even Though Dated,"This is one of those movies you can enjoy if you just let go and let the movie play out. The action keeps moving and the scenery is often strikingly dramatic and beautiful. Clint Eastwood plays the part of Dr. Jonathan Hemlock, an irresistibly handsome art history professor who finances a personal art collection by working as an assassin for a government bureau and for whom all of the women fall head over heels. The villains are suitably villainous and the Clint Eastwood character deals with them forcefully and firmly.This is a favorite oldie which still has a lot to offer the action movie fan. At two hours and eight minutes running time it takes the major part of an evening to watch, but it is fun to watch and I recommend it to the action movie fan."
5,Spectacular !,"Someone loaned me this book a couple of years ago......but the movie was not so easy to find.I loved the book - and I am no sucker for Spy Novels - so I was leary of the movie...they always disappoint.NOT THIS TIME.Eastwood was 47 when he made this movie - he plays a 35 year old, and has biceps (and all out body) to die for !The characters and settings are authentic. And the scenery is Truly Spectacular !Eastwood did a lot of research to prepare for this climb. And the research pays off.I love that there is 70s style fashion, and very little swearing -Who needs swear words ? We get the idea when George Kennedy says ""screw that"" or someone else says ""Friggin"" We get it !Best of all I rented this movie on my FIRE for $2.99 - the panavision fit perfectly and the definition rendered amazing visuals.If you every doubted Eastwood as a direector - watch this film.I highly recommend both the book AND the FIRE version of the movie.. can't say enough about either. ENJOY !"
4,The Eiger Sanction Holds Up,"Clint Eastwood's ""The Eiger Sanction"" was made in 1975 and was, at that time, an excellent action thriller. Viewing it again recently, I was surprised at how well it has held up. This is due mostly to the location shoots - filmed in Monument Valley and in the Swiss Alps instead of on a Hollywood soundstage. These guys really went up there and filmed those climbing sequences for real (including star and director Eastwood, who was about 45 at the time), and that just can't be faked. The spy story is also pretty good, there is an excellent supporting performance by Jack Cassidy, and Vonetta McGee and George Kennedy lend solid support. Also, John Williams' pre-Star Wars score is hauntingly jazzy and suspenseful. Check this one out."
3,not widescreen!,"When I think widescreen, I think it will fill up my hdtv screen fully. Other dvd's that are widescreen do that.It was a very good movie, with great scenery although the it was a little ridiculous the head guy having an eye problem that made it necessary for himto live in a special low light environment."
4,Eiger Sanction - Worth Watching for Eastwood's Climbing Scenes,"Several movies about mountain climbing/rock climbing have been made over the years; the Eiger Sanction is probably the best as far as realistic climbing scenes go. The movie is older (1975) and suffers from some cheesy script at times, but there's enough classic Eastwood dialogue interspersed to make it worthwhile. I was intrigued to learn that Clint Eastwood took rock climbing lessons and actually did all the scenes himself--these alone make the film worth watching."
4,"Nice ring, stone is a bit darker then the photo","This is a nice ring. The stone is darker in color then what showed on my monitor. The previous reviewer mentioned pink stones that look yellow - this is my first piece with a pink stone and I would say it is a true ""pink"" that if anything leans towards purple in color. The quality is high and the stone sparkles."
1,"New bottle, tint, and perfume","I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price. It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless. When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product. I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula."
5,same Suave clarifying that is no longer sold in my drugstore,This is the same clarifying shampoo that my drugstore no longer carries. The sellers sent it promptly and made the experience hassle free. The seller was called Odzo or something like that. Glad you had it.They no longer carry Pantene clarifying shampoo either. I think the Suave is a little easier on the scalp.
1,Inferior to previous product,"I used Suave Shampoo for Oily Hair for years and felt it was the best product on the market. Suave has dropped that product in favor of the Daily Clarifying Shampoo for Dry to Oily Hair. I have used two bottles of the new formulation and determined that a ""one size fits all"" approach to shampoo is destined to fail when it comes to handling oily hair. Despite washing my hair daily (as I always have), this new formulation fails to get me through 16 hours before my hair is a stringy, oily mess. This new and improved product is a failure."
1,Wrong shampoo,"You sent me the wrong shampoo. You sent the Naturals shampoo come on Amazon, get with it. All my orders lately have problems."
1,doesn't provide help for oily scalp,"I tried this product since it was so cheap, but didn't like it. 1. It doesn't foam up/lather much, so its hard to get it worked into your hair/scalp. 2. After one day, you will see oil building up again. I didn't notice much of a change in oil, and I've tried alot better products out that that will keep oil away for much longer."
5,Amazing book for anyone who wants to truly control their lives.,"This book is the most realistic, useful thing ever written if you want to control yourself and exercise self discipline."
1,More pointless film theory puke,"You can't follow the thread of Catherine Russell's argument; you can only pretend to, whether you're posturing for stuck-up film theory boyz or forced to ""identify the central concepts"" in film class. Just read one of her sentences, and then ask yourself, ""What is she trying to say?"" I'll start you off: ""Viola's use of video is informed by an existentialist theory of medium specificity. His treatment of possession is thus ontological and in many ways a more successful version of the 'cine-transe' imagined by Rouch"" (234). Over 300 pages of such absurd drivel make this book unreadable. Don't read it passively--question every word, every invented phrase, every name she drops. Her goal is to sound creative and learned (""the cartography of modern culture"" *is* a neat phrase), but are we really impressed? No. Well-written books give you plenty of ideas for your time. This crazy offal just gives you one: film theory is utterly pointless."
3,some good ideas,"There are some good ideas proposed in this book. Number symbolism (the degree that a planet is in tells something about the age that this planet will work), the asteroids and harmonics to sum up some. But I find that mingling all the mentioned systems is wrong. The author finds relevant events in one's life by using the asteroids, minor aspects, etc. This way one can prove anything! This is not a good system if you want to predict. You should read the book but you will not learn what is really important in a natal chart."
1,temperature range mistated,I bought this product for 35$ more than the other options at amazon because the product description carried a range of temperatures of -40 to 700F. This is a mistake. The range on the packaging states clearly -30 to 500F. I guess I can make due but I would have bought the more inexpensive option had I known. Argg!!
5,This is a very nice tool for spot checks,"As an equipment troubleshooter, this tool comes in handy to see where power is heating up, where a bad bearing is, comparison checks. It is simple and straight forward to use. No bells or whistles - just point it and you get the Temp. There is a switch by the battery (easy to replace) that lets you select Centigrade or Fahrenheit. Easy to read the window and it fits right in my toolpouch next to my screwdrivers."
5,T2 fluke meter,"Great product, fair price and super fast shipping. This is a quality meter and I would recommend it to anyone needing temperature control accuracy."
5,Very good value.,"Great item. As owner/manager of rental properties, we use this tool often. We use it to check the surface temp of anything from interior walls, floors, stove tops, water, to intake and discharge air coming out of our air ducts and into our return ducts. We find it to be accurate and fast, which saves us time and time is money. It has paid for itself many, many times over. Good product and a good price, what more could you want."
1,Prudent buyer,"I thought with a name like ""fluke"" known for their quality electrical testers and with all the glowing reviews, this would be a great infrared thermometer tester. Well I came to find out it's made in China, which I can deal with as long as it's quality(which usually it's not) I tested it on numerous surfaces, it had a range of 75 degrees to 95 degrees for most things. Snow was 89 degrees, boiling water was 92 degrees. I can deal with a few degrees off but this was unexceptable. I returned this item"
2,Bad spesification,in the product specification it write that wide temperature range from -40C to 760C (-40 F to 1400 F) and in the fluke spefification that is in the product it writes that the range is -30 to 500 degree celcius.
5,Fluke Infra red temp gun,"I am very pleased with buying things on Amazom, the service is very good and I have never had any problems with them. I RATE Amazon as one of the best places to shop for nearly anything. Now for the Fluke temp infrared gun, I rate it very high. Most anything by Fluke is of very high quality. Ron W."
2,Great Chinese IR Thermometer,"An easy to hold Chinese designed infrared laser therometer, with both spot and scan functions, and a steady beam. A nice hand held unit, although x2 overpriced.Accuracy is unpredictable, and usually 1 to 1.5 degrees F. lower than a mercury minimum-maximum therometer.Easy to replace through such U.S. distributors as Fluke."
4,Temperature range is wrong in description.,"Looks like a good product & I've used Fluke instruments at the laboratories where I work. But an important note is the measurement range is approximately -32F to +500F, which is comparable to the other devices. The Fluke tech support substantiated those numbers.....just so you know."
2,Accuracy specification not what is advertised,"I bought the Fluke because it advertised a ""best in class accuracy of 1% of reading"", so I was expecting for example +/-0.75 deg F of accuracy at a 75 deg F reading. The documentation that comes with it spells out the actual details of 1% or 2 deg F, whichever is greater, so the accuracy is really no better than other brands that were less expensive. I was duped by the false claims, and paid double over other brands that would have been just as good. I'll probably keep it just because it is not worth the hassle of returning it and getting another one."
5,Fluke 62 Mini Infrared Thermometer,"It is a Fluke!!what else do I need to say about it?it reads in C and F, and a MAX.come with a energize 9 volt battery, quality!"
5,Great Item that Works Great,"I had purchased an inexpensive IR thermometer before I got this one, and was very unhappy with it, as it was inaccurate and inconsistent. I decided to get the best so I got the Fluke 62 Mini a month ago from Amazon. I am very pleased with the performance of this product. I have compared it with thermometers and aimed it next to them, and the readings are accurate and very consistent between the same repeated uses. It feels well made and comes with the 9-volt battery needed for operation, and a carrying case with a belt loop. I would recommend this item to anyone that wants a good IR thermometer and a relatively inexpensive price for what you get."
2,Get the heavy duty version,"I installed this at my apartment complex. It as ripped up withing a few days. Also, relatively thin strands don't really provide a satisfying ""nothing but net"" experience. Get the heavy duty model with thicker strands. More durable and more enjoyable.Spalding Heavy Duty Red White and Blue Net"
1,More like hair net,Not a good quality net at all. Cheap price and cheap net. May be best to get one at the local store where you can put your hands on it before buying it. Try Walmart for this item.
5,Awesome,This net is awesome!!!!! I love the red white and blue colors every time I get a swish the net goes up
1,Wasted Days and Wasted Nights. . .,"I'm no Biblical scholar but I love the Anchor series and particularly wanted to read a scholarly edition of the Book of Acts. I realize Mr. Munck was ill while he worked on this and died prior to completion but, frankly, this should never have been published. I can't imagine a more conservative edition: the notes are worthless, nothing more than a straightforward repetition of what we've already read in the text and the commentaries add NOTHING to understanding. I paid top dollar for a HC edition of this, not realizing it had been superceded by (what I assume to be) a superior edition. I may or may not spring for that one. AVOID like pestilence."
5,This Book Delivers....,"lots of laughs. Fantasy pen and ink cartoons of what life is like from Eggbert's point of view in his mother's uterus. Nothing is sacred in this book. Children of all ages will get ""a kick"" out of it. WARNING: You'll laugh until you cry. If you are pregnant, please visit the bathroom prior to reading this book!"
5,Gotta love Mr. Campi,This is an energetic album with more than a few rockabilly gems. It is a bargain on Amazon too. If you like real rock and roll you oughta get it.
5,Best modern history of ancient and medieval India,"Romila Thapar has updated her classic history of ancient India, and extended the story down to 1300 AD. The early version was the best balanced study of the period. The updating takes account of developments in scholarship, in history and archaeology, over the last 35 years. The result is a magisterial work, that may not please everyone, but will certainly provide food for thought for any intelligent person.Read this book. India is a great country, and this will explain to you, better than any other (I have read literally dozens), without sugarcoating or dumbing down, what have been the enduring issues down the ages, and that still drive, at times inflame, at others divide, but more often unite, Indian society."
3,"Gives valuable insight , but book has a tone of bias","Book highlights many interesting aspects of Ancient Indian History, Let take these :I never knew that Trade played such a key factor in Ancient India, growth of Sanskrit with Panini's grammer and the official acceptance.'Ancient India' paints a nice detailed picture of ancient India.Reason for it not getting 5 stars: Tone , authour finds it difficult to seperate her liberal world view from the history she seeks to write.Read it for the facts , disregard the bias"
2,not a good book,"Im afraid, Romilas out of date, marxist views of India are not in line with current scholarly thinking, in light of many recent archaeological findings.Tharpar is nothing more than the product of the British education system, that continues to perpetuates much of the coloniast attitudes on the roots of Civilisation in India.Books from Subhash Kak, David Frawley, Francois Gautier, Stephen Knapp really get to the heart of soul of India's history.India's history is much older than anyone dares to think."
1,Does not highlight the right points,"I purchased this book keeping in mind the depth of knowledge of Romila Thapar, but was extremely DISSAPOINTED. The book completely underlights the Golden Period of India 800BC to 800AD and leaves off details like the discomfiture of Alexander (the Great :-0 ) and many other really fantastic details that could have been included. There is not much historic or literary value for this book. Not th e right buy for studying the history of India."
3,Good..but not very professional,"I really liked the section on archeology and scientific methods in the begining of the book. But as I read on...I could not find any correlation between the conclusions drawn and the archeological evidence or methods that was discussed earlier in the book. If the author intended to, it did not clearly stand out in the book.I am sure I would have to provide more references for my graduate thesis than this book provides for some of the major statements it makes.Its like talking about gravitation as philosophy and not science.Overall, a good book if you want to reinforce what you already probably know (or don't know) about early Indian History. But very unprofessional, given this reads like a fictonal novel and not like a history book.Still looking for a good history book on India which stands on the weight of the Author's extensve research and object analysis of scientifically plausible sources."
4,Incredible book but tough reading,"If you want to know a lot of technical information about the German rocket program in World War II this is the place to start. Neufeld has a grasp of the technical side of the program like no other historian, however his writing style leaves much to be desired. A good plus of the book is that he includes diagrams of the missles as well as a couple sections of pictures that give the reader an idea what the things and places he writes about look like. I found being able to visualize certain things makes understanding it much easier. He also includes an appendix with a chronology of the German rocket program that readers will find helpful for quick short references to each successive rocket in the program. Overall this is an excellent book, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only due to Neufeld's writing style which makes this book tough going in some sections that include lots of boring, and in my opinion, overkill, technical detail."
3,too much focus on organisational matters,"Obviously, the book stresses more the organisational issues (which can be cumbersome) than the technical details of the V2 project. An organigram of the ordnance/ministry/SS would have been helpful, as well as a map of the various sites. Not many technical details, especially on the Wasserfall project (I am not sure I understand by which mean the missile were to hit a plane...). Subjects are not always presented according to their chronological order. No detailed information on the actual devastations caused by the rockets (where, how many, hit rate). Otherwise, it seems that the information is pretty accurate."
4,sweet,"I remember when I was 8 years old and I would stay awake until like midnight so I could watch Voltron on toonami(SP) then one week it wasn't there anymore, somthing else was on, like dragoball Z or some rubbish that i personally had no interest in but i think it is wonderful that its coming outon dvd :) it makes my day. more or less lol"
3,Most important things ignored!,"I already have a disapointment with this new 2007 Voltron's DVD series. They removed all deaths, kicks in the nuts(by the princess), bloodsheds and then repeat scenes of people running to fill up the space. In the special features they show you the scenes (not the whole chapter) with a big CENOSRED square...so you never get to see the scenes as we did when kids.Another deal is the dialog. Many female voices are men pretending to be women, why not replace those lines with real ladies? Want to make it better?..thats the way to improve things the right way..my though.Anything else, not bad at all(special features). By the way, DO NOT spect the same chapter order, just in case."
4,Voltron-Defender of the Universe-Collection One: Blue Lion,Love it! Old school cartoons are the best. It's great to have all the episodes in consecutive order to see the development of Voltron.
4,Somewhat Disapointed,"I love Voltron and have been waiting for years for them to be released on DVD. While the packaging and everything is great, there is one big thing missing that is still listed as being part of the set (at least it's still listed on Amazon)...the option of watching it in Japanese. I've been trying forever to find the original Japanese copies of Voltron and was more than excited to find out that the DVD sets would have them. Was quite disappointed when upon opening them, they're English only. Normally I'd give this 5 stars but the lack of the original Japanese knocks it down a star, especially as its still listed as having it."
1,Bored,I remember loving Voltron as a kid. So when I saw this I jumped at the chance to watch it. I didn't even finish the first episode as I was so bored. I love the animation style but the story and acting were just flat and uninspiring.For die hard fans only.
1,Raw Deal,"This was a bum deal. I had spent hours finding the DVD's I would purchase for my summer shopping. Then I was directed to something ""new"" (Amazon's online DVD service). I happily made my purchases and was all set to show my kids some nostalgic video. The day that I clicked ""play"" I get a ""your out-of-country status disqualifies you from watching the video you have purchased"".I usually read the Agreement plans carefully. Even when in a hurry, I usually read the BOLD print. So how did this one slip by?I resent Amazon for not adequately notifying me that my purchase would not be delivered."
2,Not as cool as I remember,"I was so excited to see Voltron coming to DVD. It was far and away my favorite show as a kid back in the 80's and I couldn't wait to see them again. Unfortunatly the novelty wore off before the first episode was even over. I know its a kids show but the voice acting is horribly annoying, they re-use the same animation sequences over and over, and the plot, well, its ahh...really ...really ...stupid. Advise to rent disk one before buying the whole set(s). Make sure you still enjoy it as an adult. Oh yeah, Thundercats is the same story, not as cool as you remember."
5,Voltron a true hero.,"I have been a very big fan of the voltron series and still am, When I first heard the series was coming out on DVD I was very happy. I am very happy that I bought the series on DVD."
4,Great birthday gift,I bought this item for my 11 yr. son who is a big fan of the 80's anime shows. The fact this one came in a collector's tin that was mint made it even better. He now wants them all. Thank you.
1,PRODUCT NOT WHAT SHOWN!,"I already had the basic version of the first set. (blue lionI bought all the rest of the collection in the tins. I decited to upgrade my blue lion to the tin set. The description said bonus features and more. I know what is in the other tins THAT IS NOT WHAT CAME. I got the exact same boring dvds BUT put in a tin. No thank you, I wanted the extras....interviews and such! Not very happy."
1,Not what I remembered it to be,"I thought it would be better than it turned out to be -- It is hard to believe that it was a popular show for kids in the 1980 cause it is among the worst put together cartoon almost ever. But it is better to buy it via Instant Amazon than to actually pay for dvds that have to be tossed away.Too bad they don't carry the Battle of the Planets -- much better done, though still tacky. Or better still - Robotech."
3,Wow...much different then when I was a kid!,When I was a child I thought this was a great cartoon. Now 20+ years later I felt that I was jipped. Don't get me wrong...still a great cartoon but now I want the original Japanese uncut version :)
5,Husband and son love it,My husband watched this show as a kid and now has my son hooked to it. They sit together and watch it then talk about the characters! Boys love it!
2,Beware...there are two versions!,the first edition version...the metal tin is embossed..and the inside is a digipak foldout that has the 3 discs and includes a booklet episode guide.the 2nd edition...which is what they are selling now..the metal tin is not embossed and the 3dvds come in a regular dvd case and does not include the booklet episode guide...instead it has a booklet advertising other dvds!i suggest you look for the 1st edition.EDIT:i just recieved the 1st edition.. video looks very nice...but about the audio..the 2.0 sounds very meh...i suggest you watch the episodes in 5.1 makes it so much better!i wish the default audio was 5.1 because its a hassle having to choose 5.1 everytime i watch it :P
2,Not exactly what I expected,"When the Voltron Collection One arrived it was not the same edition as I expected. Even though the Collector tin was part of this purchase the Collectors Edition was not inside. A Second edition release was inside and not the fold out collector's edition.Even though this was the series I wanted, it is not the edition I was expecting to receive."
4,2004 Chevy Avalanche,Bought this pipe to go with a Walker 21423 Quiet-FlowSS Muffler and tail pipe. Everything fit well and installed easily. It's not mandrel bent other wise it would have gotten 5 stars. It was a very good price for an OE replacement exhaust.
5,One of the best I have ever heard! Buy it now!,"In all my years of being involved with the tejano music industry, not just as a fan but as a direct supporter... This album is the best by far that I have listened to in a long time. From David Lee Garza to The Desperado's. The music just makes you want to get out of your seat and dance. Some of the conjunto's are just uplifting. Get this CD and make sure you add it to your collection. Manny B! Music Productions..."
1,Do not use!,"This book provides horrible code examples, the author does not explain the syntax of code at nearly the empirical level required for a novice web developer. He omits blocks of code from larger program examples if he feels he has ""explained"" it already, which makes the larger code blocks even more difficult to comprehend given his lack of explanations. This book is not suitable as a tool to teach oneself from scratch."
1,Poor Javascript section,"I was given this book as part of a graduate IT course. As I had an excellent understanding of HTML already I skipped to the Javascript section and was sorely disappointed. As another reviewer has pointed out, there were several blatant errors in the code that were quite unbelievable. Surely the assignment operator (=) and the equality operator ( == or eq) should not get mixed up in a published book, yet in this case they were. I tried to read on but kept on encountering poor editing and what seemed to be a lack of understanding on part of the author. Needless to say I quit the course and bought the Definite Guide to Javascript."
1,Dont Bother!!! (-10 star),"Being a student of Bates I can vouch that his java abilities are underwhelming at most. It comes as no surprise that other reviewers have found his java code inadequate, badly commented, but mostly just wrong.As my teacher of java (at University) all of the above points are manifested in his unworkable tutorial code. In short his inability and blatant disinterest in teaching are echoed throughout the book (and my university course).I am sure he has made a quick $buck through the sale of this book as a staple coding reference for many of the U.K. Universities and colleges (where his friends work - standard lecturer swindling technique!!), albeit at the expense of students education.My advice for any java/java applet code references is to look for SUNSOFT PRESS books (real-SUN), as they are fairly easy to follow"
1,A severe dissapointment,"This series can be divided up into two parts, both on entirely different ends of the quality spectrum. I got the Many Colored Land and the Golden Torc in a two-volume hard cover edition for 25 cents at a garage sale. After reading and finding that they were two of the best fantasy/sci-fi books I had read I decided to buy the next two. These were the worst dissapointments I have ever had with any series. Usually if the first few books in a series are spectacular at least the next ones are decent and readable. These were neither. I found myself putting down The Non Born King half way through and reading the prologue of the next one to see if I had missed anything interesting. I hadn't. And the next one was just as bad if not worse. At least I can read the first two again"
4,Interesting Novel,"I liked this book a lot. I put off reading anything else until I finished this series. My only singular complaint is the order in which they were published in relation to the Galactic Milieu. I made the mistake of reading Jack the Bodiless a couple of years ago and subsequenlty forgot the tittle and author. I then read the Saga of the Pliocence Exile on the prompting of a friend. I found myself vaugely remembering the name Marc Remillard. It took me weeks to figure out what this was all about, and by then I had finished the Pliocene Exile without realizing it might have been easier just to have read Galatic Mileu first so I could figure out what was up with Marc. I just satrted re-reading Jack the Bodiless and plan to then read the Pliocene exile again so I can sort it all out. It is much easier to read them in order of the events taking place than the order of the publication date."
3,dissapointing,"My mom brought this for me for making the honor roll. Well I would like to advise you not to buy this product. My mom been wandering how something could rise without getting heated. The food rises but it taste so bad my mom had to read to see if the food was edible, (it is). The food is also rubbery and after it rises when you take it out it feel smooth and similar to play dough. It taste like it too. (Yeah when I was small I taste play dough.) I would advise not to try this but buy the Easy bake real meal oven now that food is sooooooooooooooooo good!"
1,That can not be food.....,"I bought this for my 4 yr old. I hid it from her after the second time she used it. I have no idea what is in those mixes, but it is the most foul tasting thing I've ever had. My daughter and I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and I've put up with some of her nasty tasting experiments for the sake of her self-esteem. There was no disguising my distate as I was running for the bin. The utensils/pans are worth keeping to play with, but I would suggest you find other uses for the food. P.S. The dog will NOT eat them."
5,A GREAT TOY!,"This baking kit was the best kit I have ever bought! I have bought many other kits where I had to cook it under a light. It was a big pain, and the stuff never cooked right. With this baking kit it rises instantly. Just add water. It is very durable and fun. There are also a lot of things to make and decorate. I give this item five stars!"
2,"Fun mixing, gross eating...","My 4-year old daughter got this as a Christmas present from her aunt last year. I thought that it would be a nice alternative to the Easy Bake Oven. Now, I wish I had suggested to her aunt to get the Easy Bake Oven! My daughter always helps me in the kitchen, mixing things up, pouring things in, etc. The mixing part of this was good for her; she thoroughly enjoyed that part. But then she wanted me to try a bite of the chocolate cake that she just ""baked"" and the taste and texture has left a permanent scar on my taste buds!! And that was Christmas of 2003! If your child likes to mix and stir and pretend to bake, it's fine. Just don't eat the final product!"
1,Do not buy this off brand product!,We bought this product thinking it would be just like the easy bake products. All of the products tasted like rubber. My daughter wouldn't make any more. She did like the utensils that came with it.
4,Really easy for moms,I like this toy. And my son loves it. The only problem is I can't find any refills anywhere in the Los Angeles area. I am able to buy from Roseart. The problem is that I have to buy a case at $42 and there is a $100 minimum order. I explained this to Roseart customer service and all they do is keep telling me where to buy even though these stores don't sell the refills.
2,Tottal dissapointment!,"For christmas me and my two sisters each recived a instant bake fun center. When we used the instant bake we thought Santa hated us. The dough does NOT rise, everything tastes like mush, and it makes a big mess.The tray to mold the dough is very very small. Everything was tiny. Durabillity is great. It is not cheap plastic, it is actually very tough. Although it is very hard to get the treats out. We were very dissapointed, it is defenately not worth wasting money on."
1,It's not National Geographic,"Please don't waste your time with this movie. It has little story, minimal scenery and average directing. I watched the final third of the movie on fast-fwd, it was that bad. For heavens sake, don't ""buy it"" if you do decide to give it a go."
3,"Great Cinematography, Little Plot","This movie was a true story. It is the story of an Italian woman, played by Kim Bassinger, who with her husband, buys a large ranch in Kenya. Unfortunanately, not everyones life is interesting enough to make a movie about it. I wish director, Hugh Hudson, would have based it on a true story that way he could have added some exciting storyline and made this film a little more interesting.Just when the movie looks like it might start getting interesting with an exciting event such a storm, the husband getting gored by a wild animal, or a possible conflict with local natives whoare poaching animals for ivory, the event ends and the story goes onto something totally unrelated.Another big complaint that I had with the movie was that a big point was made over the fact that thehusband had put something in an egg that hung over the couples bed...The cinematography was outstanding but the plot was to weak to make me want to purchase this film."
2,comes up empty-handed,"Vincent Perez was quite good in this movie and adds some much needed spark. I would like to see him in more movies. But unlike the reviewer who calls Kim Bassinger's acting ""amazing astonishing"" I think she is one of the worst actresses around and in this movie she is no less irritating. I did however appreciate her realistic portrayal with her son Emmanuel.There is very little depth to this movie, it skims over a lot of potentially interesting plots/sub-plots but doesn't go anywhere! Which is too bad because I think Kuki must be a deep and interesting person.As many others have said ""for heavens sake .. don't buy it"""
4,I dreamed of Africa review,"The movie has an inspirational tone and it tells a good story. Kuki Gallmann is a model for those of us who love Africa. She succeeded despite having to pay a very high price. And she never gave up on her dream. She did not run after Kenya claimed the life of her husband and son. When watching the movie, I sincerely realized, one more time, how lucky I really am.Moreover, the movie raises awareness with respect to some of the pressing current events and challenges the Kenyan state faces: violence, poaching and lack of personal safety.To read the whole review please visit:http://codrinarsene.com/2009/05/i-dreamed-of-africa/"
2,Two stars for scenery,"No story, no directing, and no acting. thank God I didn't buy this one. Sudami"
2,"Better than the book, but not all that good","With the annoying elements of the book reduced or removed, ""I Dreamed of Africa"" becomes an okay movie. Mostly this is the story of an Italian woman who, with her husband, buys a large ranch in Kenya. I won't give anything away, but she endures various tragedies which provide the movie's drama. The performances are good, the scenery is pretty, there isn't mush emphasis on plot. The ""Africa"" in the title is mostly scenery. Not near as good as ""Out of Africa"". ""Nowhere in Africa"" is the best film in the European-in-East-Africa genre."
1,Depressing with no consistent storyline,"There's really no way that they could make this movie any better. Seeing as it's based on a true story, I don't think there's any fixing it. It tries to paint a picture of Kim Basinger's character losing everything but still having a respect for Africa, and tries to put this woman's luxurious turned hard life into a very dramatic light, but ultimately fails. And there's not and real storyline or climax in the whole film, it's more like you're watching somebody's life, and nearly only the bad parts. It would have been better as a documentary, I think, rather than a major motion picture. You're left feeling depressed, and sad that you took the time to watch it. Skip it."
3,I dreamed of Kuki's Africa-so I went,"I did volunteer work at Ol Ari Nyrio in 11/07 and it was the most amazing experience of my life. It was amazing to see where the movie was filmed. Africa is not a constant National Geographic film, and it is a beautiful as it is dangerous, as lulling as it is exciting. Although I did not think Kuki's character as well portrayed by the character in this film, I found her story well portrayed - truth is always more interesting & stranger than fiction, remember. Kuki is an amazing person and the work she has done for the people & animals in the area, without spoiling the natural habitat or trying to change the people's ways, is well told. The death of her son and husband, so tragic, has led her to different levels in life, where so much work has been done for the good of generations to come-I wish the film could have covered this but know that would not be possible. Read her books-they are wonderful!"
4,Unexpectedly Great!,"What a brilliant performance by Kim Basinger, without her this movie had nothing but beautiful scenery. Her Oscar worthy performance allows you to feel her ups and downs throughout this true, very dramatic story."
5,Great portrayal of Kuki Gallmann's early experiences in Africa,"First of all, the dingbat that wrote the editorial review should know that the film was NOT based on South Africa it is based on Kenya, and that they are two different countries.Second, it is based on the autobiographical novel of Gallmann's life and the movie shows how Africa is a country of contrasts: beauty, instability, greed, brutal forces of nature, etc. How much you get out of the film is based on how much knowledge you have of Kenya and life in Africa.But even if you just take it at face value, it really is a beautiful portrayal of her life, very poignant and heart-wrenching at times. In other words, this movie will make you feel and is definitely worth watching.I give it five stars because I am familiar with the novel and know that it stays very true to the story that really happened."
4,DVD I dreamed of Africa,"This is a beautiful film. I wish I knew which parts were filmed in Kenya and which in South Africa. I intend to visit the place in SA , so I was really looking forward to watch it. The story is OK but the scenery is most worth watching!"
4,Beautiful movie...,"With beautiful footage in both Italy and Africa, this movie makes for a great ""couch vacation""..."
5,"Good moving, very moving.","I purchased this movie at a recommendation from my sister. Not being a Kim Basinger fan, I must admit that this movie is by-far one of the best performances of her career (my opinion). It was a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good drama."
2,Overpriced Drivel,"Kim Basinger is impossibly beautiful, and she is even more beautiful at 47 in this film than she was 20 years ago. The film is unfortunately a pointless, poorly-directed mess. It is a shallow rip-off of ""Out of Africa"" (yes, I know it's a true story) and about the only accurate thing about it is the lawlessness and inhumanity of the native African poachers. The scenery is beautiful, but at about $27.00, this is really overpriced, even if you do get to look at Kim Basinger through most of the movie."
3,Wasn't as good as Out of Africa,Just returned from Africa this movie set was were we stayed. After watching Out of Africa this wasn't as interesting.The used movie was in good condition and I will watch it again.
2,"Nice looking, but the lens is hard to remove without breaking it","The mount method for the plastic lens that covers the fixture and bulbs is primitive. I could not remove it without breaking it. The supplier got me a replacement lens quickly, but it will probably break the next time I have to replace a bulb."
1,Kindle version by digireads.com is NOT worth it,"I bought this hoping that it would be a better translation than the free versions online. The reviews of this on the Kindle store were all about the catechism itself, so i bought it, and now wish I did not. There is no table of contents, which is terrible for someone who wants to use the catechism and go to different sections. The only way to go to a section is to guess its page number. This purchase wasn't a lot of money, but i'd rather not even have this version on my Kindle."
5,Luther's Large Catechism,This book is easy to read and understand. It is concise and practical for anyone seeking insight into Luther's teaching of God's Word. I highly recommend this book to those who are new to their faith in God or want to expand from the shorter catechism.
4,Great Book,Everyone must read this extraordinary piece of historical literature. I enjoyed this most compelling source to the inner thinkings of Luther.
2,Incomplete reference,"I am a Roman Catholic who is looking for precisely what Martin Luther's doctrines are. Upon asking an Evangelical Lutheran for a resource to study such doctrines, I was told to consult this book. After reading it cover to cover, clearly this book is intended for the instruction of children (as indicated by Martin Luther in these pages). If you are looking for the complete doctrines of Martin Luther, look elsewhere. For the record, I wish to familiarize myself with Luther's religion in order to convince others that the Protestant revolt resulted in many man-made religions that are diametrically opposed to the one true divinely instituted Church of our lord Jesus Christ."
4,Creepy cheese,"I thought this movie was pretty good, when I was 13. It has its campy elements, but the chick playing Evelyn was very convincing and scary.Sometimes a girl just needs to know when to back off a guy."
3,Early Clint Eastwood,He had a lot to learn about acting during his early carreer. The movie also really stretched to fill time.
4,cool film .... about stalking,"this is a interesting movie about a jazz radio dj and the woman who is stalking him in northern california circa 1971. It's a very well made thriller and clint could have easily made more great thrillers and even a giallo if he wanted to. He long ago proved that he is a top grade director. This was no exception. Clint does a average guy very well too who is not a bada**, the dvd looks ok but a good blu ray is needed for this thriller. This flick builds in suspense and remains a good film for fans of msytery and thrillers. Misty"" is of course a jazz song that is sexy for sure. I am waiting for a blu ray of this one."
4,Ahead Of Its Day With This Theme,"This was ""Fatal Attraction"" 16 years before that famous movie was made.The problem with this tense drama was credibility. There are several instances where just about everyone with a brain would avoid trouble by doing the sensible thing....except the character in here, of course! Also, being honest is the obvious thing to do here and, of course, that's not done either.Nevertheless, it's a taut thriller with Jessica Walter doing a great job playing a nutcase stalker ""Evelyn Draper."" I also enjoyed watching Donna Mills. An appealing actress, and not just because of a pretty face, I wonder she didn't do more films? After this movie, it's been almost all television roles for her.Clint Eastwood, the male lead here, has rarely been in a boring movie, and this is no exception."
4,Wears well,"I first saw this movie on release as a teenager, and thought it was a great scary movie. The main reason I bought it now was to get a hold of the great Jerry Mulligan soundtrack. The whole family have enjoyed the film now, and leaving out the 70's gear and hairstyles, its a great thriller."
3,Misty for more,"Worth viewing for Eastwood eye candy, and his bachelor pad aesthetics. Over the top but truly believable stalker drives the movie. Black stereotype too obvious. Great weekend afternoon movie."
4,Play Misty for me is a true Eastwood classic!,Great Jazz music and truly a tutorial on avoiding wacky women with long knives. This movie will give players nightmares for life but it is a true Eastwood classic that is entertaining and instructional at the same time.
5,Play Misty For Me,"I saw this movie back in the 70s and enjoyed it then, so bought it from Amazon.com now. It's still a great movie. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, you'd like it anyway, but the clothes, cars and general time period this was in is very enjoyable to me. Brought back lots of 70's memories.Good psycho flick. Jessica Walter is just as crazy as Glenn Close is in ""Fatal Attraction"", and just as believable."
4,The Original Fatal Attraction,"Done before Fatal Attraction and done better by Eastwood. Unfortunately, this film has not withstood the test of time as well as Fatal Atraction albeit the 70's slang, clothing, music, etc. Still, one feels much more sympathetic with Eastwood's character then Michael Douglas because he doesn't have a wife and child in tow. I remember seeing this when it first came out as well as another great film that Eastwood starred in: The Beguiled. Play Misty for Me is a great thriller for a Saturday evening. Check it out!"
5,Great Directorial Debut For Eastwood,"Play Misty For Me,starring Clint Eastwood,(also the first film he directed)is an excellent movie,and quite suspenseful at times.Eastwood plays a radio disc jockey named Dave Garver,who has a one night stand with the wrong woman,Evelyn Draper.(Jessica Walter)She turns psychotic when he doesn't want to take their relationship any further,and proceeds to make his life very miserable.I won't say any more about the plot.Eastwood is very good as Dave,as is Jessica Walter as Evelyn,and Donna Mills as Tobie,the woman Dave really wants to have a relationship with.The rest of the cast is good,too.The California locations were great and the music soundtrack was excellent.Overall,an excellent movie."
4,One of Clint's best!,"This is a great thriller! I totally love this movie. Clint Eastwood at his best! This is about a late night radio DJ who has a secret admirer. When he finally meets her, hoping for a one night stand, he finds an obsessive monster."
5,Good debut directorial!,"Play Misty meant the forst movie of this talented folm maker. This one is a tense psychological thriller which opened the inspiration sixteen years later to Fatal atraction, Jessica Walter (Nominated as best dramatic actress in 1971 for the Golden Globe), gives a surprisingly role as never before , as the outrageous lover who literally remains obsessed with Dave Garver (Clint)a nigttime disc jockey who loves the jazz and receives all kind of calls by phone.His affair is obviously unexpected , but it will lead to several bitter headaches and disturbing situation.Well thriller , and stills keeps its expressive force."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Clint's first film as a director and the forerunner to films like Fatal Attraction and Obsession, Play Misty For Me would be better if it cut the fat (I'm looking at you, pointless 10 minute long scene at a music festival); as it stands, it's a movie that has been done since and done better."
2,Training Film for DJs,"When I first got into broadcasting over 30 years ago I quickly learned about radio groupies, the DJ's ""biggest fans"" who call the request lines to tease and flirt with the DJ in that seductive, yet deceptive voice. Because a friend recommended that I must see this movie, I, fortunately, learned the easy way how not to fall into the trap many many DJs have gotten into and continue to get into. I have in turn have suggested the same to new, up and comming DJs to watch, learn and heed. Although this does a good job teaching rookie Djs a course in ethics, the film as a film kind of stinks that's why the two stars. Poor lighting and sound makes this a true B movie."
1,Play Misty for Me (1971) - Forget about it,"This movie was terrible. It may have been tolerable in it's time, but as a movie to watch today, it was a huge disappointment."
3,Still.... after all these years.,"A fabulous movie... a bit dated but, still filled with suspense. Loved the scenes of Monterey, Big Sur and Carmel."
1,Great Stalker/Thriller,"For the time period when this was made, this was an excellent movie. Made you stop and think, ""Watch who you're going to bed with""!"
4,reality today,"This movie released in the early 70's, has a story line still relevant today. I ordered this movie for my adult children to watch and see the comparison to the events they live in today. My daughter who watched it with us, compared it to someone in her life, and she is 25. With every event that happens, ""Play Misty"" causes an immediate reaction to whatever situation just happened, and agreement in the event.I like this movie, and is the reason I wanted it for the archives. Good movies are hard to find, and this one is classic."
5,Clint Plays The Victim...,"Yep, Clint Eastwood, DIRTY HARRY himself, is the victim in this movie! As strange as that may sound, it works! His radio DJ character, Dave Garver is still a macho sort of a guy, but he definitely has his hands full w/ Evelyn Draper (Jessica Walter). Evelyn isn't the type of gal who can be tossed aside after a one-night-stand. She is an ultra-needy, schizoid psychotic w/ a penchant for big, sharp knives! Dave tries to be nice. He attempts to give her the slip, resulting in Evelyn's total mental melt-down! PLAY MISTY FOR ME is a superb thriller w/ a terrific cast, including Donna Mills as Dave's girlfriend Tobie, and John Larch as an unfortunate police detective. Highly recommended to anyone who thinks their last relationship ended badly..."
4,Play Misty For Me,"Play Misty for MeA Good movie for an early 1970's suspense/thriller. By today's vstandards it would be considered ""sappy and predictable"". Clint Eastwood does a grat job playing a DJ in the early 1970's and Jessica Walter does a great job of playing an obseesed stalker.Good movie if you want to see Clint Eastwood play something other than a cop or cowboy."
5,Marvel at it's best,"I really like the Marvel action figures.It is just too bad that they don't make the 6"" line anymore.All the figures are nicely made. They are great for displaying around the desk because you can pose them anyway you like.A great set."
5,"great value, excelent set","first off the whole marvel legends line is possibly the best toyline ever, i feel nerdish being a 16 year old with a set of superhero figures in my room but they're just plain cool. I'm gonna skip strait to what you should know- if you're buying for a kid then make sure you know electra's bust is *ahem* there, it's not as bad as the angry parents put it but it's definately PG-13 stuff, and if you're big on ""No Violence"" then i first ask you why are you even looking at this?, secondly, that punisher has alot of ammo in ALL his incarnations, this included. as for everything else, the figures look great, are sturdy, and have more movement than ANY figure out there, heck i can make spidy go into meditation. I heard daredevil was the worst in the Legends line but i disagree, he's not unbelievable but still good. If you're fine with Electra's ""exectra's"" and punisher's support of the 2nd amendment then it's a great set, with a better deal. BUY IT NOW!"
4,almost like back-n-the-day..,"exactly as described.. i'm the one who didn't pay enough attention to notice that, although these ARE metal jacks like back in the day, they are not the same size. so the person i purchased them for was excited to get metal jacks like we played years ago, they were disappointed that they were larger than what we had thus not as challenging."
3,jacks,"remembering the old times when you used to play jacks, this set is nice, but there are only 10 jacks, you are very limited on how far up you can go, i would suggest buying two, so the game can go on and on........good fun."
2,dislike,they were not what i expected not colored jacks and they are not the original size jacks sorry i ordered them.
4,"Flimsy, but expected.","I don't remember my metal jacks of the fifties being this SMALL. But the product was cheap, so I can't complain. Whatever happened to old-fashioned Jacks??? It's always fun to find a childhood product online, and I am appreciative of being able to order this little set. But, be forewarned, this probably is not the set you remember."
3,Not the old fashion ones,They look really cheap and not metal looking. But I wanted them for my granddaughter and to bring them back in style for kids today. I remember playing with Jacks when I was a kid
2,Disappointing,"""Night Watch"" was written by Alastair MacNeill from a story by Alistair MacLean. The plot involves the theft of a famous painting. UNACO, a United Nations detective team is put on the case. There's lots of action and locations that could have been taken from a James Bond movie, but the story is neither very interesting nor very well told. What starts as a mystery ends up as a halfhearted attempt at a spy story, and the writer adds lots of unnecessary details and a subplot about one of the characters' marriage, which slows down the pace. The book also lacks MacLean's trademark humor. Not recommended."
2,Ok... maybe my daughter is a bit too young,"My daughter will be three in about 3 months and is fairly delayed in her speech. Anyways, I got this CD hoping it would make her excited to talk or at least try to start making sounds, but not so much. Its mainly just mouth exercises that she doesn't understand and doesn't care about. Maybe in about six months she'll be more interested in it, but right now, she's just too young."
3,its ok,item is ok but It would have been nice to know that I have to tape the unit to the hood.I would much rather use clips.When the sun is out bright you can see the tape under the deflector and it doesnt look good.Also I noticed it helped deflect bugs from the hood but not the windshield.I should have gotten the full size bug guard.
4,"Amazing, considering it's a student film....","Many great filmmakers rarely show their student work (if they have any). Even the great Kubrick, whose first film Fear and Desire is impossible to find, refused to have his first film shown widely (he called it a failed student exercise). But here is Andrei Tarkovsky's ""diploma"" film (as they called it in the USSR). It is wonderful. It's not Solaris, Rublev, or Stalker, but it's still worth watching over and over again. Tarkovsky was already showing his great individuality with this film. Usually student diploma films were 25 minutes and in black and white. Tarkovsky's film is 50 minutes and is in colour. The relationship between the child and the construction worker is very well done and believable, without any trace of sentimentality that always occurs in films with children (especially in American ones). When watching this, you could tell how talented Tarkovsky was. He's the rare filmmaker that never made a bad film."
4,The Steamroller and the Violin,"I realize that some of you refuse to watch a movie with subtitles, and that includes people who read my books without moving thei lips. Never mind. Andrei Tarkovksy made this back when he was 28 years old, long before he became world famous for Andrei Rublev, Solaris, The Mirror, and other films I haven't seen. (I have Solaris and will watch it soon.) His visual sense is positively stunning, to the extent that even I noticed it. It's a deceptively simple tale, about a young violinist befriending a macho (to quote the cover) steamroller driver. Not mushy or anything, though. Just very real. I'm impressed."
4,"Compromised by Communist politics, but not bad","Andrei Tarkovsky's diploma film is a minor student work, but it's still the best introduction to this Russian director. If _Steamroller_ feels too slow and ponderous for you, by all means stay away from Tarkovsky's other films. Compared to them, this one is remarkably fast-paced.The film hews much more closely to Communist-party dogma than later films, which emphasize aesthetic (and human) concerns over party politics. Naturally, the Soviet authorities denounced this tendency in Tarkovsky and sabotaged his projects, prompting him to seek asylum in Western Europe."
2,Too Many Discs,"So many discs to juggle, store and keep track of, but I guess until they put the clip art on the cloud, this is the only way to do it. And buying old programs is a cheap way to stockpile clipart. But I think if you've bought Hemera once, there's no point buying a newer version. It's all the same photos."
1,Not at all what I wanted,"It is what they said - clip art. I wanted actual full photos, these are lower quality photos of something and it is cut out of the actual picture instead of a full picture. Don't waste your money and time unless you actually want clip art retro looking graphics."
5,The Big Tease,"This is one of the cutest 'unknown' movies ever! It's sweet and funny and heartbreaking all at the same time, not to mention all the guest stars' cameos. Is there anything Craig Ferguson can't do?"
4,"Clever, and funny","Don't go in to this expecting a movie that will change your life, or will impress all your friends, but if you go with the zany fun spirit with which this movie is intended you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself. What I loved the most about the movie is that, even though he faced some serious setbacks, Crawford McKenzie, never gives up his hope and optimism. Craig Ferguson gives a delightful performance, zipping out great one liners throughout the movie, which few people are clever enough to catch. ""Marina del Rey. I once new a drag queen named Marina del Rey!"" I also loved the way that Hollywood looks in this movie. A big Touristy dump. No glamour, little glitter. Great fun, see it if you get the chance."
3,Craig Ferguson silliness,"I'm a big Fergsuon fan, so it really doesn't matter what he is in, I like to watch his humor. He is witty and funny as usual, but I find this story weak. Not nearly as spectacular as Saving Grace."
2,"I won't give 1 star, because...","I really love Craig Ferguson. I read his book, I watch his show. I think he is funny + cute + charming. But the movie was just SO dumb. Perhaps I am thankful I saw the movie, because it helped me get over my Craig crush and move on with my life :P"
4,The Big Tease,Craig Ferguson is a riot as the gay hairdresser from Scotland who thinks he's been picked to enter a competion for hairstyles. He's cute and still has a strong Scottish accent in this fun comedy.
4,More fun than a mullet . . .,"Terrific cast, gentle silliness. Craig Ferguson is wonderfully absurd and Donal Logue is his usual entertaining self in a supporting part. If you liked Saving Grace or The Tao of Steve, this is a great little movie at a great price."
4,Niagara Motel,Its not an academy award winner. But I enjoy anything Craig Ferguson is in. Its a different type comedy.If you enjoy comedies you will like it
5,How to Poke Fun at Hollywood Stylists,Craig Ferguson is wonderful as a Scottish hair dresser who thinks he isinvited to an important styling contest in California. There are many funnyscenes as he gets to the contest only to find out he is not one of thecontestants. It mimics many of the stereotypes of Southern Californiacharacters and is a lot of fun to watch.
5,Finding the 'Okina,"Other reviewers have already praised this album for its amazing musical impact, of which I wholeheartedly agree. I would add that Mark's pronunciation of the Hawaiian language is impeccable, especially the apostrophe ' that commonly occurs in Hawaiian words. Known in the language as an 'okina, this glottal stop, as it is known by linguists, is usually omitted or greatly softened in singing or chanting. Instead of that approach, Mark annunciates each one to help create unique rhythms within the basic rhythm of the chant. It's an incredible musical effect, and greatly honors the vividly expressive language of the people of Hawai'i."
5,Fabulous,"Mark's chants are . . . enchanting! I love Hawaii; hubby was stationed there in the Navy in '76 and I moved there and we got married in '77. Not that used to chants, but they are really, really great. You may want to dance because of the rhythm! He Mele No Ka'uhinele will make you smile every time you hear it! If you like Hawaiian music, you'll love this!"
4,Great for relaxing,"Greg and Steve are wonderful children's artists. This CD is a compilation of quiet music. We use it during rest time in our pre-kindergarten class. Each year, I find, after a few listenings, the children are humming along with the music. It's simple and enjoyable. A plus for any classroom."
1,"written by journalist, yes...","This book to me seems to written by journalist, yes. I question after reading this dribble that they have any real business world experience. They seemd to have just researched what was required to complete the book. I would like to see the resumes of these guides. I would like to know how many bargaining tables they have really sat behind."
2,Very Disappointing,The book tells you what women do wrong but it does not really teach you how to do it right. The authors interview a lot of people who may know something about the topic but they do not do so in depth. They then string together a lot of quotes without real analysis and practical how to. I should have known from the introduction that the authors were not experts in this area.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not really what I was looking for. I wanted to think about negotiation generally, and how I as a woman am approaching it, and how I can be more effective. Although the book has some limited general advice at the beginning, almost all of the book focuses on specific situations (buying a car, getting a divorce, etc.) Since all of the situations presented were inapplicable to me, the book was of limited value. Readers interested in this title should check the table of contents and excerpt on this page. I would not have picked this book if those features had been available when I bought it."
4,I thought I knew it all,"I have been in business to business sales for 10 years and found this book refreshing. Although it has a limited shelf-life with some very hip references, it deals with very specific topics (buying a car, a house)as well as help develop a negotiating attitude. I gave it to my mom (who has always been afraid to speak up) and my sister who pops off whatever is on her mind. Mom learned you don't get what you don't ask for and sis learned to remember ""what's in it for them"".It is an easy read-pick it up put it down."
1,Out of date edition,"Unfortunately, this edition is the 4th edition, published Sept 2007, and the 5th edition was published Sept 2009."
4,brilliant dialogue,"The missing star is - once again - because I wasn't totally convinced by the artwork. I found the drawings though captivating not really as realistic as I would've liked them.BUT: I thoroughly enjoyed the writing this time. Unlike Demon House (which I found less true to what's seen on TV) Bad Rap is not only fast paced and intense with lots of turns so that you won't suspect the killer too soon, the dialogue between our CSIs is funny, witty and rings true. I snickered a lot - and that is a very good thing indeed."
4,Memories,I read this book when I was a teenager in Germany right after it was published. Now that I had the chance to re read it I realized how many things I had forgotten about it and even now it is still getting to me.
4,Nice Refreshing Scent & Works Well - a review of Suave Strawberry Shampoo,"About the time my son turned four Johnson's baby shampoo - a household staple - began to fail us. It wasn't getting his and his older sister's hair clean and so I set about to find a replacement. Suave's Strawberry shampoo was it.This shampoo gets their hair clean and leaves it smelling nice. In addition it works fine as a body wash, which means that I can clean the entirety of their sweaty, mud splattered little bodies with one product. After using it for over a year, I can say that I've found no downside. It doesn't dry out their skin or hair, and it's affordable.Four Stars. Very Good Shampoo. Smells nice and cleans well. We use it as a body wash and it doesn't dry out or irritate my children's sensitive skin.Pam T~"
3,One Bottle?,"Er ... this is $6.75 for One Bottle? I can get it for $1.75 in dollar and discount stores. I like and use this product, but $6.75 is insane, it's Suave, for heaven's sake."
3,"Smells like candy, a good clarifying shampoo","This shampoo does not smell like strawberry. It smells like Jolly Rancher or Starburst strawberry flavored candy. Perhaps a bit like Marie Callender's frozen strawberry pie. It is sweet and artificial, but not too strong. Nevertheless, I love it. It takes me back to junior high almost instantly (when I was 12, I purchased any personal care product based on the way it smelled...bonus points for fruity). It lathers well and removes any conditioner product you might have used the prior day/week/year. If you have dry hair and are looking for conditioning shampoo, look elsewhere. This is a shampoo for stripping your hair of excess product. It is not organic, it is not eco-friendly, and it is not really natural. I use it when I need to clarify my hair (and take a nostalgic return to 9th grade)."
2,Okay for the $$ but not as sturdy as I'd like,I recieved this crib for my shower and thankfully I did not assemble it right away. I went to the local BRU and have no clue what made me lift the mattress on the display but I am glad I did. The mattress is held up with a thick piece of plywood. I asked where the typical spring type support was and was told that Delta LUV { manufacturer} does not put the spring style supports on their cribs anymore. I mentioned the sturdiness or there lack of to the clerk and she told me alot of the cribs now a days have the plywood type supports. In my eyes this crib and any with the plywood supports are not going to hold an older child who may jump around in the crib. Also how as a day bed is this plywood going to hold up? Not very good in my eyes. If I were you I'd keep looking.
4,beautiful crib !,"I had been looking all over the internet for cribs and their prices and reviews. From what I found for the price I absolutely love this style. I just wish that it had a little more stability. I mean it seems to be great so far, but the slide and lock system that is used to put it together is plastic (should be metal in my opinion!). Over-all I think it is great. I like that it converts to a toddler bed and then daybed. I hope to get lots of use from it in the future!"
4,Cute,"We received this as a shower gift. It was easy to put together. We live in a one bedroon but it fit well in our room. We used the ""Good Night Bears"" crib set as our theme. It looks like we paid more for it. So if you are on a budget go with this one. It's a good crib for the money. I'll update later on it's use once I have my daughter!"
2,a mother of four boys,We needed an extra crib because our 22 month old is still in the one that we have had for 11 years. This crib will not last 1 year. We got this for our 5 month old and it is not made that durable!! We have four boys and the older crib is made more durable. This will last for a couple of months just long enough to let our 22 month get used to a toddler bed and we can go back to using the older crib. Spend the extra money and get a better bed so it will last through other children!!!
2,Misleading Description,"Since I'm on bedrest, I had to do everything on-line. I was excited to find this crib (3 in 1)for the price that it is. We finally got it home and my husband tried to put it together and discovered that it is only a 2 in 1 (NO DAY BED). We called the local babies r us (where we purchased the item), emailed Delta, but we have a stong suspicion that the description was incorrect. This is a nice crib, didn't take much time to put it together. But we are very disappointed to discover the above. So for those of you who bought one already and those we are thinking about buying one, you may be disappointed like us if you planned to use it as a day bed as well. Keep in mind that the weight limit is only 50 lbs."
3,Arm stuck in crib,"We purchased this crib for our son because the price was right, it looked nice and it seemed very sturdy. All of this is true, however, I have one major problem with this crib - my son's arm keeps getting stuck between the rungs. It is a major problem! I do not know if another crib would be any better, but if I had it to do over again, I would have looked more closely at the amount of space between the rungs of the crib."
3,VERY nice for the $$ but the mattress wont fit properly,"I really love this crib. I love how you can hang blankets and stuff on the rails. It was VERY quick and easy to put together! One thing I dont like is you need both hands for the side to come down, sometimes its really hard to do. Theres no way you can ever do it with a baby in your arms.My main concern with this is the mattress we bought wont fit properly in it. one side wont go down all the way and its about an inch higher. I dont feel safe with this at all. Im not sure if my son will ever sleep in it, for now I only put him in it to play. (He sleeps with me and has since birth) I dont know if its the mattress or what. Id love to transition him to his crib Im just not sure how safe it would be with the mattress the way it is.Other then that, it is a VERY nice crib for the price, I was very pleased with it!"
2,poor quality,"We have twins and have bought two of these cribs. No tools are need to assemble, but no instructions are included either, so it took a while to figure out if we put them together properly. Both of them came with scratches on them too. We're not as happy with them as we'd hoped to be."
5,HELP,"Well, I love this crib it's great. I have no problems with it and I have a 20 lb 4 month old!!!!! But if there is any with the instructions still can you email me at miracleserene11@yahoo.com. I threw mine out (accident) and I have no clue how to change it to a toddler and a reg bed. Thank youMadismommy"
4,mattress does not fit,"i love the crib itself. it was very easy to put together, i did it myself when i was 8 months pregnant. the only negative thing i have to say is that i was unable to find a mattress that fit perfectly in the crib."
1,Baby stuck,This bed is awful. The sides of the bed come off the track very easly and it is hard to put back on. Also my daughter one night got stuck between the mattress and the railing luckly I was in the next room and was there to grab here as soon as possible. Please beware of this bed. It could have killed my baby.
2,"Great crib, Bad toddler bed","This is a great crib, but, it claims to convert to a toddler bed and then to a daybed. However, the way it converts to a toddler bed is by just removing the sides. So, there is no protection from rolling off the sides of the bed. Plus, there is no different way to then convert it to a toddler bed. So, it's not a 3 in 1 crib, it's just a 2 in 1 crib. And as a toddler bed it's too high off the ground and has no side rails for protection. If you are just looking for a crib then great, but for a ""3 in 1"" it fails miserably."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"I originally started my baby registry online to save us some time. I had registered for this crib and was really excited about it until we actually went to see it in person. It looks wonderful online, but on the showroom floor you can tell that it's not sturdy.If you're looking for a crib that will last through your first child, this will definitely do. If you're looking for something to last through a few children, I suggest paying the extra $100."
1,Very disappointed...,I bought this beautiful crib thinking it would be an awesome toddler bed! Yeah I was wrong my daughter is going on 2 and I decided it's time to switch the crib around. Yeah well if you buy this because it's a 3 in it's not it's only a 2 in 1. The toddler version of it is so high off the ground that first time we attempted it my little one fell out of bed and almost broke her ankle! I have to go out ontop of the 169.00 I spent on this to spend another 100.00 to buy a toddler bed. If you love this crib just make sure you don't use this as a toddler bed!
4,Great for the money,"You know, as an experienced mom buying her second crib, I found that many of the reviews have COMPLAINED about needing both hands to drop the side rails! Well, of course you WANT that to be a feature, otherwise your little angels will be able to drop those rails without much fuss and then you would really be complaining. Only adults can reach both sides of the crib at the same time. If you have one latch, those babies would be able to figure it by 6 months, then you will have them jumping the sides of the crib and falling on their cute little noggins. Trust me - the two handed latch is good! As for the quality of the crib, it is a fine crib that serves it's purpose very well. By the time the baby is getting ready for a toddler bed, the crib will be so worn out with stains, teething marks and scratches that you will want a new one for future babes... Good luck to all."
5,I don't know what people are doing to these cribs...,"I have read some of the low reviews of this cribs and, aside from the height of the mattress when converting to a toddler bed, I don't know how people are having trouble putting these together, scratching them, finding them wobbly.... This crib is so non-destructive it is ridiculous! I have had this crib for two years with an active child and there isn't a scratch on it. It is like a rock! It is rated as one of the best by consumer reports. I don't think that any crib or child is fool proof. There are things that can happen *ie- they get stuck in the rails and you pull them out - There isn't much beyond putting a child in a glass case that could protect them any better than this crib. Great price! Great looking! Great crib!"
3,beautiful crib but a 1 time use,This is a beautiful crib. Very easy to assemble just make sure you put the side slats in right. I didn't and my five year old got under it and it fell on him. If you are planning to use a dust ruffle it is very difficult to put it on. When you finally do it doesn't look right. I was disappointed in the quality of the bed. If you barely touch it to the wall the paint will scratch on it. You may want to check into another crib.
4,Hmm...,"I just received this item today. Quick shipping and item was as described. I have noticed significant reduction of distortion when played loud. It seems that it is doing what it should, however there is one problem. It seems that on heavy bass tracks, when I turn the stereo up the speakers will just cut out. So I'm stuck I can't decide whether it's better to have distortion or to lose sound completely. I may have wired it wrong, but I doubt it. If anyone has any suggestions please leave a comment."
2,I dont understand the connection,"I didnt really understand the connection made in this book. Whitman wrote about Lincoln, apparently only met him briefly twice so the writing by that poet was always from a distance. I thought this book was going to be more of the connect made between the two men in their lifetimes and it didnt show that."
1,Elementary,The book advertises to be an instructional guide to track and field. I found the book to be overpriced and elementary. The information was too basic and did not include any detailed instruction. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Not very good,This book just plain out bored me. What was the ghostwriter thinking when he wrote this? It made me wonder whether he was drugged out on narcotics or something. These books just keep getting worse and worse.
4,Good,"Ok, so things have been tough for V.C. Andrews' family since she died, but this book is actually pretty good."
5,Very creep!,"I was really sad in Willow for being so mean towards Hannah? What happened to the fighting spirit who fought her way out of the black room? I love Han, and could just imagine her boyfriend being a Creole!He was handsome, and I found it so romantic for him to abandon his girlfriend! I'm glad the deranged Uncle Psychopath, finally found his ""gal-pal""?! Huh... I would've LOVED for this to be my night out on the road, for the 2nd year around!Love the book and the eroticism in this book is highly subliminal! Siblings?"
1,HORRIBLE!,"Lame, cliche, and boring. That's it. Hannah is spoiled, self-centered and you pray for her to get a beating! She whines and cries, feels ""so unloved"" and acts like a little baby. Stop calling her Mommy, you little brat! I could punch her! If I ever met someone like Hannah I would shake them and.... ugh. I won't even think about it. Hannah is NO protagonist! You don't care about her, in fact, you come to loath and dispise her, and not because she's ""bad"", but because she's boring and stupid! What a naive little fool!!!!!!"
2,Boring!!!!,"I usually fly through VC Andrews books but this one was a chore to get through. I was very disappointed. At one point I just skipped pages to get through it. I've read so much better, but this one is just blah."
2,Hannah Banana,"this book is typical of mr niederman's ""vc andrews"" books. full of whiny brats and lame villians. honestly, even the butler in fita was more evil than the halfbrothers. in response to casey snydets statement ""what 16 year old calld her mother mommy"" answer :ALL VC ANDREWS CHARACTERS!!!!!! seriously i stopped calling mine that when i was five. oh and mr neiderman please stop referring the male sex organ as ""hardness"" or ""manliness"" it sounds so...stupid. and please stop having the characters go into detail about their periods and the proper way to insert a tampon. a real woman knows sbout this and does not go out of het way to mention it. whats next - a character who vividly describes her bowel movements?"
2,Disappointed,"The first two novels in the De Beers saga were wonderful. I highly anticipated the arrival of Twisted Roots from Amazon. The beginning was okay, gave a good insight to Linden and Willow and Miguel's relationship, as well as Hannah's relationship with her father. However, I was very disappointed in the end. This book did not have a single thrilling aspect to it. And to be honest, it was a bit of a snoozer. I was even more disappointed to find out that this is the end of Hannah. Her appearance in the De Beers saga was definitely short lived as Into the Woods features the beginning of Grace Montgomery's story. If you decide to read this saga, read the first two, skip the third and head straight into the fourth. You won't miss anything, believe me."
2,Twisted Roots,My sister warned me about this book. Told me it was stupid. But I read it anyways. And I have to say she was right. It was very boring and took me longer then expected to get through it.Willow was an idiot for some of the things she said or did to Hannah concerning baby Claude. But Hannah was also a big crybaby. Having a younger brother and sister in the home is a big adjustment no matter what your age. It's only happend to billions of other people in this world. So what. Why does Hannah have to be any different? Deal with it. You aren't the only one.I will continue to read these books. No matter how bad of reviews they get. This book was one of the of worst.
3,Prego 6th. An invitation to Italian,"The book arrived in the specified time and was at a good price, however the description provided when selecting the book was inaccurate.The description advised the book was marked up a little bit with pencil however in reality it has a considerable amount of writing in pen, which was disapointing.Besides this the book is in good condition (covers and pages are intact and not bent/torn etc)"
4,Good book for reference.,I took the full course of italian a year ago and I find myself constantly referring to this book to double check my grammar. I think it's a great book. I could never sell it.
2,"too detailed grammar, bad vocabulary","I am teaching a beginner 1-year long course to college students from this book. I find that this book over-emphasizes a lot of grammar points (which would not be used by the language learner for a long time to come), and at the same time the vocabulary items are almost useless (I ended up skipping them altogether for the last 3 chapters). There would rather be a need for words from everyday life than the topics given importance in this book. Plus, the examples it gives to explain grammatical points should be a lot simpler."
1,Worse Product I Ever Bought!,Do not buy this Cable 12IN DVI-D To DVI-D and HDMI it does not work! Save your money. It does not work quite the way I thought It would. It is too clunky. The Sound does not convert so you have to use seaparate cables for sound.
1,it has issues,"For one, the picture shown is not the actual item. Good thing I researched the part number listed. The part number is the actual item of two DVI and one HDMI. Well, I can say that the adapter did not really work right. It did not allow the computer signal out to my monitor on startup but it did work if I plugged it in after the computer already fully booted. But, the point of an adapter is not to have to keep unplugging and replugging delicate connectors right?"
5,Faith in real life,"I think this book, and the whole series, in fact, is a wonderful look at faith lived out in real life. While Mitford might be a little idealistic, it has a whole cast of characters who look like people we know and act like people we know. I like seeing how we get to see Father Tim interact with all of them, and not always in the best way! We are all sinners saved by grace, and all mess up from time to time. It is encouraging to see this portrayed in these books."
2,Book is better than the tape,"Most of the other reviews refer to the book version. A lot gets lost in the abridged tape version, more so than with many other books. This series is about character development, charming stories, detailed descriptions, etc. What you get in the tape is just the main plot line and conversation. No depth. You're better off with the books."
2,Audio Edition Not Up to Snuff,"As a late-in-coming fan to the MITFORD series, I met the audio book with leaps of joy... after all, hearing the words in the author's own voice is a rare treat! Unfortunately, the abridgement that is so necessary to keep the listening time and cost manageable makes it almost painful for a true fan to hear... you are excruciatingly aware of each and every edited scene, and every cut rankles more and more. Jan Karon is a joy to hear, and the book remains among my favorites, but for my grandmother's Christmas present, I'm looking elsewhere. At least one other audio book producer has all of the MITFORD novels unabridged, and while they're decidedly more costly, it's worth it. Listening to an abridgement of a work like AT HOME IN MITFORD is like drinking flat ginger ale... or like eating at the Grill when Percy ain't cooking!"
2,Audio Book CANNOT replace the real thing!,"I have read all of the Mitford series books out so far and LOVED them all! Excellent reading. I was excited to by the Audio Books in order to share the loved experience with my husband. So I bought the abridged audio cassettes read by the author. What a let down! You want to talk about abridged! This is very abridged. For a book that takes a lot of its basis on ""taking your time"" and ""stopping to smell the roses"", the audio book went too far in leaving entire chunks out! You do not get a feel for the characters or events. It's like Cliff Notes for ""At Home in Mitford"" on tape! I do not recommend the abridged version of these audio tapes. Made me feel very rushed and left my husband very uninterested! I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy hearing how Jan Karon ""personalized"" the characters. I especially liked her rendition of Mrs. Sadie Baxter."
5,how lovely to read a book with it's heart on it's sleeve!!,"I picked up this book on the way to the airport-having no idea what it was about but looking for some amusement on a long flight. after the first chapter or two I thought this book was too Readers Digest for me--but a few more chapters down the road -I was hooked. And couldn't we all use a Father Tim in our spiritual lives?-How appreciative I was that he had his own issues to wrestle with-his own baggage to carry-- he was 6 feet tall in my eyes! As a ""southern novel "" it was soothing to read about a town of genteel eccentric for a change as compared to the loonies often depicted in the darker southern epics. I read this book in 3 days and ran out to buy the next 2 in the series and finished both in record time.Have just purchased the last two but I am trying to savor as I don't want the experience to end!!!Keep writing Jan Karon- you are indeed a primrose in a fictional deep and dark forest."
4,great book,"My mom got this book from a friend, read it, and passed it on to me, saying ""It's a great book, you'll like it."" As a college student who alternates between reading literature and reading ""brainless"" romance books for study relief, I was skeptical of the book at first. Then I started reading it. I throughly enjoyed the story! It was well written and fun. I found myself alternately racing through chapters to see what would happen next, reading slowly and enjoying it, or laughing out loud because of something funny the characters said or did (which earned me strange looks from my roommate)! My only complaint from the book is it flowed a little too perfectly. Everything worked out perfectly in the end. Normally, I love books like that, but tthe ending was a little too perfect. That aside, this book was fantastic. I intend to finish reading Karon's series, she has something good here! I wold recommend this book to anyone who needs a fun, lazy day read. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Too sweet, too simplistic, too juvinile-lacks real conflict",This book was required in my book club and I felt like I was swimming in molasses it was so sweet except for the gross descriptions of Dooley's dumps. How can adults spend their time on such juvenile reading? It's not for me.
1,"its not Mitford, its Stepford","I don't know how so many people love this book. There is no story, no conflict that can have a satisfying resolution, no challenges, no passion- at least not up to page 155 which is where I bailed out. I thought perhaps when a new neighbor is introduced, she would discover the alien pods lurking in everyone's basement, but I see from the back cover, she actually marries the main character. They must have got her too."
3,Too Vanilla for Me,"I thought this was going to be one of the best books I had ever read but it wasn't so. The story goes on and on repeating itself in just different situations. As one of the other critics stated, I ""baled out"" before the book ended. I did make it to page 414 out of shear determination but I finally lost the battle. I am going to try the next book in the series to see if it is better than the first."
3,Just a wee warning,"I didn't think anyone else would mention this so thought it could be helpful to SOME people but there is some mild bad language in this book.I can understand why people love this kind of book, just everyday life centered around a clergy and his staff. I did find some nice Christian thoughts etc BUT a warning for those of you christians that really like a 100% clean language book. This isn't it sadly. I am not saying its really bad but I stopped reading it as there were too many ""oh my G**"" and not done in a 'prayer like way!' There were other few mild language. The first one I could see as a non christian character and the pastor putting up with it but then there were more that didn't fall into this category.I realise that this warning may not be applicable to a lot of people but for those including myself that like a 100% clean language book then I am just letting you know, that there is that small anount in there."
1,Where's the plot?,"I seem to remember hearing that a book had to have some tension in order to have a plot. If this is the case--At Home in Mitford has no plot. Several members of my family recommended this series to me. They were all in the 60-plus demographic--could that account for our differing opinions? I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. The characters are one-dimensional and barely discernible from one another. The writing is simplistic and unimaginative. And as I have mentioned, the plot is nonexistent. I won't be reading anymore about Mitford--well except if I need a good sleep aid..."
1,Satanism,"After reading this book I considered converting to Satanism just so I wouldn't be associated with these people or thier creator, Jan Karon."
5,"Wonderful, cozy, uplifting!","This book, and the whole series, is very uplifting to read. Even if you are not a Christian you will enjoy this book."
2,The Too Quiet Life,"First off, I want to say that I did enjoy this book to a certain extent. It is pleasant to visit a place where neighbors know and care for each other. I especially liked Father Tim; it is rare to see a positive portryal of clergy in fiction books these days. Yes, Mitford is a pleasant place, nice and quiet. Too quiet.Near the end of this book, I must say the story was becoming dull and too sugary sweet. There are now seven (?) of these books--which proves you only need one idea to make a living as a writer."
5,"Refreshing, relaxing, adorable","I ran across A New Song in the thrift store, started reading it, loved it, and had to go find the first one in the series.I love this book and the series. I'm on the third novel now. Some of the wording is a little jarring as if she's really from England, but I don't care. I don't care that some people think it isn't ""real"" or too sugary or whatever. I _need_ this kind of writing, and I'm not the only one.I do not read fiction most of the time. But this -- it is a comfort to me.Refreshing, relaxing, a sigh of relief. I read it before bed, when I'm sad, sick, or looking forward to some quiet time to enjoy.Thank you, Ms. Karon for providing a soothing, cozy, read without all the stupid ""poop"" in other contemporary fiction. ;)Her books are like a dear friend. A joy."
5,delightful book,What a treat to have discovered this series. They are a realistic journey into daily lives. They make me laugh and cry and write down all the little lessons learned. I've only read the first three and can't wait to read the others.
1,Welcome To Dullsville,"This is the most boring book I have read in a very long time. The chraracters are all introduced as if you already know all about them; there is very little depth to the character development, even for the main characters. They are all ""nice"", which is very dull when it lasts throughout the entire story. And where's the plot? The preacher wanders the town, out of touch with all reality except that of his little sphere, and minor things happen to him. Pointless. Skip this book and read something with substance."
1,Deeply disappointing,"I so wanted to like this book. I live near the area that inspired the Mitford series and for years have meant to get around to reading the first installment. I was shocked to discover how tedious and poorly written it is. Karon doesn't seem to have a natural feel for engaging plot development. Her narrative is forced, contrived and often full of holes. Her characters are disappointingly one-dimensional and her belabored efforts to capture regional dialogue are shameful. I imagine it is possible that this series improves as it moves along but I found At Home in Mitford so painful there is no chance that I will continue. My hat is off to the powerful marketing minds that promote this series because they have definitely spun a silk purse out of a sow's ear. My recommendation is to not fall prey to the advertising hype. Borrow, do not buy, the first book. If for some reason it clicks for you, then you can invest in purchased copies of the subsequent books in the series."
2,No Depth,I read At Home In Mitford and though it a book without depth. It reminded me at first of James Herriot's books. His books I liked; this I didn't care for too much. There were no surprises. Also no suspense throughout the book. I knew what was going to happen. There would be a new heart for Olivia. Emma would marry her much younger man. I actually had to put the book down when the man came out of the bell tower. Not really. Would a real preacher want a wife who lets rollers in her hair? It is cute for the story but not in real life. All in all I simply didn't seem to be able to get in this book. It was a cute read. The end
1,Boring!!!,"My husband and I have a basic rule for movie or television watching, and I'll pass it on to all of you : ""Never keep watching a movie/program about people who are more boring than you are."" After just a few chapters of Mitford, I'm ready to extend the rule to books. The Mitford people are the world's dullest! I'll never be able to finish this book, and wouldn't want to -- there are too many interesting stories in the world (fictional and nonfictional)-- why waste time with dull ones? (PS. Like the characters in the book, we live in a small southern town and we are Episcopalians. I don't recognize either the atmosphere of the town of Mitford or the characteristics of the people.)"
1,I Don't Get It,"I've seen these books everywhere, (That should have been my first clue - truly excellent books don't end up in the dollar resale bin) so I was looking forward to reading this when it turned up on my book club list. If you ever find out you have two weeks left to live, move to Mitford because every day is a freaking eternity! I would not have finished this incredibly boring, preachy, plotless book if it wasn't required reading for the book club. Needless to say, I'm not interested in the rest of the series. If you want to read about a bunch of lily-white, holier-than-thou, cutesy, unbelievable small-town folks (who must have some secret income somewhere, because their jobs and their lifestyles are completely incompatible), then this is the book for you. I thought it was one long snooze."
1,Very Slow,"I like the book, however, I find it to be very slow. I am constantly waiting for something exciting to happen. I do like the way it is written as if it's everyday life."
2,One visit is more than enough,"I agree with the negative reviews ... poorly written, boring, flat characters, utterly predictable and annoying. However, I also somewhat understand the appeal of this book. Warm, safe and comfortable.It is a chore to ""keep caring"" up until the end. One of my problems was I hated Cynthia. (Tim's love interest) WHAT A SILLY PUTZ.""You were wonderful"" she coos to Father Tim after he plays the ""knight"" and rescues her cat (again) because ""oh Lordy pooor Violet""""You're lovely"" she says to Father Tim. Who goes around saying ""you're lovely"" to people they hardly know?She acts like a child half the time. She actually cried when she burnt supper and knightly Tim has to rescue her once again. Blech and double blech. I kept hoping she'd die or fall in love with someone else.I am utterly aghast that this book has turned into an actual SERIES. YIKES. THAT is going TOO far. I would never read another Mitford book."
2,Bland beyond belief,"I had such expectations for this series, hoping for a good readable story without all the unsavory things that turn up in books these days. Well--lucky for me that I checked the first one out of the library and did not waste my money. The characters are flat, two-dimensional, and do not think or speak as real human beings. I was stumbling through, forcing down a few pages each night, but after the insufferable brat Dooley appeared with his ""poop"" obsession, I gladly gave this one back to the library. Everything in this book is lame--characterization, dialogue, plot (if there is one). This one is bland beyond hope."
1,On the other side of dull,"This book was so boring. Nothing happened, dog barked, pastor took a walk, rode his scooter, visited the hospital...If your looking for an exciting/drama filled book you will be disapointed. This would be a good book if there is nothing else to do and you just want something very calming to read."
4,A caveat...,"This book is an incredibly well written prose tone poem. I admire the craftmanship... I admire the beauty of the subject... but I have rarely been so bored in my life. I'm going to finish the book though. I think it probably is good for me. But... there are no gladiators, no high speed chases, no Andu'uvian death rays, no smashing planets, no knights at war, no.... well you get the picture. I don't know how to rate it. I want to give it a ""zero stars"" and I want to give it a ""five stars"".... I do honestly think that many people would enjoy this book. It's restful. There is much love portrayed here. But... there are no gladiators."
1,A New Song,"Having read the 5th book in the Miford series first, I appreciated the character reviews that Jan Karon gave. I got so engrossed in those characters that I am now starting the read At Home In Mitford and intend to read all of the Mitford books. As I grew up in a Methodist parsonage, these books with Father Tim are very heart warming to me. I'm glad Karon gave those small character reviews for me."
5,Wonderfully written,"This book has it all---good plot, great characterzations, and humor. I could not wait to follow up the book with the another one--to ""visit"" Mitford and all the people that inhabit this magical place. Each book has new intrigues to keep readers motivated to come back for more.Like many things I find myself doing, I began reading Jan Karon's books, backwards---that is, I started with HOME TO HOLLY SPRINGS. And that might be the best way to do it. I was so captivated by Father Tim's character that I could not wait to go back to the first book in the series. I have not been disappointed."
4,At Home In Mitford,"I must admit that I wasn't too excited about Christian reading, but this was a delightful book. Excellent characterizations.I am ready to move to Mitford and open a women's shoe store. (You will need to read the book to understand.)Rusks@Juno.com"
5,Come on home!,"Jan Karon creates an absorbing cast of characters in this novel, the first of the Mitford series.Central to the story is Father Tim Kavanaugh, bachelor priest at the Lord's Chapel Episcopalian church in the small mountain town of Mitford, North Carolina. Father Tim leads a quiet life. That is until Barnabas the dog and Dooley Barlowe the pre-adolescent enter his life, and he begins to develop a friendship with his neighbor Cynthia Coopersmith, and countless professional and personal concerns intervene.The plot is interesting, but the book stands out for its likable, true-to-life characters, and for the peaceful atmosphere that permeates it. Father Tim, with his unflagging devotion to God, is an inspiration.Jan Karon's books have entered my canon of ""comfort reading,"" perfect for a pick-me-up when I tire of the darkness and dysfunction of many modern novels."
5,Wow,"As an author AND a reader, my inner critic is always ""on,"" but I have to tell you these books -- at least in my opinion -- are as close to perfection as it gets! I am almost finished with book #3, and I have grown to love these characters. Fr Tim, Dooley, Cynthia, Puny, Sadie, Uncle Billy, and the list goes on and on. I have had some laugh-out-loud moments, but what I really love about the series is that it focuses on the goodness of people. With all the awful news we see on TV -- there are times I have to turn off the news for a couple of weeks because it is ALWAYS bad -- but Jan Karon's books are like a soothing balm. We need more books like these! Jan, thank you for giving the world-weary something to cling to and for reminding us that love is the greatest gift in the world. I will mourn the ending of the series. Charlotte Hughes -- real name"
4,ram112352,"I am really enjoying this book and can't wait to read others in this series. It makes me fell good, like coming home."
5,Fabulous and uplifting story of a town and it's priest.,"Karon makes you feel like you know these people and their town. Their Christ centered lives are both human and uplifting. It's definitely a feel good book. It's extremely well written with marvelous characters, and brings back faith in modern literature."
4,good writer,She is such a good writer that she can tell a great story with using such fowl language to describe the situation.
3,A quiet simple story that you'll either like or find slow,"Keep reading and give it a try. Let yourself relax and enjoy the town of Mitford. You'll enjoy like I did a sense of calm and accomplishment for the time you spend in Mitford with different people. I did have a slow time getting into this book but am very glad I gave it a chance and really enjoyed a simple story for a change to our busy life styles. Don't think I would give this book my highest rating or recommendation only because it is so slow and simple that it doesn't give you the desire to keep picking it up to read about characters with depth. If your looking for something different, give it a try."
1,Boring boring boring,"Well, I finally finished slogging through Jan Karon's ""At Home in Mitford"" more than a month after starting it. I haven't found any book to be such a chore to get through in a very long time. If you're a fan of good literature, don't believe the hype and AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE. If you're offended by anything and everything the secular world offers up, then by all means visit the local library and check this out in order to be clubbed over the head with 450 pages of inoffensive drivel. Just don't tell me what a wonderful book this is. Because it isn't. THIS IS NOT A GOOD BOOK. PERIOD. No plot, poorly written, and dull, flat, one dimensional, forgettable charcters. Need I go on? And there are eight books in this series? I can't even imagine. Marketing genius but little else.For a vastly superior series of novels set in rural America with a religious theme, check out anything by Jon Hassler. He blows this Mitford nonsense right out of the water."
3,AT HOME IN MITFORD,"13.00 PLUS TAX FOR A FIFTEEN YR. OLD BOOK IS WAY GREEDY AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER KINDLE BOOKS. THE PRICES KEEP CREEPING UP. I WILL NOT ORDER THE REST OF THIS SERIES ......AS A RESULT.MOST PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO ME THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AMAZON. WRONG! I CALLED AMAZON BEFORE I WROTE THIS REVIEW, I ASKED THEM WHO SET THE PRICES AND WAS TOLD IT IS ACOMBINATION OF THE PUBLISHERS as well as AMAZON. WHO GETS A GOOD CUT OF THE SALE."
5,Excellent,I loved the first 2 books and can't wait to read the other 5. I highly recommend this book to anyome. I especially enjoyed it since I came from a small town and can identify with Father Tim and all the things he encounters.
4,"Ms. Karon's reading gives a lovely touch, but...",I enjoyed the cassette version on At home In Mitford read by Ms Karon. Unfortunately it is abridged and looses some from the whole book in the process. I will buy my own copy when it is available unabridged.
2,"At ""Ho-Hum"" in Mitford","The rock group Talking Heads did a song that goes ""Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens."" I don't really agree with those sentiments, but substitute ""Mitford"" for ""Heaven"" and it becomes a lot more accurate. At first I thought Mitford might be similar to the Mayberry of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" with a cleric instead of a sheriff as the lead character, but actually, Mitford seems to be a place where people from Mayberry would go to escape the hustle and bustle. Plus, as annoyingly quirky as the Mitford characters are, there is nobody there as well-drawn as Barney, Gomer, or Floyd the barber. Maybe this book would work better as a TV show. Or as a sleeping pill."
2,Slow as molasses on a cold morning....,"...applies to this writer's attempts to evoke a 'folksy' ambience in her Carolina mountain town. Unfortunately, what little plot there is seems very contrived; attempts at representing vernacular speech are awkward; paper doll characters plod through the standard ""village locales"".The premise of following villagers' daily lives is similar to the PBS tv presentation of the series 'Ballykissangel' but without any of the hilarity, pathos or conflict which that series so ably portrayed.I'm pushing through to the end, reading aloud sections in the evening, during which my husband invariable drifts off to sleep."
4,"Mitford is ""All That""","Thank you AMAZON.COM for this forum. You are the C-SPAN of the book selling world! I read the first one in March of '97 and couldn't put it down. I have now just started number four and must say that the returns have diminished a little but that is only natural considering how much I enjoyed the first and second. This Mitford juggernaut will not be stopped and the rest of ""you"" need to get on board. I do agree that the dialogue can weaken at times (I grew weary of Tim's ""Indeed"" and ""Consider it done"") but for a work so heavy on characters this is a minor annoyance. I read with interest all of the reviews and found even the negative ones to be sincere and if I were the author I would be pleased to know that people were so strongly moved one way or the other by my work. Jan Karon is to be admired for taking a chance and working years to be an ""overnight"" success!"
5,AT HOME IN MITFORD,"I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK, IN FACT THE WHOLE MITFORD SERIES BY JAN KARON, TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS A GOOD WHOLESOME TALE, WELL TOLD AND WITH REALISTIC, LIKEABLE CHARACTORS. BY THE TIME YOU HAVE FINISHED READING EACH STORY YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU ACTUALLY KNOW THESE PEOPLE, AND HATE TO SEE THE BOOK END."
4,Excellent In Its Niche,"Jan Karon has a reliable writing style with a gift for detail. Her characters are fully drawn, including their different cadences and dialects. There were times in this book that I wanted the plot to make itself known, but it's not a plot-driven book, so I took a deep breath and really tried to appreciate the pace and world that is Mitford. I loved Karon's tendency to place stories within the story, almost as hidden little gems (not to make too much of a play on the gem caper in the story). Overall, a very enjoyable read."
3,Sweet Story,"I must admit I had a little difficulty getting into the characters at first, but once I did, I enjoyed the read. I will have to go back and make note of some of the statements I found quite moving and made me do some reflective thinking. I wish the book hadn't ended as it did -- seemed like it ended abruptly and was surprised there were no other chapters. I do love the feel-good story line even though maybe not be true to life. However, I was entertained."
4,love the series,"I love this entire series of books. It was lighthearted, good reading that I enjoyed very much. Jan Karon does an excellent job of drawing you into the lives of Father Tim and all his cohorts for his adventures along the way."
4,A Refreshing Change,"I loved this book, Mitford sounds like an ideal place to live in. This was a nice change from a lot of the depressing books I've been reading lately!"
5,Travel through Mitford to Bliss,"I'm a big Mitford fan. Have been from the beginning. It's so nice to find a retreat from a tough world. Having read every Mitford book, I was delighted to find another book that travels the same course. (I needed a new book to read). If you love Mitford, you'll love Bliss, Mississippi in the new novel The Town That Came A-Courtin'. I have read an advance reading copy and strongly recommend it to all who love Mitford. We cannot have too many books with Christian values, quirky characters and pure fun and joy."
4,In lieu of flowers,"After reading this engaging, uplifting book, I bought a copy and sent it to my friend who had just lost her mother. Although my friend is back in the swing of things, I sent her this book in memory of her mother for that day when she feels lonely and misses her mom and could use a faithful friend like Father Tim. It's that kind of book"
2,"Syrupy, insipid, predictable","A rather insubstantial, predictable lightweight novel. I would suggest readers try reading ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" to get a better picture of small town southern life. Way too heavy on the religion too - I wouldn't have bought it if that had been apparent in the reviews"
5,Food for the soul!,"""At Home"" is one of those books that you wish could go on forever. I wanted so much to be able to sit at the grill and converse with Father Tim. Jan Karon works magic with the vernacular.My wife and I enjoyed the book so much we visited Blowing Rock, the small mountain town that inspired Jan Karon."
5,"Wonderful, clean, I have read it 4 times & will read again.","I have read all 4 Midford books 4 times and am anxiously waiting for a new one. These are well written and if there were such a place as Mitford, I would enjoy living there and knowing these people. Three cheers for Jan Karon."
2,Enjoy Visiting Mitford BUT The Main Character Is Boring,"I have read the first three books of the Mitford series and I am more interested in Cynthia, Miss Sadie, Rose, Billy, Puny, and the group at Main Street Grill than I am in Father Tim. I think Tim spends too much time wallowing in self-pity. Tim even admits to wallowing, but does nothing about it - except say thankful prayers for having Cynthia and the others who put up with him...then he continues to think of himself. Tim is a weak main character that has yet to gain any strength.I do enjoy the Town of Mitford - I hope Jan Karon gives Cynthia, Puny and the characters at the Main Street Grill a voice - I am tired of hearing about them through Father Tim.I highly recommend the Miss Read series of which J. Karon has spoken. Miss Read is a strong main character with that wonderful English wit - that only the English can master."
4,Cutting the sweetness with salt,"I appreciate Jane Austen and her village characters and as a result I appreciate Jan Karon's memorable cast of villagers.My sister-in-law gave this to me for my birthday, and I took a time before reading it. It seemed so simple after the convoluted tales that pass for reading material these days but, unlike orange marmalade cake, it is practically guilt-free. That's saying something!I've read a few more in the Mitford series and always appreciate the struggles of everyday faith. I especially appreciated the words used to answer the man in the attic ""You should be asking, is He down here?"" There is the salt to cut the sweetness."
5,New American Classic,Jan Karon's gift is a treasury for all who enter the world of Mitford. Reading or giving this series of books is a gift for all.
5,What a pleasure!,"What a pleasure this and all of Karon's books are! Pure delight with their Mayberryesque type settings. True, they have more than a little ""Christian"" attitude thrown in, but it's all part of the theme.The characters in this book are so likeable. Yes, this is not the real world, but who wants that all the time. It's a great escape from things like the rampant commercialism and decay we all live with. Just give me a good book that I can fall into any day and I'll be happy. If you liked ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" or ""Bark of the Dogwood"" you'll probably like this book as well, though those two have more than a little ""real life"" in them. All-in-all these books are great reads and shouldn't be missed. All of Karon's books are great."
4,a very sweet book,"At first, I did not want to read this book because my mom recomended it and my mom and I have different tastes when it comes to literature. But she insisted that I read it, so I did. I loved the book. It is a nice escape after a hectic day. I have just started on the 3rd book of the series. I've had a yearning to visit a small town in the mountains since I have started reading these books."
5,The beginning of a series that will capture your heart.,"My sister-in-law gave me At Home In Mitford as part of a ""care package"" when I was in town for my father's funeral. Little did I know at the time, but it was a book that would change my life forever. I fell in love with Father Tim and the zany characters of Mitford. Book I of this six book series made me crave for more. My ""sis"" and I agree that ""there's a little bit of Mitford in all of us"". Enjoy meeting the characters in Book I. They become the kind of people you want in your life. My spiritual faith was being tested with the illness and subsequent death of my father. Mitford renewed my spirit and made me focus on the really important things in life: the simple compassion of a place and its people. It was the perfect gift. You'll love Mitford and you'll yearn for more."
5,Sweet intrigue keeps readers turning the page,"This was my first Jan Karon book, and I have now read the entire Mitford series. She does a great job of integrating relationships among characters and delivers a moral lesson or inspires simple laughter from her character situations. It is wonderful to have such wholesome enjoyment and relaxation in the midst of today's jaded society."
2,Shallow,"This book has no depth. It is dull and easy to put down. The characters have real problems, but never seem to be affected by them. The book is shallow and unrealistic, but if you want to read something that is easy and doesn't make you do any thinking, read it. I thought it was a complete waste of time."
2,"A book of Faith, in a town, and time which is pure fiction.","Mitford is town in the South, in which, I'm sure, everyone has blond hair and blue eyes.Ms Karon has managed to fictionalize a revisionist view of the South, in a town in which no evil exists, and everyone Loves everyone - except for the newspaper editor.Whatever evil exists, is extrinsic to Mitford.Tensions, when they are occur, are quickly resolved.The amount of sugar in this book is enough to send any diabetic's blood sugar soaring.One trip to this town was all I would want, or could take."
2,Enjoyable and Light but Enough Already,"This was enjoyable and was a light read, despite the dog who understood scripture, which was a bit overdone. I wasn't able to get past the first 3 pages of the next book, A Light in the Window, because it was just too much of the same 'ol same 'ol. I'd recommend this book as a light read in between really good literature, but save the sequels for once a year reads."
3,"Way too high on the ""cuteness"" factor","I read this book a year ago and was looking forward to reading the whole series. I liked the idea of a priest as the main character because I like to see religion treated as an important part of people's lives. Ultimately, I was disappointed in the book. The characters were too predictable and problems resolved too easily. The book was too ""cute"" for my taste. Mitford is charming, but about as realistic as Mayberry."
3,"Sweet, but so what?","If a grouchy Unitarian can find something to like in this book, you know it must be good. Sure, it's sweet, but if you eat a balanced diet and get plently of exercise you'll have nothing to fear. The cynics who are appalled at the nice people in this book and the wish the world would be better if we were kinder to one another must be dead to hope."
4,"If your life is hectic, try this at the end of a busy day","I loved the Mitford series. At times, they are somewhat slow but I found them all hilarious and relaxing. No confusing plots, no fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants love scenes, no complex characters, which, in this day and age, is somewhat refreshing. I found myself smiling a lot and laughing out loud many times. Father Tim is a friend to all and we should all be so lucky to live in a town like Mitford."
5,I'm Ready to Move to Mitford!,"What a wonderful book! I am writing this after I have read the entire series and am waiting with baited breath for the next book. I love the way Jan Karon tells a story bringing in all the quirky characters of a small town and making the reader feel a part of the scene. From the time Father Tim meets the stray dog, Barnabas (who, as fate would have it only responds when Father Tim quotes scripture to him) to the scenes at different settings around town, I loved this book and this series like I've loved no other. My mother, in her 80s, has read them and then passed them on to a friend of hers (whose husband, now deceased, was a pastor in the town of Blowing Rock, NC, the town where the author lives and which was an inspiration for the town of Mitford). These are stories to be savored and read again and again. Very highly recommended!"
4,The choices you make shape your life,"After the depressing, cynical realism of much contemporary fiction, I was utterly smitten by At Home in Mitford. It didn't look exciting at first, but the more I read, the more I couldn't stop reading. It is utter delight! Quite like eating popcorn or going for a walk on a crisp spring day! If you want a book with good values, the ""milk of human kindness"", clean humor, hope and simplicity, read this book. I loved its pace. It ambled. It felt like I was experiencing daily life with ordinary people; but, because Mitford is such a sweet magical place, I never wanted it to end. I was also touched by the way characters made choices that changed their lives, especially Homeless Hobbes and George Gaynor. Awesome! Read this book if you want to remember that life can be charming, simple, meaningful and lovely. If anyone else loved this book and can recommend similar books, please let me know. Thanks!"
5,"a joyfilled refreshing look at God ""at work""","This first in the Mitford series is a wonderful introduction to characters so real that they made my heart ache with pleasure for people I grew up knowing. Ms Karon's writing reflects a deeply personal spirtual journey. I am grateful that she has chosen to share her ""Mitford family"" with the rest of us."
4,Relaxing,"This is the perfect book to wind-down with. At the end of a long day full of stress and chaos I can hardly wait to curl up with this book and take an enchanting trip to Mitford. I feel as though, if I were not so enthralled with the story, that I could call on Father Tim and tell him my troubles while Barnabus snoozes with his head on my foot. Thank goodness for uncomplicated, soul satisfying reading when you need it."
1,waste of time,"come on! please. you've got to be kidding. are you for real? holy smokes. can it be? if you loved these cliches, you'll love this book. if not, pick something with content to read, otherwise your entire college education could be evaporated by the time you finish the first book in this series. please! money isn't everything, but the author must think so. there is marketing genius and nothing else behind this series. good luck!"
1,"This is a satire, right?","This is a satire, right? Otherwise, I must conclude that one of the copywriters for the Smith & Hawken catalog has been given a book contract for some unfathomable reason. The attraction of this series escapes me, but I guess that's what makes the world go round, as they say."
3,Fairytales from the bible-belt,"For a liberally minded European living in a large city this book was a strange experience. Yes, I felt drawn into the lives of the people of Mitford and it is a pleasure to read. But you have to deal with religious fairytales or propaganda like ""prayers always help"", at least for the characters in this book, who get healed against all odds (what about the prayers for those who didn't make it is a question that never arises here). Some behavior seemingly normal in Mitford would be considered on the verge of lunatic fringe where I live. So this book at least gives an interesting insight (correctly or not) into the thinking and feeling of a part of the U.S."
3,A delightful excape from life,"At first I thought I was not going to finish this book because it seemed so saccharine, but I admit, like other readers, I was drawn into it and began to care for the characters, enough to want to find out more about them and their adventures. One thought: why did the author introduce ""villains"", e.g., Father Tim's father, only as figures in the deep past. Was she unable to deal with such characters in her book's ""present""? I guess I'll pass up the other books in the series--unless I get very sick and just want to totally escape from the full range of life's experiences."
1,<Yawn>,"This book will appeal to a certain group of people who are offended by just about anything; truly there isn't an offensive word or situation therein (unless you count Dooley's repeated use of the word ""poop""). I prefer my stories and characters with a little more depth.As for this story, I didn't believe a word of it."
1,"Precious, just precious!","Do not let your Dentist know you are reading this.Your teeth are in jeopardy from all the sweetness.It is what Mayberry might have been if Andy Taylorhad been an Episcopal Priest (or Vicar).The author has created an idyllic English villagein the mountains of North Carolina, complete with tea andapple pies beside cozy fires.It was just too much for me, too many eccentricvillagers, too much good home cooking, too muchsweetness and light.Hart Hooper"
1,Ack! Too wholesome and preachy!,"This book is just too nice. And I mean that in the blandest sense of the word. Unrealistic dialogue and unbelievable resolutions to conflict made me put the book down before I was 3 quarters of the way through. I don't mind stories about clergy, but I do mind being preached at."
2,NOT at home in Mitford,"I really wanted to like this book, but it is sooo slow and sooo syrupy-sweet that I couldn't endure it any longer. I appreciate the intent of showcasing old fashioned country living, but this was ridiculous. If you like hanging around old church-going people, whose main worries, (for example), are what to cook for the annual church bake-fest, then you will love this book. Otherwise, I'd suggest passing on it, because that really is the ""speed"" of the novel."
2,Starry eyed author with predictable characters,"I read this book upon the recommendation of my godmother who lives in North Carolina. Perhaps being a resident of that state makes this syrupy saga more palatable but I found it discomforting that the solitary ""outreach"" program the church promoted was a bi-annual visit to one homeless person carrying some food. It was also disheartening that the only black in the story was the town matriarch's housekeeper!"
3,Mitford is Norman Rockwell America,"I really wanted to like it, and agree with one reviewer who wrote it seems like Christian genre. If it were a movie, it would get a ""G"" rating. It has the tone and feeling of an idealized America, circa early 1950s, as those the characters were in a Norman Rockwell painting. Most of the folks are so good, it was hard to distinguish the cast of characters, and wish the author had listed them in a ""who's who."" And while I read it to the end, it didn't grab me in a way that makes me want to read the series, which I find oddly disappointing."
4,Like a perfect fruit salad -- delectable and nourishing,"After hearing friends and on-line acquaintances rave about the Mitford books for the past year or so, I decided it was high time I actually purchase and read one, but I must confess I was skeptical that it could be *that* good.Well, I am here to tell you I was wrong. This is one of the best works of modern fiction I have ever read. The characters seemed to move into my home with me, the wordcraft was like a fine tapestry, and the soul was refreshed and nourished by the living faith of Father Tim that rang true through the book. I was almost shocked that a book's language and portrayal of life could be so simple and yet so true.I am not in a big rush to get the next installment, only because I am still savoring the last, and dread the day when I have ""outread"" Ms. Karon's writing and must wait for the next. I am content to extend the enjoyment as long as I am humanly able to."
5,A book for sharing,"I just finished book one this morning & have 3 major things on my list. One, get the next 3 books ASAP. Two, take book one to a friend who's heading for the hospital. Three, purchase more copies to send to folks I love. Thank goodness for a writer to take up Elizabeth Goudge's mantle. (And I noticed from Amazon that several of EG's books will soon be available!)"
4,good insurance,"I just bought this one but have used my old Powerbook version for years. I write a lot and have worn the letters off of a couple keyboards. With this shield that won't happen. It also protects the keyboard from food crumbs. Yes, I know that I shouldn't eat at the computer but I do.The shield does take a bit of getting used to. Honestly, it feels a bit strange for a while but it doesn't get in the way of typing. After a couple of weeks I realized that I didn't notice the surface any more.If you don't have problems like mine and don't eat around your laptop then the protector is just an added expense. If you live with your laptop always in reach then do consider getting one."
3,A great coffee table or bedside table book,"Pretty pictures, excellent photography, lots of neat things to look at, visually stimulating--this is a great book to leave out as a conversation piece. Or to thumb through before bed, very relaxing!But as far as the knowledge dispersed, it is nothing new. Or maybe I just know my percales and thread counts and different fill fibers better than the average shopper?Like the average shopper even cares?If you want a how to guide...this ain't it! If you want eye candy, feast your eyes on this!"
3,Less-than-stellar recording by a great artist.,"Relatively superficial (and slightly out of tune) effort by an artist who specializes in raw Delta blues. Lacks the intensity and originality of many of of his other CDs. It has a pleasant 'jamming in the living room' atmosphere, but fails to provide the intensity that Burnside supplie on nearly every other one of his albums."
5,FIRE-FIGHTIN' WOODY,"This Toy Story Woody doll, is really fun, too! It comes with a penguin and 2 hats, plus a backpack that shoots out palstic water! This talkin Woody has had many fires to put out.....and he is always ready for his next adventure! Another great imagination-making toy! The Woody doll is loved by both boys and girls!"
3,Batteries!!!,"Woody talks when you pull the string, but at the expense of three special batteries.. the little disc kind. It cost $8.00 to replace the batteries.We just bought this present at for Chirstmas and it is only April, and I have already had to replace the batteries..This is the last time I will replace them..It would be nice if it used like a AA or AAA batteries instead of batteries that I had to buy at a speciality store."
5,Another Toy Story Woody,"This is the second Woody doll my granddaughter has received. The first was beheaded by her younger 2 yr. old brother. After several attempts to repair the first Woody made by Tink Toys (China) for Disney; I found this Fire Fighting Woody by Hasbro. So far, he still talks loud enough so you can hear him and all his body parts are intact. The additional parts are extras to keep track of but provide more imaginary adventures."
1,Disappointing,"Love math, but this book is not a quick cheat sheet to study from. If you are a broker, don't waste your money. If you're an investor trying to learn more, you can do better."
3,Ktchen ware,"The pan is too heavy, does not have a rack or a lid. Difficult to handle. I would not recoment it"
4,Great Value/Beautiful Watch/Wife Loves It!,"I purchased this watch for my wife and she simply loves it. Previously I had given her two Seiko's and a Diamond Citizen Echo Drive. She wears those watches quite a bit but she wears this watch much, much more. And it cost much, much less!The rose gold is very different and what is advertised as a blue face is actually closer to purple. It is very unusual and she gets comments all the time. I posted a picture of the watch because the one on this page just does not do the watch justice. My picture does not either. The watch looks better.The 10 year battery just about makes this watch free if you consider paying around $10 a year for a new battery on other quartz watches.This watch looks great and is a bargain at less than $70!Highly recommended!"
4,Color changed!,"I purchased this watch over a year ago. I love the look and feel of it and the fact that it has a 10-year battery. However, after about 6 months, the lovely rose gold color changed to regular gold. It was so gradual, I actually did not notice for awhile, until I took out the extra links from my jewelry box that I had removed when I bought the watch. There is a definite difference! I miss the unique rose gold color, although it is still a nice gold watch. Does anyone know if this is due to chemistry and I have changed the color by wearing the watch?"
3,The Pearl is a fascinating story of an evil organic gem.,"When Kino finds a magnificent pearl, one larger than ever seen before while diving, everybody wants to get to it. All Kino and his wife want to do is get away from it, for it brings evil, destruction, and even death to their home. Kino wants nothing to do with it, but finds that it is too late to dispose of it. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat with its adventurous plot. It entertains and excites you no matter how many times you read it. The best part of all was when Kino and his wife Juana were forced to flee their home and make a run for their lives. This story presents a satisfying plot with well-drawn characters and a thrilling adventure for all readers."
3,uhhh hmmm,"well its funny how half the people say it is really exciting, and half say it is really boring, personally i think this 100 page book should be shortened to about 50. It is a pretty good plot, but it just carrys on too much. There should have been more sub plots to it if it were 100 pages. Its not that great of a book but it is ok. A mexican family finds a pearl, the greatest pearl of all pearls, he trys to sell it but nobody wants to buy it because they believe it is fake. His wife thinks is brings evil to the family and wants to throw it back... READ IT AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS. Oh the suspense... you just have to find out, it is amazing (not really) but if you have a couple of hours, you can read this."
2,A book with a good lesson,"The Pearl by John Steinbeck is a very good book. I would recommend this book for everybody because it is a good story about how a person's life can change so quickly. A poor Indian family didn't have the money to take their sick baby to the doctor until they found ""The Pearl of the World"" and it turned their lives around. Kino (the main character) doesn't think twice about all the things they can get with it. Greed starts to take over Kino and the pearl turns to evil. At the end Kino finally realizes that the most important thing to him is family, but it's too late."
3,One of Steinbeck's simpiler works,"This book was well written and very imgonative, but the writting was very simple. It wasen't very challenging but the moral of the story was a good one. It really made you think about the human personality. Our fears and desires."
2,Recommended for younger readers.,"I didn't like the book that much, it seemed like it was for younger children. I think that if I had read it in 4th or 5th grade I would have enjoyed it more. I would recommend it to younger children. I give The Pearl two stars."
2,"Valuable lessons, but doesn't pull the reader in.","The Pearl was a tale that taught valuable lessons, however, it did not pull me in to the story, as if I were sitting with the characters."
3,Symbolic tale of good and evil is well-written.,The Pearl is a well written novel that was brought to us by the wonderful author John Steinbeck. It shows a lot of symbolizm and can be interpreted in many ways and meanings. It shows how the forces of good and evil can fight against each other and take over ones soul changing it for the better or worse. I the story you will meet many characters and learn what decisions they make during tough times.
2,A fairly good book w/ both good features and mediocre parts,"The Pearl is a pretty good book which is well written and is very descriptive. John Steinbeck has better books, but this one isn't to bad. The plot of finding a gigantic pearl and trying to get the best price for it is a good setting. The book shows how some people are taken advantage of, and how far people will go to get what they want. Overall, it's a fairly good book."
3,The Pearl,"The Pearl taught a very good lesson about greediness. It taught me that you shouldn't let money or possessions get in the way of family and friends. Even though the pearl had some good lessons I couldn't really get into it. Kino and his life were so different from mine that I just couldn't relate. This book was a mix of good lessons and sad situations. I would rather read a book that teaches me lessons in a less sad way. The book had a very sad, unexpected ending that just kind of left me hanging."
3,Simplistic Morality Tale,"This book is very simplistic & straightforward. A poor couple have their lives turned upside down when they come into posession of a giant pearl. Their once simple, happy lives are now filled with turmoil. The pearl is symbolic of the ""money is the root of all evil"" concept. This book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know, and is really best-suited for young people."
2,The Pearl,"I thought that The Pearl was boring. There were only a couple of exciting parts, but the rest was boring. The story teaches a good point, though. It teaches that riches can't buy happyness, but can ruin a family. I think that Steinback could have said the same thing, but made it more interesting. The story could easily be a true story, and I'm sure its based on one, but it isn'y really a likable storyline. I think that the story was supposed to be symbolic because every sound that happens is translated into music. Kino, the main character hears the ""music of the family"", the ""music of the enemy"", the ""music of the pearl"", etc. so it gets kind of boring. Every so often, there is a word in Spanish, and if you don't understand Spanish, it is a little confusing. The book is okay, but I definatly wouldn't recomend it."
1,It was horribly boring,This book was a very classic american tale. It was quite boring and if it wasn't for a book report I would have stopped reading it on page 6. It was short and was extremely easy. I suggest you read Of MICE AND MEN if you can.
3,The Pearl,"The Pearl by John Steinbeck, is an exciting story about a man named Kino, who is a poor diver, and one day he finds a pearl in the ocean. He thinks that is the most valuable pearl ever. However, his wife Juana thinks that the pearl is going to bring them the evil. She is afraid and worried, and wants Kino to throw the pearl back into the ocean. Kino does not listen to the wise words of his wife though, instead he goes on thinking about the pearl's value, and how much money he could make from selling the pearl. When he goes to sell the pearl he finds out that it is barely worth anything. He thinks that he is being cheated. The book shows how people often go corrupt over money. He, his wife Juana, and his baby son Coyoto run away from the village. They run to the mountains to get away, but they are followed by the town's trackers. They have to try to escape from the trackers in order to survive. It is an amazing story with an unforgettable and totally unpredictable ending."
4,The Pearl,"I'm a sevy (13-yrs), yes, and we read this novella in school. I thought it was going to be boring, but I randomly loved it. It is a sad story of hope, greed, and despair that is fantastically writen. Steinbeck does an outstanding job to describe Kino's animal-like behavior. There are a few minor bores, but it turns out to be a great novel or novella.4/5 stars (A-/B+)"
3,A bit dissapointed but.......,"I bought the Pearl for my son, its a book I used as a child and I loved it. The book was used but I thought it would have been in a better condition, the pages were discoloured and the book was pretty old, The cover was not the one advertised. All in all, I did purchase a used book although the reading is still the same, old or new, I was hoping the book would have been in a better condition. As much as I was dissapointed,I think I would still give it a go and purchase again."
4,The pearl,"Purchased book for grandson. Delivery took longer than I expected. He needsed the book for his summer reading program .I was surprised at the size of the book, it was not as I expected . Thank you"
2,A TOWN'S GREED,"This book ""The Pearl"" by John Steinbeck is a story about a family of three that live in poverty but they have thier morals to live by. On one tragic day Kino and Juana's son Coyotito got stung by a scorpion. For them to be able to pay a doctor for a cure, Kino and his wife Juana went in search of a pearl. After they found what was said to be ""The greates pearl of the world"" every one in town wanted part of it. So greed aroused in La Paz. Kino's family was attacked and tricked. Accidents,murder,rage and drama happend throughout the book.I gave this book two stars, because this book I would say is for bigginer readers or for a younger audience. It was an interesting novela. If you're a person who doesn't read much you might find it very juicy and full of suspense."
2,-,"I can enjoy a moral or allegory as much as the next man, but I wanted something more than this from Steinbeck. The novel seemed stripped down compared to his others, like a skeleton."
3,Life on The Pearl,"In my opinion, the author should write more after Coyotito died, how his parent live do they die or they have another child."
3,""" The Pearl "" is difficult book for me.","My name is Hitomi Yamazaki. I'm from Nagano in Japan. I'm an ESL student in the Monterey Institute of International Studies. We read "" The Pearl "" by John Steinbeck in Content class. This book was very, very difficult for me. Because, the book has so many vocabulary words. I don't understand some time and it was difficult reading for me. I read for a long, long time. So I don't hate but I don't love this book.The main characters are Kino, Juana, Coyotito and the Pearl. They are a poor family. They had a problem and they should make money because their baby is sick.The book is difficult. I recommend The Pearl for those interested in understanding the tale of life, but maybe they will need to read it over and over again after so they can enjoy it more."
1,Not Good,"In this book, the theme ""Wealth and Materialism will destroy"" is drilled in repeatedly in ways that don't vary too much from each other. It had a weak plot."
2,Disappointed in publisher...,One of the main reasons we use a Kindle for some of our more challenged students is the Text-to-Speech feature. Being able to listen as well as read makes learning for these students much more complete. I am disappointed that this publisher would not make this feature available for students on a timeless classic such as this.
1,it was WACk.,it was bad i slept through it in class so now i have to read it at home its a bunch of dumb letters
1,Don't read it,This book was very poorly written I think. It was absolutely a boring book. It didn't have any adventure at all. There is no detail so you didn't get a good mental picture of the characters. This book was way too predictable and wouldn't read it if someone payed me too.
1,I give this book a rating of.....gee I wonder maybe a -999.,"I did not like this book at all. It was a big waste of time. I would rather watch grass grow than to read this book again. If you haven't read this book yet, save yourself now while you still can....DON'T READ THIS BOOK !!!!!!!"
1,I hated this book,"This, quite frankly, is the worst book I have ever read. I found it short sighted and much to ""perfect"". There was absolutly no surprize element, the language was prmative, and it was much too unrealistic. If you want to read a good book, do not read this one. I reccomend a more well-rounded steinbeck novel, ""Of mice and men"", ""grapes of wrath"", anything but this."
4,Acceptable,This book arrived with a little smell.Smells like ites been stacked on the shelft or somewhere for awhile.but the condition for book pages are ok. no missing pages so far.
1,"Oh god, one can not begin to describe how dull this book was","Ok, here's the deal with The Pearl, it's AWFUL. Like many of my fellow ""Pearl Haters"" I was forced to read it by school and was ready to shoot myself by page 20. Although the book is very short it seems to go on forever because every word must be read to gain the messages of the book. This book was lifeless, dull and all in all pretty stupid."
1,Dull and depressing.,The pearl in my opinion is quite simply the most boring book ever written in the english language. How anyone can give this book more than one star is beyond me.Choosing between suicide and a second reading would certainly mean my unpreventable loss of life.
1,"Man finds pearl, students suffer over summer break.","I had to read The Pearl this summer. I read it, and I hated it. I've still yet to do an outline and a character description. It was a very predictable book, and it seems to be at a 3rd grade level. But, even a 3rd grader would find it boring. I'm going into 9th grade soon, and please, if there are any teachers reading this, pick an enjoyable book for summer assignments, not a boring book."
1,Do not read this book unless you're ready to go to sleep.,"Well...I can't say this is a good book. I can't say that it's a bad book either because it is somewhat meaningful. Steinbeck is having sypathy for unpreviledged people as usual in this story but still...I wouldn't recommend this book if you're looking for some fun. I HAD to read this book for my english class but I certainly didn't like it. When the teacher was reading it out loud to us, not one person was listening but sleeping."
2,the pearl,"kino and juana were very poor and their litte baby was sick.They were worried because they didn't know how to pay the doctor. They went to the sea and found a pearl that was lucky for them to have and would give the baby life. together, lets see what would happen with the pearl maybe want an bee rich and have alot of money"
2,The Pearl,"This book wasn't very interesting. Kino and his family found a pearl, and then were nearly killed by people who wanted it. You'd think that he would give up this pearl because his family was in danger. Instead he kills several men, and beats up his wife over the pearl. Then at the end, he throws it into the water after being followed by people who wanted to take it from him.This book was filled with wicked and greedy people. It was also very dragged out and full of sarcasm. I wouldn't recommend reading this book."
4,"I thought it was boring but intersting, here is the report!","If whoever hates to read, or is just to lazy to read this book, then email me and i will give you the whole report for free. I needed help like this before on another book and a bunch of people came through for me. Thanks. :-)"
1,The Pearl: The book you would want to read last,"If you haven't read it, don't. The Pearl has no point. Who cares if a poor indian guy finds a little ball of white compacted sand? READ SOMETHING ELSE! You want to know why they gave it an award? Becase it's the book most middle school students are forced to read but loath!"
1,The most boring book I have ever read,"I have read some bad books in my time, however this takes the biscuit. Don't read it unless you are on a long plane journey and are suffering from insomnia. It is so dull,dull,dull that you will want to jump off the plane if you wake up and have to start reading it again."
1,Don't read this book unless your teacher forces you.,A boring story with no action and an uninteresting plot line
3,Another good novella by Steinbeck,"A poor pearl diver, Kino, finds a priceless pearl. This novella shows the greed of man and the power of the woman. He finds the pearl of the world just to throw it away."
5,"""The Pearl"" by John Steinbeck is the best!","This is the best book, I've had ever read, it's full of action/suspense/and sadness. I encourage anyone of different ages to read this book, because it's very interesting, and exciting."
3,"Hard to understand, but interesting",I liked this book becuase it was interesting and a challenge to read. This book tought many morals and lessons valuable in everyday life. I encourage more people to read this book.
4,The power of Evil,"This short story is nothing short of excellent. Kino a poor pearl diver has a change of luck when he finds a valuable pearl in the ocean. Soon his life is changed but with his increase in wealth and luck comes the Song of Evil, his family is [in danger] by his good fortune of finding this pearl. The story is well crafted and reads like a parable. Steinbeck is telling his audience something with this story, how do you interpret it. Check it out!"
4,The Pearl,"KIno, a poor diver, found a pearl the size of a seagull's egg,and it changed his life forever. He was happy and wanted to buy a nicer house, clothes, cure his son, and send his son to school, but the pearl made him get greedy and he started liking the pearl more than his family. He went to the capital to sell the pearl for high price, but on the way trackers killed his baby. Then Kino Juana went home and threw the pearl into the ocean.This book is a good book because the desciption is perfect and the plot is just incredible. There were many "" symbols"" in the story which was exciting because it hooked me into the story."
3,The pearl,The book The Pearl by John steinbeck was not very exciting to me because of Juana and her thoughts about not wanting to keep the pearl not even if it was only for the sake of her husband Kino who thought ot ment a lot to him and his very own son as well. I agree with kino for wanting to kepp the pearl and for thinking that if it wasn't for it his son might of been dead. What really gets me confused though is why doesn't his wife see that and at least support his ideas and let her husband keep the pearl. I agree with Kino because if that would happen to me I would sertainly love to keep the pearl as well. It would of been a sigh to me as of why my child is still alive and why the doctor actually chose to help me.
1,"If there was a -0 star, that is what i would give it!","Aughh! Have you noticed that everyone had to read this book for an assignment in 8th grade, i had to read it in sixth! Want my opinion? This book couldn't be worse; don't even use it as a doorstop; it'll scare away your visitors. I agree with the other ""pearl haters"" anyone who reads this must be fully caught up with their sleep not to drowse off. I had to listen to it aloud and, i'm not kidding, i fell asleep!! No kidding! Okay, okay, 'nuff said. Just that DO NOT GET THE BOOK UNLESS YOU NEED FIREWOOD! Got it? Okay, if i see another person buy this book, i know the world has problems."
2,Don't read if it's not for school!,"I had to read this book for language arts class, and in the beginning it was awful. There was almost NO dialogue, which annoyed me...because I like when characters have conversations. The more I got into the book, there was a little more dialogue. The book is so small at only 90 pages, although the pages are fairly long...but still, it was a short book. In my opinion, I would NEVER recommend this book, unless you HAD to read it for school. It did not end at all how I expected, and the ending quite frankly upset me. It seemed like a waste. Sorry, but I really didn't enjoy ""The Pearl"" by John Steinbeck."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed to discover that the first 26 pages of this book was missing! Had I known, I would not have purchased. Buyer beware."
2,The Pearl,"While this wasn't the most boring story in the world, I found it exremely depressing and tedious. I think that Steinbeck has well-developed characters and uses complex human emotions and responses, it may not relate to a lot of people and seemed unrealistic."
4,The Pearl by John Steinbeck,I recommend this book to all readers because it was a good story and it was a exampel of how people can be with power. this book was not a dificult book to read i could under stand most of the words they werent to dificult to understand the grammer.
1,Guy finds pearl then his kid gets killed end of book.,I had to read this book for a english assignment. We were forced to buy the quite small book for five dollars. I read the book that night in an hour or less. It was not worth the money or the time I spent on it.
1,dull and boring,"I am in grade nine and was literally forced to read this book by my English teacher. It was dull, boring, and too wordy. It has several run-on sentences for an appraised author, and it shouldn't be considered a book for a student who is supposed to be learning NOT to be using run- on sentences to read. It does have a shocking, unexpected ending, but don't choose to read this book- only read it if you have to."
3,the rating of pearl joelle schintzel usa,this book was okay. it could be better. there was too little dialog. steinbach used a good plot and made it a bit dull. the description was outragous and a good style. coyotito should have been added more and it would of been better if it were a bit longer. the action doesnt happen till the end and right when it gets good the story ends. the suspense in each chapter is huge and I reccomend this book for people who like violence description and suspense.
2,pearl,i found the pearl quite dull yet sometimes ok. there was not much dialouge and the characters didnt evolve. if it was longer maybe this could happen. so in my opinion this was a bad book but it was not terrible. I do not like the style of John Steinbeck and thought that this book could be more eventful. the one thing I did enjoy about the pearl is its descriptive detail.
4,The evil town,"""The Pearl"". Is a novella by John Steinbeck that takes place in Baja California, mexico, in a littel town name La Paz. Kino, the main character, is a poor fisherman like everyoen in the town. Everyone was happy in the town but the odyssey started when Kino fownd a pearl. A pearl that promes a better life for kino and his family. But as Kino fownd this pearl everyone in the town become greedy and evil, everyone in the town wanted a piece of the pearl. The only solution for Kino was to sell the pearl. Will Kino sell the pearl and finally give a better life to his familly or will Kino and his familly get destroyed from the greedines and evil of the town?As an ESL student i like this book because it is very short and easy to read. Also this book can teach you some morals. Ilearned from this book that ""it is not good to want something too much"". I guarantee you will like this book if you read it"
3,The Evil Pearl,"The Pearl by John Steinbeck is a short novel that takes place in Baja California, Mexico in a little town called La Paz.Kino found ""The greatest pearl in the world"" to cure his littler son Coyotito who was stung by a scorpion. Kino's wife Juana wanted Kino to sell the pearl to get money and to cure their baby. When everybody in the town knew that Kino found a pearl people from the town got greedy, corrupt and there was no peace in the littler town. Juana wanted Kino to throw the pearl back to the sea.Did Coyotito get cure?Did Kino sell the pearl or did they throw it back to the sea?Read the book and find out.As an ESL student I give this book 3 star and recommend it.The Pearl is an easy book to read because it has many similes, metaphor and is easy to understand.Also I leaned that money change people no matter what need You have."
4,The life of a poor fisherman.,"""The Pearl"",is the story of a poor fisherman named Kino who decided to look for a pearl after his son coyotito got sick.When Kino and his wife Juana found ""The great pearl of the world"" most of the people in the town begon to be jeleaus about him.It is ironic because the name of the town is La Paz and after they found the pearl a lot of conflicts started to happen there.Read the book and find out how this pearl changed Kino's life and the life of the people around him.I totally recommend this book because it shows how money can change people's personalities and how ambicious a person could be,just because of money.I think this book is also very interesting,exited and capture the readers attention.Beside,it is also good as a material work for school."
4,""" The Pearl ""","THE PEARL, BY JOHN STEINBECK TAKES PLACE IN A SMALL FISHING VILLAGE IN BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO. IT IS LIKE A FARMING REGION WHERE KINO, JUANA AND THEIR SON COYOTITO LIVED. COYOTITO WAS STUNG BY A SCORPION, SO HE HAD TO BE CHECKED BY A DOCTOR, BUT THE DOCTOR DOES NOT WANT TO HELP HIM BECAUSE HE IS POOR. ON DAY, KINO BEGINS THE SEARCH TO FIND THE PEARL THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO MAKE MONEY, SO THAT WAY THEY COULD PAY THE DOCTOR TO CURE COYOTITO'S WOUND. UNFORTUNATELY, KINO HAD FOUND THE PEARL, IT BROUGHT MANY PROBLEMS THAT AFFECTED HIS LIFE AND HIS FAMILY.I RECOMMMEND THIS BOOK, BECAUSE IT IS VERY INTERESTING AND HAS A HIGH CLIMAX BECAUSE AS YOU READ IT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT."
3,The Symbolism of the Pearl,"I thought the book was good,but not as good as i thought it would be, because at the end when kino finally decides to get rid of the pearl they don't end up living the way they used to live,now coyotito is dead and its because of the pearl. The only thing kino wanted for his son is for him to be able to go to school and learn how to read and write.He wanted to give his wife the wedding she's always wanted. Kino wanted to do many things with the pearl, but at the end his dream turned into a disaster because behind the symbolism of the pearl was greed and evil."
2,a great author at his worst,"I read this book several years ago and didn't like it. Unfortunately it was the first Steinbeck book I read, and boy was it a bad first impression. Little plot, mundane prose, and boring characters. More recently I read ""of Mice and Men"" and thought it was one of the most wonderful, well thought out books I have ever read. ""The Pearl"", on the other hand, reads like a story Steinbeck wrote in two hours on a Saturday afternoon because he was bored. If you want to read Steinbeck, read Mice & Men. Skip the Pearl.(two stars only because it was written by Steinbeck)"
3,A story we all can learn from.,"After reading the Pearl by John Steinbeck, it reminded me of how greedy people can be. The pearl is an awsome story that perfectly illistrates the great lengths man will go while motivated by greed. I believe that the love of money is the root of all evil and that John Steinbeck had this in mind when he wrote the book. It brings the reader to a world within our own and shines the light on our own greed and the greed of others. After you read this book, I guarantee you'll be alot more careful and aware of the greed that surrounds us all."
2,"Just okay, not his best...","This book is not one of his best books, like the pony and Of Mice and Men. If you like these books, enjoy it! HE does write well, i must say."
2,"Not the type of book a ""NORMAL"" person enjoys","I, like many other teens have been forced to read this book by my English teacher. This book used the word ""and"" so many times that I nearly went insane! Not only that, but the vagueness and completely off the point story-line makes it impossible to get really into the book. Although I must say that the one highlight was the very end because it was surpsising and for once actually interesting, although it should've been more detailed. I would recommend this to only the type of people who enjoy reading a book for the descriptions."
3,About a pearl diver who finds a great pearl,"The Pearl is a book filled with deceit, action, and drama. The book revolves around a very large pearl that was found by a very poor pearl diver. His son gets killed, his house gets burned down, and his boat damaged. This book overall was not great at all to just pick up and read. Although it was great for a highschool like myself who needed a short book to read for a report."
2,umm....,k so this book was okay...but id take a good mystery book any day! it has some good point but it was a bit borin...but i think this book is more for older people and not for like us teens...i mean im 14/f and sorry to say i realllyyy thought this book was borin...i readi it in 7th grade and i cant remember anything (so i kno itz outright boring) definately suggested for older people
3,The Pearl,"On scale of 1 to 5, I would rate The Pearl by John Steinbeck a 3. The first part, when Kino found the pearl was good, but I did not like the next part. When Kino, Juana, and their baby Coyotito escape the village, I did not like that their adventure in the desert and mountains was so short. I also did not like the ending of the book. Overall, the book was OK, but I would not suggest it to someone who likes adventures or someone who does not like sad books."
4,"enlighten us with ""DO NOT SAY ANYTHING RELATE TO MONEY""","This is a book for who doesn't like money much. In the book, Kino's pearl brings only devil to his family. It's normal a man imagines how his futre is so bright when the man has a great deal of money on his hands. But <<The Pearl>> tries to prevent us from greeding money using a sad ending that Kino's son, Coyotito is death.////////// i am enlightened not to be a greedy person. i'm enlightened to beware of other's evil eyes and evil mind if i have much money. i am enlightenedwith that money isn't everything in the world.////////// However, these could be innocent thoughts in this country because money is the basic enery for people's hard working. May be it is the reason that <<The Pearl>> isn't accepted by the community; and the people think the book is boring."
2,Typical of Steinbeck's work,"This book is...okay. If you're into Steinbeck. Unfortunately, I think that after OF MICE AND MEN, the man had nothing new or more to say. Nonetheless, the idea of a precious little bauble like a pearl bringing such tragedy and unhappiness is an intriguing one, and had it been handled by someone other than Steinbeck, it would have made for a more powerful read."
2,The Goodnight Pearl,"If I didn't go to sleep with this book, nothing has ever made me sleep before. No wonder The first book by Steinbeck wasn't a hit. If Night pills don't help you get your zzzz's, this book will. I was assigned to read this book for a class project, and I literally was upset by the beginning, middle and ending. This book was an example of everything you would expect. Nothing to give you suspense. What a bore!!"
2,At first I liked the story then as it went on it got boring.,"The ending of the book left me hanging,well a lot of the book did I hate it when a book leaves me to finish. If John hed answered all the questions in the book then it would of ben better for me. Sorry I am so negative about the book but it is the way I feel."
2,THE VISIONS OF THE PEARL.,"When I was reading this book, it was inspiring, but also interesting. I liked when Kino, went diving in the ocean to find, the ""THE PEARL OF THE WORLD"". This book can also show you how money can turn a man into a very greedy person. It also shows how a family should stick together even if something goes horribly wrong. The Pearl also shows that you can have a Pearl or somthing else worth alot, but if you have excessive greed its worth nothing. Is it really worth losing your family, and freinds over money."
4,Can a pearl bring happiness?,"This short novel by Steinbeck, who won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, is a parable. And readers can get a number of insights into their own lives from reading this short tale. The story is centered in the town of La Paz in the southern portion of the Baja peninsula. The novel is focused on a poor Mexican-Indian fisherman and pearl diver named Kino. Even though he is poor, he and his wife, Juana, and their baby son, Coyotito, are happy. But, on one of his dives, he discovers a great pearl, ""The Pearl of the World,"" and he thinks that all his problems are solved: he and his wife can finally get married in a church, he can get a new rifle, his son can get treatment for his scorpion bite from the unscrupulous doctor of the town, and his son can go to school to learn to read and write. But the pearl only brings him and his family grief and pain. It doesn't bring them happiness."
3,~!~My Review~!~,"Overall, i tought The Pearl was a very interesting book. It kept me attentive throughout the entire book, with the many surprising twists and turns in the stroy. The ending took me by surprise because i wanted everything to turn out good for them. Just as real life goes, it did not have a fairy tale ending. I give this book 3 stars, and would recomend it to everyone !!!"
4,The Pearl,"The Pearl is about a family that is very poor. Their son gets stung by a scorpian and they try to get money so they can save their son. They try to sell the pearl in town but all of the pearl buyers say that it is fake. Somebody attacks Kino the main character and he kills the person that tries to kill him. So they are now on the run trying to get away from the friends of the man who he had killed. He kills another man to get a rifle and to protect his family with. They realize that the pearl is bringing them alot of evil. They go home and try and start their life over, and they decide to throw the pearl back into the ocean where they once found it."
4,CLASSICAL STUFF---AGAIN!!,READ THIS 20 YEARS AGO---JUST---RE-READ IT AGAIN.SCOUNDRELS---THE WHOLE BOOK IS LOADED WITH THEM---KINO INCLUDED. FEEL JUANA'S PAIN TO GET TO THE BOTTOMOF THE WHOLE STORY. GREAT BOOK.
2,Assigned Reading,Had to read this book in the 9th grade....did not enjoy it...at all. Very frustrating...
2,BAD school book,I read this book in 7th grade and I thought it was WAY TOO INTENCE for middle school. Maybe for high school but NOT middle school. It was also incredibly detailed which can be bad.
2,The Pearl Review,"Book title and author: The Pearl, John SteinbeckTitle of review: The Pearl Review, Seth HavensNumber of stars (1 to 5): 3Introduction: The pearl is an enduring and classic fable, sensitively told, in simple and beautiful language.Description and summary of main points: A man finds a pearl and later realizes that the pearl bring fortune, love, and peace. Then shortly after he and his family realizes that you cannot buy any of the things the pearl provides.Evaluation: The man found a pearl, but he realized the pearl gave him luck, fortune, and peace. He showed the pearl to his family and, told them what it could do. Shortly after they realized that you can't buy luck, love, or peace they were forced to get rid of the pearl.Conclusion: After they got rid of the pearl, the family's' love, luck, and peace became stronger and better.Your final review: The pearl was ok but, it's not my kind of book."
4,A Pearl of a Book,"This is a great book. It shows how greed and selfishness can corrupt someone and cause so much trouble. also, it's a tiny book; it's only 90 pages, I read it in a day. But, the downside to this is that you pay 5 dollars for 90 pages when some other books have 400 pages for the same price."
5,The Pearl,I purchased the Kindle version of The Pearl so I could read a summer vacation assignment with my freshman granddaughter. I found the book quite compelling. I thoroughly enjoyed it! (I finisned the book before she did.)
2,Unoriginal Short Story,"This is a very short work, more accurately labeled a short story than a novella, easy readable in 1-2 hours. Its theme is as old as the hills, ""be careful what you wish for, lest you receive it.""Kino and his wife Juana live a hardscrabble existence with their newborn son in a straw hut on the beach, where Kino scratches out a meager existence as a pearl diver. Kino's discovery of ""the pearl of a lifetime"" changes his life over night. Kino imagines all of the positive things the pearl will make possible, while his wife soon recognizes it as a source of evil which soon gives rise to a string of disasters which they struggle in vain to overcome.Again, there is nothing original in what is essentially a parable of untold age. It has been compared in style, setting and theme to Hemingway's Old Man and The Sea, but in my opinion, it suffers by comparison."
1,An over-rated story that benefits only from being short,"This repugnant insult that Steinbeck has slung upon his readers has nothing to recommend it except for the author's name. This short, nasty and brutish little tale is completely predictable, and I expect that this was the case when Steinbeck first foisted this on his unsuspecting public. It is only 90 pages, which means that the misery does not go on for too long. Teachers like to assign it, which no doubt helps explain the popularity of television among the adult population. (If this is ""Literature,"" then give me a nice ""ring around the collar"" commercial, please.) Although many people refer to small books as short and sweet, this one would be better described as short and shoddy. Our copy went on top of the junior high school's roof, where it doubtless is now enjoying the lofty station that it deserves."
3,very sad,"DO NOT READ if you are looking for something warm and fuzzy, feel good, and encouraging with a happy ending. however, the book demonstrates some good thoughts on greed and how the sant of money and material things can destroy you. something i think our society needs more of. think lord of the rings type of ""greed destroys"" message. incredible read, but with a very sad ending to enforce some very good morals."
3,The Pearl--Interesting or Not--,"I seem to think that this book was a very wierdly written book. It throws your thoughts one way, but ends up differently. If you like to try to guess what will happen, you will like this book. I though it was a alright book. It keeps you guessing. If you don't like books with an older setting, you wouldn't like this book, but if you don't mind, you would."
5,I rather enjoyed this book.,"Out of all the books my English teacher has assigned me to read, this is the one I finished the fastest. Not just because it's a small book, but because I actually ENJOYED reading, and had no problem reading fifty pages a night. It kept my interest from beginning to end. Even though I was disappointed that no wealth came from the pearl (in fact, something rather AWFUL came from it), I thought the ending was a wonderful conclusion to the story. It was extremely meaningful. I recommend that you read it."
3,It's a good book but it's boring...,"This book actually was not my type of book to read because this book is boring. I like the main idea from this book because the main idea is very clear about poor and rich people. One thing that I didn't like from this book was this book is BORING! Well,that is my review of this book,but every person has different taste in books and this is how ""The Pearl"" seems to me... ^0^"
2,"This book is boring,","but it has a surprise ending. I'm in eighth grade and I wasforced to read this. If you want to read this by choice, CHOOSESOMETHING ELSE!!!!!"
4,The Pearl,"This book, it was wonderful because although it was in the third-person angle, it still showed the emotions of the characters to a maximum amount of understanding for the average reader. It makes it easier for the reader to comprehend what the characters are thinking, whithout being in the first-person spetrum. This book was good because it was well rounded, and it described everthing with detail, without concentrating on every single thing."
3,"Narly dude, The Pearl","This book successfully mirrors human nature as it really is. It related the good and bad aspects of human nature. However the omniscient style of writing becomes a bit annoying when you know who is trying to steal the pearl but not everyone else does, and they are always wondering who the theif is. The author also is unsuccessful in describing the setting of the book. He leaves out the time and country that the story takes place in."
4,Mike's Review,"I feel as though John Steinbeck did a wonderful job writing this book. This story gave real instances that happen everyday to different people all over the world. He did a good job at keeping the book interesting. I was never bored at all throughout the book, from cover to cover. The book was filled with excitement and action. He didn't start the book out with a bunch of boring, meaningless details that no one really cares about. In the end of the book John ends it very tragically with the killing of his son Coyotito. Kino goes through many difficult situations in the book, and selects many different ways of acting in them. All this just shows that money does not mean happiness, and John Steinbeck did a great job at getting that point across in this book."
4,It's OK to read it,"In ¡the pearl¡ was by Steinbeck John. The main characters are Kino and Juana. They live in a brush house with their son named Coyotito near the sea in Baja, Mexico. Their only possession is a canoe. One day, a scorpion stung Coyotito. They don¡t have money to see the doctor so they go searching for a pearl and they find it. A pearl of the world. I will give tow stars to this book because the end is sad. I will not recommend it. Because it is too sad. The pearl doesn¡t bring happiness it brings evil. If you want to know the end. Why don't you read this book?"
2,Too descriptive and not enough dialogue,"This book is meant for serious readers who like the feel of getting into the book. I'm not like that and I like action and stories and plots, not just descriptions."
3,The Pearl,"The Pearl was an extremely interesting book written by John Steinbeck. It is among many of the books I can read over and over again. It was about this young couple and their son in a time of chaos. They suddenly have all this magnificant pearl of rich looking value. It cause so much trouble amon the villiage because everyone wanted it and couldnt have it. So, therefore they learned great lessons. I think it is a book that be read for a very long time."
4,The Pearl,"John Steinbeck wrote The Pearl based on a couple, and their recently born child,Coyotito, living in Mexico. Once I began reading the book, I had a hard time putting it down. The book was filled with many events that held my attention close.This is a great message, and I encourage everyone to read this book and understand the message."
4,Great book but doesn't capitalize on how unfair the world is,"The Pearl, a masterpice by John Steinbeck, is of course what many consider to be a timeless display of how the small minority can rule the vast majority. Kino, a poor Mexican peasant, is happy with his situation. A beautiful wife, a newborn child, and a simple living equate to what to him is a very succesful existence. That is when he discovers the pearl of the world and therefor is shown a doorway into many of the aspects of a ""rich"" life, a life that is forsaken to him by birth. Blinded by ambition and plans for his child, he becomes infuriated with who surround and only when many attempts to his life are made is when he truly discovers that he was happy all along..."
4,OK.......,"I read this book, again, as a requirement for English. I must say, first off, that it's easy wording and lyrical prose made it quite easy to understand. I'm not sure yet, if I actually ""liked"" the book, because it was only the first time I read it and usually the meaning appears the second/third time. I think that I might go and get another Steinback, because I certainly liked the way he wrote. Any suggestions, email me:)Melody"
5,Nice parable,"This a nice retelling of a parable about the dangers of greed. The family was better off before finding the pearl. Quickly-gotten gain is no substitute for honest steady plodding. I was written in an easy, comfortable style as are other Steinbeck books."
4,A Story to make you think!,"I am not exactly sure as to the moral of this story. Kino is a dirt poor pearl diver who suddenly finds the golden egg; the largest pearl found by any of his villages inhabitants, that is. Kino, his wife Juana, and infant son have known nothing but poverty. This discovery offers them a chance to elude their current existance with the potential of good meals, a bed, and the opportunity to send their kid to school so he may learn to read and write. I find nothing gluttonous with this family's simple objective. What alarms me are the swine that jump out of the darkness to strip them of their chance at a new life.Written in 1947, this novella is a not so unique illustration of society's willingness and cunning in stripping others' of what is rigtfully theirs. This is a good family read from which dialog may ensue between parent and child"
5,The Pearl,"The book, The Pearl by John Steinbeck, is an excellent story about how greed can corrupt an innocent man. In the story a Native American man, Kino, his wife, Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito live in an Indian village in Mexico. One morning, a scorpion stings Coyotito. Kino and Juana rush little Coyotito to the doctor in the nearby town, but are turned away because they are too poor to afford the doctor's services. Later that morning, Kino goes diving for pearls and he surfaces with the biggest pearl that his family had ever seen. The rest of the story regards Coyotito's intensifying illness and other people trying to get the pearl. The book has a rather depressing ending but the moral of the story about greed and human nature is extremely apparent by the end of the novel. I highly recommend this book to anyone with two to three hours of free time."
3,Depressing but True,"This is a depressing novel but it definitely shows the true consequences of greed and subjugation. I read this book in English class, wouldn't recommend it to average readers. Too much symbolism!"
2,I think this book is kind of confusing,"I had to read this book for my school. It is about an Indian named Kino who finds this pearl, so he can pay the doctor to treat his son's scorpion wound. He thinks this pearl will give him great fortune, but little does he know that it is evil. He struggles through many tasks until he realizes he should get rid of it."
2,boring,the story was the worst book I have ever had the pleasure to read. The plot made me sick. It was so boring that I feel asleep reading it if I could I would go back and burn all the copies. It was the worst book ever writen. I do not know how they printed it.
3,I thought that the book was boring.,"I think that the book had good descriptions of the characters and events that happened throughout the coarse of the story. I just didn't think that the book was very interesting, and the plot could have been better, but all and all it was a good book, if you like dramatic stories about a family that gets caught up in tramatic and strenous situations. I am more an action/fictoinal type of reader. Though I would read it on a rainy day."
5,Great Writing,"The pearl is full of symbolism, metaphor and irony. It can be read again and again. Each time the reader can find more beautiful language. It is shocking on first reading; on the second and third, the reader can notice how Steinbeck uses his knowledge of the natural life of Baja California and the Gulf of California to illuminate the story. If you were forced to read The Pearl in 8th grade, try it again. It improves with age."
3,"Save yourself some mind-sprain, don't read this",This book would probably only be good for those who like short books and easy reads. My option is that it would be even easier to not read it at all since it has no real plot. How many times can you be stabbed or clubbed and still live?
2,"I read this book as required reading, and didn't like it.","I read the pearl as required summer reading for the ninth grade and must say it was not at all an interesting novel, nor should it be considered a great work. I have always been known as a VERY fast reader, yet the 90 paged Pearl took me 2 weeks. I believe it is simply boring. I do not encourage young readers to read this book, nor old readers for that matter, unless they are trying to fall asleep."
3,I was an o.k. book I wouldn't have read it on my own though.,"I thought the book was o.k. I think I would recomend it. I didn't enjoy it as much because I had to read it for school this summer. I didn't quite think it was as bad as Johnny Tremain, but the good part about it was that it was short. I didn't understand the spirit hooplah though. Overall I thought it was an o.k. book. I would like to recomend ""Gifted Hands."""
1,Pearless,"This is a crazy book. It is so stupid. A man finds a pearl, gets his family, and son into a lot of crud, and then throws the Pearl away. Why doesn't he just sell it for 1,000 Pecos. It is somewhat reasonable. I think that if you want to read one of Stienbecks books, this is not one of his best ones."
3,I don't like this book,"I think that this is not a good book, I don't understand it. I do not recommed people that don't like reading."
1,awful,The books minimal and silly plot got lost in a sea of unneeded detail while the books ending is not satisfying and abrup. The characters are also not relate able and unrealistic the course of action taken was terry hard to follow and the plot was lost Manny times thought the novel.
1,Teachers,"This is a desperate plea to all teachers;DO NOT MAKE YOUR STUDENTS READ THIS BOOK! Have them read Assassin's Apprentice (by Robin Hobb) or somthing good, NOT THIS!"
1,hatred for those who make me read books like this one,"This is the worst book i've ever read,rifles for waddy is of corse the exception. borring borring borring borring borring borring! did i say borring!"
3,this book was kind of boring.....zzzzzzzzz!,"i read this book at school and i really wanted to fall assleep cause this book is the most boring book i`ve ever reed! i recomend you not to read it cause you are gona waste money for a stupid book! the ending of the book left me hanging, well a lot of the book did i hat itwhen a book leaves mefinish. I think this book has no sence at all. dont you ever read this BORING book! it is so stupid and so aufaul! i think this is the most stupid book that john steinbeck wrote! THIS IS A STUPID, BOORIN, AUFULL BOOK!"
1,A SOUL CRUSHING WASTE OF TIME,"Let me preface this with two notes: 1, read anything else Steinbeck has written before this embarrassment; 2, I do not review in with opinions, I review with facts.I would rather have my nose cut off with my own teeth than have to read this dreck again. Steinbeck wrote this rubbish to be made into a hollywood movie, and the hacked cliche ending makes M. Night Shamalas look like a visionary genius who takes risks and doesn't make stupid last second endings that make absolutely no sense.Now Steinbeck is arguably the best storyteller in post1492 America history. Read Grapes of Wrath, Winter of Our Discontent, Cannery Row, the Red Pony, East of Eden, Travels with Charlie, Tortilla Flat, Of Mice and Men, even To A God Unknown, before you even pick up this book if you must. And all you lazy teachers assigning this to their students, for shame, for shame. Hang your heads.Anybody who gave this 5 stars should be gassed."
1,Very Poor,"The book was okay untill the ending, I don't think a more unlikley stiuation could have been created."
3,The Pearl by John Steinbeck Reveiwed by Jamie Eckersley Ashbury College 8A English,"This book is set in a town on the coast of mexico by the pearl ridges that made the king of spain rich. Kino wakes to find a scorpion by his sons head. Kino Reaches for the scorpion but he misses and it falls right into the cot. Kino yells for the villagers to get the docotr but no luck comes to him. So kino goes to the doctor and offers payment with a small pearl but the doctor refuses. Kino Deprately goes out looking for a pearl to pay with and he finds ""The Pearl of the world"". Kino Treis to sell the pealr but he is not convinced at the prices he is offered so he refuses. In the end Kino detroys the pearl to rid the badluck and evil it brought to Kino's family. The good points about this book are that it is well writen and keep you intrest up high . The Bad Points about this book are the ending is not a happy one and that the author descripes certain things in his own opion."
4,"A Good and Short Read, but very depressing","&#65279;I enjoyed this book a lot. It is basically just a folktale written in a novelists viewpoint. It was so short, though, it took me about 2 hours and I thought that it could be classified as a novella.That basic storyline is that a fisherman who dives for pearls finally finds a `perfect pearl', but it may lead to disaster...It was a fun little tale in the beginning, but in the middle and towards the end, it got very depressing and I didn't like it as much as I might have it wasn't depressing. The Bottom line is that if you don't mind depressing stories, and like folktales, you'll like this. Enjoy the folktale!A.A."
2,Marsh student review,"I think that Jon Seinbeck's novel, The Pearl, was interesting. I thought that the beggining led into the story very well and there was a good plot line. It flowed well until the ending. I didnt like how The Pearl ended with Coyotito dying, and Juana and Kino going back into town. I felt like the story was missing something. But i guess that is my own interpretation. Steinbeck was writting more then a story, he was trying to express his beliefs and personal feelings on the matter. I think that the economy at this time also played a big part. It was the end of WWII, and money was a bigger deal to people.I think that the pearl represented a lot money, and kino found the pearl and then became distracted by it and was greedy and didnt care as much about his family. I thnk that Steinbeck had great ideas and should be commended for his work."
4,The Pearl,I liked this book because It took me to a different part of the world and saw what the third world is like for people to have money but have something very valuable. And it was an easy read type of book. I liked how the author made the characters real and I was able to relate to how the characters felt when they where rejected from the doctors because the other person had more money then they did and were not really sickness.
3,the beautiful pearl,"This story is about a family that lived in a town in the north of Mexico. There were three members Kino, Juana and Coyotito. They are very poor and in the story Coyotito got stung by scorpion. Kino was worried and he went to the doctor, but they are denied, because the doctor wanted money but Kino just had some pearls. That wasn't enough for the doctor. Kino decided to look for a more beatiful. Then he found a big pearl. Since that day, his family changed. Kino doesn't stay conformed with the price offer of the dealers and decided to go to the city searching for a better price. That part in my opinion is the most important because Kino and his family fight for what they wanted in a big adventure. This book teaches us not to be too ambitious because it could be bad like what happened with Kino and his family."
2,Not one of Johns best...,"The Pearl is about a man who finds a pearl while diving for clams, and his life gets worse from there. The pearl that he found was bad luck from the begining, and the book only gets worse. Steinbeck descirbes in great detail, but it takes him two to three pages to describe the kitchen sink! Also, the story is very depressing, and if you need an uplifting book, this is NOT the one to read. I have found that almost all of his work is like that, and find it unappealing. Even though, the story has good morals, money is not everything in the world, and the main character in this book finds this out the hard way."
4,Greedy,The Pearl is a timeless classic about how much shame greed brings. It is about an Indian family in the time of Spanish pioneering in the late 1800s in Mexico. They so wanted a fortune that they would do anything for it. One day it comes knocking and eventually tore them apart.
3,a teens view,"the pearl had many interesting themes like music, deceit and pride. i enjoyed seeing how sudden wealth could so drasticly change some ones life. One thing that i really didn't like was how much excessive detail there was. John Stienbeck spent so much time on the underlying themes that the main action and plot often dragged on aimelessly. Also it was kind of confusing and complicated so you had to read it several times to get the point. Over all the pearl is good enough to read when you have extra time but dont buy it unless you love classical and philosophical novels."
3,"Compelling, but boring at times","The PEARL, is a book of many hidden themes it displays class struggle, in that Kino wanted all these material things, but his life was fine as it was he was survivng. He dind't NEED anything else. When Kino realizes this his family is tarnished and his dreams are ruined. The PEARL was supposed to bring wealth and happiness instead it brought, sorrow and despair."
4,The Pearl is an action adventure about Kino and his pearl.,"I enjoyed The Pearl by John Steinbeck because the author keeps the storyline moving with continuous action and adventure. Kino and his family struggle to survive. They live in a brush house near the ocean. Kino finds the perfect pearl of the world. He believes it will bring his family great wealth and happiness. However, the pearl brings out the bad traits of evil, greed, and sorrow for Kino and many others. After Kino has stabbed a man, his canoe and home have been destroyed, and his son dies from a bullet wound, Kino comes to the conclusion that the pearl needs to be returned to the ocean. Kino and Juana, his wife, return the pearl to the ocean in hopes of returning to the happiness of their old world."
2,Do yourself a favor: DON'T READ IT!!!,"As a reader of this book, I found it very, how should I say this, boring. Maybe the only exciting part of it was about the child, the rest was pretty much monotone. I mean no excitment nevertheless interest whatsoever. And all the other books by this author are exactly the same. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
4,This book teaches a couple of good lessons.,"Although this book is small, as many have observed, its conciseness makes its messages easy to understand. The book is an example of how people of certain groups attribute bad happenings to the attempt of changing their position in society. It could also be an example of how peoples' lives change when they put too much faith in material wealth. I think the book teaches excellent lessons and should be read by everyone."
3,The Pearl was kinda ok.,"I had to read the Pearl for an English assignment since I am in 8th grade and in New York State. We read the novel in my Literature textbook & we had to answer questions about each chapter. Personally, I really didn't enjoy it that much. I mean the only thing that really healed Coyotito's scorpion sting was the poultice that Juana made for him. John Steinbeck made a big deal out of nothing. I think that if there was a better ending, that maybe teens, like me, would like it more. But I have to say that the ending was a bit TOO DEPRESSING!! That's my opinion anyway. Some of my classmates liked it a lot, and others didn't. That's why I give The Pearl 3 stars out of 5 stars."
5,Excellent allegory of today's society,"John Steinbeck's The Pearl is an excellent tale of a pearl fisherman, his wife, their newborn son, and the power of greed. When Kito (the fisherman) finds the Pearl of the World, he sees in it a life far better than the one which his family and his people miserably live. Similar in style to Lord of the Flies, in the sense that the general theme is things uncontrollably and inexorably falling apart. The life of Kito and his family becomes far worse than before they found it. Instead of being wealthy and elite, they end up right back where they started, but in worse shape. The parable that Steinbeck tells is a wonderful description of today's greedy corporate society. This is a book that needs to be read many many times."
1,hated it,"This book was the worst book I have ever read. It was depressing, boring, and SO uneventful. I can't belive that my English teacher made our class read a piece of **** like this and I can't believe she didn't find it boring. So unless teachers want to torture their students there is no reason why this book should EVER be read."
1,This Book Stinks,"OK, I had to read this book for school and you know why it stinks. Not enough action and too much description. The book was moved WAY to slow. Another thing is that it is absoultely depressing. Sorry John Steinbeck, your other books were decent, but The Pearl is the worst book ever!"
2,Not really useful,"I bought this book for my daughter. Her 8th grade Pre A.P. Literature class was reading it and the teacher encouraged us to buy our own copy. Well, when we got it, the page numbers did not match with the older version the teacher had. So, her reading assignments did not match and she had to use a copy from school. I feel like I wasted $11. My daughter also did not like the uneven ""torn"" edges of the pages. She said it made it difficult to turn the pages."
2,A LESSON TO BE LEARNED,"Well, this book I really didn't like that much. I liked what it was about but the way it was written was really hard for me to understand. It certainly can't compare to Of mice and men. I gave it two stars because of the lesson that a person can learn while reading it."
1,The Pearl,Tanya WilliamsThe Pearl was the most boring book I ever read in my life. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that like boring books because they wouldn't like it. I would give this book a negative 5000. It was a stupid book!
2,The Pearl,I Didn't Like This Book At All It Is Very Boring Such As I Don't Know Univentful Or Something Close To It Disliked It With A Passion. Do not Recommand
2,"Decent, but only for younger audiences","This book shows the ravaging that avarice can cause a man and his family. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Perhaps it would be, if it were handled by a better author. The story drags along and describes every last movement, with virtually no dialogue or action. The ending was the only good part, because it was hardly expected, but the rest of the book was a huge dissapointment. I hope nobody will read this book for pleasure, because the entire plot could be summarized in just one paragraph. The rest of the ninety pages is unneccessary description that just defers readers"
3,GOOD ENOUHG,"i'M A GIRL OF 15 YEARS OLD THAT LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY, THE BOOK THAT I READ IS NAMED ""THE PEARL"" WRITTEN BY JOHN STEINBECK, TJIS STORY IS FICTION BUT IS VERY NICE STORY AND I SURE RECOMENDED, BECAUSE, THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A POR FAMILY THAT LIVED IN BAJA CALIFORNIA {MEXICO}.THE MAINS CHARACTERS ARE KINO,JUANA,AND THEIR BABY'S CHILD COYOTITO,THAT LIVED IN A BRUSH HOUSE AND KINO WORK AS A FISHER ALSO LOOKING FOR PEARLS THAT WILL HELP HIM AND HIS FAMILY TO LIVE BETTER, THEY MIGHT BE POOR BUT HAPPY,BECAUSE THE ONLY THING TO SURVIVE IS AN OLD CANOE THAT HAVE BEEN ONTHEIR FAMILY FOR CENTUARYS.BUT WHEN KINO FIND THE PEARL THEY WON'T BE HAPPY ANYMORE.BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS FAMILYAND WHY THEY ARE NOT HAPPY ANYMORE WITH THE GREATEST PEARL, YOU SHOULD READ IT,IS VERY NICE, INTERESTING AND ALSO THAT BY READING IT YOU WILL LEARN A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT WILL HELP YOUR WHOLE LIFE."
3,Not that bad,"I had to read this book for a summer reading for Honors English. Althought the book is very short, it felt like it took an eternity to get through the first chapter. It wasnt bad though. In the book, Kino, Juana and their son Coyotito are pretty poor, until one day Kino finds a pearl in the Gulf. And basically after that, Kino is driven crazy from the pearl; bad things such as people trying to rob him, their hut burning down, and the baby was killed, but Kino seems obsessed after a while. He refuses to give up the pearl, which the pearlers said was worthless because it was too big. I found the last chapter the most intriguing. One drawback I found was that Steinbeck describes EVERYTHING in such detail, which probably wasnt necessary. But overall.. I say its pretty good."
2,Depressing,"This is a depressing story of the dark side of human nature. It mihgt be all right if Steinbeck did not insist on describing every detil of the clothing, houses, and waves, but he does, and then some. I don't recommend it."
3,The Pearl,"The Pearl by John Steinbeck was a book about a man, Kino and his wife, Juana and their baby son Coyotito. His family was very poor in Mexico. The story began with the family waking up and finding a scorpion that had bitten the baby, Coyotito, Kino and Juana couldn't pay a doctor to cure their son, so Kino tried to get money. He did this by going under water and looking for a pearl to sell. He found one, a pearl like no other. The conflict is that the pearl buyers thought that the pearl was valueless but Kino disagreed. So he tries to find a people to buy the pearl for a reasonable price. The plot is getting money for Coyotito to live and be cured. The family went through many obstacles to sell the pearl. I would recommend this book to people who like easy, fast reading books."
3,The Pearl,"The book ""The Pearl"" is a story told to teach a lesson or send out a message. Like in this book Kino was one of the main characters. He was not smart and very poor. Then one day he was out diving for pearls, like usual and found a huge pearl. Then all of a sudden everyone wanted to be his friend. I think this book shows how materialism destroys; also that love can give someone a lot of courage (He kept looking for pearls for his son and wife). It shows how people or animals usually go for things weaker than themselves, that knowledge is power which people take advantage of. "" The Pearl"" also shows how dreaming is good until it begins to mess up your life (Kino starts to get greedy and everything begins to go wrong). This book shows and teaches a lot of lessons that actually happen in real life and people learn the hard way just like Kino."
2,Book that has potential but loses it all in the end!,This book is a requirement for new york state 8th grade. we read the book and this is the WORST ending to a book I have EVER read. It is sooooo unlikely almost IMPOSSIBLE read it you will see!
2,"An ""okay"" book","I recently read the book, ""The Pearl"" as an assignment. I thought it was kind of boring, but it did have some strong points. I liked the way that it was kind of realistic, but I didn't like that it had so much description in some parts. It got a little boring when it had too much description. I think there should have been different emtions, not just all depressing and sad all of the time. If you have lost of extra time, then you should read this book, but there are better ones out there!"
2,I thought John S. did a bad job,"I thought he portrayed the characters like they were real people, I like that. on the other hand thats the only thing I liked about this poor quality, written book"
1,This was a boring book!,"I believe The Pearl is a book that could have had great potential, if it would not have been so depressing. I also believe The Pearl was very predictable. In my opinion the author didn't put too much thought into it. I know a 5th grader that could have writen a better novel. Most would say The Perl stunk, well i say to those people, ""Right On."" If you are made to read this book over the summer i will tell u right now try not to read it. If u must, get a review on it and say u red it because it is not interesting. P.S. i am only 12 so pardon my spelling."
1,A Lost Cause,"This book is supposed to show and foreshadow evil of wealth and greed, but many events contradict this and so this John Steinbeck's book is utterly pointless. It is a poor excuse for a moral."
4,THE PEARL,"Kino was a poor man ,he lived with his wifeAnd his son .One day coyotito was trickedby a scorpion and was sick for a long timeand the doctor didn't want to help Kino becausehe dosent had money.Someday Kino caught an oyster in the seaand found a pearl that changed his life inthe society and in his family ,he had problemsand lose many things because he was confuseand he didn't know what to do with the pearl.And he couldn't sell the the pearl"
2,The Pearl and the ending,"The pearl is a book full of anger, sadness and misfortune. the ending added to this. the ending of the pearl was expected by all its readers as steinbeck hinted it to us the whole way through. for example when kino told juana to make sure Coyotito did not cry we immediately think something is going to happen to him. the ending came to a sudden hault and left us feeling confused with many unanswered questions such as who killed Coyotito? i admit i still do not know!steinbeck used his skill to describe nature in a long descriptive way which can bore his readers! and he forgot to give us an understandable and exciting ending instead it was quite perdictable. after so much anger and hurt they threw the pearl away and then suddenly ends! i was expecting some greedy pearl diver to jump in after it! it left me very confused!"
4,Defenetely worth a read,"This book of John steinback is defenetely worth a read,The author was not only able to capure the whole emotion of the characters of kino and juana...but also the surroundings, beautiful!!!...I really like the way he uses "" the song"" paradigm through out this short novel.Defenetely worth your 2 hrs(approximately runs into 100 pages)."
4,The Pearl's Mythical Reality,"I found this book an absolutely mavolus read. It captured the airy and mythical themes of fairy tales, but brought along the harsh reality of real life. This is a tale of a pearl diver's hopeful dream and how it came true, but olny to cause more struggles than before. I would recomend this book to all teenagers as an easy read and a wonderful story."
4,Point Of View-The Pearl,"Hello, my name is Lauren and I am from Hawaii. For my eighth grade G.T. English class, I had to do a book report on classic books and I picked ""The Pearl"".From reading this book, I could relate to what the characters were going through.(i.e. tough times, struggles, and hardships.)But the most important values I've learned from this book are priority, family, and culture.I hope you read ""The Pearl"" and experience the same feelings and emotions I did."
4,A review by Ari,"I think that this book is very short. It's only 6 chapters long and the first 2 chapters were horrible, uneventful and completely boring. From then on, it was okay, until the last chapter, which was truly amazing and very eventful. The last chapter was also quite disgusting. I think that the book needed more dialogue."
2,Sarah Bernhardt Plays the Piano,"Picture a middle-aged silent screen star leaning, half-collapsed, against a table, the back of one hand pressed tightly against her forehead, emoting for all she's worth. That's what the playing of Elizabeth Rich reminds me of. There's a lot of sighing, swooning, calling out in alarm, crying buckets of tears. This reminds me - sans the wrong notes - of the willful playing of Vladimir de Pachmann, the great pianist-ham of yore. In fairness, there is less chewing the scenery in the 'Novelettes' but in 'Carnaval' one hardly knows from one section to the next what is coming. There are languorous moments with wobbly tempi followed by flurries of notes that blur accents, harmonies, melodies.Pass this one up, unless this old-fashioned and highly individual style of playing appeals to you.Scott Morrison"
1,Funeral Parlour Vampires,"The pillars of society (sheriff, doctor, funeral director, ambulance driver) in a small town turn out to be members of the undead. Still alive accident victims are pronounced dead at the scene but are taken back to the A.Lucard funeral parlour where the above's bloodlust is satiated. Why does an old woman who has been turned into a vampire die when hit by sunlight yet the main undead characters walk around in daylight with no ill effects? The undertaker applies mortician's wax to his face the same way people who go the beach apply sunscreen. As if this would protect him from the rays of the sun! Alfred Steinel, who plays the sheriff, deserves the overacting award of the year for his death scene."
2,Good idea...bad movie,"There are a lot of bad things about this movie. Bad filming, bad acting, bad directing......... and you'll be considered bad if you waste your cash on this.I love bad b-movies...but it has to be so bad it's good. This is just bad. Flat. Dull. B A D"
5,grandaughter loves it,we bought this for our 6 year old grandaugter and she loves it ! really easy to learnm and lots of fun moves.
3,overpriced drain overflow,mounts ok. stainless Delta 72020-AR KITCHEN AIR GAP. Used to match a Delta faucet expensive for what it is but ok.
5,Quality Look,"Unlike the other reviewer, we found this item to be of good quality. It looks great with the Delta Touch2O faucet."
4,matches Delta faucet perfectly,"This matches my Delta faucet, found in my other reviews, perfectly. As in other reviews, it is the only thing on the deck that has a white ring showing on the bottom. I can live with it, but is it really that hard to design an air gap that covers the plastic, or the plastic could be black? spray paint or a sharpee should help if you can't stand it..."
5,Looks great,"Recently changed out my kitchen faucet, and needed to update the air gap to match the new stainless. Thought I was just going to replace the cover, but ended up having to replace the whole assembly. No big deal. Looks great!"
1,Cheaply Made Mounting,"The mounting nut stripped while tightening it by hand. Don't even think about putting a wrench to it. This product has the same flimsy plastic mounting as a $6.00 air gap I saw at Lowe's. I thought it being Delta and costing $22 that it would be of sturdy construction, but it is not. The price has dropped significantly since I bought it just weeks ago, but is is still overpriced in my opinion. The satin finish stainless cover matches my Delta faucet nicely, but the white ring at the base is annoying. Overall I am very disappointed with this product."
2,"Delta Faucet ""AIR GAP""made in China I guess????????????????/","PAID BIG MONEY AND ORDERED FROM DELTA SUPPLIER AND IN HOPES OF GETTING A BETTER UNIT THAN AT THE BOX STORES. SAME THIN HOUSING FROM PLASTIC AND THE THREADS STRIPPED JUST THE SAME IN INSTALLATION ON A RUBBER HOSE. GOTTYAFORSURE AGAIN FROM CHINA?????????? CHEAP JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!IN MY NEW $10,000.00 KITCHEN REMODEL.RON FROM TEXAS"
5,complex topic - wonderful book,"This book is beautiful in all aspects. It is very well written, interesting and has great illustrations. The author takes a very complex and many times seemingly illogical topic and makes it both understandable and interesting. We are also given alternative views and told when the state of the art falls short of understanding. I would like to see a second edition in 10 years covering new advances in the topic. One of the best books I have seen in science in the past few years."
2,not so much,"Just finished this book. I did not find the concepts very well explained, and I found the placement of the sidebars distracting; sidebars usually interrupted the regular text, so that as a reader, I had to make a choice to interrupt a train of thought, or to finish the train of thought and backtrack. No big deal, sure, but given the perplexing (yes) nature of quantum reality, those interruptions did not help.Too much chattiness, not enough clarity.Overall, a fairly comprehensible introduction, but somehow unsatisfying. I am still looking for a layperson's guide to quantum physics."
3,"Quick and easy, above average latte, but lacks that real steamed milk taste.","I love the machine, but I do have to say that while the coffees and hot chocolate have been perfect, the latte misses the mark. You just can't get a perfect latte or capuccino without steaming the milk, and while the milk t-disk comes from real milk, it is essentially an evaported milk product, with a few additives, and it has that semi-artificial taste to it. That having been said, this is such a quick and convenient product, if you are willing to skimp a bit on quality in exchange for a quick late with little-to-no cleanup, this is perfect for you. However, I'll be sticking with the crema, coffee and hot chocolate."
5,Latte at home,"EXTREMLY wonderful, the ability to have Lattes at home without much mess. Highly reccommened."
1,Gevalia Works With Spammers,Don't give them any information or your find yourself on a spammer list. They work with spammers.
4,buena historia sobre el arte de mirar al otro,"Esta es una hermosa novela sobre voyeurs, como el título indica, pero también relacionado con eso, es una historia sobre la relación entre realidad y ficción. La novela tiene dos hilos argumentales: uno liderado por el Pintor, que se dedica a observar a los nuevos vecinos que se mudan a la casa que está la lado de la suya, y otra liderada por el Náufrago, un balsero cubano recogido por un buque, en el que los personajes van contando historias. Los dos hilos no llegan a unirse, pero si se van relacionando hacia el final de la obra.Al contrario que en otras novelas anteriores del autor, aquí hay un sentido del humor más marcado, especialmente al comienzo de la obra, lo que hace más amena su lectura. También es más crítica con la situación cubana que otras obras anteriores del autor. Tanto si está interesado en la narrativa cubana contemporénea como si quiere leer una entretenida historia, se la recomiendo."
4,Executive Summary for SQL Server 2005,"If you are an IT manager looking for an ""Executive Summary"" of the new features of SQL Server 2005, you will love this book! It gives you a nice overview of the new features, what they do, and suggestions for how you might apply them.If your a programmer or a DBA looking for details and examples of how to do things in SQL Server 2005, you need to look elsewhere. My recommendation would be ""Pro SQL Server 2005""."
1,Bad luck,After buying these for my girlfriend of 5 years. She broke up with me and never talked to me again. Worst shoes ever...
4,Excellent Value,"These shorts are excellent! Great price and they seem to be quite fashionable for showing up at the local park for a run! Certainly, what you would be looking for if you need to get away from the cotton gear. This will keep you cool for sure and wears remarkabley well!"
4,it works,"it works pretty well, I hauled a pretty heavy beach Cruiser 2000 miles and never had to adjust it except the one time I had to open the trunk. no complaints so far and I have had it for over a year now."
1,Total License Plate Obstruction,"Please note that my review is for a full-sized vehicle, not a van.Although this product does in fact hold a bicycle decently, it also completely obstructs your rear license plate, which is illegal. Let me say that again, using this product the way that the instructions specify will block your license plate, and WILL LIKELY LEAD TO YOU GETTING A TICKET. Having owned many bikeracks in the past, I can say with a high level of certainty that this product is NOT worth the cheap price, seeing as how I now have to pay a ~$200 ticket, on top of the price."
5,Very Handy Device,"Have used it countless times. Very easy to use. Place on your trunk, attach straps, and tighten. Then put your bike on and go hit the trails. U can take it off and put it in your trunk when you are riding, for security. Great invention. :)"
3,Did not fit Mustang GT,Bought this for my father in-law. It did not fit over the spoiler on his Mustang GT. On the back of the box there is a lot of detail on which cars it fits on and which cars it will not. The Mustang GT appeared to be one of the very few that it would not fit. Had I known this in advance I would not have ordered it for him. Looked like a very nice bike rack though. Amazon was very good about taking it back.
3,A little flimsy,"I recently bought and used this bike mount for a 2 hour trip. The bike mount felt flimsy. My boyfriend and I took the front tires off because it seemed like the bike rack couldn't handle 2 fully assembled bikes. We also had to tie the bikes to each other becaue it looked like the bike on the outside was going to fly away when we were going 70 mph. I wish I spent a little more money, but got something a bit more sturdy.Irene"
3,Be careful with spoilers,"Great bike rack for the money. My only critique is that it said it was compatible with 2010 toyota corolla and it actually isn't. Its compatible with the normal models, but with the S model that has spoiler it's not. They should make sure that when they say it fits corolla 2010 that it actually fits all 2010 corolla models. So be aware of this before buying it if your car has a spoiler."
4,Great for the price,"This is relatively compact and easy to use. It did leave a mark on my car - chipped paint a little - this is not an issue for me as my car is 16 years old and has lots of chipped paint, but may be an issue for someone else. It carries my ""beach bike"" and my son's training wheel bike to the park very nicely. Our bikes aren't traditional bikes so usually I can only use one of the docking straps - the other side I secure with bungy cords. I'm very pleased for the price.Oh, also, my car is not a traditional car that carries bikes, it's a '95 Mercury Grand Marquis (old lady car or pimpmobile)."
2,Dangerous,This bike rack collapsed twice under the weight of our two bikes. I'm returning it before it causes an accident.
4,Great for its price,"A great way to find a economic and efficient way to move your bike around the city. I have used it on highway and is very firm. The design is excellent for two bikes, the tie down system is kind of tricky but after a while you know how to use it, and once the bike is tight it won't slip. Also the rack is to wide for Middle size frames like mine, but with the tie down system the problem is solve"
2,Allen Deluxe 2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack,"For the price....I guess this is a good buy, however AFTER using it....It makes me very nervous! It works ok for one bike. But for two...not so sure. I have a mountain bike and my son has a BMX, and when the two bikes are on the rack together it doesn't seem to be sturdy OR roomy enough. His pedals had to go through my spokes......NOT A GOOD IDEA! Easy enough to install but with only having 3 straps to secure it to the trunk of the car made me nervous. I wish I would have shopped around more and did a little more research before purchasing. Would love to return it if it were an option. I really wouldn't recommend this unless it was to transport a child's bike. Spend a little more money, and get something you have ease of mind with while using. I really would NOT recommend this."
4,Good bike rack!,I saw this product on amazon at a cheaper price then here locally so I decided to go ahead and purchase it. Not only was it cheaper I also got a discount on it as well. It was delivered at a decent time I was in no rush for it so it was no big deal. I am certainly glad to have bought this bike rack it works just fine had no issues with it what so ever. I read exactly how to assemble this and to install it on the trunk of the car it has turned out quite nice. I would recommend this product to anyone it works just fine and it's easy to attach and detach your bike from the rack.
3,Works well. Watch for broken foam protectors,"I purchased the Allen Deluxe 2-Bike rack for my sedan about two months ago, and I've used it on multiple occasions and 5+ hour drives. The bike rack is really secure, and I had no worry that the bikes were going to fall off. However, several of the foam pads have broken off. Also, on one occasion the bike closest to the car managed to get under the lower bar and scratched my bumper up pretty badly. Unfortunately it was a long drive, so I didn't notice that it was touching until a few hours later. It's definitely a good bike rack for the price, but be careful with how you position the bikes and watch for breaking foam padding."
5,Good quality at a great price!,Allen Deluxe 2-bike Trunk Mount Rack is a good quality product at a great price. I checked out other bike racks of similar quality which were priced at least $20.00 or more dollars higher. My daughter used bike rack to transport her bike to college 2 1/2 hours away. She traveled on a highway at speeds of 70 plus miles per hour. The bike stayed put through the whole trip. We are very satisfied!
3,Works well but difficult,"I have no problem with the rack itself but it was quite difficult to fit the arms into the slots . . . and taking them out again, for storage was no dream either. We ended up having to use foot pressure to both insert and ""uninsert"" the arms from the slots."
3,good starter rack,I think that this rack is pretty good to work. I just wish it came with 2 more straps for the sides to secure to the trunk. It holds the bikes great but it sways a little to much at times for me.
5,Great addition to my travels,"As a single woman traveling with my cat, I found this carrier perfect. I was able to load and unload my bike easily by myself.Our first trip was to KeyWest and my bike rode solidly on the trunk, even with the top down."
3,Does the job,"I bought this before I bought my bike, just so I would have some way to transport it when I picked up the bike. The fellow I bought the bike from helped me put it on my car and commented on how cheap it was. Yeah, I suppose its nothing compared to the one my parents had when they were hauling around 5 bikes when I was a kid but it gets the job done and isn't too difficult to use. I think it would actually be pretty hard to put two bikes on it."
4,Good value for the price but short trips only,I'm very happy with this product for the price. Once you get it adjusted right it's very easy to put on and take off the vehicle (subaru outback). It works perfectly for my needs - driving a couple of miles with two bikes to my favorite trailhead. I don't think I'd drive a long way with my bikes on this rack though.
5,"works well, may fit Honda Accord if bike(s) weigh below 50 lbs","I was concerned when receiving this and finding on the box that it ""does not fit"" my Honda Accord. I contacted Allen's customer service and their reply was ""While the rack will fit the Accord really well, we have found that on some Accords the trunk hinges can be very weak. According to Honda, the hinges are only rated for 50 LB, and in some cases we have seen where the trunk can pull back from the vehicle if the rack is overloaded."" I only needed to carry one bike (weight=28 lbs), so I kept the rack and used it without problems. It was relatively easy to set up and it worked well."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a great price for a rack, but after one nervous short, under 45mph trek in my car with my bike on this trunk rack, I had to send this back. After following all the instructions for attaching the rack to my car and attaching my bike to the rack, I still noticed my bike bouncing all over the place during my ride. When I got to my destination, I noticed my straps had still loosened quite a bit, and I was too scared to use this rack again. I read another review on here just now that said the rack probably isn't good for long car rides or rides over 35mph, and I totally agree with that. I just need to bite the bullet, spend the 200 quid and get a quality SARIS rack or something."
2,"Poor Quality, dangerous and will damage vehicle","Item is composed of very think tubular metal connected by far to thin of bolts. It was not properly assembled, scratched and dented my car and I returned it as I felt the likelihood of it failing while driving was high.I would strongly recommend not going cheap with something that could cause serious harm or injury if it fails."
4,easy to use but not on a new car,"Its easy to use. I keep it on my car until the season is over, but I can see where it would wear on the paint. My car is older and I am not concerned about the little scratches it makes. If you have a newer car you might want to put a piece of cloth or something under the hooks."
4,Good Enough,"I've only had this for several weeks now and used it for carrying 1 bike on a couple 15 mile trips, but I have not had any issues with it at this point. It is easy to install and the bike seemed secure."
4,Good Bike Rack,"The bike rack has worked well for me. I've taken several multiple hour trips on the highway and through construction zones (w/2 bikes) without any problems. The bottom bar rests right on my license plate so obstructing it from view, so thats not ideal. In general I'm very satisfied."
1,Foam Grips Broke after one use!,"After one trip with two kids bikes, the foam grips that are supposed to protect the car from scratches split in half! Sent this back for a refund."
4,Arrived on time and works,"The product arrived as promised. Attaches to the vehicle easily and supports the bike. I could wish that the bike supports were a bit wider to support an oval frame, but they were wide enough."
4,Fits great on my 2013 Kia Forte,Previously bought the Allen Deluxe Spare Tire Mount for my Jeep. After selling my jeep last month for a 2013 Forte I wanted to keep the same brand. Bought this to use. Fits great onto the trunk on my car. Holds my bike just as good as the spare tire model does.
4,Worked as billed,Went on a 40 mile drive on interstate and some surface roads with a bike strapped to it and it didn't seem to damage the car and it hung on to the bike and car just fine. BMW 321i for the record.
4,Allen Deluxe is awesome!,"I first read reviews before buying this rack, and was hesitant after hearing some people's were bouncing around going at high speeds and long distances. I drove from Dallas Tx to Destin Fl and not once did I have a problem with this rack. Zipped in and out of some traffic on the highways and the rack stayed true, along with the bike remaining in place. I was very surprised how well this product worked. I suspect the only reason others did not hold well was that they were not tied down correctly. The only reason this did not get 5 stars was because the bottom stram did not connect to my trunk or under the car but was still long enough to MacGyver it easily.Overall: Love this rack, easy & quick to install and take down"
2,Watch out for inside bike,"I rode around with one bike on the outside of this rack for a long time and it worked great, especially for the money. Then I started biking with my girlfriend and discovered a severe problem with this rack. The inside bike holder is too close to the vehicle so your bike will rub, bump, and just generally destroy the back of your car. I have a nice car and now there are scratches, scrapes, and a place there the inside bike bumped up and down repeatedly, leaving huge pock marks on my bumper. Even checking carefully before I leave, the inside bike will shift and damage my car. It seriously needs that inside rack to be another 6"" out. If you care about your vehicle, keep looking unless you will only be carrying a single bike."
2,"Great price, poor execution.","I appreciate that Allen tried to put an economical bike rack out there, but at the end of the day it just seems that cutting costs on a device that holds your valuable bike(s) and affects both your safety and that of the drivers around you is just not a great idea.Bottom line: this rack relies on you to tie knots in the straps to hold the anchors in place. This is per the instruction manual. Without tying knots, the buckles WILL slip. I barely made it 5 miles before having to adjust the rack as it shifted, and I wouldn't even dream of ever riding on the highway with this thing. I am returning it immediately, as I don't feel that asking me to tie a knot after the buckle is acceptable for this type of device. My recommendation is to spend a few more bucks and get something that holds securely on its own."
5,Easy to use!,"I have a Subaru Imprezza Outback Sport, with a spoiler. The box claimed that the rack would not fit with the spoiler, but it definetly does!!! Easy to use, fits my road bike and cruiser just fine. Highly recommended!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"This product isn't bad for the price but I should have saved up for a decent bike rack. While entering a parking lot, I crossed a speed bump at 5mph and the plastic buckle snapped in half. My bike hung a bit but it didn't completely fall off. At least I can still carry one bike on my formerly two bike rack. I'm not too confident about it though :-/."
5,trunk bike carrier,This product is great. It came at the right time. We used it for vacation. My children wanted to take their bikes and I have a small car. It was very easy to put on the car. We didn't have any problems with it falling off the car. It will be a great resource for our family.
3,Allen Deluxe 2-bike trunk mount rack,"The rack serves the purpose of being able to transport one bike. The rack is easy to install and easy to secure the bike on. However, I don't think it could be used for two bikes. Also, if someone wanted to they could walk away with bike and rack because no parts of the rack are secured to keep it from being removed from the car. A elastic cord is needed to secure the front tire of the bike during transport."
3,Middle of the Road Bike Rack,"The rack is about 50/50 on good vs bad.The Good:AffordableEasy to use strap tie downs (compared to the rubber kinds).Has no problem hauling 2 bikes.The Bad:Total of 3 straps that secured the rack to your car, not as sturdy as it can be.No extra strap on the cross bar for you to secure the front wheel."
3,good for short term to little use,"Very affordable, which is why i bought it. Now I am really into biking and realize i should invest in a more stable piece. Its great if you are just biking once in a while or only need for short term."
4,Minor Dilemma but Great Product for the Price,"I have a license plate cover so when I mounted two bikes on the rack it smashed the cover breaking it. Minor dilemma for me because not everyone has a license plate cover, however it is a great product for the price. Not safe to leave on the car since it can easily be removed which I don't like that too much because safety is a big issue where we live. (South FL!) And I did have some trouble mounting my mountain bike (24 inch schwinn) its made with the center bar slanted down so it was a little difficult to figure out how to mount without the bike looking lopsided, but it did the job got us to the trails and thats all that matters. I'd recommend this product with CAUTION! But it is a great product, gotta love Amazon and theyre awesome prices thats for sure."
1,Doesn't work well on hatchbacks,"I have an Acura RSX and this bike rack wasn't stable or secure on the back at all. Compatability guide said it fit, but didn't really fit too well."
1,not for all cars or bikes,"We returned this bike rack because of two major problems. First of all, the box says it fits a Toyota Prius, but is very wobbly and seems to put damaging pressue on the spoiler and other parts of back of the car. Secondly, my adult bike fits, but my wifes female model does not, nor does my sons mountain bike. The arms of the rack simply are not adjustable and do not fit all bikes.The quality of the rack seems good for the price. It might work well in some cases, just not for our needs."
3,not easy to set up but functional,"This rack serves its purpose, but it wasn't easy to set up. It required me to look up the tutorial on the website (I'm glad they had that at least), but when I did I realized setting it up would mean bending the thinner metal bars into place. The video made it look easy. It wasn't. If you're jacked, you might have an easier time than I did, but don't be misled by the limp wristed girl in the tutorial snapping it into place on the first try without tears of frustration."
1,my two bikes fell off from the rack on the high way,"my two bikes fell off the rack on the highway. the cost of repair is over $450. such a bad product, such a bad design. this one only has four straps and the bottom two strap at the bumper. I prefer the rack with six straps, which all can be hooked to the trunk, not the bumper. Tightening your bicycles along the high way is once-in-a-life experience. pretty scary. From now on, i will not transport my bikes again by myself."
4,Bike Rack,I purchased this bike rack to transport my daughter's bike down to college in southern California. It works as expected and I would recommend it.
2,"Weak materials, poor design","Pros: Cheap and available.Cons: Weak materials, poor design.The pins used to hold the carry arms out are weak and do not lock in place in any way. They are supposed to use their elasticity to stay in place, but with a two bike load they bend and the whole system falls apart. Even with one bike and following the directions exactly, the straps come loose quickly. It's hard to fit two bikes on the rack in the first place (to be fair, my main bike has an unusual shape to begin with, making it hard to strap on)."
3,Rack gets the job done,"The two-bike rack works fine with one bike, mine, on my Hyundai sedan.When I load my girlfriend's bike, the bottom roll bar moves and we can't trust the rack will hold the bikes securely for road trips.However, the rack works like a charm on my girlfriend's car, a Toyota convertable."
4,Allen Deluxe Bike Rack,"This product is well worth the money. It was easy to assemble & once the bike was on, there was no slipping or sliding. We drove 1,500 miles without any problems at all. I would recommend this bike rack to anyone. Great purchase."
5,wonderful!!!,delivered on time and in great condidition! works just as expected. great design and i like it more than other bike racks. stows perfectly in the trunk when im not using it. Thanks a bunch!!!
4,Works just fine for the Money,"Bought this because I was getting tired of folding the seats down and pulling off tires and seat to throw my bike in the back of my car. The cushions are plenty sturdy to hold up to the weight of two (pretty heavy bikes) and no scratches or dents thus far.I would like to see a better design on the two main support flat-hooks. A more rounded hook would be nice, or perhaps some rubber padding for underneath. I have yet to see any scratches or have any issues with jamming but I'm just being a bit picky.The utility of this product certainly warrants the money spent!!!"
3,Trunk Mount Rack,The Back Rack arrived in a short amount of time. But once I put it together I recognized that the bottom strap that helps to fasten the rack to the bottom part of the rear bumper was too strong for the bumper and thereby causing the bottom part of the bumper to flare out.
5,A great bike rack!,"The Allen bike rack is a great, straight forward solution to carrying a bike on the back of a car. It goes on and off the car quickly and easily. I have been carrying only one bike on the rack so do not have any experience with two."
4,Perfect for the Price!,The price of this bike rack was just within my budget. It was easy to install and just as easy to remove. I drive a Corolla and it fit perfectly. No complaints so far!
2,Too Weak,"First the Pros:Very easy to set upEasy to mount and removeAll one piece out of the boxFree shippingCons:Too weak to hold 2 mountain bikes,Forks have a terrible time with a full suspension frameSpring arms are MUCH too weak, they came out of place will holding 2 bikes on the 101...thank goodness for traffic! Ruined the tire and tube that dragged for a mile. Would only recommend this for 2 kids or 1 men's (road/bmx) and a women's bike...maybe :-/Sent it back and Amazon promptly refunded my $, thanks Amazon!!"
2,"Doesn't work, waste of mney","I purchased this rack one month ago for 2 bikes, I mounted the rack and bikes appropriately on corrolla, pins came off after going for lesstahn 10 miles, since then pins came off immediately after loading second bike, It never worked for two bikes. I purchased this rack after seeing all good reviews about it, I don't know how it is working for others?If you are looking for two bikes do not waste your money on this rack, for one bike it is ok."
2,Need to include description/list of compatible cars,"I was stoked to find an affordable bike rack when i purchased this one. However, once i got it home, and saw the packaging w/ the list of compatible cars, it listed mine as incompatible (mitsubishi eclipse). To add to it, I googled it and couldn't find any information online to confirm or find out otherwise, so i will be returning this."
1,Bad Purchase Dont waste your money!,"After following the directions and attaching the rack to the car and and also following the directions to attach 3 bikes to the car. We drive about 5 blocks only to have the rack collapse on the trunk putting a dent and scratches on the trunk and dragging the bike tires on the street for a block until we were able pull to the side of the street out of traffic.Thank God we were in a 35 MPH zone and not on Interstate 40 where we would have been in about 10 more minutes of driving!We had to ride the bikes a 1/4 mile back to our house for fear of trusting the rack, distroying our bicycles, or further damaging the trunk of my car.The silver support bars that are part of the racks design are worst thing that could have been done. With me putting slight pressure on the rack standing behind the car the silver supports start to slide out of the holes in the black bars."
1,Failure!,A friend of mine just had two bikes destroyed due to a failure of an Allen rack. Just saying I would never buy one.
5,Great Rack,"After reading the reviews, I was skeptical about buying this rack. I took a risk, and it payed off. Sure, the rack isn't a Thule, but the price doesn't rival a Thule either. At around $30 you get an exceptional value. I am leary of putting two bikes on it, because the bikes can get pretty heavy for this bike rack. But for the short distances I drive to the trails to ride, it is worth it and works great for my needs. Friends cannot believe how little I payed for this bike rack. It fits nicely into my trunk when I park at the trails, and it goes on/off in a snap. Realistically, as much of us understand I cannot afford a $200 rack, so this is exactly what I need for an inexpensive way to keep in shape, and enjoy the scenery. I recommend this product, just be smart about how fast you take turns, and the weight of the bikes."
5,Best bike rack for people on the go,Love it! Its easy to setup and easy to take down. Stays in place and perfect for traveling short and long distances with my bike. Folds up! Minimalists like me will love it.
4,"Basic, Simple, Does the Job","This product is very basic, fairly universal, and relatively inexpensive. The simplicity of design makes it very easy to attach (and detach) from a vehicle as well as a bicycle. There is some risk of scratching the trunk with the metal connectors, not ideal. Overall fairly functional and moderately durable with no frills."
3,Good not Great,Arrived promptly and undamaged. Mounted on Pontiac Vibe and Honda Odyssey without problems. Have two women's bikes and they DO NOT mount easily on the rack. The bikes when mounted are in very odd positions due to the fact the women's bikes do not have the horizontal bar found on men's bikes. Requires the use of additional tiedowns to keep the bikes stable. No long trips taken to date but I am concerned about stability overtime on the road. Probably very good rack for men's bikes not so good for womens.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I have had two of these now and took both of them back. The plastic clips used to fasten the bikes to the rack are very cheap and poorly constructed. As a result, I have broken a few of the clips while tightening the bikes to the rack. Maybe I just have Hulk strength and any fastening clip would perform the same way. I just want to have a secure connection so my bikes aren't bouncing around on the highway. I would try something else."
3,Does the Trick,"For the price, you can't complain too much. But this is a review so I'll complain. It only really fits men's bikes (the ones with straight bars, not the diagonal ones). I was able to fit a female bike crooked. The rack moves a lot when driving and the bikes would hit the car a lot. I have an old beat up rolla so I don't mind. But if you can afford a new car, I would recommend you buy a hitch rack. If you are like me and have a old beat up car and like biking, i recommend this baby."
2,Need adaptor if your wife actually has a woman's bike,"I ordered this rack and decided to use it today. It fit my car pretty well, and installed easily. I hung my bike on it, but couldn't figure out how to hang my wife's bike on it. Women's bikes do not have center posts - um, duh! This rack does not work for bikes without a center post. You have to purchase a separate adaptor, the Allen 900B. So, this really messed up my day. We weren't able to take the bikes to the state park as we had planned, all because Allen didn't realize that a typical couple might consist of a man and a woman, and the woman might actually have a WOMAN's bike. Very frustrating. I've now ordered the adaptor (which should come with this rack if you follow my drift) and in a few days, we'll be able to put both our bikes on the rack."
4,Great Bike Rack,"I recently purchased the Allen Deluxe 2-Bike Rack and for the price, this product is exceptional. The most difficult part of the entire process was opening the box (that's some tough glue on there). It was quick and easy to install on a Honda Civic, and I know it'll be just as easy on my Volkswagen Rabbit, maybe I'll give it a whirl this weekend! Great design, great function and great price."
4,Worked great,Worked very well on a 2011 Equinox. Carried a man's mountain bike and a kids bike with no issues. Traveled in two hours (mostly highway) without any problems.
2,Not for all cars,"This rack may work fine on some cars, but did not work on our 2007 Buick sedan. On the box there is a long list indicating on which cars the rack works and on which it does not. I am not sure if there is a way to find out in advance if the rack will work on your car. Fortunately for us, the rack was returnable under Amazon's return policy."
3,"Does the job for the price, I wouldn't install it on a new car","This bike rack does the job for the price. I wouldn't put it on a new car though, it isn't extremely gentle to the paint or body but satisfactory if your not a car worshiper. I like the fact that the plastic piece that holds the bike turns. My 29er will mount good because the piece turns. The straps do seem to come a little loose after driving a while, good idea to secure them after pulling them tight."
3,Worked well on sedan; not on hatchback,"I purchased this rack when my family had two sedans (Subaru Impreza sedan and Honda Civic). Then, I replaced the Civic with a Honda Fit, which is a hatchback, and after trying quite extensively, could not get it to safely attach to the new Fit. Therefore, we've continued to use it on the Subaru Impreza, until we had to get rid of that car as well (we decided that we no longer need two vehicles). Therefore, we're now in the market for a new rack. So my conclusion is that this rack is appropriate -- relatively lightweight and easy to use -- if you drive some sort of sedan. But if you have a hatchback or an SUV, it is not a good choice."
2,Fell apart within days.,After using the 5 mm wrench a few times it pulled apart. The ball allen stayed in the bolt and the socket end stayed on my wrench. Really sad for high priced tools.
4,excellent instructional video set,"I borrowed the first video from my library and really liked it so I decided to buy the entire set. It is easy to follow along, especially when telling you how to position parts of your body for each pose. It's great for becoming more flexible - I am a runner and it is helping other areas that I neglect. I do agree with another reviewer that you do have to be 'in shape' to do this - you should be involved in some type of exercise."
4,Good for keeping your postures correct,"The tapes are good for reviewing your postures if you do not attend classes and learn yoga on your own. Natasha presents clearly and her directions for good postures are clear and easy to follow. I wish the practice sections were at least 30 minutes instead of 20. Some days I just want to practice, and the practice flows are a bit too short for me. And the instructional flows are too slow if I do not want to review my postures. But it is definitely worth having on my shelf and has helped me improve my form and my practice."
2,Not for beginners,This yoga dvd is not for beginners. It requires that you be in really good physical condition and should state so before purchasing.
2,Don't Let the Title Fool You,There is nothing beginning about this DVD set. I was really disappointed. The instructor is way beyond advanced and does nothing to help the beginning yoga student. I sent my DVDs back in for a refund.
3,Great for teaching about Communities Around the World,"I always use this book to launch my third grade study of communities around the world. It is beautifully illustrated and teaches students that although we may live ""differently"" from one another, we are all very much alike. This book in combination with Julius Lesters', Let's Talk About Race, is a perfect model to teach children about culture, race and ethnicity."
4,Good,"I think this book has good points. Honestly I think the pictures are a little creepy looking. And my five year old argued about some of the points in the book because he didn't really understand, ex: We are all the same. I guess it's good for opening topics of discussion with your children though."
3,"disappointed, not what I expected",My daughter is a Pre K student at LSU in Baton Rouge and looking forward to reading to children in her classroom. Mem Fox is her favorite teacher and we have given Ten Little Fingers as a gift before. I purchased all of your available Mem Fox board books as her main Christmas surprise expecting each of them to be the same size. Nothing on your web page indicated that the books would be too small for classroom use. Pls consider listing size in your description.
5,Great Book!,My 2 1/2 year old loves the book... I change the words on the blood page to boo boo for now and she thinks the book is great. The pictures are cute and the story is real.
3,Great message,I got this book because of the message it gives about differences in people. It is also multicultural which is a big plus. The language used however seemed to cause my preschoolers to lose interest about halfway through.
5,Oh what a wonderful book this is!,"There is nothing better in the world than to read such a meaningful and delightful story to a group of pre-K and Kindergartners. It's one of a series of books I'm using to teach compassion and tolerance to my class. I could not be more happy that this is a part of my new extensive library. And it was something I had to get as one of my newer students had a serious nationality complex that drove me crazy in the classroom. If there was one thing that this book did very well, it was to break down that inane cockiness that this kid had. Mem Fox writes in a way where the reader can feel the gentleness and compassion of her words and message. This is a message that should resonate with every living being on this Earth: that we are all the same regardless of where we are from, how we grew up, and how we look like. This is a book certainly worth getting and using in all classrooms."
5,spontaneous purchase and just what i needed,"as most tarot users will tell you, they have more than one deck that they use and i am no exception. it is true that each deck has their own feel and, dependng on the moment of a reading, one will gravitate to the one that calls in that moment. this is a most unique deck. while some are put off by the extra cards in the deck, i feel they work, especially since there is such obvious care in the deck's creation. some have also criticized the art on the cards. i say that it is a very personal opinion and obviously, what works for someone may not work at all for another. at first i was a little disappointed myself until i started using the cards. then the explanations in the book and the cards themselves all came together. i could feel a very different and refreshing energy about these cards and they were, and are, just what i needed."
5,Amazing,"For those studying Kisma's branch of Faery Wicca, I highly recommend these! The art is beautiful, and the connection is strong."
1,A load of old blarney!,"A boxed set of 83 cards, quite nicely drawn and containing ogham symbols and- inexplicably- Norse runes. But, and this is a very big but, the Gaelic translates as gobblydegook, as does the author's view of Irish history and lore, seemingly cobbled together fragments and tatters from various sources. Being Irish myself, I take great exception to this American Disneyfication of our traditions. Faery wicca seems to be more of a sales ploy than an accurate description. It is an American invention, not a genuine Irish survival."
1,Oh this is horrible!,I absolutely hated this deck. I think the artwork is just... plain horrible. The only card i really thought was decent looking was the one conveiently used on the cover of the box. Some of the cards are just downright painfull to look at they are so bad... I took them back within a half hour of buying them. Not recommended at ALL
1,Wheres the Cards?,"I ordered this book online at Amazon.com. I thought the first couple of chapters were pretty good. But where are the cards? This is a book, they don't even provide you with pages you can make your own xerox copies of the cards.Unless you happen to be particularly talented as an artist and have time to create and paint your own cards I would recommend getting a book that comes with a deck you can get your hands on."
1,Useless Without Table of Contents,"The Kindle edition is very disappointing - it has no Table of Contents.The actual book's Table of Contents is lengthy and divided into the mythologies of many places. The Fairy Mythology isn't the sort of book you read cover to cover, but read in small doses, or to look up a particular myth. That's impossible in this edition.I'm holding on to my dtb until a table of contents is added."
5,Mariah Carey Is The Best!!!,I have always loved Mariah Carey & I have been a huge Fan of her music ever since 1994.She has a great Strong Beautiful Vioce.She kind of sounds like Whitney Houston & Celine Dion.Mariah has been sining for many years & I think that she will keep on continuing singing.Mariah Carey has it going on!!!
5,Great CD for new MC fans,"Mariah Carey is the biggest selling female artist in history, and what other way could be better to chronocle her career than releasing a greatest hits CD?When compared to other greatest hits albums, this CD couldn't even hold a candle. sony did a pretty lousy job on the production of the cover and the inlay is a pure mess, I bet that they'd do a better job for J-LO when she releases her greatest hits CD, AS IF!! But still, this CD is a great combination of old and new Mariah and is a must have in every collection as the music content is will arranged and covers the diva's history.In this CD you'll find all of MC number one records plus other singles chosen by the diva herself as her personal favorites and some songs picked also by Mariah that didn't get released as singles that are on her albums."
3,not a very representative greatest hits,"how can fantasy not be on this CD? What about the hits and brilliance shown in Rainbow? I suggest forgetting this CD exists and buying #1's instead if you want a Mariah greatest hits CD, or better yet buy all her albums."
1,FOR THE FANS? WHAT IT'S DIFFERENT?,"This is truly for people who don't own Mariah's albums or the #1's collection, this album does not include nothing new, nor even edit versions, remixes of the hits, only a lame version of the xmas joint ""All I Want for Xmas is You"", the only good thing is that they included all the singles cover photos, but after that, you can find all this versions on their original albums releases, wich is more worth it!"
4,a great cd even if she didn't want it out,"This C.D. is really good it contains all her greatest songs. People keep moaning and moaning about her only releasing her #1's a few years ago and that she just after more money. SHE DID NOT HAVE A CHOICE IN IT!. Her ex record company released she could not stop it, so when you insult Mariah Carey get you facts right!!!!!The songs here are brilliant but the selection is not too good do we really need a SoSo Def remix of All I want for X-mas?. Also it lacks all the singles she released and brilliant remix's. Like ODB on Fantasy, I still believe, My all and Thank God I found you. Prehaps Sony will release the remixs album and you can blame her for that as well! This album has not had the sucess it should have had for the best selling female of the 90's but it is a brillint album but lacks all her greatest hits which is why it gets only 4 stars instead of 5"
4,Complete Columbia Collection,"For some reason, Mariah Carey is very fond of the Monarch butterfly as are many female entertainers.Greatest hits features all her hits and single releases with Sony/Columbia making this one the best buy among all her compilations. All her Sony number ones and her duets with Boyz 2 Men, Whitney Houston, Joe and 98 Degrees are all here.I much prefer the pop stuff on this than her current hip hop/R&B; ditties. If you haven't got this already (gasp where have u been?), check out the international version. On top of the 28 standard songs, Sony has added a bonus track featuring Mariah on a duet with Westlife on Phil Collins' Against All Odds. A must have collectors' item if you are into Mariah."
3,Mariah.... For Better or Worse,"Mariah Carey shows no boundaries in her music. This second greatest hits collection, is a bit more surrounding, other than the #1's collection of 1998. Although to me, her music is still the exact same sound.The songs are arranged a bit more here. Not everyone was a hit, but as long as the mood seems to be right. All 15 number ones, and a voice that still remains a constant in the music industry, has still put Mariah on top of most of the music industry."
4,"Excellent, but a couple of songs left out","This album has every song Mariah has released up until the Rainbow album with the exception of ""Breakdown,"" ""The Roof,"" and ""Crybaby."" Breakdown was probably her best hip-hop collaboration to date, so it's sad it's not on here. If these songs would have been on the album I would have given it 5 stars. This album is great for those who are just casual fans of Mariah and only want the hit songs. Huge Mariah fans should also get it to: 1)just have it in your Mariah collection (if you don't mind spending the money), 2)to have the wonderful ""Endless Love"" duet with Luther since it was not on any of her albums, 3)to own some of her older work if you just recently became a Mariah fan, because this is classic, and 4)if you bought Mariah's albums on tape, you might want to get her great songs on CD, and buying the greatest hits album will be less expensive."
4,nothing you haven't heard before,It's truly nothing you haven't heard before. Pretty much the same as #1s except with non number one hits included. Don't waste your time reading reviews. I'm sure you've heard all the tracks on the disc already. ...
4,good!............but..................something's missing.,"this is a pretty darn good album. i only have 2 complaints about it, which are, 1 the video version of someday isn't on here. instead the album version is here. the video version has a drum machine solo whereas the album version has a guitar solo. i've never found the video version on cd / cassette / lp and i've gone bonkers looking for it. complaint 2, i don't know why all i want for christmas is you is on here. don't get me wrong, it's a good song but, to me holiday music doesn't quite fit it. you'd only listen to it x-mas time. to me it's pointless."
3,well....,"Well it's a decent compilation, but kind of disappointing. For one thing, a good number of singles are missing. ""Never Forget You,"" and ""Breakdown"" aren't here--and those are 2 of her best singles. Also, some B-sides and remixes would be nice. Without them, this is just an expanded version of #1s, which is kind of useless considering #1s is cheaper. Maybe they'll do with her what they did with Celine and release an add-on...till then, take it or leave it."
5,Greatest Collection of the Greatest Artist,"To the 12 year old giving her 1 star, you never should have written that review in the first place. Not to mention you aren't old enough to understand how great of an artist Mariah is. This CD is an incredible compilation of her greatest songs, and I highly recommend this purchase to everyone! As soon as my credit card comes in the mail, I'll be ordering this lickety split! Also makes a nice gift for the girlfriend!"
5,VERY GOOD SET OF SONGS!!!!!,I LIKE THIS ALBUM. IT CONTAINS ALL OF MY FAVORITE SONGS BY MARIAH CAREY. THIS IS A REAL NICE SET OF HER GREATEST HITS VERY NICELY PRODUCED. MARIAH HAS A VERY NICE VOICE I ENJOY THIS ALBUM IT IS VERY NICE.
4,Great Collection Until You get to....,"This Mariah collection is wonderful until you get to the latter material. I think when she left her pop fans behind and became a hiphop princess, she lost her way. Great stuff up until the last two cds."
2,Swing and a Miss,"I am Carey's biggest fan, I own over 56 singles, imports and albums combined. Trust me, buying this ""greatest hits"" collection is a waste of twenty bucks. All the tracks previously released, (there are no live versions, good remixes, new songs, or remastered tracks), lets face it, we're all bored to death with ""I'll Be There"" ""Hero"" and ""One Sweet Day"". Carey said she released the album to give the light of day to unpopular tracks that she thought were worth hearing, but she still managed to leave off tracks, such as ""Breakdown,"" ""Whenever You Call,"" ""When I Saw You,"" ""Til The End Of Time,"" and ""All I've ever Wanted"". Save Your money, burn these song if you want a ""Mariah Mix of over-played songs"". If you want new Mariah buy ""Glitter"", or her latest ""There For Me"". If you want great Mariah buy the ""I Still Believe"" import, or ""Butterfly"" but don't waste your money on ""Greatest Hits""."
5,"Once again, Mariah shows she's the best with this Hits Album","Even tough its the tracks on her other albums, its a great Hits album. I love this album and can't get enough of her. She is the best female Artist. The depth in her lyrics cant be compared to anyone's. I don't even have to mention her vocals because everyone knows she is known for her amazing voice."
4,my opinion!,"greatest hits albums are my way of 'either gettting all the songs, from an artist, thatwere popular, or my way of replacing what i lost, when my CD's were lost during moving."
2,Poor sound quality,Sound quality is very poor. Sound selection is good but not woth listening to due to the poor quality of the sound
5,greatest hits,I initially purchased this because it was on sale. I didn't think I knew a lot of the songs as I don't listen to MC a lot but I was really shocked because of the 26 songa I was familiar with 24 of them. I really am glad I purchased this one. Many hardcore MC fans probably have these songs on a few different CDs but this collection is great.
4,mariah,Brings me back. i loved mariah then and i love her now. oldies but goodies. Would for sure suggest this album ;-)
5,A great introduction to Mariah Carey's works,"I had always loved the song ""Hero"" by Mariah Carey, and I wanted to hear more of her material. I decided to purchase her two-disc greatest hits, and I am very happy to say, I am definitely not disappointed. This collection has tracks from most of her albums, even #1s, with the exception of the recently released ""Glitter"" and ""Charmbracelet"" albums. There are also duets with such artists as Whitney Houston, Luther Vandross, etc. All of the songs are generally in the ballad/pop/R&B genre. This compilation has definitely turned me into a fan! I would recommend this to an avid fan of Mariah's, or to a beginner, like myself. You won't regret it."
5,#1s was Mariah's idea. Greatest Hits isn't. Essentials next?,"However the ""Remixes"" does seem like her relationship with Columbia is far from soured, so hopefully the music that has been released from ""Glitter"" to ""Mimi"" and beyond will find their way on to a career retrospective or a ""Greatest Hits II"" (or call them the more appropriately titled ""Chronicles"").1's is good if you're looking for the smash hits, this one is good for her time at Columbia, but I would love to see the ""Essentials"" series put out a CD which would be the songs handpicked by Mariah that would be her own personal favorites that she feels the listeners should take a closer listen to.Hopefully she'll also put out a DVD containing all her videos."
1,Mariah Carey Greates Hits,Not sure why...but i can not play this on my regular CD player....All of my other CD's work but they are at least a year old. This plays on my computer drive but not on my CD player. Are the new ones a different format now????
1,what a waste of a compilation,"why get this if you have all her CD's already? this was obviously released by Sony to make money off her. And look at that cover, she looks like a mannequin getting ready to eat a butterfly! Bad tommy motolla bad bad bad!!!"
1,Not very good,"I was trying to like this but her voice is very limited. It's thin, weak, and raspy. I don't recommend this cd. It's not up to par with other releases from other professional singers out there. But I think they released this cd so soon after Glitter because Glitter was such a flop, they're trying to cover up big time. But this is a flop as well. It's not doing well at all on the charts. She should pack up and close shop."
1,You call that singing? Is she in pain or something?,"Parang pinupunit na yero ang boses nitong berat na 'to. Walang ginawa kundi tumili; wala namang saysay yung kinakanta nito. Isaksak ko kaya ang burat ko dito't tingnan ko kung paano titili ito.'Tang ina mo, Mariah, marami kang naloloko! Parang may tubong nakapasok sa pekpek mo kung makahiyaw ka."
1,Mariah Can't Catch Madonna,"Madonna breaks McCartney Top 10 recordPosted: 19 November 2005 - From Everyhit.comMadonna has entered the singles chart at Number 1 with 'Hung Up.' In doing so, she has secured her 54th Top 10 hit and overtaken Paul McCartney - including his tally with The Beatles, Wings and various other guises. Though both artists trail somewhat behind Elvis' 76 and Cliff's 65 Top 10 hits, they are an elite group; no other artists have had 50 or more Top 10 hits.Other significant Madonna chart facts....-Longest span of Number 1 singles for a female solo artist-Most Top 40 hits for a female solo artist-Most weeks spent on The Top 40 by a female solo artist-Most number 1's by a female solo artist-Female solo artist with most weeks at Number 1"
1,EVEN ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH.,PLEASE DONT EVER MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS AURAL DISASTER OF A COMPILATION FROM THIS WOMAN WITH AN ATROCIOUS SHRIEKY VOICE.ALL THE SONGS ARE BAD BEYOND DESCRIPTION.AVOID THIS LOUSY COMPILATION LIKE THE PLAGUE.GET THE BOX SET FROM NIEL YOUNG INSTEAD.
5,"Wow, what an amazing collection!","This CD will amaze you and has all of her hits through 1999's Rainbow CD. This two disc collection contains over 12 #1 hits including Vision of Love, Emotions, I'll Be There featuring Trey Lorenz (live from MTV Unplugged), Dreamlover, Hero, Fantasy, One Sweet Day, Honey, and Heartbreaker, as well as other huge hits that never quite made it to #1, including Make It Happen, Can't Let Go, Anytime You Need a Friend, Without You, a special remix of All I Want for Christmas is You, and Butterfly. This album will make a great addition to your collection from the Billboard Artist of the Decade."
4,"Well, She Certainly Isn't Original, But Who Cares?","Everything Mariah has produced/written/sung has either been heavily influenced by another writer or features a very obvious sample of a classic cut.Case in point:Fantasy directly copies Tom Tom Club's ""Genius Of Love"", a landmark dance cut.Honey direcly copies Treacherous 3's ""The Body Rock"", a landmark dance cut.Heartbreaker direcly copies Mariah Carey's ""Fantasy"", a landmark dance cut.I think you get my drift.....Still, pop music has not sounded this good in years. And if you can put up with the overabundance of dated early 90s treacly ballads, you get to the good stuff, which is primarily on the second disc.One small problem: not enough remixes, B-sides, unreleased tracks, or rarities. You may as well buy #1s, as this is essentially a repackaging of that 1998 set. Except it costs less. Hence only a 4-star rating for this."
1,sounds more like a collection of rejects and discards,I was so happy that an awful singer like MARIAH(SHRIEKY)was overlooked for the most important awards at the grammys.In fact the very fact that this lousy singer won even one award is surprising.Calling this collection of horrible songs as greatest hits is a big joke.Please DONT and I REPEAT DONT buy this collection.For good music get the very best of IRON MAIDEN instead.No stars.
3,Not my taste,"I don't like this CD overall, but it's not Mariah Carey, it's just the style of music. Her voice is beautiful so I love a couple of the songs, but overall, I can't listen to the music for very long."
4,Great music,"Mariah has that voice you can't copy, all the music are her hits so its worth the money A+ music"
3,Nice reminder of the 90s,"I bought this to remind me of the time when I used to listen to Mariah Carey music. Now that she is hip hop/rap, I haven't been a big fan. Her voice on the old stuff is great and it includes the songs I wanted to hear. Wish there were a few more remixes of her older stuff, but overall, I am happy with it. Especially for the price."
2,This product is just another shampoo. Nothing special ...,This product is just another shampoo. Nothing special about it. It didn't make my hair soft or shiny. It didn't even smell good. It just cleaned my hair. Nothing else.
4,I have tried several different Suave products and ...,"I have tried several different Suave products and have always been satisfied with their price and product. I have used Paul Mitchell's product and see no difference between theirs and Suave's. It left my hair feeling soft and silky and did not weigh my hair down. It had a slightly aromatic fragrance that wasn't overpowering like some shampoos. For the difference in price, I would definitely say to go with Suave. I would also recommend it to my friends."
1,"A lot of Racist ""Jokes""","I got the sample to try first and within the first page, there was a so called joke calling African Americans monkeys and referring to slavery. Not the least bit funny. The next page had a so called joke aimed at Italians and implying they are stupid. I stopped after this. Not sure how the author thinks it is funny, but I am not sure when this was written. I will not buy. I strongly suggest you see a sample before even spending one red cent on this book."
3,"Not bad, but put together from several sources","This is one of those frustrating recordings that has inconsistent audio quality. The first six songs are very well recorded. After that, there is a noticeable change in volume and audio quality and the quality slowly deteriorates. None of it is bad, it's just obvious this is culled from several different sources. The interview at the end has appeared on several recordings, so it's just padding to make this download longer. If you are a completist, you'll want this. If not, there are several Honeyboy Edwards downloads that are much better -- start with the Smithsonian recording from years ago, scratch sound and all, and go from there. But this is definitely not the place to begin collecting Honeyboy's musical legacy."
5,Best blues music video - bar none.,"When I first saw this film at the time of it's release I thought how did a couple of Saturday Nite Live people get to surround themselves by so many blues artists, do blues performing themselves and not create something that was a musical joke. Well I didn't know nuttin at the time, I'm better now. It turns out Belushi and Aykroyd were/are serious blues aficionados and they basically gave/give work and exposure to the ongoing blues scene. So this movie is not ... white guy stuff. It's a real blast from beginning to end, with lots of music both background and on camera performance. Naturally it's a comedy about the angst of modern times as experienced by two white blues men so there's lots of hyperbole concerning cop cars, shopping centers and transient living spaces and a certain supermodel of the time.The DVD is super expensive but well worth it considering the quality of the VHS. Keep them doggies rollin."
2,Blues Brothers,A very dated movie from the past.I only like the car chase in the movie.Acting was poor and not well written.
1,"For a DVD, one fatal flaw...","I was desperately hoping to buy this DVD, thinking that the producers would do the obvious...include a 'family friendly' language option. My two young boys would love to see this movie again, but I can't let them due to verbal content. Every DVD I own has multiple languages, and this movie had to be `cleaned up' for broadcast. So why not here? Yes, it's an excellent movie. Too bad somebody wasn't thinking when it came to the 'options' department..."
2,was this supposed to be an action or a comedy.,I couldn't tell. It was like either the lamest action ever or the most serious comedy ever. either way it was bad.
1,"Initial Problems, but Corrected",I ordered this DVD and was excited to receive it as this is one of my favorite movies. When I received the DVD it didn't play properly. The scenes jumped around at ten minute intervals. The audio didn't line up with the video. I left a negative review. The seller contacted me and sent a new copy. I received it only two or three days later. Just found the other day that this copy does the same thing. Not pleased at all!!
3,one side no good,"The movie side was great, but the special features side didn't work. I tried another DVD player to no avail. Amazon had a great price and delivered as promised. B ut I guess I'm stuck with a defective DVD."
5,Great movie,"Great movie. Nostalgia to the max! The Anniversary edition has some great additions to it. if you have an uncle who grew up in this era, this is a great present."
4,Irreverant with great tunes,"This cult classic will get your foot tapping and singing along with some of the best rhytm and blues you can encounter in one place. The police car pileups will leave Chicago never the same, nor will we. The Akroyd-Belushi will be difficult to match again. The music will keep you singing for hours after the movie ends. The irreverant humor will provide you with a plethora of one-liners to remember and give you a chuckle later on."
4,"Video Quality Just Okay, Audio Quality Great","Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.I watched the extended version, which was about 2 hours 22 minutes long. I wasn't aware of any added scenes - it was how I remembered it. Aspect ratio was 1.85:1 I believe, because it filled my 52"" widescreen LCD (which looks more like 1.5:1). I would rather have had 2.35:1.Video quality started out bad, with a lot of grain, then it got better. Most of the movie had no grain, but the image just wasn't that sharp and detailed, like a Blu-Ray should be. I give it about 8.0 out of 10.The audio was very good, even though it was only DTS 5.1, instead of DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio or Dobly TrueHD 5.1.I forgot how good this movie was."
5,THE best film ever!!!!,"Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, probably the best SNL cast members ever (along with Gilda Radner) play Elwood and Jake Blues in this comedy that I never get bored of watching. The story is engaging, the acting is great, the car chases are, well...expensive and the music is amazing. I strongly recommend this to anyone and if you have yet to see it I envy you. You're in for a real treat."
5,Still laughing at this one.,"This movie never gets old! It is still as funny as ever, and the extra footage even seems to add a little continuity. I come from a suburb of Chicago, and a great amount of the fun I have is in seeing old, familiar places being turned upside-down by the hilarious exploits of Jake and Elwood. A little-known fact of this cinema milestone is that it documents, with great care, much of Chicago's past look. The Maxwell Street sequence, alone,is a clearly-intended slice of the city's history. The beauty, and the cultural depth of Chicago, are fondly portrayed. And don't forget the music! I gotta tell you that this movie has soul, as well as humor. All-time great musicians are all over this work.Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway, and don't forget John Lee Hooker! What a line-up, and what a sound!Seriously good laughs, music, acting, and story. A real movie classic."
5,Cult...,"Blues Brothers is simply the best film made in the 80s.It has everything: car accidents, cool jokes, exciting musicians (except the ""Good 'ole Boys). Simply said: a must-see. And, do not forget: They are on a mission from God."
5,CLASSIC,"This is a classic,akryod and belushi what a great combination from these 2 guys that are on a mission from god and pull many antics that will have you laughing non stop."
4,A Classic Film,"They're on a mission from God, it's 106 miles to Chicago, they've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark and they're wearing sunglasses.If you liked Animal House, you'll appreciate the same bits of absurd, random humor found in this film along with the classic music that has helped shape America. A fun film to watch which many have considered to be the gateway to their interest in the blues. The all-star cast of Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, James Brown, Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles and others make quite a dynamic musical comedy.My only problem is that my DVD continues to display french subtitles each time I load the disc despite turning them off each time."
3,Dissapointing to the true BB enthusiast.,"Yes, its great that Universal FINALLY released this movie on DVD, but they really should have included with it a copy of the originally edited film. I love this film so much that I will have to go buy a VCR just to watch my old wore out copy of BB (my 4th copy lol) because the unedited one just screws up the whole flow and feel to the movie. The extended scenes are interesting, but this movie is NOT the blues brothers. My recommendation to you, if by some chance you havent seen it yet is to buy this film on VHS first, watch it, then get the DVD...."
1,Anniversary dissapointment Blues Brothers,"My copy was pixalated a great deal. Unwatchable. The original side had a blank 20 seconds of silence as well. Horrible copy. The copying aparatus must be faulty, and there weren't quality control measures in effect. I returned it for a refund.Last week.I still want it. But Amazon is not able to supply it as Amazon is not the source. Yes I bought it through Amazon...Amazon is ALWAYS fast and hasn't made a mistake yet."
5,Godliness Accomplished,"Jake and Elwood Blues are on a mission from God. Save the orphanage which they were raised in. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are the brothers in black and try to raise money for the biggest blues concert ever. They try to get their band back together and stay out of a crazy woman's trigger range. A church enlightens them and many people do backflips! You better give Aretha Franklin some respect, buddy! The music will have you jumping on your feet and clapping. Oh yes, brother! Testify! I have seen the light! ""The Blues Brothers"" is the best musical to have ever hit the big screen. The car chases are memorable and the race to the bank at the end is history. 'Hut Hut Hut Hut Hut Hut,' yes! The brothers were chased by cowboys, an ex-wife, police, S.W.A.T. teams and more! Too bad the sequel isn't as inspiring."
5,CLASSIC HILARIOUS COMEDY,"This is the story of the Blues Brothers. Jake (John Belushi) has just gotten out of jail, his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) is taking him in. Together they try to get their band ""The Blues Brothers"" back together. But complications arise with a police officer (John Candy) a crazy ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher), a mad bar owner (Charles Napier) and a group of Nazi. A classic comedy with memorable lines. The sequel isn't as good, and is only for die-Hard Blues Brothers fans who don't care about the quality in film. I give the sequel two stars."
5,And why.....?,"Why, oh why would they even consider making the 25th Anniversary edition and not bring it out on Blu-Ray. Ridiculous! So much for my hubbie's Xmas gift!"
4,One can but hope...,"I'll wait until the BluRay reviews come out. The BluRay ""Ghostbusters"" is so bad it makes you look for your VHS copy as an improvement. If only it could be as good as the ""American Werewolf..."" package.And why are there no details? If ever there was a movie I wanted a Digital Copy of, it's this one. Also wondering why Amazon doesn't offer the single-disk extended version DVD (with that, who needs the theatrical release, after all?).The film is a classic (and all of you who are afraid to see BB2000 should try it - it's terrific) but who needs a sloppy copy? Here's hoping..."
1,Wouldn't watch it again for money.,"Unless you like the blues as covered by manic amateurs in an unending Saturday Night Live sketch, avoid this Two-Stoogified, let's-put-on-a-show time-waster.At any moment, I expected a samurai shouting ""cheesebaga, cheesebaga"" to run onstage while brandishing a plastic sword.A seat-squirmer of a movie.Wouldn't watch it again for money.Fans, remember: De gustibus non est disputandum"
1,Difficulties,Are DVDs playable all over the world or is there a geographical limit? We could not get this to play
4,I LOVE TO LAUGH!,IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO REMEMBER THE FUNNY THINGS THAT BRIGHTENED UP OUR LIVES BEFORE 911
1,*** DO - NOT - BUY!!! *** will be re-released this year!,"This is a awesome movie, but these people are trying to rip you off!This DVD is out-of-print because Universal is planning on releasing the 25th anniversary edition sometime this year. Wait for it, only and idiot would pay these fools.Check out: http://www.bluesbrotherscentral.com"
2,Disc errors,"I love this movie. I couldn't wait to get it on DVD. But , i get it home and i can't watch it because of a defective disc. Same as the other reviewer, as they leave the Country Bunker it starts to skip around and freezes up in the Steam room scene and never recovers. i tried skipping ahead, didn't work. i will try and take it back today and get my money back or a different disc.What a pain.Also a commentary track would have been nice.update 9/2/05 I went back and traded in for another disc it seems to play fine, so i can at least watch the movie. I would like to add with the other reviewer: How about some extras on a 25th anniversary release!"
4,My All-Time Favorite (Almost),"This movie brings back so many memories of my youth. It is on my Top 5 all-time favorites. But, I was a little distressed to see that the DVD does not offer the option of watching the original theatrical release. Instead they have added the deleated scenes directly into the film, which is distracting for someone who knows this film as I do. Mind you, I am not complaining about the extra footage, especially the extended jam by John Lee Hooker on Maxwell Street, but the added footage can detract from the overall enjoyment of this classic. Thus, while the film rates a 5++++, the DVD gets a 4."
5,VHS,"great Movie but now you can get in DVD, I bought for my father in law and he did not own any DVDs at the time"
5,Classic of Comedic Classics,But you must consider the source -- The Blues Brothers is my second favorite movie;my first -- The Wizard of Oz...
5,Loved it!,I really liked the movie when it came out and am pleased that it has held up so well over the years! Music is great and seeing so many of the wonderful blues artists perform is not to be missed!
4,Belushi is great,"This is a great movie not as great as ""Animal House"" but it is definitley a classic. Mission from God."
4,Still funny and enjoyable....,"How can anyone not love the Blues Brothers? Its been over 20 years since seeing this movie and by todays standards it could be considered a bit hokey, but a great trip and lots of fun. What can I say, this is one of the all time favorite ""guy's"" cult films, right up there with Animal House. A must for your video library."
5,A Blissful Homage To Mayhem and Classic R 'N' B,"Your first reaction to this film is to recoil at the destruction. You think, how much more damage can be done? Then director John Landis tops himself in the succeeding scenes. Unlike the film ""1941"" where the destruction was just pointless, there is a certain poetry to the chaos on display here. Not lost among the ruins are crackerjack production numbers by immortal r'n'b performers (Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway). Landis does not just give lip service to these performers he gives them an elaborate stage to show their stuff. I was a teenager when I first saw this film and it spurred my interest in this music. Even the Sam and Dave cassette tape that the brothers play in their car piqued my interest. John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd are deliciously low-key as the brothers. Alot of good cameos in this film. Just tighten your seatbelts and enjoy the fun."
5,We're on a Mission from God,"The Blues Brothers features Dan Akyrod and John Belushi(RIP) in thier comedy classic flim from their Saturday Night Live skit. Jake Blues(John Belushi)is released from prison and after that he tells his brother Elwood(Dan Akyrod) that he wants to put the band back together. Jake and Elwood go to all of these crazy adventures and it also features cameos from James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles(RIP) and more. It also features alot of musical numbers and great songs. I love this movie and it is up their in my DVD movie collection. I suggest you guys pick this movie if your looking for some laughs, or some music this is the movie for you!Lady: Are you the police?Elwood: No ma'am were musicans."
4,Classic Film - Flawed DVD,"There is no need to restate the obvious, this is a classic five star film. The re-edit, however, draws only four. Most of the additional footage appears to be an effort to better explain certain scenes. What in this movie needs clarification? Its a comedy! The scene of Elwood quitting his job (none of which was included in the theatrical release) seems entirely out of place. What is Elwood doing working in a factory? it neither makes sense, nor does it build his character. Jake and Elwood are mythical beings and shouldn't be dragged down into our common reality.This isn't the first Belushi DVD to suffer from improvement. 1941 has some similarly stupid/useless material added in the DVD version. To date, the only ""director's cut"" I consider an improvement is Blade Runner. Message to Hollywood. If the original movie has a big following, DON'T SCREW WITH IT! If you must meddle, choose the movies nobody cares about. They're the ones in need of help."
1,do not pay this much for this movie,this is a great movie but it is going to be rereleasing in a couple of months for only 19.99 do if you want to save alot of money do not buy it from the people on here you are getting ripped off
1,"NOT 2 DISCS - IT'S A ""FLIPPER""","What is wrong with Universal? Are they so cheap that they can't offer a second disc? Imagine the 4 disc. LOR boxed set being put on 2 flippers!! SORRY, flippers are a pain! They are harder to take care of and are almost always of poorer quality. HEY UNIVERSAL - IF WE ARE DUMB ENOUGH TO BUY A PENNY FOR A DOLLAR, AT LEAST GIVE US THE PENNY!!!!!!5 star movie, Zero star DVD.As far as the movie, this one has replay value like no other! Crazy car chases, awesome music and Dan and John at the top of their game."
3,You need to be a fan of first movie to appreciate this.,"This was not nearly as good as I remembered, but it does have some funny stuff. It has a huge list of stars. Not as good as original Blues brothers, but okay. shipping was fast."
4,Husbands and daughters favorite movie of all time,"The old VHS Blues Brothers bit the dust. Was afraid we wouldn't be able to replace it but again, Amazon came thru. VHS and new too. Everybodies happy now."
4,both versions are on this 2 disc set!,"Don't let the fear of only getting the extended cut stop you from picking up this dvd.The original theatrical cut is included as well.As a fan of the film and the music, it will be worth it for the extended musical performances alone."
1,this DVD malfunctions,"Like another reviewer, I found that the DVD freezes after about 1.5 hours. The DVD is two-sided, with the theatrical version on one side and the extended director's cut on the other. Both sieze up and just stop playing. The scenes that are ruined are: when Jake and Elwood meet that country band in the parking lot, the steam room scene with Steve Lawrence, and the run-up to the big fund-raising concert. The disc is poor quality and very disappointing. Unfortunately I did not save my Amazon receipt..."
1,Blues Brothers,The product failed to perform. It simply stopped midway through a scene. I now see that it was a two sided disc which would have been nice to know when I purchased it. I returned the product as defective to the manufacturer as instructed and asked that I be credited for product and shipping. I have still not heard a word.Very dissatisfied with my first Amazon experience.
3,Good movie.,"This Movie is good every once in a while. I think that you will like it. It's a good movie. But, Definitely not for kids though!Rating: R For Language"
3,How far can you stretch a comedy sketch?,"I think the producers realized that no one was really interested in seeing a full-length movie of the Akroyd & Belushi ""Blues Brothers"" characters. This movie is really an excuse to cameo some of the best REAL blues & R&B performers. If you watch this movie, watch it for that; don't expect much from the plot."
5,Gift for my sis,She is on a mission from God and loves this movie. Now when I get over there to teach her how to operate the Dvd. she will really enjoy it at least once.
5,"Still a favourite, so many years later","""The Blues Brothers"" still manages to surprise and delight after numerous viewings over nearly three decades. It seems self-evident that the magic of John Belushi goes a long way to explaining the success of this film. The on-stage chemistry with Dan Aykroyd just works, somehow lifting this B-movie plot up onto a higher level. And of course, the music helps - what blues lover could fail to enjoy the range and depth of the performances by some of the great bluesmen of the twentieth century. I suppose it's an extra delight to be able to enjoy the blues antics of the main characters as well.If you haven't seen it, get it at once - it's not only a classic that will endure, it's also good (mostly) family entertainment and it's a tribute to a great actor who was, tragically, much nearer to the end of his career when he made this, that he ought to have been."
1,Doesn't work in PS3 with current firmware,"I was looking forward to watching The Blues Brothers in HD and with good sound. Sadly, this disc does not work in my Sony PS3. It sits in the loading disc state forever and never loads. I have the latest PS3 firmware. Lame that Universal did not do a thorough job in QA. All my other BluRay discs work in my PS3."
1,New Edition Garbage,"Thank you to the people out there specifically rating the edition. The ""new"" features really do suck. Let the movie companies know you're sick of this re-issue, new edition garbage, and everyone out there keep on giving bad reviews to these crappy ""new"" editions. Let the weasely bean counters in accounting know that their greedy grab for a profit margin will ultimately turn consumers off from buying their products period. It's certainly given me pause when it comes to buying a new DVD."
3,easy to set up but lacking some features,"Not a bad product, very easy to set up, and the range is pretty good. The only problem is the interface is a bit ignorant. For example, no configuration for TCP and UDP port forwarding. Probably best if you want a repeater or are adding wi-fi to your router and you're not too worried about advanced features,"
3,Repeats the Bowflex Ultimate Manual,"I bought a used Bowflex and the seller didn't have the manual. I wanted to use the machine properly and ordered a manual from the company, but it was back-ordered so I bought this book. It's well written and the photographs are good, but once the manual arrived I saw the book was pretty much a repeat. If you want a hardback, then buy the book, otherwise buy the manual since it's much less expensive."
4,Good book on using bowflex and overall healthy lifestyle guide,This book has a lot of helpful information. The diet and exercise tips are great. I only gave it four stars because the photo of the machine pictured in the book are not helpful since the machine is not like the bowflex PR 1000 machine we purchased. We have to try to figure out how to translate the instructions to the machine we have. We have been using the booklet that came with the machine more.
5,Outstanding!,"For BF owners hoping to take their game to the next level, this is perfect! Really helped me expand my workouts."
2,Wasted Money,"This book is pretty much a waste,. It is an old book using an old machine. Yes the same stuff can be done done but it would be nice to see updated equipment. There is very little how to in this book,. The first part is exercise talk, The last part is bow flex hype about a few of the people who havebow flex bodies, and the middle which I thought this book wood extensively cover has a few pages on the actual exercises.To me this book is a waste but maybe to someone who needs motivation it may be helpful."
2,bowflex book,I returned the book because it was not what I was looking for. I wanted a book that would show me exercise that would work with my bowflex. It did not it did show other bowflex machines but not the one that I have. If it would describe what machines that it worked with it would have helped me to decide better if I had wanted to purchase the book to begin with.
2,"Great Resistance Training info; however, did not match equip.",Great information in detailing the hows and whys of the Bowflex and resistance training but many of the exercises suggested did not match my newly purchased PR1000; which renders the book as about half useless. Had to go back and use the handout that came with my machine. Would be awesome if it was supplemented to match the different types of machines out there....I would then most likely rate it as a five star. Anyone know of a supplement or have cross-over information directed towards the PR1000?
5,Bowflex Body Plan,"This is an excellent book! By following the workout routines I lost 14 lbs and gained 5 1/2 lbs of muscle in 6 weeks. I did NOT strictly follow the diet guidelines, but if I did I would probably have doubled my fat loss. In fact, I pigged out on meals and desserts for about five days during Thanksgiving (within the 6 week period).Achieving muscular failure within 8 to 12 reps is the key, along with proper rest, superhydration and proper diet. The book shows pictures of how to do the workouts and provides accurate descriptions, both to ensure proper form.Dr. Darden's principals as explained in this book have turned me into a lifetime fan. I love working out on the bowflex and have stuck with it for 10 weeks now and have no plans on stopping. I highly recommed this book."
4,BOWFLEX TRAINING,"I bought this book because the manual that came with my Bowflex didnt show all the excercises. There are your basic and advanced routines in this book for the bowflex user. I reccoment this book for the serious trainer who has a bowflex, or if you're buying one from the catalog or online, get the salesperson to throw it in with your purchase. I wish I did. You will get the basic programme and diets with your bowflex anyways, there are just some good advanced ideas in the book. Its a good idea to vary your routine every 6-10 weeks anyways to avoid stagnation."
4,Something Old Something New,"Having read a couple of Dardens previous books much of the information concerning nutrition and exercise theroy is the same. Darden, the Consumate student of Arthur Jones, applies the nautilus principles to the bowflex in a manner that is consistent with his earlier works. He presents a series of routines that are work-able by most any one and should produce results in begginers and early intermediates. The book is artfully photographed, well laid out, and will appeal to the same audiance as the bowflex itself"
5,Boflex Body Plan,This book was excellent. The book explains the theory behind the exercise and diet programs so you know WHY you are doing certain things. It is written in simplistic form so that anyone can understand the information. I would recommend this book to anyone with a bowflex.
1,Like a commercial!,"I was looking for exercises I could do with the used bowflex I recieved. This book actually contains very few exercises, almost all of which require the optional bowflex accessories that I do not have. In general, it makes me feel that the bowflex I have is a piece of junk, and I should get the ""Ultimate"" one, with all the bells and whistles for a few grand. Again, there are very few exercises in this book - the author discuesses food, the merits of exercise, and what else - the bowflex machine, more than anything. My search for finding bowflex exercises continues! (Now I am off to the store to return this book!)"
2,not enough pictures of exercises,"This book has basic nutrition info and workout info, but not enough details about the bowflex and the numerous exercises you can do with it. I was hoping for pictures of MANY different exercises for different body parts, since I bought my bowflex used and it didn't come with a manual. I was very disappointed and I'll probably end up buying the manual from the factory for another $12.95 plus s/h. If you know nothing about nutrition or how to build muscle and lose weight, and you're starting from scratch, this might be good info for you."
3,Severely Outdated,"This book contains much useful information but is severely outdated. Bowflex no longer makes the equipment featured in this book. If you have the manuals and DVD that came with your Bowflex, you probably don't need this book."
3,Almost like the user manual,"This pretty much has what is in the user manual you get with the machine. There are a few other exercises in it and more backgroung info. It's good to get if you've lost your manual or if you want a sturdier, hardback copy."
3,ok,"The book was a bit out of date with regards to technology in body building and diet. Other aspects were quite good, however. The book needs revision."
1,RIP OFF!,great book to further market their product. you can get the same advice from any fitness magazine or book on circuit training and nutrition. nothing revolutionary here. spend your money elsewhere... what a rip off!
5,Outstanding Value,"For the intent and scope of this beginner's Bible dictionary, it is of outstanding value and the price is not bad either. I recommend this dictionary to my seniors Bible study classes and I'm giving a copy to the young man I'm mentoring for confirmation. Word meanings are short, concise and easy to understand and it is filled with all sorts of explanatory charts, tables, diagrams and maps, as well as, some superb artwork. I have a more complete dictionary for home study use but this is the one I carry to class."
5,helpful,"This dictionary is very useful in Bible study.it help to find the true meanimg of a word or place that is in the Bible.this was gtven to my mother-in-law,she loves this book."
5,A okay,The Student Bible Dictionary.Required material for studies.Arrived earlier then neededa be cee dee for gee today okay
5,Great Resource,"I purchased the dictionary for my husband who recently gave his life to Christ. He loves how this book breaks down words, location and people in the Bible. I have thumbed through it myself and found some really helpful insights."
1,caution...extreme homophobia,"If you belong to an even moderately liberal church, do NOT use this student Bible dictionary. I have actually given it out to beginning youth classes for a few years, and have used it on occasion to look up terms. Just recently, I had a parent come to me with their youth's dictionary and point out to me that the definition of ""homosexual"" contains the phrase ""contrary to the will of God""!! I absolutely do not agree with this, nor does my church, which welcomes everyone, nor my denomination (United Church of Christ). I was appalled by this entry, and promptly did a recall on the books we had handed out that day. I am in the process of looking for an alternative to this book, which I will NEVER hand out again..."
5,Real Praise......,"Listen...this is real praise caribbean style.. sherwin has it locked. The reggeae/soca feel of this track will have any christian rocking... check out ""I Worship You"". Real hard core roots reggae rock. This is a good CD..."
4,Best collection of the hard stuff,"As of Fall 2007, this is the best compilation of urban African club music I have found available in the United States. Songs with tough beats and propulsive grooves. Recommended for DJs.IK"
4,Very good compilation,"Superb hard house and techno that gets under the skin. Heard some of these tunes in Factory, spun perfectly. Great overall."
3,Okay but overpriced,"This handbook had some decent activities and questionnaires. There was a lot of repetition for the activities, however, with similar sections for participants and facilitators in each. So, instead of having 250+ pages of novel material there is maybe 50 pages.There were four or five self-reflection questions in many of the activities that seemed fairly commonsense. I guess I was hoping for more thought and emotion-provoking material. For the price I expected more. This handbook would be a good value if it was not quite as expensive."
4,good,Looks great and works well with the sword I bought it for. Has held up well to the use for which it was purchased.
4,I want to look like Ahnold....,This greatly enhanced my weight training program. The instructions were easy to follow and produced good results.I recommend this to folks who are used to long bars (like me before). Help them do more toning than bulking.
4,Dumbell Training for Strength and Fitness.,Contains a treasure trove of practical dumbbell circuit workouts by different trainers.Just skip through the first half of the book.Glyn
4,good concise book,"An extremely concise and most practical guide for dumbbell use but does not get 5 stars as the technique of doing various exercises, the mistakes which can be made, the proper form required is not as much elucidated. I would recommend simultaneous reading of McRobert's insider's guide for weight training along with this book."
1,a beginners guide only,I was surprised that this book is just a beginner's guide - they left out many many dumbbell routines that are very useful. I assumed wrong this was a comprehensive book with some routines I have never seen - but it was not. The four star rating really threw me on this one.
2,Woefully unimpressed,"I'm not sure what all the positive reviews are about but I have to admit that I was under-whelmed with this book. Now, it doesn't matter to me that the pictures are small (not as small as stamps as one reviewer put it), but the information in the book seems overly simplistic. In fact, there's not much information here at all. Myatt Murphy's Ultimate Dumbbell Guide is much, much better (and bigger too)."
4,Good read with useful information,This book was a quick read but contained good information about dumbbell training. A little history of dumbbells as well.
5,Great book,"This is a very readable book which provides theory, practice, and suggested routines. Excellent reasonable approach for the person who just wants to keep in shape."
4,Detailed and easy to read,"Lots of programs to choose from and very informative. Can seem a little overwhelming at first. I suggest picking one program, sticking with it for a while and then moving on to the next."
2,Author got lazy,"I was disappointed with this book. The author is not specific with the muscles worked. He says an exercise works the triceps instead of which of the 3 heads it focuses on or the exercise works the abs and not if it is upper, mid or lower abs. Same thing with shoulders. The author doesn't state if the exercise works the middle delt or the rear or front delt. The descriptions of the exercises are also re-hashed. Every explanation of particular muscle groups exercises are basically the same with a few words changed out. It just seems like the author wanted to churn out this book wihout being fresh or specific."
5,complete dumbbell training,I ordered the book with the intent of replacing my aging bowflex machine with adjustible dumbbells.The book surpassed my expectations by giving very good advice as to the advantages and disanvantages of their use---with solid training advice and many different routines.Overall I would highly recommend this book for a no nonsense guide to dumbbell training.
1,MK power drive 65v2,"Don't buy this piece of junk.If you are an aspiring wrestler then this piece of engineering nightmare just might be what you need, believe me it will be a wrestling match to get it in and out of the water!I contacted Minn Kota and told them my opinion of this motor and the customer rep pretty much agreed and suggested I try to sell it! Wow! what a big help he was."
4,Back in the day....,"I used to play this 8 Track all the time!! Might not be the ""best"" Tull songs ever but man are these good. So glad my Mom let me play her music as a kid!"
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.,"THIS UNIT ALLOWS YOU TO PLUG YOUR LAPTOP INTO ITS MIXER AND BECOME THE ULTIMATE LAPTOP DJ. I WAS ABLE TO HOOK UP ADDITIONAL INPUTS SUCH AS A CD MIXER, IPOD, HEADPHONES AND A MICROPHONE ALL AT THE SAME TIME. THE COMPUTER HOOKS RIGHT INTO THE USB PORT AND IT'S SMOOTH SAILING ALL THE WAY. THE COST IS GREAT AND EVEN INCLDES THE MICROPHONE AND HEADPHONES. A GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE."
5,The mana'o (meaning).,"This cd is one of the most intense cd's i have ever encountered.The mezmerizing voice and the manao(meaning) behind each song is absolutely awesome. Mark kealii has and always will be, the most awesome chanter whether or not it is modern and traditional all in one. You are and always will be at the top no matter how far out there people may see you."
4,Call it what you like,"Once again Kealii has brought a new,fresh feeling and sound to songs that are known and loved in Hawaii. I love his drumming rythmns and the classic style that is all his even when used on old hawaiian standards, you will want to hear it again and again."
5,Hawaiian Chant comes alive,"Once upon a time there was an island of unmatched beauty inhabited by beautiful people. Others came from far away and took over the islands and their culture. After years of oppression, the beautiful people decided the way of their ancestors had value and they worked to bring back the ways of their people. Mark Keali'i's music bridges the gap between the past and the future of Hawaiian Chant. He brings a sense of melody to Hawaiian Chant that is unlike any other. Some might think MK's style and arrangements aren't historically accurate, but for my haole ears they breathe life and make this music more relateable in the present. There's no good reason why Hawaiian Chant should end up lifeless and frozen in time like Latin. This CD is alive with respect for the past, love of the music and hope for the evolving future of Hawaiian Chant."
3,Texas Comments,"Heavy, solid sheets since they are 600 count. Unfortunately, they wrinkle alot. I've tried every way to wash them but, come out very wrinkled. Also, not very soft. The lack of softness and the wrinkle problem made me give this the 3 Star rating."
5,1 year anniversary for these sheets and still holding strong,"Don't go for the 1,200 thread count. You don't need to , these sheets have been washed and dryed umteen times over the past year. They hold up well, still feel soft, keep their color, do not shrink, and wrinkle only lightly. The price is right."
4,Challenging Reference,"For a secular philosopher, Hannah Arendt certainly presents a challenge to Christian thought. However, much of her writing stimulates lines of thought that would not otherwise have been pursued. She cites Jesus as the ""discoverer"" of personal forgiveness who presents it as an alternative to the moral system of sacrifices in a temple in his day, thus removing the authority from a priesthood to control the populace. A Christian might rather say of Jesus that he is the creator of forgiveness, not the discoverer, but her observation remains about the dynamics of who controls the moral system in place."
3,Unbelievably verbose and difficult to read,"I should forewarn those who are about to the buy this book that you ought to first be well read in ancient Greek Culture: philosophy, political city-state as well as Greek mythology. Arendt uses a lot of Greek terminology which can make it incredibly difficult for the average Liberal Arts student or international student, for that matter, who are unfamiliar with these these terms.No doubt the concepts she spoke of in the mid-50s are more than applicable to todays society. She was clearly a woman ahead of her time, but much too brainy for her own good. Chapter 2 on the ""Public and Private Realm"" is a 50+ page drag, emphasis on the word DRAG. I'm barely scraping through this chapter.Had Arendt chosen to write in a taut, less opulent but fluid fashion, she could have easily connected to average readers and would have been an instant bestseller. If she did in fact become one...then more power to her.Two cents worth from a frustrated liberal arts student."
2,Bleh,"I had to read this book for class but it was so wordy and awkward that i couldn't get through it. There are some pages that have more unrelated footnotes than words and there are a lot of phrases in Latin, which they only tell you the meaning of once, in a footnote..."
1,authentic astronaut kung pao lab gunk,This product is EXTREMELY salty and sweet with an after taste of preservative chemicals. The peanuts taste like what i imagine astronaut food tastes like... completely stale and awful. I just ate 1/4 of a bowl and had to throw it out. Everyone in my work area is complaining about the stench... one of them happens to be a Korean girl. Run far far far away ... simple ramen noodles or even cup of noodles is 999% better than this laboratory experiment of a food.To the people saying this tastes authentic... HUH? Not sure what your definition of authentic is but this stuff hardly tastes like food.
1,"Pasty, nasty, don't bother","These noodles replaced another, excellent brand on our grocery shelves. (Annie Chun, fyi.) Both brands make similar flavors--Kung Pao, Sesame, Peanut, etc.These noodles have a pastiness that is unpleasant and no really good flavor. I like this variety of convenient pre-boiled noodles for a quick lunch at work; they are easy to make up in the microwave and come in a bowl of their own (though I put mine into a ceramic bowl as I don't like eating out of plastic if I can help it.) Sometimes I am too busy to go out for lunch and hot noodles are very pleasant. But these are NOT pleasant. No, indeed.These are dominating our grocery shelves but they don't deserve to be there. Bad taste and texture. Just bad. Don't bother."
1,** Pure Garbage **,This stuff is absolutely HORRIBLE. Do the board members of these companies actually taste the garbage they sell?Pure garbage.
5,"Quick, easy, tastes great.","I don't understand the large number of negative reviews about this product, but Simply Asia makes really great microwaveable Kung Pao Noodles. They hands down taste better McDougall's, which come out as a crunchy mess and is barely edible. Just be sure not to add too much water or the taste does get diluted."
3,Time to Try it Again?,"I purchased a package of the Spicy Kung Pao Noodle Bowl in August of 2012. The label says, ""new & improved.""So... for those of you who didn't like it the first time around, it may be worth another try.Two things to note:Calories per bowl = 460Sodium per bowl = 1350mg (56% of daily recommended amount)I like these noodle bowls but do not eat them often due to the sodium content. A bit too high for one food item."
1,AWFUL! Slimey and smells like melted plastic...,"Wow. I was really excited to try these; unfortunately, after struggling through about six bites, I had to throw it away. Immediately out of the microwave, the bowl reeked of melted plastic. At first, I thought I had melted the bowl, but after inspecting it and attempting several bites, I discovered it was the scent of the noodles and broth. The noodles were super fine, which I like; however, I couldn't get past the super slimey feel. They almost seemed like they had a glue-like consistency. I only cooked for two of the recommended 2-3 minutes. I don't know if you get different results with the boil and pour method, but I disliked them so much I'm not willing to give that a try."
5,Lost Music,"This C.D. has just some of the best hawaiian music has to offer. I moved to Seattle a few years ago. I just wanted to say that even though i'm not on the islands anymore. I'll never forget where i'm from and what I am. Hawaiian music touches everyones heart. Thanking the Hawaiian Style Band for singing such awesome songs. Always, Mo!"
5,good part,"timkin bearings always have been the best you can but and still are, all i trust for me and mine."
4,"Great pictures, engaging poetry","Ms. Munsinger's pictures make this book come alive. Her clever portrayals of animals doing extraordinary feats or ordinary human activities are amusing to all ages. The poems range from the complex to the very simple, so it is a book that can appeal to different age groups or can be returned to again and again. My favorite is the tiger in his striped ""jym-jam pajamas."""
3,I Paid $70 something for this?,"Look i know theres not alot of english books on this art that are good, but this is ridiculous. I decided to buy this book , few days later, i see this small book. Dont get me wrong its a good book, but it couldve had a hell of alot more info.Also to add insult, there were holes in the book like it was paper. Plus the price was ludicris, and now i see it went down which means i couldve saved a bit more. This is the price for buying rare prints of books."
4,"Boxe Fraincaise, Savate","I liked the book as a former karate diciple. Why; because it has nothing to do with religion, i.e. you do not have to greet in front of Gods that are not Chritstian. Allthough, it is very similar to karate, but also teaches techniques, which are efficient in street fighting. Unfortunately, I am in my late fithies, and there is no club in Stockholm Sweden. Why not? The greater Stocholm area has 2 million inhabitants. If there are persons intrested in Savate fighting I would like to come in contact with them.Box Fraincaise Savate :)RegardsUdo"
2,A disappointing attempt at comedy.,"This movie couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be a sex comedy along the lines of AMERICAN PIE or a romantic comedy akin to SHE'S ALL THAT. It had the potential to be good whichever way it went, but it never lived up to it in either one. The sex jokes were uninspired and the situations felt awkward and forced. The romance wasn't really emphasized and just not done very well, I felt. Normally, you're rooting for the boy to get the girl, but, in this film, I didn't really care. I felt nothing for the characters; I didn't even find myself rooting against the ""villain"". Be it the writer's or the director's fault, it was just very badly done. The acting was decent and the dialogue was well written, but the story development just left me feeling flat. Disappointing."
3,Cute,"I really liked this film. THe heart throb Shane West protrays a main character Ryan, or Bryan Ryan. He has his heart set on the beautiful Jodi Lyn who is your typical high school snob.Marla and James try to ""Get something"" happening, but it all fails. The movie incorporates many funny parts along with the smooth plot, and the ending sets happy ""I told you so's""The teenage audiances will enjoy the quick movie."
1,lousy,"Whatever it Takes is my pick for the worst teen comedy ever made. Miles below She's All That Never Been Kissed and American Pie and yes even worse than Can't Hardly Wait and the horrifying Melissa Joan Hart disaster You Drive me Crazy, Whatever it takes is boring an inept from start to finish. 2 guys join forces to help eachother get the girl of their dreams. 1 girl is the jock guy's cousin. The other girl is the best friend of the nice guy. It rips off a little Cyrano and a little She's all that. Complete with the cliched prom scene climax and the twist ending that you can predict from the first 5 minutes."
1,HuH?,"This wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it left me just feeling sad that I spent money to buy it. The characters are predictable, the plot is predictable.. well, I should have seen it coming. However, there are a couple of funny moments. That's why I give this movie one star."
2,Worst teen romance flick I have seen....,Whatever it Takes...This movie was not even worth my time in watching it. I even heard it was so good I bought it and I hate it! I love teen/romance movies but this one was not one I will ever watch again and struggled to get through the first time!Reading the synopsis will let you know just what the plot of this movie is. My thoughts skip this one all together.
3,Great stuff!,"If you're a fan of bad movies as a genre, this can be a lot of fun. It's a ""must see"" for James Franco fans. Franco does his method- acting- Marlon- Brando- James- Dean schtick surrounded by Baywatch rejects and Tiger Beat boybabes. The director never misses a chance to sexually exploit Franco's body, which makes for an especially hilarious director and cast commentary. The director actually says things like ""and in this scene, I wanted more full body shots of Franco wearing only a thong and tied to the bed, but the ratings board only allowed one;"" and ""here, I wanted a big close up of Franco's naked butt, but the ratings board made me take it out."" The female lead then replies ""Oh yes, I remember working all day with Franco's naked butt right in front of my face..."" Or something similar. It's a hoot."
4,Comes off more as a spoof,"This movie was pretty...dumb. But I mean that in a good way. I literally laughed really hard at alot of scenes in this movie. Luckly nothing in this movie is really all that serious. There was some good jokes and some very witty little visual gags. Plus it shows that the ""perfect"" people aren't that perfect.What really helped is that all the acting was pulled off. This was like a messed up Sixteen Candles. Although I am still not sure how this movie got a PG-13 (the giant six foot penis says it all). If you want a dumb yet entertaning movie then see this."
4,2 Reasons To Get This DVD,"This is your typical teen/chick flick, but it is still funny and even guys will enjoy it. But the main two reasons to get this movie: Marla Sokoloff and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. These girls are certainly easy on the eyes and make for excellent viewing. Collin Hanks also makes what I think is his movie debut in this film."
3,James Franco in Whatever it takes,This movie sure is a 90's teen movie. But if you like she's all that and all the other 90's teen movie you'll like it. If you like James Franco then you'll also like the movie. Its way back when he was young and there are good bouns features.
5,Do WHATEVER IT TAKES To See This Movie ; ),"I've been a big fan of teen movies forever and ""Whatever It Takes"" is the best that I've seen. It has a great cast including Shane West who is the recent movie ""A Walk To Remember"" co-starring with Mandy Moore. The movie is about two guys that help each other to get the girls they like to fall for them, and ryans (shane west) dorky friends trying to find dates for a prom and then the SUPER HOTT Floyd (Aaron Paul) Ruin the prom so he can go to jail...and thats not all I just suck really bad at the whole giving reviews thing. So, thats all I have to say, except that all those people who gave this movie a bad review have no clue what their talking about :) buy the movie"
2,Whatever It Takes,"There was a very unnecessary scene of the auditorium with the nurse; very distasteful!! That's Hollywood!! They think they had to have the scene, but they didn't really need to!! When will they ever learn!!?"
5,Excellent Writing.,"Occasionally a writer creates a story that is both horrible and wonderful; TO BUILD A FIRE is one of these stories. Reading it I thought of some negative criticism I had recently read about London's writing. I think the critic is full of it. TO BUILD A FIRE and much of London's writing is high octane, powerful stuff."
4,just as advertised!,I'm very pleased with this purchase. It is a nice surprise to get exactly what you ordered.
3,"very wordy, and not much how-to","There is a lot about his experience, in this book, but only maybe 3 pages of how to. I was somewhat disappointed. Still and all, it is interesting to see that spiritual healing was alive and well in the 50's and 60's. I think a book likeThetaHealingorMatrix Energetics: The Science and Art of Transformationwould be more useful than this book. I was not sorry I read it, it just didn't have a lot I could apply.A Guide to Spirit Healingapparently has more how-to. For straight content, 4 stars, but I wanted the how to, as inAmazing Secrets of Psychic Healing."
5,great for the young lover,"if you have not given ur valentine a gift yet, this is the best way to do it. very romantic and great songs, sony music does a great thing to make a collection of such songs, buy it, i have it, i recommend it"
5,Great game idea!,"Bought this for my parents for Christmas. Since they have everything I thought this would be different. Unfortunately, I think they forgot I bought it for them!!!"
4,"fun, but limited number of memory lists!","I love this game. I played it with my family, and we had a lot of fun. It is generally easy to play, doesn't take that long (an hour or less), isn't that hard, and is suitable for all ages. I think adults would enjoy it more than kids though.My main complaint is that to move, you have to memorize a lists of 2-5 things. Each list comes from 2 small booklets. Unfortunately after you finish all the lists in the booklet, you're screwed (sort of). There are enough lists in these booklets, and although from game to game you may forget the specific content of this list, if you play often enough it could become an issue. My guess is that after 5-10 times of playing it, you will have gone through all the lists and will have to start over. This doesn't seriously interfere with gameplay if you don't play it too often though."
1,Senior Moments Board Game Review,"My husband and I received this as a gift for Christmas from our teenage son. He had good intentions, and we had a good laugh when we received it, but when we actually played the game with some friends, we expected a little more of a challenge. A very senior person might find it a bit of a challenge, trying to memorize three out of five facts per question, but they might be better off playing Trivial Pursuit or chess."
1,Lousy Instructions,"Gave this game to my husband for Christmas and attempted to play it with friends on NYE.We are about 60 years old and 3 of the 4 of us have masters degrees. For the life of us we could not figure out how to play this game. It seems the board doesn't match the instructions and the instructions are minimal at best. Just for fun, gave it and the instructions to our youngest (27)son to see if he could come up with how to play and he just said it made no sense at all. Very disappointed."
4,Fun for the senior crowd!,"After Thanksgiving dinner, five of us 60-plus friends played the ""Senior Moments"" board game. We had a blast for 2 hours! I would recommend this game for everyone. It is guaranteed to hone your memory skills!"
2,Dissapointing,"I watched clips on youtube focusing around Boyd Bushman who was a Ceo of Locheed in the 50's, this made me want to purchase this video and see if any more information could be gained.The majority of the film centers around the story of this man and his wife who go on a mission to call down UFOs and leave the planet. Alnong the way, they meet and talk to various knowledgebable people and gather information.All the juicy bits are on Youtube. I was quite dissapointed with the long lenght of the film, the ammature techniques used and the extraneous plot scenes that just go on too long. There are two discs so its about 3 hours long with about..... 1 hour of interesting info."
1,mess of a video,"This is a dreadful mess of a video...badly filmed with a home cam feel and painfully acted by a hysterical wife and the actor. Very disappointing. However, I did enjoy the very brief moments during the film when Robert Thurman spoke."
4,Very good if you can excuse poor acting.,"This video has much valuable information from valid sources. Ignore the poor acting, and you may learn much information."
5,Good product.,This is a very nice product and it makes your skin really soft. I would recommend it to somebody else.
3,Disappointed in dispenser,"I would love to have used this product (hence the 3 star review), because the aroma is wonderful, but unable to get the pump to produce product. This could be due to the viscosity. It is VERY thick. I had to return it for credit."
5,Mmmm... chocolate-y....,"No, it doesn't taste like chocolate.. (don't ask me how i know this).. But it has a nice cocoa smell.This is my new favorite lotion, and i can even use it on my face without irritation or breakout. Feels great after a shower or after being in the sun. Makes my skin very soft but not greasy.Finally, a way to enjoy chocolate that doesn't make my butt big!"
5,A great product for thirsty skin!,"I understand this stuff is really with a mind to scarred and problem skin, it has heaps of Vitamin E which is good for helping scar tissue to heal. It smells so completely delicious it could fool you into tasting it! Excellent moisturisier and long lasting effects. Great as an aftersun!"
5,Great for an after tan lotion !,Been getting DARK for an upcoming cruise at the tanning and salon and use Palmers Cocoa Butter w/ VIT E as an after tan moisturizer. It works very well. Seems like it really penetrates deep to lock in moisture. The smell is also very delicious...like another reviewer stated...it really does smell like Vanilla Wafers.
4,cocoabutter,"I have been using Palmer's Cocoa Butter in just about every form from oils to the solid for almost 10 years. I love it, especially after I had my children. I will just say it has worked wonders for my self image."
3,not for stretch marks :(,"i've been using this for almost 4 months now and this don't work on my stretch marks, i don't see any difference but i'm giving out 3 stars coz it makes my skin soft and smell good."
4,Great product,My wife has been using this pump version in this pregnancy & is very happy with the product. We previously had the bottle top version and couldn't get through almost 1/4 of the cream which stays due to its thick consistency.
3,James Toback view of kids in America,"I had long been waiting to see ""Black and White,"" and when I finally did, I was torn between whether I liked it or not. It's hard for me to judge it because I had been waiting so long to see it. As the film opened, I thought that James Toback did an excellent job with the camera work, as well as the pen. He clearly showed the viewers the ""differences"" between the two races and how they try to intertwine. His use of witty vocabulary and camera techniques made his films deserve three stars, but the way he chose to proceed with the story and develop his ideas could have been done in a different way. As the film ended, I was wondering if this is how James Toback really sees the world, or if is just one of his fantasies. Worth watching on DVD for the deleated (and entertaining) scenes."
4,Two Faces,"I have watched this DVD several times, and that ususally means it is one of my favorites, a five star performance. In this case, however, because of the director's inability to create cohesion between his two visions of how to tell this story (these stories) I give the film only four stars.First of all, there are the films many strengths: the hip-hop world has never been better and more honestly and more non-judgmentally portrayed; Mike Tyson, Downey JR., Houston, Phillips, and Schiffer give great performances; Much is learned about the connection between affluent white kids and hip-hop culture. Deep stuff.The big problem with the movie is that it would have worked as a documentary style film, or it would have worked as a plotted detective story. When these two ideas come together, however, the gritty reality of the hip-hop world does not mesh with the necessarily artificial plot contrivances of the detective story (even though it is a pretty good detective story)."
1,5 movies in 1.,"I really didn't enjoy watching this movie, the movie started out with some very vulgar scenes to begin with. This movie had a lot of celebrities starring in it but I wouldn't be involved if they paid me. There was almost 5 different stories in 1 movie, the plot was very hard to understand and I thought the story was very poorly written. I do not recommend this movie."
1,"Demeaning, dirty sex scene.","I enjoyed the demeaning and dirty sex scene at the beginning of this film. My god, imagine if Kurosawa had introduced one of his movies with two gangsters getting their kicks in the middle of central park from two ""wigged-out"" white girls. Man, and they call Kurosawa a master. Apparently the great works of James Toback have gone completely unnoticed by the filmgoing community. It's a shame really. Here's to more ""wigged-out white girl-on girl in front of gangsters in a park"" action. Ahhh, now off to film school with me so I can mimic the greats."
2,What The....,"Ok, this movie was wierd and it was like a kid with ADD who skipped his medication just to spite himself. I liked Ben Stiller, but what in the...the...can I call it a story line??? I'm sure I couldn't do better myself, as I have skipped my medication for years( if I had meds) but I guess the one good thing that came of this movie was the Kissing climax with Brooke Shields and the 18 year old fly boy, Lij. Good job, and the song they played at the end was cool, but in general I think rap (which is a story theme) is too redundant except for old school Beasty Boys...am I dating myself? Sorry, I hope teenage girls don't get any ideas...stay away from Central Park, Ladies!!!"
2,interesting but...,"I head about it, and I just saw it. For anyone who hasn't senn this, my recommedation is to just rent one to watch, with no need to to own one. It is very interesting to see how the director mixed real and scripted plots or things together to make such a film, which in a way is pretty raw and unpolished. Also, amateur and professional actors are mingled together, which makes the stories sometimes like a documentary and sometimes not. Some acting was fantastic or hilarious, like the scene Downey with Tyson, and the scene Downey leaving Sheilds, and the blackmail detective (Stiller) scenes. I would give those actings 5 star, but for the whole film, only 2 star. It is an interesting film, which shows a lot of interesting parts and yet doesn't really seem to form an integrated film. Again, Robert Downey Jr. showed in this movie his versatile acting capacity, and played his charactor just so real, and I do wish next time, he plays a non-gay charactor in a movie for a change."
1,"Mostly plotless, totally pointless","This is what happens when you make a movie with no script. It's basically a bunch of actors arguing with each other in character. Language, sex, violence...it's all here, but none of it for any discernable reason. I think a couple of the scenes were actually written. These form what little plot there is. There is a funny scene with Robert Downey Jr. coming on to Mike Tyson, but that's about it. I'm sure the filmmaker was trying to make some really profound point, but it's totally lost in the swirling, directionless flow of ... that is this movie going down the toilet."
1,I want two hours of my life back!,"This should have been a good movie - great cast, director, the camera work is glossy and gorgeous . . . but there's just no plot. There are too many characters, and none are given any depth - as an audience you just don't care about any of them. If you're a fan of any of the cast, and are hoping to buy this to see them (like I did for Elijah Wood) then DON'T. Chances are, they'll have only a few minutes of screen time.The highlight of this movie was the sheer comedy value of watching Robert Downey Jnr flirt with Mike Tyson. The downside to this movie is . . . every other minute. And why Tyson should be given any screen time is beyond me. He is just as obnoxious and base as in real life and should not be glamourised in any form - which this movie threatens to do.I'm sure there was a noble idea behind this movie, but it seems to have been lost. Save your money."
2,Forget this!,"This gets 2 stars for having an interesting idea. In the end the filmmakers know nothing about hip hop, and even less about the young black and white people who are attracted to this lifestyle. It wasn't a movie instead it's a long drawn out essay that asks the question (literally many times)why are white kids attracted to hip hop? While all the black kids act ill without an intelligent bone in sight. Mr. Toback do some research!!!!!!"
4,Black and White,The DVD in general was good quality. The movie was okay. I would recommend it to my friends and family.
3,Good but not brilliant,"Just watched Black & White and I gotta say, 1st of all that it was worth watching but it couldn't really make it's mind up what type of a movie it was. There's some big names in there and a weird mix of actors which they could of made better use of. The storyline was all over the place and this pi**ed me off. Apart from that, it was o.k."
2,Incoherent mix,"I'm not an American so I don't know the relationships between whites and blacks, but I think both are presented at their worst in this movie. Some stupid impossible situations with no coherent flow, a lot of open sex, ""nothing sacred"" - nothing to aspire to in this movie. I bought it despite the bad reviews because I am a huge Elijah Wood fan, and I must tell you that he does shine as always, but only for a few short moments, so it's not worth your money - you will have to suffer to the end to see him kiss Brook Shields. I gave it 2 stars (and not 1)because it is not a mainstream movie, it is a bit different from everything i saw and maybe sometimes funny and interesting, but you know it's all not real."
5,Good service,"Overall good communication, good value, good customer service! Worth your money, and it is a good investment. I would recommend"
1,An Illogical Chain of reasoning,"When I read this book, I was amused by it. To say that the disorder in Africa benefits someone--e.g., via corruption--has been around for some time and is nothing new. To say that this disorder somehow makes the societies ""work"" is new but illogical. For something to ""work"" for the continent as a whole it must have positive net benefit. Right now, the disorder in Africa is such that the benefit to those who gain is far less than the loss to those who lose. This is a well-known research result. Africa doesn't work; the disorder results in a net loss to Africa. Why Africans do not do enough to change the institutional and organizational order is an interesting reasearch topic. How one can help Africans do something about this predicament is also an interesting research topic. But to say that the disorder works is illogical."
1,Has potential but definitely needs updating and editing,"What originally started as a great guide to local hikes, quickly turned into a major letdown. Though I enjoy a nice challenge at times...not just once or twice, but for three of the listed hikes we got lost and/or (as also previously mentioned) stuck in a shrub of a not-so-well-marked path. This book is definitely outdated. And not only that, the directions are not entirely clear (e.g. for the Blue Mountain and Phillips Canyon hike, it is vague that you need to return up the path you came from to continue along the Appalachian trail). So three times a charm; thanks to this book, I will now be investing in a portable GPS for my hikes."
4,Would Love an Updated Edition,"Hikes Around Philadelphia is a great title for novice hikers (like myself). It provides good maps, directions, time/distance estimates, and descriptive narrative about each hike.I've used it on three hikes and my only complaint is that it needs a new, updated edition. It was published in 1997 and some areas have changed in the last decade. I learned this the hard way half-way through my latest hike on ""The Springfield Trail"". The author might have been the last person who hiked the full trail. I was nearly trapped in vines and brambles situated between the Springfield Mall and a housing development (that was obviously built after the book was published).I still recommend the book, but you should double-check the validity of each hike using Google Maps or another source."
1,Smoky Mtn. Park vs. Smoky Mtn. region,"The Great Smoky Mountain National Park is an area of rare natural splendor. It is surrounded by the Great Smoky Mountain region which is a ... tourist trap. I bought this book hoping to find 100 secrets of the Park: the best sunrise view, the best hike for small kids, the best fishing stream, etc. The book does have a few secrets of the Park, but mostly it's about the tourist traps: the Exotic Petting Zoo, the best steakhouse, the backdoor entrance to Dollywood. If these are the things that interest you, you will like this book. However, if these are the things that interest you, then you should seriously consider vacationing in Orlando instead of in the Smoky Mountain region."
2,Try Tassimo's other crema instead...,"I like coffee and was looking forward to trying this crema, and I am not sure why, but it seems bitter to me. And I am a regular coffee / espresso drinker, so I don't think it's me. Some of the Tassimo drinks have a chemical-ly aftertaste, and this is one of them.I then tried the Mastro Lorenzo crema and it is MUCH better. You can buy Mastro Lorenzo crema at the Tassimo or Gevalia websites, though I hope Amazon will pick them up soon. They're priced about three bucks less than the Gevalia crema. Nice!(FYI to espresso fans, there's also a Carte Noir espresso at the Tassimo site which goes for three bucks less than the Gevlalia espresso, and is as good, in my opinion.)"
3,Castle Keep,Fantastic eurpean back drop. Amazing glamorous casle. Slow build up at first. Energetic but short action ending.
2,Take us to your castle!,"What a waste of an otherwise fine cast. How can it tank (pun intended) with the likes of Burt Lancaster, Peter Falk, Patrick O'Neal and Jean-Pierre Aumont? This is a war movie that can't decide whether it's coming or going. The plot - if it even exists - asks more questions than it can answer. If you are one of those war buffs, you will get enough to whet your appetite. There are explosive firefights and a little humor on the side with the fire-bombing whores and a band of anti-war (""we're conscientious objectors - we don't believe in fighting"") led by the irrepressible Bruce Dern. This movie is a series of - dare I say - loose cannons."
1,A Great Example Of Poor Writing,"This is one of those films like the emperors clothes; because it has stars, great photography, special effects, etc, many viewers think it is a worthy film. But the haphazard writing, weird dialogue, and sub plots that go nowhere mark the movie as an abject failure. The picture includes meaningless rambling dialogue. This is the kind of thing that pretentious people tout as meaningful while, in reality, it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Perhaps the worst feature of the movie is that it ends leaving the viewer without hope or satisfaction of any sort. It is not (as touted) so much a condemnation of war as a condemnation of human beings in general."
5,get it in original 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen from the UK,"Columbia has elected to release this beautiful Panavision film in a pan-scan transfer here in the USA, an abomination for which I don't recommend buying the domestic disc. But note this!Castle Keep has been released in the UK by Columbia Tristar on PAL Region 2 Disc in 5 languages (English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) and in WIDESCREEN. If you want this movie in 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and if you have a region 2 DVD player you should get it from the Amazon UK site."
1,"Thanks for nothing, Columbia TriStar","I've been waiting for Castle Keep to come out on DVD for years. Looks like I'll have to wait even longer, as Columbia TriStar decided to put out a cropped pan-and-scan version of it instead of the full anamorphic version."
1,An incredible piece of ...,"Yes it's true, Columbia has released this excellent movie in pan & scan! And to make it worse, contrary to what was said by an earlier reviewer, the original aspect ratio was not 1,85:1 but the full Panavision 2,40:1 framing (that's easy to check out, because the opening credits actually are shown in widescreen on the DVD). Well, that's it, folks, what we have here is another useless disc which all movie lovers should stay away from until Columbia finally understands what customers want.1 star because I don't have any other choice (please Amazon, make it possible to give a 'Zero star' rating!)"
4,Patton at the Alamo,"Like ""Moby Dick"", an allegorical tale suffers when it is translated to a visual medium; yet this film DOES capture the surrealism of war that author William Eastlake must have found intriguing. But an ""anti-war"" film? In my opinion is has nothing to do with pro OR anti-war...it is an examination of what people stand for; in this movie the choice is between pricelss artworks kept in the castle, and the priceless value of humantiy. How each soldier makes his choice is what this movie examines. An allegorical tale that asks you to make your own decision about what matters the most to YOU. (and the book is even better!)"
2,Very over-rated movie,"I gave Castle Keep 2 stars because I felt generous. This movie is one of the best examples of early 1970s excess. Terrible writing, directing, acting, special effects, and musical score. In this WW2 flick, everyone is wearing 70s hairstyles and has an anti-establishment perspective. It tries to capture the spirit of ""Catch-22"" but fails miserably. This is a bad movie - don't waste your time."
4,strange and amuseing,PARKER POSEY ? You poor FOOL ! She must have been about 4 years old. Go see The House of Yes again [excellent BTW] Anyway this is classic Burt at his most surreal [as in The Swimmer] This is a strange film and the VW bug circleing the in the courtyard is quite amuseing.
5,A Masterpiece,"Burt Lancaster gives a brilliant, measured performance in this anti-war film that features a top notch director ( Sydney Pollack), first rate cast ( Patrick O'Neal, Peter Falk, Tony Bill, Michael Conrad [ Sgt Esterhaus on Hill St. Blues] & Al Freeman Jr.)based on the book by William Eastlake. At times surreal, bitterly ironic and bitterly funny. It takes place during the Battle of the Bulge, as ""8 walking wounded misfits of the American Army"" try to hold a castle against the advancing German Army. Once seen, not to be forgotten."
4,Good stuff,"This book explains how EFI systems work, the inputs and outputs of ECU, and talks about diferent aftermarket ECUs, their principals.It's a good book to start understanding EFI.In my case, I already knew the EFI systems, except for the way the aftermarket ECUs work, I mean their software, so I will look for something more specific on car electronics, but still a good buy."
2,"Focuses on aftermarket EFI, Not the original system","I expected this book to talk about the original EFI system your car came with, But it suggests you go out and spend a fortune for an aftermarket EFI, and talks only about tuning them."
5,Changing from Carbs to EFI?,This book is a must if you are thinking about updating your Carburator system to EFI. It goes from what tools you will need through the different sensors that are required and has detailted descriptions of many of the aftermarket EFI systems available.
2,Just an introduction,"If you have done troubleshooting on a stock e.f.i system, you probably know most of this. If you know nothing at all, it's a start. This should have ""BASIC"" somewhere in the title so we are not mislead."
1,Not impressed...,"Teaches you nothing that you can't already learn online for free. What's the point? To add insult to injury, this guy is begging for positive reviews on Bandwagon-Tech---->honda-techDOTcom/zerothread?id=1123190Not worth the paper it's printed on if you ask me. I'm sure all the lemmings will come over here and tell you this book is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and that I have some kind of vendetta against Ben. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's important for everyone to know how they're being deceived. Don't fall for it!"
1,Book for beginners only.....,"I was extremely disappointment when I received this book. On the cover it said ""modifying fuel & ignition maps"" however; it doesn't even scratch the surface on how to tune a vehicle. I suggest to everyone who is interested in learning how to tune to purchase ""How to Tune and Modify Engine Managements Systems""."
5,Very Good technical Info & Unbiased reviews of EMS's,"I just got this book, and I must say it was all and more then I expected. The info was explained clearly and concise and dispelled alot of rumors and myths I have heard. The writing is technical and accurate but with touch of halarity with it that ade reading it over a few times to absorb everything very easy.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about EFI Engine tuning therory, it will make a great addition to any tech book collection."
4,A great beginning to understanding automotive tuning.,"Tuning a car is always a daunting task at best, especially for the novice who is just getting started in understanding everything that goes in to it.While this book is not a be-all end-all, Ben Strader has a knack for explaining the complicated task of tuning in an extraordinarily easy fashion.If you are a seasoned tuner, keep this book and show it to your customers to help them understand what you are doing to their car.If you are just getting started in tuning and want to learn more, this is the book for you!"
2,french denial of the vichy,"France,unlike britain, has a bipolar conscience regarding liberty and dictatorship. The istory of the treatment of its jewish citizens over 200 years is both liberal and right-wing antisemitic. The Drefus Affair is its most notable conspiracy against the jews. And yet, they put into power in the 1930s a left-wing jewish prime minister. When the Nazis occupied France,antisemtism once again becma acceptable. The vichy government not only handed over foreign jews from eastern europe, namel poland, they also handed over french citizens who were jews. Few french movies dealt with this shameful catastrophe. This movie is an apologetic theme for the antisemitism in vichy. Not all the criminals were prosecuted. They were allowed to live out their natural lives. This movie has an underlying antisemitic presentatiion.Tavernier's previous were artistic ,well made movies. This abomination should not have seen the light of day."
3,I used to like French movies,"The obsession of French filmmakers with the German occupation gets another airing in ""Safe Conduct,"" a scattershot, confusing and uninvolving tale of moviemakers under the thumb of the Nazis. If Tavernier had used maybe half the plot he has, it would be a much stronger movie. We keep moving back and forth between an assistant director who divides his time between working for the German-owned movie outfit and working with the Resistance; and a ludicrous screenwriter who keeps getting himself thrown out of his lovers' apartments. In the the best sequence, the assistant director steals documents out of a German officer's office, which results in him getting put on a plane and flown to England -- for a weekend. Movie and history buffs are the best audience for this middling drama, which nevertheless has richly detailed sets and costumes evoking World War II."
5,I love this book!,"I love to quilt, but don't have a whole lot of time, so this book was perfect for me. The instructions were clear and easy to read, and the pictures were great. I like that the book lies flat when opened. There are even projects that the kids can do! This is one of my favorite quilt books."
5,Christmas at the Bears Paw Ranch,"I attended a class on making a wall hanging. A lady had this book with the instructions for the wall hanging. I ordered one for me and one for my sister. I was glad to find the book. There are several items, I want to make. The price of the book was cheaper than found at a Quilt Shop,including S&H;Thanks so muchSandra"
4,Beautiful quilt book,Another great Eleanor Burns quilt book. All her books have great instructions and illustrations along with beautiful photos of the quilts.
4,Christmas at bear paw ranch,The book was in good condition and clean I was please with how quickly it was sent to me and would buy from them again.Thanks for the great book.Sandy
4,Christmas at the Bears Paw Ranch,I received this book in just a few days after placing my order.I enjoyed looking thru the book and couldn't wait to start making some of the projects.
3,If you like country...........,"then this is a book for you. The book runs 207 pages not including the many templates. It contains instructions for tree decorations, stockings, tablerunners, placemats, pillows, 7 wallhangings, 3 quilts, 4 projects for children and even a christmas jacket for Fido! Twenty-eight projects in all. However, because I don't do country, there is only one project I would consider doing. I ordered this book through the mail and had I seen it at a bookstore I wouldn't have gotten it. I gave it 3 stars because I'm sure that many of you country quilters would find it appealing.Note: I've decided to give it 4 stars!"
5,Christmas at Bear's Paw Ranch,Fantastic transaction. Books received were even better than described. Received my order quickly. I am looking forward to seeing more items by this seller.
3,A small book with short synopsis of many women,"""Living with Cannibals"" is such a promising title I had hoped for so much more than this book had. This book is comprised of multiple women's adventures. They are paired old and more recent for each type of adventure (artic, Africa, Etc). Each person is covered in about a dozen pages and includes photos (or etchings). It's not a bad book it's just really hard to make each of them sound that much different from one another in such a short space."
5,EXCELLANT MOVIE,EXCELLANT MOVIE I LOVE ALL OF HIS MOVIES AND JEAN ARTHUR HAS BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTRESSES
3,A 6 star movie,"This might be the best movie ever produced. No wonder its mandatory to watch this movie in many schools. Like 'The Wizard of OZ, White Christmas, and the Miracle on 34th Street, this should be an annual holiday movie. Maybe Memorial Day?"
2,Bad,"When I received the movie, it was not shrink wrapped. When I watched the movie, it skipped twice to where we missed a lot of the movie. The movie, itself, was very good."
2,"After 70 years, this Stereotyped Movie Really Isn't Very Good","If I was a U.S. senator, which thankfully I'm not, I'd be appalled by the characterization. Every senator (except for Jefferson Smith) is portrayed as a corrupt, petty windbag. The senate floor is inundated with overanimated children (literally) who seem to control the proceedings. The president of the senate is constantly giggling at Smith's antics and appears to be the only senator sympathetic to Mr. Smith's cause. Apparently Mr. Smith's dad wasn't much of a judge of character in his assessment of the corrupt Mr. Payne. I don't have a high opinion of politicians, but if the real ones are anything like the portrayal here, we'd be in a lot of trouble."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may have seemed incisive when it came out, but now it's dated, horribly manipulative and sentimental even for Capra (Jimmy Stewart is fighting for, of all things, space for Boy Scouts to play); it's beloved because of its uplifting take on America, not because it's actually a good movie."
5,Every politician should be required to watch this movie every year,"Yes it is rather heavy-handed, and unbelievably naive. But wouldn't we find some sincere passion rather refreshing these days?"
4,DVDs for my grandchildren,We ordered three DVDs which our granddaughters wanted for Christmas. We found them on Amazon.Com and did not have to look all over town for them. It was fast convenient and competitive in price.
5,A Great Movie,"This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best performances.Jimmy Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, a leader of a boys' group who is quickly and without warning named senator of his state. While serving he discovers that his state is being run by corrupt men and will stop at nothing to return things to the way they should be.In all aspects, this movie shines. A captivating plot, a talented cast, and a solid message. What more could you ask for in a film?"
3,Good old movie.,"This movie was good, and I wish there were more. The quality of the recording could be better. I love Jimmy Stewart and any movie by him has to be entertaining."
3,Mr. Smith,"Typical Frank Capra movie from the late 1930s - ordinary man shouts down the big wigs. It is, however, worth watching. And it might be good for young teens."
5,One of the only films that actually defends America.,"James Stewart and Jean Arthur give incomparable performances in this classic, influential comedy/drama from director Frank Capra. Boy-scout Jefferson Smith travels to Washington to fill in for a dead senator, only to discover vile corruption in the congress. Oscar for Original Story; a powerful and moving film."
5,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"A TRUE classic! If you like older movies or are into politics, you MUST watch this movie! Fits in with today's political problems! DaveC"
5,A MUST SEE FOR EVERY AGE,"ONCE AGAIN THIS MOVIE SHOWS WHAT REAL ACTORS CAN CRAFT WITHOUT SPECIAL EFFECTS. STEWARD AND ARTHUR HITS IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH THEIR SECOND PERFORMANCE TOGETHER(1).YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU)IN ""MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON"". FRANK CAPRA SHOWS THE GOOD AND THE BAD AND HOW THE GOOD DOES WIN BUT NOT ALWAYS AS YOU THINK IT WILL. CAPRA AND STEWART ARE ONE OF THE GREAT WORKING TEAMS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF HOLLYWOOD."
5,Should Be Required In U.S. Jr. Highschools,"This film is Capra's best civic lesson and best film, and should be required viewing for every junior high student in America. When your're fighting for your ideals, you're always alone, but a person with moral courage is a majority of one."
4,Good Stuff,Jimmy Stewart is an awesome actor and I loved his performance in this movie. Really good watch even if I did have to do it for a class!
5,Classroom Use,I used it with my 8th graders during the Constitution unit and they were totally engrossed!!! Great learning tool even in 2013.
4,Happy memories,This is a movie my mother has always talked about as one of her favorites. Apparently it has been on one of the movie channels but she has always missed it. It was nice to be able to find it for her. She was thrilled. She didn't know you could still find it anywhere. Now she can watch it as many times as she wants on these cold winter nights.
5,Best movie about Washington and Politics around,"I've seen this several times, and everytime it gets right down in there and gets you to feel that, maybe, maybe there's still a chance this thing called democracy can work."
5,Jimmy Stewart lights up the screen,"We have seen Jimmy Stewart play all kinds of roles: A man who comes to appreciate his family and life (It's A Wonderful Life), a man who spies on his neighbors (Rear Window), and even a man who wants to win the heart of the beautiful Katherine Hepburn (The Philadelphia Story). Now we see Stewart as a patriotic American man who goes to the Senate to represent his state. This movie reminds me of a modern day Tom cruise movie; the government trying to bash the integrity of a citizen. I enjoyed it very much, and found myself being drawn into the movie; Reacting to the injustices that I found were being dolled out to Stewart. I thought that it was a wonderful movie and would recommend it to any James Stewart fan, or anyone who appreciates a good, classic movie!"
4,A wonderful layering of walnuts and history as life,"I really liked this book because I could identify with the author on every level: artist, baker, family member. An intricately woven story of life in the 1990's as seen through the eyes of a struggling female artist and the generations of women who proceeded her. I love how each chapter ends with a recipe she struggles with during the course of the story and how food and walnuts are used as metaphors for life."
2,Nice item but not impressed with seller,"Received the item (ordered it for Christmas but it didnt ship till 1/12). When I finally got it, one of the black sections on the cross was missing. The customer service people were no help and gave me the impression I was interrupting their social life (Called twice to get another operator). I'm sending the item back today (had to pay for shipping, no UPS return label available). Overall, dissatisfied with the seller, west palm beach jewelry. Item was nice for the price but hard to read the lords prayer (looks like its there though)."
4,Lords Prayer Pendant,wife was very happy with the cross. It is larger and more decorative than the one we had looked at in Walmart.
1,Horrible,I expected so much more from this necklace. I gave it as a Christmas gift and you have to have it tilted at just the right light to read part of it and then tilt it again to read the other parts. My friend has worn it once. Very embarrased.
1,junk item's all of them,i all ready told taht i think Lord's Prayer Sterling Silver Cross Pendant that i got was no good the chain fell apart the first time my wife put it on and you chould not see the Lord's Prayer in it i also told you that i will not be sending it back because the whole thing is not wearth it and i will never buy any thing else from you thank's for nothing.all your items are junk.
2,A....yeah....not so good there Connie,"This was the first Connie Mason book I've read. I found it predictable, cheesy and silly. I think I might have dozed off a couple of times on the ol' couch while reading it too. I wouldn't recommend buying it new, but maybe you can find it for a cent in the used section. Cause that's about all it's worth to me. Now if you want to read something good...then check out Lisa Kleypas or Kresley Cole. For Lisa, I recommend the Wallflower series. As for Cole, The Immortals After Dark Series. Now those are good books, with great plots, and hot sex!"
2,Just OK,"I wasn't expecting much, but am glad someone else paid for them. They are very flat sounding and uncomfortable for an extended period of time. Using iTunes to make a pretty sharp V pattern in the equalizer makes these very usable and helps alleviate the tin can sound. If I where spending $20 on headphones I would buy an entry pair of Sennheiser's ."
1,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaawn,"Great reading material.........if you want to go to sleep. Almost makes me think he was a Univ. of Illinois graduate. Probably a rocket scientist. I suggest Mr. Berton leave NASA employment for private industry, civilian rocket ships preferably since that is where the future lies."
5,Great Gabby! Great Hawaiian Music!,"This is Gabby Pahinui, just him and his guitar. Pure Hawaiian music-no synthesizers, no strings. Gabby's voice is great throughout with his signature falsetto and outstanding guitar playing. It seems like an audition, since Gabby slugs the beginning of each song with the title and take number. I read somewhere that Dave Guard of the Kingston Trio (a native Hawaiian and big Gabby fan) shopped this to major labels on the mainland with no success. It's hard to believe this just sat around until the late 70s to be issued. Every Hawaiian music fan should own a copy of this cd. A truly great hawaiian album!!!"
3,"Good, yet needs more sample problems...","This textbook, is a good guidline for the beginner in Physics. The diagrams are useful, and is not too wordy. However an abscence of sample problems is the only downfall to this text."
1,Grill Cover Review,"The product stated ""heavy duty vinyl"", however compared to my previous grill cover that last two seasons in the Kansas City area it was very lightweight. It did look nice, was very bright red w/the Nebraska logo, but only lasted three weeks before the cold weather, snow & wind actually ripped the grill cover. When I took the grill cover off to ship back to the store, it continued to fall apart. (It was very cold during this 3 weeks, and I would admit almost record cold temps were recorded in the area).The company did honor the product and quickly refunded my money. They provided me a shipping label to ship back the defective product. So, the customer service was great."
2,Crap,I should have known better than to get a cheap grill cover. We had a hard time keeping it on. It was so light that the wind blew it away and you could see right through it. It looked good though.
2,grill cover,"My husband is from NE so I just had to order this for him for Christmas, however, it didn't make it through one season in the midwest. It ripped the 1st big storm we had and I had to throw it away. This product would be great if you lived in like CA or FL, but if you live in the midwest, the wind will destroy it."
3,lack of diversity,"Good collection, good quality of images. Unfortunately missing diversity. Most of humans are represented by Caucasians. The collection contains small number of clipart to represent culture other than Jewish and Christian. Missing ""international "" accents. I am using clipart in educational setting and struggle to find pictures to represent all American population"
3,Product Is OK,"Product is fine. Heat tends to transfer real quick when carrying items, like pans out of my smoker. Not exception but works ok"
1,Useless instead of wireless,"Never worked - install software made winXP machine freeze, called customer service which wasn't able to help...gave up, opened up my computer and went with netgear instead"
3,"Fast, furious...but a bit dated","If you want to catch an idea of how fast the electronic/dance genre keeps shifting and changing and eating its own...then you should buy this box set and the Global Underground--Sasha set in Ibiza. The former represents early rave past and the latter represents dance floor's future. Tony can mix extremely well, but this double CD package contains synth-loops and effects that may seem obselete in today's dance culture. That is not to say that it is not enjoyable...it is, but the emergence of progressive trance through other artists (Oakenfold, Sasha, Warren, Digweed, et.al) have succeeded in mixing the loop and beat science of Orbital with dance floor sensibilities. As a result, when you listen to this box set, the listener may get a little nostalgic."
5,Standing alone in the eye of the storm,A superb collection of nu-nrg/hard house tracks which build to a ferocious climax. The way De Vit (RIP) pitches up the penultimate track (Format One) to an almost insane level is worth the asking price alone.
4,high quality NU-NRG,"A really good party CD. For all Americans who are tiered of 130 BPM tracks :-), this one is fast ( 140-145 bpm ). You're gonna love it!"
4,kind of interesting,Overall I would say it's a good fun movie to watch. But it should be said the script and plot are pretty dumb.The surf scenes are cool and there are some funny things that happens .
1,Run Away. Out of center spindle holes.,"The title says it all. Place one of these in a laptop tray, spin by hand, and see a spindle hole that is 1mm-2mm out of center. Burning at anything other than very slow speeds shakes the machine dangerously. Stick with Taiyo Yuden brand if you can (any ""Made in Japan"" discs as they are the only Japanese manufacturer left). I subsequently purchasedMaxell CD-R (Photo) Pro Series With Spindle, 700MB/80 Minutes, Pack Of 25andMemorex 97998 100 Pack Cool Color 52X CD-R Spindle, and both work very well (both made in China). Stick with ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com."" to make returns easy.I have written to the seller, and will post a follow up on how they handle the situation. Sold by J&R; Music and Computer World dba NYC Electronics"
3,You record on them fine but some systems will not read the CD's,"This CD-R's work good on a PC, I have a Vaio Sony so it shouldn't be a problem but if you try these on a standard CD player only a couple of tracks will work. When I use Maxell evertything's fine."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money Most of the blanks will go to trash,"I am sitting here trying to use these in my burner to write a CD I just recorded. I am furious. Trust the people who write on here and tell you that these discs have a very high defect rate. I would say based on the experience of now having used 2, 50 packs that the reject rate runs at about 30 percent. I have never seen anything like this and it is the last time I buy blank CD's from Sony. This company should know better. Done with these blanks, they are mostly junk."
5,Great Product,"This was a great product. After finding and trying cheaper Cd's, it's great to find a product that I didn't have to throw in the garbage can because they didn't work. The shipping was extremely fast and I was pleased to receive the items quickly."
4,Almost no coasters.,"The Sony ""CD-R Music"" discs are consistently accurate. I may have had only one or two failures in a pack."
3,Sony 50CRM80RS CD-R Audio (50 pk Spindle),I was very disappointed in how this product arrived. It did not arrive promptly and when it did the spindle and seal were broken and the CD's scattered in the box. First time I've received anything from Amazon or Amazon partners in this condition. I would not recommend this product or seller.
1,be careful,"I bought these blank cd's because previous reviews stated the failure or unuseable rate was low. The first five I tried were rejected as unable to write to cd. The Memorex brand purchased at Best Buy work like a charm. Waste of money, really disappointed."
1,Sony Music CD's - Beware,"I have been burning music cd's in my 2 Sony CD recorders for several years now. Recently I bought a 50 pack of the Sony CD's. They are a disaster. Sometimes 4 or 5 in a row will not burn. And sometimes after one is burned, it will not finalize because there is nothing on them. Id a ""Sony"" Music CD will not work in a Sony recorder, what is going on? I have very few peoblems with Maxell and TDK music cd's."
5,Sony Music CD's are the ones for stand alone CD recorders,"When you have a stand alone CD recorder, you have to use blank CD's that have an OPC code in order to record on the CD. You are supposed to use Music blank CD's. Well, I've tried TDK Music blank CD's and they don't work in my Philips CD Recorder. Then I tried Maxell Music blank CD's and some work and some don't. I finally tried Sony Music CD's and hooray, they work. If you have a stand alone CD recorder, don't waste your time with TDK and Maxell, only to see some or most don't recognize the OPC code. Get the Sony Music blank CD's because they work. They have the OPC code and are recognized without a problem. Thank you Sony!"
1,NOT what it says.,"I ordered these CD's specifically for the ""digital audio"" capability. I have one of the Phillips CD Recorders from the early 2000's; I am using it to transfer cassette tapes to CD, and then the CD's to mp3's. However, the correct CD's have been hard to find. I read the reviews, and thought that surely Sony was my best bet in being correctly advertised and a quality product. Not so. I have tried 15 of them, and NONE of them have worked. The worst part is, it seems as though they work; you can record the full 79 minute capacity. However, when it comes time to finalize the disc reads ""0 Tracks"". It's infuriating! I used Verbatim CD's and Imation Cd's most recently (much cheaper too); however, technology has moved so far as to make these types of CD's rare to find anymore. Guess the hunt goes on."
1,Is there any cd-r or cd-rw that works? I got a 5-n-1 to copy vinyls and cassetts.,"I had Memorex CD-R and Sony CD-RW - both are supposed to work, but tech emphatically stated I must use Sony CD-R, so I'm going to try... the 5-n-1 will probably be returned. Nothing but trouble. It's a new problem every time. My question is why there are so many 'types' of cd's and no glossary anywhere to explain what their 'letters' mean. My vinyls and cassetts are dear to me and I would like to listen in my car which does not have a tape player, Newer model car only has CD. Very ticked off. !!!Do I need a PHd to find out about these crazy CD's??? I like cd's from the bank much better. :)"
2,quality,"I've used Sony blank cds before and didn't have any problems until I received this batch. So far two of the five cds that I'verecorded have either blanked spaced or skipped for a moment or so ??? I don't why, maybe I have a bad batch ? I've cleaned my recorder seveal times with the same results,what can say. Since I have them I""ll continue to record and hope for the best.Ed"
2,Awful!!!,"I bought these to make CD's from my iTunes playlists. I have thrown at least half the cd's away because they fail to burn. It seems the first cd is always a fail the second cd is a 50/50 shot. I bought them because the price seemed reasonable, but the old saying ""You get what you pay for"" rings true here."
4,Managing Change,This book came in really handy for my dissertation on change management. Very straight forward.
5,Managing Change and Transition,"Best text on managing change I have encountered. A great addition to my management and leadership collection! Rita Shaw Rone, Ph.D."
5,No 4 and No 5 rifles,Excellent. This is the definitive coverage for both of these rifles. Has been a tremedous asset in evaluation of rifles on sale.
4,No. 4 mark I Lee Enfield rifle,"Having used this rifle as a cadet back in the mid-seventies, and also as a member of the shooting team at school, the book held strong memories for me. But more importantly, it helped me to identify the recent purchase of a No.4 Mark I/2. The book is easy to read, I would have preferred more photos and diagrams because those unfamiliar with the rifle, may find discriptions difficult to follow. For the collector, this book is a must, to add to the others in the series."
4,Excellent price & service,"Bought as a birthday gift for my gun loving brother, not an expert myself but he thought the book was terrific. From my part I found the service excellent as was the price, far less than I would have had to pay in UK even with postage included, this has been my experience with a number of book purchases from Amazon.com, long may it continue!"
5,Can't give enough praise on this manual,"This has to be the absolute BEST overall manual and marking/identification book you can ever buy if you own a Lee-Enfield No. 4 or No. 5 rifle. I bought my own No. 4 Mk 1 for $200 a few years ago, and while the exterior is definitely NRA-grade good, the barrel is near mint condition, and it's been a pleasure to own this rifle...AND to also know it's entire pedigree in regards to the mfr. stamps and markings you'll find all over these beautiful guns. Like the Mosin Nagant and M1 Garand manuals, this one goes into very great detail about the different variants, how and where to find markings, etc., and yet it never overwhelms the reader like some manuals do. It's a bit light on the historic side, but definitely an improvement over what you typically find with other how-to manuals. Overall, it's my most favorite surplus rifle manual in this series that comes from this particular publisher. A MUST HAVE for any owner of one of these fine weapons!"
1,Unhappy,"I was looking for a student workbook for practice in spanish. I ordered this book because it was listed as ""like new"",it took me almost three weeks to get it and when I did I found the worksheets for the first five chapters were cut out. I am now approaching my first term exam for those same chapters and have no book to review."
5,It is a great biography,It was good for my project and a good read. I was interested in everything in it.! (The robots voice if you listen to it was very boring)
3,Knife sanctuary,My knives are safely tucked away. Safe from harm and safe from harming anyone. Room for six small knives and 6 large ones. The wood looks fine to me and is not splintered. I have more room on my counter now the knife blocks have been removed. I like it.
3,"Too many gear discussion, few art appreciation","Though the title may capture the audience, the book itself is not much different from other photo technique books. I bought this book for some nice photo in their but that only the photo I found at bookstore. Other photo are completely mundane. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone. If you want to see more art appreciation book, you may look at Freeman Patterson book."
2,Disaponted,"In my opinion this book does not serve a functional purpose for either beginning nor advanced photographers. It seems as if the author had a pile of unused photos (mostly snapshots, taken while traveling)and decided to write something about the pile. He mentioned that it took 3 months to assemble the book and it shows. There is little continuty between topics, there is virtually nothing on composition and what data that are presented are not very useful. I do not reccommend this book!"
1,It won't teach you anything about tao or photography,"While this book is filled with some pretty pictures, none of the actual writing contains any substance that will teach you anything about tao or photography. The author just keeps making analogies to yin and yang, most of the time not explaining what he means.I guess that if your purpose if just a pretty book for the coffee table, this might do, but then again there are so many better choices in the same price range, such as Cartier-Bresson's ""A Propos De Paris.""If you are really interested in tao and photography then check out the book by Cross & Shapiro with the same title as this one. If you're just interested in improving your photography, and not necessarily about tao, then check out ""Learning to See Creatively"" by Peterson."
5,Great!,"Like the other from this author, this is an awsome cookbook for those living gluten-free. Recepies are easy to follow and turn out consistantly well."
5,The future,This is a very healthy way to go. Less calories in gluten free products and for those who are allergic to gluten this book is great.I would recommend this book.
1,Cannot review..book has not been received.,"I would love to review this book for you but it has not been received as of today, October 24, 2012.This was a gift for a family who has gluten allergies and could put it to good use. My daughter has seen this book and ask for it. She is still waiting for it to arrive."
4,Healthy Recipes = Healthy Food,"Whether it's chicken pot pie, pizza, muffins or even white bread (using rice flour instead of wheat flour), this book has an impressive list of non-gluten/wheat-based recipes for everyday foods."
4,"Please, Fox, give us your best!","""The Big Trail"" and ""The Quiet Man"" are clearly the two best of John Wayne's films. Fox has relegated ""The Big Trail"" to the trash heap . . . considering ""old"" to be worthless. Should the folks at Fox figure out the ""pure gold"" that they have, they would put this classic on DVD in its entire original format, with the ENTIRE CLOSING MUSIC, without dropping a single frame of the original. I, for one, would purchase a few of a complete DVD, should Fox ""figure it out"" and step up to their responsibilities. Fox, that film is not improving with age. It's time you get busy and save this masterpiece before it's too late. If you wish, you could even add a second DVD as a bonus (at extra price) giving a history of the making of the movie . . . whatever. Thousands of us will pay the price. You have a diamond in your hands, and are treating it like a ""rhinestone""."
2,where's the rest of it?,"Where's the widescreen version? And why, when it's officially listed as 125 minutes in the ""flat"" version is this DVD release 108 minutes?Shame on Fox."
3,The Duke is now John wayne.,"Yes it is a classic. Yes, there is a lot to recommend this movie. But hey, it was made nearly 70 years ago and watchability is a factor. It is a little distracting to watch something this old. But savor the scenery, savor the Duke and savor the lack of foul language."
4,Very Good Movie,When you watch this movie you will be surprised to see how much is done.Everything was done by hand. No computer models or fill ins. All the equipment & people used are amazing. Watching John Wayne you can see bits of the future John Wayne. The story line is good & it's such a joy to watch. So sit back & watch a 1930 movie.
4,Big (Duke) Trail,"The movie is, at times, lethargic and the subplot is pretty lame, but...The Duke is breathtaking in his early 20s.The cinematography is stunning, and when you watch the special features you will know why.Suupporting cast members look like they have gone thousands of miles on those wagons-- and they have, in real life!I think I was almost as exhausted as the players, by the end of the film.And, oh yeah, the widescreen version is (dare I say the word again) breathtaking."
3,A Pioneer Effort for Sound,"This film is one that bridged the gap between silent and sound films. You can see Walsh's efforts to tell the story with silent film direction and bridge story gaps using the silent title cards to set the mood of the scene. The acting is still very broad and the camera somewhat static, but John Wayne's charisma shines forth in his performance. Also, note that this is one of the last performances of Tyrone Power, the father, not the son who would become a major star of the forties. There are scenes in this film that Hollywood would never be able to create again. It ranks up with ""Red River"" as a major western epic."
2,Wrong Aspect Ratio,"Contrary to other reviews, the widescreen version of this film is the one to have and I am stunned that 20th Century Fox didn't release it on DVD. The original 70mm Fox Grandeur Version of this film was restored by UCLA and aired on AMC, letterboxed, at an aspect ratio of approximately 2:1. This was the original aperture/original image size - the widescreen version of the film was not a matted version of the full screen as stated on this review page. In fact, simultaneous versions of the film were shot in both aspect ratios. While I appreciate the release of this timeless classic, I am very disappointed at the presentation. As the first American sound epic shot widescreen, it deserved better treatment. Very sad."
4,The Big Trail,"This is the film that should have made a star of John Wayne - But did not.Having watched it several times since I purchased it I really am at a lossto see why. I have now seen both the standard screen version and the widescreen and, although the widescreen was not shown in many cinemas at thetime due to the need for special projectors (unlike Cinemascope where onlyspecial Projector lens are required) the film itself does not lose a lot bybeing shown as standard. It is an extremely good story with plenty of actionand great scenery and the acting well above the norm. for the time it was made. Tyrone Power (in his last film) is excellent as a baddie and John Wayne is a cracking hero-as good as he has ever been. I rate the film 8 out of 10, and not to be missed."
2,What a dissapointment.,This is one of the very first widescreen films ever made. To be forced to see it in pan and scan is a real drag. I already have it on VHS so this DVD is a major dissapointment. Boycott this disc until Fox gets wise and offers a widescreen version. Give us the historic widescreen version.
1,The Big Rip Off!,The release of this film does not rate even a one. I cannot believe after waiting all these years for this film to be released in widescreen and on DVD. The studio releases a cut version that's been formated. WHAT THE HELL!! The only people who would really be interested in seeing this film are film buffs who only want to see there films unformated. Have the home video people not learned there lessons yet with the Willy Wonka incident. WE WANT WIDESCREEN NOW!! The public demands it. Stop wasting our time and yours.
4,Great rack,"I commute 5 times a week about 40-50 miles round trip carrying one bike. After a horrible experience with a ""budget"" bike rack, I went to the bike store and purchased this one based on their recommendations. It is a great rack! Very sturdy and holds my bike in place. The only con is that I cannot open my trunk when the rack is on (I drive a Kia Rio), but I do not use it much, so it's not that big of a deal. Great purchase."
3,Nice product but mislead re: vehicle versatility,"I was very disappointed when I opened the box and took out the manual which said that the rack was not recommended for my type of car. In the Amazon description, it said it fit most cars, when in fact it wasn't recommended for my husband's car or my neighbor's car either. The return process was relatively seamless except for the inconvenience. I think there should have been a way to check the manual first to make sure that it is recommended for your car. The manual could have been scanned for shoppers to view. It would have saved a lot of time and hassle."
2,Not exactly confidence inspiring,"purchased for a 2 week vacation - for 2 bikes - to be driven over 1500 miles. managed about 2 miles. wasnt convinced that the thing would stay on. bikes were rocking like crazy - checked the fitting several times. gave up and got one that attaches to a tow hitch. difference was night and day. perhaps on a different shape car (we have an SUV) or with a lot more time and patience it would have been ok ... but if unsure, spend the money and get a tow hitch one."
3,Does it fit or not???,OK - So I'm researching about buying this bike rack. I just happen to own an Audi A4 Wagon and the picture on the listing here at Amazon and other sites actually show the rack mounted to an A4 wagon. But when you look at the installation directions for the rack it says that you shouldn't use the rack on an A4 wagon because there's no safe place to secure the top straps. What??????
2,Factory Defect,"My latest purchase on Amazon was the worst. First there was the shipping, which I guess was my fault for not reading the fine print, but if you click on the super saver shipping then you may have a longer wait while they find which warehouse its in and wait for their weekly pick up at that warehouse, which delays the shipment. Next when I did finally get the item, the box looked as if I wasn't the first owner. I opened the package and placed the bicycle rack on my car only to find the rack had a defect in it(confirmed by a local bike shop). I personally think the item had been shipped to someone and they returned it and then it was shipped to me, though I have no actual fact of the matter."
1,Very Very bad bike rack,"I have owned this bike rack for over a year, and with light use, pieces just keep braking off this thing. It is made with a lot of plastic, and plastic and bike racks don't go together. Since I have bought this, the back ""plastic"" piece that keeps the holders on came off while on the highway, almost lost both bikes at 70 MPH. The adjustable angle section, which is the large plastic piece that holds all the pipes together, kept braking through the holes, one by one. Long and short, i have learned my lesson. I will never by a bike rack with ""plastic"" pieces again."
5,World Class Bike Rack,"I go to a lot of big road bike events and ride road bikes several thousand miles a year. I looked at a lot of other racks at events and talked to the people were using them. This is one of the the most sturdy, stable and well detailed racks available. The robust rubber stays and guides keep the bikes securely positioned and protected. If you are going to put very expensive road bikes on a car rack, you can afford the best rack."
3,Paper smell and taste...switched back to white filters.,We have now had our Chemex for 100 days while using the round folded white Chemex filters. We LOVE love our coffee when made in the Chemex. Its truly our favorite. We really liked the idea of the unbleached filters so I bought a few boxes. Using the same coffee we have been using for the last few months we brewed our first cups and took a sip....YUCKy! Our coffee was not good anymore. We were so sad. There is definitely a paper smell of the actual filter and there is also a bitter paper taste to our coffee. But we didnt give up there though. We tried rinsing the filters first and also tried different coffee. Im so sad to report that we took our unbleached filters back and exchanged them for the white. :(
3,They work,"The unbleached filters work well, but leave a bit of a cardboard taste. I would recommend the bleached filter squares."
2,The cone shaped are probably better,Don't know why we chose the squares but they seem to hold a lot of water back. Can't use regular filters as they just fall apart at the seems no matter how careful. Will need to purchase their special cone shaped ones.
1,one star is for the exorbitant price,You can buy the exact same filters in the same amount for $8 at Williams-Sonoma. I have no idea why i would spend $15 here.
5,Fred in Va,These filters are designed to be used with a Chemex coffee kraft. I have been using them for over 30 years and they make excellent coffee. I tried to order them directly from Chemex and they were out of stock for over two months. The price on Amazon was better than a direct purchase from Chemex.
5,Chemex Coffee Filters,"Chemex coffee filters really do work well. These filters are a perfect fit for the six cup Chemex coffee pot, but can be used with other drip type coffee makers."
5,Love it!,"Great product, Chemex has renewed my excitement with coffee as a cool product and delicious results. I haven't tried the round version of the filter but might when I run out."
4,"Work great, but the coffee drips slow","I was somewhat surprised to find that it's one large filter folded in quarters that you then spread into a cone (one side of the filter thus has 3 sheet's thickness and the other side has one). Otherwise, the filters work great - definitely heavier than cheaper filters like Melitta. The coffee does drip very slowly through, though."
5,The Real Deal,"Purest Coffee I've ever tasted. If it's good enough of Intellegensia and those other pro outfits, it's good enough for my boo."
5,Perfect and chemical free,Love these chemex coffee filters. Never an issue with the taste of the coffee. Durable in the hottest of the water.
3,Chemex Coffee Filters,"In the past, these were true cone-shaped filters. not the square of filter paper received on this occasion. In spite of that, they work well."
3,Nothing Good Lasts Forever,"These are really good coffee filters--WERE really good--and we've used them to make drip coffee for decades. However, these unbleached filters (and the new white ones as well) must have been produced by a new manufacturer or supplier, or made to a cheaper formula... they're just a different texture than they were in the past which seems to clog somewhat and slows the drip. Too bad. Fast shipping, tho."
2,"Love the Chemex System, Hate this Paper","Look, I love Chemex, but my coffee tastes like paper now. I may have just received an old box of filters, but they honestly ruin the taste of my coffee."
3,"looking for options, this is very expensive for the product",I love the coffee pot but the filters are way out of line (price wise) I'm looking for a replacement
1,L.V. Gerstner,"There's a lot of fiction in this document. Hopfully, some of the folks that Lou forced out of IBM in an effort to pad his lifetime income will also provide input. Folks who have a positive view of Mr. Gerstner's account of his results in turning IBM around, are not aware of the lives he ruined in the process. If you sack enough people, the results are bound to reflect a temporary profit. As a work of fiction, this book would have five stars. However, based upon facts, it is grossly lacking."
1,On the Backs of Employees,"Little Lou did his ""magic"" by cutting employee medical care, cutting employee retirement benefits, cutting employee vacation time, and finally... cutting employees! He stopped training and investing in people. If you didn't have current skills, you were fired and someone younger and more naive was hired, for a while...Ya, what a genius!"
1,Elephants Can't Dance,"Never forget that Gerstner was one of the big dog tobacco executives before he came to IBM.Although he was not one of the tobacco executives who took an oath and swore before Congress that he did not believe that tobacco was addictive, he ran the company just before the time of that testimony. Tobacco was known to be addictive since at least 1932 according to the tobacco companies' own records.Before you believe anything that Gerstner wrote or (more likely) had ghostwritten for him, always keep that in mind."
4,Winner takes all!,"Great story telling on the Mainframe decision, selling unproductive assets, creating a new board, a global service enterprise, resetting the corporate compensation, acquiring Lotus, unstacking the stack, emergence of E-business, leading by principles, execution strategy, and elephants can dance. Much praise on Larry Ellison, Scott McNealy, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Andy Grove.... For the thousands of ex IBMers that lost jobs under his watch, one can read all the negative reviews here at Amazon.com. If these people work for one of them (Ellison, McNealy, ....), they will lose their jobs in a week.This is 2003. Wake up, your guys. There is only one winner in any end game. Having said that, I would like to see a book on the inside take of IBM, about some of the missed opportunities."
1,IBM's Role in the Holocaust,"Louis Gerstner's book does more than make short shrift of the company's greatest software challenge, that is the crisis with OS/2. The book also completely avoids any mention of the greatest moral crisis to grip the company when in February 2001 the world learned that IBM had become Hitler's willing efficiency expert during the Holocaust, from 1933 to 1945. IBM technology organized the concentration camps and the Extermination by Labor campaign. Instead of simply owning up to the history and apologizing, IBM, under Gerstner, blocked access to records, launched a disinformation campaign, refused to apologize to survivors and consistently claimed the firm simply had no information on the topic. The Hitler-era crime and the 21st Century cover-up forever tarnished IBM. Yet Gerstner has conveniently deleted the entire matter from his chapters. The elephant danced around the topic completely."
4,Great book for Business Students,"Our graduate level class was studying various business models, new and old. This book is a great example of how a man came into a dying business and transformed its business model. I know Gerstner has many critics...but the bottom line is...he saved the company. He did it by reinventing the way IBM did business. I was very impressed with this book. It's worth the money."
1,Another insider opinion,"Lou does a fairly good job with the history of IBM except when it comes to his term in office. He also has good self esteem, but he definitely needs to get a second opinion. Looking back there is no question he did this for the money and he has left a trail of many angry employees in his wake. I for one can tell you the turnaround was occurring before he showed up to take all the credit. He never responded to any of my emails while I was an employee and hasn't responded to any since my retirement. HR did respond to the emails that I submitted and their response was that ""it was OK that I had sent the email to Lou"". HR then went on to reiterate the company line. Lou was not good for IBM or it's employees, he only filled his pockets with our money and left it in shambles.."
2,Over simplified and superficial,"If you are looking for a condensed version of IBM highlights under Gerstner's lead, this book will meet your needs. If you are interested in gaining an understanding of IBM's issues that led to the ""elephant"" stumbling, and Gerstner's solutions, you will be disappointed.""Who says..."" is a quick read with a superficial treatment of the various issues facing IBM and a simplified view into Gerstner's techniques to turn the company around. Many different scenarios are rushed through, leaving the reader wanting to know more about how and why. The solutions offered by Gerstner and his team seem pat--surely there was more going on.Gerstner can not answer all his critics or the legion of angry ex-IBM'ers in a single book, particularly so close to his career transition. Unfortunately, this book misses the opportunity to provide the reader with anything more than a superficial insight into one man's view of IBM."
3,More about history than management,"While this is a good book of an historic turnaround, there is little one can take away and apply. Between Gerstner's excessive modesty and the way he focuses more on his actions than the reasoning behind them, there is not much to learn here. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable story."
1,More Wool,"Why is it that one of the most hated CEOs of all time is being lauded in the press still? Did every person who made it rich do so by morally ethical means? Has no one read the Wall Street Journal? When I see a balanced story on what happened at IBM during the times of Gerstner, then I'll believe that someone did their homework, and wasn't out to ride the coat tails of another rich person. If you want another glamour story read this, if you want the truth, dig deeper."
3,What happens when a customer takes over IBM?,"This best seller by IBM's former CEO and erstwhile customer gives you a glimpse. When Louis Gerstner asked his mainframe team to drop prices and drop them hard, he was barely 45 days into the company - and the finance folks gulped hard.The new CEO was certainly not taking the easy way out. What would follow would be documented in history as one of the greatest turnarounds in the technology business. In his autobiography this brilliant man, son of a milk truck driver shows us how his company rose from the verge of extinction to the pinnacle of the industry."
3,A good look at a company that needed a chagne. Could have given more info though!,IBM was a company that had begun to flounder after designing the first business computer. Louis Gerstner Jr. takes you inside his historic turnaround at IBM to show that culture can be changed. From not offering the high placed salaries to a culture where not everyone's job is secure were all remarkable to the folks at IBM. You really get an inside look at the company during his tenure and this book is invaluable if you are trying to study the computer industry.
1,I ARE GREAT AND WONDERFUL!,"As a 35 year IBMer, I survived the Cookie Monster years. I found this book very shallow and self-serving. It may have been written to justify to the author, in his own mind, why he destroyed what was once the best corporation in the world. He glosses over the 100,000 people he laid off and never even addressed the rape of the pension plan. Forutnately, I didn't buy this book, it was a gift so no more of my money went into his pocket."
3,Could have been much better,"Considering the career path that Lou Gerstner has followed, this book doesnt come close to its potential.That being said it is an interesting book about the turnaround for IBM and a few key insights of a high level CEO is shared with the reader. The book never comes really under the skin of neither IBM or Lou Gerstner, but ofcourse thats an opening for a sequal."
4,Memoirs of An Arrogant Genius,"Gerstner is arrogant but with good reason. He knew what to do and did it, however unpopular it was. He was brought in to save this company (and protect its shareholders) from the foibles of the career IBMers who, without malice, were destroying what the Watsons had created. He wasn't there to protect jobs or careers. Gerstner rightly saw that IBM should not be a welfare program for ""loyal"" employees; it had to be a productive and profitable enterprise and he did what was necessary. Good for him. Genius is always hard to pin down but I have no doubt that this man is a genius and ""Elephants"" gives great insight into his thinking and actions. (But it also makes clear that, as Shakespeare might say of Lou, ""The milk of human kindness does not flow through his veins.)"
1,Who Says Elephants Can't Dance-??,"During the 1990's every computer company did well. I believe that Gerstner did a good thing when he expanded into the Global Services Unit. But I would not go as far as saying that he ""saved"" IBM corp from going bankrupt! He failed to mention how selfish and cruel he is in his book. He forgot to talk about the jet that he took as a going away gift from IBM corp upon retirement...In addition, he took an apartment in Manhatten, a large bonus, stock options just to mention a few. While he took from the corporation others had major salary cuts and layoffs. People have committed suicide because they lost their jobs. I didn't see any of that in his book about saving a company...at what cost!! He is the most hated and most selfish CEO. IBM employees all over the world cringe at his ""good business"" practices. I would recommend that you read this book at the bookstore. Don't buy it."
2,Corny,I dont like this at all...i didn't think it was fun at all and the girl that leads the work out is annoying to me
4,There's fun in exercising,I love the moves on this video. The variety makes it fun. Jennifer makes it lively. I enjoy working out with this video. Not too long either. Runs about 40 mins of exercising.
3,"Easy to follow, but a little dull","Being a fan of the Yoga and Pilates DVD's that ""Crunch"" has, I thought that I would try branching away from my usual ""FIRM"" workouts and give this cardio a try. I'm not really excited about what I found, but I don't hate it either. It's just kind of... dull.This starts off with a short warm up and stretch, then goes into three different dance ""parties"": salsa type moves, hip hop type moves, and something called retro, that I have not really seen much of in my lifetime anywhere. (The instructor must have been to different clubs in her heyday than me!)The quality of the videos are high, produced well with a nice workout studio background. Jennifer, the instructor, is easy to follow and has a lot of rhythm that I wish I had. Personally, I probably look more like a funky chicken than a funky dancer when I am doing this. But I stayed moving, and bottom line, I sweated.Is this something that I will rotate in my workouts like the other ""Crunch"" workouts that I have. No."
4,great seller,This came fast and it was in great condition. My wife loves the DVD and it was exactly what the seller said it was.
3,Good enough,I bought this at the same time as another dance video. We liked theother one better. However this one was good too.
2,"Mediocre, Confusing","I met Jennifer Galardi on Exercise.Tv , and I really liked her short, 10-minute standing abs routine. Unfortunately, her instruction on this DVD is forced and cheesy. She says aggravating things that really detract from the workout in her attempt to be ""hip"".There are three dance portions, which are all different lengths and have no clear beginning or end until the cut-screen comes. I enjoy most of the moves, and it will get your heart rate up, but Galardi seems to lose track sometimes and randomly begin a new movement with no warning.This is a fun occasional workout, but there are better available."
2,way too hard,"If you aren't a dancer than just forget it. They say EASY TO FOLLOW dance moves? I think not. I take a zumba class at my gym 3 times a week, THAT is easy to follow. This video is a waste. I did it 6 times, I could never get the hang of it."
2,Another reviewer who had trouble following this DVD...,"I read a lot of reviews stating that people had trouble following the moves, but it seems overall most people had fun trying. Well, I did not. I've had some dance experience so I'm not a total newbie. However, the instructor takes very little time to show each move. I understand this is necessary in order for it to be a cardiovascular workout, but I think it could have been done in a better way. Perhaps less moves per ""routine"" or less complicated moves overall.I can't say I was impressed, I was more frustrated then anything because they went to fast for it to be possible to catch on. I more or less just kept walking in place with a few hops, etc. and looked like a fool.I'll give the DVD a few more chances (and update my review as necessary) to see if it gets easier with more practice of her moves, but I'm not very motivated to do so as they looked a bit cheesy to begin with."
2,Way Too Easy,"This is a competent, fun dvd. However, it focuses mostly on choreography at the expense of sweat. Let's put it this way: I'm a semi-regular exerciser, but I'm also fat - and I barely breathed hard. It's a fun workout if you just want to get your [...] off the couch and do something for a half hour, but not so great for a serious cardio workout."
4,Definitely Not for Beginners,"My DVD just arrived today and I tried it out as soon as I got home. I have to say that it is not a good video for a beginner and/or someone who does not catch on to moves quickly. The steps are broken down but they are done so very quickly. Also, the instructor is pretty cheesy with her ""attitude"".However, I was definitely sweating by the time I finished the video and felt like I really had worked hard. The video is fun. I used to own all of the ""MTV The Grind"" workout videos, and I would compare the level of difficulty to those.This is 1 of 3 Crunch videos I own and am very satisfied with them. They have a good variety of body styles reflected in the participants and they make exercise fun."
3,Meh...,"Well, the moves aren't hard but they get your heart rate up. That's why this gets 3 stars. Ms. Galardi gets on my nerves though. I suppose it's just a trait of the aerobics instructor though not all video instructors get on my nerves. She's just so peppy. Ugh. But, if pep doesn't bother you then have it."
2,FUN WORKOUT!!!,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD DVD. IT'S REALLY FUN. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO BURN CALORIES AND WORK THE MID-SECTION. IT'S NOT HARD. I CAN'T DANCE AND I FOUND THIS DVD VERY EASY TO FOLLOW, PLUS IT'S LOW IMPACT. YOU WILL NOT BE OUT OF BREATH AND THE TIME WILL GO BY SO FAST."
1,Total disappointment..!!!,"Cheesy instructorthe instructor's voice covers the music in the background which turns you off going on with the exercize, the music itself is monotonous and the beat is not inline with the moves. the instructor is too fast to follow..to cut it short i do not recommend this for anyone ..totally not professional."
1,lost,"I don't have any dancing skills, but I'm not particularly unfit, and I'm 26, so it seems I should be able to make it through more of this than I did. I was SO lost! I hate this DVD. It glares at me from the shelf, reminding me that I wasted money on it and it doesn't do anything. The closest I got to a work-out was flailing about like a moron. I thought I'd learn some moves. I don't really even want to learn how to do whatever she was doing. :-("
3,"Great video, but..........",I will probably never use it. Dance steps are way too fast. It is impossible to learn them.
2,Too complicated to get a good workout,I found that I didn't really get a good workout because I was too busy trying to follow the moves. The lead dancer was the stiffest of the bunch and very fake in her enthusiasm.
2,"Confusing steps, annoying instructor","Too muich camera time was spent on waving arms and smiling faces. While the time passed quickly, I found the steps very confusing, as they were not explained. I found that it was slighlt easier to figure out some of the steps by ignoring the flashy arm movements. However, there were barely any close-ups on the lower body and the steps. In general I found this to be frustrating.Also, the chirpy instructor was distracting. I'm sure this could be a quick, fun workout for some one who already knows the steps and the lingo. I have the Crunch fat-burning Pilates, which breaks down movements for easier learning. I wish this DVD did the same."
3,Good if you can follow directions,"This DVD will make you sweat. It will also make you laugh at how ridiculously energized these people are. You'll laugh at the really, really corny dance moves. As long as you don't take yourself too seriously, you'll do just fine.One thing: the first time I watched I did have a little trouble following some of the dance moves, but the more you watch the dvd the easier it is to get the steps."
4,"very fun, easy workout!!!","I really liked this workout, at first it was hard to follow the moves and i was all over the place, but i kept on movin'! then, after using the video one or two more times i started to get it down. by the time i was done i was all sweaty and had had a great workout! very fun!!!"
4,Great workout...give a try (or two),"I love this DVD. However, the first time I did it I got so frustrated, I kicked the couch. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I finally went and took a Saturday morning to take the time to learn all the moves by constantly rewinding. It paid off. I sweat a lot to this! The more YOU PUT INTO IT the MORE YOU GET OUT! Let it go a little, and you will feel the sweat! I would suggest actually watching this workout through before attempting. (That is something I NEVER do...but I wished I had with this one!) It does become mush easier as time goes on...give it time! Since doing this workout, I have added on another 2 dance workouts without much trouble. Once you master one, the others don't take as much time (with the exception of ""Dance of the Inches""--still having trouble with that one!I love the choreography...love the instructor (just picked up her Prevention dance workout). Stick with it!! It gets me in such a good mood!"
4,Definitely a workout!,"It's kinda hard to keep up w/ the moves, especially if you're a beginner. But I definitely felt the burn! Even though I couldn't do all the things they were doing & at the right times, I still got quite a workout just trying to keep up w/ them. The front of my thighs were burning from the lunges they added into the dance routines. Definitely a keeper if you're trying to burn calories."
2,It doesn't burn fat!,"This is a fun DVD with lots of dance movements. It's fun to learn if your purpose is on dancing. However, the movements are so mild that you won't burn your fat just by dancing these movements. Not even mention to sculpt or tone your body."
4,Shocked by the bad reviews,"I love this dvd. I get bored really quick and im not a huge fan of cardio. I dont feel like im doing cardio tho, just having a fun time dancing.I didnt think the moves were complicated at all. And the ones that were, i got down by the 2nd/3rd viewing of the tape.for those that want a moderate cardio workout this is for you."
3,Fun but not a great work out,"I love Jennifer Galardi. She is fun and up beat, but definitely a dancer and some of her moves are hard to follow. This video is great if you want to learn to dance but its not over all a great work out...Try her 10 min solutions video for more cardio and slightly easier moves."
2,Run away ..,"I have to agree with some of the other posts. This girl is very ...very cheesy. I know a little about dancing. I could not put out my own video, but this is not as easy as it claims to be. ""At All"" I do not like the video. I normally do not remeber the names of the people on the video, but I know her name. When I see ..I run away."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"If you like good dance music, or you just want to pick up some new moves, this DVD is not for you. The moves are very basic and you would have to be a complete beginner to get anything new out of the instruction. Since I can't get my money back, maybe I can help someone else save theirs."
3,How to get Ahead in baby book sales,"When my darling baby boy, Joneseykin Luther III, was born with a visibly conical head, my wife Henrietta and I contemplated flushing him. The ""doctor"" suggested donating the baby to ""researchers"" in N.Kor. We looked into it, but the shipping costs are outrageous!!!! Luckily, Amazon has free shipping so we got this book instead.This book is amazing. The results can be whatever you want them to be. For us, asymmetry has always been a respected design idiom, so we went with a ""flock of seagulls"" meets ""isoceles"" look. The perfect off-centre balance to an otherwise boring round head.Highly Recommend!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Hey, anyone here ever see the","I'm sure the author is well intentioned but anyone who thinks they need this book should really get a life. Sure--it's all good fun until little Timmy ends up with a point at the top of his head and can only sing ""Me and My Arrow"" in an endless loop, while drooling. And it'll all be because his mom & dad thought this book was the solution to the funny, sorta lumpy way Timmy's older sibling's head ended up."
2,Carmichael?,"These songs represent a good selection of Hoagy's work. However, I would point out that they ARE NOT performed by Hoagy. The description does not point out that they are ""interpreted"" by other performers - none of which I had heard of before reading the back of the CD. It may well be that I don't listen to their genre, but I think mentioning the performers might have been a reasonable expectation. Hoagy is always good, but I was looking or should I say listening for Mr. Carmichael."
3,A classic rendered merely great because it's too timid,"Frank Capra's least Capraesque film. Lost Horizon certainly stands out from the rest of his oeuvre. While many of his films involve a certain wide-eyed optimism about the world, in this one he actually built a place to embody those beliefs. Shangri-La is beautifully realized in this movie with its waterfalls, open air schools, animals, abundance of food and shelter and the relative absence of malice and class struggle. Lost Horizon tends to dwell on the idyllic for too long. George's loathing for the place seems completely out of left field. Why isn't he won over like everyone else? I would assume his love interest had persuaded him, but what drives her hatred for the place? Had these questions been explored a great movie could have been a classic."
2,Book MUCH better!,"I love the book Lost Horizon. I love Frank Capra movies. I found Lost Horizon, the 1937 film, extremely unsatisfying. Nearly every extra thing they added (that wasn't in the book) was terribly lame. The new characters, the romance, the flirty horse chase scene. Awful. And the monk, instead of being mysterious and mystical was down right creepy. The beginning starts out ok. Ronald Colman is obviously an accomplished actor. Edward Everett Horton (another character addition not in the book) was a terrible attempt to insert some Bugs Bunny-esque into the script. I suggest just re-reading the book again and skipping this film."
3,Incomplete,"The movie is what I expected for a recovered lost classic. It is unfortunate that the complete video couldn't be found, but my copy stops playing about 15 minutes from the end, when Ronald Coleman and his brother are leaving Shangri La and I have to stop and start it over and over again to get to the real ending. Very frustrating. It's not my DVD player, it's my copy of the movie. If all copies suffer from this quality control, I wouldn't bother buying it."
5,Wonderful film with a tangled history,"I only wish that one of the deleted scenes included in the ""extras"" on this DVD had made it into the final print. It is a scene between the two female characters who unfortunately don't have an exchange in the released film. It would have made a great film better."
4,Lost Horizons,"Fine old film, well acted for it's time, and well put together, considering the film had a few lost portions that had to be re-constructed. The audio is all there. The missing video portions, which are not lengthy, are covered with the original audio and filled in with stills. A good product for film buffs."
3,lost horizon,I have always wanted a copy of Lost Horizon. I think they did their best to make all the sound and picture come out together but it was somewhat annoying. I am glad I now have my copy.
4,Classic Film to DVD,"Classic 30's black & white film with documentation & narration about finding peace & harmony in Shangri-La.After a plane crash in a horrific snow storm in the Himalayas, the local inhabitants bring the survivors to their habitat for eternity. Everything is fine as long as they play the game & not try to escape. Of course this doesn't happen when they realize a return to the world they left behind & missing their materialistic lifestyle is almost impossible, however some do make a successful attempt. A few stayed on. Those returning home found their actions exposed a paradise that could possibly put an end to Shangri-La. You have to see the rest for yourself.Some scenes were recreated from individual frames where the actual film footage was either lost or destroyed."
4,great tale of love and introspection,"This movie is in my opinion superior to the book it is based on. I found the book a bit boring, while this movie is all but! Many aspects are clearly very incredible, but then again this is a novel, almost a fairy tale, not a travelogue.The main point I came away with is that somewhere there might a Shangri-la near all of us, we must only open our eyes to see it, accept it and be ready for change. The worst favor we can do to ourselves is stick to the beaten path.The restored original version is great even with a few scenes missing and replaced by a slideshow with the original soundtrack."
4,My review of Lost Horizon,"This is a wonderful film.It makes us fantasize about what it would be like to live for eternity.Although it is 75 years old, it is not dated.I did not give the film 5 stars due to the film scenes that could not be restored.Unfortunately, those scenes were replaced with film stills."
5,A gem of a movie.,"It's been decades since I last saw this movie. This DVD, except for the footage that could not be reproduced/digitized, was as if I saw the movie yesterday. This was an excellent purchase."
4,Wonderful restoration of a film classic,"This DVD of ""Lost Horizon"" is worthwhile to own because of its place in film history and the great bonus materials on this DVD. Sony/Columbia are to be complemented for this! As to the film, itself, there are some very magical moments and excellent cinematography that aptly show off Frank Capra's great talents as a Director.Too bad that Hollywood seems at times so evident in Capra's depiction of Shangri La. The buildings look too incredibly artificial, as if the stage for a 1930s musical. Also it is obvious that while Shangri La was to be supposedly in the region of Tibet, the native costumes are Chinese and surroundings look like Art Deco meets European Gothic. The acting though is quite good and storyline interesting. Worthwhile to see!"
1,Worst Adaptation Ever,"This film should have been left to the ravages of age and studio neglect. Why anyone would want to restore this abortion of an adaptation is beyond me. Although the story line is largely intact, many of the characters have been changed. The Chinese girl ... I don't have the book before me so can't remember the name ... is replaced by a Hollywood nymphet with a supposedly nude bathing scene. I defy anyone to suspend disbelief when confronted with this sort of baggage in deepest Tibet or wherever. Another problem is the rather hysterical acting although some of the actors are credible and sympathetic.This book has not fared well in Hollywood ... this adaptation is the worse of any film I have seen ... the later musical [!!] adaptation is the next worst."
5,Excellent,"One of the best 10 movies ever made. Where can I get a copy of the musical made in 1973? I know it was a flop, but would still like it in my collection."
4,Delightful,"This is a movie which should probably be watched every few years to remind us that out there, somewhere, hidden from us is a better world where the only law is ""be kind."""
5,ONE OF THE FIVE BEST FILMS EVER PRODUCED,"Ronald Colman is gives on of his best performences as Conway, to me this films ranks up there with the Prisoner of Zenda (original version) and Gone With the Wind. Something about Shangrila and finding ones place in life is appealing. The story is well written and the film is very well directed. The message of the film may be missed by the kids of today but to me the film is well worth seeing."
5,A rare case where a modern remake would be inappropriate,"Yes, this movie is one of the oldest sound films we have available today, but the magic of its presentation hasn't diminished at all. By being shot in black and white with its crude sound, this film seems to enhance the awe and enchantment of the mystical land of Shangri-La which James Hilton so vividly described in his classic novel. The book and film were made even more popular when Franklin D. Roosevelt named the Maryland presidential retreat ""Shangri-La"" (Eisenhower renamed it ""Camp David""). A modern color remake of this film in musical form made back in the seventies was far less commercially successful than this thirties version. It's a great showcase for the now-deceased veteran actors Ronald Colman, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, Sam Jaffe, et al."
4,Oldie but great !,"Once again a story can trump effects anytime. This version is really untouchable at this time, compared to the later release with the same title. The characters are wonderful. Its hard to imagine how one could reassemble everything to engender another quality film like this. Restoration techniques have saved this film from complete deterioration. A huge thanks is given to those involved in its rescue. I love the idea of a paradise on earth, especially if it is partitioned geographically from the seemingly insurmountable human struggles that are ripping the rest of the planet apart. The truly lasting works of mankind are few but they may just be found at the idyllic utopia known as Shangri La. The J. Hilton novel was destined to find the screen at some point. Please watch and dream of the society displayed here. Don't dismiss this one because of its age or lack of color. The messages are just too important."
2,Misinformation gets in the way of good writing,"While this is a beautifully illustrated and well written book, the liberties the author took with the story of Joe Jackson are a disservice to young readers and listeners. My second-grade son was so anxious to get this book, but found that it didn't really ring true. The bat-maker calls Joe by the nickname ""Shoeless Joe"" before that nickname was used -- and even before the shoeless incident.This really ruined the authenticity of the book for us and led to a discussion about what can be believed in books. ..."
5,Excellent,"That's definitely an excellent book about medieval life. If you like medieval history, buy it."
4,Wonderful reading,"This book is funny, different and moving. Mothertime is a story about an alcoholic ex-beauty who neglects her children. After one disasterous Christmas, the children decide they want an actual, maternal mother - a real mother - so they trap their mother in a sauna where they hold her hostage for months, take away her booze and cigarettes, and make her wear flowery feminine clothes. Throughout the book, the author tricks you into feeling indignant, and satisfied that this horrible mother finally got hers. Then the book's ending takes you completely by surprise (I pride myself on seeing things coming - I didn't see this at all). It stops you short and opens your eyes to some reasons people are they way they are, and reminds you that we don't always have the right to judge."
1,Don't buy this one!,"We're big fans of the Leap Pad, as our daughter plays with it constantly and will sit for hours with it on a long car trip. This particular book, unfortunately, is a real dud. Very little interesting information, pointless games, and nothing to entice little ones to learn anything. It's definitely not sophisticated enough for the suggested 6- 8 year old age group, as our 4 1/2 year old is beyond its limited educational value. A real disappointment."
2,FALSE Advertising,"It lists the selection of eyelashes to choose from, and I chose 19A. Instead I received 19, not what I wanted at all. And when I asked about it, the seller said that they choose what eyelashes they send you. What is this? Why would I want to pay this much for a random pair of eyelashes I don't even want? Unsatisfied with this purchase."
1,Model 21 False Eyelashes No. 7 10 pairs,"I received my order and the lashes are very stiff, they are so stiff I cant apply or use them. Because the lashes are so stiff when you take them off of the paper you cannot shape them in order to apply them, they just stay in the same position that you see, no matter how hard you try to shape them.The lashes are placed on a paper cardboard of some sort and when you take the lashes off of the paper, there is paper on the lashes that you can't remove.I am not happy with this purchase."
3,Worth Reading,"This book is very well written. The characters are developed and the story is solid. Fate of one of the characters is blurred in the final chapter, which is unfortunate.However, those reviewers throwing around five star reviews obviously have not read Ghost Story, Pet Semetary or even Son of the Endless Night.This book is good. It isn't The Shining"
4,Nice,"I felt dumb paying $20 for a case when I spent only $50 on the iPod itself, however it solved my problem. The first time I jogged and sweat while wearing the naked iPod, it froze up. I had to shake the sweat out of it and it started working again. Now I don't have this problem. One minor issue is that is that you lose some tactile feedback on the buttons. Also you can't really access the switch on the back, but I don't use it."
4,Kids loved it,"Got this for Christmas for my daughter. She loves Backyardigans, so it was perfect for her. It is a small toy, but ty dolls are just like that. Only thing I didn't care for was that one of her jumper straps keeps losing its thread and breaking from the rest of the outfit. I can mend it myself, but it's awkward to get to and I shouldn't have to be repairing my kid's toys less than a month after she gets it. She doesn't care about the strap though, so it's no big deal. Otherwise, a good item."
4,Uniqua,"My baby is a backyardigans fan, and Uniqua is one of her favoritesthis buddy is so cute, but I spect that were more similar than the one that appear on tv"
3,Inconsistent flavor - last one bitter,"I bought this about a year ago and it tasted delicious. After reading how great pomegranate is for the skin, even slightly sagging skin, I bought it again.This time it is so bitter that I have to add a ton of my NOW Better Stevia to be able to get it down! I can understand that one crop is less sweet than another; but this is so bitter, it tastes as if they also juiced some of the membrane around the juice seeds.Although I did dilute it more than directed as soon as I realized the bitterness, I found that diluting it a great deal more helped decrease the bitterness.As far as the skin goes; yes, there is enough of a difference that I want to be sure to drink some each day. I just want to find a brand that is more consistent in taste."
4,fantastic taste,"I was very surprise by the wonderful taste of this product. Having been suggested to me by my eating plan program, I thought the tadte would be bitter. I love the taste and use every day as my sweetner in my tea."
