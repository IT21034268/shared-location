4,Wonderful debut album,"Polly Paulusma has a voice that is distinctive, its breathiness is very evocative. Her voice doesn't blow you away at first, but it gradually grows on you. Her lyrics are wonderful and quirky, although sometimes she crams too many words into a line at times. The lyrics aren't just about love lost or anything in that vein and it makes her music refreshing and stand out. The guitar sounds warm and intimate, perhaps since most of the songs were recorded in a garden shed with just Polly and her guitar. A great debut from a promising artist."
4,Rolling Cascading Piano Jazz,"I really like this album. I'm not very familiar with all of the ""new"" piano jazz, or much of the old stuff, but I know what I like! The form used is pretty standard: piano-centric ensemble jazz. But the territory charted is meaty, relevant, and fresh, with hardly a stale jazz cliche in sight. I originally bought this CD years ago through the Wayside catalog, and even though I wouldn't expect to actually see it listed here, I thought it was definitely worth giving a positive review. I still enjoy listening to it, and it's just as fresh today. I also like the idea that cool, interesting jazz can be knocked out by a young, hot looking asian woman."
5,Crucial Audition Advice for the Panicing Actor,"Well I recentley attended a class of Rob's and I have to say his book and style of teaching and breaking down a lesson is quite intruiging. He takes any different ""Method"" of Acting and simplifies it into a simple universal ""how to book the job"" way. He has backround in theatre and directing. He fully understands the craft of acting and as an actor I respect that completely. I don't write a review unless the book I read is either amazing or horrible. This book is ""simply"" amazing and a CRUCIAL tool for ANY actor trying to break into film or television.P.S. Thanks again Rob!!! I hope to be working with you in the future. (I have made some choices ;-) )"
5,A wonderful use of the English language,"I love to read history of any sort but I'm not particularly interested in the American Civil War or the ""border wars"" that accompanied it. Having said this, I could hardly put this book down. Woodrell writes as easily as a canary sings and is as evocative in his language as a Sunday preacher. Some readers may reel from the sheer volume of casual violence in this book but, after all, that is what it was like during this period of time and wishing it didn't happen doesn't make it go away. Remarkably, I didn't find the story line particularly significant and the ending won't make you gulp; it is the individual people, not the events --- not even the gangs --- that take center stage. I found that character development and the use of language set in the tapestry of the times the most engaging aspects of this remarkable book."
5,And so on and so on.,"Great book. Great film.BTW; The book is still available under the title ""Ride With The Devil."""
4,Raw telling of not-so-famous Civil War events,"Living in a community where we celebrate Bushwhacker Days, I have been wanting to read this novel for a long time but have not been able to find it. The movie is excellent; the book is gripping and raw.Daniel Woodrell does not editorialize or put thoughts into the characters' minds. He merely presents events without embellishment; the reader can decide what to think. I believe this is probably one of the best descriptions of the lawlessness and violence that accompanied the Civil War -- violence without cause or belief to justify it.To my grandmother, who was borm just after the Civil War, the worst thing you could call someone was to call them a Bushwhacker. I understand why. Woodrell does an excellent job in painting a pretty ugly picture."
5,What a Watch!,"The Citizen Men's Calibre Eco-Drive watch is a fine piece of jewelry. The beauty of the watch is you never need to replace batteries; it is a truly ""green"" watch that operates on light or solar power. Just some items to nick-pick: 1 of 3 interior dials is not consistent in design, the sweeping second hand in stopwatch mode is difficult to see, and the numeric date window is small and somewhat difficult to read. Otherwise, it is a generally well-designed, well-crafted, elegant sports watch."
3,Released motivated by Japanese attention,"These remixes were available widely among the web, any t.A.T.u. could have heard these months before this was released in Japan and Europe.This cd is just another way to market the girls and try to keep the fans occupied as we wait and wait and wait and wait for the second album.I've listened to all of the clips and they do not seem worthy of the price at all, besides you can find free remixes online or make your own that sound better. Also, a few remixes are available on the cd singles (that cost less to import) and on both versions of the album."
1,good for a few weeks-then it became outdated,"when i first bought this book,i thought to myself,""cool,this will keep me entertained""and it did,for a few weeks,that isa few weeks after this book was published along came little Moses Martin(brother of Apple),Suri Cruise,Shiloh Nouvel jolie pitt,Bluebell Madonna Halliwell and others i cannot remember. these high profile births made this book out of date just weeks after publication.a new edition is already needed.this is the type of book which would need updating once a year at the least to keep it up to date.if you want to name youre child after the latest celebrity babies,then this book isnt for you.stick to celeb magazines(or pray for a new edition of this book).if however,youll happily name your baby after an ""old"" celeb baby name or just want a laugh,then this book may just be right for you."
3,Terriffic Photos,"If I wanted to buy a book with the greatest pictures and varities of American Eskimos- this would be that book. Unfortunately, I wanted a book with more writing than pics.I needed to know about the care, feeding and nurturing of my new pet, and this book did not supply that. However, I will keep the book for the pictures to show people the varities of this breed."
3,In response to: A reader from Alaskan Native,"The American Eskimo dog is a very different breed than tha Alaskan Malamut. I happen to own one of the former, and they are significantly smaller. The larger sizes of the Eskie (American Eskimo Dog) would barely reach a full size Malamut's knee, and their tail curls up on their backs. This book, while it covers one of my favorite subjects, doesn't cover much information that is helpful for a family pet rather than a show dog."
1,Flimsy,"I was looking for an all plastic seat because the wood core ones tend to delaminate after a while. Well, these are all plastic, but they are made a of a plastic that isn't very stiff. So they flex when you sit on the seat. Also, unlike the wood core seats which you can sit on the closed seat, you can do that with these because the lid collapses and you feel like you are going to go thru the seat."
3,Not much to say.,"We've managed to avoid subjecting this product to severe testing conditions. It appears to function as expected. That is, it has not attempted to shatter, disconnect from the porcelain, or been inbued with poltergeist-like abilities to open and shut itself. I fortunately have nothing dramatic at all to say about this: it's a simple utilitarian item that is simple and utilitarian."
5,Comprehensive analysis by highly respected scholar,"The work of Julius Stone, one of the most prolific jurists of last century, is always authoritative and of excellent quality. This analysis of the legal issues surrounding the Arab-Israeli conflict proves to be no exception, and for the most part it remains highly relevant to the situation today.'Israel and Palestine: Assault on the Law of Nations' takes the deceptive mythology that is still current in its stride, convincingly debunking the Palestinian Arab claim to the land between the Mediterranean and the River Jordan and exposing the coerced partisanship of the United Nations in respect of the West in general and Israel in particular.Highly readable, comprehensive and superbly written. If you only buy one book on Middle East politics, buy this."
3,Is this the directors cut?,"I will delete my review and update it as soon as I can find out and buy it, looking for the directors cut, with no ads just nature scenes. thanks"
3,"Buy the other one, Best of 60's","You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby you're no good. The fact that this song (popularized by Linda Rondstadt) is NOT on this CD disqualifies it. Buy the other collection (ASIN: B00004T88C), which has the same number of tracks, another 5 dollars, but you get You're No Good, which is cool as it gets."
4,serbian and yugoslav mauser rifles,"A little dis-appointed . Thought there would be more historical, specific info on particular models. Overall, I am ok with it. Thanks."
5,Excellent Reference,"Very informative reference, an absolute must for collectors of these Mauser variants! Incredible photos, very well organized, plus an interesting history of the geo-political region."
2,Not Really An Apt Title,"I remember managing to find a drive-in that was showing the first run ECEG; and I remember my girlfriend not saying a word while we watched. She was too kind. In retrospect, it was so totally wrong for the time that one almost has to respect it. I say almost. It was a numbing experience then and the most one can say for it now is: At least the Elvis impersonators will leave it alone. The story is weak, the co-stars are painful, and the soundtrack so bad, the weakest selling record of Elvis' career managed to kill of the Extended Playing record. But , for all that, it is Elvis, and the true beliver will find something in it worth carrying away. Its just best watched alone."
1,One of his worst films,"If Easy Come, Easy Go is not the worst film Elvis ever did, it is one of his worst. Not that his performance is bad, but the script and storyline are. It was obvious that Colonel Tom was cutting back on the what he was paying script writers inorder to try to make a quick buck. Even the songs in this one are not very good. Movies like this one are what killed Elvis' movie career and reputation as an actor. His management should have been fired for getting him into this one!Pass on this and get one of his early movies (Jaihouse Rock or King Creole are good) or maybe Blue Hawaii or GI Blues (they are far better than this one)."
2,Elvis Presley Meets Elsa Lanchester!,"""Easy Come, Easy Go"" (1967) was Elvis Presley's final movie for producer Hal Wallis, who didn't win any awards for this routine effort. Presley trimmed down for this film and he looks great. Despite the usual Wallis formula, Elvis gives a surprisingly adept performance and sings a few catchy tunes. However, the ""Yoga Is as Yoga Does"" number with Elvis and Elsa Lanchester must be seen to be truly believed. A far cry from the days of ""Loving You"" and ""King Creole."""
5,easy come,It was nice to complete my collections of Elvis 'movies. I don't care if its not one of his better. He still is the best.
2,Easy Come Easy Go should be for boats fans.,"If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher. If you are an Elvis Presley fan, then buy or rent Jailhouse Rock on video or dvd."
4,Old resource for prayer and worship,I have used this book (other copies) for as long as I have been a pastor. I needed other copies for work and to give to a church member interested in prayer books.
3,i didn't notice any inflammation relief,"i was hoping for some pain or inflammation relief. i finished the whole bottle, but didn't notice any lessening of pain. i think maybe i'm just too far gone for some herbals."
3,"It's fine, but not as great as I had hoped","My son was really disappointed when this arrived and it didn't come with the same sheet of stickers that are shown in the pictures and on the box. It did not come with any ABC stickers (only some character stickers and very few at that) I had high hopes for this because we are trying to get him to use the big toilet and he is obsessed with the ABCs. I thought being able to decorate it with letters would be fun. No such luck. I'm actually pretty annoyed about that.Anyway, aside from that, it is very thin, appears to fit on most toilets and fits in my diaper bag which is what I was hoping for.This product also took an insane amount of time to receive. I'm a prime member and used to getting things very quickly, so when it took a month or more to receive it, I was really surprised."
1,Hand Impact Driver,Product was mis-shipped and little help to correct issue from supplier was received. Only impact base unit was received in a cardboard box and no red plastic box or screw driver attachments included as was advertised in product photo. Supplier was made aware but did nothing to correct so I am very unhappy with this supplier and will never buy something from them again. A Life lesson was learned about this supplier in this case.
1,not as pictured,"product is not as pictured. You only get the impact part of the driver. Useless unlett you have the other parts. I was looking for a full set, as pictured."
3,"some good work, not his best","I bought this book at full price in a chain bookstore because I think Lux should get all the recognition coming to him. His selected poetry is masterful, The Street of Clocks astounding, and there are some damn fine poems in here, but in all I don't think this work snaps-to like they did in other collections. Boatloads of mummies, and even a self-chastisement about his neurotic history probing, but in all he doesn't quite pull off what he did in poems like The Man Into Whose Yard and others. Lux is quite a worker, though, and I will snatch up his next collection with unrelenting ardor."
1,"Dark, sad, squirrely","This poet must be drowning in his own sorrows and hoping to take the whole world with him. From the tone of the work, he's on a spin to the bottom never to return to normalcy. In truth, it scares me to think there are men out there like this who want to fool you into thinking they don't live with insecurity by showing how tough they are. Instead, they are transparent. It is the one virtue of this work. It reveals a weak character."
1,Don't like,"The tip was way too small and when I tried to useIt, it seemed all dried up. It didn't even show up on my eye.I tried to go over my eye again but you couldntEven see anything. I never could use it. Waste of money"
5,Nothing beats a good night's sleep!,"This stuff is absolutely wonderful! I wish I'd known about it years ago. It doesn't ""knock you out"", but it has a sedative effect that really helps you relax and fall into a deep sleep. It also helps tame my ""Jimmy legs"" (restless leg syndrome). I put one dropperful into a glass of water before bed. I highly recommend this to anyone with restless leg syndrome, anxiety or insomnia. It's a permanent fixture in my bathroom now! I noticed that it's an additive in many European sleeping medications."
5,Great relaxation and sleep aid,"My husband has great difficulty unwinding and shutting off his mind at the end of the day. I give him this (still waiting on my other herbs I've ordered) either alone or with a tea. It seems to help either way to relax him and give him restful sleep. I've also taken it and compared nights I take it with nights I don't. I don't know if it is an effect of the herb, but I have very vivid dreams and I also remember my dreams on the nights when I take the Passion Flower tincture. I don't know if there is any science behind that, but it is just my own personal experience. Another interesting note is that even though my dreams often contain elements of danger, I am not alarmed, frightened, or stressed in any way when I awaken."
3,It's okay,I take one dropper full about 30 minutes before bedtime and I do notice I get a tad bit more drowsy than usual. I do seem to fall asleep a little sooner but I am still unable to get more than 3 or 4 hours without waking up.I am waiting to receive another product I ordered from here: Sleep Blend from Solray. It had some good reviews and I will keep you posted.
2,Sixty-Six % Missing Information,"Overall, I would have to rate the book average. There are twelve houses to be concerned with and in this book the author adresses only the four ""primary"" Asc. IC, Dsc, MH. This appears rather limiting since we are all effected by all the houses, the planets and their aspects. I believe that the author could have expanded with more related detail pertaining to aspects and the houses."
1,Problems with Vinyl Twice,First one had a split at the seam of the vinyl. The second one looked like it had a slice in the vinyl. Returned item.
3,WARNING! FOR WOMEN ONLY!!,"This toilet seat is nice and comfy to sit on, and seems fairly sturdy. The bolts don't want to stay tightened up though. It should come with a warning ""For Women Only"". The seat will absolutely NOT stay raised up without holding it with one hand. When my grandsons come to visit------that is a real problem."
2,Torn Vinyl,"The padded toilet seat seemed fine at first, but the thin vinyl tore within a few months. The replacement I chose is not padded."
2,Wow....designer??? NOT!,"I already own a Mayfair 13CP Designer and what I received was NOT the ""Designer"" Series in anyway. The package has a sticker that says 13CP on it, but anyone can put it on even if it isn't one, I guess.The package says SOFT Series, not Designer Series, as advertised. The seat is not as heavy as the Designer series ones that I've purchased at Boscovs and the padding is only half of the REAL Designer series seat. I'm very disappointed that they sold me a ""Designer series"" seat that was really a ""Soft series"" seat. The word ""Designer"" doesn't appear anywhere on the package.It's not as sturdy not as padded and I'm not very happy !!!Doesn't that amount to false advertising? Beware Buyers!!If you're looking for a Mayfair 13CP DESIGNER series toilet seat...do not purchase this one, because it's not."
3,Great Toilet seat.. if you don't have a kohler toilet!,Great if you don't have a Kohler Toilet.... the bolts don't fit in the toilet seat holes.. But it works for our American Standard toilet.
1,Keep looking,Purchased this item a little over 1 year ago. Avg weight users at less than 200 lbs. It began to tear after 8 months and then the PLASTIC hinge broke last week. No refund.
5,Awesome.,"Looked all over for seat with metal screws. I hate plastic screws. This is just what I needed after searching half way around the world. My last seat was over 20 years old and was starting to crack. Imagine that! Love the new one and hope it holds up as well as the last. Seems to be made of good quality, especially for what is being sold these days. I would buy this product again. Impressed with the quality."
4,Elivis Movies available,"The person that does not have ""It happened at the Worlds Fiar"", I have seen that available at a Best Buy store in the past few months. I have had a copy for quite some time in VHS. I also am looking for a new copy of ""Girls, Girls, Girls"". It should come out in production soon I would think. All other titles seem to available from time to time."
5,their asking too much for the tape,Hi i think your asking to much for the tape your not suppose to make money on elvis i think 20.00 is enough dont you the tape im talking about is GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS its good but not great i like to have it for my grandson thank you for listening to me bye Larry
1,Elvis Fans Take Irrationality To New Highs,"To the reviewer from Norfolk, United Kingdom----the fact that Presley himself stated in an interview that his music and films were juvenile--- yet you still deify him--- tells a lot about your level of rationality. Even after the man behind the curtain is exposed you still choose to believe he is the Wizard of Oz. I think the proper term for such behavior is ""delusional."" I agree with the reviwers from Memphis and Drexel Hill----even Presley himself knew he was a marketing phenomenon and little else."
1,I Agree--Presley Was An Overblown Country Bumpkin,"Elvis a great singer? Remastered or not, C, F, and G chord songs are still simple-minded---as was Elvis whose IQ was indeed less than 80. Now maybe that doesn't matter to many of his Hicksville fans, but nobody with that low an IQ could possibly even understand good musicianship, tonality, or announciation. Like it or not, Presley's popularity was diamterically opposed to his level of talent. By the way, after the hickabililies are finished listening to ""Teddy Bear"" and ""Hound Dog,"" they should try listening to Ella Fitgerald, Bobby Darin, Louis Armstrong, or Mel Torme do Cole Porter, Richard Rogers, Johnny Mercer, etc. Now that's singing that takes talent, native intelligence, and taste."
3,"Lighten up, you uptight critics!","SHEEEESH!! Some of the vicious attack 'reviews' here are ridiculous. No, most Elvis films are not profound cinema, but to attack the man and his fans as hillbillies and fools (in long rambling diatribes) seems odd and extreme..."
4,I'm In Agreement!,"This certainly isn't one of Elvis' good movies -- but it holds a sentimental favorite place in my heart. It was one of the first Elvis movies I ever saw when I first became a fan, way way back in 1975. It's one of the few I don't own, and I have been eagerly searching for Elvis movie titles on DVD -- and have been very disappointed to find so few! This year, with the 25th Anniversary, would be a grand time to have finally reissued all the movie titles on DVD!"
4,Loved the movie,I have just about every Elvis movie and I have been tring for a long time to get this palicular one. I remember watching it when I was younger and now that I am older it would be a great movie to put in my collection.
5,ELVIS PROMOTES MULTI-CUTURALISM,"I like the way Elvis presents Mamma and Poppa Stavros and his Chinese friends as part of the American mosaic. But honestly, for some reason, I always thought this film was in Florida, not Hawaii as everyone else says. Maybe it was because I thought Mamma and Papa were Greek, like the Greeks in 'Beneath the Twelve Mile Reef' which was in Tarpon Springs,but the song 'We'll Be Together' that he sings at their party has a Spanish verse. I also like 'Earth Boy' which he sings with the Chinese children. As for the romantic ballads, I especially liked 'Where Do You Come From' but although it's part of the album, it isn't in the film."
3,Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!,"Elvis Presley energizes the screen in this formulaic musical-comedy from producer Hal Wallis. ""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" (1962) does not rank among the King's finest efforts, yet his engaging performance goes a long way toward redeeming a humdrum script. The uneven soundtrack includes two memorable songs from Otis Blackwell and Winfield Scott: the smash hit ""Return to Sender"" and the underrated ""We're Comin' in Loaded."" Amazingly enough, ""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Musical (but lost to ""The Music Man"")."
5,Girls Girls Girls,Another typical Elvis Presley movie. It won't win an Academy award but it's always entertaining & I love his singing. Filmed in Hawaii & I love the beautiful scenery. Just a big Elvis fan.
4,GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!,I PERSONALLY ENJOYED AND LOVED THE SONGS ESPECIALLY THE TITLE AND END TITLE SONGS. THIS WAS THE FIRST MOVIE I SAW FROM ELVIS AND BECAME A FAN FROM THEN ON. THE PLOT WAS GOOD AND I ENJOY MYSELF EVERY TIME I WATCH IT.
2,Not enough music,"While this video starts with an amazing performance at a stone quarry in Saugerties, New York; there's just way too little music. In a video I don't need to hear critics drone on and on about what makes Sonny great. That ought to be self-evident from the musical content. There are also interviews with Sonny and his wife that could have been condensed and offered as a ""special feature."" The japanese orchestral performance was interesting but, really, I'd like to see the rest of the Saugerties concert. Overall, there's maybe thirty minutes of worthwhile footage."
4,pleased again,"nice item good condtion, not like vol. #7 with a broken case. Yes I am very unhappy with that purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Ho-hum Compilation From The Netherlands With A Couple Of Gems,"There are better Rick(y) Nelson compilations on the market than this Disky effort from Europe, which contains no liner notes and presents the same photo of Nelson front, back and inside.But it does contain tracks which are not easily found anywhere else [#s 3, 4, and 5 recorded in 1958/59] and the sound quality is excellent. Also, as a completist collector of hit singles I grabbed it for one song in particular, Teenage Idol, which isn't included on some of the North American compilations.Not a bad buy if you happen to be looking for some of the selections included."
1,Dont waste your money!,"I watched and enjoyed Lawnmower Man, which was a decent movie, but the ending was kind of open ended. I purchased this one thinking it was a sequel. What a dissapointment! Very bad movie, not a sequel."
1,Their 1st mistake was changing the ending of part 1,"Did they think that everyone would just forget how the first lawnmower man ended? Why does Jobe need a goshdarned chip to be able to do what he wants?! How is he human again? Why is this called Lawnmower Man 2!? It may as well have been a standalone film. I'd like to throw this dvd in the trash, but my trashcan does not deserve such cruel treatment.......""Jack in,""....are they serious!? Flying motorcylces---with guns!? C'mon, you've had like 15 years of a good laugh, now give us the REAL sequel already!"
1,It really s***s,"The beggining is really fuzzy. As in, confusing. The storydoesn't make sense. Things aren't explained and the guy, Peter lookslike he's 17, even though this is supposed to be like, 50 years into the future."
1,Harvey Goldsmith: Have Brain Cell Will Promote Again,"Yes I have heard the news! That great connoisseur of fine art is at it again. Somebody hit me over the head with a salmon please! ""Lawnmower Man 3: Vacant Headroom's Cyberspace For Sale""And why languish at the bottom 100 alone? Just pick up ""Ishtar"" which should sit just one notch above featuring Matt Frewer warming up as: 1) find a turkey. 2) cure the ham. Great!!"
2,Access Denied!!!,"Sometime after the explosion in the original, Jobe is saved and forced to help Government-type people with Virtual Reality. Peter asks Dr. Benjamin Trace to help him with a Chiron Chip before Jobe uses it for evil. If they had used Jeff Fahey from the original, it might have been better, but if you really want to watch it, you might like THE LAWNMOWER MAN 2!!!"
3,An average movie,"While confusing at some points this film has spectacular special effects. However the movie is bogged down by a horrible attempt at a plot, and for the most part a terrible cast, the only saving grace in the cast department is Matt Frewer (Jobe). He makes you actually enjoy a large chunk of the film. You should try it out and I personally think that you should rent first before you decide to buy."
1,Somebody SHOOT ME!!,"Oh my God. I was SO dissappointed with this movie.Where do I start.First off, the acting was horrible. The only actor in this movie that was in part 1 was Peter (Jobes little friend). The first movie had a mysterious and low budget feel to it, which I love, and part 2 has a fluffy and hollywood feel to it, which I absolutely loath. Also, The connection between part 1 and part 2 was very weak. What's up with the telephone rings? That was a great idea, why didn't they keep that?!...Trust me, if your thinking about buying this movie, dont!! But if for some reason you do, all the negative reviews here at Amazon will make perfect sense!!! This movie is BAD!!!"
1,A possible alternative to physical torture...,"There are two kind of bad films. There are films which are bad in a way that makes them enjoyable and often amusing, such as ""Plan nine from outer space"", and there are films that simply encourage your lunch to visit the nearest piece of furniture. This is one of those films. It actually incourages the trade in pirate videos- Because anything is better than having to go to the cinema to spend HONEST money on this junk. In fact, why not buy it, play the first five minuites (That are filmed in Girrafe-O-Vision) and then use it to beat an irritating nieghbor to death? Trust me, you'll feel like it. Not that I'm passing judgement or anything, mind."
1,Worst sequel ever made,"This ""film"" is deserving of every derisive adjective I can think of. The makers of this film either didn't watch the original Lawnmower Man, or thought that it would be too much trouble to worry about things like continuity or for that matter acting. Were I Brosnan or Fahey, I would be rather insulted by this poor showing."
2,I'm so depressed!,"Oh my God. I was so dissappointed with this movie.Where do I start.First off, the acting was horrible. The only actor in this movie that was in part 1 was Peter (Jobes little friend). The first movie had a mysterious and low budget feel to it, which I love, and part 2 has a fluffy and hollywood feel to it, which I absolutely loath. Also, The connection between part 1 and part 2 was very weak.But, I did like the story line in part 2; it was well written.I tell you, I was sitting watching the movie with this look on my face, like someone in the room just farted amd the smell wasn't going away."
2,Seriously Stupid,DID NOT like this movie at all. The entire thing was stupid! I would not recommend wasting your time on it at all!
2,Not very good.,"Doesn't sound like real steel drums. I think that they used a synthesizer on an organ with steel drum sounds on it. If you want a good steel drum album get ""Calypso Favourites"" by The Caribbean Allstars or ""Steel Band Music of the Caribbean"" by The Steel Drums of Trinidad."
2,Not the best selection...,"Not the best select if you are looking for true caribbean steel drum music. Sounds like an organ making steel drum music. CD Steel Drum Favorites is better, real drums, costs less, only down side it has 9 songs on it,."
4,PETO,Peto is a very intersting album his music has a wide range a varieties and thats why it is so good.But some of the music is average and thats why i give it four stars.Its good music but excellent varity and taht put together is a must to buy Vic
1,Should not have the same title as the original movie,"When I heard that Timecop had a sequel coming out, I couldn't wait to see it. Then I found out it wasn't John Claude Vanne Damme reprising his role in it.Why bother making a sequel with no returning cast members? Especially the star. Vanne Damme is replaced by Jason Scott Lee (Jungle book) as the hero who travels through time to purposely change things around here and there. I saw a review that this was a movie for sci-fi geeks to enjoy. I didn't see much on the sci-fi side, apart from time travel, but it makes me wonder why they didn't just name it something else and make a separate movie instead of calling it a second installment to a great movie.This has nothing to do with the first movie, and breaks the rules made in the first one. If ti was called something else and not supposed to be a sequel to Time Cop 1, it might have been a passable movie, but trying to claim this is a second installment, pffft"
4,Timecop 2,"Cool movie, but confusing..... lots of time jumping in this one..... I hope they made some more Timecop movies...."
1,EVEN THOMAS IAN GRIFFITH CAN'T SAVE THIS DISASTER,"When I read that Timecop 2 was about Thomas Ian Griffith going back in time to kill Hitler I thought it was going to be the greatest straight-to-video movie ever. Sadly, this brilliant idea is downplayed and utterly wasted in this pointless and nonsensical sequel which features more paradoxes and plot holes than you can shake a stick at. None of this movie makes any sense if you care to spend more than one second considering the implications of many scenes. If you like ...movies that feature music video style direction and power chord guitar soundtracks during the fight sequences then by all means buy this film. Otherwise stay far, far away from this boring and low-budget waste of time."
2,Pretty Sad!,"Bad, Bad, Bad!!I have no clue why and how these movies get made. The second installment spared us the agony of seeing Van Damme but came with its own poison. The movie tries to be extremely smart about how timelines can be contaminated by time travelers changing things in the past. However, there are more holes than Swiss cheese in this movie. All I can say is 'Stay Away!'."
3,Bashful's DVD Summary #028,"Best:1) It gives you a lot more to think about on the subject of timelines and paradoxes (if only to correct the film's apparent mistakes).2) It has a ""Stargate: SG1"" sensibility, with the central (time) control center concept.3) The special effects (and lighting) teams whipped up some cool visuals.4) There's a couple of behind-the-scenes documentaries.Worst:1) Martial arts and time travel is an unusual blend that doesn't always work. Fight scenes were inserted at times for no good reason.2) The movie is very hard to understand if you follow every detail (but it can be fun to try).3) The actor's didn't always seem to be trying hard to be convincing in their roles.Recommendation:As a time travel movie, this one is above average. As a sci-fi and/or action movie, it's just average. There are enough new twists on old ideas to make it interesting for casual viewing. Get this one cheaper than retail whenever possible."
1,Total Schlock,"This movie is great for unintentional comedy but nothing more. The first and second movie have no connections whatsoever. A disgrace that this got green lighted. But then again, thats why I ordered it!"
3,"One Red, one pink and one white rose.","I thoroughly enjoyed For The Roses- and went straight to the library to find these 3 smaller books. Their length did not bother me. But they seemed a little shallow. I did enjoy the story for One White Rose the best out of the 3. The others were silly and unrealistic, especially One Red Rose. The story for Adam- a black African American but the 1800's was too unrealistic for me to enjoy. I do think the idea of the 3 smaller books was a great idea, though!"
2,Julie Garwood still one of my fav authors but not this series,"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsIf this is your first time considering a Julie Garwood book, pass here and select any one of her other historicals. Generally they are all 5 star reviews in my book.I have to admit, I was disappointed in Adam's story. Maybe disappointed is to strong of a word. Genevieve drove me nuts and I really couldn't stand her and her nonsense. She seemed very smart and brave one moment and then just plain stupid the next. There is nothing I hate more than a stupid heroine who makes stupid decisions.The storyline in One Red Rose didn't draw me in at all and in fact, I've made the decision to not read the next book in the series for awhile. The Rose books just haven't grabbed me the way Julie Garwood books usually memorize me. I am not sure why I haven't fallen in love with this series as the Clayborne men are outstanding. I just didn't feel this series."
3,One Red Rose,"Here's what I think.This story had so much potential, the characters had apparent history with each other, and there was so much that wasn't explained. I think this story was too strong to be the short length it was. It should have been a longer book, then it would have been easier to get into and feel more connected to the characters."
5,"Nice watch, but no replacement bands available.","I love this watch, but the band breaks easily and I haven't found where I can buy a replacement band. Luckily it's a good price, so I've been able to buy a new one when the band breaks."
2,Armitron Women's Watch,I had to return this watch because the band was too small and tight for me to wear comfortably. Actually the entire watch was smaller than I had pictured it so was disappointed.
5,Is this Review a Manifestation of Ultimate Truth or a Figment of Your Imagination?,"What a fascinating journey through a bizarre and brilliant mind! I had always wantedto learn more about Philip K. Dick, but had been turned off by other articles andbooks that had drained the life from Dick's story with overly dry and pedantic prose.In contrast, Carrere offers psychological insight and philosophical speculationthat can only be described as ""Phildickian."" As one who had read all ofDick's better-known works, Carrere seems to have reanimated Dick's spirit in thiscompelling, partially novelized tale. What the reader sacrifices in footnotes andverifiable fact is more than made up for by the sheer human interest of the story."
3,Biography or speculation?,"This is a fairly interesting book on Dick. It does explore the connections between his life and work, which illuminates some of the otherwise confounding conclusions to some of his novels. I think the author goes into too much detail in summarizing some of Dick's work, though, so that if you had't read Time Out of Joint, for example, or the Alphane Clans, the author pretty much spoils the ending of those books for you. The summaries could have been replaced with more details of Dick's actual life, which is kind of scanty.My biggest complaint, though, is that the book contains absolutely no documentation whatsoever. No endnotes, nothing. Where does Carrere get his information? There's no way of knowing! I couldn't tell what was documented fact and what was the author's speculation.I could have passed on this book. This is not the definitive biography of Philip K. Dick."
2,"Much Flash, Little Substance","My first problem with this ""biography"" is that the author spends time relating the plots of some of Dick's novels, including their endings. This is annoying, as I have not read all of Dick's works. Therefore, I had to skip the parts where the synopses were inserted. Secondly, the author states that he read too many books to mention. That's funny, as most biographers have no problem citing their sources. We could at least have had a bibliography here. Third, the author injects a LOT of speculation about Dick's state of mind, which is interesting but not in any way reliable as biographical material. I did, though, enjoy the philosophical explanations of some of Dick's theories, especially the discussion of The Man in the High Castle, Dick's masterwork. Read this one with a grain of salt."
4,"""Based on a true story""","As the first page warns, ""this is a very peculiar book."" It is not a traditional biography by any means. In fact, I'm not sure I'd call it a ""biography"" at all. Those looking for an accurate biography of Dick's life should look elsewhere. It's more like those made-for-TV movies that are ""based on a true story."" But it's really something like a ""Phildickian"" novel based on the life of Philip K. Dick that constantly weaves the life and the novels together (a bit of ""postmodern"" intertextuality for those saddened by the derision of Derrida in the blurb on the Amazon page). I found this to be a really intriguing and engrossing literary experience, but some might find it frustrating. While I *probably* learned something about the life of Philip K. Dick, the lack of footnotes, bibliography, or any other ingredients of a traditional biography make it hard to tell. Of course, this difficulty in knowing reality from illusion is perhaps the most Phildickian aspect of the book!"
2,"Okay, a serious review....","First, want to thank those on this review who have provided a few chuckles for me this morning. Well, I actually own two of these seats as they were put into our house by the contractor when it was built in 2004. Don't buy them. I already need to replace them as they will not clean well. They look okay (admittedly toilet seat decor doesn't matter much to me), but after less than three years of light use and weekly cleanings, they have look, well, crappy. Sorry, couldn't resist that."
1,I didn't know toilet seats could be this bad,"For some reason there are mostly joke reviews for this particular toilet seat, but this is a real review. Like the other real review for this seat, ours was installed by the contractor who redid our bathroom two years ago. While the seat itself operates fine and is sturdy enough, the problem is this: the paint on this thing started blistering and peeling within a year. On every surface, all over. It's horrendous. I have used a variety of toilets in my time, and I've never seen a toilet seat disintegrate like this one has. Don't buy this one unless you really love replacing toilet seats and are just looking for a reason to replace them more often."
1,I Was Going To Spend $747 For This Until...,"...I read the California Prop 65 warning in the product description:""This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.""I think my rear will steer clear, ya hear?"
2,So-So,"I bought this toilet seat while it was still available for $747. After a few weeks of intense usage, I found some problems. I found my legs fell asleep after only one hour of continuous use. This made it very difficult to get up without assistance. Also, I found if you start to sweat too much, which most of us do, you end up sticking to the seat when you get up and then the seat slams down making a bunch a racket and leaves a red mark. And finally, the comfort level of this seat is questionable. If you are the slightest bit boney in that area, there is potential for bruises after an active session. Overall, not too bad though."
5,A Great Little Book!,"This is a great little introduction to heraldry, with a Canadian focus. Heraldists in other parts of the world will also find it a fun addition to their library- it is a very rare heraldry book which contains cartoons.The only problem with the book is that it is just an introduction. The author could probably put in enough information (and humour) to write a book about ten times as long."
4,"Great ""Coffee Table"" book excellent thumbnail sketch of area",This is a large hard cover coffee table book that covers many popular areas and locations of the Saginaw County area. The photos taken by Gary Bubliitz are from a new and fresh perspective making this book distinguishable from previous books about Saginaw of the same scale. The commentary from Greg Branch (a lifetme Saginaw resident) are both interesting and accurate and only add to the enjoyment of the book. The only drawback is that the scope of the book is limited to the businesses that funded the book which has left out many of the smaller companies that have made Saginaw the comunity which it is. Overall this book is still a must have for any Saginaw County resident or lover of Saginaw County past or present.
4,The Ventures Best,"This is a great albumn, full of priceless instrumentals, including the best of them all, Walk, Don't Run. Some other good songs include Secret Agent Man, which is heard in the first austin powers movie, Hawaii Five-O, and The 2000 Pownd Bumble Bee. Pedal Pusher is also a must, although i thought that ""Walk Don't Run '64"" was pathetic. A MUST for early 60's fans."
2,Not right,"Probably would gave worked well if correct bolts, other pieces were correct size and correct number. I have to go to the hardware store to buy extra parts. A waste."
1,doesnot fit,"Beware that it does not fit all 16"" bikes .It didn't for my sons bike.I had to return it."
4,Wald Training wheels,These training wheels were very easy to install on my daughters used bicycle. The are solid steel and work well on her Huffy made bike.
5,Riding Strong,"Bought this for my youngest son for his ""Motorcycle"" bike. We live on ten acres in North Florida, lots of sand and ample rust on anything metal. These have held up to some serious abuse by the kids and are still going strong even with all the sand. I would definitely pay every penny for these again without hesitation."
4,training wheels,i have ordered these training wheels and really like the consrtuction and the ease of installation. it would be a nice addition to this product if they had paint color options for the metal part of the wheels
5,An excellent book!,"This is a great book, and I loved it! I found myself thinking about it afterwards, and even had a dream involving it. I can't wait to see if there will be more!"
2,Hinges are poor - material is flaking off,I got 4 of these 1 year ago and the Hinges are not holding up. The fake chrome on them starting to peel off. I am happy with quality of the lids but the I got these for the nice looking hinges and now they are really looking poor. I had my previous ones for 10 years with not issue - replaced them finally with these and one year later - I may have to replace these again. Not too impressed!!
3,DISSAPOINTED,I am very dissapointed in this company for not inspecting their products.Whatever happen to QA and being sure it's right before the customer receives it.What a hassel to have to pack it up and send it back.
1,loud piece of flimsy garbage,"The plug where the USB cable hooked into the back of the fan unit could not have constructed more poorly. The fans get imbalanced and start making awful noises. This item is worth approximately 3 dollars in my opinion. Buy something else unless you plan on using this product in a clean-room and never, ever moving it."
1,"Stay away, if you can","I bought this product twice. The first time, it would make loud clicking noises in the fan. I returned it and got another. Now sometimes the fans don't turn, the wire hooking up the cooler to the laptop needs to be tugged to actually work and the clicking noise is still there. Not to mention the entire cooler feels so fragile, that it can crack with ease. Stay away from this product if you can."
1,Won't stay on,This is the worst product I've ordered in a long time. The chill pad connects with a plug-in cable on the back and to the computer with usb port. The plug-in that goes to the back will not stay in place. It's like they sent the wrong cord the fit is so bad. It wiggles all over the place no matter what you do. Find another brand as this one is really bad.
1,"Fragile, loud, and still doesn't do the job well",Don't bother buying this product. I had it for less than a week before blades started breaking off the fans and it began making horribly loud noises. It doesn't even cool well. I find that to properly cool my laptop I have to balance it somehow so there is a large space underneath the fans.
3,Too Noisy,"The cooling mat is great for getting my laptop off my desk. I have had fan errors woth my laptop, but the cooling mat helps to get air circulating under my laptop so the fan errors that I have don't tend to be as bad as they were. I find that when I use the cooling mat, the mat gets noisy after awhile and then I have to turn it off. It does help to keep my laptop cool which is the reason I bought it in the first place. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to keep their laptop cool."
2,Short life span,I purchased this targus chill mat but after 9 months the fans began to make noise starting up. The noise stopped once the fans were moving after about 2 minutes but now the plug for the USB power has cracked and is pushed inward therefore the product can not be powered anymore. I would not recommend purchasing this item.
2,"Really, really not worth it","This thing was just plain crappy. It was loud, the power plug didn't sit right, and the fact it just had a pair of lame box fans with no ducting meant that if you use this thing on anything but a desk or table, it;s going to suck up hairs, or your blanket will poke the blades, or one of a number of other bad, noisy things will happen.I had it for a couple weeks before it died a loud, annoying death.Spend the extra couple bucks and get thisAntec USB-Powered Notebook Coolerit's fantastic, whisper-quiet, amazingly powerful, and has a sealed bottom with intakes in the back and side, so I can use my laptop on my lap"
1,piece of junk RUN,"The most poorly made thing I have seen in my life. The on off switch worked one time, once! The fans hardly move any air and still they were noisy, making tick tick tick sounds. If this is the best thing you can find go capture a couple of flies, tie em to a string and tape em to the back of your laptop. It will work as well as this does and instead of having to punch the thing when the fan noise has driven you crazy, just untape the flies and replace them with new living flies. In the alternative you could always just wave your hand near the side of your laptop every couple of minutes and certainly work as well as this thing doe.Save your money, buy something like an Antec!!"
1,garbage product waste of $30,I've had this for a few months. It didn't really cool the laptop as much as I'd hoped it would. Not only that but the power hole just started to malfunction. I had to tilt the power plug at certain angle just to keep it working! NEVER will I buy Targus product EVER again unless it is free. Waste of $30 + TAX
1,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","I started having problems within a week of purchasing this item. The fans would just randomly stop working. I would have to tap on it and set it a certain way on the table for them to start working then, in the middle of a game/work/email etc I would shut down due to overheating because the fans stopped working. I realized if I maneuvered the cord a certain way the fans would come back on so this is how I used it for about a month and it not only stopped working 70% of the time but after about 2 months I could no longer plug it in, the little metal thing that you plug the cord into was gone...if I shook it I could hear it rattling around inside. I did not save the packaging and do not have my receipt but I know I paid over $30.00 for this piece of crap. Please, I am begging you, donate the money to charity before you throw it away on this product!!! I couldn't choose less than 1 star."
2,"Mediocre at best, dangerous at worst","I wish this thing was built better, because when it works it keeps the laptop cool. But I've gone through two now and wouldn't buy another. The USB connector that goes to the laptop is kinda flimsy, and mine pushed all the way through - inevitable since the plug is always sticking out the back of the unit.Most concerningly is that the fan blades are curved and spin towards the curve. This means that if something sticks into the fan, they can catch on the case and completely jam the fan (bending the blade). Or worse: they can snap off and send a dangerous shard of plastic across the room or straight into your crotch. Thankfully, I've only seen the ""across the room"" option, but I've seen it eject across the room twice. Once those fan blades get a little bent (can happen if a piece of paper or something else gets caught in it), it's just a slow devolution from there.Summary: Works for a few months, and then becomes dangerous."
1,lasted 1 year,"I bought this about 16 months ago. It was fine, but stopped working after about a year. I then bought another chillpad, the Targus AWE12USX, which includes 4 USB ports, and you can plug it into an outlet rather than using up a USB port. Definitely recommend getting the AWE12USX instead of this one. More money, but worth it."
2,"when it works, it works","This product is very good at cooling my laptop when it is working, but it frequently stops for no discernible reason. Moving it even just a little will usually start it again, but it may only stay on for a few seconds a time. At other times it will run for hours, but the constant adjusting that is so often necessary makes using it a pain."
2,Not Cool,"I bought the chill mat when it was on sale...and yet I still don't feel like I got a deal. The mat IS very loud, but that was of less concern to me than the fact that the USB connector is extremely un-sturdy and became damaged quickly, necessitating the connector to be held down to make the mat work. One handed computing is not my preferred method.Despite these defects, the mat gets the job done, keeping my chronically over heating laptop cool, but I came on Amazon to look for a replacement and ended up leaving this review."
1,NOT a greatest hits album,"This one contains...1. Hard as Rock2. Smooth Up In Ya3. Shoot the Preacher4. Money5. F#96. When Pigs Fly7. Thrill That Kills8. Talk To Your Daughter9. St. Christopher Hang On10. THC Groove11. Slow and Easy12. Rock Candy13. Something Goodfor starters, it's not called ""Money"" but I can look past that, but I can not look past the fact that great hits are missing, like...- Hell On My Wheels- Crank Me UpThey should have replaced songs that where not hits like ""Thrills that Kill"" ... what the hell is that doing on there?Least they included ""Rock Candy"" for once."
4,This is not a reissue of Burning Cats...,"The reviewer above (or below) mistakenly reviewed this as a re-release of the Burning Cats cd. It's a re-release of the Smooth Up In Ya greatest hits released in 2006. It has another 10+ songs though. This collection compiles some of the tribute songs that Marq Torien has done for the Ted Nugent, Bon Jovi, etc. compilations. This is a great collection and you can't beat the $8.99 price. The 2006 remakes of these songs are flawless (with the exception of the intro on Smooth Up). Marq's voice is amazing. Grab this ""cd"" before they raise the price. Where else are you going to get 25 great songs for $8.99?"
4,Wind Beneath Their Wings,"While reading Fairways and Dreams, I can't help but let my eyes fill with tears when learning the stories of such golf greats as Payne Stewart and Amy Alcott. Their determination and drive to succeed inspires me. It's nice to read about amateurs as well, and I was happy to read Beth Bauers' story. I was privledged enough to see her play in several tournaments over the past few years (being a native of Florida) and I must say, she has turned into such a beautiful, accomplished young woman. Her father clearly taught her well. Beth is one of those people whom you know is just special. I think this book helps give others an idea of the talent these people hold,an insight as to who they are, and most importantly,it tells us all about the wind that will always be beneath their wings."
5,Great video!,Great video. My husband is quite ill and now in pulmonary rehab. Watching the DVD helps me to relax so that I can get through another day.
2,BUY THE ORIGINAL SERIES - HIGHER QUALITY PICTURE,"This DVD looks more like poor VHS quality compared to the original DVD released by the producer. So you get what you pay for... but for a few more bucks, buy the original version here on Amazon.com (same name) and get a better picture and a box cover that will match your collection."
5,sexy outfit,This was a good sexy outfit that gives alot of acess to what you want without takeing it off and nice soft materal
4,good product,this product looks as good as on the site nice material and very very very sexy i would use them again if needed anytime
3,Size problem but still rocked it.,"I adored the product in the package. The material felt nice and i felt sexy in the until i had them on for an hour. I am considered full figuared (my honey says curvy) bc i wear size 18 jeans and stand at 5'2"". I had elephant ankles and had to tuck the extra in my shoe making the issue worst. Soooooo i loved the design and texture so much i purchased a smaller size and those cut into my thighs. I made it work and still looked amazing in them. **Note to designers; plus size does not mean tall!!!!"
1,Too small/short,I ordered this for Valentine's day and I got it a few days before V-day. I was really excited to try it on. It looked exactly the same as in the picture. The only thing is that it's too short/small. I am 5'2 and I am size a 3. Imagine those guys who wear their pants really low? That's how it looked on me. I ended up scrunching it and tossing it. I'm so sure that its gonna shrink more if I wash it.
4,Not too stretchy,"These nylons are elegant and stylin but they do not have enoughstretch to conform to the contours of the legs when one is bendingthem. They tend to run small in size so buying a larger size mightbe a good idea. I wear mine with a garter belt so that it doesnot slide down on me. It snags easily but is easy to repair withblack thread since it is mostly holes, anyway."
3,Not the best quality,"They seem to stretch out and not hold their shape, and they don't have enough elastic to go back to shape.THey are pretty, but not great quality."
5,Queen of R&B/Soul,"All That I Can Say is a breath of fresh air in R&B, where lately talent doesn't seem to matter as long as the beat is hot, but Mary proves to everyone that she is the undisputed Queen of R&B/Soul with this song. A collaboration with Lauryn Hill (it was written by her and she sings background vocals), this song is simply beautiful, about the many splendor things you feel when you love someone. Mary HAS talent, unlike many of the current R&B trendsetters, Mary can sing and this song is no exception. She shines on this 70's groove song, it will make you smile. Mary sings about real life, about real things she's experienced, and especially on this song I can feel what shes saying, I feel through her music I can truly understand what shes putting in her music. This single includes the radio edit and album version of All That I Can Say, as well as the radio edit for her hit Beautiful from How Stella Got Her Groove Back. A must have."
5,Sickest stuff out there!,"Dude! Pound Foolish rocks the house. I saw them at Canes andthese guys just give it to you. They play their music as best theycan, and gives you a variety of all flavors. This band rocks! I would like to meet the cute drummer too. I can't wait til their next CD. I'm there! For anyone that wants to know...their website is www.angelicentertainment.com/poundfoolish.htm . Yeah!"
3,"While some new tracks shine, others become repetitive","John Williams has done better. Look at the first two Harry Potter's, ET, and Star Wars. And then look at this.Some of the new tunes are enchanting and enjoyable. My favorite is ""Buckbeak's Flight,"" followed by ""Double Trouble"" and ""A Window to the Past."" However, much of the music keeps popping up over and over and once-exciting themes become boring and repetitive. While a couple, like the ones mentioned above, make this CD fun to listen to, others are begging for the Skip button.If you liked what you heard in the background of this movie, go out and buy this soundtrack. However, be warned you'll only like listening to half the songs or less."
5,YES,If you have seen the movies then I am sure that the music impressed you. If it did then buy this. I love it!
5,One of William's best!,"This CD has got to be one of John Williams' masterpieces. It has beautiful songs on it like Buckbeak's Flight and A Window to the Past. It also has some fun little songs like Double Trouble and The Knight Bus. And loads of other songs. This soundtrack, like the movie, is the best in the series. It is kind of sad that Williams won't be back for ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"". I wanted to see what he would do with that movie. Well, let's hope he returns for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" so we can have another Harry Potter Music Masterpiece!"
5,Great,I am a big fan of John Williams. When I saw this I had to order it. It fantastic for any music lover.
4,Anyone else notice a minor theme missing?,"This is a fantastic score, however, I only give it 4 stars because one of the minor themes used throughout the film is missing. Has ANYONE else noticed? It plays a number of times during the film, generally revolving around the Marauder's Map being used, Peter Pettigrew, and the Shrieking Shack. I'm terribly disappointed that this was not included on the album, but despite that, it is still a great album."
4,Casting A Spell,"I really enjoy this sound track. I would like to have all three of them one day but right now I just have the third one. However, I can't really complain. I personally think that it suits the book very well and of course the movie."
5,Magic!,"This is a great Soundtrack! I think it's the most interesting from the whole Harry Potter series up to now.The Great John Williams has done a really good work.Starting from the main Hedwige's Theme, the listener can live an hour of full amazing entertainment. From Middle Age stiled music, to modern clustered chilling choir harmonies, to exciting rythms and romance... This is CD, trust me, is the real Magic! ;-)"
4,Almost Perfect,"I am a major Harry Potter fan! I have read all the books about 5 times each and have seen the films countless times. I also bought the first two Harry Potter soundtracks and was very satisfied with them. When I purchased this CD and listened to it, I was very pleased with what John Williams did with this score. The reason I gave this album 4 stars was because track 3: The Knight Bus, does not fit in with the rest of the album. It may be that I just don't like this track very much. I think he could have done better while composing this segment. As for the rest of the album, I think it goes well with the film and is great in any Harry Potter collection. Be sure to also pick up the scores for Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets if you haven't already."
3,"It's a shame, really...","I give the score itself a five, but the album only gets about a two. The score for the movie is brilliant, but the album rearanges cues, mixes them together, and excludes so many great cues. However, I would recommend that if you appreciate having any of the music, you buy the album, as I am not sure about the odds of them releasing a complete score."
2,Breaking Tradition,"HELLO? Does anyone out there see that we are breaking the well kept tradition of Hedwig's Theme? I am a creature of habit, and although I don't mind a little change, this is just too much. We are losing a precious thing here! I was upset enough when I heard that the director had done away with the full uniforms, but when I heard that awful knight bus track, I nearly fainted! And what is that thing that looks like a decomposing pig in the front of the bus? And that ""double trouble"" song is one of the weirdest things I've ever heard! Anyway, I think it's stupid to change the soundtrack so much, and people writing these other reviews must have had something injected into their brains while they were sleeping to have given it five stars."
1,The worst score ever,"This score is garbage, the music has absolutley no beat, and no tune. Most songs are surrounded around hedwigs theme, and are basically hedwigs theme played in different instruments, and at a different speed. I hate this cd. I dont own it, but i hear it being played by a sibling. Ugh! How can anyone like harry potter music. The music is just overrated. Harry potter is the worst thing that came upon the human race. I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate harry potter. It is so dumb, children books, for dumb children. A better score is pirates of the carrabein. It is alot better than this trash. this movie and stuff is so overrated. People just say that it is better than it actually is. The movie was bad."
1,sad...,"I LOVE HARRY POTTER TO DEATH!!!! I think its the asomest books and movies in the world! I've read the book maybe like 75 times. But when I heard this soundtrack..I was dissapointed, I never liked this music exept the 1st song... I enjoy wacthing the movies and reading the books A LOT!!! But this CD is like an orchestra with chorus singing..Come on..who would wanna buy this... I would rather listen to my rock songs then this.. thank you very much."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This soundtrack is a whole different story compared to the other two Harry Potter soundtracks. It might be different but it is deffinatly awesome. The songs are very up-beat and moodier. This is one of the best soundtracks that John Williams has composed.
5,Great!!!,"I have always been a John Wiliams fan. He has written amazing music and Harry Potter and the prisioner of Azkaban is no exception. He has created a whole new atmosphere an makes the environment darker than in the other films. He has added not commonly used instruments, like the recorder, and has made this music magical."
5,Thinking about going to Key West.......just for a taxi ride.,"This book should be savored over a couple of weeks....... a story a day max. It should be used like a smile machine. When you think you can't find any humor in the daily grind of life, pop it open and consume a couple of minutes of a poet/story teller/taxi drivers take on life."
1,Mossy Oak Floor Mat,"They are junk, started to fall apart the 2nd week I had them, little pieces of rubber all over, had to throw them out. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this poor of a product"
2,Street glow Under body lighting,"These are truly a great product, but very hard to mount on a 335I BMW, they hang to low and can be broken easily. I would recommend strongly for trucks and vehicles that have more room under the vehicle."
5,Beautiful and engaging book!,"The artwork in this book is so beautiful. It draws you right in and makes you feel as though you are there. The writing is very engaging too. My son and my daughters all love it (ages 3, 6 and 8). All K.Y. Craft's books are incredible. I love them all. The storyline is about a king who thinks the more gold he has, the better. He is granted a wish and chooses to have everything turn to gold that he touches. Unfortunately, his daughter turns to gold when he touches her and he quickly realizes what a curse it is. But, the story has a happy ending when he is given the opportunity to choose to have the ""curse"" removed and return his daughter to herself."
4,Amazing illustrations.,"Each page is like a canvas from the preraphaelite movement. Gold is simmering in the light with each turn to read more of the story. Its a story that most are pretty familiar with, but I love these illustrations, they are what a fairy tale should look like (in my mind).Craft's telling of the story is well done, except at one point I felt like I had accidentally turned two pages (but it really was only one) as the story had skipped more abruptly from point A to B than I would have liked. Otherwise, it is worth buying this book for the art alone."
1,structure problems,"After reading 150 pages of the book, KEEPER OF SECRETS: DAY ONE.I returned it to the bookstore for a refund. The book is poorly structured, has too many subplots and obviously no editing. There are frequent shifts in points of view and the excess of far too many characters makes it hard too see where the author is taking the story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY EVEN IF IT IS ON THE .99 CENT TABLE!!!"
1,Too confusing,"I tried to read this book and found the plot lines and characters too confusing to follow. I bought this book from the author who compared himself to a favorite author of mine, James Patterson, and I'm sorry to tell Mr. Dunson, but he doesn't even come close. Without saying anything about my feelings, I gave my book to 2 friends to get their opinion. They both gave up without finishing it saying that they thougt it was too confusing and couldn't follow it. Remember, when developing characters and plot lines, sometimes less is more. A very disappointing book."
2,New writer has potential..........but too many characters,"I enjoyed the story plot of politics and all the gruesome ""dirt"" that is assocoiated with it. I agree with other reviewers about this book. There are far too many characters in this book!!!!! Reading should be enjoyable and comforting. You should not have to continuously look back over pages to see who is who.The setting in Wash., DC also intrigues me...I feel Mr. Dunson has a great writing style but too too many characters in this novel.Who ...is Sam Chase who was introduced in the last chapter??????? See what we mean, on the last page an new character was injected."
2,Insipid,"At over 300 pages, this debut novel by John Dunson reads like a hopscotch game. Numerous characters, plots and sub plots jumping all over. It is hard to keep up with the story line as no character was clearly developed. From the prolouge we jump 5 years, with the entire story crammed into a 24 hour day. Every other chapter a new character is introduced, without the connection to the previous characters being made clear.There is a sentence in the story that says ""He never knew where he would be from one day to the next."" I had the same ambivalent feeling about the book, I did not know where it was going from one page to the next.Mr. Dunson gave us numerous secrets, lies and murders to be the makings of a great mystery, but did a poor job of tying then together into a readable story. Wonderful creativity, horrible writing and editing. The story just kept going and going. With the sequel Day Two, I can only hope Mr. Dunson makes it clearer.Reviewed by Toni Bonita, APOOO BookClub"
4,EXCITING FROM START TO FINISH,"I must admit, when I purchased this book I thought that due to having such a busy schedule, it would take me some time to complete. But it turns out that from page one, the book is exciting and a real page turner. It took me a little over a day to read.The characters are complex, but not to the point where you loose track of who's done what. The story line is simple, but not so simple for it to be boring or predictable. And because I live in Atlanta, and have friends in Miami and DC, the buildings, streets, and surroundings were familiar to me and I could easily see myself being there as well.I recommend that avid mystery readers pick up a copy of this book!!"
1,Hard to Follow - Needs an Editor,"This book was obviously written by a first time novelist. Too many characters, ill developed plot - in general a waste of time (and money)! Hopefully the author has kept his day job! The most irritating part of the book are the trite sayings that are mistated. If you are going to use a well-known saying, possibly you would want to say it the way in which it became well known!From one author to another - hire an editor (or a ghost writer)."
5,fun in alcapolco,I love this movie. And the price I paid was the cheapest I could find. Im very pleased. Thank you
1,Numb in Acapulco,"All you ask from an Elvis movie is a couple a decent songs and a sense of fun, but this flick can't even manage that. The fantastic Ursula Andress is TOTALLY wasted and Elvis is starting to get that ""just here for muh paycheck"" attitude so common in his later movies. Sadly the music is sluggish too - lazy gunk about bold toros and other s'pozedly Mexican themes, with no rockin' hits at all. If you want a first-rate Elvis from this period I recommend ""Viva Las Vegas""."
2,Elvis almost...not quite...hits bottom,"Whoever rates this movie with 5 stars obviously knows zilch concerning motion pictures as an art form (which it is, by the way). Guided with HORRIBLE management from the illegal alien, Elvis ""shows up for work"" (exact quote). So sad what happened to this guy. I certainly disagree with the 1 star reviews (they know nothing concerning an up-and-starter-turned-into-product-for-the-machine). This movie can be explained in one word... cheap! Everything about it is cheap. No wonder Elvis would later say. ""This whole town (Hollywood) is laughing at me"" (another exact quote). If it were filmed on location, I may even rate it with 3 stars...average. But, of course, that was impossible. Mexico has quite different laws concerning extradition, particularly concerning a possible murder suspect. Why oh why didn't ""E"" fire that guy????"
5,DVD,have been looking for elvis movies to complete my series on DVD found them from this sellerhave ordered several from them in the past ans will order several more thins in the futurelove pricelove value.
4,Jazz,"Jazz being Queen's 1978 and their 7th studio album and received mixed reviews when it was released. Allmusic gave it positive review whilst both Rolling Stone and Robert Christgau gave it negative reviews. I agree with Allmusic and think that this is a dandy of a record. Mercury sounds amazing and the arrangements are as good as ever. Songs that stand out on this release are ""Bicycle Race"", ""Jealousy"" and ""Mustapha"". 4/5."
4,Rock and roll just pays the bills.,"This album by Queen was released in 1978. Despite the album's title, it has no jazz influences on it whatsoever. It sounds like a typical Queen album. There are a number of classic Queen songs on it, like ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", ""Bicycle Race"" and ""Don't Stop Me Now"". There are some other good songs, and a few that aren't that good. The CD features a useless remix of ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", which sounds virtually identical to the original version, and a remix of ""Bicyle Race"", which actually does sound a lot different from the original version. Most Queen fans will enjoy this album."
4,An excellent album featuring a very important stage in the bands development,"This album contains some of Queen's greatest tracks-the rollicking Fat Bottomed Girls , Bicycle Race and one of my favourite Queen songs-Don't Stop Me Now.Also noteworthy are the fast paced Let Me Entertain You and Fun It , the melancholy Leaving Home Ain't Easy and Jealousy , the Middle Eastern style Mustapha and the waltzing 50's style Dreamer's Ball.An excellent album featuring a very important stage in the bands development."
5,very underated,"why is this album so underated? i think mabe it has one song i don't like, ' more of that jazz,' the rest is great. 'jazz' isn't as consistent as their first six albums, mabe that's why it wasn't recieved well by rock fans, but it has gems all over the place, don't stop me now, fat bottomed girls are both classics, also dreamer's ball, let me entertain you, dead on time are all solids tracks."
5,great,"jazz is a very good piece of work. It's a album that somehow gets overlooked. Why one dimensional bands like nirvana and Metallica get so much credit?, and greats bands like queen that always did new and interesting things get overlooked. this has classics like, fat bottomed girls/bicycle race and don't stop me now. Other great songs include the hallroom jazz of dreamers ball, and freddys great mustapha. great mixture of music like ballads jealosy and only seven days to hard rockin entertain you and dead on time make this another solid effort from Queen."
3,THE LESSE GOOD OF THEIR SEVENTIES's CAREER,"""JAZZ"" misfired in some point. I don't know exactly where and why, but it definitely worst than News of the World, A Night at The Opera and all other Queen albuns from the Seventies. There are great songs always, of course. But it is just average."
4,Queen's last great album of the 70s,"A worthy follow-up to 1977's News of the World, Jazz continues the Queen tradition of making a very diverse album, though not so over-the-top as, say, A Night at the Opera. ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" is the best tribute to ""heap-big women"" ever put to vinyl, ""Bicycle Race"" and ""Don't Stop Me Now"" are both classic and a lot of fun. ""Jealousy"" is a typical overblown Freddie Mercury ballad, that works. ""Leaving Home Ain't Easy"" is a sad/breezy Brian May ballad, and ""Dreamer's Ball"" is lighthearted and jazzy, with a sad undercurrent. There are a few weaker moments, including Roger Taylor's rather lame ""Fun It"" (he was always the band's weakest songwriter) and John Deacon's pedestrian ""In Only Seven Days."" On the whole, however, this album works, and is notable as Queen's last of the 70s, the end of an amazing run. As with many artists, the 80s would prove to be trickier and a bit uneven music-wise."
4,Great but not as groundbreaking as previous efforts,"By the time Queen got to Jazz, they'd already broken all the boundaries and proven they could do anything. So on Jazz they appear content to just write and perform songs for enjoyment without feeling the need to push a million different musical limits.There are still some cool studio effects, though nothing overshadowing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". There are still different musical styles, but not the drastic differences we saw on Sheer Heart Attack, A Night At The Opera, and A Day At The Races.So if you're looking for Queen's truly groundbreaking work, try the previously mentioned three albums for a taste of their musical variety, or their epic Queen II album (less variety in musical styles, but many Queen fans' favorite album). Previous albums were more cohesive works of art, while Jazz seems to be simply a collection of songs. But it retains Queen's musical skill and knack for a good melody."
3,They Released Better,"This is one of the later Queen releases, that I feel lacks some of the imagination of their previous work. Each member is represented and contributes at least one song to the disk. Most of the songs are alright, with inclusion of some of the songs from the ""Flash Gordon"" sound track, but I feel there are few standouts. ""Fat Bottom Girls"" was the single, which is a step down from their more sophisticated tunes. I can understand that they were looking for a quirky release, but this does not work for me. In all, it is a decent release, with very few great moments."
4,"Leaving Home"" an overlooked Queen gem","Judging by the various ratings of individual tracks on ""Jazz,"" the song ""Leaving Home Ain't Easy"" is an overlooked gem. Certainly unlike other Queen tunes, there's a true sorrow found in the performance of the song. Maybe I'm the only one to connect to it but it's one of my faves by the band and made the album a satisfying listen for me."
5,One of Queen's best albums...,"Wow. Simply, wow. This album slams you from the very beginning of the first song, ""Mustapha,"" and keeps beating you over the head mercilessly with Queen's absolutely masterful rocking. The entire album is one of their most cohesive, and highlights all the members' insane musical abilities, from Brian May's intense guitar work (""Dead On Time"" is an excellent example) to Freddie Mercury's piercing vocals. This album is just good fun and good music. Queen's tongue-in-cheek sense of humor is rampant (""Let Me Entertain You"" and ""If You Can't Beat Them""), and this album is polished and sharp in its manic pace. This album is for the listener looking for an album to just let loose and rock out to. It's not a casual listening album, but it is guaranteed to entertain you, no pun intended! With the possibility of redundancy on my part, it's GREAT!"
2,Queen In Danger,"When this came out, Queen was having trouble and becoming a bit passe. They were unable to replicate their success with NATO or DATR and were under pressure (pun not intended) to put out product. Jazz succeeds sometimes but does not work as a unit as their previous releases did. Also, the artwork on this release was ghastly (awful cover and poster)."
3,"Has some fine moments, but not one of Queen's best","I very much enjoyed all of Queen's previous albums (with the exception of Queen II, and I'm in the minority in that opinion), but unfortunately I don't care too much for this one. It has some high points (""Don't Stop Me Now"", ""Let Me Entertain You""), but a lot of it isn't really my cup of tea. Your results may vary. To those new to Queen, I'd recommend ""A Night At The Opera"", ""A Day At The Races"", ""News Of The World"", or any of the earlier Queen albums with the exception of Queen II (sorry)."
3,About half and half...,"Jazz was Queen's weakest album of the 70s.Basically, the only songs worth buying this album for are ""Mustapha,"" ""Fat Bottomed Girls,"" ""Jealousy,"" ""Bicycle,"" ""Let Me Entertain You,"" and ""Don't Stop Me Now."" That's about half of the album, maybe a little less.The rest are basically filler and are forgetable. The only other song worth remembering here is ""In Only Seven Days"" it's not the best song on this album, but it's not as weak as the others. Right in the middle.I'd recommend any of their early albums over this."
2,Worst Queen album - But a couple of good songs,"Well, this is where Queen sold-out. Freddie got bored and ran out of Ideas after News of the World. The albums before this album have much more Flavour. If you look at the albums after this - 'The Game' - Funk, 'Hot Space' - Munich Disco, 'The Works' - Weaker Song writing, 'A Kind fo Magic' - Better songwriting, very commericalised though, 'Miracle' - Very late eighties , 'Innuendo' - Better ...... You can see a turning point here. The band, writing to order just churn out another album, titled 'Jazz' for no reason. Freddie and Brians Avant -Garde , Bohemian , exploritory flavours ebb away to a commercial lift music album.Not that good."
2,Limp Pop Metal,"Queens's brand of catchy pop metal was hugely popular in the 70s, but now it all pretty much sounds the same. This album includes the singles `Fat Bottom Girls' and `Bicycle Race', a dubious benefit. If you a casual fan, you probably would be best of with a greatest hits, there is nothing especially inspiring here."
1,"Queen's Crown A Little Rusty On ""JAZZ.""","As a former member of the International Queen Fan Club, I think I speak with some authority when I say that ""Jazz"" is not one of Queen's best albums. Queen's songwriting well seems to have dried up on this one. The songs are weak, forgettable and lack that special Queen ""something."" It sounds like the kind of album bands do when they owe their record company one more album in order to get out of a bad recording contract. The only time I saw Queen was at the Oakland Coliseum on their ""Jazz"" tour. I went to the show hoping they would play their old stuff and a minimum number of songs from the disappointing ""Jazz."" Go play Queen's ""Sheer Heart Attack"" CD right after listening to ""Jazz"" and you'll hear the difference. I don't see any reason to recommend Queen's ""Jazz."" Definitely NOT a high point in their career."
2,Change the Image for the Product!,"While everything arrived in time and great packaging, the banner I received was completely wrong. Rather than receiving the old school Mighty Ducks banner, I received the new Anaheim Ducks banner. I have been looking for the old school Mighty Ducks banner for a long time and have gone through 3 returns with 3 different companies, they all had the wrong image on. So I suggest you change it!"
5,Very Impressed,"Stumbled upon this read, very fortunately. I remembered John Stossel from TV show my economic teacher made us watch is highschool- Greed, I thouroughly enjoyed the thought provoking show and John Stossel has always been vibrant in my memory. The book was amazing, the format he uses to connect with the reader is very casual as if he were in the room with you talking. I love how he grew from him experience and was willing to risk his career for what he was learning was right, even though it all went against his base ideas, and then sighted specific examples. Great read, common sense, should be taught in highschools. KEEP IT UP STOSSEL! YHEA!"
5,spectacular common sense,"Everything that has earned Stossel his place of respect among the myriad of television voices has been stated clearly and cleverly. A great read, can't put it down, don't want it to end!"
5,THIS GUY IS GREAT,"We've been trained by the media to believe that big business is what's wrong with America. We hear every day new stories of the corporate elite sticking it to the little guy. But what we're forgetting is that free market systems are run by PEOPLE. It's all very basic, really.Stossel commendably shines a light on how a competitive, sensationalist media often exaggerates the truth in giving business a bad rap. And instead of letting the free market work, we tend to regulate ourselves to death - creating more costs and problems through legal wrangling than the products and industries we're legislating ever did! Stossel provides eye-opening example after example of how a few overzealous reporters or bureaucratic missionaries can significantly impair the free market - limiting the freedom that makes a free market possible.Clear and concise, it's an easy-to-access book that makes for a great weekend read. I highly recommend."
3,The first half is fairly informative and unpartisan...,"""Give Me a Break"" has some insightful nuggets in it or at the very least an interesting point of view. His views on dwarf tossing legislation may shock and surprise you. But, as you may have guessed from the title, John Stossel's neck must be tired from carrying around such a fat head.John was a pioneering consumer reporter back in the day and has turned the sights of his camera from guys selling Juicy Fruit for 100 bucks a pack as an exotic but tasty aphrodisiac to the political arena. Hey 500-dollar toilet seats are a bigger rip off.The first half is fairly informative and unpartisan. Pointing out that the Emperor truly has no clothes and we were a little dumb for playing along. The second half has political tirades and brow beating not seen since the Lewinski.So, if you have a few bucks lying around or want to read something while your on the can go for it. If you think the $ 12.95 is better spent on a Big Mac... you may be right."
3,"media bias? us?!? heck, no!!","oh, the book's ok. not great, not wretched, just stossel telling his stories. chances are, the closer you are to the ""libertarian"" end of the political spectrum, the better you'll like the book. but as to that ol' ""media bias"" thing.....if you'll notice, on amazon's 'opening page' of the book, the review from publishers weekly is included. using the words ""the conservative bernard goldberg"". (the guy who wrote ""bias"") in ""bias"", goldberg tells us that HE'S NEVER VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT. but because he dares criticize the media, goldberg is described as a ""conservative"". interesting.....and maybe stossel's onto something, eh?"
5,Wonderfully infuriating!!!!!,"This book was both a page turner and hard to turn a page...Here is why:Our system is so frustrating. This book outlines so many flaws in our government spending and media reporting that at times I felt like moving countries (though I know there are problems just as bad elsewhere). Stossel makes valid points which I do not think any liberals would be able to argue logically or intelligently to defend against any of what Stossel suggests. I LOVED this book. I'm 23, female, living in the welfare state and sick of it! This book actually has convinced me that I am a libertarian (my dad, too!).This book will make people, as it has made me, question and take action against government spending and pointless government regulators! Check out the local Libertarians running in your state and maybe we can make a difference."
4,Interesting,"Pretty much a word for word rehash of his 20/20 segments. For those that watch and agree with him, that can be redundant. But, for a new reader, it could be quite interesting. Great Libertarian stuff."
5,Great book for all ages,This book is very easy to read and understand. You don't have to be a Princeton education PHD to understand the well-thought-out concepts John Stossel puts forth in this book. If you like the book don't miss John Stossel's show on the Fox business channel.
4,enlightening,"I have read the Constitution thoroughly several times (for high school and college government classes, and for my own curiousity). It outlines that the Federal government has the power to print money and protect our borders. Somewhere along the way, that same government awarded itself more power, and is now encroaching into every part of our lives... our homes, our workplaces, our personal relationships. And neither major political party is going to do anything about it.In concert with this, a handful of lawyers (not all, but some) have taken our liberties and turned them against us in the name of ""protecting the little guy."" This trend, too, is completely counter to what our founding fathers envisioned.While I don't agree with every opinion in his book (isn't that the mark of a good book--to make us THINK, or ACT???), I am grateful for it."
4,of course liberals attack impircal data,"Why is that a liberal demands ""scientific evidence"", but when it doesnt fit their mantra, its a lie, or its pro Bush. Which reduces their credibity more. This is a good book for anyone who isnt lead by their television, and can create an opinion other then one mention on the liberal media"
4,fun stuff,"a largely entertaining and casual romp through the corridors of irony within popular culture and government, delivered with charm and humor by one of the most loved libertarian commentators around.Fun reading!"
4,A Thought Provoking Case,"""Give Me a Break"" is little more than a printed collection of Jon Stossel's TV specials and investigative reports sprinkled with a dash of biography. Those who have followed the newsman will find little new material, but for a majority of readers it will be an eye opening case for less government and more personal responsibility.Although the Stossel leans to the right, his viewpoint is more Libertarian than Republican, and members of the left and right will be equally offended and supportive of his ideas. Stossel relies mostly on anecdotal evidence (which makes sense given his background), but includes enough statistical evidence to maintain his credibility.Stossel goes after a number of sacred cows, and readers unwilling to hear his side of the issue will have trouble making it through the book. Open-minded readers however, will find a book that may not convince them one way or another, but will definitely make them think."
4,I learned things I did not know,"I learned a lot from reading this book, like silly things that our tax money are used for. I did not know 10 years have to pass before the FDA would approve a product, even something that might be helpful. If you don't know much about the goverment this is a good book to start with."
1,Give ME a break,"Stossel is a simpleton, and his hatred of our government borders on the pathological. Libertarianism is obviously a huge scam."
1,More rightwing looneyism at large,"Want to enjoy living in an fascist dictatorship just like what we've gotten thanks to stolen elections and media propaganda from the same bastardized conservatives who act like (...) by complaining about being persecuted by a mythical ""liberal media"" ? Then read this book and enjoy getting torn down by the rightwing thugs. Wake up Stossel (...) ! There ain't no liberal media and you know it !"
3,Typical inept conservative,"Years ago, Stossel did a very poorly conceived story about india's liberal government (something that had just started at the time) vs. ours.You know, India, that country where all our jobs are going? The one where 150,000 engineers have been graduating each year? I wonder if John would like to do a followup story and see how things have changed in a decade.If you read this john, all I can say is you need to think harder, and go deeper in your stories. What you see on the surface is usually not what lies underneath."
1,Give ME a break!,This is one of the most horribly researched books I've read! Great premise and entertaining writing style - just really - get the facts straight please! Too much misinformation for my taste.
1,give US a break,"I found this book left on an empty bus seat, and though it cost me nothing [other than the bus fare + transfer] I STILL feel I got ripped off. Now it is no longer a wonder to me that such a recent release would be left abandoned on public transit. Pure dreck written in a smug, insulting style."
5,Only buy if you can read for ten hours or more at one time!,"John Stossle is equally vigilant on democrats and republicans alike. Although I don't agree with him on everything (mostly his views on making drugs 100% legal) he writes book that mixes personal views with interesting accounts.A lot of people who don't agree that America is on the wrong path with Government interaction and the removal of privatization complain about this book. If you read with an open mind you will see he is a great writer. I recently moved from NY to MT and haven't been able to watch the Yankees until the post season. I actually read his book while watching game 3 of the ALCS because I couldn't put it down.Fun quote ""Why should we do a story on exploding BIC lighters? Toilets drowned 4x as many people last year"".Bottom line- explains the proof behind why capitalism is needed for our country to run as well as it can."
5,"Finally, someone tells it how it is","Thank you, John. At least a few people in the media have the guts to stand up and tell it like it is."
5,Outstanding libertarian commentary,"If you like the works of Ayn Rand, and you watch Stossel on 20/20, you'll love this. Terrific common-sense approach to the issues Americans are faced with every day. I admire Stossel and his viewpoints- particularly about private industry doing things better than government ever could. Also, despite what some liberals might like to believe after seeing the cover, this book does not bash liberals. The author simply makes the point that New York liberals live in a vacuum where conservative ideas such as his are frowned upon. In summary, well worth the money."
4,Downright practical,"Stossel defends a robust free-market even to the point of offering reasons that price gouging is valuable as he adds solid reasons why raising the minimum wage actually makes matters worse for the poor. He takes on a lot of liberal ""common sense"" as he further explains throwing more money at public schools is not effectual.I may not agree with all of Stossels suggestions, but he makes one contemplate one's social and economical assumptions.And He's now on Fox."
1,"So how did he bust them? Why, he joined them of course !","Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them ""liberals"" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad !"
1,Give ME a Break!,John Stossel will never be accused of overthinking an issue. This guy is a complete simpleton. This book reads like it was written in a weekend. John should stick to his day job.
5,Must Read for Every American Citizen,"Most Americans are what I call ""default liberals"". John was too, and he shows how most people, including me, have an epiphany of the faulty logic involved in modern liberlism, and make the slow, painfull transformation away from these feel-good yet harmful policies. This isn't a difficult or very acedemic book on libertarianism, but it is the best ""starter"" for anybody getting into politics I have ever read."
3,Balance,"""Give Me a Break"" is a book worth reading. It portraits Stossel's professional life and what he has learned during his several years as a consumer reporter. However, the reality can be reported in many different ways depending on the author's point of view. Stossel reveals many truths about government. Although, his writing is (a great part of it) based on his opinion, he makes a good point when trying to convince people that government should not be totally in charge of a country. He defends that private companies in charge would balance our society better."
1,"Transparent, predictable","The publisher wanted my opinion on this book. Well, I've already reviewed one book by a crank skeptic. This here is the second.From the beginning, you know what the author is going to say. But, did you know that he has business arrangements with some of the most right wing foundations in the country? Yeah, so you know what he's going to say again and again.It's hard to read. Just ask yourself: if I were reporting for a right wing foundation, what would I be compelled to say? You're right: you'd say exactly what Stossel says. He must find it easy, at least lucrative, to live without a conscience.By the way, Stossel is one of the major reasons I won't even allow 20/20 on the television in my house--or any television ""news"" for that matter.If you're after any sense of honesty or objectivity, this ain't the volume to spend any time on. It's about as objective as the National Enquirer."
1,"no, give US a break...","Is there anything even remotely useful left in this windbag? He has become such a vile entity to thought, such a contradictory, bellicose derriere-wipe that it is painful to even acknowlege his extistence. Why is this tome still in discussion? Remand it, and discard this dup. Which spelled backwards is..."
1,Big talk big deal.,"For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt."
5,Stossel for President!,"If you have ever heard the expression, ""there isn't a dime's worth of difference between the Republicans and the Democrats"", then this book is for you! John Stossel uses many examples of how government and court cases makes life worse for us rather than better. He doesn't promote theories but gives concrete examples of policy and court events and the ending results. He makes a strong and convincing argument for litigation overhaul.He should subtitle this book, ""A Common Sense Guide for America""."
4,Pioneering journalist with a pioneering view,"John Stossel will someday be recognized for this audacity to take on the government, the media, and the powerful to bring us the truth, which is far more elusive than it seems. I particularly like his take on the media's obsession with FEAR and how it impacts our thoughts and behaviors to a point of paranoia. I loved his lawyer bashing and the revelation of how our legal system really works. This man is not afraid to stand up for what is truthful, even at the expense of making many enemies, purported even within his own news organization. He loves to cut through the bull and bring you to the real motivations and dealings of some of the most crooked people and schemes devised (most of them legal AND from our own government).My main qualm with this book is he is not totally objecive. The man is a self proclaimed and an obvious libertarian. I wish he had been little more balanced in his views."
3,"I've heard worse, but...","...in Tangerine Dream's case, this is not a commendable effort in my opinion. They went for a new sound with this CD - more of a pop approach rather than sticking with the style that made them so successful. To be honest, this CD really lacks the character that TD's better works possess. The best way I can describe it is to say that it sounds like a bunch of theme songs from bad 80's drama shows. No, I'm not kidding."
2,Tangerine Dream's darkest hour?,"This album is an unimaginative collection of some 11 5-minuters, nearly all of which sacrifice the traditional Tangerine Dream approach of innovative and varied synthesiser and sequencer programming for a uniformly bland sound world of everyday synthesiser string washes and jangling guitar lines over a relentlessly boring rock drum-machine beat. Gone is the variety of tempo of earlier albums. In fact, gone is any great variety of anything! Only the short `Penguin Reference' manages to capture some of the sparkle of earlier Tangerine Dream successes, while the incorporation of alto sax into the tracks `Body Corporate' and `Red Roadster' give some new interest and also look ahead to the later incorporation of Linda Spa to the group.(For a fuller review of this disc, see its entry on the amazon.co.uk site.)"
2,Stagnantly digitized and over effected,"What's missing from this album in my opinion is the genuine soulful moods that albums like 'Le Parc', 'Poland', 'Force Majeure', and 'Optical Race' provided. What's missed even more is the last key element (the former to the last being Paul Haslinger in the lineup and before him Chris Franke) to that soulfulness most folks don't recognize-- Edgar Froese's uncanny guitar solos! Instead of passionate and intelligent guitar melody countering the syths, Rockoon offers leadened egghead riffiness from a Satriani-esque player, Zlatco perica.I found myself annoyed through this album mostly though I will have to say that I like Red Roadster and Big City Dwarves.I'd recommend Turn of the Tides, or The Goblins Club where I feel the 'New' sound has come together a bit more."
3,A fairly decent album.,"Rockoon is a fairly decent album from Tangerine Dream. I've had this disc for a few years. I admit that I don't listen to it that often though. The production and musicianship are very good, but I find that a lot of the songwriting just isn't that captivating--that doesn't mean that most of the songs are bad though. The songs that I like the most are ""Big City Dwarves,"" ""Touchwood,"" and ""Girls on Broadway."" I've only got a handful of releases from Tangerine Dream. I pretty much lost interest in them a while back because I felt that they tended to be repetitious. This isn't a favorite of mine, but it still has some good moments. Rockoon is worth a listen."
3,"My dad loves Chet, but lots of bad language on this CD",My dad has been a Chet Atkins lover for years....but this particular CD he said had lots of bad language from Lester....and he did not appreciate that part....but the music was good.
5,One of the best guitar albums ever,"This album focuses on two of the greatest guitarists, who you can easily hear their different styles on this recording.The production and material is brilliant as well.Once you could find this recording on a two for one cd, with the other recording they did called Guitar Monsters.Les Paul supposively showed up with a cold and the performance is not as good. There is more joking around as well.Never the less, if that recording, buy it. Else, purchase this recording.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
4,Great Guitar,"Although the music is excellent, I don't particularly like the talking. It's very distracting and the album would have been much better off without it."
5,GUITAR MUSIC AT IT'S BEST!,"I have always liked good guitar music and I thoroughly enjoyed Chester and Lester. I played it on my computer while I was e-mailing and then I played it at least 3 more times while I was playing games. I can't play it enough. If you like guitar music, this is a good buy."
2,MORE MINDLESS CHATTER THAN MUSIC,Was disappointed with all the idle chatter that i did not relate to and some language I found to be offensive and distracting. These two men are capable of some great music and wasted time that would have been far better spent in musical entertainment. Am sorry I spent money on this disk.
4,chet and les,this cd is just what I expected it to be. Both men are masters of their instrunebts and show it every bar of every song.
3,"Good story,unstructured ending","This book was quite enjoyable to me up until the end. It just seemed like the story could have gone on for atleast another 50 to 100 pages. It almost seemed like he was tired of writing so quickly jotted down an ending. Sure you expect strange things in Sci Fi, but this ending was just unstructured.Im glad I read it, but wish it was a bit more thought out."
2,hope you like Blish alot,"some cool stuff going on and good ideas as usual with the Blish 'non-star-trek' books, but the chatacters don't hold as strongly as they do in the Cities novels. I kept it in the bathroom so I finally finished it."
3,Catholic SciFi,"Strange book. The author sets secular humanism against Catholicism, and never once considers any other viewpoint, e.g. Protestantism, much less Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, agnosticism. In Blish's world you're either Catholic or atheist. Was Blish a practicing Catholic?I regretfully disagree with those people who say the story is ambiguous -- I think Blish makes it clear we are to believe that the priest's take on Lithia is the right one. I could recommend this book to orthodox Catholics, or alternatively to nonCatholics who are willing to accept Catholicism as a premise.But as an *ex*-Catholic myself, this book left a bad taste in my mouth. I usually enjoy SciFi for the sense of opening up new imaginitive avenues, but this book seems more intent on closing them. Depressing."
2,"The Forerunner of Barney, the Dinosaur","This story was mainly one of concepts; there was very little action. It was written in the 50's. I enjoyed reading the 21st century characters discuss what happened in the late 20th century--they mostly missed the mark, but that's more interresting than guessing correctly. The most amazing ""prediction"" made was one of a 9 foot dragon who hosts his own television show. This somewhat comical show was viewed mainly by children. However, some adults (including the protagonist--a Roman Catholic priest), believed this dragon was really a demon. Does this sound like Barney, or what? I found the ending dull and the plot thin. However I appreciated: a) its lack of flowery descriptive paragraphs (always boring), b) its absence of pornography (always stupid and immature), c) its willingness to attack SciFi from a serious religous perspective (the priest was not a buffoon, but intelligent and respected)."
1,looks great but the hinges suck,"It'd be so nice if someone still made a quality product... but toilet seats, like everything else, seem to be made to a price and appearance not actual functionality. i bought one of these in my local big box last year and was really happy about it because I hate those cheap-looking, grunge collecting plastic hinges. These looked quality and easy to keep clean. But they're pot metal and the chrome is peeling off after a year.Someone please make a toilet seat that will last as long as the wood it's made of and I will buy it, I don't care if it costs $50.Other than the fact that the materials the hinges are made of are garbage, it's actually a nice, attractive, comfortable seat.Edit: I found the seat that this is trying to emulate, check out the ones at signaturehardware dot com. They sell seats with hinges of real chrome plated brass so they won't corrode and peel. No affiliation, just a satisfied customer."
1,likewise,"The hinge design is more contemporary than retro, in case you have a preference, however, the chrome started peeling after just 6 months. I too would pay more for a quality product."
3,"Giorgio Brutini Men's 805752 Boot,Dark Brown,8 W US","I purchased this for my husband who likes this style of boots. These are his comments: These are over the ankle boots but don't go up to his calves. Wish they went higher, but are ok. Worn only once, seems comfortable for their style. If you're a size 8, get the wide fit, not the regular fit and you won't be sorry. Price could have been lower, but if you want something like these, They're the only game in town."
1,Not worth buying,"Nothing new here, you get a bit of extra answering machine nonsense added onto freak out and the unmixed intro to hydroponic, however all songs can be found on the music album.311 then go and recycle these 2 'b-sides' for the all mixed up single!No need to get unless you are a completist"
2,Stay well key packs,"This product is great when it works. For some reason, the tags keeps shorting out, and I keep having to buy more of them and they're not cheap! I wish I knew why they short out and stop working because my dog loves the freedom."
2,Totally fiction,"The book is very well written, the problem with this book is the content of it.The author tries to portrait Noriega as innocent, the victim of a goverment that will do anything to put him out.Everybody likes him and he has done nothing wrong.As a Panamanian, that lived in Panama during Noriega's dictatorship, I know what really went on .The information that this book contains is misleading to the reader that didn't live in Panama during those years.People might start thinking that Noriega is a saint."
4,Works Fine,"This RW is okay. I began recording CDs within minutes (after the setup).... the only problem is the size of the external drive is quite large considering they don't have to be this large anymore. This is 3 or 4 times the size of a portable CD player. Also, the software installation takes quite a long time, but nothing went wrong.And although it says it writes at 12x, i can only record at 4x.... not sure what the problem is."
2,Get a power cord,"I agree with the first reviewer. Not only does this expensive thing stick out to much, but you can find a power cord (Go to a music equipment supplier) that will do a much better job at a fraction of the price and the thing just might go 90 deg. in the correct direction."
5,A book I use everyday in my Preschool class,"I have used this book since the late 80's. We learn about a new letter every week, and I use many ideas as letter projects or jobs. I will scale them to fit the developmental needs of the children. The younger ones may just color and glue items on, and the older ones will trace, cut out, and glue items onto the letter on the project. For instance we may do frogs, and put freckles on the F using fingerprints. We tend to get crazy with all the letter things we can do. I love how it covers all aspects of the curriculum. It is one piece of my lesson plan pie."
4,Coloringbook,This seems like an eduacational coloring book. I got a good price on a used one so I considered worthwhile. It does offer lots of ideas too.
1,This is NOT the unrated version.,"This is NOT the unrated version, so I don't recommend getting it. Unless you like paying $22.46 + shipping for an hour-long movie with bad acting, a poor script, and no real scenes."
4,An inspiring story,"I purchased Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot for my god daughter because I liked the message. When I saw that there was a more in-depth description of the ""candy bombing"" for adults, I had to read it. Though the story is sometimes a little too detailed with specifics geared to pilots, don't let that deter you from an inspiring read. After reading this book, you can't help but wonder what magic you can make with the smallest of deeds or resources."
5,The Berlin Candy Bomber,My grandson is very interested in this era. I selected this particular view point for his liking. It was a hit as I expected. Also it arrived as they said and in perfect condition! MK
3,What Could One Expect?,"I wanted to make dishes with very few stages after the blender. The Blender Bible has a few but for the most part it contains beverages. I was surprised that it contained a recipe for an anchovie dip from Northern Italy, served hot. It's called Bagna Caulde or ""hot bath."" It tasted like perfection. I learned to make Bagna Caulde from older Northern Italians and was not disappointed at all in this recipe within Blender Bible."
2,Disappointing,"When I picked up this book I was hoping for smoothie recipes that I can make in the blender. Thankfully I didn't buy this book. It only had about 10 or so pages devoted to smoothies. The Blender Bible is a comprehensive book that features more than 400 recipes: 100 mixed drinks, 100 baby foods, 100 soups, sauces and marinades 100 other recipes. I could see this book being helpful if you want to feed your baby natural foods but other than that, I found it useless."
5,Worth One-Hundred Stars,"I have trouble believing that this book is not a famous novel or a renowned classic!I really liked this book and it's one of those books that just moves you to tears.I knew I liked it by the end of the first chapter, I knew I really loved it by the end of the fifth,and at the end of the book I determined it as my favorite book. It was based on the life of a girl much envied,but the story, taking place behind the scenes, mainly tells about her many troubles and eager resolvements andthe sweet story of how she came to Jesus and heard the beloved message that we all know. I was up late one nightdetermined to finish it, and at one point I was beginnning to think there was too much misery and too many deathsin the poor girl's life! She had troubles enough of her own! but, reader, no matter how far you get and how sad it gets,I advise you to keep on reading and maybe you'll see why this is the best book I have ever read."
1,Not the original,"Buyers beware - this is not the original book, but has been revised and updated by Christopher Wright and given a Happy Ending."
3,"Professional sounds, but a bit too sad","The little girl's mother dies in this story, so I don't know if I would let grade school children listen to this without parents with them for the entire time they listen.Over all it is very professional and easy to listen to. But on the whole, if you are having a bad day these may tend to make your sad mood worse ( I know from personal experience ).*** Please note: I have listened to every single one that I have left a review on. And yes, they are melancholy and may really bother some listeners!"
2,Sounds cooler than it is,"So who doesn't buy a movie that has the F word in the title? I know...............someone who knows better. Yes thinking I would at this to my collection of bizarre movies, watching it was like trying to cut your wrists with a butter knife. It felt like forever with no good results. I would recommend this movie for someone who wants to punish their kids for being bad. Or maybe for a sick form of torture this one's for you. Poor quality filming, terrible acting, and extremely low budget. Save your money."
4,Cheaper to keep her,I love this movie and have been looking for it for a long time. Amazon.Com was the only place that I could find it. This is a great movie and it beings back and lot of memories.
5,amazing grace!,"counting backwards is a great 90's rocker, same sun is a great slow boiler, but...this version of amazing grace is the best version i have ever heard. i first heard it when it came out in '91 from a friends copy, and i basically had to wait for the internet to flourish to find my copy. but, man, was it worth it. such a cool, steady guitar march, which slowly builds into an inspirational and transcendent reverie. unbelievable.this is simply one of my favorite songs, period.p.s. for another fantastic version of amazing grace, check out the daniel lanois album 'acadie' (which is also a great, great album)."
5,GREAT PRCE,"Looke for days for a PINK toilet seat, to no avail. Found it on Amazon very pleased, perfect in every way.. Great value for the price.."
1,Old Retro Music,"As Obi-Wan Kenobi would have stated - ""this is not the 12 O'Clock High"" you are looking for. It's a collection of music videos from ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"", mostly of nobodies. I suspect by looking at the rest of the reviews here that the only reason any of this crap gets sold is because of the confusion with the TV series of the same name. Probably the reason the title was selected. BUT, I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MORE TIME TO READ THE REVIEWS SO, SHAME ON ME !!"
3,Not The Show I'm Sure,"Just posting this because Amazon (who I buy a bunch from) is linking this to the show Rat Patrol thinking this was the TV show Twelve O'Clock High. I'm positive it's not. I think its music videos from either a band of that name or a compilation of bands ( I see now its a compilation). I also think the reference to the name is either to a high school, or the act of being stoned by noon, lol. Since I have no clue what it is I'm giving a neutral 3 stars but I mean even the packaging is misleading as it is similiar to stuff I saw for the TV show. I'd like to see Grandpa the belly gunner's face when you give him this as a stocking stuffer at christmas, lol."
1,12 o'clock high (Volumes 1 & 2),I told Amazon. Com to remove this item to to its only a piece mill collection of some music events. I would not recommend buying this DVD. This has nothing to do with the WW2 Movie by the same name.
5,Bei Mir Bist Du Schon,"The soundtrack to ""Swing Kids"" is amazing! I watched the movie and was deeply touched! Can you believe that I am only 14 years old and I LOVE the swing music? Most kids my age likes the music that they are playing on the radio nowadays. I am hooked on the swing music."
1,"Sing, Sing, Sing","I loved the soundtrack of the movie, that's why I bought this CD.I was very disapointed by the quality and the order of recording.It's impossible to listen to without changing the volume from one song to the next. Great songs like Sing, Sing, Sing, and Bei mir bist Du schoen are available on other CD's with better sound quality. I would not have purchased this CD knowing what this recording sounds like."
5,Fabulous!,"This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard! If you're a fan of classic swing, this is a must-have! If you're not a fan, you will be after listening to this soundtrack!"
5,A Soundtrack that makes the feet move & the heart beat quick,"This is a wonderful soundtrack that can make even the most hard-core rocker appreciate Big Band music. Rineheart, Goodman, Basie, Ellington, and others were wonderful musicians whose music inspired the soul and lifted the feet to the dance floor. This movie/soundtrack is what first got me interested in the music and people of this era and now I do extensive reserch on the subject. Swing Heil!"
4,"Swing, kids!!!","Living in Germany during World War II, but don't necessarily agree with the dictatorship? Well geez, let's rebel by dancing. The Swing Kid movement, as portrayed by this movie, was rather bizarre, considering that they were risking their lives and showing it by dancing the night away. However, the music is light, bouncy and rather catchy, considering many of the tunes on this CD are catchy and jazz standards. One of the downfalls however, is that this engergetic music is paired up with what is often over-dramatic and sullen classical music, to supplement the storyline (you didn't think Hitler would let these rebels have their way, did you?). But when you're in the dancing mood, this soundtrack is definitely well worth it, and if you love jazz music, please do go get this. Just be sure to skip the dreaded, down-tempo classical pieces."
5,"""Swing Kids"" is your definite swing experience.","Since the rebirth of swing, a myriad of movies have provided the swing era as a backdrop. This fashionability has even led to movies about the fashionability of swing such as,""Swingers."" But nothing redefines and enhances the music better than a good movie, drawing out the struggles and the victories that the characters endure while being accompanied by their only call of their generation: swing. Listening to such greats as Benny Goodman can cause the nostalgia to pour out--not to mention the heart-tugging original score with beautiful full piece orchestras. This is a must have in your music library!!!"
5,"If you liked Bored of the Rings, you'll LOVE this","It's a shame that this parody is out of print and less well known than its sister parody, ""Bored of the Rings."" Doon is funnier than BOTR, and its parody is more on the mark. (The jokes aren't _quite_ on the same level as those in BOTR. <g>)If you loved Frank Herbert but got sick of his Dune books after a while, you'll love Doon. This writer knows just how to skewer his style.This book is about the _dessert_ planet, a planet almost entirely covered with sugar. The natives have a myriad of names for the sugar -- brown sugar, granulated sugar, confectioner's sugar... If you're such a staunch Herbert fan that this offends you, stay away.Anne M. Marble -- All About Romance"
4,This parody is hilarious - a must read.,"When I read the original Dune series I was really too young to fully appreciate the breadth of the work, and also to young to really recognize its failings. Several years later I read Doon and was left in tears of mirth through many passages. Weiner's coverage of Herbert's scenes and premises is quite remarkable. His twisting of names (Padded Bra Emperor, Mauve bib, Getty Premium, and, my favorite: Spilgard) is inspired. I love the idea of replacing the exotic ""spice"" of the original with simple beer. It has been a number of years since I read the parody, but I still remember it with fondness and I am looking for a used copy."
3,"Doon, a Dune parody.","The book is funny but mainly to those who have read the original Dune books, or at least seen the movies. The books biggest problem is it's dated in it's references. Younger readers will have a hard time seeing the humor that is 40 years old. Many products and cultural happenings refered to are long gone and mostly forgotten. If you are a fan of the Dune series the book is a good read just for fun."
3,moderately amusing,"Weiner hilariously sends up some of Herbert's most egregious excesses and in particular hits Herbert's ponderous names dead on. His takeoffs on some of Herbert's central premises are less inspired. A good book to take to the airport, but not a must-read."
1,BRILLIANT,"HA! NORMALLY I DISAGREE WITH PEOPLE WHOSE CREATIVE OUTLET LIES MERELY IN PARODYING OTHER,BETTER AUTHORS, WORK,BUT THIS BOOK HAS AN EXCUSE IN THAT IT IS MERELY EXEMPLIFYING HOW STUPID DUNE WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE.IN FACT THIS A BETTER BOOK BY FAR AND IS PERFECTLY HILARIOUS.SOME JOKES MAY ESCAPE THOSE IGNORANT OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL BUT THERE ARE LAUGHS TO BE HAD AND PLENTY OF THEM."
5,closes the case on dozens of whacko conspiracy theories,"I read this book years ago after having read such garbage as Lifton's book and Thompson's total fantasy. I need not comment on the merits of Mr. Posner's book. Instead I want to offer rebuttal made by a conspiracy buff several letters back. He made the point that after standing near Oswald's perch himself, he concluded that Oswald's feat would have been impossible becaus ethe shots would have had to pass through the branches of some trees. HELLO!!! Is anybody in there? In 1963 the trees were smaller and Oswald fired over them. There are dozens of photographs from 11/22/63 that show this to be true. Oh my God, I've just destroyed another conspiracy theory! See how easy that was! Case closed!!!"
1,"Sometimes, you get what you want...","The same folks that make FOX News #1 will adore it!How to prove a point: show that your mark is a ""bad man"".Therefore, he did it.Sleep, now, my children, hush-a-bye."
1,FODDER FOR THE EASILY FOOLED,"I've read 10-15 books on the Kennedy assassination. This book is a sham. Posner does everything that he accuses the Conspiracy ""buffs"" (what exactly is a buff anyway?) of doing. Posner is selective with evidence, distorts witnesses testimony and in some cases, flat out lies about the evidence. There's too many examples of this for me to list here. If you'd like to know more type in; Gerald Posner, case closed, lies, into any search engine."
3,A good arguement that I didn't buy,"While Gerald Posner's research into the Kennedy killing appears to be top notch in Case Closed, his reliance on the Warren Commission, then admission to its ineffectiveness makes his book very difficult to except once you get through it.Certain parts of the Case Closed make for interesting reading for sure, especially the portrayal of Oswald's marriage, but Posner is too quick to label every major player ever brought up in the assisnation as a weirdo, nutcase, ext. This reliance on turning people such as Jack Ruby into a loud mouth or a George de Mohrenschildts into an excentric. ext, just grows tiresome and sounds to convienient for an anti-conspiracy arguement."
2,fact or fiction?,"On the surface this book presents a very convincing argument that can hardly be disputed. Mr. Posner however, lacks in the accuracy of his sources, leading one to believe that a majority of the book may be completely made up. A good deal of the footnotes he has cited are inaccurate, or simply made up. This leads one to question (with good reason) if any part of his book actually contains the truth, or merely the lies Mr. Posner wishes us to believe."
2,Posner Plays it Safe,"Well researched & well presented arguments, but the bottom line here is that the author is on the side of convienence - its much easier to argue that there is no conspiracy since there has never been a conviction in this case. Remember, it is much more difficult to prove the existence of a conspiracy. Perhaps Posner's book came as a mainstream media induced response to Oliver Stone's JFK ? Whatever, this book does not inspire me, I choose to believe that Oswald did not act alone."
1,OJ should hire Posner,"This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizeable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing ""scientific"" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it, for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations."
3,As erroneous as some of the conspiracy theories criticized,"Mr. Posner, a lawyer, created an argument in a manner that might work in the courtroom, but will not work under the bright light of reason. Selectively using ""facts"" that serve to support his hypothesis, he ignores those that do not (eg, the Mauser the police first described, the missing clip, the paper-wrapped package LHO carried the morning of the assassination as described by his friend Buell Wesley Frazier, etc.). He stoops so low as to malign witnesses who contradict his pet theory. Only the truly uninformed could believe after reading this tome that the case is closed. Mr. Posner: It's sad that you have no better grasp of the situation than some of the conspiracy theorists you ridicule. Tsk, tsk."
2,Leaves out critical information ....,"For instance, Posner doesn't tell the reader that he pulls most of this book from only half of the work of Failure Analysis. Failure Analysis did their research work for the American Bar Assocation by developing both the prosecution and defense cases for an ABA mock trial of Oswald. As a result, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Posner gives the reader only the prosecution case -- not the defense case. And, to the reader concerned about Oswald's ""landlady"" getting him the job at the Book Depository, that's not exactly accurate as the job was obtained through Mrs. Ruth Paine, Marina's friend and the person with whom Marina and the children lived .... and who was introduced to the Oswalds through George de Mohrenschildt, a shady character indeed who commited suicide after being subpoenaed to testify before the Congressional committee investigating the deaths of JFK and MLK in the late 1970's."
2,case closed lee harvey oswald and the assassination of jfk,Mr. Posner does not explain how a person without a spotter can fire a rifle with a telescopic sight so quickly and accurately.Oswald could have been the lone assassin if the sights on the rifle he used were not telescopic.
1,"Well, Peter Jennings bought it...",Why even bother to read this book? It's clear Kennedy was shot in the front of the head and magic bullets don't exist on earth. Some dealership is missing one helluva used-car salesman.
1,BRAIN CLOSED,"THis book is horrible, written with the bad intention of making easy money without absolutely any seriur research. If you wanna have a clue about the truth, read ""BLODDY TREASON""."
4,Good book for researchers.,"Case Closed by Gerald Posner helped me in my study of the assassination. Although I think Posner could have put more of the photographic evidence in the book to support his conclusions and theories about the actual assassination , his chapters about Oswald and Ruby were done well. I think anyone whether or not they believe the lone gunman theory should have this book in their collection of assassination books."
1,Garbage,"This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizeable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing ""scientific"" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it, for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations."
4,Stop reviewing the title!,"This book is well written, well organized and plain entertaining. It presents one -- AS IN 1 -- explanation of the facts and theories that will forever swirll around the assassination, and it does so in a convincing and thought-provoking manner. If you're debating whether or not to buy this book, as an interested reader, I highly recommend it.On the other hand, if you have already convinced yourself that either the lone gunman explanation or one of the dozens of other theories is set into bedrock, there really isn't any point on you reading anything about it ever again, is there? If nothing will ever dissuade you from the beliefs you now hold, move along. I hear ""The Neverending Story"" is a good read.Anyone open minded enough or just plain curious enough to read a well-wrought piece of non-fiction about a very, very controverisal event in American history should pick up a copy of ""Case Closed."" Remember, Occam's Razor can account for many things. Even a simple shooting."
2,Why did this attorney stop practicing....,It is easy to see why Mr Posner gave up practicing law. As a firm believer in a conspiracy of some sort; I felt it useful to read a book with another view.The more I read: the less convinced I was that there was any chance of a single gun man.There was so much conjecture raised by Mr Posner. A good lawyer would have taken questioning to its logical ends.There were too many unanswered questions left to close the case.Read the book folks: regardless of your point of view.If you are a questioning person; you'll have thousands of unanswered questions. If this book convinces you that there was no conspiracy - drop me a line.... I have a few 1000 acres of Florida to sell you.
1,We are not buying it.,"Gerald Posner's, Case Closed, is the todays modern day version of the Warren Commission. Look only at the facts, photos, and testimony that will point to a lone killer, most notably, Lee Oswald. Ignore important testimony, important photos, and important facts. But no matter what, Posner still can't explain the head shot to JFK. Posner goes by the same terms that Arlen Spector, now a Senator for Penn., goes by. The backwards motion was the result of a nuerological spasm. Posner says that JFK's head went forward slightly, and then backwards violenty due to a neurological spasm? HA. that's pretty funny. maybe Posner should take a look at Newton's 2nd law of motion."
4,"well-researched, systematic, convincing","This was a difficult subject and many books have been written about it. Mr. Posner investigated every theory thoroughly and brought out each inconsistency. I'd like to have him as my lawyer. Each page held my interest, though at times the train of thought or argument was hard to follow. One hallmark of a good book is if it inspires a desire to learn more about the topic. The next book I read was the Findings of the Warren Commission itself."
3,More Credible than the Warren Commission,"This is a good book. Posner's explanation of the three-shot sequence and why the first shot missed is a far more believable theory than anything coming out of the Warren Commission. Still, it appears that Posner's mind about the assassination events was made up before he did any investigating and he comes off as a dedicated Warren Commission apologist and supporter.Ultimately I did not believe his conclusions (I am still waiting for the first good explanation of FRAME 295), but his logic and thinking have merit.I recommend this book for open-minded thinkers and researchers as a reasonable case for one assassin."
3,You feel like you know Oswald and Ruby personally.,"This book has a well developed history of both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby, i.e. you understand their personalities and pysche very well, which helps the reader to understand the motives behind both of their actions. It also delves into the conspiracy theorists criticisms of Oswald being the lone gunman, but quickly dismisses all conspiracy theories. Like all books on this subject, the book is written with a bias - this one towards Oswald acting alone. Maybe one day there will be a book that presents both sides of the debate on JFK's assassination without bias. Finally, this book is a big let down in the final chapter. It hardly lives up to the rest of the book, which is hard to put down."
1,Nothing new,"Of the hundreds of ""Kennedy"" books we have all read, this is clearly the most worthless. It is nothing but a rehash of the Warren Report, sprinkled with ""computer"" models...the later of which are spurious at best. Posner has done nothing to answer the questions regarding Oswald's life and character and relation to federal employment. He has incessantly refused to answer any of the general questions regarding the contradictions between the original Warren Report and subsequent information. I wonder who really compiled this nonsense of ""Case Closed."""
5,For anyone more interested in truth than sensationalism...,"...this should be a must read. Very detailed, well written.Question: How many people can conspire to keep a secret on such a tremendous scale for decades, especially people in government (notorious leakers in general)?As much as apparently many people would like to believe there must have been some grand conspiracy that brought down a very popular President who was larger than life, the evidence (which, as Posner's book details, is quite overwhelming) proves that the Warren Commission's conclusion was absolutely correct: that a ""sole nut"" brought down President Kennedy. No grand conspiracy, just a horribly sad tragedy."
2,Osawlds jacket found after Tippet killing??,"Posner wrote that Oswalds tan jacket was found near a filling station after the Tippet shooting implying that he took it off en route to the Texas Theater during his flight from killing Tippet. He stated that after leaving the TSBD and arriving at his rooming house, he changed into the jacket and picked-up his revolver. Posner then claimed that the found jacket was Oswalds and that Marina had identified it as the one Lee wore the previous night at the Paines. How could that be? If he had the jacket when he rode with Buell Frazier to work on the 22nd, why would he need to go to the rooming house to get it since he already had it in his possession?"
4,Refreshing and revealing,"I have studied the JFK assassination for close to 10 years, and originally believed the conspiracy fairy tales. However, reading Posner's book and visiting Dealey Plaza myself helped convince me Oswald was the lone assassin. I delighted to read Posner when he exposed the ""expert"" witnesses by referring to their endless contradictions. This book put a serious dent in the extremely profitable ""conspiracy"" business that the American public continues to buy."
1,Time For The Truth!,"I think whether you believe in the Conspiracy or not there has to be an official, above board re-investigation of the true facts in this case. Too much has been obscured for too long. And if our Government truly has faith in the initial findings of the Warren Commision, then they shouldn't fear a careful re-examination with input this time from the leading ""experts"" on the assasination (Groden, Lane, Lifton, Fetzer, et al--yeah, even this Posner guy.)Let's get to the Truth once and for all, and in THIS lifetime. For the memory of JFK and for us...""Ignorance is preferable to error;and he is less remote from the truth who believes nothing, than he who believes what is wrong"" Thomas Jefferson"
1,Posner is an absolute Joke!!!!!,"Posners joke of a book ignores so much evidence of a conspiracy its mind boggling.The Zapruder film absolutely proves that the fatal shot came from the fence behind the grassy knoll.Kennedys head goes back and to his left.He ignores pictures showing someone firing from behind the fence.Puffs of smoke in the air drifting off from the grassy knoll from the shots.People ducking for cover from the shot from behind the grassy knoll.Eyewitnesses that saw these murderers behind the same fence.Gerold Posner is a lying sack.Dont waste a penny on anything he touches.You want a book on the Kennedy assassination,get Crossfire(The plot that killed Kennedy)by Jim Marrs.Once again,this guy Posner is ridiculous.You will see what I mean when you see him on TV.You can literally see that he is a liar from his face.I cant believe Olbermann has this guy on his show sometimes."
1,Serious Case of Confirmation Bias,"It is extremely difficult to hit a target with a rifle so far away, even with a targeting scope. Now add to this that the target was moving. Add to this that there were trees in the way. Add to this the poor quality of the rifle. Add to this the stress a shooter would be under in such a situation. The head-shot knocked Kennedy's head back and to the left. Shards of flesh, skull and brain were blown backward and to the left, over the limo's trunk. Anyone who's been in combat, or who's fired a gun, knows that this is inconsistent with the bullet having come from the back."
1,Brilliant detective work,"Undoubtedly, Oswald acted alone. What other possibile explanation for a murder scene with 8 wounds in two men? It had to be one guy firing three shots, including several that missed. Congrats to Mr. Posner for this brilliant piece of _____."
1,THE COVER UP CONTINUES?,"The House Select Committee on Assassinations came to the conclusion in 1979 that there WAS a conspiracy. So much for Posner's insistence that Oswald was the lone assassin.OSWALD WAS ""SHEEP DIPPED""!!!Remember what Ruby said, ""Consequently, a whole new form of government is going to take over.""I'm amazed that apologists for the Warren commission still exist. The MAGIC BULLET, people!! This guy, Posner, works as a commentator for NBC. What does that tell you? I wouldn't be surprised if he's a Federalist. As Garrison said, ""The killers still possess the throne."" And apparently, they're still trying to cover it up.This book was written in reaction to Oliver Stone's masterpiece, JFK. Obviously those in power got worried. Read Garrison. Read some other research besides this. There's a plethora of it out there. Anything but this garbage. Or if you're too lazy to read, see JFK. There's more truth in 5 minutes of that film than in this whole smelly book. AMAZING!!CASE IS STILL OPEN!!!"
3,entry wound,"the wound in kennedy's neck is an entry wound, its as sipmle as that. thats the whole case."
1,Case definitely NOT closed,"Posner published this nearly 18 years ago as a slam on the lack of consensus among conspiracy buffs and a last-ditch defense of the Warren Commission. Yet by 1979 the US Government itself, in its HSCA hearings, already doubted the main conclusions of the Warren Commission: (a) that there were only three shots; and (b) that Oswald was the 'lone nut' shooter. In fact, the HSCA concluded that Oswald 'probably did not act alone.' So, Posner was already 14 years behind the times in 1993 when he advocated the US Government's obsolete position. Posner was probably attempting to influence the audience of Oliver Stone's 1991 movie, JFK, and I suppose he made some impact in the past 18 years, but not very much. If you really want to read something up-to-date on this topic, read HEAD-SHOT by G. Paul Chambers."
1,Horrible book,"A horrible book, a total sham, just like the Warren Report. Disorting testimonies and only posting what Posner thinks is good evidence. Please, do not buy this book and just read the Warren Report to know about the lunatic one-man Oswald theory. In fact, this book deserves less than 1 star even."
4,Cuts through the CRAP!!,Finally someone tries to answer questions with facts instead of fairy tales (pun intended) like Olliver Stone and a score of other conspiracy mongers have tried to do.If Posner hasn't uncovered an answer it probably won't be found. Very readable.
1,Fiction. BAD fiction.,"A poorly written, CIA-funded rehash of the WC. In other words, lies, lies, and more lies."
1,"Bill and Monica ""just good friends"" says Gerald Posner","Sirs,I wrote a review of this book at the start of August.It has not yet appeared.Could you give me some idea of when it will appear. Thank you for your help. Regards,John W.Lewis."
2,I would have liked more to read...,"I have been studying the Kennedy assassination for over 2 years, so I find it interesting to read books by people on both sides of the fence. Without saying if I agree or disagree with this book, I just didn't like it. If you took out all the times the author talked about what another author wrote and why they were wrong, I think this book would be a total of 10 pages long. When I read a book like this, I don't want to hear why everyone else is wrong and that you're right. I want you to present me with logical evidence and explain how it fits in. It also bothered me that all of the things the author accused other authors of doing (using selective parts of evidence or testimony) is exactly what he did.This book, like many other Kennedy books, was nothing more then a school yard argument. At the end of the book I sort of expected him to write ""nah ah, I'm right!"""
1,Don't Waste the Money,"I cannot believe that Mr. Posner found someone to publish this horrid excuse for a book. I'm not sure which is worse, his writing or his research. Thank God this man doesn't write history text books. If you don't care about details, truth, or facts, this book is perfect. It's only getting one star because there is no negative star choice."
1,"DID POSNER AND THE GANG, GET YOU, TOO?","I BOUGHT THIS BOOK TO PROVE THIS POINT...THE KING FAMILY AND JAMES RAY SAY:READ THE COURT RECORD AS PRESENTED IN THE TRIAL BY WILLIAM PEPPER. THE ESTABLISHMENT, MAINSTREAM-MEDIA WOULD HAVE YOU DISREGARD THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE KING FAMILY, BUT ACCEPT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE GOLDMANS...BELIEVE OJ WHEN HE TELLS YOU, ""IF I DID IT"", BUT DISREGARD THE CONFESSION (AFTER HIS ABANDONMENT BY HIS HANDLERS) OF JE RAY. GO FIGURE!?! EVERYBODY KNOWS,... THATS HOW IT GOES, EVERYBODY KNOWS!!!GET BACK @ ME"
3,Single Bullet Theory ? Please......,Anyone who believes that one bullet did all that damage to both Mr. COnnelly and President Kennedy and come out in prestine condition is completely out of touch with reality. Forensic science and bullestics have proven this theory false over and over again
1,Posner must have been on drugs,"I'm sorry, but to me, Posner seems to have made a conclusion many years ago and fit the facts into his conclusion.My guess is that he figured he could make money taking an approach that people would WANT to believe.I have never understood why so many people in the USA have suchhatred of federal government and dont want it to be involved in anything such as health care, welfare etc.BUT when it comes to the JFK assassination, they choose to believe the Feds and the Warren Report.Saying that Oswald was the lone killer is like saying Booth wasthe only one involved in Lincoln's assassination.Maybe Oswald did shoot JFK, but to say he alone was involved is ludicrous and unbelievably naive.To ignore the conviction that GARRISON obtained in New Orleans is inexcusable.Maybe in another 50 years we'll all get the real truth.PS and what is it with that Beard that Posner has??"
1,Ignorance Is Bliss,"If you love neuromuscular spasms that are faster than speeding bullets, or JFK's noble head made out of jet fuel for something called the jet effect, or bullets that disintegrate into a gazillion particles when striking skull, but break wrists that have a denser bone, clear out 4 inches of rib and come up well pristinely..magic....or a lone nut commie whose best friends are Kennedy hatin' ultra right winger holdovers from the Bay Of Pigs fiasco, when he's down in the big easy, or a load of White Russian Oil Geologists when living in Dallas/Ft. Worth.. this book is right up your alley ........"
1,Enter the Plagiarist,"I originally purchased this book to see if it could resolve some of the contradictory evidence that exists in various writings on the Kennedy Assassination. I was aware of its critics and the fact that several witnesses and sources cited in the book claim not to have given information to Posner. I found that the book omitted many key and controversial issues entirely, and I concluded that it was written as an advocacy statement, not as investigative journalism. I mentally rated it at about two stars. Now that Posner has been repeatedly cited for plagiarism in several books he has written subsequent to Case Closed, and also now seems to think it is funny that he was caught at it, I realize this book has NO value at all. I am surprised that the Amazon author bio does not mention the plagiarism scandal at all. How are readers to be expected to credit ""investigative journalism"" by an author without any ethics?"
4,"A good, clear look at the known facts","Let's face it... NOTHING will ever sway hardcore ""Lone Gunman"" or ""Conspiracy"" proponents on this topic. However, Posner's concise and lucid work here is big 'ol brick on the Oswald-Did-It side of the scale.The great strength of this book is that it approaches the assassination with a very straight-forward ""CSI"" approach (darn prescient of Posner a decade-plus ago) and comes up with some darn good explanations as to why that great Warren Commission chestnut, the Single-Bullet theory, holds up under real scrutiny. Thorburn's position. Bullet deformation v. velocity. Alignment of passengers in the car. Connelly's delayed reaction. Even the infamous ""back and to the left"" motion. Read Posner's book and all those things will have very plausible explanations.Whether you choose to accept or reject them is your call. But this book certainly does its part--perhaps more than any other written to date--to give you something very specific to accept or reject.-- mm"
2,Avoid! Major Quality Decrease,"Ive always loved the Earth Therapeutics hydro sponges. They really were top notch, and possibly they still are but not in this 12 pack. They are the opposite of plush, the material is just lacking. Honestly the ones I got from the dollar store are better. The handle, which is made from the same material as the loofa itself, is smaller than usual. All in all its just not that great of a product. Maybe in the 3 pack they are still plush, but not this pack. So look for something else."
1,This book is a fake!,"Check out the word-for-word similarity with this book and ""The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries"" by Evans-Wentz, or ""Earthlight"" by RJ Stewart. And what's even worse is that these and many other authors are not even credited in the book! The author presents this material as her own."
1,"""Real"" Faery-Faith this is not!","If there is any realism in this book (see review from 'midwest'), it's due to the fact that most if not ALL of the material in this book belongs to several other authors! Wake up!, do the reasearch and check it out for yourself, you'll be amazed. (RJ Stewart at least has integrity and original insights)"
1,A disgrace,"Do not, repeat, do not, waste your time withthis one. Nothing but a bunch of inaccurately (and pompously) regurgitated pablum. A shameand disgrace to the ways of Ireland and Faery that it purports to teach."
1,While I do use the first I avoid this one,"While I enjoy and use the first book as a reference item I did not enjoy this book at all. The use of Shamanic and Faery Wicca within a book just boggles my mind. As they are two different practices. I DO NOT recommend someone to use this book..There are far better books out there that deal with ""true shamanism"" without mixing it with wicca."
2,Cumbersome and a Little Boring,"Ignore all historical claims in this book. Many of them are poorly researched. Some of them are just plain made up. Putting that aside for a moment, the book wouldn't be that bad if it were a little more clear and a little less cumbersome. Quite frankly, this book is simply boring. There is some value (not historical value) in the teachings presented here, but they're not presented very well. If you have a great deal of patience and don't mind deciphering the message the author is attempting to convey, you might get something out of this book (provided you can ignore the glaring historical inaccuracies). Otherwise, skip it and move on to something else."
5,A wonderful book!!!,"Below it is mentioned that this Author has taken her writings qwithout credit being given to other Authors and they listed the books! Well, I wonw all of these books and in the back of this fantastic book the credits are indeed listed! Look at the credits you will see them! So, the borrowed words are credited and the rest is highly original and wonderful1 A must have! Buy it, you'll love it!!"
1,STINKS!,"Pompous in tone, this is newly invented 'Celtic Shamanism'......the Old Ones, the Shining Ones of Ireland would never recognize it......................."
1,Deserves a -5,"Complete fluff-bunny. Do not waste your time on this. Get Evans-Wentz, Caitlin Matthews or RJ Stewart. Deserves a -5."
5,Nancy Drew,"Great reading for girls of all ages. Written years ago in a simpler time, it's a great way to introduce younger readers to the the gift of reading. And it's also a fun read for those who read them as kids."
3,Too Sparce for such a BIG Subject,"I am sorry there wasn't so much more, like at least four CD's.There is only ONE CD.I feel cheated.Do it right please...give us more."
4,Phantom of Soho is above average,"I really like this movie, as I am into the Edgar Bryan Wallace mystery movies, all full of atmosphere. A who done it - certain people are being killed & Scotland Yard is called to find out why they are being killed and who is doing the killing. Surprise climax & a the murderer wears a creepy mask, held off until the end which adds suspense at least to me. It is is a low budget, but above average to me. I get into the atmospheric settings and just relax and enjoy.Alpha Videos' DVD has an ok widescreen transfer of it/blurry faded, but Retromedia has released a cleaner widescreen transfer of it. It is also available in some German box set totally remastered in German language with no English subs to follow along. The sets are expensive & Im perfectly happy with the versions the USA has put out - they suit me fine :)"
3,"Handy, but watch out for your tire bead","I used this product on an IRC Lover's Soul tire, a decent quality, low-pressure 26"" tire for city and street riding. Although the Quik Stik popped the tire off the rim very easily, it mangled the bead. The Quik Stik did make short work of taking the tire off, so I am not opposed to trying the lever on a tire with a different stye bead, however, if you have an expensive set of tires, I would proceed with marked caution."
5,Nice craft idea,"The loom is made of metal and very sturdy, and so are the metal and plastic hooks that come with it. The instructions contain good step-by-step drawings of what to do, and a few ideas of what else to make besides potholders. The package contains enough starter loops to make 2 potholders. The loops are new material and sized exactly for the loom (unlike some of the cheaper ones I have found in craft stores). However, the loops do have a few dangling strings that you might need to cut off if they stick out once the potholder is made."
4,Pretty Good at That Price,"In general, I'm fairly pleased with this purchase. I had no issues with the reseller (JTV Watches) or the timeliness of delivery.The watch looks great and functions well so far. I was surprised to find that it feels a little `cheaper' overall than an equivalently priced Seiko. Nonetheless, it still feels in-line with the price-point."
4,Dang Nice Watch,"Wonderful watch! Happy with the quality and how fast it got here. Absolutely nothing wrong with it. Face is perfect, no scratches or anything out of the ordinary. Comes with the manual on how to work it.The BEST LOOKING and BEST WORKING watch i've ever bought."
1,pulls hair out!,I got this for my man for xmas and after letting the thing charge he used it once and said it was removing the hair my mostly PULLING IT OUT! Now I've got to find a replacement shaver. I got this cause it had five stars WTH? I give it one star.
4,Don't Belevie all that you read in papers,"I thought that this movie was very original. I mean how many movies do you see about people serving others. It was also very funny.I coulnd't stop laughing through most of it. However some papers thought that this movie was pointless, unoriginal, and not funny. Now I'm noy saying take my word over others, but if you base what moive you are going to see over reviws. Then look at a lot fo reveiws not just one."
2,"Bad acting, plot and silly in some parts","This was not a good movie at all. And I bought this DVD and watched it. The acting is sorry, the plot is horrible and Matthew Perry looked absolutely silly in this movie. Elizbeth Hurley doesn't help anything to this movie either. There are some funny scenes, but only one or two. Hollywood can make these richly produced movies, yet there's always one dumb, throwaway movie popping up within the mix at the multiplex. Just avoid this movie!"
3,"Two Starring Actors, 100-mins. of Antics","Joe the Process Server (Matthew Perry) has just ""served Sara"" (Elizabeth Hurley) with divorce papers in New York. Sara's 2-timing Texas husband (Bruce Campbell) is trying to cheat her out of her rightful settlement as well as sell off an entire company that belongs to her. Joe has a change of heart (he's bribed actually) and decides to help Sara serve her husband first, in Texas. Together, Joe and Sara begin a wild trip across the country.This was just a cute story, but if you're a Hurley or Perry fan like I am, you'll enjoy their 100-mins. of antics."
1,Sorry Sara,This is not Matthew Perry finest hour. The storyline is very weak and the laughs passable. If it wasn't for Cedric the Entertainer and the character that plays Tony. This review would get no stars. Elizabeth Hurley role was flaccid and weak . I agree with the others Whole Nine Yards was Matthew Perry best.
1,Wait for HBO/tv!,"Matthew Perry + Elizabeth Hurley + Cedric The Entertainer + Vincent Pastore + Bruce Campbell = this dreck? This is one of the few times that I agree with the critics in that Mr. Perry (who looks like he was having some personal problems at the time of the filming) and Elizabeth Hurley simply do not show enough chemistry to save this sludge. As usual, the cast is game, but the writing and directing is simply not there. So, what gives the movie the 1 star? Hurley's outfits, for sure and Cedric The Entertainer, and the always sublime Bruce Campbell."
2,Funny with boring story...,"Joe Tyler (Matthew Perry) serves a surprised Sara Moore (Elizabeth Hurley) her divorce papers from her husband who attempts to seek benefits from the divorce laws in Texas. Sara convinces Joe to serve her husband divorce papers instead and this leads the two out on an adventure to try to find her husband in the state of Texas. Serving Sara is a comedy that has many belly aching moments, but these are based on situational jokes and pranks that seem irrelevant to the story, which leaves the viewer with an unsatisfied film happening."
2,Barely Entertaining,"I almost always finish a movie...but I actually had to watch this one over 3 days since I thought it was so horrendous. Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley have absolutely NO chemistry. It makes me feel awkward to watch them together. They seem so forced and uncomfortable. This movie has 1-2 decent chuckles...other than that, I kept asking myself how a promising idea and decent actors could turn out so poorly."
3,Sings the movies...,"The only confusing thing about this album is the title. There are 2 CD's in the market titled ""Shirley Bassey Sings The Movies"". This one includes new recordings from some of the best songs from famous motion pictures.Shirley pours all her grandeur and feelings in the songs but the orchestrations are just too unbearable. Shirley is a first rate performer and her voice is larger than life. The album sounds like a Low Budget recording, just like the sounds on ""The Power Of Love"" album. WHY?I still prefer the other ""Sings the Movies"" collection where she sings classic theme songs, and of course ""Goldfinger"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"" are included.The ""Goldfinger"" version on this record is simply less dynamic than the original."
2,Stupid brush,I hate this eyeliner! I used the other Maybelline Liquid Eyeliner in the cone bottle and it was perfect but since they discontinued that I turned to this. The brush is not the felt tip like the other one but rather a thin bristle brush so it was very hard to apply. I had to re-dip a few times just for a thin line. The quality is just not the same. I ended up throwing the bottle away after 2 uses.
1,Poor Quality,"As far as the supplier is concerned, I received this item promptly and without any hassles. But the massager itself never worked. It broke while trying to install the batteries. It appears that the battery compartment is actually too small, and the massager would not close with the batteries in place. Because the price was so low, I decided against trying to get an exchange or refund. I thought the shipping cost would basically eat it up, and a replacement unit would probably have the same trouble. I rate the supplier 5 stars, but no stars for the massager (one star was required, but not deserved). And I strongly recommend NOT buying this item."
3,Some flaws . . .,"Yoga for runners is important because inflexibility for runners means injuries. Although the series of moves is useful, I find myself distracted by three flaws in the video. Little warm-up precedes the quick, strenuous moves. The sound quality in few places is poor. Most annoying, at the end, Thom disappears right before Birch leads a relaxation segment. I'm supposed to be relaxing and find myself wondering where he had to go. Everything else is done professionally and well, so these flaws mystify me and, unfortunately, distract me."
2,Disappointed. Moves too fast,"The instruction on this video is too fast. There is no time to properly get on pose before it goes to the next move. Also, the voice is not coordinated and lags behind the demonstration."
3,Mmmhh.... good,"This book is more a series of tips that a book that guides you through a complete ""system"" or ""way of playing"". Don't get me wrong, it contains a lot of useful tips, but they don't seem to be arranged into a logic secuence.I find it useful if you already know what are the flaws in your game, and could provide you with some interensting exercices for improving.Overall a fairly good book, but not the best out there..."
4,Unusual Electronic Experimental,"Quite honestly, I do not have anything for which to draw a comparison from. I will say that the music on this CD is performed and written by some heavy, musically introspective, musicians. As I listened, I traveled through many different ebbs & flows. Now I am sounding really generic and ZGA is anything but generic! If you are unfamiliar with this band, they record on the ReR label, which is Chris Cutler's company. Think Autechre runs head long into an electric guitar with the odvious percussion swept away out-there-somewhere! I really have not heard this enough yet to say anything more. For now, called it an adventerous spin!"
5,Extraordinary,"I am a great fan of Mr. Rehak. I have read all of his books, and he has not disappointed me yet. It is obvious from reading the book that Mr. Rehak did a considerable amount of research. But, what sets this book apart from the others that have been written about Lizzie is the ""extra step"" that Mr. Rehak takes in making the story all his with that glorious story telling that he weaves into all his books. He is a very talented writer with a wonderful sense of humor. I am looking forward to his next book. (Yes, I think Lizzie did it.)"
3,Good knife,"Mundial 5100 Series 10-inch Slicer with Granton Edge is a good knife. It's still new so it is razor sharp as one would expect. This knife is NOT fully forged as most of the other Mundial 5100 Series knives- the blade is rather thin and light weight. Also, the handle feels small to me.Only time will tell if this was a worthwhile purchase."
3,Teen flick,"This is your basic teen flick: lots of car chases, bombs, violence, torture, and a sloppy ending. The plot is extremely complex; I'm not sure anyone could make basic sense out of it. And the hospital escape scenes are among the most fanciful in screen history. Fanciful as in ridiculous. Yes, the two superstars can certainly act. But both deserve to be in better movies."
5,Conspiracy Theory,"Super-action star Mel Gibson and well-known actress Julia Roberts star in an electrifying film from Warner Bros. and director Richard Donner. New York cab driver Jerry Fletcher (Gibson), an insane conspiracy-believer for years, has his worst nightmare and his long-time prediction come terrifyingly true when a conspiracy is discovered, in the middle of it all Jonas Fink (Patrick Stewart). This film is not only a suspenseful and action-packed adventure but a hilarious hit with unintended romance. Produced by Joel Silver (Lethal Weapon saga, Die Hard saga, The Last Boy Scout, Executive Decision)."
2,"Velly interesting, but shtoopid","I guess Mel Gibson had to pay rent on one of his expensive houses to play in this Manchurian Candidate for Dummies. The cinematography is muddy and the direction is a vacant lot of fast editing and stuff that explodes. Sure Mel Gibson is attractive, but he has yet to make a movie that proves he can act (with the exception of Road Warrior and the Year of Living Dangerously). This film exists in the cinema limbo between ""films so bad they are good"" and ""well made films."" It's like Lethal Weapon minus the focus, Cutthroat Island minus the effort, and Deep Impact minus the talent. Use that money and buy that Psychic TV CD you always wanted."
1,conspirsy theory,This item was to be nearly new it was in poor condition. The case was old. It was meant to be a Christmas present and I had to get another present instead.
1,RUINED BY THRILLER CLICHES,THIS FILM IS VERY ENTERTAINING BUT (LIKE LOTS OF THESE TYPE OF MOVIES) GETS RUINED BY THRILLER CLICHES. LEAVE OUT THE THRILLER CLICHES AND YOU HAVE A GREAT MOVIE.
2,conspire to get yr money,"this hokey movie with hollywoods high paid actors, shows ya..they are doing it for the money and nothing else.all the actors and support cast give card board performances in this supposed thriller....! don't waste your time or money"
5,Magnificently Brilliant,"Conspiracy Theroy is an action packed edge of your seat adventure that will keep you laughing, crying and thinking all the way to the end."
3,love these movie stars,Julia Roberts and Mel Gibson are dear faces to watch. The story lacks depth. It is not an interesting enough story.
4,Holds up well,"First saw this when it was released, then recently watched it, and it held up surprisingly well. Like most old movies, there's some bad lighting to wade through, and the plot pacing can be awkward and slow at times. But Mel's performance is still great, he plays this manic conspiracy-obsessed socially inept man very well. The plot is still compelling today, especially since the Tea Party has shifted our national conversation even farther towards conspiracy theories"
4,"In 2006, this film's arting to make sense...","I like this movie. I've seen it several times. One of my favorites. I actually wish there was a sequel. When this film first came out, I thought the Jerry character was a real wacko. Now, in December 2006, I think he's beginning to make some sense..."
5,Musta missed this one at the movies,"I would call it a sleeper in my books as I missed it on the big screen.HIGH intensity with great twist and turns throughout. I agree, the ending was kinda predictable but then again, I was in need of a break. I was kinda a waiting for yet another AHH HAA! But nope. It was good though. Put me in mind of the SQUEEZE with Micheal Keaton and Ray Dawn Chong... never heard of it? See what I mean! GREAT MOVIES await on VIDEO!"
1,"Conspiracy Theory, Allright","I would like to postulate a conspiracy theory of my own after watching this journey-ride through incompetent filmmaking. I firmly resolve that Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts could never have possibly decided to make a movie as ridiculous as this. They were impersonated by two cunning imposters who, in conspiracy with Hollywood renegades, have plotted to destroy their careers. At least that's what Gibson and Roberts SHOULD believe, considering that this movie sinks to greater depths than even ""The Man Without A Face"" or ""Dying Young."" Plotless, Thoughtless, and not to mention artless, ""Conspiracy Theory isn't even sophisticated enough to make true believers of the X-Files worshiping idiots that flocked to see it in the first place. In some sense, actually, ""Conspiracy Theory"" is one of the most important movies in the history of film, proving once and for all that cospiracy and paranoia centered movies have no future to entertain in our country. Please take note, Hollywood."
3,"Three-and-a-half stars. Mel's fourth best film, After...","The Patriot, The Passion of the Christ,and of course, Braveheart. Mel's crazycharacter Jerry in here is incorrect onseveral rambling points at the beginningog th film; Pres. George Herbert WalkerBush was NOT a 33rd degree Mason. He wasSkull and Bones at Yale U., like his fat-her and son, and grandfather! So was Algore,Bill Clinton and Marion G. 'Pat' Robertson(!), Jr. Also, the Vatican is no 'fester-ing scab' - that would be the Talmud! Atany rate, this film is a riveting ridethrough the real world of the MK Ultraproject and there may be many 'Jerry'saround the country - still! A very goodfilm, but at least TV prints edit 'Jerry'smaddening habit of taking the lord's namein vain! Julia Roberts finest performanceto date. Date? Yea, I'd take her out on adate...Or buy her some dates...Her choice!"
1,Previously views video,The video was advertised as unwrapped but never viewed and was found to have advanced beyond the beginning of the movie. The quality was poor. The seller refunded the price.
2,WHY WHY WHY,"Why Julie Roberts, Why. The only reason this movie gets 2 stars is because Gibson's performance is great."
1,Insulting,"Super dopey, I laughed out loud. So bad that it's hard to beleive it was made. Gibson, as usual, tries to make the insane seem cutesy and lovable and does a horrible job. Basically, he just mugs for the camera. I, Static and other den members spent days ripping up this one."
4,drifty spies?,"This is a ""used to be"" spy with a fear of conspiracies. He sees them everywhere. But this time is he right or not? Roberts adds the perfect touch to this movie. Buy it and see for yourself."
4,Conspiracies Un-numbered!!,"Is Jerry Fletcher the real thing, or is he suffering from brain-burnout from writing his monthly pamphlett on government conspiracies - only his typewriter knows for sure.This is a nice little romp down way-left-field lane, and Mel Gibson shines at playing characters on the very, very edge of reason.Julia Roberts is very good, revealing her long-suffering patience with Jerry. Patrick Stewart makes an indifferent bad-guy, he can't help it, the plot izzz somewhat goofy.The DVD transfer is excellent as usual! END"
3,You've seen this before but it is still enjoyable,"Mel Gibson's portrayal of the main character, Jerry, is the same act you have seen before in the Lethal Weapon series. The crazy, yet intelligent man who can get out of impossible situations can be monotonous after a while. Julia Roberts masters her role with much more originality, which saves the movie. There are several twists in the plot and a surprise ending that I will not give away, but you might be able to guess."
4,MEL O DRAMA ALMOST WORKS,"The charisma that Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts have developed over the years is the saving grace of this convoluted, overly plotted movie. Written by Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential, Mystic River, A Knight's Tale), it tells the story of a conspiracy obsessed cabbie (Gibson) who finally stumbled onto a conspiracy that involves his unrequited love (Roberts). Heading up the bad guys is X-Men's Patrick Stewart, who gives a solid performance as Dr. Jonas/Henry Finch.the movie seemed a little too long, and some middle sags deleted some of the suspense. Gibson performs admirably, although it's just a little bit more of the Lethal Weapon personna unharnessed. Roberts is not a great actress (in spite of Erin Brockovich), but she is a great presence, and Donner films her with all the right lights and angles to enhance this. Someone like Laura Linney would have made the role much more memorable.But as entertaining, if confusing, fluff, CONSPIRACY THEORY is a fun movie to watch."
5,Mel Gibson's best role,"I saw this on cable and now have to get it on DVD. It is a very disturbing, powerful film with Mel really off showing his acting skills as a believable paranoid sinking deeper and deeper.The viewer really gets drawn into the inner workings of the afflicted personality. On top of that it is quite scary story. If you liked ""The Game"" you will like this..."
4,Relaxing....,I especially enjoy the music early in the morning as I have my first cup of coffee. Great way to start the day.
5,Sounds like a music box,"I always love Gary Stadler's music anyway, but this 'Fairy Lullabies' is gorgeous, (no real surprise). I told my Aunt about it, and she had to go buy one too.I listen to it every night. It's a beautiful relaxing Cd. The first song, does have some sounds in the background that I don't think are suppose to be there. Maybe it's just my tape. It's gorgeous, and I just bought another one for a little girl who has been going through alot. Thank-you Mr. Stadler, it's perfect!"
2,"maybelline lip polish, nude flash","the price is outrageous compared to all lip polishes, this is the only one high priced, and, i do love this one..."
5,I wish my son would stop asking for Peter's Trucks...,"I renewed this book from the library so often that I bought our own copy. The clincher was watching my 28-month old sit on the floor and turn each page, reciting all the lines. The reviews don't do justice to this charming story with fun illustrations."
2,Almost a Great Book...,"We almost liked this book. The pictures are large and friendly and attractive, and there are alot of interesting things to point out and talk about; but unlike the children of the other reviewers, mine did not find this book engrossing.I think the principle reason for this is the rhyme. We read alot of poetry (son and daughter, 3 and 5 respectively) and I think the not quite free-verse style of this author threw them off.For example, at one point the rhyming words are ... bank/yank...sack/back...(so far, okay)... and then truck/money. Hmmm.I am going to try to overcome this by just leaving off the last two lines of every paragraph (the truck/money part) and see how it goes. Other than that it is a delightful book.Just thought you'd like to know."
4,Great series of books.,"As a manager going through grad school, having these series of quick reading help books has been my saving grace in school and on the job."
3,very easy puzzles,"if you're an experienced x-word solver like me, you'll find these puzzles ridiculously easy. if you have only some experience, they may present you with a bit of a challenge, but i was totally bored. sigh."
2,Poor proof-reading undermines this book's value.,"This pass key could benefit from a more careful locksmith. Multiple proof-reading errors_in questions, answer keys and solution explanations_made studying with this book almost as challenging as taking the test."
1,Don't waste $0.01 on a used copy as I did,"This book is written by a very self-absorbed man with an extremely protracted adolescence. He wanders the earth backpacking a la 70's style looking for himelf and the answers of the world on this jouney. He has many affairs on the way, impregnates a woman, while a wife is left back at home in a mental institution all during the jouney.Apparently he proposes that he found all the answers he seeked at the end of the book---he converts from Judaism to Christianity. Although he didn't seem to really have much understanding about Judaism at the start. I don't get how he arrives at this conversion, he waxes on so poetically, as the beatnick poet he imagines his life to be. And I am convinced he's just as messed up at the end of the book(where he claims he's found Jesus and the answers to his great quest) as he was in the beginning. Or more so.It disgusted me as a Jew that some guy---a selfish loser--- treats it all so poorly. And takes himself this seriously."
4,"It's Time to Watch, my friends!","This movie is superb. Just peachy. And I'm not being sarcastic. This film depicts the prejudice and discrimination which unforunately still lingers in today's society. Carl Lee Haley (Sammy L Jackson, one good actor) openfires on two rednecks who rape and nearly kill his ten year old daughter, and so faces the wrath of his Southern peers on trial. A big plus in this one is Matty McConaughey, which I have only three words for: HOT HOT HOT! In my opinion, his presence justifies going out and at least renting this flick. So what time is it? A time to go out and see A Time to Kill? You betcha!"
4,Great Movie,"While I enjoyed the movie very much, I was troubled with the theme. Most fathers feel just like the character portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, but that does not make it right to murder another person. If we tolerate murder for one thing most agree with, pretty soon it will be allowed for many other things.Sandra Bullock, Samuel L. Jackson and Matthew McConaughey delivered great performances and the movie is very good. This was not too far from the condition of many southern cities in the 50's & 60's, but not today. Any movie that entertains and makes you think is worth the time spent watching it.I highly recommend this movie and know I will watch it again."
4,A time to kill blu ray,Good item arrived on time Was in very good condition no issues. Excellent movie can watch it many times the story is really good and blu ray special items
3,My review?,"I've seen maybe 40 minutes of To Kill A Mockingbird, and those 40 minutes were WAY better than the 2+ hours needed to view this film.This movie basically glorifies revenge killing. That's it in a nutshell. And the ""insanity"" plea is so hard to get a jury to believe (ask all the women who kill their children), so you know this is straight Hollywood.And this is coming from someone who saw this movie when it first came out (I was thirteen), but now that I'm older, I see how many flaws and how incredulous it really is. The ""now imagine she's white"" speech was so unbelievably ridiculous that Jake should have been reported to the bar. The trial wasn't about the RAPE, it was about what Sammy L's character did AFTER the rape...so by this movie's logic...if the girl was white, it would have been automatically acceptable for the father to kill the offenders. yeah freakin right."
1,Martin Luther King would join KKK after watching this !!!,"Close your eyes and imagine have KKK doesn't oppose with violance court's decision to free Afro-American from charges of killing two white people. Now imagine how Afro-American plans and kills two white idiots and then cries to his lawyer that he mut stay away from proison so he could support his family. Is it enough ? In short, ridicilous nonsense."
2,Movie is 5 Star DVD is a Flipper!,Movie is awesome but having to get up and turn the disc over to finish watching is a total bummer. Wait until it is rereleased with proper encoding.
2,A highly unsatisfactory courtroom drama,"Any suggestion from the reviewers below, that this film provides inspiring justice is false. The message that A Time to Kill sends out is that vigilante action if fine, as long as it is done by blacks and not whites, as McConaughey's mawkish final speeches shows. I'm NOT a racist, but from my own studies of law at school and indeed from the dialogue in the film, the Jackson character was guilty of manslaughter at the very least as he was not insane. The rest is wash of stereotypes and VERY thin, very predictable plotting that is dragged out far too long. The acting is the best thing it, with , McConaughey, Spacey and Bullock mking the most of their stereotyped characters. McConaughey: young idealistic lawyer, Spacey: snaky D.A. with political ambitions and Donald Sutherland is wasted as a grizzled veteran lawyer who does absolutely nothing. An overrated movie."
2,Time to Kill the Flipper,This a fantastic movie. The adaptation from the book is one of the best from Grisham's novels. But this DVD edition is a Flipper. Some day the DVD companies will realize that DVD collectors don't want to have to get up and flip the disc over in order to watch the second half of the film. I'll stick to VHS on this one.
3,ok,"it came in a about a weekit plays good, but it skips on some parts , which really makes me mad. I mean its not to bad, but not 5 stars"
2,review of A Time to Kill DVD,DVD itself was in good condition but case was smashed in the corner. Tried sending back for a new one but have not heard back from distributer. Haven't received any reply to the email I sent either.
4,One of John Grisham's Best,"A young black girl is brutally raped and left for dead by two drunken white teens. But this is the south, and will justice be done? The girl's father does not think so, and in a fit of passion blows the two away right in the courthouse.No lawyer in his right mind would try to defend him, right? But someone has to do it; he's entitled to a defense. So an idealistic young white lawyer is appointed, and with the help of his aging alcoholic mentor, they set to work to provide a defense for the grieving father. Of course politics, religion and the KKK all get involved.Sounds all rather straightforward, but John Grisham does not write that way. He throws in enough curves to keep everyone guessing, and I'll play fair and not tell you the outcome. You will have more fun watching it unfold that way. Four stars, for sure."
4,A good thought provoking movie,"Being from Mississippi and my mother having been raised in Canton, where this was filmed, I was specially interested in seeing how my state was portayed. I also wanted to see my uncle who was an extra in the last funeral scene (but you can only see him in slow motion as they walk out of the house). The film mostly offers a view of a few prejudiced idiots. Sadly, there are people like this in our state. Actually, these days more folks are like Jake than are like the klansmen shown. The movie was great!! Just don't think we are all against persons who are different from ourselves."
1,Did not work - TWICE,I received this video twice and both times I could not navigate throuch options. The first movie started in the middle when I put it in and it wouldn't rewind. The second movie cut off 3/4 of the way through and I could not get past it.
1,...bad movie...this is a bootleg tape..,"I purchased it from Amazon.com and Walmart...it stops 1 hour and 14 minutes...then it goes away...the FBI is looking for these sellers who are breaking the law by selling ""bootleg"" versions...copyright infringment...pls report them to DHS, ICE, FTC, FBI, and local authorities..."
5,A time to kill,"The theme of this movie is that of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" with a modern setting and a guilty but justified twist. Wanted it for my Library."
3,A Time to Kill,I really enjoyed the movie; but the book is always better. The stars were terrific. I am so happy I have this movie in my library.
5,Best Movie Ever Made,"This is one of the best movies ever made. It is so powerful, it gives me a chill every time I see it, especially the last scene in the court room. This movie could be set in our times too, as racism is still going on today. This movie should be on everyone's ""must-see"" list!I can only highly recommend it!!!!"
4,Excellent Movie,"Every thing about this movie is Excellent; the acting, the storyline, the emotion. Set in a small town where racism is prevalent, Samuel L's daughter is raped and beaten by two red-neck bad boys. Sam takes the law into his own hands and Matt is tasked with defending him pro-bono. Excellent subplots. The movie keeps you guessing as to whether he'll be found innocent or guilty."
4,Great Flick,Excellent movie with an thorough overview of the true nature of the American Legal System. Excellent for college students who didn't pay attention in class during high school government and history.
4,A Time to Kill,I was enjoying the movie when about 2/3's of the way through the movie would no longer play. No matter what I tried it would not go passed that point on the disc. Since I can't return it because I opened it thank God I read the book so I know the ending.
2,"Good movie, terrible DVD","Let me say first that I really like this movie. It's entertaining and I like the casting. But the DVD is horrible and beyond cheesy. I bought it to replace a VHS copy. Forget ""special"" features - this DVD doesn't even have STANDARD features! About 1 hour and 15 minutes into the movie, it stops and YOU HAVE TO FLIP IT OVER! You've got to be kidding me! The ""scene access"" is poor, too. You can't jump to scene 3 if you want to - you can only skip to specific scenes: 5, 10, 15, etc. Finally, and this is minor but only proves a point, the case is cheap. It's not encased in plastic, it's just cardboard. Save your money and don't buy this DVD."
3,The best courtroom drama I have ever seen!,"This is the best courtroom drama I have ever seen! Even though I did not see A TIME TO KILL theatrically, one night, it was October 30, 1999, it happened to be on ABC, so, I decided to watch it. After watching it then, I decided I liked it and wanted to own it. This smashing courtroom drama REALLY made me feel good, and the more I watch it, the more I like it. If you ask me, Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) gave Billy Ray (Nicky Katt) and Pete (Doug Hutchison) what they deserved. I thought that Ellen (Sandra Bullock) looked especially beautiful in the black dress coat and skirt, white blouse, and black high heels. I have quite a bit of the dialogue memorized. Having said all that, I give A TIME TO KILL three out of four stars."
3,"Great movie, not so great disc.",So WHY was this a flipper disk? The movie isn't THAT long that you should have to turn the disk over to finish watching it.
4,Intense Movie!,I love the actors in this film and their portrayal of each character brings them to life.
3,I like this movie but...,The DVD has NO extra features AND you have to turn the disc over to watch the second half of the movie.
4,GREAT FILM NEEDS A BETTER DVD TREAMENT!,"This is a really good film. I'm a sucker for a good court room drama and if you add the vigilante aspect you got me lock stock and barrel! Great performances and a well written script, but some shmuck decided to make a cheesy disc flipper with this movie! I deduct one star for the fact I have to be interrupted in the middle of this movie to flip the disc! Boo!This film deserves better!"
5,A Time to Kill,If you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you. It really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause.
3,A Time to Kill,"Excellent movie, we enjoyed it very much, loved the cast and probably can't add anything useful to the other positive reviews. One significant and entirely inexplicable feature stands out re this film and another Grisham, the ""Pelican Brief:"" Why on earth is the movie separated into two parts, with half on each side of a DVD???? DVD's are supposed to be an improvement in medium over videotape, but it's far more convenient and much more pleasurable to watch the videos of these two films, given that there is no need to scrutinize the movie beforehand to see which side to play first, and no necessity to get up mid-movie and flip the ?!@!! thing over. Who's nutty idea was this? I truly hope he/she has moved on to honest work outside the entertainment industry."
3,Your basic Hollywood racism film,"Based on the best-selling novel by John Grisham, who knows how to please Hollywood, A Time To Kill is so predictably cast with the white guys as racist, drunken, lazy or just plain stupid. The white, beautiful girl as smart, tough and not interested in money... (HA)The jury is chock full of White people who don't care and their bad because their white. Because their white, their racist, thus again....their bad.The Black folks are poor and live in depravity, except where Samuel Jackson got the money to buy that rifle, Lord only knows? It would be more realistic if he came out with an old pump action shotgun.Grisham had a chance to sling mud at the Christian church too, depicting the preacher as a man easily influenced by greed."
3,A good film but not as good as what it could be,"Comment to Matthew Stelly, you need to calm down, its just a film. Its obvious you have differnt views about the movie. It is ok to be a critic, but you are criticizing the film for the wrong reasons. This movie is race related yes I can see that, but you are making it out to be an excuse for whites coming to the rescue to an African American. You make it sound like this movie is a cover up to slavery. You need to stop dwelling upon the past and get your head straight. Yes racism still exist today, but it exist on both sides of the fence. The days of slavery are over. God created every man equal. People make mistakes, but dont punish the people who are here now that cant do anything about what their ancestors did. That is wrong and very narrow minded. I hope you get your head straight. As far as the film goes it could have been better."
4,Beautiful Doll.,"Received doll promptly-- shipping was great. However, the box the doll was in was very dirty. I had to wipe it down with a damp cloth before I could wrap it as a Christmas gift. Doll was very pretty and seemed like a very durable item."
2,The book starts off fine but . . .,Atomic Candy does a great job of placing the reader in the middle of many important cultural events in the post-WWII era but does nothing beyond that. The book disintegrates into a ho-hum story of a woman trying to find some purpose in life and concludes with a puzzling encounter with Richard Nixon. I finished reading this book on a trip and spent the entire ride back trying to figure out what exactly the point of the story was. I'm still scratching my head.
3,bought this with confetti jump ropes...,"...in order to get super saver shipping...wasn't worth the savings...would have been the same price, roughly. Not a bad book of jingles, mind you, but all reminded my 8-year old daughter of school (which isn't what she wanted to do while jumping). Pretty good idea if the school used it to teach planets, etc., but i don't think that kids want that. They probably want easier things to yell while they are jumping than trying to learn at the same time. But I tried it because my girl is pretty darn smart. Thought she might think it would be for the rhythm rather than to learn, so that's why 3 stars."
5,viva les messyheads!,"You'll like this if your tastes run to: big star, black rebel motorcycle club, nick cave, hives, jesus & mary chain, vines, guided by voices, radiohead, iggy pop, teenage fanclub, coldplay, ramones, replacements, scott walker, foo fighters, paul westerberg, D4, rolling stones, bright eyes, johnny thunders - yeah it's that diverse!"
4,Twenty-four B&W photos of the early art of Mexico,"When we think of the people of early Mexico, our thoughts naturally turn to great pyramids and brutal sacrifices. People were ritually killed to satisfy their gods for reasons that we really do not understand. However, like all civilizations, the early Mexicans produced works of art. This book is a collection of photos of 24 pieces of art from the earliest time of civilization in Mexico. The figures are of distorted humans, where it is clear that the distortion was deliberate in order to emphasize certain characteristics.If you have an interest in the early art of Mexico, then this book is a good place to start."
3,Sharks & Little Fish,"Faithful B&W adaptation of WWII German naval memoir, typical period ennui, interesting comparison to Das Boot. Worth a look. Enjoy!"
2,REGURGITATION FOR LONG-TIME FANS,"I was hoping for more unusual cuts than just the B-sides I collected in the 80's. It is good for the Ultravox completists, but better packaging with info on these tracks would have been nice. I'll skip the second volume, which I have heard is worse."
5,Good valve,"This is definitely a top-quality ball valve, as plastic valves go. Much better than what I could find in the big box stores. I expect this to last and stay leakproof for a long time."
2,Spy Kids2: The Island of Stupidity,"This movie stinks!! It has a stupid plot and effects that look like they're from the 50's!! Also, the movie is so cheesy, it attracts rats!! Be safe and see agent cody banks which is much better!!"
4,"Spy Kids 2, better that the 1st","As a teenager I usually don't have a thing for movies like this but I definetly liked this one. I ended up taking my little sister to see it but I ended up liking it more than her. Yes, some parts are cheesy (like when the little spy boy ballet dances with the presidents daughter), but there aren't that many moments like that. They also have 2 new characters. Gerti (who is played by Haley Joel Osments sister) is a cool gal and her brother Gary (Matt O'Leary) is gorgeous! I think that's why I liked the movie so much. He's a great actor and a major hottie! The movie itself is WAY better that the first too. The islands got some cool animals too, the ""catfish"" is cute but i found the ""spider monkey"" a little disturbing looking. If that thing was my pet I'd be a little scared! I don't want to give the movie away but DEFINETLY WATCH IT!"
1,"Can't give a review, there was no movie inside the case.","This order was done in Sept 2011, but we had continued to forget to take it to the little girl we boought it for and so it had never been opened. Finally this weekend, Feb 25, 2012 we took it to the child and I just received a text from the family saying there was no dvd in the package. It was sealed, and bought directly from Amazon. I feel bad that the 10 y,o, excitedly opened it up to watch it--- to find an empty case. That was kind of expensive for an empty movie case :(Only gave it one star, because there was no movie"
3,Same old same old,Very similar to the other movies - same old story. My kids of course were entertained which is the point.
4,another winner,Thanks for coming back for a second one. both my son and I enjoy all of these spy kids movies. Watching these kids grow into grown up actors is so much fun.
4,The boys loved it :-),Our grandsons were so excited to see this movie and were so looking forward to it's release on Tuesday. They weren't disappointed. I'm so thankful to be able to order new releases on Amazon. Great family movie.
4,The Adventure contunues....,"The first time I ever saw this series was on a long flight with my young Daughters, 3 & 6. It was the 3rd one and I hated it. Now I live watching these with them. The Second one, The Island of Lost Dreams is as good as the first, if not better. With a great supporting cast, Antonio Bandaras, Steve Buscemi, and Ricardo Montalban, how can they go wrong. My Kids loved it as well as I did."
4,Enjoyable,My 5 year old daughter enjoys this movie. I prefer Spy Kids 1 but she likes them both the same.
4,Excellent fun!,"The movie was entertaining and my grandchildren were excited to watch it. It held their attention (ages 8, 6 and 4) and they seemed to enjoy the outcome. Made them want to see the next movie...Spy Kids 3."
1,NO PLOT AT ALL!,This movie had a poor script and in my opinion it had no feasable plot. It really needed more than Carmans crush on Gary Giggles and the fact that his father wants to take over the world. Compared to the first movie this movie was horrible. And at the end they sort of try to make Carman (Alexa Vega) into a pop star singer that really ticked me off. that is why i give it 1 star (really i don't think it deserves any). I really wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone who really enjoyed the first one.
4,A Fun & Exciting Film,"Spy Kids has awakened the child inside me, due to the good inocent humor and cartoonish, non-lethal family film.The director Robert Rodriguez has shown one more time his creativity and good humor.Antonio Banderas has proved that he really is a good actor in kind of movie roles. Also Carla Gugino is fantastic in her role as a good mom who always takes good care of her family.Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara have grow up since their last movie. They have not, however, lost there inocence and are still cute.As the mother of two kids (from Los angeles), I would encourege you to add this movie to your colection."
3,Better,"Well, i saw the first and cried it was so bad, but they have made many improvements. i especially liked the ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Jason and the Argonauts"", and the ""Indiana Jones"" parodys. they also spent more time on the plot and not the Sibling rivalry [stuff]. i actually found myself enjoying it. I laughed out loud a couple times to. this is much better than the first and i reccomend this over it. the only reason to see the first is if you, like me, are a ""I gotta see um in order"" kinda person.all in all, a huge improvement. if the 3rd is as better as the second to the first, the 3rd will [be great]"
5,Great HD Movie excellently cast,"The first thing I noticed when watching the movie was the excellent picture quality - it was 'filmed' in High Definition.Apart from really enjoying the movie (I haven't seen Spy Kids 1 or 3), I found the audio commentary by Robert Rodriguez fantastic. So much so, I plan on buying the DVD, just so I can listen to this again (I borrowed the DVD from our local library).What a talented and imaginative man Robert Rodriguez is. I also found that alot of his comments are also appropriate in many other areas of ones life, and they don't only relate to the movie industry.The DVD contains a lot of extra special features and I found them most interesting.In summary it was a really enjoyable movie, and the special features were superb."
2,Good for what it is,"Any movie with Christopher McDonald *and* Steve Buscemi gets at least a few points in my book.But seriously, Spy Kids 2 is not a bad movie. It's an unpretentious family flick, and it doesn't bog down at any point.However, while writer/director Richard Rodriguez has been receiving tons of praise for his accomplishment, he fails to do one very important thing in his movie: create any real suspense. The threats the Spy Kids run into are more momentary diversions and less life/mission-threatening terrors.Spy Kids also falls into the trap of over-reliance on computer graphics, which oftentimes serve to remind the viewer that it's only a movie.Still not an unenjoyable watch, though. Especially for kids."
1,Worse than the first,"And I thought that one was pretty awful. My kids loved the first one so I took them to this one - judging by thier reactions, they didn't like it as much either. The plot is lame, thin and a kid over 9 would agree that it is pretty silly to the point of stupidity. The special effects are by far and away the worst I have seen in a movie in a long time. My kids kept commenting ""that looks fake"". To say the least, they were awful, not one effect looked real in the least. The characters had even less development than the first and the acting, even the acting of relatively accomplished actors such as Banderas and Buschimi was strained and contrived. Very young children will enjoy seeing the Spy Kids again, parents should simply do themselves a favor and nap through this dog."
4,Great Movie,I enjoyed Spy Kids 2 a lot. I have Spy Kids and it was alright. I watched 3-D in theatres and thought it was crappy. Today I watched Spy Kids 2 and I loved it it's a funny movie full of action. I highly recommend it.
3,What a Ride,"As an adult I watched the first Spy Kids out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised. I thought I had heard the second one didn't do well at the theater, so I didn't go out of my way to rent it. I happened to catch it on cable the other day. I now am seriously thinking about buying it.I was again impressed with the great story, sets, and special effects. As far as I'm concerned if you have a good cast and they are having fun making a movie it has a decent chance of being entertaining. I think the adults had as much fun as the kids making this one. The movie never takes itself to seriously and that is definitely a good thing.Initially I was watching the movie by myself but after my wife heard me laughing out loud a few times she started watching. She was impressed as well on the movies merits. All I can say is if you want a movie the whole family can enjoy you should seriously consider this one."
4,"First one was better, sort of I","don't know, really. I'm so glad they casted Steve Buscemi, I love that actor! He's my favorite actor, and the Spy Kids series is no doubts one of my favorites! The casting is, just so.The first one is better, because Spy Kids is an idea were you can make 1, that's really good but 2 has sort of desperate attemps, then 3 is entertaning but sort of dry, then no one comes to see 4. But I have some advice, keep Buscemi, the Ramono guy! Then every one will see them, even adults, trust me. He does some some R movies that adults like to see, I don't know, I can't see R. But if you liked number 1, see this one."
1,Awful,"I LOVED the first movie, but this was a giant monster of a disappontment! It was silly, contrived, and cartoonish. No plot. Just special effects that were wasted on a movie lacking any substance."
2,boring,"I fell asleep during this movie. I liked the outtakes at the end. They made me laugh. To like this, you need to be 10 or have a ten yearold child"
3,Parents Beware! Not for the little ones,"I saw this movie with a group of children aged 4 to 12. This movie, like the first one, is marketed to entire families and we are led to believe that it is appropriate for everyone. Oh please, if you believe that I happen to have a bridge to sell you.In all fairness, this is a frenetic and inventive movie. Lots of action scenes and neat special effects. And the two kids are simply adorable. But the youngest ones in my party spent the majority of the show cowering behind the seats in front of them. And I'd have to say that the movie provides some bad influence for the older kids too. I mean, a machine that picks the kid's nose for him?? No one should see something like that (I even complained to the theater manager and got free passes!).Still a worthwhile time-passer for kids, if you are a liberal parent."
1,"I've Never Seen the First One, and I Hope I Never Do!","This was the worst movie I saw during the Summer of 2002, and it had to be at a drive-in movie! This movie actually started out fine, and the plot was okay, but nothing can make up for the awful acting in this film. The kids were as good as they could have been with the script-at-hand, and the adults were much worse, especially their parents played concoctedly and horribly by Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. Some little kids may like this movie, and maybe even some adults. Oh well, I can't explain why, but people do seem to. All in all, this movie simply was a bad movie overflowing with bad acting and an okay plot that doesn't make up for any flaws in the end. One good thing-the film isn't long at all, it's quite short. One final bad thing too, however-Alexa Vega finishes up the film with a horrible little song about the movie. You will definitely want to skip past this, whether you liked the film or not."
3,A little over the top believability wise,I know this is sci-fi; but still it's a real stretch of the imagination especially with the creatures.but it was ok. I never saw the first one.
5,If you like Spy Kids you will like 2,"We all enjoyed Spy Kids, Spy Kids2 and Spy Kids 3D. They are good family movies that we all can watch."
4,As good as the first,"Spy Kids 2 is a spectacular time at the movies. Continuing a first movie in a series can be tough, but when you've got enjoyable characters and non-stop action in the sequel, it's hard to not want more. The movie is funny, dialogue clever, special effects dazzling, and characters enjoyable. If you're a fan of the first Spy Kids, this is highly recommended."
4,Isle of Dreams,"Eye glueing...Intresting...Cool...Super...everything to do with cool films.HEROES:Juni CortezCarmen CortezGregorio CortezIngrid CortezGADGETS:RALPHTransmookerDragon Spy DLXMachete Elastic WonderRe-BreathersAn absolutely acceptable movie for kids who have not seen a Spy Kids movie.Who could possibly miss this film?Forget the old films like Shrek2 or Garfield.Get in gear by watching this.If you thought Spy Kids1 was cool, then you will love this film.It will criss cross your mind.Remember,if its on TV dont daremiss it!"
4,Charming,"I honestly liked this movie. The first one was very funny and imaginative, so I was expecting the sequel to be, well, bad. I was wrong. It has comedy, action and adventure, heroes, and enemies (none too scary for the little children). However, like the first movie, the special effects aren't up to par with the latest Lord of the Rings movie; and the plot lines are rather thin. But how can you care when Antonio Banderas is playing the father of two spy children? So follow along with Carmen and her brother Junie as they save the world once again."
1,Not Too Good,This movie was pretty much horrible. The plot was weird and dumb and the kid actors were pretty annoying. Then again kids with a short attention span should be into this.
4,Spy Kids 2-SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE 1st!,"OK, admit it, the 1st movie stank. But Spy Kids 2 was one of the best movies I have seen! Incredible features, sound effects, wonderful plot! DEFINETLY worth buying!"
3,"Expensive, but what can you do?","Although Canon inks are cheaper than my old Epson's original ink, I can't find cheap third party inks for Canon (like the $5 cartridges I could find for my Epson), so Amazon is my best bet.This review is mainly to inform other shoppers that the PG-40 holds 16ml, while the PG-50 holds 22ml."
5,It's Ink; It Works; Good Price,What can I say? It's name brand Canon ink that won't clog your print heads offered at a good price and delivered quickly. No negatives here that I can see.
5,Great price on ink!!,"We all have to buy cartridges for our printers, and this is a good, inexpensive way to do it. I saved a few bucks and the free shipping helped too. Check it out."
3,"Great transaction, not so great on the ink.","Great transaction with seller. Ink cartridges suggest that they hold more ink than the Canon Cl-30, but that is not the case. I can run at least 300 brochures on the Cl-30, but I could only run 200 with this cartridge and nothing on my brochures have changed. I was just very fortunate that I ordered the two pack instead of just one cartridge."
1,don't buy this,don't buy this....the cartridge only worked for about 25 pages! not worth it...better to buy from local store since I think the cartridge wasn't filled all the way..................sucks!
1,bad news ink,"Don't bother with this rip off--I bought a twin pack thinking I was getting a deal over the higher capacity cartridge (50, 51) and it was spent in a few days--really annoyed me. My ""deal"" was no deal at all."
4,Good service,"I got my stuff for 11 days since order.Though,I needed it right away at that time because running out of the inkbut fortunately I still could use with the ink left, so my suggestion isit will be good if delivery between a week."
4,Cheaper to buy one at a time?,"At the time of this review, one PG-40 cartridge costs $17.17 and this double pack costs $35.87.Not really sure why anyone would buy this double pack..."
2,response and shipping too slow- took weeks,"have heard this product does not last very long, but I don't know yet.it took weeks for them to ship and arrive and I had to buy elsewhere.If you need it soon, better not buy here."
1,Where's the ink? Under the pickle?,"I purchased this for my mom's printer from a B&M; large chain office supply store. It was an OEM cartridge, not their brand, or refilled.Now I know why I switched a long time ago to a laser printer.The cartridge lasted maybe, 50 sheets (and I'm being generous!). Unbelievable! Even my old Lexmark inkjet lasted longer than this! It's a MP210, and yes, it's switched to b/w printing, blah, blah, blah. If you only need b/w printing, check out a Brother mono laser. I've had just the plain printer for over a year and love it. Paid about $60 for it. In fact, just bought a Brother all-in-one mono laser and love it too! Plus they're cartridges are MUCH cheaper than others. Like someone else said, these days it's often cheaper to buy a whole new printer than just the cartridge.She got this printer ""free"" in a bundle deal.... I can see why. Unless you own stock in an ink company, RUN RUN RUN away from yjis Canon printer!"
2,Nice appearance but runs out way too fast,"I am a great fan of Canon products generally, but the the printer that requires this cartridge as a refill, well, it uses up the ink oddly fast. With my NEC laser printer, one $100 cartridge will last me 3 years. With this Canon printer, one $20 cartdridge lasts one month most. Do the math."
2,too expensive,"This ink is way too expensive (although it's cheaper here than some brick & mortar stores near me). My Canon MP470 blows through this stuff, and I hate that it somehow needs a color cartridge when printing in black and white, so just this isn't good enough. That's more of a ding against Canon overall than this ink in particular, but the prices are ridiculous for what you get."
4,Good,"The shipment is slightly slower than I expected...But overall, I am happy with the products and Amazon's service...=)"
5,Could not ask for better,"This case is the best thing for the person you know that needs it. It holds everything in well, looks like a sunglasses case, the hard shell on it helps insulate the medicine inside and protects it from taking a beating in your purse or satchel."
1,"Nice wheel, wrong part for my Sears mower...","I have the Craftsman 22"" big wheel mower model #917.388152. This is a good wheel but will not fit my application. The hub bearing spacing (thickness) on my wheel is 2.0"" this one has a spacing of 1.75"". Again this was a good quality wheel but the wrong part for my Sears mower."
2,Outsourced,Made in Taiwan. I've got no opinion on the quality except I was disappointed that Lisle outsourced a product previously made in the U.S.
5,Skate Rock Legend!!!! Buy This NOW!!!,"Chuck is not only a great musician he was a sponsored skateboarder from 1982-1990. Chuck rode for Madrid Skateboards, Gullwing Trucks, OJ Wheels, Santa Cruz Skateboards, Thunder Trucks, Ollie Wheels, Airwalk Sneakers & he had a pro model on Sure Grip. The first time I heard McRad was on the Savannah Slamma skate video. I held my old boombox up to the TV and recorded the songs. The song ""Weakness"" is famous for introducing the world to the infamous ""Rubber Boys"" (Ray Barbee, Steve Saiz and Eric Sanderson)in the video ""Public Domain"". Do yourself a favor and GET THIS CD! If you're an oldschool skate punk you'll know what I'm talking about. This CD makes me want to grab my skate and hit the curbs! Chuck even did a tour playing bass for the BAD BRAINS... how cool is that!!? He's the real deal for sure. I'm waiting for his new band, TENT, to release their album. Reggae, jazz, punk... Chuck is a true artist. Now go do a boneless!"
5,this book is awesome!,"Nancy Drew's Guide to life is a MUST HAVE for every Nancy Drew fan!! There are some serious things in it, and then there are some absolutely outrageuos tips and advice. I love this book! It is really fun to read and its hilarious! Love Nancy Drew? You'll love this. Like her a little? You'll love it even more."
3,"Cute, but I wish there was more to the book","This is a cute book, but I just wish there was a little more substance to it. Still, as a book that fits in the palm of one's hand, I guess it's hard to expect more from it."
3,when they say small book - they mean it,"I was a little disappointed by the book - when the reviews said small book, I thought they meant not many pages - but this really is small about 3 x 4 inches.Some of the lines are funny but I thought they would be more relateable to real life rather than just being silly comments about situations from the book."
4,Guide to Life?,"If this wasn't written with tongue in check, then I misinterpreted a lot of these little ""guides"". Some were a bit outdated, but hey, that just part of the entertainment of this mini book."
2,Stack the Deck: Crazy Quilts in 4 Easy Steps,"The content of this product is excellent, and the inside condition is very good. However the product was represented as ""New and in excellent condition"", when in fact the very center of the front cover has a spot about the size of a large apple where the printed surface is completely torn away and only the white paper backing is showing. Therefore I feel the problem is with the dealer, not the product itself!."
4,"amazing, freeing","I used this book in a class. If you are using it on your own, take your time and experiment with a small project. Most Important to keep track of the order of the cut pieces. Number them on paper and keep on the stack.As you sew them together, do not press them. You must complete a whole block before you press because there are so many pieces on the bias. As you sew, none of the seams will line up and the whole thing looks like a mess. When you finish the block and press it you will be amazed.It is very freeing, you don't have to control anything, except the order in which the pieces must be sewn. Chose your fabrics carefully. When I was finished making a table runner, there were two of the fabrics I did not like so did not use a couple of blocks. The rest were very interesting as random cuts and looked great."
2,If you like the look.,"The cover of the book quite took me in, a bright heart design that looked cute and funky, but I was disappointed with the rest of the designs inside. The other designs aren't as contemporary as I would have liked. Crazy quilting is okay but the designs are not to my taste. I wouldn't have bought it if I could have seen inside."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD Set,"If you read the other comments it will seem clear that this dvd set is defective. That's why Amazon is not carrying it and is only being sold by smarmy marketplace sellers who have jacked up the price on used movies to try to make something back. However, they will not tell you that there is a problem with disc 3. I will. Wait patiently. I'm sure the company that provided this series on dvd, BBC Video, will correct this mistake and release a quality set.I'm giving a rating of 1 for this product. That is strictly for the packaging. My review will go up to 5 when this issue is resolved and series 5 is made available in a quality release with no bugs."
3,I love this show but it was missing disk 5 and came with 2 disk #3s,MI-5 is an awesome show and its always very gripping! You never know when or who will die suddenly or what will happen next which is why I love watching it. I was vastly disappointed to find out when I opened the case (a year after getting it with a season 1-6 set) that I was missing disk #5 and had 2 disk #3s. Amazingly even though this is the UPC of the defective sets the disk #3s appear to work! I just can't move on to season 6 though without season 5's 5th disk
1,MI-5 series 5,"Very disappointed that this series and at least one other in the set of MI-5 series has to be purchased when the other series are part of Amazon prime and therefore free to prime members. This is illogical.Also, my Roku knows I have already purchased series 5. Why does my PC want me to pay for it again?"
3,Entertaining but lacking in reality!,"Love all the series, but have noticed they are really 'reaching' for plausible plots and charachters. My personnal preference is for more realism and less improbable scenarios and charachters. My favorite characters are still Harry and Tom."
5,"FINALLY, the wait is over!!","YES YES YES! I am thrilled beyond words that this DVD will finally be released in the US. I saw the episodes in the UK and I can highly recommend this series. I own all the other four and can't wait to own this one too. This British series (""Spooks"" in the UK) is one of the best series around and trust the Brits to - as usual - create great television. This is definitely a must have DVD!"
1,Defective Disk 3,Great show. Disk 3 is defective as other customers have found out. It does not play.
4,Just because it's MI-5,"Ok, I haven't seen series five yet, but I've seen one through four and this is, hands-down, one of the best TV productions I've ever seen. I came to Amazon this morning to buy the fifth volume but read the reviews and am put off by the disk problems. So, as I have three small, multi-region DVD players, I went over to Amazon.uk and bought it, though in the UK, the series is ""Spooks"". I figure even with the exchange it's still cheaper and I can be fairly sure there will be no missing episodes. I completely recommend this show to anyone interested in this type of programming. As good as ""24"" is, ""MI-5"" (aka ""Spooks""), blows it away and that's saying something. If you're new to MI-5, begin with volume one. Each episode is a complete story but in other ways, each episode is dependant on the ones before. If you start in the middle, you'll be confused. As it's made by the Brits, they assume we're intelligent adults and treat us accordingly."
2,Unbox PC download- ok,"The video on the supposed high quality unbox PC download is just OK. It is overly compressed, IMO. You can clearly see the artifacts and pixelation is almost all of the video. That said, if you do not have a super fast downlink whereby you can stream in high quality, this is better than low quality streaming.Amazon should look at re-encoding their unbox PC downloads with a better codec. This does not look like H.264, IMO."
2,too expensive,The price of this product brings the rating way down. Don't expect the usual 22 shows you get from most usa products. The content of the show is very good! I believe there is only 12 shows and yet you have to pay twice as much. Another ripoff!
2,Great DVD set until you get to disc 3,"I've really enjoyed all the installments of this series and I eagerly awaited volume 5. It finally came and everything was good until I got to disc 3, it just wouldn't play. Tried it on a couple of systems just to make sure it wasn't my set. Same results.Sent that set back and got a replacement, same thing happened. Now I'm really unhappy because this problem has left me hanging to see the rest of the series. Hopefully this will be rectified soon."
3,Politically Correct,"Given that it is a British product I can take the anti-Americanism of this season, but the villains are almost entirely other parts of the British intelligence services, corporate types, right-wingers, Israelis, Christian fundamentalists, and even those who would suppress the supposed truth of global warming . Apparently there aren't any standard-issue terrorists to be had. Another problem is with the high cast turnover, only Harry and Malcolm are around from earlier days. That said this remains a high-quality series, and episode 9 is terrific"
3,"Great show, bizarre political correctness","Great action and acting, but just a bizarre fantasy world ideology when it comes to picking villains. (I say this as a Nader voter.) Is the real threat these days Christian terrorists? Israeli agents killing Englishmen? Even more Mossad agents? According to this show it is. Classic case of ""Oh no! Mustn't feed stereotypes, must instead choose totally implausible PC villains."""
2,Beware!!! Bad Disk Manufacturing Problem!,"I LOVE this show but the wait for the DVDs can be so long. So finally this volume shows up in the states and one of the disks doesn't work. Its the same problem other reviewers have had: disk 3 doesn't work or if you can access it, it has a duplicate episode (from the disk 2) and then is missing the next episode in the series, a crucial one that involves a permanent change in the show! None of the other disks have the episode and I have returned 2 of these box-sets so I would say this is definitely a manufacturing problem. Sooo: good luck."
4,Pink Sweatshirt,"The pink sweatshirt I ordered is great. My only concern is that I ordered a Medium and this is a bit big, however, I am sure it will shrink and be perfect. The color is just what I saw on line and the item came in timely fashion."
4,Good product,This fits true to size and does not 'pill' like so many other sweatshirts. Very soft inside and out with the 50/50.
3,Vintage Navy,"The sweatshirt material, construction, quality is fine. The picture and description of ""vintage navy"" however are WAY off. This color is navy, period. It looks NOTHING like the soft, garmet dyed looking sweatshirt shown. Do not waste the extra money going with this one. Very disappointed."
4,Great But..,"I would have ordered bigger, i ordered my size and it still was short around my waist, should have got a bigger size."
4,Four Stars,"Nice material and color. Washes well BUT,,,,it was soooo big!Guess it just runs full. I would not mind ordering another color but will obviously go smaller."
1,Don't buy from them!,"I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada. I knew it wouldn't get there in time for Christmas, but I didn't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address! Hell, they delivered it to the wrong country! When I tried contacting them, they didn't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails. I will NEVER buy from them again and I wouldn't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place. I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it, because my boyfriend never will. Nothing like paying good money for nothing!!!!!!!"
5,Great for the price.,This is a great product for the price that it is being sold for. Much warmer than I expected and fits great. I will probably buy more in the future. Great colors!
4,Thin material,This sweatshirt is okay. The material is thin for a sweatshirt. Also it has quite a bit of fuzz. Otherwise it fits according to size. I don't know how it will wash up. But it is a good brand so we can hope.
2,Lite weight sweatshirt,"This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors, but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it."
4,Nice,Cannot understand the fluctuation on price. It changes from day to day! But the brand is a good one and color washes true.
2,Poor quality,"Proof that you get what you pay for, these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy. Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans. Ribbing around collar is especially thin. I am still searching for the real thing."
3,Shrinks some,"This is nice quality. My only problem with this is it does shrink some in the dryer. It wasn't a terrible amount. However, I should have bought the next size larger. This was just a nice fit before washing and drying. Actually wouldnt have hurt this sweatshirt to have been slightly larger to begin with. After it shrunk I gave it away. I am buying more of these! The material is very nice. I am ordering a larger size."
5,Great Book! Change begins within.,I found this book very helpful as I look at changes I need to make in my own life and as I think about helping others get outside of themselves and see what it means to be a person living the God intended us to live.
3,Good book but hard to read,"I liked this book, he makes really good points on bringing priority into what is really important in life and exposing some common ideas about Christian life that do not come from the Bible. But I think I must read the book again to understand what he is saying, the problem is I don't have the patience to go through his long thoughts again! The book could easily been half of what it is now. So my struggle was more with the style of writing rather than with the contents. and I'm not the only one, we used this book for a group study for about 9 months and the others had similar problems with the style of writing, but we all agreed that it is a good book!o one more thing, we read it in Dutch!"
2,Has presented a biased view on Sri lanka,"As a another Sri lankan, i too must say that McGowan has no proper understanding of Sri Lanka & its culture.although he does a good job researching & presenting sri lankan history accurately.Some aspects he has written on are laugheable and truely reflects the authors ignorance.he has presented a biased view of the sinhalese community & buddhism and labeled negative streotypes on the community.most sinhalese people are not racists.The book is biased and lacking in any sort of understanding of the sri lankan culture."
1,Too much room in Hell,"If you're a Dawn fanatic, don't get too excited about this panel-by-panel re-drawing of Romero's classic.On the one hand, you would think that the pink-blooded, sometimes comic-bookish tone and characters of the film would translate well to a comic book. On the other hand, a panel-by-panel presentation of the film we know and love is not only unnecessary, but it's not even well done.The artwork is lame, the color is blah, the inking is serviceable, the whole thing is rather pointless. There's gore, sure, but it's almost too much, too late. Nothing is done with the themes of the film, nothing is done to increase appreciation of a horror classic.If you want anything 'literary' with regards to Dawn, track down the novelization that Romero co-write when the film appeared. Heck, even track down the academic study of Romero's work. The latest Dawn Ultimate DVD box set (highly recommended) contains the first issue of this 3 book series. Don't even bother to 'collect them all'!"
3,Not much to say.,"There's not much to say about this comic. It's pretty much exactly like the first couple of scenes from the movie. The artwork is not that amazing and there is not as much action like in the film. Also, unlike in the film the message behind the story is not as compelling which is weird considering the comic follows the story of the movie exactly. There's not much of anything new in this comic that one has not already seen if they have seen the 1978 film. I would say buy the comic if you like anything zombies, but if you want something compelling it's probably better to pass on the Dawn of the Dead comic."
2,Non-user friendiness,"Factors that contributed to a low rating for this book include, a lack of user-friendliness and lengthy case studies. The blue colored wordings (black would be better) can be quite glaring under the lights making it not smoothing to the eyes.Furthermore, it uses long case studies which could have been shortened by cutting down on the introductions to the companies it made reference to. More focus should be given to concepts at the earlier stage of every section, instead of making the reader running through a lengthy introduction before focusing on the concepts.Important concepts could also have been left out. One example would be the omission of 'Reduced Cost' under the chapters of Linear Programming and Integer Programming.However, this book is certainly catered to users of MS Excel. It has in-depth discussions of Excel in areas of Management Science"
4,Do not see the American Version....,"if you have and thought it was only OK but could have been better than see this...the better version. This movie out shines the remake big time. The Acting here is so much more convinceing (at least I think so...they talk Dutch) and I felt scared when the nightwatchman was scared...he's kinda buff, so I felt like he could whoop butt unlike the sissy american actor so when was scared I was.The direction in this version was better because it gives you the feeling someone is alway watching you and a more clastrphobic feel to this version that the american one lacks.See this if you want a good mystery/suspence/thriller for a movie going experiance.WARINING:If you hate subtitles then stay clear."
1,Worse than Atlanta Nights,"I did not buy this book. Someone asked me to read it. Couldn't get past the first page. Dreadful, cliche' ridden, nonsensical writing.As you might know, Atlanta Nights was a prank book, deliberatly written to be awful. This is worse. Maybe it gets its horror rating for its blatant butchery of the English language."
3,Motivating and Inspiring,"Mark Salzman's tale of working with young adult's in a Los Angeles County detention center is extremely moving and an excellent story of somebody giving back to a group who rarely if ever meets adults who care and are willing to invest their time. I was moved by many of the young adults' writings interspersed between Salzman's writings. While moving and inspiring, Salzman's True Notebooks is also a fair account of young adults in the justice system."
5,Kids who don't have it together can be helped!,"This is an insightful book into the world of lost kids under the age of 18. Providing a writing program where these kids express their rage is a step forward in healing them. My son is one of these kids, and he tells me that writing has helped him a lot. I understand what these kids are battling against and I highly recommend this book. I also suggest Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self. I gave Optimal Thinking to my son 5 months ago and it turned his thinking and life around. He says he is going to use Optimal Thinking to make the most of every moment in prison. My kid says he now has the confidence to make the best of his life."
3,A bit repetitious,"I like Mark Salzman, and liked his novel LYING AWAKE very much. This book is a memoir of the year he spent teaching creative writing in a juvenile detention center. He is candid and honest about his fears and concerns going into the project, and watching his prejudices melt away is quite fascinating, as the reader can't help be identify with the emotional ride. Where the book is less strong, in my opinion, is in the writing from the actual students, which takes up probably a third of the book. I understand Salzman wanting to 1) give these boys a voice and 2) reveal something of the boys' interior landscapes. The problem is the writing is repetitious after a while, and since it isn't very good (although some does have undeniable impact) it begins to feel tedious. Salzman's portraits of the boys themselves, as well as those of a fiercely activist nun, and several surprisingly sympathetic staff members, is much more rewarding, and poignant."
4,Great read,"What a wonderful read! A writer with writer's block is asked to teach a writing school at a juvenile detention center. He accepts and this book describes his moments with the kids and their writing experiences.I picked up this book totally at random. The cover did not attract me, but the storyline sounded different.What a treat. The writing is breezy and honest, but the most interesting aspect is the author's view of the boys in his class. Or rather the sometimes surprisingly good writings included in the book, which were all done by the kids.I find it great interesting that the author actually made me like these kids. I, also forgot that they were (in most part) murderers.A great read. Please pick up this book - its well worth it."
5,This book is a gem--please read it,"I couldn't put this book down. It inspired me, surprised me, made me laugh, made me cry. I don't know how Mark Salzman does it but he makes writing look easy. His style is all about telling the stories in a nonjudgmental yet insightful way unencumbered by literary theatrics or hyperbole. I can't imagine anyone reading this and not being moved by it in some way. This is a perfect book.After finishing it, the characters continue to haunt me and I've decided to buy a few more copies to send to family and friends so I can spread the word about this wonderful piece of literature. We need more books like this to bring about understanding which in turn breeds compassion."
4,true and astonshing work,"Author Mark Salzman admits right off the bat that he wanted to refuse a friend's request to lead a writing group at a juvenile hall. He's uncomfortable around teenagers, and he feels unqualified to teach minority youths from a different background than his. Those would be on my list of reasons to refuse, too. But he goes and finds the students to be surprisingly articulate, more so than the adult education students he teaches elsewhere. The inmates in turn, irritate, amaze, disgust, and impress Salzman with their writing. Some go on to healthier lives, some don't, but he manages (cliche though it is) to make an impact on quite a few - mostly when he believes he's done the opposite. Highly recommended."
4,True Notebooks: A book to read,"Among today's T.V. shows, films, news, and documentaries, this book is truly a book to be read. You get to read about Mark Salzman and how his life changed when he began teaching at a Juvenile Detention Facility. You get to read the conversations and the writings of Marks students, who suprisingly are Juvenile Delinquents. As you read you will find yourself seeing that you have more in common with Marks students than you could have guessed. This book is truly filled with writings that inspire and make the mind fill with images. The conversations overflow eith personality and emotion. Sure this book may not be action packed or romantic, but it is what you do not read about, hear about on the radios, or watch on the T.V. every day. It is real."
4,"A Major book about the ""minors""","The ""minors"" in the Juvenile Hall facility in Los Angeles are alive and jiving and writing their hearts out. Salzman describes his time teaching them writing or rather giving them the time and space to write what they can say to no one.This book satisfies because it is embedded in the writer's life. He shares his own true reactions, his failures, his successes. He grows in understanding of his students and we grow along with him.I visit this facilty weekly and Salzman has captured the boys there, the staff and even the physical surroundings perfectly. His work helped me to understand some of what I see."
5,Excellent,"Very easy read, very informative on what its like for these juveniles who are caught up in our legal system. My words for review cannot describe how good of an account this is."
5,A truly moving read,"Salzman's latest is my favorite of his so far. It is not some glossy ""To Sir, With Love"" or ""Dangerous Minds"" but a real, insightful glimpse into the world of juvenile delinquents, showing them at their most vulnerable. Their stories (in their own words) are depressing, funny, heart wrenching and violent - but all are brutally honest. Their writings are framed by Salzman's thoughtful and spare prose; without judging these troubled kids he helps us appreciate how they became who they are. It is not a hopeful book, but it does build compassion and understanding, which is much more useful than hope. It is a fantastic book."
5,Great value!,"I love this necklace. I was pretty impressed with the quality for the price. I hate buying jewelery online, but this one really was worth it! And it looks great on!"
1,sterling silver celtic design square pendant,"This looks nothing like the picture. There is a big stamp on the back that says ""made in china"" Dull in color, very questionable if it is actually sterling silver."
4,Very pretty,"I asked DH to buy these for me for Christmas along with a matching pair of earrings. Both are very nice. I took a star off because the chain was tangled badly when I opened it, it was just loose in the bag. The chain is pretty flimsy but I was already planning to use a longer chain for it than the 18"" chain. The pendant itself is nice, and the velvet pouches and outer boxes are nice presentation."
5,It should not be mandatory to write a product review,It should not be mandatory to write a product review It should not be mandatory to write a product review It should not be mandatory to write a product review
4,Celtic Pendant,"This is a nice necklace/pendant for the price, and easy to wear with many necklines. I bought the matching earrings and they look good together."
2,Not great quality,I was expecting a good quality product for the amount of money on this piece. The detail isn't great and I wouldn't buy this again
4,Marvy shaving soap,"The product arrived as indicated and is OK for my needs. It's not Burma Shave, who discontinued production of their shaving bar soap. Marvy requires you to buy 12 bars at a time, as a minimum order,which should last me about 7 years."
2,"Too foamy, doesn't make lasting lather.",Maybe someone else can get this soap to make lather that doesn't evaporate before you set your brush down. I had to add 1/2 oz oil to it to get it to stop foaming. Perhaps taking a long time to build lather would make it work. But Van der Hagen soap works instantly and gives great lather. So why bother with Marvy?
5,Superb treatment of this subject of transference!,Good expose' on what can happen in our lives and with those we are in relationship. The insights she shared has greatly helped our church in a time of upheaval and unrest.
3,"A good primer, but dated","If you're new to trading or technical analysis, this is a good primer. Much of the information in this book is based on a concept that I had discovered shortly before acquiring this book, that all the technical indicators in the world are so much smoke and mirrors if they don't factor volume into the equation.This book was written in an era before home computers and many of the tools we have at our fingertips today. It was also written in an era before the ""average"" guy could directly control his portfolio in real time. For this reason, a lot of the signals he teaches as buy/sell indicators have been drowned out by increased volume and noise. The computer age has made the market more efficient and faster to react, which has dated his signals on a macro level. Nevertheless, the underlying concepts are sound."
2,No longer a good product due to cheapening of design,"This used to be a great baster - the best. I am sorry to say that the manufacurer decided to make the walls of the bulb out of thinner silicon than they did just a short time ago. This change has made it nearly useless as a baster as it now lacks ""sucking-power"". It is truly unfortunate that an excellent product has been rendered useless by a short-sighted decision to save some money. Shame on the pin-head(s) responsible.... shame. I have little experience with other ISI products but this baster says a lot about what you can expect from ISI."
5,Ure & Ultravox,"I've had his song, If I Was, in my memory for years. It took me time to find out who he was and if Mr.Ure had any discs in production. Thankfully, I was able to find this one. I almost prefer best of/greatest hits cd's because they have all the songs I like and more on them. From time to time I get a hits cd and an album that I like from the same band. Like A-Ha for example. Try this one as well."
4,Time to kick some butt!,"Being a horror fan from way back, I had to get this game. It took some time to find it, but I got it. And I'm glad I did.The action and graphics on this game are pretty good. If there is a story/plot to it, I'm not sure what it is, because I have too much fun shooting things up.One bit of advice, invest money in the MadCatz gun designed for Xbox that goes with this game. You can use a controller, but the gun makes the game go easier.The zombies in the game are pretty cool, and the bosses make the game more interesting, because they're harder to kill.If you're looking for a fun game, or a stress release, this is the game for you."
5,Fun,People think this game is short. Thats because its an arcade game. People whould not put out a game for an arcade thats 12 hours. You pay 25 cents and get a few minutes of fun. but now its availibal for xbox. Don't judge on length. It's got A+ graphics and supports the light gun. It's good
2,Two problems with this game,"Two things wrong with this game. You can't save a game in progress, which means every time you play, you HAVE to start at the begining, which can get tedious really fast. Second, you can't move around at will (like in Halo or Quake, for example) the game pretty much moves you around at it's pace, you're more like a passenger. That having been said, the gore is really well done, too bad they didn't allow saving, it would have taken the quality of the game to a higher level. This feels and plays like an arcade game (which I suppose it is) but I think the price should be significantly less because of this (at a comparable price, Halo give you a much more in-depth experience)."
3,"SHOULD BE CALLED ""HOUSE OF MONOTONY""","SHOULD BE CALLED ""HOUSE OF MONOTONY"". I bought this game in the hopes of mindlessly shooting zombies. Maybe I thought it would be like MAX PAYNE or MEDAL OF HONOR: FRONTLINE. I was wrong. This game forces you to approach various situations. You can't avoid them or approach from other angles. In addition, you cannot save after each chapter, so you are forced to start all over. A player can only take so much of skipping the movie and being told where to shoot the Security Guard and the Thing in the Cage. Very dull and frustrating. Skip this one."
4,Good old-fashion fun!,"How can you go wrong with zombie blasting? The game provides plenty of arcade-type action, awesome graphics, and just about nada as far as the plot goes. But as long as you don't expect a storyline on par with Halo, you should have a good time. The game plays fine without a light gun, although the game loses a bit when you use the controller to aim. This is a great game to have around when you only want to play for a few minutes, or you want to relieve some stress. Again, I thought the graphics were superbly done."
4,Good fun!,Pretty fun game but with any point and shoot got old kinda fast. A good game to have gives you somthing to do when you buds are over.
3,Was a little dissapointed,"House Of The Dead III was O.K. It is shorter than 2(only 4 bosses, Security Guard,Monkey, Plant and Curien. 2 having 6(Flying Guy, Sea Guy, Snakes, Chansaw, Magician, The Emporor) When you beat the game, you can earn the whole House Of The Dead 2. In the end, I would give it 3.99. Dosen't deserve a 4.0"
2,I would only recommend to those whom are blind!,"The concept is great. I received the color chips and matched the color and confirmed with my interior designer.The problem is after two weeks I received the toilet seat. While I was pleased by the quality toilet seat - the color was not even close to the color chip. I ordered brown and got bright orange- YUK!I confirmed that the number on the box matched the color chip ... which it did. But what good is it, if they don't follow their own color chips?I recommend first checking with the manufacturer to see if your toilet is labeled with a color code. If not ... I wish I would of just taken part of my toilet to the local Home Depot or plumbing store - so I could see what I was getting."
3,Good Print Quality - But OEM Sticker Price,"WIth the cost of printers coming down, it makes more sense to purchase a new printer that gets a better Cost-per-copy than it is to buy OEM cartridges. Look for a Laser Printer at a steal of a price."
5,Perfect Cartridge,"It's hard to find a real seller who sells cartridges in the Internet. Prior to my purchase from Amazon, I bought one (new item) from the seller who claimed to have 100% feedback but only find to out later that the cartidge he sent me was dried. I'm lucky enough to find one that is real , and that is from the Amazon. I strongly recommend buyers to always consider checking Amazon first before browsing another website."
4,Good Ink Cartridge,This is a relatively easy cartridge to use. I have yet to print the purported 600 pages with it. The downside of this product is the price. It is quite expensive.
5,ink,great service fast delivery better than going to walmart cuase they only had this item in a 2 pack and i only needed one
1,Failed to work.,"I just went to use the black ink cartridges (2) that I ordered back in November of 2012. Both cartridges failed to pass the alignment check on my Lexmark printer. It asked me to remove the tape. When I tried to print something in black, the page came out blank. On the side of the cartridges it has not for customer use and it looks like japanese writing. I will never order from this supplier again. I have always orderd through Amazon with no troubles in the past. I put my old cartidge back in and the printer works just fine.On review your purchase it states that I can't return the product because it's past the deadline for returns. Amazon needs to remove this seller from it's supplier list. Look at the list of complaints."
1,Worked 2 days of limited use and quit.,"This product did not last, stopped working the second day in the middle of printing a map I needed. It was new still in the box and wrapped and arrived in good condtion and this is not the fault of the vendor, possibly on the shelf too long maybe or a manuracturers defect. It lasted 2 and 1-2 pages and was dry."
1,"Not satisfied, not as pictured/described","The item I received was NOT in a box as shown in the product description, nor is it an actual OEM Lexmark cartridge. It arrived only in a silver wrapper, and a label on the cartridge reads ""NOT FOR CUSTOMER USE!"" Really?To make matters worse, it doesn't produce any ink when something is printed. I've already emailed Amazon support asking for guidance."
4,Lexmark Ink Cartridges,Good value and shipped promptly. Difficult to find cartridges for older Lexmark models online is really the only way to purchase them without hunting through store after store.
5,Quality as expected,"The X5051 Lexmark printer that I bought this for has been using this ink (#82) for years. Never any problems - only need to replace when it's low. Easy to install as well as replace. Will continue to buy (and likely from amazon too, as it's always cheaper here.) :-)"
1,Piece of junk!,I bought 2 cartridges for my Lexmark. i opened one today and it said not for customer use and it didn't work! The second cartridge was the same! i just wasted a bunch of money!
1,Did not work!,I was hoping to save some money on ink but this one did not work. It came with colored ink that was OEM that worked great. But the black wouldn't work. It showed I had full black ink but nothing black would print. Had to return it. I would suggest if buying online here make sure it says OEM
5,No problems,Worked without a hitch in my printer. Installed with ease. Much cheaper than in stores (if they even stock it).
2,"Not in orig pkg, Not for resale","I ordered 2 of these. Neither was in the original Lexmark box. Both were marked not for resale. One did not work at all, the second one seems to be working fine."
1,Not as described,Was supposed to be new OEM but was remanufactured without box and wouldn't print. Would not purchase again.Waste of money!
1,"these bianca towles were great 6 months ago, but now...","I purchased these towels six months ago and they were great-they were super soft, and very thick. However, I decided to buy more of these last week, and this time-they were completely worthless since they were extremely thin, and not soft at all. Save your 2 bucks per towel, and buy them at W@lmart-they will probably have better quality towels at this price point."
4,Virus,"The acting is very good, the plot nothing new. I like the interaction of the two main characters, Hoffman and Russo. They pull off the movie. Gooding, Jr. and Freeman are convincing in their parts. The directing is right in there and keeps you watching and waiting, in the right places!"
4,OUTBREAK - Blu-Ray,"I love this movie, one of those movies I can see over & over again and still not get tired of it, the confrontation between Hoffman & Freeman is really a treat, video & audio are much improved on this blu ray, great supporting casts as well, hope you'll enjoy this movie as much as I do."
5,Outbreak is great!,"Outbreak is great for explaining how viruses work! It shows level 3 & 4 viruses, and how they can spread."
4,"one of the earlier ""biological threat"" movies",My son is getting into microbiology and we have been watching movies with a biological warfare/national security theme this summer! We like this one better than Andromeda Strain and Soylent Green!Great cast!
2,Outbreak,"This video had english dubbing in it. I have no idea why. I needed to watch it for a class, believe it or not, and did not have time to send it back or I surely would have. It was very irritating and I really do not appreciate receiving a DVD with that on it. I have never seen a DVD with that on it either. I really ought to send it back and get my money back. Very disappointing...."
1,A bad movie,"This movies is a scarecrow; it is very unrealistic; the atmosphere is wrong, look at the soldiers, their behavior etc."
1,terrible,people aren't going to like this movie. People will probably find it very forgettable. I sure did. What a waste of the good performances.
4,Outbreak,A good movie that keeps your attention and intrique. Great actors and actresses add to the plot. It is effective in making you hope nothing like that could ever really happen. I'm glad I added it to my collection.
1,Movie was Good,Playback was terrible! Stop start....many times. Never had that problem on Netflix. Good movie just hard to watch with the bad playback!
5,my fave disaster movie,"I adore this movie. I've seen it so many times I cant even remember how many. The performances were all very good and believable. I love Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo, oh yea, and just about every other actor in this. Just a wonderful collaberation. The film itself is pretty tense. I can actually picture somthing like this happening since I'm fairly certain it has happened before(just not to this extent). That is what is so scary about this movie, it all seems very believable, it almost makes me nervous. But if anyone is looking for a good tense action film, this is one for you."
3,Entertaining Flick,"This was a pretty fun movie. I mean, it wasn't real deep or genius, but it's really entertaining. It's about a deadly virus in Africa that is spread by monkeys originally. Once you get the virus, you're dead in about 2 days. As a desperate attempt to stop this virus, a monkey with the virus is illegally smuggled into the U.S. to be tested and to possibly stop this virus. However, the monkey is released into the streets, infects one guy, then the virus spreads incredibly rapidly and infects the whole town. Everyone is dropping like flies. Then, the main character, Dustin Hoffman's, wife gets the virus. In order to save her and the whole town, Dustin Hoffman really needs to catch this monkey before it spreads the virus even further. This movie's a classic. If you haven't seen it, you really should."
2,Ludicrous,"I doubt there has ever been an assemblage of so many A-list actors, such a respected director, and so much hardware in the service of such a bad movie. The scientists all act like they have no idea what their lines mean or how scientists behave - everyone except for Morgan Freeman overacts absurdly. The plot, such as it is, is beyond ridiculous, culminating in the most pointless and unmotivated helicopter chase I can remember seeing. It's almost as if the director had in mind that he had to put in a helicopter chase, regardless of its role in the plot. There are too many movie cliches to mention. The whole film reminds me of that parody of bad Hollywood moviemaking that Anna Scott reads for in Notting Hill.The highlight of the film is a bravura 3-minute single-shot steadicam tour of the lab (starting at about minute 4). It's a great shot and shows that Petersen still had it; I guess he lost interest in the movie after that shot though.The blu-ray transfer is excellent."
2,"I love the movie, not the picture quality...","Outbreak was as good as I remembered it. Good film about a scary, town-wide quarrantine.The film quality is absolutely terrible. It is as if someone cheaply stole / copied / ripped the film from some original. I wish to heck I had paid more for a better quality DVD."
4,The one book survival guide for life in the kitchen.,"Craig Claiborne has presented the fundamentals for ""exploration"" and ""colonization"" of the most essential room in everyone's home! The presentations are crisp and clear and every recipe or set of instructions actually works! The primer gives basic lists of tools, simple recipes, lots of explanations and inspires confidence on every page. When I was a novice in the kitchen, this book was a map and compass. Now, many years later, it is a valued reference book that contains many fundamentals. While not as comprehensive as ""The Joy of Cooking"", this little book deserves an early place on the kitchen bookshelf. And it is a great book to give as a gift to ""start-up"" cooks (such as the college grad in a first apartment)!"
4,A Great Little Cookbook.,This is one of my favorite cookbooks. I bought this book in 1980 and still have my original copy. That the pages are stained and tattered is testiomny to the many good meals I've cooked using Craig Claiborne's recipies. This book is an excellent first cookbook as it explains things very well without getting too technical. It would also make a great addition to the library of any casual cook.
4,Pam Clements God's Woman,"I found Pam's book to be positive. It can definitely be utilized for our young men and women today in need of direction, motivation, and inspiration to be all that they can be; to unleash the passion for whatever purpose God has given them in terms of having a vision. It will inspire you to push pasted any negative influence that has the potential to cause you to stumble or give up. This book will cause you to believe in yourself and take action to pursue your dreams. Luke 1:45 Stay encouraged Sis Pam."
3,Not enough breed specific information,"When I got my Boston Terrier puppy 3 months ago, I read every book I could get my hands on. This was one of them. I was hoping to get very specific informaiton relating to Boston Terriers and how to raise a puppy. It has information about their origin, their physical characteristics and showing them, but not necessarily their personalities, what to feed them, caring for them, etc. That informaiton was very general for all puppies. I was able to find more specific information on the internet. It did have good general information on training and if you didn't read any other books, it would give you a good bit of helpful information."
4,What a great 60's pop star Dusty proved to be.,Dusty Springfield is often thought of at her best in the soulful ballad genre and whilst I do not disagree with that point it is often forgotten what a great sixties pop star she was in the fast beat style. This album is a great reminder of her early days. As well as her famous early hits there is the classic recording of 24 Hours from Tulsa where she really sings not just the words but the emotion as well and is a real treasure. The other great track is Anyone Who Had a Heart where this song really comes to life compared to the version by Cilla Black which made number 1 in the UK. For anyone who wants to understand why Dusty was such a great star should listen to these tracks. Even the most banal numbers are sung with conviction and the unique Dusty sound is ever present.
4,Awesome Miniatures Game,"Wings of War is a must have for anyone who enjoys history, board games, authentic miniatures, and strategy. While these miniatures are not necessary for this game to be played, they do enhance it greatly. The playability is easy due to simple game mechanics and the realism of this game will capture the interest of children as young as 7 or 8...as well as others. My wife even enjoys this game. This game subtly teaches anticipation, planning, and spacial abilities. It also brings people together. Get the game for sure!...and get the miniatures if you can in order to enhance the game."
5,hardcore,i think from autumn to ashes is one of the best cd's i have ever heard besides atreyu and zao and a static lullaby and evergreen terrarace! i think the cd couldnt get any better.
2,"If you like REAL hardcore, stay away!","There is perhaps one decent song on this album, short stories with tragic endings, however, it is far too long and not ""epic"" like so many people claim. FATA aren't a ""hardcore"" band nor are they an ""emo"" band like so many claim. They're basically a metal band with stupid sludgy guitar parts, childish guttural vocals and whiny singy parts. Metal fans, stay away too, because this is maiden-esque metal played poorly, with some shades of what nu-metal has evolved into. This is for kids who were fans of slipknot 4 years ago and think that they have ""matured.""If you like emo, check out Sunny Day Real Estate.If you like hardcore, check out Bane.If you like metal, check out Shadows Fall."
4,Just a quick note,"An Amazeing album... but a lot of people talk about the feamle singer from ""Short Stories With Tragic Endings"", her names Melanie Wills and shes the singer from One True Thing (http://onetruething.net) there a grate band..."
5,Unreal,Wow......FATA is unreal....This is possibly one of the best CD's I have heard in a long time. Any hard music fan MUST have this album
3,Shows promise,"This is the type of CD that often comes right before a band makes that final breakthrough. FATA are a good band, no question. The emotion is felt throughout, the guitarists certainly did their metal/hardcore homework. The vocalist can get annoying, a little too nasaly at times, but shows promise.The last track is a gimmick, I don't care what anyone says. The girl sounds like it was one of the guys' girlfriends or something. She has a pretty voice, no question, but she has trouble staying on pitch and in key. I can see the PTW and Glassjaw similarities and the black/death metal in here as well.Buy this for sure if you're a fan of this band or this genre of music, maybe purchase a later CD of FATA if you are new to this style. I would fully expect this band to develop into a 4.5-5.0 star band in the near future (remember, these guys are pretty young)."
3,Not a grabber,"I'm fairly new to the whole ""emo metal"" scene, but I have to say that this album has kept me a fan of it.Although its a lot of pounding drums and ragging guitars followed by the screaming of the lead singer, it does posses very good lyrics. My favorite song on the CD is Mercury Rising, i quote it all the time. It's so beautifully written, possibly the best I've ever come across. ""Eulogy"" is another great song, as well as ""Cherry Kiss"".If you're not a SERIOUS fan, I suggest not getting this album."
5,FATA,"dude FATA ""to bad your beautiful"" is one of the greatest cds ever made. Everysong is just so amazing the vocals are awsome the way he can scream then sing its mind blowing. Plus guitars are hardcore and the drummer is the man. I have listend to this cd forever i know everything about it. ""Short stories with tragic endings"" and ""take her to the music store"" are my two favorite and the aucoustic song is just down right awsome. Seriously buy this cd."
4,Drummer from FATA and PETA interview!,"If you like this band, be sure to check out the interview People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals did w/ their drummer, Fran!http://www.peta2.com/ot/o-fata.html"
3,"Almost a good album, but easily fixed!","Here's what you can do to turn this mediocre release into something semi-decent;;burn the album and omit tracks 3, 4, and 10. 3 & 4 are hilariousy funny, so before you copy the disc listen to them once for a good laugh. Track ten is just bad; way too long and the female vocals ruin it. 33 minutes and 7 tracks is the perfect amount of time you'll ever want to spen with this band. So do this and you're good to go."
1,the girl,the female singer is the only thing that makes this cd have a listenable to song. if you like excessive screaming then go for it but i can not handle lyrics that are enitrely screamed its ridiculous.
1,As we say in french: À CHIER!,I don't know how reasonable people can like this crap. The screamed stuff is pathetic and the unscreamed stuff is just incredibly boring! Disgusting CD with only one good tune. Go and find it.
1,"Metal for fags? Generic Emo Wimp ""metal""",I didn't know whether to take these guys serious.Based on what i listned to was the most annoying/hilarious vocals possiblethe drummer is average for the genre.the guitarist is pretty boringbass? i couldlnt tell if they had oneanother generic emo band on mtv.hot topic material
3,MMmm...,"Not completely horrible, but doesnt seem as well put together as The Fiction We Live. It seems that there is a huge lack of rythm in this one. It feels as thought they tried to do too much on this..."
3,From Autumn To Ashes,"Well, this is not as bad as some people say it is and it's certainly not as good as some others claim it to be. The music here is not hardcore, let there be no mistake. Although it draws heavily from metalcore it is basically just emo, or I guess you could call it 'screamo'. It is not revolutionary or groundbreaking, that's for sure. Besides the fact that they are basically ripping off Poison the Well at almost every turn they seem to be borrowing almost everything they do from another band. However, they piece together an album that is at its worst, decent, and at its best, pretty good. The lyrics are straight up emo heartbreak and don't really come off as very heartfelt or honest. This is even more evident if you see them live. On stage they seem kind of pretentious. Despite that, I still seem to really enjoy listening to it. This is good in the same way that the new Star Wars movies are good, i.e. not at all but somehow kind of cool anyways."
4,Does Everyone in the Band Have ADD???,"The music is great, if you're a fan of hardcore you'd love it. But if you edge more towards the emo side of the house, this CD is just to jumpy. I think I would really love this album if they didn't change the song like, 7 times during a 3 minute song. Still a good buy though."
4,Lonely Winds,"A very good book that held my attention to the end, leaving me wanting more. There were a few typos, but the storyline was good enough to let me overlook those.B.I. is a witty and unpredictable writer that has done a great job with this book. His humor is like a breath of fresh air. I'm looking forward to the next book!"
4,"Great Watch, But Scratches Easily","I got this as a birthday gift, and it is a gorgeous watch. The only issue I have is that it scratches easily. I have had it a year and it's getting some noticeable scratches, even though I don't wear it everyday. It seems to scratch the worst on the band, so at least you don't see it as much, but it's still an issue for an expensive watch..."
4,A fine ECKANKAR Book written by a most excellent author.,"This is inspirational and yet beautiful at the same time. It is a must read for any Eckankar chelas. I read the book, and each time that I rearead it, I gain a greater insight into myself and the world around me. I was amazed that the author wrote this book. It just goes to show you how intertwined our soul matrices are. As I have stated, it is a MUST READ for anyone interested in ECKANKAR. It is also an inspirational story for those not involved in the teachings. If you are interested in religion, spirituality and the development of the self, then you will not be disappointed. This is a great book to read."

1,Too difficult!,"Let me start by saying that I was never good at Permutations and Combinations in high school. With the intention of changing that, I bought this book (the Kindle version, which is based on the Second Edition) some time ago to try to teach myself combinatorics. However, I wasn't really able to progress beyond Chapter 4 (there are 18 chapters in all) as the problems become way too difficult. Perhaps if there were exercises after each section rather than after each chapter, that would make learning a lot easier.Yesterday I bought ""Combinatorics and Graph Theory"" by John M. Harris et al and hope I will have better luck with it."
3,Nothing a few good editors couldn't fix,"...but they didn't. Full of problems. This is a cute story that suffers terribly from bad writing. The characters are wooden, the dialog is forced and unlikely. Anders doesn't understand the management of time or space. The narrative is always disjointed and never flows well. It's hard to tell the characters apart, aside from by name, because really they don't have distinct personalities. OK, it's poorly written but it's still a nice story and approaches teen gender issues from a new direction. That's a worthy thing to do. I only wish he'd done a better job on the execution."
5,Kensington M505 Hard Case,"Recommend it as a very good value. Offers excellent protection for the price. Attractive. Only drawbacks are need to remove PDA from Kensington hard case to sync or charge. This is not hard to do, but is a bit of a nuisance. The case takes enough more space to fill a shirt pocket."
3,Good Protection,"The item offered good protection, but that's just about it. I use my Palm with the Seiko ThumBoard, so it's not that useful while it's in the case. However, if you're looking for a good way to protect it during transport (purse, etc.), then this would be perfect for you."
2,got only becasue it was free,"I got this as free item that came along with replacement battery. I used it for a couple of days. good job of protecting palm agains elements scratches, water spills etc, but hinders my access to my palm, and so I went back to my old leather case that allows easier access, but without as much protection."
4,Thorough basic coverage,I have always enjoyed BTLS. I am excited that the BTLS education committee decided to split their focus into Basic and Advanced. An EMT-B can use the Advanced book for further knowledge about what their EMT-P's are doing (but obviously not for their own practice!). Both editions are well laid out with excellent notations and case studies. Worth purchasing your own copy if texts are provided to you.
2,A Disappointment,"After reading the reviews on this product, I decided to use my gift certificate on this. While the product suds up nice, the aroma some people brag about was not evident to me. The productly smelled faintly during use, but was not noticeable after use. Wasn't what I expected from the highly touted Philosophy line."
2,The best of who?,"First of all this is a two disc set containing 24 instrumental Sinatra favorites. Though professionally played by a Latvian orchestra, the arrangements are not that of such famed Sinatra arrangers, Nelson Riddle, Billy May, etc. The recorded sound is pleasing but some of the tracks are barely recognizable when compared to the originals. So all in all this experience is likened to a Chinese cook preparing an Italian dinner. Just so you know before you purchase."
4,Beutifully Nostagic and Relaxing,"I recieved this cd and have since listened to it in the car at the office and even bought a copy for my neighberhood Italian resturant. It's happy, non-intrustive and a suprise to everyone that hears it. It's probley great for old time dancing and Sinatra themed parties. Love it."
3,Songs of the sourdough,"Was expecting a book,what I received was copies of pages copied from a library book and reproduced as a booklet, Very cheaply made. product."
5,A Great Book,"As a poet myself, I can only stand in awe of the work in ""Island of Lost Luggage."" Janet Mc Adams is a major talent. I've turned my initial envy of her gift into a goad to write better and wider myself."
4,Not What I Expected,"I thought COPENHAGEN was a great play, and I picked up thisbook thinking it was background for the play (the bookjacketgives some hints that that isn't the case, but I didn't botherto read that. Anyway, it turns out to be less than that, andalso much more. I was sucked into the mystery along withMichael Frayn, and read it in one sitting (it's short). Ihighly recommend it for pure entertainment."
2,Don't bother,A bad hoax and a book that probably shouldn'thave been written.It does no one proud and is pretty much a waste of time to read.No one but a famous man could get trash like this published.
2,"If you know the work of the editors, nothing to see here","A disappointing book that I picked up for the essays by Parry (liberation theory) and Brennan (a curious ""alternative history"" of postcolonial studies), which were OK but not fantastic, and overall the book is dominated by straw-man arguments about postcolonial theory, squarely located within European epistemology. The introduction, ironically, suggests that ""there needs to be a productive dialogue between Marxism and postcolonial studies"", yet the examples of postcolonial studies mentioned in the book, such as Spivak, have of course given serious and detailed readings of Marx that are not taken particularly seriously here. More to the point, the entire tone is one of ""debunking"" and not at all exciting. If you're grumpy with all those postcolonial theorists supposedly taking over everything and you want to have arguments with them, or just make yourself feel better about liking your Adorno books more, this might be useful to you."
5,"A quality product, still made in USA","I had a Harbor Freight China made knock off of this drill to use in my retirement, building a lake home. The China made one has a slip clutch,(un-advertised) two times it de - activated for no reason. After being repaired two times and then fail again it is now in the trash. This Milwaukee has a 5 year warranty. It has lots of power, so read the instruction manual, use the supplied pipe handle for leverage and THINK when using this very powerful tool."
1,24 Years Old and Still Losing Teeth,"I have recently switched from the DeWalt Timberwolf to the Hole Hawg because my friends told me to. I have since hung it up and lost two teeth and fell off my ladder. I thought this thing had a safety clutch like the DeWalt. Also, I can't get any leverage with the short body of the Hole Hawg. I am going to lose the Hole Hawg and keep my remaining teeth."
3,Lots of crop circle photos,"This is not a documentary, this dvd is a lecture by Colin Andrews, leading expert in the crop circle field, who throughout the lecture gives us a history lesson on the phenomena. A few interesting stories are also told for the first time. There are hundreds of images and film footage shown throughout the lecture, this is a must for crop circle enthusiasts. This lecture looks like its from the late 90's. Very annoying that there is no mention on the back cover that this dvd is a lecture, Waterfall home entertainment, shame on you.The transfer is very grainy when you see Colin in the lecture theatre, but when it switches to images or film footage, the transfer is very good. I think this is one of the reasons why there is so many photos of crop circles throughout this program. Audio is PCM stereo. Plain menu screen, extras, there is a photo gallery which has 39 photos of crop circles. Running time 64 minutes. Transfer 2/5, audio 3/5, extras 2/5."
1,Stop her before she punctuates again.,"This book may have some interesting comments, but is so badly written that any valid points are lost. It is apparently unedited, there are many errors in grammar and usage. The exclamation point is used as often as the period.Any information gleaned from this book comes at such great effort as to not be worth it. One must also get over a dislike of the author, who spends many pages whining about her childhood. It may have very well been horrid, but I can't tell from this writing.A real chore to read."
1,pitiful,I'd give this a minus 10 for preposterous. Whoever wrote this still believes Jim Jones was a good man who was done ill by those who fled. Its one of the most ridiculous pieces of trash I've ever read. I'd suggest folks who want to learn about the facts get on google.
2,Interesting but very confusing,"The author states that it had been predicted that no one would understand her. I am afraid I am one who does not. The book contained some interesting insider details of life in the cult, but the authors analysis was confusing and far fetched."
1,Ludicrous,If you want to read a story by the madman himself--this is it. The author seems to believe the pyschopathic leader still speaks through her. This is a poorly written self promoting piece of trash by a a very sick mind.
1,Scary and disturbed,"This is a poorly written and very disturbing book that shows the end result of mind control. The author still believes Jones was a ""messiah"". She still believes that ""government"" forces did the killing at the Port Kaituma airstrip. She believes all was great in Jonestown until the Concerned Relatives and the ""media"" stuck there nose into it"
1,"AWFUL, MINDLESS, Jones incarnate",What a joke. Can this person really believe that Jim Jones is Godly and continues to live?
1,Gag me,"How in the hell did this get published? Sad commentary on someone existing, barley, with their EYES WIDE SHUT."
3,Good print quality - But pricey,"With the cost of printers coming down, it would make more sense to buy a new printer that gets a better Cost-Per-Copy (CCP) than it is to buy OEM brand ink cartridges. Lexmark cartridges do not like refills - the quality is heavily degraded when doing so."
3,Lexmark #83 Color Cartridge,"Other than the fact that it looked like someone just sent the item from their home in a used gift box, it was intact and was the correct number cartridge as advertised."
3,Not exactly as described,Poor quality. Was supposed to be OEM but was remanufactured instead. Will be more careful next time with purchase. Bad choice.
1,Don't waste your money! Horrendous,"I don't usually write negative reviews ... I just don't write anything at all ... but this product is SO BAD that it deserves a really bad review. FIRST PROBLEM: it is supposedly low in carb but it takes a stick of butter and a mountain of heavy cream to make it. Huh? Low carb but heart attack fat? YUK. SECOND PROBLEM: it is very difficult to make - it has three different bags, needs three bowls, lots of measuring, lots of utensils, lots of work. It would have been less work to create from scratch. THIRD PROBLEM: it did not create a ""jelly roll"" type item - it created a big gloppy sticky mess that was difficult to work with. FOURTH PROBLEM: It did not come out like a roll; it came out like a biscuit or a scone. Just a baked glob. FIFTH PROBLEM: it tasted LOUSY. Just plain lousy. Not even the pecan topping tasted good.Don't waste your money on this mess. This is the second one of the Dixie Low Carb items I've made and each one is worse than the next. Don't bother."
4,do you 'get' it?,"because at first, i definitely did not! i reviewed this album a couple of years ago, giving it only 1 star, (harsh, i know), when i should have really given it a few more listens. just recently i re-discovered this album, and let me say that it is just about as great as anything they've ever done. as always, fun is the first and last subject when it comes to the adicts, and on rollercoaster, nothing has changed. the only real low point on the album for me was the song ""daydreamers night"" which should have been an eagles song."
1,Rollercoaster,"This Cd sucked!!!!`Its nothing like viva la revolution,Joker in the pack,or smart alex. Dont get this cd !!!!"
2,thanks but no thanks,"I browsed through this book the other day at a local store. While I have to admit I only gave the new D and D system a once over, I feel this book is not for experienced players. It's oversimplified and bends (or breaks - see the new rule about which races can be paladins) the structure of the game. I liked the structure of the 1st and second editions (which ultimately were not that unrelated); game systems are meant to be a fairly strong, but flexible, guide to the game you're playing, not ""well, since you don't like rule A, buy this new book and you'll never have to worry about rule A again! "". That is a total lack of imagination on the player's part. I don't want to be too harsh though; if this is your first foray into D and D and roleplaying, give it a shot. Hopefully, though, you'll graduate to the better, earlier D and D systems eventually."
1,Not This AD&D Fan's Thing,"Perhaps being a bit ""old-fashioned"" I am not a big fan of Third Edition. While I will agree that the new Player's Handbook is beautiful and well presented as a book, I generally do not like the 3rd Edition game for several reasons. Mainly, I think that it makes characters a little too powerful. I can understand adding some power to a few classes to spruce them up, but allowing ability scores over 18? Adding a point to scores of your choice to the tune of 1 point per 4 levels? Perhaps the biggest thing is the less than smooth transition of existing characters into 3E and the fact that all of my old gaming supplements don't easily translate. As for the book, the biggest annoyance that i have is that the spells are listed alphabetically, not by class and level. Perhaps that is a pet peeve, who knows. Anyway, I am sure that the new game will appeal to many people but I for one will stick to my old favorite."
3,Its still the same tired rule set,"under the gloss of the 3rd edition, its still the same tired, illogical rules. The original edition of the advanced rule set was much less complicated and did not pretend to reflect the complexities of reality. It was geared towards a cooperative group. This rul set seems to focus on the idea of the uber-character. They have taken the whole concept of classes about as far as it can. The combat mechanics are still extremely limited - the AC system is probably the worst armor system published for a role playing game. However, i do have to say that given the confines of the system itself, its pretty impressive. They have really pushed the system far beyond where it started, and it has come through it all more flexible than i would have originally guessed."
5,New Rules for classic game,"These new rules are great. The new game is easier for the new player to learn, and it's not yet (yet I say) cluttered up with too many, overly spicific rulings. The formulas for combat make it easier to find out if combat is going your way or not. Very different, but change is good. Right?"
4,"Well, not bad","I am what you might call a d and d newbie. When I got this book, i was impressed by all the pictures and stuff, but as I got into reading it is got kinda confusing. It tells you tons of information, and it gets hard to remember. I had to keep re-reading chapters to figure it out. Overall its pretty good, but could be better. If you are interested in playing D and D, you should buy it!"
3,"Nice on the outside, Not so good on the inside","This, very good marketed book, gives us the illusion of a better edition with simpler rules. The thing is the rules were simplified way too much. The new rule system has some good ideas in it, but the main concept of it was made for kids. Wizards of the coast have managed to make ""Magic"" out of D&D. With crazy combination possibilities and too generic system, the game just doesn't make sense at times (wizards and thieves require the same amount of experience! how can one expect to compare a 16th level wizard to 16th level thief??) I will not prolong here too much, since most of the things had been already said. all in all the book is nice, but we didn't find it too useful and we are back to the old system with some of the new ideas in mind."
4,A rose by any other name,"Ok, I was worried that WOC would screw it up. I have been an avid d&d'er since '80. I think that the new cover is the best part of the book. The insides are as different as 2nd was from 1st. Other than a few bells and whistles you still have ad&d as it ever was. The new features, rules, and changes seem to be taken right outta Dragon. If you are a real Dungeoneer you will probably say, ""whats wrong with the one I bought back in '82?"". The fact is things change and I bought the book because my game group will always buy the new books and play the new rules. Just bite the bullet and buy it, you know you want to."
2,Beware! This is Not 3.5,"Lacks the polish and balance of 3.5 DnD. Look for the newer, shinier 3.5 cover. Ex: Intuit Direction is a skill; with it you can determine which way is North... that's it."
4,Come on!,All I have too say is D&D has always been about imagination. How many of us have bent the rules to fit our gamimg world needs? I look at this book and I take the good to make gaming esier and clear. I take the bad and re-tool it to fit our gaming world as we see fit. This book is full of new ideas that we have all probably thougt of before why don't they do it this way or why can't I have an Elven Palidan he just as religeous as your Palidan. Overall I give it a 4 star rating because nothing is perfect. Don't forget to use your imagination and these 3rd Edition gaming rules can be just as fun. For you die hard fans give it a try before you knock it. Chris
5,How did that spell go?,"I've (don't reviews always start with ME?) been gaming since the 1st edition days. This is the best gaming system I've seen. THe combat is so fast, that its almost real-time. You don't need to be an accountant to hit an orc. I love it. There are a few stumbling blocks: its hard to find the actual combat tricks (ie, its not easy to find the bit that tells you exactly how to do a CHARGE), but once you flag the page, its a breeze. some of the spell-overlapping is not clear: you can't use a wooden sheild and a sheild spell, or can you?? I guess that's what being DM is about. This is a game system I'll use for years."
3,Newbies benefit most,"Having played AD&D for 20 years, here's my thoughts on 3rd Edition.The effect of abilities has been made consistent. A vast improvement over the arbitrary pluses and minuses in 1st and 2nd edition.Secondary skills have been made largely workable. Class restrictions are annoying.Magic is laid out strangely in the manual. It takes a bit to figure how it works now and where to really find stuff. Once you study it, it ain't that bad but study it you must.Dragons are way more dangerous now. 1st and 2nd edition players have to reset there expectations a bit regarding creature threats.Feats can turn anyone into a superhero. The weakest part of the system if you want the ""average-joe-who-can-make-a-difference"" to be portrayed.Beginners to RPG's will appreciate the hand holding structure 3rd Edition offers. Advanced folks are probably better served by sticking to what they have or adapting GURPS to their storyline."
4,"Another coffee, please...","I was sit in front of my fireplace when I received the package... when I opened the package I saw it: the new PHB for the 3rd edition. I started reading and after 5 or 6 hours i got realized of something: it is just great.It throws to trash the old-fashioned rules of THAC0 and similar . The system seems to be faster and it is really easy when you are an experienced player. This is also a little handicap for new players, because the rules could be a bit arcane; despite this, I'm still thinking the 3rd edition is a really good change"
5,i think its really good,"i love D&D. And i like third edition, it makes some things alot easier to understand"
5,Awesome!!!,I have read all of the old AD&D books and this really simplifies some of the confusing rules. It takes a lot of rolls and makes it easy to figure out. Highly recommendable for any level of user from novice to expert. Anybody that knows 2nd edition rules will appreciate it.
2,D&D for a new generation of players (buyers),"I must admit that I have been disgusted with the onslaught of books stamped with Second Edition. Falling off the shelves like overpriced amendments to a perfectly good constitution. It was about time they did what should have happened long ago, admit that the game has changed. Most people starting D&D in the past few years would have had to shell out about 200 just to get a peice of the full Second Edition Library. It is time to get back to basics, use fewer 'standardized' rules, and get the player's imagination back into the game. I would hope that those looking for a strong backbone to role playing will stick to the basic book(s), and use their own ideas to fill in the gaps. If you have them, stick to the old rules set in your old 1st and 2nd editions and save your money! This game is about a players ability to think. It shouldn't have anything to do with the amount of books you can buy. Save your money for miniatures and cool dice."
5,The next generation,"I have played/ran D&D, AD&D (1st Ed.), 2nd Ed. AD&D, and many others RPGs. 3rd Ed. D&D is another change similar to the others; some will like it, while some won't. I look forward to playing and running it.It continues the move away from instant character creation (although DMs now have computers for that), moving toward a skill based system. Non-weapon proficiencies and secondary skills have been replaced with a skill system. I am happy to see individual weapon proficencies go away.We'll have to see if Kits are still in D&D, although they shouldn't be since it now has a skill system. The magic system has some good changes. ""Feats"" have been added, which will please those who liked Skills & Powers. Also, the ability to raise ability scores will please my players.I will probably always prefer AD&D (1st Ed.) as my impromptu, deep plotting RPG, but Wizards of the Coast did a nice job."
4,D&D Updated...,"It has been some 25 years since Dungeons and Dragons first appeared. With the direction of gaming having changed drastically over the past 10 years, D&D had been left behind. Until now. The systems have been simplified and combined while still keeping the flavor of the original game concepts. There is truly something for all types of gamers in this book. There is story elements, advanced role-play as well as the simple hack and slash that has become the old standby."
4,a great leap forward,"the 3rd edition took a while to come out, and it was definitely worth the wait. i love how characters are so customizable now and the new systems make the game flow much better now. i can't wait for the dm guide and monster so that i can fully play a 3rd edition game."
5,The Best Just Got Better,"The new Third Edition Player's Handbook is excellent. The artwork and design are fantastic. The rule changes are all covered and explained completely. It includes diagrams of all the weapons and common items, details on most human deities and alignments, and updates for character classes and non-human player characters. Anyone that complained about the new edition rules before they were released will be pleasantly suprised. This book would be an excellent product at any price and a must have for all Dungeons and Dragons players."
3,"EXTENSIVE ERRATA, ABRIDGED GLOSSARY IN 1ST PRINTING!","If you haven't purchased this Core Rulebook yet, then I urge you to wait until later this year. All errata will be fixed, the unabridged glossary will be used, and new information will be added. The above does not change one fact, though. Third edition D&D is the best yet, great for experts and newbies alike!!! I'll give you my second printing rating right now: 5 STARS!!!"
2,What Might Have Been...,"Well, I'll say this, WOTC really cleaned up the D&D rules in 3e. There is no question that this is a much better game than previous incarnations of D&D. Having said that, WOTC really blew the opportunity to make this product more approachable for novice gamers. In particular, the rules on character creation are a mess! There is no clear, step-by-step procedure for completing this process - just a jumble of disjointed chapters containing related material. It feels as if no one took the time to synthesize all this information into a logical whole. 3e is a step up for experienced D&D players but I fear that it will only frustrate and discourage new players looking to take up this exciting hobby. All and all, a very average effort by WOTC."
4,It's really good,"I'm an old time gamer... I still own the D&D Rules cyclopedia, so you can imagine how resilient I am to change. But, since i had this book in my hands, my game has totally changed. First, The game is now FAST, a combat can be resolved in less than 15 minutes. Not only the character creation and the rules are simplified, but the book itself is beatiful... I haven't seen this art since the D&D Gazeteers.Still, there are a few things that I don't like. For example, raising your abilities with level increase sounds ""Munchkin"" to me. So, I have personal problems with a few rules. That's the reason for not giving it the fifth star.As a Player and DM, I recommend this book as a MUST for every RPGamer."
2,The More Things Change,"As an older role-player, I find that I have a lot of experience with games that the newer generation of gamers don't even remember; games like Chainmail and the original Dungeons and Dragons. Many gamers view this book, along with it's counterparts the DMG and Mounstrous Manual, as a step forward. I view it as a step backward. It changed too much too quickly. I've heard younger gamers say that the system has been ""stream-lined for new players"", but I find that it's dull, less complicated and shooting for a lower target group. Perhaps I'm just getting older and am opposed to change, but I wasn't that happy with the 3rd edition rules. Give me the 2nd edition any day."
4,D&D IS BACK WITH A VENGENCE!!,I've been playing D&D for over 14 years and the new 3rd edition P.H. is a triumphant return to my 1st year of playing D&D when everything was a new experience and i had alot of fun playing the game.Gone are the somewhat clunky game mechanics of the 2nd edition and the return of some old favorites such as the barbarian and the monk although i must say that even the 3rd edition monk is an improvement over the 1st edition one.I'm also impressed w/the new race rules and i like the sorceror very much!!please give the game a try and i think you wont be disappointed.
5,3.0 is the way to go!,"3.0 is a great system at an affordable price! The rule variants are totally simplified, yet still elaborate enough to make for a VERY satisfying adventure that will leave players wanting more. If your looking for a great, affordable gaming expierience, look no further."
3,"Third Edition has players saying "" HMMMMMMMMM""","After the long wait for the new D&D third edition to arrive many players out there are saying ""HMMMMMMMMMMMM."" I must say the reworking of the game has some definate cool ideas and other areas leave me saying ""why change that?"" All in all the new Players Handbook is an atractive new edition to this classic roleplaying game. The art within is great and the price is right. I am looking forward to the new Dungeon Masters Guide which is needed before casting full judgement on this newly revamped RPG system."
2,Bad shipping,"Condition said ""acceptable"" but apparently that is a matter of oppinion... On top of that the bad shipping did nothing to help to the books condition (it was shipped in something that resembled a plastic bag)."
5,An excellent book by the wizards!!,"Monks, Wizards, Paladines, Barbarians and many other character classes makes this the best edition yet!! Sure, you could play these same characters in 1st or 2nd edition, but 3rd edition classes have been slightly altered to make adventure/role play more exciting and interesting. Each Character Class receives a class trait(s) per level and not to mention that abilities now go past 45!! The art is excelent and the character generation/skill points are much more realistic than the other editions. I don't want to give too much away, but I will add this....Third edition rules remind me slightly of 1st edition rules with some minor but ingenius alterations."
1,Dont judge a book by its cover....,"Boy is that ever true with the Third Edition Players Handbook! The great art stops with the cover of this twenty dollar waste. It can hardly be called dungeons and dragons at all anymore. I have written a full review of the book and I detail section by section all of the problems this book has. If you would like a copy of it just email me < arcanist@earthlink.net > for the gory details. If you want to read another brown nosing of WoC then read more reviews here, if you want the dirty low-down on why this was a waste of my money, drop me an e-line and get the full on flame of this piece of garbage. You will be lucky if you even get to see this review...its not good for sales."
1,Do not use this rules!,"I do not like the idea of priests having 8th and 9th level spells! I also don't like the heighten spell feat - this means that fireballs, lightningbolts even magic missiles can be cast at 8th or 9th level! My only hope now is that the 3e Monster Manual saves me... DM's everywhere I beseech you - DO NOT USE 3RD EDITION RULES!"
3,3rd edition... hard to understand,"I have been using the 2nd edition rules for a long time. I found the 3rd edition much more complicated than the previous one. I would like to begin using the 3rd edition, but I think I'll have to wait for some one to write ""Dungeons & Dragons for Dummies""."
5,Excellent and well made,"There is little I can add to the comments already posted. One excellent comment has described the major changes. Another commented on the excellent artwork. The one thing I can add is the extremely professional way in which the book is put together. To me, the best thing about this book is that they've eliminated much of the ambiguity that plagued the earlier versions. The new D&D team took great care to make sure that the same term is used for a given effect every time (and even provided a glossary), to cross-reference related rules from different sections, and to duplicate important material when it's applicable in multiple places.In all, this is the best edition yet."
2,Not for the AD&D fan,"This system shouldn't even carry the name AD&D. It appears that they have merged the FASA and Palladium sytems to appeal to the fans of these sytems instead of trying to rework the 2nd ed rules. It works as a stand alone system and would be ok if you don't know about the previous editions, but carrying the AD&D name is a mistake here. Everything has been reworked, and I mean everything, except for a few names. If you were a fan of the previous editions, stick with them, this is not the updated version you were hoping for. This is a different game."
1,This book rocks!,"To all the people who complained that this book was confusing and poorly written (Though I've only found one), I must say that you are in denial of this book's inherent greatness. This rating was given in order to attract your attention so that all those evil doers who think that they can knock the new rules will meet their end quickly.- A very satisfied RPG junkie who happened to be holding dice at the time this was written. (Not that keeping dice handy is a sign of insanity or anything... ((It's just good to have them close by in case you need to cast fireballs at people who treat your beloved literature so poorly.)))"
1,Gag me with a Kender Spoon of Turning...,"Good God! What's left to say? In the wake of a shaft-job and a money making scheme by Wizards, all I have to say about this AD&D farce is why not call it D&D for Dummies? Its a sad, sorry world."
4,An excellent addition to the D&D name!,"I've been an RPGer for sometime. I decided to pick up this book and see the new D&D for myself. This book is BEAUTIFULLY done. First of all, the book has excellent artwork and has been very carefully edited. Each page is in color and boasts a glossy finish. Physically, the high production value makes this one of the best (if not the best) made RPG books in my collection.The system is very solid. It still has the feel of D&D but I feel that it is much less cumbersome. The high quality shows that this has been heavily playtested. If you are familiar with D&D it won't take you long to learn the new rules.One final point, check out the price. Today, RPG rule books go for around $30-$35. This is only $20. If you enjoy D&D, do yourself a favor and pick it up!"
2,D&D on life support,"D&D is dead, and WOTC's 3rd edition of D&D is on life support. Granted the venerable game has become synonamous with role-playing, but the hobby has advanced tremendously since the 70's, and even this edition of D&D fails to reflect this. The new edition has a good system of character skills, and the new method of handling die rolls, particularly combat, is relatively streamlined and free of charts, which is always welcome. However, the major flaws of D&D are still there. It still relies on character classes (resulting in ho-hum generic characters), it still uses hit points (so after a few adventrues your characters will be wading through armies of orcs without a scratch looking for gods to kill), and it retains the numbers-heavy interest-light 3-18 scale for attributes. There are many good fantasy games on the market now, so if you are looking to make an investment for reasons beyond nostalgia, I recommend looking elsewhere."
3,Could have been better organized,"Well, I'm dissappointed in the layout and usefullness of the books (DMG, PHB). The rules are better, for sure, but almost impossible to read and find in these poorly written manuals. I'd be ashamed at the lack of clarity in this writing. Were there no editors around to check spelling, grammar and layout? These are supposed to be usefull game tools, not artisitc creations. Poorly done WOTC."
4,Not your father's Dungeons and Dragons,"At almost three hundred full-color pages, this new Players Handbook is a sight to behold, but the changes are not mearly skin deep. Wizards of the Coast set out to revive this twenty five year old game and they succeeded. Clunky mechanics have been replaced with an integrated skill system. The old version's ponderous combat system has been fine tuned to work better both with miniatures and without. Top it off with over a hundred new spells and this is the best version by far.The only things holding this book back from a five star rating are the occasional, but annoying typo, and the lack of much of the lightheartedness of the early edition, giving it a textbook feel."
4,she's better than.....,"first saw her in her MTV of this title and i think she's better than some of the pop princess in the pop industry!i'm not saying this because she's pretty, well, to be honest, i never into britney, just annoys me, i always look for unique and special, well, willa has done a good number, may be it's just the song itself but she definitely develop it perfectly, the remixes? well, sad to say this, i was actually giving a 5 stars for this single but the remixes just turn me off, the original will do and it's the best, may be better get her album instead of her single, well, personal opinion, no offense! tehe!"
2,remixes came too late to save the song,"First of all, like my title says, these remixes came to late for the club crowd. But, if you like Willa you'll be intrested anyway:1. Mike Rizzo Club Mix (6.39): Love this mix it speeds up the chorus vocals but keeps the verse vocals at almost regular speed. Really cool beat. Best mix in my opinion.2. Sal Parm {of Plasmic Honey}Club Mix (9.14): Sal doesn't do a very good job. The track is cool but the vocals are way too slow for the bpm (beats per minute). Same goes for his radio edit.3. Mike Rizzo Hyper Vocal Mix (6.09): Hyper vocal indeed. If I didn't know the words to this song by memory I wouldn't be able to understand the verses in this mix. They just go by too fast.4. Sal Parm Dub (7.14): Very, very disappointing. Usually, even when the mix is bad, remix artists have a chance to redeem themselves on their dub but not Sal Parm. I really expected better mixes form him.5. Sal Parm Radio Edit (3.59): See Track 2I'd give 3 stars but the mixes were too late."
1,This song BLOWS!,"What is there to say, other than that this song, and all the remixes, are awful. The girl CAN NOT sing!"
4,What Pleasurable Memories Are Here,"When I was young books were a bit short at my house. However, we did have a collection of medieval romances that I read and reread. When I recently found this book I was enchanted to see some old favorites here.Oh, yes, these stories have scholarly worth. But they also have the power to fire the imagination and feed the mind hungry for magic and adventure. Spend some time enjoying these tales before you study them!"
4,Excellent.,"I hadn't heard of the Court & Spark until I was given this CD to review for the college radio station where I dj. I imagine they're not the biggest band, but they deserve to be. Their sound is a mellow but driving alt-county. I don't know of many other bands who can create such powerful songs that are so subtle, not overwrought or bombastic. This record will grow on you, especially ""to see the fires"", ""rooster mountain"", ""national lights"", ""the lone palm"", ""fade out to little arrow"" and the last track ""in a sugarpine bed."""
5,alt-country for the new millenium,"I too received this album from my college radio station to review and was also blown away by this band. These guys have listened long and hard to the proto country-rock of the Byrds and Burrito Brothers and added a more sophisticated post-modern malaise to both the sound and the lyrics to produce music that is sometimes ... magnificent. I mean, some of these songs are just gorgeously epic, carefully building to crescendos and then winding down to finishes.I received several dozen CDs to review and this one (and one by Chicago's Fruit Bats) were the only ones to really stand out. There is a big river of dreck out there and it is wonderful to discover a beautifully translucent and transcendent freshet in the middle of it all."
1,stop,"alt country is no longer that, evidenced in the editorial review comparing it(C&S) to 60's and 70's Los Angeles. or maybe it is alt country in that it sounds nada like 50's nashville."
4,"Re: T. Warren ""thw420"" ""reviews","Before you take into T. Warren ""thw420"" reviews, take into account that he doesn't like just about everything he buys, which makes me wonder if he is the competition slamming other venders products.I discard everything he reviews.This Alpine unit is tops for a midpriced unti, and I have never had a problem with it."
3,ipod user,"We bought this unit to directly connect our iPod for play back. We installed it in a Honda CR-V with six standard speakers. The sound is great. It improved the sound in our original equipment speakers. I have no complaint about the sound. I am disappointed in the scrolling feature on the face plate. It is quite slow. We can not use the iPod to scroll. If we could scroll using the iPod, I would rate this unit much higher. The CD player works very well and improves the sound, too. The radio is excellent, too. Alpine needs to update the scrolling feature."
4,Valuable for its eyewitness testimony of Therese,"This 1957 translation of Sister Genevieve's memories of St. Therese by the Carmelite sisters of New York is valuable for what the older sister saw and heard of Therese. The tone is pious -- Therese is generally referred to as ""the Saint""--a nd a fresh translation would be most valuable. Lovers of Therese will be very happy to learn more about her. If you are not already a lover, start with another book. Be on guard that you are reading Celine's interpretation, which is valid as an interpretation by the ""sweet echo of her soul."""
5,Beautiful history and photographs,"Very interesting history of particular quilts during the Civil War. Many color photos of each quilt. Worth buying just for the beautiful photographs. After seeing the photos, the history of each quilt was just icing on the cake. Many of the quilts that were stolen or sold are traced to the original maker. Viewing what these Southern ladies made has inspired me to put more effort in my quilts!"
4,Good way to improve your game,Learning Tactics will help you win 90 percent of your games. I like this book because it covers a good variety of tactics ranging from forks to pins and more. Could probably use more problems but the problems it has are very good. [...]
1,"Extremely biased documentary -israeli version of ""Der Ewige Jude""","What can I say - a documentary from an organization that has only compassion for Israel's most radical enemies. Don't watch unless you want PA propaganda reminiscent of ""Der Ewige Jude"". Also doesn't aknowledge the centrality of Hebron in the Jewish religion. Btselem (Amalek) should be ashamed!"
3,Primary contributor? Certainly not Nina!,"Nothing special. Nina appears only a couple of times, no interviews. I bought it for the Nina's ""primary contributor"" note. Interesting anyway but not for Nina's contribution."
2,No Fine Print To Read,"Finally after looking for this film in its original language it came up on Amazon with English subtitles which could only mean ONE Thing!!!Quick.... add it to shopping cart and buy.the product arrived way ahead of the suggested deadline and I tore it out of its wrapping, so excited....only to find a very badly English dubbed German movie with English subtitles??????What the ****?Why can't Amazon clearly explain that the movie is dubbed in English?Is this not considered important?I realise that there are people out there that don't like subtitles...this would be equally important for them to know too.I purchased another dvd at the same time, expecting as advertised, the original language, and it too was dubbed in English.This will be the last time I purchase anything through Amazon.What a waste of time and money.No wonder people download movies illegally."
4,Teaching English to Somali Adults,"As an English teacher for Somali refugees this has been of great help. It doesn't always have all the words that we use in the US, but it does help me get the message accross. It has also has helped me understand their problems without having to always go to an interperter. It has alowed me to teach some difficult concepts when you are only panamiming. The students have really enjoyed me learnign their language. It gets me close enough to the correct pronunciation that they can correct me."
4,Basic Introduction,"This dictionary was written for the tourist rather than for a culturist but contains a good introduction to Somalian grammer, prounciation, travel phrases."
4,"a good tarot deck and system, but very complicated.","i found the faery wicca tarot deck and book an incredible deck. the art work is delightful and thought provoking, although the white blazes containing names of various characters portrayed therein are disturbing to the entire setting of the cards. i do not feel i could use these cards for doing readings for myself or others as the system is specific to the irish mythological cycles, and there does not seem to be a clear way to correlate the various cards with one another. however, i find that they are an excellent tool for studying and understanding the celtic myths, and for pathwork, meditation etc."
1,NOT THE REAL THING........,"Where do I begin? Shallow, pseudo-historical, rehashed, cobbled together stuff, this deck & book represent neither Wiccan nor Faery traditions accurately. I'm not sure what it is trying to be, maybe it isn't either.The pretty cards and page upon page of old Irish tales don't make up for the fact that there's nothing much of substance, or new, here....This Tarot set is a CLASSIC of garbled New Age nonsense, a real NEED NOT HAVE, and COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY to anyone who wants to work with the Faery.I am disappointed....."
5,My favourite Deck!,"This was a present and it has become my main deck. Perhaps people whom don't like it don't like celts either. It's very well thought out and the more you study it, the deeper it gets. The art work is gorgeous and the symbolism brilliant."
1,Do I have to really give it even 1 star?,"Besides getting the Irish spelling and words all wrong (makes you question the authority of the author), Ms. Yates work was the best part of the deck."
1,dissapointed,"I recieved this product and it was like the tube was empty. I had more mascara in my currently empty tube then what came in this ""supposed"" new tube. Very disappointing, waste of money"
3,Hard to grow,"It has been some time since I planted it, but so far it has not grown at all. I am fairly serious gardener, so I am a bit worried. Will update this review in a few months."
3,bought it for a special girl,"I bought this for a little girl that I mentor and I thought it would help her with her math, but she is not using it so I really can't review it"
3,Not one of the favorites,"It seemed like it would be a fun and educational toy but it is very limiting. Until your kids can do exponentials and other high order math it is very limiting. There is only so much you can do with add, subtract and multiply. I also like more practical games where the kids can relate what they are doing to something."
5,Math Dice -An easy trick to learn math!,"We got these for my son and he is learning and becoming proficient in his math facts.When it's a game, somehow they forget they're learning!!!"
2,"Good product, but ripped package","My son loves these dice and they are a very fun game for him to play (he's 8 yrs old), but the bag that came with them was ripped when we took it out of the package. So disappointing for a brand new toy to already be ruined before its even played with. :("
5,Great little travel game... and it's educational too!,"Math Dice is a simple idea: roll the 12-sided target dice and multiply them to get your target number, then roll the six-sided scoring dice and use them to get as close as possible to the target by using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division... and whatever other math functions you agree on in advance.Once you master the simple rules, the fun begins. Play at home or school, or in those pesky waiting rooms, planes, trains or automobiles, wherever you find a minute. You can even play solitaire. I carry the bag in my backpack for emergencies anywhere, any time!Race against your opponents, or set a length of time to make your calculations. It sounds much more boring in my review... just try it, you'll love it! Oh, and it's educational, too, helping kids master their math fact speed as well as teaching flexible thinking and number manipulation. Math can be fun!"
3,Okay if you like math,"More math than game, but it is good if your kids like math, it didn't hold our grandkids interest for too long."
5,Great Tool,"Used for the Phillips holding the brake rotor on a Odyssey, my impact driver didn't budge it, and it was starting to strip, used this hand impact tool, and bingo - it came right out. Use it for those fasteners that are rarely removed and that strip easily.. An ""old school"" tool that works better than many new ones of today."
1,Broke after 1st use,"""Tried"" to use it for the 1st time on 5/23/09 to remove 8 screws that hold the 4 brake rotors on a Honda Odyssey. 1st screw worked fine and the BIT BROKE ON THE 2ND ONE INSIDE THE HOLDER !!!!!!!!! NOT A VERY HIGH QUALITY TOOL."
2,Designed poorly,"This tool probably has some value for those instances when the impact required to remove a stubborn screw is not so demanding. But, I found it totally useless to remove a screw securing my Audi TT brake rotor. Because this is basically a broad handled screwdriver, the unit cannot be held solidly when striking the end. It automatically turns in your hand as it tries to loosen the screw. But, it is heavy. It'll make a nice boat anchor."
1,Too small for larger thighs,I wear a size 12 and the garter belt was way too big and the hose were too tight at my thighs.
2,NOT one size,"If you are tall like me, there is a good chance these will look a little ridiculous on you..... If you don't mind the garter being very low on your hips (or lower if you plan on moving at all), then these are very nice ;-)"
2,"Suzuki triples, not a lot of detail but probably just enough","My experience with the Clymer repair manuals has always been pretty much the same. They have just enough information to bail you out if you know what you're doing. I doubt a novice at motorcycle engine repair or rebuilding would be able to do a teardown and reassemble just using this manual. Still, it has useful diagrams, pictures and other information. Plus as far as manuals for bikes that old go, it's pretty much the only show in town."
5,Memorable Concert,"Saw this show live at Hibiya Park in Tokyo Summer of 1981. I was spending a week there on vacation from Hiroshima and was scanning the papers for a show. Knew nothing at all about Masayoshi Takanaka but since I was heavily into fusion at the time I went to the show. It was misting rain and they had a wide angle blue floodlight behind the stage that bathed the air over the audience's head with a curtain of light. The show was spectacular! The backup group was tight and you could tell the band was having a good time. Like another reviewer said, very reminiscent of Carlos Santana. I still have a virgin vinyl press of the concert that I picked up when I got back to base."
2,The Bee Gees minus Robin,"First Vince Melouney and Colin Petersen left the Bee Gees and now due to some kind of dispute,Robin Gibb left. Robin's departure was brief. He recorded his solo debut ROBIN'S REIGN while his twin Maurice and older brother Barry recorded this album. The title was first a track from the Gibbs' 1967 debut,BEE GEES 1ST. Robin returned for good,reconciling with his brothers to record the follow-up,2 YEARS ON. The only hit from this album is DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER which would appear on 2001's THEIR GREATEST HITS-THE RECORD. SAVED BY THE BELL from ROBIN'S REIGN appeared on TGHTR as well. I think this was the worst album of their career. If Robin hadn't quit,I'd think otherwise."
4,Japanese Track List,"Same track list of US version, no bonus track:1. If Only I Had My Mind On Something Else2. I.O.I.O3. Then You Left Me4. The Lord5. I Was The Child6. I Lay Down And Die7. Sweetheart8. Bury Me Down By The River9. My Thing10. Chance Of Love11. Turning Tide12. Don't Forget To Remember"
4,A lost Classic,"I had a copy of Cucumber Castle on vinyl when it was first released and found it a great departure from the ""norm"" of what the Bee Gee's were doing at the time. I have fond memories of events and places associated with each song. It feels nice to slip in the CD and go back once in a while with music of quality such as this , rather than some of the junk that is peing passed off as music these days."
3,You get what you pay for....,"Cambridge SoundWorks makes these relatively inexpensive speaker stands for their ensemble IV satellite speakers. They are adequate for the job, but less than desirable. The 31"" fixed height is shorter than the ideal height of speaker stands. Since most surround sounds pros advise speaker height to be at the level of one's ears when sitting, these stands fall a bit short of that. The stands are very simple in design: wooden base, metal pole which can conceal the speaker wire, a few screws that tighten w/ an allen wrench. I bought the Ensemble IV system b/c it was so inexpensive and I just started out in the surround sound experience, and I'm quite happy w/ it. However, I do wish these speaker stands were eaither fixed at a taller height, or even better, were adjustable."
5,Hilariously ribald!,The wonderful cast could not be more talented or charming. I am looking forward to watching & enjoying many more episodes!
5,Hot in Cleveland Season One,The reason I got this one originally was just to see how the show was. We don't get the show until really late so I can't watch it.It was worth the money. So good and love all the cast.
3,get rid of the canned laughter,I think I would enjoy this show but I hate canned laughter. It is like the producers think we don't know when to laugh. It is very annoying. My rating would have been higher if not for the cued laughter. I love Betty White but they need better writers. It seems like her talents are wasted.
1,Unwatchable,"I saw this set at my library and it looked interesting because I liked all the actresses in their previous shows. This particular show is awful. It has a ridiculous premise with unoriginal writing full of stale humor and stupid jokes. The problem is not with the actresses, but the writing is some of the worst ever on television. I'm amazed it lasted a whole season. I couldn't get past 4 episodes. I would have stopped at one, but I thought the actresses deserved a chance to see if it was going to get any better. It didn't. The only saving grace is that I didn't buy it."
3,"Not Bad... Not Great, But not bad.","It's Not Frasier, Golden Girls, or One Day at a Time (or even a Van Halen concert), But it's an OK series, and for prime members, it's free, so I can't complain. Now if they'd only get some free NCIS."
5,Always makes me laugh...,"Hot in Cleveland was a pleasant surprise. Every time I watch it, I forget about my bad day and just laugh. I just wish they would hurry up and get season 2 out on DVD!"
5,The younger Golden Girls,"Here's a series that ""had me at hello"". Some sitcoms take time to grow on me, but this was love at first sight. Each of the actresses is great in her role and the four of them together is my new favorite ensemble. I don't have cable TV, so I will be eagerly waiting to watch each season as it comes out on DVD."
3,hot in cleveland,I like the actors in this show .they are good to watch when you need a good laugh. but sometimes they go overboard
2,Love Betty,"I love Betty White, but the show doesn't interest me. We've watched a few of them, and have since let it fall off the radar."
2,All Star Team= not so hot,"Really wanted to like this show; love the 4 gals they brought together; Wendy Malik & Jeane Leves in particular from Frazier, and the amazing Betty White you figure it can't miss right? Well, you can. Its the typical scenerio, bring comedy 'All Stars' together and it SHOULD be awesome/hilarious, and it just isn't. Frazier, Just Shoot Me, and Wings were all 8--10 comedy shows in my book, but this new show rated at best, a '2' for me. So bummed! But just like when Kelsey Grammer went from Frazier to his next show ""Back to You"" (which I thought was hilarious but was a ""1 and done"" season follow up) it takes more than 'Stars' to make a great show. I bought this brand new and wish I hadn't--cause in a short time it will be for sale used on Amazon for less than half price cause its not very funny--that's my take."
3,Funny but predictable,"Betty White is hilarious in this show and makes it worth watching, otherwise it is predictable and has the typical canned laughter added."
5,utterly entertaining!,"love the show! Love Betty White! i hesitated with watching, as i think i need the physical product. i love the 21st century!"
5,Great DVD,If you love this show you can't get enough of it. To see episode after episode is a real Joy:)
5,Hot in Cleveland is Hot!,I love the ability to watch these shows on my Kindle Fire. I travel alot and the TV selection in the hotels is not always the best. The quality of the picture and sound are great.
4,Best Episode of Season 1,"This episode seemed much funnier than the rest in this season. I haven't watched all of subsequent seasons, but so far those weren't as funny as this one either. Overall, the show seems to lack something--more laughs, probably. Looked promising at first, but has become a boring chick-com."
2,Mean-spirited,"We seem to have mostly got past humor that belittles people of color, women, or gay people. But I guess it's okay to make fun of older people, and to do so by belittling them. 'What's your favorite medication?' says one older person to another. 'Better call him soon, since otherwise he's likely to be dead.' Etc.Ha ha. Not."
2,If you like the show...That IS ALL you get.,"Was very much looking forward to getting the show and the great extras (bloopers / Original Pilot / Vitoria's Lady Pants commercial / etc.) that are listed. Unfortunately there is NOTHING in the set except the 10 shows. I almost forgot there are a few trailers for other movies / shows from the EONE distributor. This is a bare bones set, good thing the show itself is fantastic."
2,HOT in Cleveland,Betty White is awesome - as usual! She just gets better and better! The other cast members leave MUCH to be desired. Sorry that I spent the money to purchase the entire first season.
1,Poor customer service and product,"Purchased "" Hot In Cleveland "" DVD. Everything came quickly. However, the DVD would NOT play----"" ERROR "" screen kept appearing. Apparently the DVD was not compatible with my LG DVD player. Tried viewing on an older DVD and 2 episodes played normally---then the DVDs froze up and would not play any further. I then contacted Amazon to explain the problem. I recieved the exact same DVD again and had the exact same problems. Now I have 2 sets of Hot IN Cleveland and neither will play on either of my DVD players. I've paid for these and now cannot get a hold of anyone in person to explain the problem once again--doing it with the computer didn't work. Not having personal contact with a human being has cost Amazon a future repeat customer. When all goes well with Amazon, I've always been satisfied, but when you have a problem satisfaction was lacking."
2,Too small,There was nothing wrong with these boots except they were a toddler size not a boys size. The seller needs to be more specific on sizing.
1,Terrible Boots!,"I purchased these boots in December 2010. Not even 30 days after purchase the zipper broke on one of the boots. I can't return to the store because they don't accept worn footware. We now have a $15 pair from Wal-Mart, no zippers. They work great!"
4,A Piece of Science Fiction History,"Orson Welles' famous radio broadcast of the War of the Worlds caused nationwide pandemonium when it aired just before Halloween in 1938. This book contains the original radio script, newspaper articles describing the pandemonium during and after the famous broadcast, and the story behind the story. The author of this book, Howard Koch, wrote the radio broadcast script, and went on to write the script to the movie Casablanca. This book is a treasure."
4,eucharist and church -- inseparable,"So much good liturgical theology brings in ecclesiology (I think immediately of Schmemann's Introduction to Liturgical Theology), and so much good ecclesiology hinges on the liturgy (I think of Ratzinger's Called to Communion). In Sacrament of Salvation, Paul McPartlan explains why. The liturgy and the Church are almost one and the same. If my conception of one excludes the other, I have an incomplete conception of both.The first millenium Church saw that the Eucharist makes the Church. In the second millenium, we forgot that, but knew that the Church makes the Eucharist. Both are true. Both make us.This is the wisdom of the Catholic faith. It is distilled and presented in a clear and stimulating manner in McPartlan's short book. I'm sure I'll refer to McPartlan's work for a long time."
3,It's good mascara,It's a good mascara. I usually don't get waterproof mascaras because they make the lashes really stiff but this is incredible because the lashes are still soft.These hold the curls really well but don't make the lashes voluminous or longer.Feel free to ask any questions!
4,very nice,i got it on the day it said it would be here it works really good makes my lashes super long. I've gotten compliments on the length of my lashes
4,second best,"the only mascara that is better than this one is colossal, glam black, from maybeline too... i love it so mich..."
2,Very disappointed with this mascara.,"I'm surprised about the amount of women happy with this product. I find it requires several layers and applications to be visible enough, it's not very waterproof at all and flakes off. Turns out spiky & gloppy bec. of the 2-3 layers required to see it. Never will I buy this again."
1,doesn't stay on for me,I've used the water proof mascara in the pink and green tube 4 ever. this doesn't cover well nor does it stay on. you can barely see I have anything on. the only plus is no raccoon eyes and it's gone by bedtime.
1,"Horrible, pulls out your Lashes even with eyemakeup remover",I would not use this simply because it pulls out your lashes and is impossible to remove. I used eye makeup remover as recommended. I still have it on my lashes after scrubbing it of with a cotton balls. My eyes are all red now. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!
5,A ROCK CLASSIC,"THIS CLASSIC U2 BALLAD IS MELLOW AND VERY GOOD TO LISTEN TO. THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT IS MISSING FROM MANY OF TODAY'S TOP BANDS. THIS SONG IS DEFINITELY ABLE TO APPEAL TO ANY ROCK FAN, WHETHER YOU LIKE PUNK, ALTERNATIVE, OR EVEN JUST HEAVY METAL, YOU'LL LOVE THIS SONG AND YOU SHOULD LOVE U2. A GREAT SONG FROM ONE OF ROCK'S ALL TIME GREATEST BANDS."
2,did not like,"i did not like this product at all. it didnt even exfoliat my skin, the beads in it dessolved way too fast to do anything"
4,sassy!!!,"What a great idea for a band...mix cool noisecore-ish music with wiseass lyrics about necrophilia, hookers, and being a rock star. Musically very solid...rhythm section is supertight...vocals are awesome...and the guitarists rarely repeat themselves. And to recapitulate every other reviewer's opinion...see ETID live. They are so damn hiliarious and rockin its unbeleivable. If you like Blood Brothers or Glassjaw you'd probably dig on this."
5,Last Night In Town - Every Time I Die,This is the way hardcore should be. Crazy and unpredictable. I suggest this cd for anyone who likes Eighteen Visions and Norma Jean.
1,Not true hardcore!,"This album sounds like Morbid Angel trying to do hardcore. There's not an ounce of punk rock in it, hardcore stands for hardcore punk and this isn't it. Even old school hardcore bands that utilized a hip hop or an metalish hardcore sound never sounded anything close to this. I wish people would stop trying to do pure metal and call it hardcore. For all these new school supposed hardcore bands just because you slam hardcore style, have a short-trendy haircut with dyed black hair and some african ear piercings doesn't make you a hardcore band."
3,Not Much Oktoberfest Music on this CD,"As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for CD's of good Oktoberfest music. This CD was disappointing because it contains only twelve selections, and a significant number of them are not really appropriate for Oktoberfest."
2,ONE OF HER WORST!,As a huge Diana Ross fan i have always enjoyed her albums and whilst some have been better than others there normally are a handful of tracks that i do like. However this album emerges as her most indistinctive work of the 80's. To be fair there are two great tracks that save this from being given one star- MUSCLES (written by Michael Jackson and a huge seller on both sides of the Atlantic) and I AM ME. SO CLOSE and IN YOUR ARMS are fairly good but the rest of the album is dreamy and ponderous. This was followed by an even worse album ROSS (1983). These are the only two albums of Diana Ross that i barley ever listen to. The soul seems to have drained from this album to a more light rock sound or in the case of FOOL FOR YOUR LOVE very heavy rock to which Ross undoubtedly has the vocal abilities to carry it through but is simply not the Diana Ross we all know and love. On the whole the album is mediocre with the exception of the few tracks mentioned.
4,Don't know if I can finish!,I'm about halfway through but I have become so angry that I had to put it down and switch to a book on herb gardening for a breath of fresh air.It amazes me that people can sink so low under the guise of being minders of the country's best interests. How do these people go to sleep at night?
4,Most Interesting Character is the Author Himself,"This book will provide some very enlightening insights into some of the characters still on the political right's stage. However, the most interesting character in the book is the author himself. I can't explain it here - you have to read it for yourself. At times I had to put the book down; the author is that unlikeable. I am glad I made it to the end however as some of the best material in the book is contained in the closing chapters."
1,you always have to watch out for those drawing attention to,"their own conscience! How exactly did David Brock pay for his own misdeeds? By apologizing (how does that make up for anything?), trashing all of conservatism as muckraking (as if this ONLY applies to the right). Is it any wonder that the liberal presses love this book?"
1,Not worthwhile reading,I found the book to be tedious and quite self-serving. Anyone who can shift to the extremes that Brock did/does is always suspect. Maybe he just needs to figure out who he really is and not try to write a book about it in the process.
1,Not really worth it,"I got about half way through this book and couldn't finish it. It'swhiny and, frankly, annoying. (...)"
1,Blinded by the Right,"It looks like you are having to give both this book and the Stupid White Men book away, not surprising."
1,Stupid book by an author who doesn't know much,What a book of lies. How can a person write a whole book based on opinion rather than fact. What a waste of time.
2,SELF-SERVING POMPOSITY,"Question: Who CARES what David Brock thinks? After claiming he lied in writing other books and articles, he has zero credibility now. He desperate need to purge himself of his past journalistic ""sins"" just so happened to coincide with a book contract? Amazing. And as far as I could tell, Brock spends a good deal of time bemoaning the politics of personal destruction, only to trash people who were once his closest friends--personally. David is smearing the right with the same vengeance that he smeared the left years ago. How is it relevant to his change of heart that Matt Drudge is of unclear sexuality? Or that Ann Coulter likes to smoke? Or that Laura Ingraham was once drunk with him in a gay bar? Answer: It isn't. A narcissistic screed by a man in love with no ideology or philosophy except ""Me, me, me!"" Obscene."
1,Where's the Beef?,"If half of what this guy says was true, it would be terrible. But the half-truths and outright falsehoods are too many to name. This book never made it into the top 5 bestsellers on the NYT bestsellers list, as Goldberg's book ""Bias"" did (how many weeks was it #1 bestseller?), and for good reasons. It made a big stir with leftists then dropped from sight like a lead balloon."
1,One writer flew over the cuckoo nest,"Those rah-rahing over this book might want to check out numerous columns online which are devastating to many if not most of David Brock's assertions. This guy apparently can't seem to tell the truth, ever, to anyone. He also recently was forced to admit that he'd been admitted to a mental institution in the recent past. We're talking rubber room, disassociation from reality stuff here, not depression or substance abuse. So, enjoy it as you might, beware of reading books that just tell you what you want to hear. They're fiction, as is, apparently, most of this book. Brock's ""conservative"" books were full of a lot of hooey, but this one is too."
3,Interesting mea culpa,"After hearing about this book a great deal from many people, I finally had to give it a read. What I got was a mostly well written account about how Brock gave the neo-con movement exactly what they wanted in terms of what can only be called propaganda. Brock does a good job in exposing the oft-ridiculed ""vast right-wing conspiracy"".But it makes a boring read at times, what with long lists of people and publications. And it seems just a bit self-serving at times, like he is trying to say, ""Oh, how bad I was to do all this, but I was very good at it."" And, after all, he does say exactly what I, as a liberal person, want to hear about those on the right who keep insisting that people who believe like me are traitors.I respect Mr. Brocks conversion to the left, and I like his work with mediamatters.org, but I am not sure I plan to read any more of his books."
4,Hall of Mirrors,"What keeps this book short of perfection is Brock's oblivousness to the past--his discovery of conservative hypocrisy is far from original--the 1960's brought us Robert Stone's ""Hall of Mirrors,"" the 1860's the writings of one Samuel Clemmens, and his inability to explain why seemingly normal human beings would choose to fill their hearts and minds filled with hate rather than love. (I'd like to offer the Stockholm Syndrome as explanation for the latter. One feels powerless to complain about the rich who can buy and sell us, so we save our epithets for those who would show us up by behaving decently. How else explain your own hatred of the inheritance tax--my apologies to those with estates in excess of a million who are affected by it."
3,From One Extreme to Another,"Mr. Brock's work shows the fickleness of modern politics...The only thing that matters to extremists on the right and left is finding material, irrespective of truth, that supports their claims...If you are an extremist on the left, you will feel vidicated. If you are an extremist on the right, you will feel betrayed. If you are an independent, you will laugh at both of them. Overall it's a fun book that shouldn't be taken too seriously."
3,"Can a Gonzo Journalist go ""Honest"" by changing sides?","OK. I'm one of those leftists who knew it all before Brock actually admitted it, so maybe this is sour grapes, but it strikes me that Brock's greatest success is the greatest weakness with the book -- he manages to convince the reader the truth never mattered to him when he was ""on a quest.""The end result is that, much as I want to believe the book represents an objective recounting of where he went wrong and the blind hate/anger of his circle of ""friends"" at The American Spectator, in the Arkansas Project and the right-wing law ""names"" like Olson and Starr and Silberman, in the end all I have is the sensation that he is still playing for the ""shocking"" -- just from the other side."
3,I Wish I Could Believe Him,"I don't doubt that there is the possibility of a right-wing conspiracy. I enjoy seeing people like Ann Coulter get trashed in print...to a point. I would just rather have the source of this information be someone with a bit more credibility than Mr. Brock.When all is said and done, one is left with the impression that the only cause David Brock truly believes in is David Brock, and that totally undermines his credibility. I would like to believe him...but his rather compromised background makes it impossible. The result leaves the liberal reader more unsatisfied than anything else."
3,"Lucky guy, this Brock","The most shocking thing about this book is what a weak writer Brock is. I've never read any of his previous diatribes, and thought I'd at least get an entertaining look into the Right with this offering. But long, ponderous paragraphs of stiff prose serve to prove only one thing: Had Brock not gone the ""way of the right,"" he would never have had a writing career."
4,A former whiner/hater/hypocrite gets honest,"An excellent book about the whiners, haters, hypocrites, liars, sociopaths, and psychopaths that made up (and still make up) the right wing conspiracy that hounded the Clintons and are attempting to turn back the 60s, from someone who was right in the middle of making up the lies and spreading the hate.And simply, elegantly told."
5,The ugly underbelly of conservatives in America,"This book exposes the real ""vast right wing"" network in the United States and the very dangerous threat that Bush, Cheney and their minions pose to real democracy."
1,The left is still blinded by the left,"Saying that the impeachment was just about a sexuel liason tells the whole story of the book and as a phrase a friend of mine once coined, The author ""located himself."" Bill Clinton was sued for sexual harrassment, a case in which he lost costing him a fine of $750,000.00 During the course of the prosecution Bill Clinton lied under oath some 3 different times. As a result of his perjury and the facts uncovered by investigators into the hidden life of Bill Clinton, he was impeached. Perhaps some of you remember many in Congress, Democrats along with Republicans, who stated that if the Senators would read some of the depositions held as evidence over in the Ford Building it would change their minds on whether to continue with the impeachment. Neither of the parties that were Senators bothered to look at that evidence as did both parties in congress..."
1,More illogical garbage from liberals,"If there is one constant in American life today, it is that the liberal ""thought process"" is so verily based in lies, half-truths, and spin, all for the goal of advancing a political agenda that pays only lip service to the idea of freedom, while working to advance a more sinister agenda of government control over those who actually make this country work. Liberals believe, directly or indirectly, in the tyranny of the inept. I suggest anyone who reads this garbage from by David Brock, read a more balanced view from Ayn Rand, such as Atlas Shrugged."
2,"Actually, rather silly","David Brock is an overly sensitive child who is out of his element in the harsh world of politics. He just can't stomach the idea that a party loyalist would actually use potentially embarrassing information against a political opponent. Every few years, when the controversy gets too intense for his poor little sensibilities, Brock throws a Jim Jeffords sized temper tantrum and jumps political parties, but unfortunately for lil' Davey this is only a temporary, unsatisfying solution. So you Democratic party clowns shouldn't get too excited, after he has becomes nauseous from a ride on the Clinton-Carville-Begala spin machine Brock will come crawling back over the fence with even more whiney vitriol."
1,"Nice try, but...","Brock wouldn't last 5 minutes in a debate with someone like Bernard Goldberg, Brent Bozell, or surely not Rush Limbaugh. He turned over when he interviewed Hillary Clinton and she put on the ""mother"" act with him, turning him to a pile of confused and adoring mush... For one thing, Anita Hill's mental problems are documented, and she lost any credibility she ever had long ago. If anyone could get her hooked up to a polygraph for about 10 minutes this matter could finally be put to rest, but that's never going to happen. She may be crazy, but she's not stupid...I'd love to see some enterprising psychoanalyst do a paper on Brock and Ariana Huffington. I'm guessing they have similar idiosyncracies when it comes to principle and self-delusion..."
1,Sad Little Story,"I'm amused once again by this attempt at justifying the misbehaviors of the democratic party.I purchased this book to,hopefully,gain insight into the mind-set that the ends justify the means!What a waste of time! The democratic party(Let's just openly say the words!)sells snake oil and promises! If the last presidency had been able to,I am positive it would have used communism as it's scapegoat! This story is laughable....."
3,Pretty good dish,"This book has lots of good dish about conservative talking heads. And it's an interesting look at the internecine warfare going on between conservatives and liberals. The problem with Brock, though, is that he seems to be unable to grasp that Anita Hill and Paula Jones might both be telling the truth or that Clinton and Clarence Thomas might both be lying louts. Toward the end of the book you find out who's pulling the strings now: Clinton apologists Joe Conason and Sid Blumenthal. I guess I'd recommend a buy: I'm so mad about what the right did to Anita Hill, I want Brock to have the dough just to get back at them. If you don't share my rage, get it out of the library."
1,"A Liar says ""I only tell the truth""","What's the point?...he never was conservative: ""EastBay Express, which says its investigation also revealed that no one else noticed any change in Brock's views and that the publication he helped start was not conservative and was a newspaper not a magazine.""Even liberals don't believe it:......quote Tim Noah from ""Slate"" magazine. Tim is hardly a member of the right-wing conspiracy. He says, I'm quoting now, ""This book is terrible, whiny, histrionic, and so factually unreliable that I gave practically gave myself a migraine trying to figure out which parts of Brock's lurid story were true and which parts were false.""It appears he'll say anything for money and make it up as he goes along. It calls into question his prior works but also his repudiation of his prior works."
3,Tales From The Dark Side (An Independent's Review),"Once again Brock shows that it is always popular (and profitable) to sling mud at whichever party happens to hold office at the time. Like other books Brock has written, ""Blinded by the Right"" is long on accusations and short on facts. Brock admits he lied for the Right. No doubt that the next time a democrat holds the presidential office, he'll write another book admitting how he lied for the left. While well written, ""Blinded by the Right"" would be better suited in the check out isle next to the tabloids, or on a shelf in the ""fiction"" section."
5,I can't praise this book enough,"I have only read 50 pages of this book, but I haven't been able to put it down from the moment I began reading it. I won't even try to praise it - just buy it. How any thinking person can support the radical Right (who have taken over the Republican Party and now control the Whitehouse and Congress) after reading this book is beyond me. It's as bad as you suspected, and more, and all documented by someone who was there. When you're finished reading it loan it to friends. It's the best book on the political scene that I've read in a long time."
3,Redemption?,"Brock's novel is pretty interesting if you are into your political ideology. It shows how someone who was once conservative decided to change sides an ideology. It could happen to anyone. By reading the book it makes you think about your political lining and if it is really what you believe in. My one problem ( one that has been seen before) is the lack of a bibliography. Brock makes quotes without citing them. A good political read, but nothing special."
4,It worked for me,"After having read a good number of books in the ""Franken vs. O'Reilly"" genre, I found Brock's book engrossing not just because of the politics involved, but because the story seemed so deeply personal and honest. I couldn't put it down."
1,Another Bust for Brock.,"David Brock churns out another pile of trash in his newest book ""Blinded By the Right"". He continues to prove that he is nothing more than a glorified tabloid writer. The author of ""The Seduction of Hilary Clinton"" tries to convince everyone he is only out to clear his conscience and uncover the conspiracy being run by the conservatives. This quite apparently never would have happened if he couldn't make money out of it. He didn't have a conscience when he blatently concealed information in the Clarence Thomas sexual harassment fiasco, and certainly hasn't gained one now. Seizing the oppurtunity, Brock further proves that he should be writing for the National Enquirer, exposing FAKE scandals, since he has so aptly proven his ablility so far."
2,Eh..........,"There is no reason to believe that Mr. Brock is any more truthful and honest now than when he was working for the ""other"" side 10 years ago. It all appears very self serving to me, and some reviewers have said that many of his facts in this book are just as iffy as in his earlier tabloid publications.It would be a much more effective, interesting and enjoyable read if Brocke in this book stuck to politics and journalism, and did not turn this all into some type of pop-psychologico journey for personal identity salvation. Also, for someone who has as much media clout as he has, and who seems to have a commercially succesful writing career yet in front of him, the lack of reflection, thoughtfulness, and general intelligence is disheartening."
1,Foolish,"Well, I have to say that the essence of liberalism is captured in this diatribe of hate and self-loathing. Preying upon the emotions of the weak and destitute and those that feel like outsiders in an attempt to ignite American class warfare by oversimplfying fundamentally complex issues is very dangerous to our society. Read this book if you want better understanding of the caustic machines called leftism and socialism. For enlightenment, I would suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Conscience?,"Mr. Brock seems to have found one at last. His autobiography is well-written, and I would assume mostly true. If not, he would have been looking at several law suits by now. He does not pull punches and accuses Clarence Thomas, among others of barely and il-legal maneuvering to keep the Republican hold on the courts and politics in general. Makes me damn glad to be a Democrat.The ""right wing conspiracy"" to bring down Clinton may not have been huge, but it was certainly effective; and Mr. Brock was a player in the bizarre actions by leading conservatives for quite some time. Of course, Brock is best known for his books on Anita Hill and Hilary Clinton. When he didn't do the hatchet job his right-wing buddies expected, they cut him loose. Now, he has come out of the closet both sexually and politically. He currently (as of this writing) lives happily in the DC area with his dog.Just one thing ... Gay conservatives? I don't get it. Do they disapprove of their own lifestyle?"
5,Great Book,"If you want an honest sincere book, written from the bowels of the Right Wing Conspiracy, this is the one for you. It tells of the techniques the Republicans use, trying to catch the president in a lie about sex, which was generally the plan all along. If you are truly a liberal, unlike some of the other reviewers listed on the ""A"" list, you will like this book, and you will get many of the details of the conspiracy and the big money spent to catch Clinton, and expose what should have been his private life. One warning, you need to have a dictionary handy. I feel like I have a good vocabulary, but Brock was pulling words out I'd never heard before. Some conservatives have trashed the book, as he isn't their willing lackey anymore, but it rings as not just a true confession of the author, filled with regret, but an accurate accounting of what really transpired. Get it, read it."
4,"""Blinded by the right"" exposes the truth","David Brock has written a book that gives the informed reader the truth about the ""right-winged"" agenda - religious and polictical. I applaud Mr. Brock's courage in exposing the lies, slander, name calling, etc. that is so ingrained in that agenda. Hillary Clinton was right in calling it a conspiracy. And if I had read no other book but this one, I may have been skeptical and distrustful of Mr. Brock. But I have read other reliable, truth-speaking publications that have led me to believe that the Christian and polictical right will use any means to achieve their purposes. I am glad that David Brock has removed the ""blinders"" from his eyes."
4,Bonjour Tristesse,"Most readers are likely to either applaud or disparage David Brock's book, Blinded by the Right, according to their own preconceptions. But it impressed me in no greater way than as a note of tristesse (sadness). Any joy gotten from reading about the bashing of the Clinton-bashers is less to the point than that their bashing turned the American mainstream media from responsibility into a state of tabloid mentality.Brock has at least made the rare move of admitting he was wrong. His whole adult life appears to have been a lie, and he undoubtedly has much company among other budding and corrupted journalists. His story is an object lesson illustrating the word ""mumpsimus"", defined by the Oxford English Dictionary; it is essentially a belief or believer in a notion or concept proven to be incorrect or unreasonable, or an ignorant or bigoted opponent of reform. The book may or may not be a revenue source, but it is certainly a mea culpa of the first magnitude."
2,"No Thank You, Sir.","I must admit that it was fun to read a bit of dirt on people as repugnant as Anne Coulter and Newt Gingrich. But the fun wore off when I realized I was just reading a left-wing version of the same sort of low-brow tripe that currently infects conservatism political ""thought"".Mr. Brock's epiphany has come conveniently late. He and his ilk have already mananged to dumb down the discourse on one side of the political aisle, and now it seems he'd like to expand the franchise to the Democratic side. No thank you, Mr. Brock.If I'd wanted to read books filled with pseudo-political drivel written by un-journalists of questionable ethics, I would've become a Republican."
5,Buenos Zapatos para dama,"Excelente Producto, recibido sin problemas en mis manos. Buenos colores y buen precio Gracias por el servicio y por buen producto."
2,nice shoe but to small,"I have to say this upfront. I am 6'2 and ordered a size 12 wide. I have very unusual feet. Very high arches is just one problem. Even though the shoes are marked wide, they narrow the front of the shoe when, to me, they ought to let it be a little wider at this point and then taper it down. It would make it easier for we girls with big feet to find shoes which would fit better.I could not get the front part of my foot in the first shoe out of the box. To me, shoe manufacturers forget we now have ladies in the 6' to 6'7 heigths which means the size twelve they are used to making probably will not work with these taller ladies.All the regular size[under 5'11]women I bowl with, really love the Dexter shoe. In fact I would say over 90% wear them.I bought a pair of Dexter mens shoe at one of the large named sport stores. They are comfortable.Rachael"
2,Shoes are extremely small,"I bought these bowling shoes for my mother and she said they feel about 1 size smaller than any other shoe she has ever worn. Extremely tight. The shoes look nice but if you can't wear them, they are useless."
4,womens dexter bowling shoes,my wife loves these shoes but we had to return them as they seem to run a little small on my wifes feet . she loves the look and style of these dexters but needed to up the size by 1/2 size .
4,Bowling Shoes,This shoes are really comfortable and made with soft material. The product is very well made and a perfect fit!
4,Mother loved the shoes.,"My mother wanted these bowling shoes for Christmas. She tried them out, and they fit perfectly and were comfortable. She was very happy with them."
1,bad,it was small bad quality and for 32$ it was awful i am not satisfiedi want 2 exchange but i cant
1,The size is way off,The first pair I ordered after using the recommended process turned out to be to small. So I returned and order a 1/2 size larger and they were too small as well. I believe the shoes have a serious flaw and you can not rely on getting the right fit.
1,The listing/product was incorrect,"The bowling shoes I ordered were not the correct size of US Woman's size 7.5. Thebox it was shipped in was originally labeled US Woman's 8.5. However, that was not the problem. The shoes themselves must have been labeled incorrectly at the factory. They were much TOO small. I have since purchased a size 7.5 Woman's from another online vendor which fit correctly. My true problem is that I spent about $20 shipping to receive and send back the incorrect shoes."
3,Classy Coffee Table Book,"Nice photography--examples of what architects can do for people with plenty of money. The adaptations are ingenious but provide little inspiration for Spanish-style homes of 1200 to 1600 square feet, for smaller families or retirees, which is what this reader was looking for."
3,Nice reference guide,I enjoyed this book but it was 1st published in 1996 so it is a little dated. I think Diane Keatons book is probably more current
5,Casa California: Spanish-Style Houses From Santa Barbara to San Clemente,Ideal for learning about the architecture and decortating styles of Spanish style homes. The photgraphs are beautiful. I will rely on this book when I design my new home.
2,TV programs,A 300 word review of a choice of TV programs as listed World in action. Changing room. BIRDING WITH BILL ODDIE.
5,"Get comfortable, you will not be able to get up!",One of the best books I have read in a long time. Could not put it down. I have always thought I could figure out the plot. Not this time. Hope to see more from the author real soon.
4,Great book - but here's an update!,"This is easily the best Kaua'i hiking book - buy it if you intend to do any hiking on Kaua'i. A small nit, the information on the Alaka'i Swamp Trail is out of date. This trail is now boardwalk right through to it's end at the Kilohana lookout (an amazing feat of engineering!). Far from being the endless slog through inhospitable ""telephone pole bogs"", this hike is now a snap, rewarded by an awesome view of the whole NE quadrant of the island from the edge of the Wainiha Pali (weather permitting!)."
3,good information but not well organized,"Has good detailed hiking information, but not well organized. Book is essentially a list of trails. Trails in same area tend to be grouped, but there is no real breakdown by area to give a better idea of choices and how hike routes could be put together by combining connecting trails or to help choose hikes by by area. The information is there, but you have to work to sort through it and make your actual plan. Improves upon a key flaw of Robert Smith book(s) which is poor directions to finding hike starting points (except where does things like tells you to refer to #92, and #92 then refers to #85), but would recommend it more as a supplement than a substitute."
1,No longer useful,"This book may once have been useful, but we found it outdated to the point of uselessness. Some of the trails described no longer meaningfully existed as such, and one was a dirt road with a heavy 4wd traffic. After having been mislead one too many times, we abandoned this book completely and relied only on the trail descriptions inThe Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed (Ultimate Kauai Guidebook). That said, we looked to this book only for hikes, not beach walks and the like. It may be that it is a very competent guide for strolls. This book doesn't describe that many more hikes than the Ultimate Guidebook does, but the way some trails are broken into several hikes makes it seem at first glance that it does."
4,Packed with great info,Great Little book packed with detailed and very useful info. I should never get lost again hiking on Kauai. Mahalo.
2,Confusion in Kauai,"A poor choice ;rambling with very confusing maps and directions.We have been to the island several times; the book does not reflect our experience.While we have no doubt the author is quite familiar with the trails, the clarity did not come through in the book."
1,book was a disappointment,We left it at the condo. We were disappointed in this book. Directions were vague. Not a good resource for Kauai hiking trails.
5,Kaua'i Trails,This was one of two books we used while hiking Kauai. The description of floral and birds one might see on certain trails was extremely good. Since we are birders this was very beneficial. Excellent text and very detailed.
2,Interesting but Almost No Overlap,"The ideas and systems in this book are cool, but they add very little to a traditional DnD game. The mechanics aren't too complex, but they are unusual enough too be more effort than they're worth. Further, the classes aren't well balanced - usually tending toward weakness. Most of the abilities could easily be mimicked with a magic item."
3,Quick but Fair Review,"Overall I think this book is squarely in the mediocre area. Which is unfortunate. WotC has finally come up with a magic mechanic that is interesting, easy to use, and unique. I'm a long-time fan(atic) of psionics, but the system is very close to the existing magic system.So ok, the core mechanic is great (IMHO) so what makes this book less than great? All the names of the abilities, feats, etc, seem really cheesy (psycarnum blade? really?) and drum the blue theme to DEATH. The new races summarily suck.In short, there's enough here to spark the imagination, and it's worthy of purchase...IF you can get it for less than the ridiculous $35 pricetag."
2,Ouch,I've had this book for quite a while now. It's not yet seen any use in our game. I thought for sure this would be a useful resource...boy was I wrong. Ouch and ick.
1,Waist of time and money,"I have bought every hard back book that came out for D&D, AD&D D&D 3.0 and 3.5 by TSR/WOTC and this book will soon be joining the few that were not worth keeping and even just for the fun of just reading. I just wanted to worn the other people out there not to waist there money."
3,War time propaganda,Movie was made to re-affirm Philippine-American post WWII special relations even at the expense of exploiting Philippine nationalist history and produced by Hollywood under the auspices of Office of War Information.
4,Good,I was dissappointed that i only got 2 john wanye movies from this. Dont get me wrong the movies are good. Perhaps i should have looked closer at the movies actors next time.
3,A so-so Hollywood war film...,"A hearty, but hamfisted, formulaic WWII propaganda film about the liberation of the Phillipine Islands from the Japanese occupation, loosely based on contemporary history. Future McCarthy snitch Edward Dymytrk directs; a handsome young John Wayne is the white guy who organizes the guerilla resistence, and Anthony Quinn is cast in one of his many ""ethnic"" roles, as the grandson of a legendary Filipino political figure, who is now called upon to lead their people to freedom. Although there's plenty of ""good neighbor policy"" talk about the nobility and can-do spirit of the Filipino people, this jingoistic, bluntly-scripted film is mostly pretty patronizing... And of course, the ""Japs"" are just pure, conniving evil. The script is pretty action-packed, though... if you like shoot-em-ups, this is OK, if you don't think too much about it. Really nice B&W cinematography."
2,Really just casting a vote,"4 movies in 2 wars all set in the Pacific.The reasoning in my opinion:Destination Tokyo 5 out of 10 - Cary Grant, John Garfield in a submarine destined for Tokyo in 1941.Back to Bataan 4 out of 10 - John Wayne coming back to lead the Filipino resistance.Bataan 3 out of 10 - Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan fight a losing battle so John Wayne can return.Green Berets 0 out of 10 - a John Wayne Vietnam propaganda piece that is a bad movie as well. It's cowboys and indians, white hats vs. black hats - reality was nowhere that simple minded. So bad I sometimes had to laugh to keep from crying. Roger Ebert probably thinks I'm being kind, I think he gave it 0 stars as well.Average 3 out of 10 or 1.5 out of 5because only the Green Berets drives it down,I went with 2 stars."
2,World War II?,"The Green Berets takes place during the Vietnam War, not WWII.Apparently not much thought when into these ""classic"" collections."
2,Antiquated,"Downloaded it hoping to brush up on my French, assuming these would be modern dialogues. But they seem quite ancient, using obselete forms. Completely useless for my purposes, but may be useful for certain scholars of French language."
1,Sony Camcorders fail in 2 years,"There is currently a known issue with many of the Sony Camcorders. This is being called the ""black screen of death"".What happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the CCD goes out like a light. The camera will not take video again.Sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support. The fact is Sony does not stand behind their product. If this happens to you, Sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars.There is a lengthy thread on CNET on this issue. Search for Sony black screen.Wishing you luck in the purchase of your (not Sony) video camera,Scott"
5,Captivating Photography,"Tour these venues viewing only the prime cuts of the scenery. Quality photography of completely unordinary and suprising scenery and subject matter is set to new age music, it's the kind of video that can ""take you there""."
4,"""Let's Get Uncouncous"" Good Song Great Remixes!!! Get This!","I highly recommend this album. Bedtime Stories is really good, but the remixes are out of this world. Madonna is the only one able to make awesome remixes from her songs. The remixes are actually better than the single. Survival, I dont know why it was put in there, but is pretty good too. You will dance all night to this. The video is also amazing and I think was the most expenive one made to this date. The album came out in 1994. I could not get into the RB of this album. The only song I liked was Secret and BS. I highley recommend this album to Madonna maxi single collectors!!"
2,Disappointing versions of a CLASSIC song,"""Bedtime Story"" is one of my all time favorite Madonna tracks, so I was very much looking forward to hearing the mixes. Unfortunately this maxi is standard bass thumping club fare, and very uninspired. It also includes another good track ""Survival"", but seeing as how that one's just the album version it really makes more sense to just pick up the BEDTIME STORIES disc itself, which, if you're a Madge fan, you REALLY must do."
2,Mindless Junior Vasquez remixes ruin the song.,"These remixes are a perfect example of why you should never have just one DJ remix your song. ""Bedtime Story"", one of my favorite Madonna songs of all time somehow fell almost entirely on the mixing board of Junior Vasquez. Junior's mix of jungle-drum rhythms and absurd synth chords just do not lend well to pop music. In Junior's mind, everything should be remixed in his style to play over and over again at mindless white parties and Ibiza club nights.If you want to hear the worst of Junior Vasquez look no further than these remixes which incidentally ended all future collaboration between Madonna and Junior. I still wish they would have extended the original version and left it at that."
2,"Stop repeating yourself, Madonna!","The original version of the song 'Bedtime Story' is just fine, however, all four of the remixes sound EXACTLY the same. If they actually sounded different from each other and sounded better than the original version, which they don't, more stars might have been given to this release."
2,Stick to the album version,"This is one of my favorite Madonna songs (#1 is now and ever shall be ""Like A Prayer"")...but I'm so bummed out by this single CD! The version on this is shorter than the album version (who wants THAT?), and the remixes are totally forgettable...like the bland techno at any random club. Buy the full ""Bedtime Stories"" album instead, forward to track #10 and turn it all the way up!"
3,Versatile But Fragile,"This Laser Mini Level Tool Set is pretty versatile. Besides being a level, both standard and laser, it also doubles as a phillips and slotted screw driver. It has a metric and SAE scale. The bottom is magnetized so it holds fast to metal objects for stability. It also has a clip to hold the tool securely in a pocket. Mine also came with a faux leather case to hold both the tool and the screw bits. Now the not so great. It seems very fragile. I dropped it in my grass from about 2 feet high and it just stopped operating. Also, the non-laser end which holds the screw driver bits seems to be made of plastic - not a great idea in my mind. It's a great little novelty tool. I wouldn't give it as a gift to a youngster because of the laser which is pretty bright and sets a line a fair distance."
1,Junk!,This laser is junk! The laser is off over 2 inches in just the length of a normal room and replacement batteries cost more than the original laser. Save your money and pick another product.We let Amazon know...and Amazon made things right. Thank you Amazon!
3,My 13month old loves it,"We got this as a gift from my son's music class ,he is walking and loves to pull it and the fact that it all comes apart is even better. He still puts things in his mouth which means a wash down once a week or after play dates but the paint has not come off so far"
3,train set,"am looking for the original w/whistle and light. it delights my granddaughter at 5 mos.. wanted to get another, so much cleverer than now."
4,Juxtaposition,"I haven't read this book for 40 years, so if I remember incorrectly forgive me, but what I remember most vividly is that this book is an exploration into how a group of people hold another group ""captive"" in slavery. It is a complex look into how a dominant group uses the psychology of persuasive ""inferiority"" to hold another group subjected and subserviant. By taking it out of a black/white format, one is free to see the foibles and foils of both sides."
5,Continues Hersey's fine journalistic skills. . .,"in fictional form. Written at the height of the Civil Rights movement in the United States, this book can make a white person *feel* the pain of racial discrimination. This is my personal favourite of all the Hersey output. In addition to the ""message"", this book also tells a fine story of personal courage in the face of adversity. Please do read this one."
2,Heavy-handed,"This book is so concerned about making its moral point and drawing historical parallels that all genuine emotional truth is missing. The main character isn't particularly compelling or likeable: just a typical strong and flawless victim/activist (who is a young and attractive female, of course). Nothing in this book touched me emotionally at all; it's just melodrama. I love how in the first chapter a sister to the main character is mentioned once, then completely forgotten about. This is typical; the novel's people all just seem to be placeholders being used to work out the author's intellectual exercise. After reading the other reviews here, I was expecting much better!"
1,Lovecraft is having a great time parodizing horror.,"Well, if you don't have this collection and you're a Lovecraft fan, buy it. If you're new to Lovecraft, or haven't read him, don't bother to get enthousiastic about it. It sucks! These are stories he had to write for others, or he wouldn't have bread on his table. And it tells! These stories are not Lovecraftian, but it will make you laugh if you know something about the horror pulp in the magazines back then. Or Lovecraft didn't give a damn about what would come out of his pen, or he had a jolly time mimicking ridiculous horror fiction. With an eye on the saddest story in it about a nutty proffesor who wants to conquer the world with a liquid which changes people into ash, called 'Ashes', I would go for option number 2."
4,G. L. Rockwell Unmasked!,"This autobiography is a bit slow to get into but once Rockwells life reaches maturity it is a fascinating read. This is a story of an extremely complex character who spends his life fighting odds he cannot beat (as he says in his own words!) As he matures from a young idealistic US Navy pilot in WW2 to an open Nazi in 1950's USA is quite a change, but his love for the truth and his country force him to take this path, as he believes its the only way to battle the Communist and Jewish traitors in the USA. His hardships in his later life and bitter experience of learning never to trust anyone shows how honest his heart was. A flawed man but possibly the first to talk of the necessity of world wide cooperation amongst the white peoples of all nations."
5,Important,"Rockwells greatest book. To even begin study of American N.S. and its history you MUST have read this volume. To own this is a priviledge, so exercise you right to educate beyond the liberal and socialism exercized by politicians in todays era. Look into the mind of a leader cut down before his time had come."
5,Heavy duty Drill,"This is a very specialized drill, but when you need a heavy duty drill for custom needs it preforms great."
5,Comprehensive and insightful,"This book really proves the fact that the author is the master of this field. Being a comprehensive text, it touches almost every aspect of ""photoelectron studies"". A large number of examples are taken from many recent research papers, which is the bonus of the 3rd edition. There is a well-balanced treatise of theory and applications with insightful comments."
2,The Version in GETREADY is BETTER!,"If I wrote this review before I received my GETREADY album (I imported my copy from CD-WOW in the UK for 9 pounds only :)), I would have given it 4 stars. But after listening to the GETREADY version of CRYSTAL, all I can say is PAAH !, we've been victimized by commercialization. Crystal in its final version in the GETREADY album is leagues better than any versions in this CD-Single. This CD would have been a good buy if they included the other two tracks not included in the final version of GETREADY. Instead they only add another track...!"
4,"Great ""old school"" New Order tune","This is exactly what I wanted from New Order - back to the old stuff. Not a new ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", but anyway....the pulse, the outstanding bass tunes, sing-a-long-friendly singing =), the lo-fi production! Having the mediocre Electronic and late N.O. recordings in mind, this is a step back to the mid-80s when N.O. ruled the indie scene. I've heard other songs from the new album Get Ready, and it's very promising."
2,Crystal Broken into Unsalvagable Granules,"While ""Crystal"" is one of New Order's best singles to date, the remixes included on this CD deconstruct all the great qualities of the song. Remixes should build upon an original song to maintain the original integrity, yet provide enhancements and variations in new moods. These remixes are barren, not beautiful, and lack energy."
1,"Not inspiring, just dull as dishwater.","Save your money. There are far better avenues for inspiration and hope than this insipid series of cd's. Perhaps if the message weren't delivered by the author, then it might be easier to listen to her tale of woe and redemption. As it is, Debbie Ford's voice drones on in a monotone that is close to unbearable."
5,Enlightened,"I must thank you Debbie.. I got done listening to your book today and have come to the realization of why I am stuck..An incident that happened over 25 years ago.. Something that I had let slip into the human part of me and held back my career.. I have done the hypnotherapy thing by a proffesional and was able to easily go under and tap into my sub concious effortlessly.. I already knew some of the answers to 3/4 of your questions having had ""work"" done.. Your insite is amazing.. I heard your name from an audio book from Neale Donald Walsch.. I have everyone of your books now Debbie.. I have not read them all.. but after this life changing event.. I will.Thanks so much!"
5,AWESOME!,EVERY PRAISE TEAM NEEDS TO READ AND DO A BIBLE STUDY SESSION ON THIS! SO GOOD I BOUGHT THIS TWICE!
5,Praise ye the Lord,I like this book very much. It teach me of something that I have wonder for a long time. Bob Sorge teach that we are created to praise and worship Our Creator and that we are in our right element when we do it and that the enemy must leave us when we praise our God. Psalm 8 teach also that. Very good book.
5,A great product!,"I'm petite (just under 5 feet, though I usually cheat a few extra inches through the magic of heels), so I'm used to having my feet dangling from chairs. Even with a standard footrest that sits on the floor, I have to lower the chair so low to the ground that I feel like I'm a full foot shorter than everyone else at the table. And the floor footrests are a hassle, and don't offer the mobility of moving around my workstation.This footsicle solves the problem! I wish I had one ten years ago. I mounted it on my Aeron chair, and it's been a dream. Sturdy, comfortable, and it goes wherever my chair goes. I can raise my chair so that I'm high enough over the desk, and no more dangling feet! I highly recommend this product. I think you'll be as pleased as I am."
2,Good idea that turned out bad,"Couple of things you need to know before you consider buying one of these:1. Picture quality is poor (pixely), even in true color and no matter what, screens have blueish shadow that you can't get rid of.2. Control Utility that actually sends the signal to the player from your machine (in wired or wireless setup) will eat up 70% or more of your processing power, bringing machine down to a crawl. I tested this with 4 different computers and all exhibited the same problem.3. Not all Wireless NICs will work with the player; you're better off investing in Link WNIC if you want some kind of wireless functionality.Overall, great idea that went wrong. Link support is nonexistent and I couldn't deal with slowness issue. Sent the player (and Wireless USB adapter that I bought for this) back the very same day.Stay AWAY."
1,"Slow, limited, buggy and doesn't work.","The WPG12 looked great by the specs, but I was very disappointed upon using. I returned it the same day I got it. Here are the problems:1. Limited 16MB internal storage2. Remote control is terrible. The unit takes several seconds to respond to most commands from the remote. The mouse is difficult to use.3. Stored presentation slides appear only as images. Bullets, animations, transitions and all other effects are lost.4. Switching between slides is very slow. You press the next button and it can take 10 seconds for the next slide to appear. This is a major inconvenience during a presentation.5. Controlling the presentations from wireless laptops or wired laptops did NOT work. I could only download presentations to the player. I could not get the feature that allows you to run the presentation from the laptop to work.6. The software is very buggy and crashed several times."
1,Don't waste your money and time,"I just purchased this item without first reading the reviews on this website. Let me just say that I received this item today and am returning it tomorrow. Like many others, I had no problem setting up the Presentation Player and connecting my wireless laptop. But, when I tried to actually display my screen, the device simply would not work. I talked with tech support and after insulting my intelligence by asking if I actually had a wireless network card installed, they proceeded to ask if the card I had was a Linksys brand. Of course, it wasn't and they thought my idea of returning the product wasn't a bad idea.Linksys usually has a good reputation for network and wireless products - this one is a real LOSER!"
1,not worth it,This is actually my second purchase of this product. The first time it lasted 1.5 years. This time around it lasted 4 months before one of the fans went out.
3,2 major issues,"Just picked this up and set up already. I like it, but 2 major things.1) If your pointer pad is way up in the front, then think about getting a mouse. The support for the stand gets in the way.2) If the audio ports/memory card reader are up in the front, you'll need to hack the stand.The good thing is the cooling pad can be used on its own, thereby avoiding these problems, but then you lose the stand part of the deal.3 stars for product itself for being a functional stand but more than inconvenient due to the design."
3,Could be better,"It's the sixth and final season of the show and it's finally out to complete our collection. It's the same usual bare-bones release like the others. Just the episodes, no bonuses or anything like that.The sixth season was aired in 720p. And it would have been so good if these dvds were in widescreen but they aren't. Instead, it's in full frame. If they released a blu-ray or even a widescreen version of the sixth season, I would be all over that. I would buy those in a heart beat."
4,Tintin The Complete Companion,"Before I bought this book, I've been looking this book all over my country (Indonesia). This book is a must for Tintin Fans, This book contains all about behind scene the making of tintin books. For example : How Herge doing research for The Moon Books.By the way I;am so imppresed by Amazon services, I Bought this book with the cheapest forwading service,but I received this book only 2 weeks from my purchase order...amazing..."
5,Tintin : The Complete Companion,"The book has real photos of historical events and objects (cars, planes) that the author / illustrator used to make sure that his hero's adventures were visually correct. I thought this was interesting. The book gives historic background for all of Hergé's stories. A terrific reference -- beautifully and professionally done."
5,Glucerna Shake Creamy Chocolate Delight,This shake is delicious. Only 200 calories with 5gm fiber and 10gm protein. I like to chill one for 30 min in the freezer before drinking. Only problem is that this Glucerna shake tastes too good. It's an effort to limit myself to 2 per day.
4,They work for lunch,This nutritional shake works for a quick lunch to wash down a sandwich. They were designed for the diabetic in mind so they won't win a gourmet award. I buy them because they are shelf stable and do not need refrigeration. I like to buy them from Amazon because they have a longer shelf life indicating more direct form the manufacturer.
3,Good product..not a good price,"I really like Glucerna Rich Chocolate. I have been looking for a shake with less sugar. Ensure is a good product also but the""dark chocolate"" has 18 grams of sugar. Glucerna Rich Chocolate only has 6 grams. I've been drinking it for a month or so.When I was on amazon one day I saw the 24 pack available. I assumed it would be cheaper..(yes I just hit 1 click purchase)butI didn't realize how pricey it was. At my local grocery store they are $9.09 for a ""six pack"" x 4 = $36.36 my cost on Amazon for the very same thing is $56.37 which means I paid about $14.00 a ""six Pack) $5:00 more for each.You do the math......"
2,Like drinking cardboard,"I took the recommendations of others and chilled this drink for two days before giving it a try. When I finally drank it, I almost got sick. It tastes like cold cardboard and leaves a horrible aftertaste. A few hours later, my stomach agreed with my mouth. The havoc it wreaked was unbearable.But, to be fair, I tried it again a few days later, giving it the benefit of the doubt, just in case I was coming down with some sort of stomach bug.Nope. Stomach was just fine...until I drank another one.Stay away if you cherish your insides."
4,Convenient order.,"What can I say? It arrived in a box and was very convenient to have it shipped. It is quite good and does help with blood sugar levels.Overall, it is a great tasting drink."
5,Simply excellent,I have looked and looked into every music store and before now I was unable to find this stunning Diana Ross album. I have an old tape that has worn out over time.
2,One Of Ross' Least Impressive Albums,"By far the worst album recorded during her RCA years, ""Eaton Alive"" is an almost total disaster.With the exception of a few catchy tunes like ""Love On The Line"" and ""Oh Teacher"", the very Gibb-influenced album is just downright boring. The true gem on this CD is ""Chain Reaction"", a song reminicient of her Supremes days. The title track is not bad either. However, the lyrics to the song are so muffled that it's impossible to figure out exactly what she's singing.""Eaton Alive"" started a downward spirial in Ross' career. While she managed to score a #1 record with ""Chain Reaction"" in Europe, the singles from the album flopped on the Pop charts in the states while the title track only saw moderate success on the U.S. R&B listings. The album went no where on either chart.Despite returning to Motown and recording a couple of fine albums after this muddled mess, Ross has failed to redeem herself on the charts, lacking a significant hit since 1984."
3,Even after 14 years......,"Diana Ross' RCA output in the 1980s was mostly dismal, rarely showcasing anything else but ""image"". Oddly enough, this album from 1985 actually sounds better and more ""relevent"" than it did 14 years ago. Diana had some exceptional songwriting and producing talent here and because of it, Ross comes off surprisingly well. Though forever stamped with the electronic 80s sound, this album stands as one of her stronger in the 80s and since."
5,"What Other People, Other Towns Have Done","I'm sure that you are busy. I've got a lot of things to do myself, more than I can get done today. And then the time comes when you have to stop being busy, some times you just have to sit and let the batteries recharge. As the old saying goes, sometimes I sits and thinks, and sometimes I just sits.And the question has to come up of what can one person, you or me do to make the community we live in a better place. Suzanne Morse's book can't tell you what you can do. But it can tell you what other people like you have done. Will her ideas work in New York City, no. Will they work on the block you live in within New York City, in the neighborhood you live in, yes.Meanwhile I've got to quit writing about this book. I'm going help the local community theater try to get started. I don't know anything about theater, but I can find some way to help, even if it's just sweeping the floor."
5,BIBLE OF HEALING,"That book is amazing.There is alot of diferent energitic healing methods and a vast of books for the subject,but this the best I've ever read.A small book but contains everything for being a healer,simplest and most efficient methods I've ever seen.No need to take long courses;just read and practice this book."
3,Urban Peasant Warfare,"Urban Peasant Warfare""Urban Guerrilla Warfare"" by Robert Moss is a dated and re-hashed work. However, this work provides an analysis of the final phase of direct American involvement in the Vietnam War. Additionally this book provides an appendix with unabridged copy of ""Mini-manual of the Urban Guerrilla"" by Carlos Marighella. Overall not a bad book."
4,It's okay,"It's a change from We Rock Hard and Pressure Point. I'm not sure what to think of it yet, but I was hoping it'd have more of the classic sounds that made me turn to the Freestylers. I would definitely recommend We Rock Hard and Pressure Point, but am still not sure what to think of this album. It's a bit more repetive and dance-like than previous albums. I wish some of the songs had (more) words."
1,A Cheater's Book,"I bought this book as a gift for my brother, expecting him to learn a few showy tricks to impress me with. However, he told me later that basically the whole book was about cheating. He wasn't really interested by that, and the book is still sitting on a shelf at my house. I wish I'd been better informed about what kind of tricks were in the book."
5,Nice little film about harness race horses,"This movie was originally made for the European audiance. Disney Studios made a number of quieter movies specifically for the foreign market tastes, and they usually ran it on the television show later. This aired in Europe in 1977, and was broadcast on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" as a two part show beginning on March 25, 1979. Directed by Don Chaffey, it is the story of a young boy in Australia who loves the sport of horse harness racing, which he shares with his grandfather. Grandpa runs a farm, but is losing money on it when he finds a young horse that could be a big winner. They train the horse together and learn some lessons along the way. Great movie."
4,Born to Run,At times the sound quality of this video was fair but that is to be expected for an older video tape. The story itself is not always interesting and at times (because of the age of the video) the speech segments were not always as clear.
4,Wanna mess with people's heads :D,"Play this track in a club, especially if they like reggae/pop...it takes the sample of Lumidee's (uh oh's) from I'll Never Leave You and the melodic hook from the chorus (without the words), with some killer German-Dance production from Jan Wayne kicking out at 140 BPM!!!!"
1,This is part of a boxed set.,"This is not a freestanding album nor should it be sold as such - it is CD no. 1 in a boxed set. (I own the set.) See the purple ""1"" on the cover."
1,"Bought 8 of them, all were already dried up when opened.","I ordered 8 of these Lining Pens as I had purchased one while in Europe and loved it. I was very disappointed in the product I recieved as all of them are good for about one use, and then are too dried up to get any product out after that. I thought maybe it was only one or two of them that were bad, but they were all the same. Considering how much I spent on them, this was a very bad investment."
4,"Holiday Classic with Kermit , Miss Piggy, and Michael Caine","The score from The Muppet Christmas Carol is full of the spirit of Christmas. The familiar story by Dicken's is given new life with the great score (mostly written by Paul Williams). Great energy is relayed to the listener as Scrooge (Michael Caine)is painted in words and as Bob Cratchet (Kermit the Frog) sings with his co-workers 'One More Sleep 'Til Christmas'. The love song duet between Scrooge (Michael Caine) and his fiancee during a ghostly vision brings great pathos to the character. For lovers of the Muppets and or Dickens, there is no better way to enter into the spirit of the season."
5,Songs that should be seasonal favorites,"This movie, and the songs in it, capture some of the best of the Christmas spirit. as does the Dickens original story. Many of these songs, such as ""One More Sleep"", and ""Thankful Heart"", should be much bigger holiday favorites than they are."
4,Great addition to my Muppet collection,"Great CD with all your favorite songs from the movie, and some that didn't quite make the movie's cut. Great addition to the many Muppet Christmas CDs. Highly recommended."
5,I Watch it Every Christmas Season!,"I watch this every December as it is truly a favorite, classic, feel-good movie. Michael Caine does a magnificent job playing Ebeneezer Scrooge and the entire cast of the Muppets retell the story of Charles Dicken's classic, ""A Christmas Carol,"" as he encounters three ghosts on Christmas Eve. You find yourself singing along with the wonderful songs that provide hope, faith and evaluation of ones actions that aid Ebeneezer in changing his ways. A must see for every Christmas season whether you're young or old!"
5,Great music,"This is the soundtrack to the movie. I am a huge fan of the movie and when I found this I was super excited. So if you love the movie, you'll love this."
5,Love this album!,"So glad they finally made a mp3 version of this album! My CD was becoming worn. If you loved this movie, I would suggest this album."
5,LOVE IT!,"I just LOVE this movie. I seen it back when it came out in 1992 and...we watch it EVERY Christmas Eve! I always think about getting the CD, but by the time I think about it I can't find it! This year I didn't wait, and I am so glad I didn't! What a fun addition to my Christmas music collection!"
3,It's alright,I honestly feel that the songs sound different in the movie versus this CD. I love all the songs but I wanted to have them exactly the way they were in the movie so it's good for me but not great.
2,Muppet Christmas Carol CD,I can't really do much reviewing of the item because I never recieved it. I tried to contact the seller and he never replied back as to why my order go cancelled. The item was suppose to be a Christmas gift but I didn't know it was cancelled until after it was to late to buy another one from someone else.
4,Vivid tale of two worlds.,"When artic explorer Noel Magnus, searching for the missing Franklin expedition, kept putting off marriage to Rachel Howland, the only white woman in the frozen north, she took the cursed black opal he wanted and fled to Noel's home in New York, posing as his widow. Along the way, she acquires two homeless children who are also seen as Noel's children. When Noel arrives in New York, he vows to make Rachel's life hell. In addition, Rachel is being threatened by Noel's sworn enemy and competitor, Edmund Hoar.A vast improvement over McKinney's last novel, this is a rich tale filled with conflict and tension. THE MERRY WIDOW kept me reading until the last page, long after my bedtime."
1,Disturbing,"I have read hundreds and hundreds of historical romances, and I like a strong and sometimes moody hero as well as the next person, but the hero of this book is simply abusive. I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book and I have yet to see any tenderness. He behaves as though he hates her. This is romance? I don't think so."
1,Very disappointing,"I am a big fan of Meagen McKinney's but found this book to be very disappointing. At first, I enoyed the heroine as she stuck with her beliefs and morals. I found the ""hero"", however to be excessively violent and akin to a spoiled four year old child. His frequent outbursts bored me and I admit that I have yet to find the energy to finish the book."
1,Amateur writing from an old pro,"Who is writing this under McKinney's pseudonym? I can forgive some things from an old pro - boring characters, implausible plot, and inconsistent story-line. Maybe she just had a bad spell. But I cannot forgive such awful grammar - it's an insult to the reader, by both writer and editor. Please, next time concentrate on the meaning of lie vs. lay and farther vs. further; stop splitting infinitives and study up on subjunctive mood; and the case of pronouns!! Goodness, you use phrases such as ""between Betsy and I"" and ""It was her...."" I am appalled."
1,"Oy, what a dud.","I adore Meagan McKinney books but this one is painful to read. I finally had to stop around forty pages from the end because I dreaded picking up the book. Although the first chapter or two have some charm, none of it makes any sense and it just gets darker and darker and increasingly less plausible. I agree with the previous critic who suggested this book was ghost-written."
5,Finally a domestic release for this gem,"I picked up all of Clinic's releases on a trip to the UK in 2000, after hearing them on the John Peel show. Their first full album, ""Internal Wrangler"", is one of the freshest rock releases of the last couple of years. While their influences aren't anything out of the ordinary (you will hear bits of the Velvets, 13th Floor Elevators and Suicide among others), what they do with them certainly is. This is a very dense, beautiful and hypnotic record. Clinic has a fine ear for sound and melody, and makes every second of this record count. I'm sure many listeners will not make it past the off kilter vocal style, which at times has a Peter Lorre quality to it, and that's really a shame, because groups like this don't show up very often. Listen to this one on headphones if you really want to lose yourself."
4,Classic Snake.,"True to the spirit of the Deep Purple mk.3 and 4 albums,'Ready and Willing'offers solid,blues-based hard rock that, even at the time it was initially released ,was regarded as antiquated by many.In spite of that,true to themselves,Coverdale and company recorded a timeless album."
3,PIECES OF METAL,"This is my first John Shirley book and I agree with other reviewers who feel it's comparable to some of King's and Koontz's earlier works. I admit that the book held my interest and I was impressed with Shirley's narrative flow. Seems there might have been too many characters to focus on, so there tended to be some redundant and superfluous scenes. Shirley etches his characters fairly well, and there are no ""safe"" characters in this one (which is also reminiscent of John Saul and King).CRAWLERS is basically a ""Body Snatchers"" with a cruel metallic twist. These nanotechnological horrors are using human bodies to regenerate into killing machines and threaten to take over the world. The imagery Shirley conveys in these transmutations is spellbinding, and would work very well cinematically. There are some tightly suspenseful scenes, and some good dialogue between the teens and their adult counterparts.A good novel, nothing highly original, but worth a read."
3,Crawlers is ok.,"Mr. Shirley does know how to tell a story and he manages to maintain suspense through out, but I found his characters to be somewhat cookie cutter (and too many of them, I couldn't keep easy track) although he certainly has a good ear for dialogue.Crawlers has an interesting enough plot, but it is executed over too many pages. It starts with a boom and we barely hear an echo for a hundred pages after. Four hundred pages later, I found myself wondering when it was going to end.I will read Mr. Shirley's other works but for the moment, I find myself not trusting his work completely."
2,Shirley's worst,"Crawlers is little more than Shirley recycling bad Dean Koontz novels from the late 80s. Compared to Demons, The Song Called Youth cycle and the rest of Shirley's terrific work, Crawlers is at best disappointing. Anything else from Shirley's work is better than this."
5,No More Throwing Up !!,"Our cat loves this food and after years of tummy problems, we've finally narrowed it down to corn or wheat allergy. This ""pure and simple"" cat food is wonderful! Thank you so much for a great product!"
3,Good cd but not good enough for older fans,"Warning isn't bad enough, but it lacks heavier riffs. That is the only problem. After you listened the album carefully, the rhythm, the lyrics, the instruments, they are alright. This album is definitely similar as nimrod, but as i mentioned before the only negative point is the heaviness of the riffs, and one more problem is the song misery, that is a very different style to Green Day, it is not bad but i hope bigger songs from them and i hope them to make Dookie 2 or at least Insomniac 2...Rock on guys..."
4,Green Day changes yet again!,"Before the trio wore eye liner and after their hardcore punk found them fame they put out this great album: Warning. This CD has a ton of variety, including an accordian performance, solid punk, a few acoustic jams and more!Their punk roots are apparent in ""Blood, Sex And Booze"" and ""Jackass"", instead of being short 2 minute punk jams like before in Dookie and Nimrod, they sound a little more like rock songs, which personally, I like better."
1,Dont listen to the five star reviewers...this album is horrible,"Green Day is one of the worst bands of recent times and are as bad as similar groups like N'SYNC,BACKSTREET BOYS and WESTLIFE.THEY ARE A TEEN POP BAND AND SUCK!!!!!!!!.Warning is as bad as American Idiot,so take my advice and stay away from this awful album as well as all the other albums from GREEN DAY.Get albums from great bands like THE WHO,LED ZEPPELIN,BLACK SABBATH,DEEP PURPLE,PINK FLOYD,RUSH,ROLLING STONES,AC/DC and THE BEATLES instead."
2,Vanilla,"Plain, uninspired, boring, slow, SOLD OUT. That's to sum up what I think aobut this album. Green Day was my favorite band...they eased me into punk and although tehy didn't always play fastest, they seemed to be the most unique, and to me, prone to be the most origninal. This album, however, sucks. The songs are really far away from Green Day's punk roots, the lyrics seem trite and really meaningless. This album is not Green Day. I saw them play soem of these songs live, and they actually played them like the punks they started as, but they slowed them down on this album to go mainstream. Boo Green Day, and lets hope that they learn to get back to their roots soon."
1,Warning: This album does NOT rock!,"The rip-it-up Green Day of old is long gone, my friends. They've obviously found out that sappy syrupy ballads that appeal to high school drama queens sell =way= more records than the ripping rock-out songs that Green Day =used= to be good at. Get out the wheel chairs... looks like Green Day is padding their bank accounts before their retirement. This record is weak. It lacks spunk and muscle. If you long for the Green Day that =rocked=, buy Rancid 2000 instead. This Green Day album has more in common with Backstreet Boys than with anything 'alternative'. The boys have gone soft... and they're getting softer. Weak, weak, and did I mention? weak?"
1,THIS ALBUM [STINKS]!,"Don't believe the hype. The boys sound tired, and the album is a retread and attempt at former glory (the only difference is that they use acoustic guitars this time). Save your [money]."
1,Not very good at all,"Slow, boring songs and the good ones get old fast. Green Day is going down the tubes."
5,Great CD.,"In my opinion, the best Greenday CD yet. They sound very similar to both Nirvana and They Might Be Giants, oddly. Still, a great CD."
4,is this green day or the beatles? i'm not exactly sure,"this is the first cd that i've gone out and gotten on the first day it was out. that's how much i've been anticipating green day's latest. if it wasn't for billie joe's vocals, i almost couldn't tell that this was the same green day that created kerplunk, 1039...hours, dookie, and insomnia. they've picked up where nimrod left off, pushing the punk envelope. if it wasn't for the fact that it was green day, they would have only gotten 3. i'm not sure if this cd will stay in my player as long as some of their other cd's have, but it's pretty good. if you like old green day, blood, sex, and booze, is in that vein, and if you like good riddance, minority and macy's day parade fit that. with the rest falling somewhere in the middle. a good cd as far as i can tell so far."
1,"DONT LISTEN TO METALLICA ROCKS REALLY HARD A.K.A WHIRLIGIG,GREEN DAY ARE REALLY BAD","I WANT TO REMIND THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER THAT HE NEEDS TO STOP SLAMMING GREAT BANDS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,THE BEATLES,BLACK SABBATH AND AC/DC EVERYDAY UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES OR ELSE OTHER PEOPLE WILL SLAM THE AWFUL BANDS THAT HE LIKES.THIS WHIRLIGIG KID IS GETTING ON MY NERVES.WILL SOMEONE GET THIS IDIOTIC WHIRLIGIG KID OFF THIS WEBSITE.ANYWAY WARNING IS QUITE BAD AND GREEN DAY ARE BAD TOO.AVOID BOTH."
2,"Okay, but not great","this c.d. is okay but not great, sure Green Day is a good band, but their last true good album was kerplunk, everything after that was totally ripped off and to keep lowering the stars, punk has gone out of style, to the people who bought this, you're wasting money, what get's danced to more, punk or pop, hmmm that's a hard one, that's why i think Warning is a poor excuse for an album, let alone a poor excuse for Green Day"
1,one hit wonder,"get the single for ""Warning,"" then wait for the next album. It might be another ""Nimrod""."
1,Green Day Warnig CD,"Listed as like new condition, this was false, CD had several scratches on it and the graphics were faded from being in the sun, like it had been stored in one of those automobile visor cd files"
5,Green Day,All of Green Day's albums are just awesome. I really loved this one and I think everyone should buy this CD. I can not stop listening to track 6 though. Misery is their best song ever because it holds an excellent tune plus has a good story line. Other then that I think all the songs are great as well and thats why I give it 5 stars.
5,Great Stuff,I have been waiting forever for this album...and the wait was worth it....BJ and his music seems to have grown up a bit...but it is as awesome as before...softer a bit maybe
5,This is a great CD.,"This is a great CD. It breaks apart from some of what Green Day was in the last album and has a fresh new sound. The songs sound great and are somewhat catchy. If you liked Green Day before you should get this CD, but then of course, everyone should get this CD. Simply put, great."
5,The reviewer below me is a moron!,"To The Infidel.Your opinion of the band is not needed. Green Day are one of the greatest rock groups of all time. They have lots of talent, they are just as great as Dire Straits, & the great Guns n Roses. This album has great songs like Warning, Minority, Waiting, & Macy's Day Parade. Please ignore the moron below and get this with American Idiot. They rock."
4,Wow?,"What a change. You know the first time I heard manority on the radio, I thought the DJ was drunk and said it was made by Green Day. I was wrong. Green day seems to have taken on a ""quieter"" and ""calmer"" tone, but a nice one and kept the same type of touch that greenday has always had with a good touch. Get this cd!"
5,Outstanding,"The long awaited Green Day album is finally here, and it's amazing! Each track could be released as a single in its own right thanks to the careful lyrics and guitar riffs you'll be humming all day. Buy it now - you won't be disappointed!"
4,"Good, but not Great","A common trend in punk bands nowadays is that eventually, they all (or at least most of them) grow up at some time or another. Grow up, meaning that their sound is a little bit mellower, not as fast and hard as it was before, and the lyrics don't have that immature riff anymore. I'm not saying that ""grown-up"" band's music is bad, it just isn't what it was before. It is evident that this what has happened to Green Day. Their sound is really different, it's more poppy punk, rather than punk. You would be hard pressed to say that there weren't any good songs on this album though, because songs like Minority, and Blood, Sex, and Booze are really great. All of the songs on the album are really good though, but they just don't sound like the old Green Day that many of us know so well. You could say that ""Warning"" is Matchbox Twenty's greatest album ever. But to sum it all up, Green Day has grown up."
4,decent disc,"this album is a new direction for green day. instead of billie joe singing about masturbation, apathy, and wasting time, the band has expanded their horizons with well written lyrics, and creative music and beats, as comapred with the old three-chord, simple beat style. ive always liked green day's music, and the 2 different styles can't be compared... all im saying is, it's a change, and change is good"
3,"Okay, but not Green Day","Lady's and gentlemen, with the lures of money, it is hard not to sell out. With that said, Green Day, like many a great band, has sold out. I think I heard two electric gitaurs on the whole album. The only worthwhile songs, debateably even, is Minority. What happened to the witty, funny lyrics? And Tre Cool's drumming talent seems to have deteriorated since Insomniac, I don't know how. I just want to scream ""No! No! This ... is not Green Day!"" However, if it were under a different band name, I would not object to it, besides not much lyrical depth. Accordians, harmonicas and church organs are not what Green Day should be, but the music, if not under the band name, would get 4 stars."
2,[carbon copy],"The best song on this album (""Misery"") is almost a carbon copy of Tom Waits' ""Rain Dogs"" from the album of the same name. The music, the ""Well, well"" part, everything, is taken from the earlier song.And these Berkeley boys aren't punk. As far as I'm concerned, punk lasted for a few years back in the late 70s. Green Day has made some decent ""Alternative Rock"" in the past, but you won't find that here. Buy Wire's 1977 album ""Pink Flag"" for good authentic punk."
2,BAD.....,"Warning is the album that really ends my interest in Green day...They had some good songs like BASKET CASE, THE GROUCH, WALKING CONTRADCTION and others but i never really was a big fan of the punk pop of green day...Warning is way more pop than previous albuns...There's 2 or 3 decent POP songs but most are a mix of EMO with uninspired songs...They really really lost their way after this...."
5,Green Day goes POP!,"You've heard some of this on the radio. It's good Green Day stuff. If you like the voice, you'll like this stuff."
5,"Great album, great band.","Green Day has always been evolving. Since way back with their first full album 1039/Slappy, each progressive album has grown and differed from what came before it. Warning is no exception, as the band expands their horizons, creating different songs with different instruments. Building from the experimental momentum of Nimrod tracks like ""Last Ride In,"" ""King for a Day,"" and ""Good Riddance,"" Green Day tries some new material and better song crafting. Don't be fooled though, it's still signature Green Day, with tons of hooks, energy, and clever, hilarious lyrics (Blood, Sex, and Booze, Jackass). And who cares if it's poppier than their previous releases? Green Day has always had a certain pop sense, but their punk roots always shine through. While Dookie was catchy and fun, and American Idiot is a rock masterpiece, this album is just good music. You won't regret it.P.S. Green Day's the best live band I have ever seen. Watch them in their stadium tour!"
5,Warning: This album might be infectious,"2000's Warning was Green Day's least selling album since their best selling album Dookie. However, that doesn't mean that Warning is a bad album. It features some very catchy songs with infectious music. Minority, Waiting, and the title track, Warning, are the three tracks that were released as singles. The album's remaining tracks are a combination of signature Green Day: Fashion Victim, Deadbeat Holiday; with some promising new-ground venturing tunes: Blood Sex And Booze, the Beatles-esque Misery, Church On Sunday, the Dylan-esque Hold On, and the beautiful Macy's Day Parade, that all sum up the highlights on Warning.This album sounded cool when it was first released, and now with the release of Green Day's masterpiece American Idiot, it sounds even better.RecommendedA-"
4,not as popular but still good,"I happened to really like this album. I have been a fan of Green Day for years and though everyone still goes to Dookie for the poster child of good Green Day music, I see a lot of good in their other works. Warning has great songs with styles that do branch out from the ordinary. Everyone is so quick to talk about American Idiot and how it's so different but really you could see the tides beginning to change with this album. They were already becoming more mature at this point. If you don't believe me, take a good listen to the song ""Misery"". Its rather spooky. It doesn't use the traditional guitar, bass, and drums, it introduces a sound that we usually don't hear from them, though it vaguely reminds me of ""Hitchin A Ride"". Misery has a rather creepy vibe. Mix in the creepy with the slightly political and the classic pop-punk sound and you have the album. To me its not their best work but its still up there with the great Green Day albums."
3,eh........,"well its sad to say but Green Day has gone pretty much to the Pop side of music...... yes Minority is a great song and probably the best on the album but its pretty much the only song alike, on the album. Castaway which i think should of made its round on the ""Castaway"" movie soundtrack, isnt far behind, and Warning is a good one too.... but the rest is just blah. could be better and a lot Punkier.!"
4,Very good cd,"Green Day has grown up. This album isn't as hard as their previous ones. This one has alot more accoustic on it. This is a very different sound. It's not your average punk. Very good album. Best songs are Warning, Church on Sunday, Castaway, Minority, and Macys Parade. This is a very good cd and definatly worth buying."
4,"Great cd, but what happened to the guitar?","I've been a Green Day fan for a long time and own all their stuff (I think). This is a departure from previous material in a significant way. Yes, the tunes are more introspective, mature, blah blah blah. But more importantly is the differece in the guitar. Don't expect the manic sharp power chords of previous material. The guitar is now closer to a Days of the New-like sound. Also, the bass line is much thicker than in the past. Adsent is the rapid fire punk fury. Cool but different."
2,WARNING! Do Not Buy This CD!!!,"The early 90's punk rock band, Greenday, has previously put out four great punk albums: 1,039 Smothed Out Slappy Hours (1990), Kerplunk (1991), Dookie (1994), Insomniac (1994), and Nimrod (1997). The realse of there new album, Warning, was long awaited by millions of Geenday fans worldwide. However, the joy of a new Greenday was soon dampered when it occured to the old school Greenday fans that this album is the worst yet.The reason that I gave this album 2 stars is: 1. Its greenday and 2. I like the song Misery. This didn't even deserve 1 star. If you liked any other Greenday album, don't buy this album."
1,Most boring band in history,Only little immature kids like overrated bands like Green Day.They are one of the worst bands in history.Their vocalist Billie Joe who uses make up like a girl just cant sing in tune and their guitar is just two string power chords without any solos.Each and every song on this are a turd.AVOID all albums from this massively overrated band.Get PHYSICAL GRAFFITI from LED ZEPPELIN instead.
1,What the hell is this!?,OK Anybody remember the days when Green Day was a punk band? Well now they do country dance music.
2,And now for something completely similar..,"Warning isn't necesarrily a bad CD. It just isn't all that great. It lacks Green Day's usual energy and humor; the songs seem to get diluted and repetitive. Minority, one of the CD's better moments, is a catchy anthemic song about nonconformity and shunning authority, as is the title track, Warning, with lyrics that were supposedly taken off bumper stickers. I found the song Waiting to get pretty annoying, Billie Joe's voice seems almost nasal on this track and is it just me or does it sound a hell of a lot like a song called Downtown or something? I heard a radio DJ mention that too.If you're looking for a good Green Day CD, you'd be better off with one of their earlier efforts such as Dookie or Nimrod, from before they seemed to lose their edge. If you like Green Day, also check out Bad Relgion, a great punk band, The Living End, Suicide Machines, etc.Growing up, selling out, call it what you want but Green Day just isn't the same with Warning."
2,not like the previous green day CDs,"I bought this CD on the assumption that a lot of the songs would be like Minority, which is a great song. I was surprised to learn that this CD is softer than its predecessors like dookie and insomniac (which I strongly recommend). There are only a few songs on this CD that I found particularly good: Minority, Castaway, and Deadbeat Holiday. Misery is also a good song, and it shows a different style from the others. The rest of the CD is simply mediocre. The new sound of Green Day just doesn't work as well as the heavier instrumentation in earlier songs."
2,I could see this coming,"Green Day used to be my favorite band, but when Nimrod came out, I could see them starting to go down hill. Green Day is running out of orginality. All of their new stuff on Warning sounds like softer versions of their old stuff, and they have ripped the beetles off many times in this cd. I know that they are not changing their sound just to be popular,(like blink 182), but they could've done a lot better on this album. There isn't one punk song on it, and everything sounds the same. This is definatly Green Days worst work. I wouldn't waste your money on it. Instead buy some NOFX. They are one band that will never sellout."
4,Nice change of pace,"The reviews on this album crack me up. I try not to get hung up on what a band has done in the past. Seems a lot of these people want this band to keep playing the same kind of music or they consider it a betrayal. Same crap you see on any modern Metallica album. Wouldn't you get bored to tears playing the same music for over a decade? These guys aren't freakin' teenagers anymore.Anyhow, I liked this cd. I've got Dookie and rest. Yes this is a little lighter although the lyrics are about the same level. They opted for a little more acoustic sound. I like it a lot. To be honest I'm not sure I would have bought another Green Day cd if the single ""Minority"" wouldn't have sounded different than previous Green Day cds. They gave a little hint that they were getting bored with normal punk rock on Nimrod. (I actually liked Dookie better than Nimrod)Really liked the title track and the majority of the songs are good. There's so few good rock cd's coming out."
4,Normall,This Album is still very good its just like it sounds the same and well they always do but they ROCK and this does have some bad words in there not to many though so for kids like around the age 10 or older u should check into buying this green day is the type of band that like either u like it or you dont so listen to the preview first but awesome cd check it out
2,I was disappointed,"Warning was not what I expected but it is not a bad album. I will expect better next time around but maybe I am bias because I like their old stuff. Anyways, some bands really leap forward when they reinvent there sound but Greenday does not. Radiohead has done an excellent job changing from album to album (see Kid A) please Greenday stick to what you do best and do not make any more songs like ""Misery"", I felt like I was in Misery listening to this....hopefully this will be the last album like this they ever make. buy this used if best and do not pay full price like me... they made a fast buck on this disappointing album..... what's sad is it took three years to make it..."
3,"Good new sound, but isn't as good as old stuff.","Green day's getting older, and I guess they don't feel like playing punk. This new album isn't punk at all. If your looking for dookie type stuff, don't buy warning. It's not a bad record, though. It's a new sound that could be built on."
4,A New Leaf,"After years of silence Green Day has returned to the music scene. All of you who saw them this summer on the Warped Tour know these guys haven't lost a step. On the new album, Warning, Green Day continues to follow some of the steps first taken on Good Riddence. They add more acoustic sounds and give the album a more pop-punk feel than ever before. With songs like Church on Sunday, Billy Joe has shown a new writing style, one with more meaning and substance. Overall fans of Dookie or Kerplunk may not be thrilled, but this is a great album that will bring many new fans to the wonderful world of Green Day."
4,Jeckyl vs. Hyde,"It's good, really good. The only problem is it's such a different style, it's a very likeable style,but the side of me that wants angry ranting is not very happy with this album."
4,good,I'm a fan of green day and i liked the songs but it doesn't really flow together.1 Warning 4/52 Blood Sex and Booze 5/53 Church on Sunday 3/54 Fashion Victim 4/55 Castaway 4/56 Misery 5/57 Deadbeat Holiday 5/5 (Its about birthdays)8 Hold on 4/59 Jackass 5/510 Waiting 4/5 (Waitng for something for a long time and finally getting it)11 Minority 5/512 Macys Day Parade 5/5
4,Mature Punk,"Green Day is showing it's staying power as the best punk band of all time. A good mixture of switching tempos and messages, Green Day has come a long way. Minority, Warning, and Waiting are the best songs and shows what punk is all about"
5,Not for the pit,"When I think of Green Day I used to think of punks on a major label, now i think matured...In other words, this album is pretty amazing, excellent songwriting, etc. But its not punk in the slightest, this is about as punk as blink 182. Bj took time to mature and basically ignored the regular fanbase but theres acupple songs for the dookie-boys, like blood sex n booze is good. To sum this up, not for the pit anymore, slow with acoustic guitars, this is more like the wallflowers, who arent that bad"
4,Starting to change my mind,"When i first got this cd, i gave it an offensive reveiw, but as i try to listen to it more and more, i start liking it a little better each time. I mean, I don't have anything against Green Day. I respect Billie Joes decision about getting getting tired of playing punk, and at least they didn't go out of punk like the sad way blink did. Green day will always be a classic band of this erra, and will still be popular 20 years from now. They are awsome live too. Overall, this cd is ok, but im sure as i get older, i will start to like it more. Dookie will always be my favorite cd though."
3,A CD with 41 minutes of music on it,"What's here is okay, thus far I haven't really seen the energy included in their previous efforts. But C'MON GUYS! CDS HOLD OVER 70 MINUTES OF MUSIC! Warning clocks in at almost 42 minutes of music...enough to fit on a vinyl album (hey, they did that too, wonder if that's why...). Music is good, but not nearly enough of it on a CD for my money."
4,They've seen better days,"Green Day just is not as punk as they used to be. Perhaps they are finally growing up. Anyway, ""Warning"" just doesn't reach they days of ""Dookie"". Some noteworthy tracks are ""Minority"" the single off the cd so far. ""Misery"" which has some decent elements and creativity to it. Also the sweat balladry of ""Waiting"" is cute but deffinatly not punk. If you are looking for punk it no longer exists in Green Day. However, they haven't gone all electronic or nu-rap metal which is very parise worthy."
3,a normal pop song,if u like 'Dookie' then don't buy this cd. This is a pop song. and it is not great. just a few song is ok.
4,Warning- Green Day,"I got into Green Day pretty late on through my brother (after listening to stuff like Blink-182, etc). But I liked them so much I went out and bought six albums, (seeing as how this doesn't quite compete to Nimrod- I'm not sure anything could- I've only given it four stars). So I was delighted when I heard they were releasing a new album, and was CERTAINLY not disappointed when I bought it on the day it came out! It has so much variety, from the 'Time of Your Life'-esque 'Macy's Day Parade' to the, erm, Levellers- esque single 'Minority' and the punk-pop 'Church on Sunday', it's clear Green Day still haven't lost it. The best track is probably 'Blood, Sex and Booze', or 'Misery', both of which are really different and unusual (and have great lyrics as always). They may have changed their style over the years but they still sound great!"
4,'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout a brand new hope.....,"Green Day is a good band but they just like Metallica, eventually slowed things down. Nevertheless this is a good album with some highlights like Blood, Sex and Booze and the incredible beautiful and fantastic Macy's Day Parade. This song is really great, and definetly their best ballad.NI!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"Once again one can see how easy it is for a band to sell out for riches and fame. This record is a virtual about-face from the brash, obnoxious, loud Green Day that I'm used to. Not sure what their intent was when the released this record, but it clearly is pop music, not punk. They're almost contradicting the very reason for which they chose to be a punk band; to demur and ridicule popular culture. Anyway, I guess they were trying to explore some new musical territory... and the songs aren't that bad; A few are actually quite good (hence the 3 stars). But, the very least they could have done was release the album under a different name, so the bona-fide, long-time Green Day fans (if there are any left) won't get confused who is who. Admittedly, I will always admire Green Day simply because of Slappy, 1,000 Hours; the early stuff (and some select other tunes not know amongst the general public). I just hope they'll go back to their roots some time soon..."
3,Okay...,"You might like this, you might not. Personally, I gave it away to my friend, but you may be different.It depends on your tastes, really.If you were head over heels in love with the old Greenday like I was (my good ol' hometown boys!), you might not like this as much. It's definitely more pop and less punk. This isn't to say that it isn't punk: it's just more of a punk/pop mix with more standard melodies and more designed for radio play. An attempt at a fan pleaser that does not succeed with everyone, and didn't succeed with me.This isn't to say it was a bad CD. It just isn't the same Greenday that I loved. They're actually sounding kind of like Nickleback or Sum41 (EEK! - sorry, couldn't resist.)""Warning"" is an okay song. I don't get all the hype about ""Minority"" - it just sounds like a jingle to me.Buy it if you like, but get Dookie and Insomniac and Nimrod first."
5,Great CD But Not Green Day's Best,"I have to admit when i first heard this cd i was disapointed. It wasn't what i expected after getting dookie and the others (1039 Smoothed out slappy hours, kerplunk, insomniac, and nimrod. I expected it to be a lot like the other ones which had a drive into kinda sound, but this one is a little slower and dosen't have the same grinding guitar sound. At first i wasn't sure if i liked it but now i think it is great. The cd is a little slow but it still has great green day lyrics and a catchy sound. Some of my favorite songs are ""Castaway"" ""Warning"" ""Church on Sunday"" and a couple more like ""Macy's Day Parade."" Even though i think this cd is great i still have to say that dookie is their best cd. Green Day has matured over the years and their music is changing but they are still my favorite band and always will be."
3,Not bad at all,This album is a respectable offering from Green Day. It is hard to really be excited about Warning though because of the levels of greatness they reached with Kerplunk and 1039 Hours. I guess you cant stay young and hungry forever.
3,"OK, but not PUNK","This is an OK CD, but it's certainly not punk. I personoly liked it better when Green Day was a fast paced band whose songs where worth listening to. If you like the beatles with clashing lyrics then I guess this CD would be the way to go. Otherwise, check put Pinhead Gunpowder, another punk rock band with Billy Joe Armstrong. I'm sure they'll never sell out."
5,Cannot Go Wrong With This One!,"Green Day continues evolving and experimenting, yet maintains the formula that has made them so legendary. Thier social commentary continues to be penetrating, and the music is absorbing. You absolutely cannot go wrong buying this CD. It IS 'different' from any of their other titles. Don't expect anything as fast and pounding as some of their earlier, angrier songs. But expect to be pleased with this group's evolution. EVERY song is excellent. You won't be able to get the melodies out of your head."
5,Surprisingly Good,"I enjoyed the singles ""Minority"" and ""Warning"" and decided to give the album a shot. I was blown away at how listenable it was from beginning to end. There are, in my opinion, no bad tracks that deserve the fast forward button. Billy Joe Armstrong's songwriting has clearly improved in this effort. Particularly enjoyable are ""Castaway"" and ""Church on Sunday."" Hail the kings of power chords-- this one is well worth your money."
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD. In my opinion, it is a lot better than Nimrod. The songs are much different from their earlier albums such as Kerplunk, Dookie, and Insomniac. All of the songs are good songs, so you dont need to skip around the cd looking for good stuff. The only bad thing that I can think of on this cd is that its a little short. It has only 13 songs, I think. Great CD to listen to anytime."
3,For the diehard fan,"Its pretty good but not Green Day. Lets say you've never heard Green Day and you buy Warning. You will say, ""I like this, why don't I buy some earlier stuff"" Then, once you listen to Dookie or Nimrod or Insomniac, you will be blown away at how much better it is then Warning. Basically, Warning is much slower than any other Green Day. The songs aren't that bad but extremely repetitive. Add that to their slowish tempo, and they all seem to drag on for years... The verses seeming to go on forever and the choruses drilling into your skull.The only exception is Minority, the only song that really sounds like old Green Day. Its upbeat, loud, fast, short but not too short. Warning is worth 3 stars, but I expect a lot more than that from Green Day."
2,Best leave this out of your collection,"I was going back and filling in the blanks of my music collection. I heard Minority on the radio and thought this album might not be too bad. I was mistaken. Only the last 3 tracks sound like Green Day songs. Overall, the lyrics are OK, but the songs sound too poppy. ""Warning/ Live without warning"" isn't very creative for a chorus. Saxophone rock-out solo? This is Green Day, right? (see Jackass) Just get the Minority single and leave the rest of the album for someone else's library."
3,Green Day,"I was very disappointed with this cd! I just could not get into it the way I did with Dookie(which I think is their best album!) I think they have matured, not sold out like so many people have said. Bands are supposed to grow and change musically, but they just don't have the same fun energy they used to have and thats what I think made Green Day great! So if you are looking for something more mellow this album is for you, if you want the same Fun energy they used to have, then you will be very dissappointed with this album, like I have been."
5,Whats so bad about it?,"OK i wrote a review for american idiot saying that green day grew up why cant u? punk rock isnt dead and if it was green day didnt kill it. they arent as punk, they matured. i wish a lot of reviewers could mature too! and i can even hear some punk in them in songs like minority and warning. and another thing: how r these guys compared to the backstreet boys? i have heard a lot of green day and none of their stuff sounds like the backstreet boys ok? so if ur a TRUE green day fan buy this cd."
2,Differnt,"I am a huge Green day fan, and i am dissapointed with their new album. There is no punk in it, it is very soft and sort of like pop music. I am sad to say that they are no longer the kings of Punk music."
3,not green dayish,"This is the only review that you will read from an actual green day fan. If you are a green day fan I don't really recommend this cd. It's good but not half as good as their older cd's. My main problem w/ the cd, other than it being too different than earlier green day cd's, was that mike dirnt doesn't play bass as crazy as in all of the other albums. He plays almost exactly the same riff as billie joe on half the tracks.. If you never liked Green day before you'll probably love this album, but a green day fan (a real green day fan) may be dissapointed."
1,Another Album Worth Forgetting About,"After 4 really great punk records and one alternative record, Warning truly is exactly that. This is an album that warns everyone of the creative stand-still Green Day is in at the moment. It seems they have forgotten where they have came from and decided to go after a much older crowd. This mellow record consisting of far-from-witty lyrics and no song writing ability can only cause someone to vomit and pass out. At least that is what happened to me."
1,Terrible Album,"This is not Green Day. Its some acoustic crap album. Not that I have a problem with acoustic stuff, but don't call it Green Day. Call it some other side project."
1,what is the point of this?,will the last Green Day fan please turn off the light on your way out. thank you.
3,Uh yah hi...,"I haven't heard this album in its entirety yet so I'll just assume, like most Green Day, its a fun and conscise pop-punk record, with catchy riffs and great bass lines, but nothing thats going to change the course of rock and roll. The real reason I'm writing is not to review the album. Actually, I just want to ask if I am the only one that immediatley realized that the first track, ""Warning"", is a complete rip-off of ""Picture Book"" (from the Village Green Preservation Society) by the Kinks? For the uneducated, thats the song on the HP digital photography commercials. It's the same song with different lyrics. Come on guys, P. Diddy already tried that, and God knows we don't need more P. Diddy's in the world!"
2,How a great band puts all 3 previous efforts to waste,"This CD isn't nearly as creative as Dookie, Insomniac, or Nimrod. Instead, for this record, they put half of the songs as ""Time of Your Life"" part 2's, or songs that are just pathetic (will somebody explain ""Misery""?). If your gonna get any Green Day record, get any record except for this one. This was such a waste. Even though it's more like 2.5 stars, and it's not terrible, this is Green Day, and they can do 100 times better than this.Favorite songs: Blood Sex and Booze, Fashion Victim, Castaway, Waiting, Minority"
3,They really let me down.,"I thought that I was gonna hear some good stuff from green day now, but I didn't expect to hear this. There's not punk at all on this album, it's basically folk-alternative. With the exception of minority and blood, sex, and booze, the album isn't that great. Don't buy this album expecting the same green day that put out insomniac or dookie."
4,good buy,"i think it is an excellent disc. the songs are original but have th same punk style green day is known for. it isnt their best, but it is definetly worth it!"
4,"Not their best, but very good none-the-less","This is not Green Day's best album. If you are just getting into them, BUY DOOKIE FIRST! This album is more ""complete"", if you could call it that. The other Green Day albums are more punk and have shorter songs, but this album they have made long songs, like 3-4 minutes long. ""Minority"" and ""Blood Sex And Booze"" are the best songs on the album. Once again, this isn't the best album, but it does rank in the top 3, IMHO."
5,"Good God, twee indie folks, where are you?","The Pooh Sticks were fake, like a band created to sell kids a groovy lunchbox and thermos, but they are great, great, great indie bubblegum that makes girls and boys both feel super cool on their Stingray with a banana seat or, if a little more grown up, the scooter. I swear this is the sound of eternal, blissfully ignorant white kids that just want to groove, look at pretty pictures of boys and girls, blush at a stranger, sneak beer, dip their feet in a pond, go steady, break up, roll down the windows, drive fast, take off their shirts and drive slow, kiss under a tree, find a great song on the A.M. radio, pretend they're the lead singer of the greatest band in the world, sell a million records, pick the best groupie and fall asleep perchance to dream of youth again."
4,Great buy,"item was just as described, it saved me over three hundred dollars from Firestone. I will be able to repair four more."
2,"Inrteresting Guitar Work, but Oh, her voice","Got this in the used Blues bin - nothing wrong with that - good way to try artists. I think Sue Foley is a pretty good guitar player. But to my ears, she can't sing. I tried listening to the CD 3 times, but each time I couldn't get past the 3rd or 4th cut before hitting the eject button. She sounds flat/off key until she gets to the end of the chorus/line, then she hits the note but her tone changes - sounds less like a blues singer than a high school jazz singer. I think she would do herself a favor by getting a lead singer with the moxie to carry the music. As I said, she seems to be a pretty good guitar player, but it is hard to get to the guitar because of her voice."
4,Good for Linksys products the same size bad for smaller products,"Had no problems for the most part with these brackets. Some reviewers were concerned about the brackets not fitting some linksys swithces and routers. This is true for the small ones like the EXXS88W 8-port switch. For those you have to use the little notches built into the bracket, which are not that deep and if your wall mounting the switch could fall off. For the larger Linksys routers like the WRT54G it works perfectly."
2,Save your money.,"The fact that it is called a stacking bracket led me to believe that it would be useful for stacking. In fact, it is only useful for stacking some of the smaller footprint Linksys products on top of a full-size one. I was hoping to put it between a couple of full-size units to allow more airflow, but it doesn't work.Also, as for the wall mount feature, the router (or whatever product you mount), is only secured to the bracket by the friction of the four short little legs poked into the four holes on the bracket. There is no additional screw or fastener. Linksys says ""don't put any pressure at all"" on the wall-mounted item.Plus, who needs ten of them?Very limited use for this product, if any."
5,great space saver,I was having difficulty with the fact that the wrt54gs did not have its own place/space. After surfing through amazon I found this wall mount that I thought was perfect for my problem. I have mounted it to the wall and now it is very secure. I have found the solution for my tiny problem.
2,Screws aren't included!,"You would think that when you buy a bracket of any sort, the package would include the mounting screws. Well, this doesn't and you aren't made of aware of that until you open the box. I'm a strong advocate of Linksys products but this falls under the category of ""screw the customer""."
5,Should have come with the router,Using this bracket I was able to wall mount my router and now it is out of the way and less likely to be damaged. It should have been supplied with it!
4,"product works fine, just don't buy from these guys.","Product works fine and the star rating reflects that. The shape itself looks different from the old one I pulled out, but the brackets lined up. Wish amazon had it in stock when I ordered. Wouldn't have to deal with HVAC megastore. If you leave an unfavorable seller rating, they'll email and call you a liar then ask you to remove the rating. Nice.."
4,works OK,"After a year, the unit continues to work as expected. The bearings on the old unit had seized.For installation, you will likely need fire-resistant tape to seal between the unit and the furnace. I bought some from a local fireplace shop."
5,Breakdowns for days.,"A band that has breakdowns that are perfect and doesn't sound a bit mediocre... 7x7x are the answer for your prayers! I ussualy hate most metalcore bands because most of them, sound exectly like ""hate my parents, wearing all black,goth wanna be blackmetal"" types and i look away but with great bands such as blood has been shed,7 angels 7 plagues,between the buried and me"" the red-chord and a few others? We still can hope. Buy it!"
4,Good band,"This is a good metal band. My band played a show with them in Michigan, and they play tight metal with a fair amount of down-time (softer parts). If you like the fusion of hardcore and metal, you'll like them."
1,fine,I haven't seen diabolique movie coz it's too late for me to decide to watch that movie but i found out that is very nice as what my friend said to me
4,Thumbs Up For Diabolique,"Despite criticism that the film is monotonous and boring, I rented the video and was pleasantly surprised. Sharon Stone seems to be getting better every film she does. The chemistry between Stone and Isabelle Adjani is great. Chaz Palminteri is the perfect bad guy and Kathy Bates was a great detective. Listen close, Bates has some of the best lines. I really enjoyed my first viewing. I liked it enough to watch a second and third time!! Big thumbs up to the entire cast for a job well done. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
4,awesome...,"This movie was pretty good. Even though it is in french, the plot is easy to understand. It's a lot like an Alfred Hitchcock movie in a sense that it has a twisted ending. You must buy this movie."
1,Don't waste your time,This remake is NOWHERE as good as the original. What a waste of time . Didn't even finish watching it.Try to watch the original 1960s version.
1,HONTE,ANYTHING but then NOTHING has to see with original Francais - This movie is a shame and really nobody - Especially look at the original with among others Simone Signoret - BUT ESPECIALLY NOT THAT HER(IT) - Christian (France)
3,STONE COLD STONE,"Sharon Stone may be the distaff side to Mickey Rourke. These two performers know how to play sleaze and Stone once again provides a cold-hearted finish to her role in this mediocre version of the French classic. The movie might have had more oomph if they had cast someone other than Isabelle Adjani as her partner in crime. Undeniably beautiful, Adjani just doesn't have the cajones to hold up her end of the movie with the flashy Stone. Another factor is the miscasting of Chazz Palminteri as the worthless husband/lover. He is so wooden in his performance that his fate is neither cheered or jeered. Although the movie gets a boost from the appearance of Kathy Bates as the sly detective, even she can't bring enough life to justify this remake. So why three stars? It held my interest and kept me guessing for a while, but it's strangely convoluted ending doesn't really fulfill the plot's thrust. One plus is Randy Edelman's scrumptious score; it fits the movie perfectly."
2,How come it's that boring?,"This movies is very boring. I saw it with my friends, and most of them ask me what is going on in the movies! Perhaps I am annoyed by my friends so I give a low rating?"
4,Original a Classic Remake is still good too.,"I think people judge this movie too harshly. What? Did people actually expect a remake to outshine the original? If so shame on you. That being said, I thought this remake was done quite well. The cast played their parts well, Stone, Adajani, and Bates were in top notch. These ladies individual and unique were strong in their rolls. I was really impressed with the acting over all. Palmentiri totally put the word ""prick"" to shame. Over all the movie was thrilling and full of tension. I agree that Adajani and Stones relationship could of been pushed more but that aside, the movie was done well. This isn't as great as the classic, though separately I think it was still a good movie."
4,Gift for sharon stone fan,My cousin has a huge crush on Sharon Stone and he really liked the movie and watche it all the way through.
4,Detailed and informative pictures and text,"The pictures are detailed and interesting, showing kids doing just about anything you could do in the early weeks of school---circle, outdoor play, lunch, reading, assembly and even fighting! The text takes you step by step from the first day of school to Christmas break. A note---this school seems like a private religious school, as the children do pray and put on a play about Baby Jesus. One annoying part is the repeated repetition of a whole list of children's names---I am not sure what the point of this is---each time they are referring to the group of children they list each of the nine names---tiring when reading aloud! But an enjoyable good and a good introduction to preschool or kindergarten."
5,Stefanie's Review,This book is a good book for little kids just starting school. It tells them what it will be like in school. My grandma gave me this book when I was going in to kindergarden. I injoyed it then and I still do now. It is still my favorit book.
2,Not for public/secular school readiness,I was hoping this book would be good for preparing my child for kindergarten. The school depicted in the book must be a private Christian school since the kids are shown praying and putting on a Christmas play. Also shows lunch money and other things that seem pretty outdated.
5,You WILL See Results,This is a great workout video. It's easy to follow and Kathy is very pleasant. I've been doing these exercises for about a month and already can see results in my arms. The only drawback is there is not any stomach work in this video.
5,not just for beginners,I started out using this video thinkingit was a great beginner video..but since then i have continued for over the past 3 years to use it..It is a GREAT workout for all exercisers..it got me in the best shape ever...i also run/walk..and use her Claudia schiffer abs tape.Kathy is the best..I love her and her videos..She is not rail thin and offers much encouragement..I want more KK videos..
2,Exercise as Drudgery,"Kathy Kaehler may be a fitness guru and offer a great workout, unfortunately, this video was done before she and her producers got wise to the effects of color and music on the viewer. The exercises in the video are great, no question they work. The production value of the video was very poor though and the video is completely filmed in greys, tans and beiges. If you want a workout tape that visually conveys that working out is a DRUDGERY, then this is the tape for you.I bought this tape after buying and thoroughly enjoying the ""New Dimensions"" tape by Kathy Kaehler with Cindy Crawford. In this newer video, the producers wised up and the tape is filmed in great cool, soothing blues with great scenery (beaches, skylines, etc.) and nice music. I was looking for another tape to add variety, but Target & Tone was not the workout for me!"
4,Nice addition to the collection,"If you're an *NSYNC fan, chances are you've already seen most of the material that's in this DVD. However, it's a nice addition to any *NSYNC collection.The videos include Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna Be Me, This I Promise You, Pop, Gone, Girlfriend, Girlfriend (remix featuring Nelly), This I Promise You (Spanish version) plus two live performances: Pop (2001 Video Music Awards) and Gone (MTV's Road to Celebrity).There aren't any special features besides the videos, except for website mentions and available albums."
5,Nsync's Most Requested Hit Videos,"This DVD, is a perfect stocking stuffer for any Nsync fan. The DVD includes a hit list of the most requested videos. I know all the Nsync fans out there miss the boys. Well this will cheer you up until they come back in 2003. Also other great Nsync items are...Popodyssey Live...The Reel Nsync...Making the Tour...So buy this DVD and HAPPY HOLIDAYS. (December 15,2002)"
3,A little disappointing,"I was a little disappointed when I realized the book I ordered was actually a booklet. The information in the ""other"" two major Chiron books is much more thorough but if your happy and satisfied reading a booklet instead of a real book, then this gives you the cliff's notes version of this powerful little maverick. Considering it was published in 1994 I would've expected it to have more information than the books it followed."
5,whoa....,"While not attaining the perfection of THUNDER AND CONSOLATION (what could?), there is nothing on this album that isn't delivered as if Justin Sullivan's life depended on it. The songs themselves are flawless; ""Innocence"" and ""Vanity"" alone are worth the price. The only flaw here is ""Get Me Out"", and that's only because the live version on ...& NOBODY ELSE is astounding to the point that the original presented here just doesn't compare.Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful."
5,Wicked Cool!,Easy install. THESE WILL BURN A HOLE IN THE FORREST. Super bright. Installed them on a Yamaha Rhino UTV. I ride on the National Forest and in the desert.
1,wrong item for this description,KC Hilites This is not item describedamazon refuses to change or removethat is why i am not using amazon anymorestill not correct decription 7-16-09light bulb burned out in 1 monthwater leaks in lightsstarted rusting in 1 week
2,Mine was made wrong,"I wasted 2 cans of freon with this kit before I discovered it had been made wrong. There is a check valve in the tee that the gage is attached to.In my kit I could read the system pressure but the check valve would not allow the freon to go from the can into the system. Before you attach this kit to a can, and preferrablly before you buy it, open the fitting that attaches to the can and blow into it. You should feel air coming out the end that attaches to the low pressure fitting. If not try another or buy a different kit. The second kit I bought, made by interdynamics, also had a problem in that I had to push the low pressure connector onto the fitting to make it open the schrader valve and allow the freon in. I did get my AC recharged finally and it probably was a lot cheaper than paying some shop even with the two kits and 3 cans of freon but it was harder than it needed to be. Oh the joys of cheap stuff made in China!"
2,Watch out !!! No mention of which a/c fitting is used for your vehicle !!,"I bought this *&^%$ kiit thinking it would fit either my 2005 GMC van or my BMW 324.....both have 14mm A/C fittings...... but noooooooooooooooo this kit has 13.4 mm fitting. WTF ??????Check your fittings befor you buy this kit !!!Mike CecchiniBethesda, Md."
3,"Good Workout, Bad Form","Like the other reviews have stated, you WILL get a good, all-over workout. It'll leave you sore and work muscles that you may not know you have. I would use caution,however:The instructor is very flexible, and I can see some issues with her form. For example, when she in in plank, her elbows are in a near-constant state of hyperextension. Same with her shoulders and neck in cobra. Continuous/habitual hyperextension will lead to injury as well as serious issues later on, many of which can only be corrected with surgery. These are just 2 examples. Unfortunately there are more.I highly recommend taking a barre class, if possible, or doing a Bar Method or Squeeze DVD workout first, then come back to this one. You'll learn proper alignment for the exercises and cut down your risk of injury.(P.S., I'm a Pilates instructor, in case you're wondering where I get off criticizing her alignment, lol!)"
2,Know the details,"I received two of these, one works great, the other display garbage. I thought it could be a bad battery and discovered the battery used in these is very hard to find, even on Amazon. My local stores do not carry them and the replacement batteries (Amazon Resellers) are more expensive than the thermometer. Not a good deal compared with the other themometers that use standard batteries."
2,Just OK Thermometer,"I bought this thermometer to track the high-low temperatures in my freezer. But it does not have a Max/Min reset button. To reset you must open the back and remove the battery and reinsert the battery. This is not easy to do; it is hard to do as the very small button battery has a clip on it.Therefore, I will/can only use it as a digital thermometer."
1,save your money,If you only need to know the temp within 6 degrees this is for you.If you want to know the REAL temp spend your money on something else.This is the worst product I've ever gotten from Amazon.
4,Accurate Thermometer - great deal for price,Not the best thermometer out there but for the price I imagine it's hard to beat. I use it in a kegerator but it has already paid for itself as it helped us to find a leak that was letting out cold air. Temperature appears accurate and we now enjoy tasty and frosty suds.Only problem I have is I wish that the velcro stuck better. Whenever I pull the thermometer off both velcro pieces come with it and I have to reattach the back velcro piece to the wall of the kegerator. A different adhesive would be nice to stop that issue.Overall it does the job as a thermometer and it is a great value.
5,Works great and is _excellent_ for the price!,"This model is cheaper than many analog ones that don't even have a min/max, and while I agree that not having a max/min reset and having to pull out the battery is bone-headed, it isn't that hard, and is not for most of us a frequently needed task. I'll be getting a couple more of these."
5,best taste,"Taste excellent with mix berries and almond milk don't forget the ice, also try the peaches and cream I've lost 20 pounds with this powder shake."
4,"Very realistic, but short on description","This is a very good book. I was interested in the first hand manuscript of this story. I had first read the story 'Follow the River' by James Alexander Thom. This woman's resolve, toughness and love for her family won my heart in this riveting story. I couldn't put it down."
3,Relative,My 6th Great Grandmother is Mary Draper Ingles. A woman of strong will and integrity. We are blessed to have her in our lineage.
2,SEX-ROLES AND GENDER-PERSONALITIES IN OTHER CULTURES,"Sherry B. Ortner & Harriet Whitehead, editorsSexual Meanings:The Cultural Construction of Gender and Sexuality(Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1981) 435 pagesA standard work on anthropology,looking into the sexual customs and patterns of simple tribes.Each culture begins with the biological differences between the sexesand builds elaborate marriage and kinship systems from those facts.If you would like to discover other, perhaps better, books,search the Internet for the following:""SEX ROLE---Bibliography of books"".If you are interested in a different slant,search the Internet for the following exact words:""Best Books on Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
2,It's ok...,"This book was ok. There wasn't really that much information in it. It was a very quick read. I dont really feel like I got much out of it. If you're looking for a quick, simple, easy read - this is it. If you're looking for something more educational and in-depth - this is NOT it."
4,Great Jazz Christmas!,There isn't much to the insert or design on the CD but the music is really nice for relaxing during Christmas time.
3,almost oem fit,the bracket that holds the brake line required a little bending to fit the brake line on. and i thought the valving seems a little soft.
2,HOW TO WASTE $20...,"This book looks GREAT on the outside -- the covers and the binding are truly beautiful...Unfortunately, that's just about its strongest point. The title of this book should be: ""What Freemasonry is NOT""; instead of presenting what Freemasonry is, how it started, and what it actually is, the author devotes 500+ pages and 30+ chapters to presenting 30+ theories of the origin of Freemasonry AND THEN goes on to explain how EACH of these theories, one by one, is flawed, wrong, or otherwise inaccurate. I started reading the book with a clear question in mind: ""What is Freemasonry and where did it start?"". When I finished the book, I was no better off than when I started. The book does a wonderful job of confusing, confounding, clouding, and misinforming, which is really a shame, because I had heard that Mackey was supposed to be quite an authority on Masonic History. Overall, a big waste, and written in archaic language, too."
2,History Book? Nope.,"If you are looking for a history book, then you've come to the wrong place. Basically, it is a chapter by chapter evaluation of the myth of where Freemasonry came from along with Mackey stating at the end, this is not correct. This goes on for each chapter and by the 3rd or 4th, you can just turn to the last page in the chapter and read the synopsis and you will get the gist of the entire chapter."
3,NOT up to standards,"This book was neither extravagantly wonderful or treacherously boring. In fact at the beginning it was exciting and then as the story progressed it became bland. And then there was a sudden turn at the end of the book, where the sheik handed over Halima to Atiya.The story didn't go through smoothly. I can see how some people would like the book, but I would not recommend it."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is aweful! Who wants to hear about a girl dreaming of her lover who leaves to go to college, and he will return in 2 months?"
2,Gimme a nappy roller and some blue paint,"Okay ... Kari Wuhrer is in it and she's a babe. But if you really want to see her act (and who really does) rent Kate's Addiction, or An Ocassional Hell. Throughout this lousy ""art"" film, we see far too much of the lead actor moping around trying to find inspiration. HELLO! Have you seen your girlfriend lately? The film would have been much stronger had the premise been more of a subplot. They needed to focus on Kari and her inner turmoil. At one point in the movie she suggests going dancing and seeing friends. Yes, that's precisely what they should have done. The paint fumes in this movie left me gasping for breath."
4,Luscious aka Vivid,"In case you wanna know, this film was released in 1997 under the title ""Vivid"", and Kari Wuhrer was credited as Kari Salin back then. Due to bad direction and casting, somebody said it could be a career ender for her. Well it was not. She went on appearing in some twenty movies so far (Kate's Addiction, for one, was pretty good). Personally I think this girl is so ""luscious"" we just can't help looking for her although we gave up expecting anything big from her films. ..."
2,Naked girl,In this movie if you want to see Kari Wuhrer naked you will see that but if you are looking for some kind of plot it is lacking there. The guy in this movie is so one dimensional that you don't think he ever got out of the sixth grade. I think this movie would need a lot of work if you wanted to have a plot. They just sit in their apartment and throw paint on each other. I was dissapointed by this one the sex scene were not even that erotic.
2,Not What I Was Expecting Or Wanting,"What the book's title implies: That you'll learn effective communication strategies and skills to speak in an engaging and economical fashion.What this book REALLY is: Speech therapy. It is full of voice exercises, like the ones used by singers before they perform, as well as instruction on how to breathe, etc. All of these are suggestions are fine, I'm sure, but they were totally useless to me.Bottom line: Unless you're looking for voice and breathing technique, skip this book. If you're looking for a book about effective communication strategy, try a book like ""Talk Like A Winner"" instead."
3,A Moderately Good Read,"The story of an art hisorian's personal growth and transformation into a better person than he was previously. Masterful development of characters, and a moderately interesting story, but I never felt like I couldn't put the book down. The ending was realistic, and moderately satisfying. A well-written book, but not as good as some of his other books."
2,Great Visuals-Bad Storyline,"Morris West's ""Master Class"" paints a vivid, if not overworn, plot of an American concubine Max Mathers living in Italy under the shadow of Pia, his elder lover. Upon her death, her will gives him access to any 2 of her antiquities. His knowledge of art finds him 2 rare Rafaels. After that, the plot becomes watered-down to its lowest common denominator. Writer Morris West, however, is incredibly well-knowledgeable and versed in international history and geography. His brush paints vivid charecters within concise arenas. His 'Gisella Mund' is a perfect charecter with incredible insight and depth. Kudos to his genuinity in writing. I only wish the plot equaled his charecters!"
5,A wealth of football information,"If you want to know what the wing-t is and how to use it. There's no better book. This book explains all. For the experienced coach, it helps remind why we chose this offense. For the rookie, it fills you with the basics of this offense. Even if you chose not to run it, there's going to be something you get from this book. And for the defensive coach, well, now you'll see what we want to do to you, so stop us if you can!"
3,Fairly dated,Fairly interesting with some recipes that aren't readily available elsewhere. But many recipes lack precision in terms of ingredient quantity and production processes. Probably of historical note only.
1,"""Total Garbage""Larson Trigonometry 8th Edition Cengage","larson Trigonometry 8th edition Brooks Cole Cengage Learning is the worst book I ever used. I'm taking this course online and the book falls significantly short. I find myself looking for answers to simple concepts that the book leaves out entirely. Totally frustrating, Ive wasted a 100 hours trying to figure things out without the help of this book. You Tube serves as a better resource than this waste of paper. A perfect example of capitalism that hurts my eduacation. Waste of hard earned money.Thanks Brooks Cole Cengage"
3,Lynott & Lizzy,"As you know Phil Lynott (R.I.P) was the singer of Thin Lizzy. His second solo album (Solo in Soho) is much better than the first one, mainly 'cos the songs are more like Thin Lizzy.There are in particular 2 great tracks on this album. The first song ""Dear miss lonely hearts"", that sounds exactly like Lizzy and the musicians are in fact the whole Lizzy band, and the second one: ""King's call"" - a song about Lynott's feelings connected to the death of Elvis Presley.After this very promising opening you think you've found yourself the record of the century, but you haven't... It starts to become more clear why Lynott decided to do a solo album - it was because most of these songs don't fit Thin Lizzy. Some may even think the album contains a lot of strange tunes. Towards the end we got ""Ode to a black man"" and we're (for a while) back to a more traditional Thin Lizzy-feeling.This album is mainly for Thin Lizzy fans."
4,Poetry captured forever,"If you were a fan of ""Thin Lizzy"" then you understand the genius that was Phil Lynott. This solo release, recorded shortly before his untimely death reveals the artists songwriting depth. ""Kings Call"" in particular shows off Mr. Lynott's cretive flair. A tribute to Elvis Presley and now a haunting reminder of the price of fame,""Kings Call"" remains another ""Lost Classic"" by an artist that never really received his due."
4,Worth looking for in a used book store,"I have discovered over the years that there are books I enjoy, and books I FEEL like I SHOULD enjoy. Pangborn's novel Davy falls in the second category. But this collection of his short stories contains some very memorable stories (I remember the last story in the book even as I write this and I haven't looked at the book in at least 10 years.)"
3,Picture is misleading,"Ginseng root is only packed in one row, not as 2 row in the photo. Price is better than buy directly from manufacturer website. Shipping is very fast."
1,Clear plastic cover,I made several attempts to apply the piece to my keyboard. It did not fit and the glue made to stick to the keyboard caused the piece to adhere to itself into a ball. I through it in the garbage.
4,Who doesn't want more energy!,"I really liked the author's approach to developing habits that will give us more energy to accomplish what we want in life. He gives us simple steps that we can follow and instructs us to take what we can from the book. I jumped right into the habits that appealed to me and began incorporating them into my day. I found it simple to do and began seeing results immediately. With all the diet and exercise books on the market today, I found this approach of paying attention to how we respond to the little things in life to increase energy a refreshing alternative."
5,A new take on an old problem,"Bill Ford has managed to come up with a new take on a common problem in our fast-paced society-having the energy to function!As the subtitle states, it's NOT another diet or exercise book, but rather some gentle, friendly advice on how to get out of your own way. Unlike some books written on this topic, it's not overly formulaic. Yes it's about clutter control and time-management, but it's not written by someone pretending to be perfect; he even presents examples from his own life. His idea about focusing on one's strengths rather than weakneses was illuminating...and energy boosting!"
5,This is the best book,"In 6th grade my favorite teacher had our class read my favorite book, The Eyes of the Amaryllis. I liked this book so much that I told my best friend (in another class) that she had to read it. She did and she loved it. And to my teacher's surprise my whole class loved it too! This book will stick with you forever once you read it. The Eyes of the Amaryllis will keep you reading until you finish, and once you finish you will be in awe of what a wonderful book this is! I LOVE this book!"
5,Easy Read (Loved It !!!),"I love this book I read it when I was around 6 or 7 when i had found it in my basement in a basket full of other books. I have read it so much the cover is about to fall off. It is a must read, the story is so lovely about Gran and her never giving up about finding this message even when she brakes her ankle she is so determind and I loved that about her. this is a qwick read and very enjoying. I say every one should read this.I mean I was around 6 When i read this and i new what it was talking about. : )"
5,Natalie Babbit does it again!,"This was a wonderful book! Natalie Babbit is such a good writer, with the most lovely storys.This book is about a gran who loses her husband, ""the Captin"" out at sea.Their are loves in this book, and loses,but at the end, you will love Natalie Babbit."
1,Absolutely Awful,"The film is an affront to the topic of human trafficking! The story line is poorly written with very cheesy dialog never really conveying the absolute terror trafficking victims experience. This is not an educational film about human trafficking so if that's what you're looking for don't buy it. In fact, I don't know the purpose of this film at all and would count it absolutely worthless!"
