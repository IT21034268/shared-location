3,It's A duplication,I am the biggest Dj bobo fan anywhere!! The two CD box is great if you cannot find Dance With Me and There Is A Party.It is those two CD's in a different cover and a collectors box.If you you have those titles then the two CD box won't be of much use to you.Currently there Is A Party is available but Dance with me is very difficult to find so it's your call.If you don't have either of them.just buy the two CD box.
2,"Irwin snips, Lefts and Rights","I have been a union sheet metal worker for some 32 years. The last set of snips I purchased were ""Pro Snips"" by Vice Grip company. These were the best snips I have ever owned. Since Vice Grip was purchased by Irwin their snips have changed dramatically....for the worst I'm afraid. Although I believe these snips have their place, they are not ""heavy duty"" enough for the rigors of day in and day out industrial sheet metal work. They are much to thin to hold up to serious cutting (max thicknesses). I was very disappointed and will be shopping for something different very soon."
1,Damaged Goods,This blouse was beautiful but should never have been sold by Amazon. There were very distinct fade marks on the shoulders and collar. It looked as though this blouse hung on a hanger in the sun for a very long time. Someone in your buying or quality control department neglected to check this merchandise over before listing it for sale on your site. I bought this as a gift for my Mother-in-Law but had to return it. I'm still waiting for my account to be credited and my Mother-in-Law is still waiting for her Christmas gift. This sale was a complete disaster from start to finish.
3,ECUSA Prayer Book 1979,"Latest revision of the Common Book of Prayer for the Episcopal Church, USA, is just another attempt to take the church to the left. I prefer the 1948 with all of its pseudo Elizabethan language.The book is of a very convienent size to take with you, wherever your journey may take you at any given time."
5,Gourmet Jazz,"Jazz magazine critics, spare me the comparisons to other jazz greats. George Kahn's music has a unique style. It's complete.The cuts on this studio album feel almost like they were recorded in a live club. The musicians each flow with the other's talent. Throughout the various cuts each musician comes to the forefront in a relaxed, subtle style. These cuts average between 5 to 7 minutes. As each takes his time, so the artistry unfolds into a sweet sound.George Kahn has real soul for music. The accompanying musicians, Alex Acuna, Justo Almario, Brian Bromberg, John Fumo, and Eric Marienthal bring that soul to life."
2,Not true duets,"Please be aware that this item is not a real Duets BY Patsy Cline CD. These duets were not recorded by/with Patsy Cline during her lifetime but are selections done digitally by a current artist singing along with Cline's recordings, NOT with Cline herself."
2,decent but nothing out of the ordinary,This album is not that bad but it's definately not that great. There are a few tracks that are average and a good bit that are horrible. I've heard worst in my days but this CD is not worth buying.
5,Great upgrade,"From what I heard hawk is the way to go to get good performance for a aggressive driving. have had them for over a year and they are great in snow, wet, dry. note I also did a slotted brake rotor upgrade."
1,springerie rolling pin,"When I got this, it seemed good in theory but I've never been able to get the dough to not stick to the rolling pin, so it just ends up a bit messy & disappointing. It would have been nice if it'd had a silicone coating to help prevent sticking."
4,Really understanding the works of Courtly love,I had to read this book for a project on courtly love. I really enjoyed this book. It taught me a lot about what courtly love is and what it truely means. The poems in it are truely a work of art and really grasp what the true meaning of courtly love is. You need to read this book if you want the absolute most out of what the term courtly love means. I reccomend this highly!
3,Not up to par,"The edition I received should have been near perfectgiven the Cambridge reputation-But the last few pages ofRevelation were mis-cut and wrinkled: also, the seam at backwas coming away at the top and the sewning work was sloppy withstring bowed out..other than these areas, it's fine, just a bitof a let-down for the cost etc."
1,poor materials,"This riveter broke during the first rivet. So it never even worked once. The two screws holding the head on stripped out of the cheap pot metal this item was cast from. Perhaps they stripped them at the factory during there install, but either way you should steer clear."
5,Metal Man,"Great ""pop riveter!"" Very heavy duty, unlike the Harbor Freight riveter I bought (return 2 due to failure in the swivel head). This is one of those tools that should last a lifetime. Great price."
4,Love it & Use it daily; metal frame did break after a year...,"I absolutely LOVE this rack and use it all the time. It holds more than other racks I've used, leaves a light crease in garments but it does not stay (no more than when you fold a shirt). I am online to purchase it for the second time! After a year of regular use, one of the support legs snapped in half. But it is still way better than the wood ones that fall apart in a month, or some of the other metal ones that only hold 8 items at a time!"
2,inconvient,Found the design of this dryer inconvient. I also found it much too small for 2 people to dry clothes that we do not put in the dryer. Thought the Polder two-tier dryer would work as we have limited space.
3,Polder 2 Tier,"Works well, although it is on the narrow side- shirts dont completely fit on the thin easily bent bars.Over all it is made well and of good quality as far as i can see considering I just have it a few weeks"
3,Don't hang anything too heavy!,I like the fact that this folds up so slim and that is why I purchased it but don't put anything too heavy on it (think wet heavy quilt) or it will bend!
1,Quality question,"I ordered 2 of these. One showed up with one of the metal rods detached (someone had put tape on the end to try to keep it attached - nice try!) Also, the plastic ends fall off, so I'll have to glue them back on. This item folds up nicely, but it does not have as much drying space as it appears on it."
3,Functional but not durable,"Aesthetics: 5/5 - sleek, modern finishDurability: 3/5 - one of the minor racks (the thin ones) came unattached on one side; overall, still functionalEase of Use: 3/5 - it is a bit inconvenient to fold and unfold the rack; you have to bend down or use your footWe have had this product for ~3 months and use it lightly about once per week."
5,Great Product,I had purchased this item because i am a soon to be mom and washing baby clothes will be lots of work. With this 2 tier row it works out so great. I had had others but this one is really good. I also have a small dog that loves to play with clothes and with this drying rack you can actually make it higher or lower. this product is great and I will definitly recommend to others
5,great buy!,"Great product for drying clothes indoors since we don't have any room for a clothesline outside. Folds up easily, lightweight and sturdy compared to those plastic ones. I'm glad a found and purchased this product, I use it all the time instead of the dryer to save energy."
3,Pluses and Minuses,"The pluses are that it is well made and came completely assembled and was reasonably priced. The big minus is that the metal bars that you hang the clothes on are so thin that they make creases in the clothes when they are dry. I wish the bars were thicker, I never had this problemw with other wooden clothes drying racks that I used."
2,narrow,"Bought both this polder drying rack and a whitney 5147. Polder is too narrow. Whitney 5147 enables you to hang towels and t-shirts, whereas polder seems to only be good for underwear and socks. Whitney: two thumbs up. Polder: two thumbs down."
3,Whose Quartets?,"The Hagen Quartet plays like one instrument, but their take on the Mozart quartets dedicated to Haydn is all wrong. They attack these pieces with lots of rough bowing and tempo fluctuations. The cellist, in particular, plays much of the time with a ""detache"" stroke which produces a very percussive sound. In certain loud sections the notes disappear altogether and all you hear is bows grinding against strings. It is totally devoid of the elegance and refinement that Mozart needs. As a lover of Mozart, a composer and a string player I find this set less and less satisfying with repeated hearings. The playing in the Gewandhaus set is far more congenial but they only include two of the ""Haydn"" set. Hopefully another quartet will offer a take on these great pieces in the future. In my opinion this set is only a stop gap."
5,Amazing,"Easily one of the best albums I've heard in years. This album is crammed full of MUSIC from start to finish. To corner this album as hip-hip only does it no justice. Yes, there are killer beats and some of the smartest rhymes I've heard anywhere but every track flows together like a urban symphony. I could listen to this whole album over and over and over and never get tired of it. If you don't have this album, GET IT! This album shows you what hip-hop can really achieve."
5,Para aprender a meditar,"¡Fantástico! Para aprender a beneficiarte del mundo de la meditación y de llevarlo a la práctica. Es 100% recomendable. Es fácil de entender.Este libro es una pauta o un medio para llegar a tu objetivo sin que éste sea un impedimento para ello, aprendes también a dejar fuera problemas y estrés."
5,"A Thrilling, Inside Story of Internet Legal Development","""Cyber Rights"" provides a real insider's view aboutthe early development of Internet law in the United States, focusingon free speech, privacy and copyright issues, among others.He notes that some things have changed since he wrote ""Cyber Rights"": ""One of the great ironies of cyberlaw is the extent to which policymakers were panicky about anonymity on the Net in the early 1990s -- nowadays it's increasingly obvious that the Internet is one of the least anonymous places there is, since so much that you do there is archived and recorded."""
5,Fabulous voice!,I adore Dave Loggin's voice! He is an excellent singer and vocalist. His music brings back fond memories of my high school days.
5,Great Album,"This is a great album! I love being able to locate CD's from my old albums. Oh, I remember Dave Loggins well. His easy style of singing and quiet background music is calming to a busy day. I remembered every song as I sang with Dave Loggins while it played through. Please come to Boston and Girl from Knowville remain my favorites."
3,Not quite a one-way ticket,"Dave Loggins has a great voice and has written some wonderful songs, but his best album ever was ""One Way Ticket to Paradise"" - why won't someone re-release that? This'll have to do, I guess."
5,Move over James Patterson!,"Loved this book - I love murder and suspense and am so happy to find a series about an Black detective, written by a black author!!! Keep up the good work - it was well written, suspenseful - everything I look for in a good suspense novel!"
3,Not the best...,"May have spoilers.......This book was very slow. I wanted to stop reading it for a couple times but I didn't. I just think this book was a bit over the top. It had BDSM, and abuse to women. I felt like the author was writing to push the envelope. I don't like that. The author is a good enough writer and the character is built well enough to not have to read it.The good thing about this book was it brought back old characters from other books. It was nice to revisit old characters.Also, Cindy was in the book a lot more than I expected. It felt like she was becoming a major character rather than a minor character. Not a fan of her minor role in general so she was a bit more annoying."
2,Damaged goods,This book is extremely slow moving for my taste with trite handling of subjects that have been to frequently visited by to many medicore authors. The author needs to challenge unique subjects with fresh ideas.
3,I had hoped for more,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I was disappointed at how short it was. I guess I didn't pay much attention to the description of it. The information that is in the book is fun, interesting, and useful, but I would have liked to see a lot more.There are some great examples of clever things people have done, from tricks for reducing friction to examples of using levers and pulleys. But there are only a few of each, and the description of the principles is rather thin."
2,Pretty thin on info.,"If you don,t know anything about the subject, this book might be a start. i i i i i i"
4,Very glad I finally bought this book,"If you are a tinkerer or do-it-yourselfer then spend the $$$ on this book. I learned many things that I have started using and hope to use.Pros:-Well-designed; simple layout, good wording and good illustrations.-Great general info and advice for approaching projects.-Great specific advice about materials, methods and techniques.Cons:-I really wish there was about twice as much info. I would have preferred to pay twice as much for even a third more info. I get the feeling that the author had a lot more to say but decided to keep it short.Overall a great experience, I plan to buy more from the series, starting with the ones on knots."
1,Didn't work for me,I bought this mounting bracket for a small motorcycle size license plate. The slots on the the bracket do not match the holes on the license plate.
5,Makes me glad to be Swedish..,"I decided to check out this unfamiliar band who shared the same heritige as me. (Mind you, this was my intial attraction...but it's like dating...sure they look pretty but it's the mind and the personality that keep you with them - most of the time)After scanning them under the pre-listening station and after having heard just a 30 second blurp of Painted Numbers, I was in mad mad geek love. The sound was bright and fresh, but yet it still contained a substance that is missing in so many bands these days.Maja's raspy/sexy voice really brings you in and keeps you there for the whole song.The intramental aspect is also breathtaking and refreshing.Another point for the Swedes!"
4,Pleasantly Suprised..,So I came across a song by the sounds on a Sound Track and wasnt too sure if I liked it. I found it catchy enough to purchase this album and I was/am very happy with it.Running out of Turbo and Painted Numbers are both brilliant songs. I wouldnt go so far to call The Sounds a stunning band but the music is catchy and I find it great for Summer driving and long trips over the mountains.Overall this cd gets just as much play as my H.I.M CDs do which is quite frequently.
4,Excellent follow up to a great debut,"I just bought this album today and it is great and on par with their first album.The songs Queen of Apology, Painted by Numbers, and Ego are especially great."
3,Where's the label?,"OK -- so I bought this album because my daughter & I heard the song ""painted by numbers"" which is a pretty decent tune. Now, I like a good ""retro-punk"" band (think Joan Jett, Blondie, et al), however, I really can't understand why this album does not have the ""explicit lyrics"" warning -- so far, I've heard the ""f"" word used at least 5 times, and I'm just halfway through the album. It's a decent album, the female lead singer has a nice voice -- but don't buy it for your kiddies!"
3,"""Album Only""??","I heard ""Tony the Beat"" on my local college radio station, and I liked it well enough to Google the lyrics to find the artist. I was planning to buy it here as an MP3, but of all the songs on the album, this is the sole ""Album Only"" track.Uh, earth to decision maker: The days of buying an entire album to get one song are over."
1,Blows Chunks :(,"This really is an unfortunate waste of life. The time spent making this along with any time spent by anybody listening to this is utterly wasted. The time spent writing this is given in the hope of sparing you whoever you are the pain I endured when being exposed to this lame [...]. Its amazing what gets released, record companies will put out any filth if they think some lamo will buy their filth. Comparisons in earlier reviews to Blondie or other talented artists are totally unfounded here....... This band may sound good live, recorded tho the final output is much less forgiving. A fair comparison to this 'music' would be Avril lavigne crossed with mouldy socks, not pleasant and very stinky.Save your money for a more deserving band as there are many, in 5 years no-one will ever rememeber this band I guarantee you. Their albums will abound in every bargain basement bin at 50cents each and that will still be to much....."
4,The Sounds,I saw this band live at a concert. They were the opening act and i wasn't expecting them to be that good. A lead female vocalist is surprising to see as well. Since then i have been addicted to them. First impression is that they have The killers kind of sound to them but definately with songs that are better and a singer who doesn't sound depressed.
3,great sounds but not enough killer tracks,"Love the sound the Sounds get but the only tracks that stick are ""Song With A Mission"" and ""Queen of Apology."" Part of the '00s wave of Swedish rock in the same vein as the Hives, Caesars, etc., but with a somewhat hot rock chick as lead singer tattoos and all.As you can tell by the cover ""sex sells"" (yes, Virginia, those are areolas under that wife beater tank top of the woman on the left) but this is not an overtly sexual record.I think live this band would rock but on record they need to crank up the songwriting chops."
3,Okay,as always with the sounds the lyrics are the worst part. the songs sound almost like something by avril lavigne. the track titled 24 hours is a primery example of this offense. if you just listen to the music and ignore the lyrics this CD can be fun.
5,Great group even live...,"I bought my tickets for the No Doubt/Paramore concert and I knew the sounds were gonna be there so I listen to a few tracks. I feel in love with them!! So I was really expecting them at the concert. I was disappointed they only sanged a couple of songs but to make it up, I bought myself their album. I strongly recommend their albums. They can sing and they have unique music. They're amazing!!!!"
4,"Better then Rubicon, and I look forward to MORE","I became a fan of the Sounds after seeing them headlining for No Doubt.They were a little unpolished, but I bought their latest CD Crossing the Rubicon after the concert. Very Good! I just picked up ""Dying..."" last week....a BETTER CD. I've been listening to it repeatedly and think itsmore FUN then Rubicon. I hope we get to see and hear more from this band.Their blend of Pop, Punk, and synth with an ""attitude"" is great to hearin what is an otherwise dull time for music with corporate rock and Disney...on the airwaves. I might never have heard The Sounds if I hadn't gone to the concert, and that's SAD with so much music being performed.A previous reviewer compared the Sounds to Missing Persons...""maybe"".The Sounds can rock and they have electronic intos that sound likeBlondie at times, though not as ineresting....""yet"". I'll be watching and listening! Atreides"
1,Poor Quality,These are junk. The blades are poorly shaped and have a gap between them. They cut about as well as a pair of pliers. I checked another pair at the store and they have the same defect.Another model from this company was much better (#743C).
5,"Ahhhh, Barcelona!","I recently returned from Barcelona and couldn't be happier to have found this book at my local Williams Sonoma. It's gorgeous and informative and, in addition, has recipes! I feel much better equipped, for my next trip to Barcelona as I'm making lists of eateries not to miss. I'm in the process of ordering Barcelona for my sister and also Rome and Florence for myself. I'm looking forward to trying several recipes in the book, pork loin with peaches, Catalan-style fava beans, marinated olives and especially the cava recipe, ""liquid"" granita of sparkling wine. This book is going to make the coming winter months very warm indeed with marvelous memories of an incredible city and whetting the appetite for future trips."
3,it falls a little short,"i am a huge incubus fan, so i was really excited for the cd to be released. when i got the cd, i was kind of dissappointed. the lyrics seemed to be kind of mainstream pop/boy bandish. there were a few notable great songs like light grenades, which sounds like something from their SCIENCE cd. i also agree that it definitely would have been better had it been longer. i have loved every one of their cds, particularly the last four, but it seems to me that through most of this album, they lost their style that defined them."
3,Light,I like this album because it deals with emotions and feelings all the way through. There is no turn table scratch sound on this album just drums and electric guitars.
5,The band's finest,"There's not a bad song on this album - I would not be able to praise it highly enough if I tried.It is one of those rare albums which is an instant hook almost all the way through, and one that grows on you at the same time. Nothing but highlights here, no filler at all. The band's in incredible form here, this should have a 4.5 star average here, I'm surprised it doesn't.Can't wait for the next album. You don't need other bands when you have Incubus."
2,Single is Great!! but the cd itself sucks,"I was excited when i first heard the single ANna Molly, i mean whats not to like. But as soon as i listened to some of the other songs on the cd i was disapointed quickly. I don't know what they were thinking putting out a really good single to get people to buy the album, than there is just a bunch of crap to disapoint people who bought? I think some people just made a mistake letting all the crappy songs on a cd that people had to buy just for a bunch of disapointing songs."
2,Not impressed,"This record is even worse than Crow Left of the Murder. The songs are slow, or boring and nothing really stands out. Incubus is nothing more than a pretentious rock band who after a couple hit albums (Make Yourself, Morning View) have done everything in their power to NOT have a hit record again. There's nothing wrong with having some commercial appeal is there? If they keep making records that noone wants to listen to they will lose their record contract and the band will be over. Light Grenades had the biggest second sales dip in billboard history! It dropped from 1 to 37. Some incubus fans are so fanatical they like ANYTHING that incubus does. I just think its so pompous to ignore your fans by making weird records just to look ""cool"". Its sad when the only people that like your albums are music critics. I'm so over this band."
2,case cracked,the cd is good but the case is cracked so that is pretty much not worth the buy so i'm mad
3,A realistic look at this album,"Ok, Incubus has been around for ages now it seems, and one this I know is that these guys make singles like few others. If you make the list, it's a long one, and an impressive one.Incubus is one of my favorite bands, second to only Kaddisfly, and I like this album. ""Anna Molly"", ""Dig"", and ""A Kiss to Send us Off"" are really, really impressive singles. You've got your typical Incubus experimental tracks, ""Light Grenades"" and ""Pendulous Threads"", that half-single half-forgettable tracks ""Rogues"", and then the filler love stuff that comes on every album they've released in the last 8 years.The problem I have with the album is that it too quickly went right into my normal play list and saw infrequent play time. I never searched out songs, with the exception of Pendulous Threads, and that's why this is a 3 .5, not a 5.Pick the album up, it's a good listen, but nothing special, nothing you'll listen to all the time."
3,eh: very good but with two blemishes,"i think Light Grenades is a very good and very well put together album, my only complaint is that Earth to Bella pretty much destroys it(Boyd sounds like he's whining!, almost reminds me of the Stones with Angie), every other track is good. I do agree with other users in that some tracks sound crowish, but overall its a good album, not their best, but good nonetheless."
4,Well,"I bought this CD for my girlfriend(who is a huge Incubus fan) and she loved it,she went on to tell me that it wasnt Incubus' best CD,but it was sill pretty good.Im not an Incubus fan like her but I do like some of their songs anyways if your an Incubus fan then its prolly a must-buy for you."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be their ""Hardest Album Yet""","First of all, I have never heard so much whining about love in one album. I love Incubus and I have been waiting for this release with great anticipation. The only problem is that ""Lights Grenades"" is the only track that I can enjoy listening to over and over. They lost their style in this one and I am very disappointed. I just hope that when I see them in concert that they rock this stuff out, and aren't the pussies they portray in their new album."
2,"WARNING, stay away from this one.","First I am a huge fan, saw Incubus a few times in concert, have every CD/DVD and a bunch of live boot legs. Folks, this record is bad..real bad. What happened to Incubus?? Where's Kilmore? Where's Brandon's surf rock voice? The main problem is the overall structure of the songs is ""CHORUS-LESS"". You guys will go back to listening to their old records. This will be their worst selling record. Take that to the bank! Trust me, listen before you buy..I didn't think Incubus could make such a bad record. Every band goes through this. Incubus will be back....we can only hope."
3,Mixed results on 2006 offering.,"The first half of this album is great. Exactly the sort of catchy songs that you'd expect from them. ""A Kiss to Send Us Off"" is a strong opening track, ""Dig"" explores the territory of previous hit ""Drive"", ""Anna Molly"" is the standout track on the album, with a clever play on words, and ""Love Hurts"" is an excellent ballad. There are a few more songs that I thought were pretty good, but the rest of the album seems like weak B-side material. Corny song names like ""Oil & Water"" and ""Diamonds and Coal"" don't help either.I think Incubus is a great band, but they should have waited until they had a full album of above average songs before releasing it. As it stands, I give the first half a 4.5, and the second a 2.5. Check out the songs first before buying, and maybe you'll like the whole thing, what do I know? But I think most will agree that there are only 5 good songs on here."
3,Ehhh...,"I agree with some of the other reviewers in that you can't really compare the previous albums with eachother because they each have a slightly different sound. BUT I do not think this is Incubus' best work...at all. First of all the album itself is incredibly short with only 13 songs. As soon as I heard the first song I recognized Boyd's voice was different; more trained if you will. I don't think that any of the other guys' talents shine through and the lyrics are rather cliche, as the title ""Love Hurts"" blatantly exemplifies. I do really love ""Oil and Water"" and ""Dig"" for their different sounds, but the ""Earth to Bella"" 1 and 2 are completely not needed. I mean I understand the whole point of releasing new music is to show growth, but I think its debatable whether Incubus has grown beyond recognition."
3,Not Incubus best album,"It didn't win over as the other albums did (Make Yourself, ACLOTM)..But of course, they're always Incubus :)"
3,I hate doing this...,"but this is what I believe to be Incubus's worst album. No, it is not terrible by any means, but I loved and I mean LOVED A Crow Left of the Murder but this is going back a step. Crow was a very experimental album with an array of sounds, somethign you don't find with a lot of mainstream bands but I loved it. This, on the other hand is what I like to call the sell-out album. It's way too commercial for them. There are a couple good songs like ""Dig"", ""love hurts"" and of course, ""Anna Molly"" but there isn't enough on here. And another thing that bothered me, albeit stupid is it's really damn short. Sorta feels rushed to me. Most Incubus CDs are very solid from beginning to end and a good length but this just has a couple of good songs and too much filler and not enough thought put into it. Hopefully, for the next album they can put more effort into it."
4,60%-40%,"I bought this CD because I really like Incubus.I thought it would be a bit like the last albums, that I would have to listen to it for a while before loving every single track.Well, it's been a bit different: there are a couple of tracks that I really LOVE but, the rest of the tracks are quite difficult to listen to.Before buying this CD I would recommend that you try to listen to the whole album! Good Luck"
3,"Some notable songs, NOT their best, but GOOD","3.75/5 starsI am an amateur Incubus fan, and I just really got into them. I loved SCIENCE, Make Yourself, and Morning View. But not so much Crow Left of a Murder. Light Grenades in my opinion is better than Crow Left of the Murder, but nevertheless falls short of the previous three albums. Despite previous reviews, I liked Earth to Bella Part 1, however it does become a bit redundant. But the tracks like Dig and Anna Molly are my favorites. Not as hard as their earlier works, I still find it a worthwhile album to listen to. Love Hurts also grew on me, but stay away from Part 2 of Earth to Bella and Quicksand. The rest seem to have some potential. Rogues kinda grew on me...Of course it depends on the fan. Sample it a bit and then make your decision.My Good Song List: (not quite in order)1. Anna Molly2. Dig3. Love Hurts4. Earth To Bella (part 1 ONLY)5. Rogues6. Pendelous ThreadsBeware! Bad Songs:1. Quicksand2. Part 2 Earth to Bella3. Oil and Water"
2,Jesus.,"Jesus this is horrible Cd. I loved Incubus when they first came out but slowly I realized there would never be another: Enjoy Incubus, Fungus, or S.C.I.E.N.C.E album ever again. Don't get me wrong I don't think that they need to repeat every album but come on! You can only write so many love songs for god's sake. This Cd makes me really think that they have run out of creative ideas and now they are doing whatever they can to get on the radio."
1,save your money,"There is only ONE great song on this CD, in my opinion,.and that is ""Anna Molly"". Which is the reason I purchased it in the first place. I thought I'd like the rest of the songs,.and I tried to,.but I can't. the rest of this CD just plain sucks."
1,Amazing!,Wow this new Maroon 5 album is intense. Is this really the same band that put out S.C.I.E.N.C.E? You can say this band has matured.. I really just call it the biggest sell out in the history of rock. Congrats guys.. Loved the latest Gap commercial Brandon.
5,A Bright Light,"Being Bright is not Enough is a good text book that helps with the doctoral program oriention. Although it is a required text, it is a very informative and enjoyable book. A keeper!Pleas, Praises and Promises"
2,"Too much, too convoluted, too metaphorical","Get ready to suspend reality in this heavy-ladened, multi-plotted at-times tedious espionage/thriller. And I do agree with many others, the title is totally misleading.There is little doubt one would guess this is the author's first book. The metaphors are more than the grains of sand on a beach, the suspension of reality and lack of knowledge (or ignorance) on the part of the author is evident - I cannot believe how he describes the Old Executive Office Building. In another part of the book, one of the characters is a family man who would never engage in a certain behavior. Yet, pages earlier, we find out the same guy was involved with a prostitute.I didn't finish this book when I first took it out the hardcover from the library - and now I went and waste money to buy it. I should have trusted my first instinct. Save your money. I hope Damage Control is a big improvement for Mr. Dugoni."
3,THE JURY MASTER MASTERS LITTLE,"I really thought with the great reviews I was about to read a legal thrill about a great attorney, boy way off here. Not a horrible book for an early effort by the author but miss titled and billed. This is an action shoot'em up that is so illogical that it is almost like a cartoon. Dugoni can spin a word but the story is just too incredible to believe. Starts out about a lawyer that never loses....that hardly lasts a chapter and then the story doesn't know where it wants to go, the the court room sure isn't the place. Getting into the White House with fake names and ID's is just an example of the non sense here. Very tough to accept."
1,BORING,"I was looking for a legal thriller (wouldn't you think with the word ""jury"" in the title that it would have something to do with that?""Anyway -- read a couple of chapters. Not worth my time. He doesn't compare to the good thriller writers out there."
2,These other reviewers are friends of the author....,"1) The book throws out a lot of characters early on but accompanied by such a lack of motivations or past it's hard to stay interested.2) At more than halfway through the book, there are so many disconnected plot threads you feel like you are finally going to learn something...instead...you get MORE shady characters!3) Good thrillers keep you entertained because skilled writers know how to slowly give out just enough information to keep you guessing. This guy keeps it all to himself.4) The author tries James Patterson's style of 4-5 page chapters, but all he does is frustrate you because he keeps cutting away from something happening. Perfect for people with A.D.D.I give it two stars because some of the action scenes aren't bad, but just as something interesting starts happening, it cuts to something else."
5,The Jury Master,Absolutely loved this book. Have already checked when his next one will be out so I can purchase it. Very exciting.
4,Suspense...and then some!,Keeps you guessing to the end! Grabs your attention and doesn't let go - great read!
5,Masterful Thriller,"This book is a compelling read. The pacing is excellent and never lets you out. The three story lines are interesting standing alone, but when woven together in the masterful way that Bob Dugoni has accomplished here tell a fascinating story. As a first novel for a new writer, it is an amazingly well crafted effort. The dialogue flows and is believable. The characters are fully fleshed out. The writer never lets the story devolve into any superfluous derivative. It doesn't try to be too clever for its own good. It doesn't try to squeeze meaning out of plot. Its just a well written, clean thriller that I thoroughly enjoyed reading and which I whipped through in about 10 days. This book deserves all the praise that it is receiving, and is defintely worth the investment of time. I am looking forward to the next installment."
5,Page Turning Thriller,I loved this book from the first page to the last word. The characters were well developed and the plot unfolds in a building intensity that kept me turning the pages. This is one of the best thrillers I've read in years. David Sloane is a wonderful character. When is he coming back?
4,"Thrills, but not a Legal Thriller","Robert Dugoni's debut novel is an entertaining conspiracy thriller that apart from the protagonist's job, the opening chapter, and the last four paragraphs of the epilogue has nothing to do with courts, lawyers, or trials. This is a political thriller through and through, so be aware of that fact.The book starts off as a lot of thrillers do, introducing us to the different characters from around the country who will eventually find their lives intertwined. There are lots of action scenes, some obligatory, obvious, and unbelievable love stories, and dialogue that mostly rings true.Dugoni has crafted an entertaining and fast-paced thriller here, and although there are warts on the finished product I'll be looking forward to his next book."
2,A COMPLETELY MISLEADING TITLE!,"After the first few pages of the Jury Master, this lengthy, complicated read has nothing to do with juries or the courtroom.The blurb writers who describe it as a ""legal"" thriller obviously did not read it. It was very disappointing to be so thoroughly misled by reviews and a promising first few pages of the story!"
3,"Smooth plot, unbelievable story","The jacket makes a big deal out of David Sloane's almost supernatural ability to sway juries to verdicts they might otherwise not have arrived at. And the first dozen or so pages of the novel describe that ability. But no mention of it is made again until just before the end of this rather unbelievable tale, and then not in anything close to a legal context.There are no holes in the storyline; you can follow it without any difficulty. But the coincidences and conspiracies keep on coming, one after the other, without any letup. This book makes David Baldacci's ""The Camel Club"" look like a piece of classic literature. The only reason it gets three stars is because of the seamless storyline and the action sequences."
1,Kindle owners beware,This book does not download to kindle format correctly making it difficult to read. For the price I hate to give up but it is a struggle.
5,"Awesome, edge-of-your seat legal thriller","David Sloane is an in-demand trial attorney with masterful speaking skills. He will win cases where other might not. David sometimes is haunted by his conscience as well as memories he cannot figure out. It's endearing his relationship with Melda since he has no other family. Tina is his faithful assistant who has loved him from a distance. Joe Brannick, a close friend of the President is found dead, supposedly a suicide in a National Park. David had received a phone message from Brannick and a package. Dangerous people want to know why Brannick called Sloane. Tommy Molia, a West Virginia detective also gets involved when told to back away from the case. It's an exciting, engaging novel that you won't want to put down!"
2,no no no,"The title is apparently for another book, since it doesnt apply to this one at all. We are told twice by the main character that he is a whiz in the courtroom and another comments that she doesnt know how on earth he talked his way into a meeting...but thats it. This is not a courtroom thriller, in fact there is no thrill, no nothing. It is not believable, in fact a bit insulting--there were too many leaps needed for any of it to work and I'm so tired of all the cliches."
4,"A wonderful intertwined web of characters, story-line and drama",What courtroom junkie would not love this novel of clever chaos and mind boggling expertise. Robert Dugoni's prose shines and kept me turning pages to the end. And then I was sorry I had finished it and wanted to start from the beginning to savour it even more. I can assure you I will read it again but I am on to the next one.His character David Sloane is indeed a very especially gifted lawyer and his personal life gives depth and meaning to an already finely conceived plot.I enjoyed it immensely and hope to enjoy Robert's writing for years to come. My thanks to him for his skill and dedication.I would write more but to give away any of the plot would be a miscarriage of justice.
2,A hard book,"Remember when you were a kid and you used to complain about certain books being ""too hard""? That's this one. Cast of dozens, too many plot twists and turns......it was so convoluted it couldn't keep my attention very well. There's a good book in here if only it had enjoyed some streamlining and editing so it could move right along."
3,Not As Good As Expected,"I think this is really a 2 and 1/2 star book. It is a promising first novel, but does not live up to all these four and five stars others have awarded it. There are some good action scenes, but some of the motives are a bit too much to handle. There is a lot of jumping back and forth from character to character and location to location. And there are a lot of characters to keep track off. I would expect this author to improve over time."
1,Waste of time and money,An incoherent collection of superficial technical jargon.If you are looking for guidance in client/server or intranet development there will be nothing of value in this book.
4,Easy Read on a Complex Subject,"This book covers great spans of time and geography and illuminates little discussed, but important and interesting, stretches of history. I found it an easy read, despite the complexity and many characters.The only downside is that more detailed maps, and perhaps a timeline, would have been useful."
5,And now the AC works,"Had been putting off trying to fix the AC and heat unit. Fan would occasionally turn on, so appeared to be the controller bax. Found the proper box easily on Amazon.com. Arrived quickly, but unsure of how to install. Waited until a friend, who works on cars, came over. The repair went quickly. Dash snapped off, slipped over steering wheel easily. Old box snapped out and the new box snapped back in. Dash snapped back on and tested unit. With the simplicity of repair, I am somewhat irritated at myself for putting off ordering the part and doing he repair. But glad to get both AC and heat working on demand, and not only when the short wanted to work."
1,3rd unit,This is the 3rd unit I have ordered and they all seem not to work at different levels. This last one only worked for a month before two levels stopped...medium low and medium high. I can only get low and high to work. The 2nd unit I returned because it stopped too and I returned it.
5,Works like it should!,Arrived a day earlier than promised at a price $80 less than the local parts shop. Can't beat OEM quality and amazon prices!
1,Heater control unit.,"This product was supposed to be the right one for my vehicle, but it is completely wrong. Now I have to send it back at my own expense, even though it was advertised to be for my vehicle."
3,spend the money and buy a better quality pad,Overall the quality is good no noise whatsoever. They do produce as much dust as the stock pads did. I personally would spend a little more money and get a better quality pad.
4,Nice but a bit noisy,"We have 2007 BMW Z4 Sport Package, and we've just installed these brakes only few days ago. My mechanic loves them. He thinks they're great and proven brand. Definitively better stopping power then OEM bimmer brakes, at least 20% better is my guesstimate. I don't like fact that I hear some noise and also have slight grinding feel in brake pedal (only) when breaking slowly. When done aggressively can't hear nothing, just smooth. One star off for that grinding impression when braking slowly."
3,Was expecting a little more.,"Never really felt like the main character was really tested to earn the stones and part could be the fact the movie time frame does not allow for real dept considering there were like seven stones he had to earn. Plus the intro of characters and the final battle. This would have been better as a 10 to 12 episode.There were some dragons in it but only in the background of the store. The title after all is Dragon Quest and you would think it would have a little more to do with dragons.Special effects were ok and for the most part so was the acting with the exception of a few characters. Especially the one character that was known to everyone as ""grandfather."" Which you would think they could have least come up with a half decent name for him.The song that was played during the ending credits has a decent beat to it.If you want to get this movie on DVD, don't pay no more the $5.00."
2,"""YOU MAY CALL ME STRANGER.""","The plot is an adaptation of ""Star Wars"" (Hans and Princess Leia combined into one character), for a middle earth movie complete with bad dragons, a quirky Yoda-like instructor, and a boy who must be taught, who isn't ready. The acting is bad. The dragon, fight scenes, and blood are all CG effects, and not very good ones at that. The movie certainly has some MST, it might be funny if stoned quality to it. But for the normal sober viewer this is a big time avoid.In the beginning our horn-dog hero is spying on a young topless girl, then later he won't get into a bath tub with a major league babe. The movie has some gem lines: ""You may call me...Stranger."" or ""You must continue along this route until...you find shelter.""No F-bombs, no sex, was that brief teaser nudity in the beginning?"
3,"Not good, but at times so funny","Ok, I wasn't expecting much, and there wasn't much to Dragonquest. However, Marc Singer's character in it is too bizzare! He seems to shift from a more grizzled form of yoda to a crazy irishman, and that I found to be priceless."
1,Oops I ordered the wrong film,"OMG, I mistook this for another film and I couldn't even watch this all the way through. This is garbage, AVOID AVOID. Oh well lesson to me for being click happy. ;("
2,Asylum needs to find a new CGI character,"They have milked the dragon model to death. It's actually more impressive in the animatics than in the movie.I'm actually a fan of most of their ""mockbusters"" but this was a waste of time. First one that had me fast forwarding through it."
1,PRETTY BAD,HORRIBLE CGI AND AWFUL SCRIPT AND ACTING COMBINE TO MAKE THIS A REAL HOWLER. MARC SINGER USES A WICKED SNARL AND SPOUTS RIDICULOUS PLATITUDES AND HAS ONE OF THE WORST DEATH SCENES EVER. VILLAIN BRIAN THOMPSON HIDES WISELY BEHIND A HOODED ROBE AND LOOKS EMBARRASSED. THE DRAGON EFFECTS AND THE BATTLE SCENES ARE ATROCIOUS. AVOID.
2,Snips.....Part 2,"I have been a union sheet metal worker for some 32 years. The last set of snips I purchased were ""Pro Snips"" by Vice Grip company. These were the best snips I have ever owned. Since Vice Grip was purchased by Irwin their snips have changed dramatically....for the worst I'm afraid. Although I believe these snips have their place, they are not ""heavy duty"" enough for the rigors of day in and day out industrial sheet metal work. They are much to thin to hold up to serious cutting (max thicknesses). I was very disappointed and will be shopping for something different very soon."
2,Not the same as the original,"I bought the original version of this little treasure for my children when they were wee. It was a wonderful book we read again and again until the board pages were well worn. It's a memory my children and I will cherish forever.I wanted to offer this same opportunity for a new mother and child I know, but I was disappointed to find that what I received in my new order was not the same version my family and I came to know and love. Though the pages were indeed the same exact ones in the book we owned years ago, there were several pages missing! My rating reflects the new 2002 version which is not nearly as perfect as the original version."
2,Hmmmm,"I had high hopes for this little story. It turned out to be a bit of a let down. Price is way too high for this small book. It had potential to be a lovely little story, but it seems to be missing something. Pages are very thick, blue and green foam glued together. I teach a toddler class and found children trying to separate the blue from the green as though they were different pages."
1,Where are the missing pages!!,"My teenager grew up with this book, and I purchased this for a new baby in the family - SO WISH I had read the reviews and realized that this is NOT the same book. It has been cut down, and not only are some favorite lines gone, it just sounds wierd! It just suddenly ends, and is clear that the last few pages are missing....plus, the pages aren't just chunky, their bizarre - overly thick, almost foam like. I'll be returning this one and gluing my old one back together. Will keep my eyes open for a better edition."
3,Fast paced great characters,I initially watched this to see Claudia Karvan in a further role after she impressed me in The Secret Life of Us. I found that this film has strong characters with all three leads including Bryan Brown and Tom Long being equally effective. The story is well paced with constant development of the plot and a good ending. The DVD main film sounds and looks good with a reasonable making of feature. The trailer is standard theatre fodder. A cast biography may have helped. The excellent characterisations make the normally dull insurance office world seem very plausible.Good on yer blue.
5,Brilliant book,I absolutely loved this book. I read it with amazement as I compared the events of my time in Zimbabwe to the behind the scenes information presented in the book. I was amazed at just how much was never put on air for the general public to be aware of and also to know the depth of the people's convictions (even when they are wrong) and their willingness to act it out was very intriguing to me. Well written book I even learnt some things about my history I was unaware of. I can't wait for the next book.
4,An Appreciation for Vintage Music,"This disc is the soundtrack of one of the best documentaries of all time so naturally the soundtrack has to be just as great,and it is.While even Terry Zwigoff himself says that because editing a movie can take so long at least the music should be something you could listen to over and over again.Being a collector of vintage music on old 78`s,he used originals when he could (like the spooky and incredible Last Kind Word Blues) and had modern musicians interpret on,piano and guitar, some really fine jazz and blues songs from the 20`s and early 30`s from the likes of originators like Jelly Roll Morton,Scott Joplin and Joseph Lamb.Add in a couple of songs from the Cheap Suit Serenaders (an old time string band that includes Zwigoff and Crumb)and you have a great cross section of really great music.The film is worth a peek and the Cheap Suit Serenaders are also worth checking out if you love this old time music as much as I do.Have fun."
3,Great little tool,If you need a hand on cracking seafood shells this is the perfect tool and it's a very durable product i recommnd it ..great for a gift also
2,Ugly and Old,After one crab feed the forks and part of the crackers look 100 years old. They're tarnished and looks like the outer layer is going to peel off into your food. I had to throw them away.
5,seeds of singing,"i also loaned my copy out and never got it back. i bought another from amazon finally and wheni finished reading the book again, i just wanted to start all over. it was as good as i remembered.i rate it my #1 all time favorite book for sure. i can't find any more books by kay mcgrath...doesany one have more info on her? or is this the only book she wrote?"
2,CENSORED - DO NOT BUY,"This is a ""partial"" waste of money. Tracks that contain profanity are censored.Like the first reviewer, I don't understand why Tommy Boy even bothered to release this.This is a comprehensive release. I love all the tracks. But the censorship completely ruins some of the tracks. For example, Tim Dog's ""F**k Compton"" is completely ruined.There is also no disclaimer stating that tracks are censored. Isn't this unethical.My advice - do not buy.Tommy Boy needs to set this straight."
3,"works ok, not exactly as advertised","I just received the hot/cold sinus mask today. It's not exactly as pictured.This is not the sellers doing, the product doesn't even match the picture onthe package. It's basically a bean bag, these pics all show extra stitching asif there are compartments to hold the contents from swishing around freely,mask received does not. Also it's kind of heavy on the eyes(maybe because my eyes are sore?)Anyway, it holds heat a lot longer than other things I've used. Caution, itsays to heat for one minute, if not enough, heat another 30 secs. One minutewas more than enough, I had to let it cool, felt like I was burning my eyes."
4,Relief for a good friend,"When I visited my friend in Indiana recently, she complained of sinus headaches and her eyes were swollen nearly shut. I had this sent to her and she recently told me that she could not thank me enough. Most of the swelling is gone and she no longer has headaches as often. Thanks from her and me."
4,Thermalon Sinus Mask,"I loved it. Helped relieve the pressure in my forehead in about 20 min. The best part, is there is no smell. Unlike other products that I have used, this one was easy to keep on my face."
4,Helps Sinuses,"I've had severe sinus problems for a number of years and this is great for applying heat or cold on the face. I almost wish it was big enough to wrap around the temples as well...this just covers the eyes and cheeks so it doesn't soothe everywhere that hurts. Next time I would look into finding something slightly bigger, but this works good too."
4,Native American Classic,"Having read this classic many years ago, I had the opportunity to read it to my children again. It still raised my imagination, leaving the feeling of the deep woods and crafty, dangerous indians lurking about. It is a great adventure, with immortal characters, burdened with their own faults and fates. Cooper was a masterful storyteller if somewhat historically inaccurate, for his readers enjoyment. The noble savage as portrayed here swept the country's imagination for many decades.George E. Miller, author of The Lone War Cry"
3,Lengthy but not without merits,"For its time, Last of the Mohicans is among the best American literary pieces we have, but many contemporary readers will not appreciate it for this value. While the storyline is interesting, it does drag on at points by providing too much detail not vital to the storyline. The historical accuracy is in question, but historians disagree constantly based on their bias. Since I am not a big fan of this time period, I found it difficult to get through but this does not mean it was a poorly written book. It does have value in its representation of Native Americans, their interaction with the Europeans settlers as well as the relations between colonists and the British authorities. This book is a classic as has been said many times before but the 1992 movie adaptation ruined it for many readers."
2,Not as good as the movie,"I adore the movie & wanted to love the book, but just couldn't. It just seemed monotonous & flat, almost too detailed sometimes in a boring way ... like Moby Dick (sorry to fans). I had to force myself to finish it, there wasn't enough complexity or realism to the characters but perhaps that is because I saw the movie first so had high expectations. I always recommend reading the book if you watch a movie based on one & usually the book is better, but for me this was the exception."
4,At Last A Truthful View!,"I grew up reading the Longstockings Saga. As an African American mixed with Native American, there was much pain in my reading. I thought that this was a true image of the Native American, whites, and the few Negroes who were mentioned. Although Chingachgook and his son, Uncas are depicted as proud and pure, they never seemed to be equal to Deerslayer.I also bought the DVD with Daniel Day-Lewis, in which Uncas dies and there is a painful speech given at the end which offers no hope for the Native American. Then I read the introduction of Stephen Railton. What a revelation tnat was! How much research did John Fenimore Cooper do on the Native American tribes he describes as being so terrible in his writing? I can remember trembling as a young student reading of his Mingowarriors! Mr. Railton sheds much light and truth on the subject... Yes, the Last of the Mohicans is an exciting story, but it would have been better well research, with honest views of that period."
3,The last of the mohicans,The aouthor is James Cooper he wrote four other books in this seiries that i have not read. This book is about a major in the british army during the french and indian war he is escorting two of the genrals daughtera to a fort but there guide led them into a trap three men came to save them one was named Natty the other two were named Chingachgook and uncas. The aouthor wanted to educate people on this time period. I found that this book was agood adventure but it is not good inless you are an advanced reader because there is alot of difficult words in the book .
2,good looking and warm,but weeks in to wearing them the seams in the fingers are coming apart...I only wear them for driving and between the car and where ever I'm going so it's not like they are being abused...I'm disappointed...
5,Hope I never have to use this.,"I live within a ten mile radius of Indian Point nuclear power plant on the Hudson River in NY. I hope I never need this product yet as the Boy Scouts teach, Be Prepared! Nicely packaged, prompt delivery, reasonable price."
5,NOT something you want a medkit to be without...,"Used to prevent thyroid damage from radiation poisoning and although commonly found in many conventional foodstuffs, the Potassium Iodide - NOT IODINE - tablets are a MUST for any type of disaster preparedness kit. For no more than it costs...for the love of God...why WOULDN'T you add these to yours???"
1,Inaccurate Description,"Current product description claims ""(Pack of 2)"", with a ""2 Pack"" image. This is inaccurate.I placed an order for 10 (Pack of 2). I received 10 packs. 10 individual packs of 14 tabs each. Where is the 2 pack? 14 tabs is what all similar products provide in an individual package.Don't expect to receive a ""2 pack"" for each Qty of 1. You will receive one package with 14 tabs for each ""2 Pack"" you order.Consider iOSAT Potassium Iodide Tablets, 130 mg (14 Tablets), which at the time of this writing is a much cheaper alternative."
5,I hope it works as described.,"To clarify the negative reviews, this is 2 packages of 14 tablets, 28 tablets in ONE order. I can not attest to the effectiveness of this product and I hope to never have to use it."
5,Product Looks Good (but don't buy from HealthMegaMall),"Hope I never need to know if this product works, but the packaging and appearance were as described online once I finally received the product.The company I ordered this product from, HealthMegaMall, tried to profiteer off the death and misery of the Japan tsunami and nuclear reactor meltdown victims. They should have been banned from Amazon, but I guess the fact that they have not (as of Dec 2011) tells you a little something about Amazon as well."
5,Inexpensive,"This was relatively inexpensive. You get 2 packs of 14.Really, how can you know how good this is unless you actually have to use it. But, it meets all the medical requirements for the product.You should really google information on how it works, side effects, dosages and so on."
2,Dissapointed - Product Does Not Ship AS PROMISED!,"Slow Shipping!!!! Took over a month to get product!! If you are out of stock, let it be known that"" This Item is on Backorder"" I am a seller as well and know when I get an order I ship as promised. Also, In product description, It should state somewhere that This Item is stored where People Smoke. I have allergies to ciggerette smoke and the package carried a heavy smoke smell! I hope with all these negative remarks, this seller can take these comments to make shopping a better experiance."
2,Wrong description,"If you're looking for a strap for your SLR, you're in the wrong spot. This is meant for looking like a fool with a point and shoot. I've never been in such pain from carrying around my point and shoot in my pants pocket that I thought, ""Self, what if we could strap it around my neck so I can use my pants pockets for a sandwich instead?"" If you wear fanny packs, this is for you. Return shipping is more than the price of the item."
4,Good Enough,"Nice to have the movie in DVD form. There is a problem with the color flashing and changing in the last part of the movie for several minutes, almost long enough to say I can't watch this anymore but not quite. Overall though a decent product."
5,It's a must,"For old fans of 70's rock and roll, this is a masterpiece. Do not lose it.It's one of the best BS work."
3,2/3 Blessed,"When I picked up this book I figured it would be three heartwarming easy to read though probably predictable stories. I was not disappointed in that regard. However, I was disappointed in the first of the three stories, Debbie Macomber's ""Thanksgiving Prayer"". While Macomber now writes general market romance and women's fiction, this story is Christian Fiction but almost seems like general market romance with a heavy overlay of Christianity. For all the God talk in the story, faith doesn't seem to play a major part in the character's lives. It is like it is there just to make it meet some checklist of things to include in a Christian novel. The other two stories are mildly Christian--they mention churchgoing and prayer, but they are clearly love stories and not stories about faith."
1,"So bad, the filmmakers diss it on the commentary track!!","This movie is bad, and I mean BAD! It's so bad that when you listen to the commentary track on the DVD, you find out that even the writer, director, producer, etc think it's horrible. They tell a few things about the movie and how they made it, but most of it is talking about how the movie is horrible, utter garbage. They talk about how no one is probably hearing what they're saying, because they already shut it off, took it back to the rental store, and threw it in the employee's face. The movie itself seems like a waste of time. Why did they make it, when it seems they only put 1% of effort into it? They even talk like the movie was so under- budget it couldn't be made right. Stay away from this movie, no matter what you do. If you see Full Moon or Tempe Video on any movies, it's probably a good idea to stay away from all of them....I have yet to see these two groups release anything even close to watchable."
5,"Low Budget, Big Idea","A must see for the serious aspiring filmmaker. Interesting low budget effects, great acting, and a lofty idea made interesting despite budgetary constraints. Also contains interesting additional material."
2,"An OK Film, but rent it if your bored!!!!","I first seen this movie at a local video store. I thought the movie was bad. The little robot bug looks just like an electricwind-up toy. The other special effects were kinda good.The picture looks like either [an explict] video or a bad B-movie!If you rent or buy this movie, do it cause you're bored out of your mind! Don't waste your money on it!"
3,Fair Full Moon Release,"I always look for the fun in Full Moon releases, but Horrorvision was all serious. In fact, I think this is the first Full Moon release I've seen that took a serious stride. HorrorVision tells the story of Sed, a technology freak who is losing friends to a mysterious website. After he loses his girlfriend, it looks like all hope is lost from this guy. After being attacked by a techno-pede (my word for the creature that resembled a centipede but was all metal), he runs into a mysterious man who helps him on his quest to discover the truth behind HorrorVision.com. I believe if they worked on this a bit more, and made the gore a bit more believable, it would've worked well if it had been widely released. The acting was real good for Full Moon, and the directing was quiet good also. Although there were things not needed in the movie, I think it was a pretty fair release from Full Moon. The ending left it open for a sequel, which I hope will be a tad better if there is one."
1,Horrorvision DVD,"I just got this movie because of the reviews from Amazon and boy what a waste. This is a VERY low-budget piece of crap. Very boring story and I've seen better acting in a high school play. The main characters are named Dez & Dazzy. That should have tipped me off right there. On the back cover it reads ""Dazzy his BEAUTIFUL girlfriend."" Well, her ugly face was the biggest HORRORVISION in the whole movie. Who did the casting for this movie?? STEVIE WONDER! Well, whoever they should find a new profession. For the people who liked this movie, watch Halloween you will be thrilled. LESSON - if it couldn't EVEN make it in the theater, THERE IS A REASON!"
1,wish it had more..............,"detailed true story of Enzo, and the making of Ferrari in each model. This book is good for beginners who just want to woo and ahhh Ferrari by flipping pages, but not for an expert like myself. I would recommend the DVD, the movie about Enzo's life and his factory. This books also pricey. NASCAR FAN~!!! GO HOME DEPOT~!!"
2,Awesome Official Account of Racing History,"This is the true story - from Enzo's days as an Alfa Romeo engineer and race mechanic, up to his death...and beyond. It's refreshing to find the story so well summed up - while it's not an unbiased account, it's exactly what you'd expect from the folks who make some of the most amazing machines on the face of this earth. What an awesome story, and great pictures to boot!"
4,The Racing Bible.,"If you are interested in a broad sweep of Ferrari racing history, this is the book. If you are interested in Ferrari road cars, buy ""Ferrari"" by Hartmut Lehbrink instead. This is an excellent book, large and heavy with great color pictures and cut-aways. It does gloss over the road cars and has great summary color thumbnails of all Ferrari's (racing and road)in the back. A worthy addition to any Ferrari library."
1,horrible product,"I bought this battery after careful consideration. Now I'm shopping for a new ipod. This battery is a bit thicker than the original battery. When I slid the ipod's motherboard back into the case, the additional pressure cracked the screen. Horribly. I've taken apart and rebuilt many computers, so I'm used to doing this kind of work. I was going to throw the ipod away before this fiasco and now it looks like that's my only choice. I'd stay away from this product and look at one of the other replacement batteries out there."
5,THE MOVIE WAS A GREAT BLAST FROM THE PAST,"I REALY ENJOYED SEEING THIS SHOW AGAIN. i HAD BEEN SERCHING FOR IT FOR YEARS. I ALSO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO THE COSTUME DEIGNER IS. IF ANY ONE HAS ANY LEADS ON THOM CHRISTOPHER'S COSTUME,PLEASE LET ME IN."
3,cooling power medicore at best,"I recently bought this product and have only used it for an ice pack so far, so this review is really only for that half of it's use.I am not satisfied with it, it does not hold the cold long enough, remaining cool for less than an hour. In fact it does not ever become ""cold as ice"" in my opinion. If you need it for anything other than very slight injuries or use, fine buy it, but if you have a reoccurring problem as I do, tennis elbow, don't bother, an old-fashioned ice pack will be far more effective.And yes, I left it in the freezer for 24 hours before use. Doesn't matter. Ineffective."
4,This is great,"This feels awesome. I love the heat from the microwave. I did buy this too small, so it takes a lot of work to pull up to my elbow. I like it better than my homemade beans hot pack."
3,PRODUCT INCLUDES WARNING ABOUT LEAD,"This is a stunning lamp, and I was entirely pleased with it. It arrived in flawless condition. The shade is beautiful and has a wonderful texture. The base has a nightlight. It looks beautiful in my living room, and matches my mission end table completely. HOWEVER, the manufacturer has included a warning to inform the customer this lamp contains lead, which has been know to cause cancer and birth defects. After on-line research regarding lead toxicity, I am fairly confident in this product's safety, and I intend to purchase another one to add symmetry and balance to my living room."
5,Two classics!,Two fantastic films with compelling stories and amazing acting. Hoffman deserved every award he got. Robert Blake was perfect as a killer - you feel sympathetic until you realize what a terrible crime he committed.
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Far from being original cast recordings, these are not even reasonable facsimiles. Many of the voices and orchestrations are distinctly amateur in quality. ""Till There Was You"" from the Music Man is done to some kind of a cheesy Rhumba-style orchestration that bears no resemblance to the original. For the first time in my life, I actually threw away a CD after one listening. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Georgia on My Mind!,"Because they didn't put in ""Georgia on My Mind"" in the last series DVD, I've no only lost my faith in Universal, but in humanity in general...I'm going to wander into the desert now and search for a community where soundtracks to television shows still matter. I'll send word if I find anything!"
3,A MASTERPIECE,I LOVE THE SHOW. YOU ALWAYS WONDER WERE HE WOULD END UP NEXT. BUT WHAT WAS HE TRYING TO DO OR WHAT WAS HIS MOTIVE FROM GOING FROM PLACE TO PLACE. NEVER SEEN ALL EPISODES. NOW THE REASON WHY I GAVE IT 3 STARS. THE ORIGINAL MUSIC HAS BEEN DELETED FOR GENERIC MUSIC IN EVERY EPISODE. MAKING BUYERS BACK OFF. IF NOTHING IS ORIGINAL. THAN I WONT BUY. EVEN THOUGH I LOVE THIS SHOW. IT SPOILS THE MOOD.
4,Remembrance,"i remember watching this show growing up with my siblings, usually after finishing with homework from school. we always sat together and enjoyed the quirky jokes, and cleverly insinuated satires. i now enjoy watching them with my dad in observance and unerring attentiveness of it's comical audaciousness in misconstruing the ideas and ideals it represents. i will be amusingly bemused if i do not purchase the box sets of the remainined two seasons by the end of the year. that is all i really have to say on the matter."
3,If nothing more to watch...,The US history moments have been revisited and comprehended from a viewpoint of a time travelling old looking something-like-teen observer.Creators' talent extending this fairytale endlessly amuses a reviewer.
1,NOT the original version of the show - music edited,"If you are one of those idiots who says ""oh shut up and stop complaining, it's just the music, waaa waaa"", take your DVDs and BURN them. You know nothing about what it means for the music to be an important part of the show and are just a complete moron (I can't express in words the anger that goes through me reading someone go ""it's just the music""; it's NOT just the music!!!, it's the SHOW that is screwed up!!!)Quantum Leap is one of those shows where the music is crucial aspect of show; the music is not just some background noise; it sets the mood. The show is completely ruined and is not worth a cent without the original soundtrack. Awful job on the part of Universal."
1,Horrible Conversion!!!,"I love this show. That said... the creators of this masterpiece should have the right to shoot whoever made these DVD prints. When the DVDs do actually play, they look like I made a copy with a pudding covered VHS tape. On some episodes I can almost see through Sam if he has on black. The black levels are horrible. The coloring is just plain off. Colorized versions of old Gilligan's Island look better than this. Also, I thought I could get past the music part, but OMG it just sucks. Next time let me record some Casio songs and throw them in there... it'd be better! The music was such a part of the show.. I feel ripped off in every way buying this. Seasons 3-5. Season one played fines and had the music."
1,Not Director's Vision Without Music,"I like the show. However, without the music, it is second rate. Quantum Leap relied on the music to give us a sense of nostalgia for the eras Sam was transiting. Music was also an integral part of the director's vision for the storylines.It is criminal to market DVDs without original music as a ""complete"" season. They are not complete. I will no longer purchase DVDs before their release dates until I can verify what I'm purchasing is the director's original vision for the product."
4,Still Alot of Fun,"I enjoyed this show growing up, and it's been really great getting these first three seasons on DVD. Season three has what may be the most touching show of the entire series with ""The Leap Home - Part One"" when Sam leaps into himself at the age of 16. And while season three really introduces a more ""politically-correct-social-message"" element to the show (specifically the heavy handed Watts Riot episode), most of the shows still hold up well a decade plus later. ALSO for Friday the 13th fans...in one leap Sam lands in a magician who is struggling to keep his daughter in a custody battle, and his wife is played by Amy Steele from ""Friday the 13th part 2"" and her lawyer/boyfriend is played by Erich Anderson from ""Friday the 14th IV"", which I thought was kind of cool. I wish there were more shows like Quantum Leap still around instead of today's TV offerings and having to watch someone eat armadillo anus for cash."
1,Forget It,"Music replacement abound, once again. A truly great show is being given the shaft by Universal, who perceives its formidable fan base as an open wallet. Boycott -- don't listen to the soulless collectors who only want to line their DVD shelves. QL without the original music arrangements is a travesty."
3,Okay,"Some of the more earlier seasons were much better and tended to hold ones interests , unlike later seasons did"
4,An Angel of God,"When it was on TV once a week, I enjoyed the program. Now that I can watch episode after episode, it finally occurred to me that the theme is a lot like another favorite: ""Touched by an Angel."" The results are similar in Quantum Leap, except that Sam Beckett takes over the lives of individuals to correct what would have gone wrong had the original person been confronted with difficult times."
4,Astonishing!,I had watched a few episodes of this serial. Now I'm watching them all and I'm very happy for my purchase. So I soon will know how Dr. Beckett's story ends.
1,R2 UN-EDITED!!!!!!!,The US version is cut. I ordered the UK Region 2 version and it is NOT CUT!!! All music content is correct!!!! Most DVD players now play any region DVDs. If you dont have a region free player just Decrypt and burn them without a region and that works to.
1,"No original music, No sale","Some have wrote, the music doesn't matter, I disagree, and have wrote Universal about it, if they change the music again, I will not buy it, I even resold the second season on eBay. I have every episode on video, all the original NBC telecast, therefore uncut, with the original music, which is a lot better, than the crap, Universal is trying to pawn off on us!"
3,Bring back the original music!,"If the producers don't bring in the original music for this DVD set, I'm stopping right at the first two seasons. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with the season two DVD set because ""Georgia on my Mind"" is absolutely CRITICAL to the flow of that story and the music they replaced it with was terrible!!!!!They have a lot of nerve pulling this crap on us. They are doing the same stuff with the NORTHERN EXPOSURE dvd's, and it is just a cheap way of shaving money off of their production costs because nobody wants to spend money to reacquire the rights to the music of these fine shows.If they don't have the original program AS IT WAS AIRED, they should not call it the ""COMPLETE"" season of Quantum Leap. Just grab it off of morpheus, Grokster, or Kazaa. Go to Bit Torrent, and download away! =)"
1,got ripped off for $17.oo,"ordered the ez mounting bracket recommended by the site, it was the wrong one .they refuse to replace with the correct mounting kit. so beware of the freq bought together items. they charged me $17.00 for return shippiing when it was the wrong item."
5,Great!!!!,"These Picks are great. I have been using them in my Martini's and Bloody Mary's.Nice and sharp. The ends are big enough to hold easily and to stop olive's or whatever you are using on them so they dont slide off.Feel very solid, they are nice and heavy (well heavy for a pick)I just wash mine by hand. They would probably be fine in the dish washer, but I dont want them to slip through any of the trays.I would highly recommend them to anyone."
4,Does the job,"Nothing stylish or exciting about this garment bag, but it does the job. It is well built and the material looks like it will last a long time. The clamping system for the hanger hooks coming through the top is a little clunky. A simple slot to pull the hooks through probably would have worked better. But, overall, definitely worth the price. It is an inexpensive solution."
5,Wally suit bag,This was better than I expected. It was delivered promptly and the quality is excellent. Great for roadtrips in the car or airport.
5,By far the best Garment Bag ever made!,"I have owned mine for 20 years and never check my luggage. This bag has been in the overhead bins of planes going to N. America, S. America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and counties cities. I've logged hundreds of thousands of miles with Wally,, during which time I have consistently abused it in every way possible. Obviously do not ever consider a different Garment Bag!"
4,Great Garment Bag,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. It's easy to carry, and lightweight. Seems sturdy. He’s getting a lot of use out of it."
5,just right,"I travel often but rarely need to bring a jacket and dress shirt. This product is perfect for those occassions. It's durable folds in half for transport and keeps everything in place. It's not fond of thicker hangers due to the ""wally lock"" but that is easily overcome with standard ones."
3,Enjoyable - but not very educational,"My daughter received this game when she was 2 and she has enjoyed it. She enjoys the characters and the games, but it doesn't hold her attention very long. Also, there is very minimal educational value to the majority of the games available. Okay for younger kids (2-3) but over 3 or 4 years old seem to loose interest even though it is rated for ages 3 to 5."
3,Not Compatible with 64 bit Vista,"This looks like a great preschool game, but be aware that it is not compatible with 64 bit Vista (Vista x64). I tried to load on my new computer for our 3 year old and it would not run. Searched the internet and found a page on microsoft's website listing this as a program that is incompatible with Vista x64."
3,Just okay,"The journal looks nice, but the pages slip out of the cover easily. It would be good if not for that."
5,Great Belt Made In USA!!!!,Dayco belts have always served me well and are made right here in the USA!What more can you ask for?A quality product at a great priceBy Dayco keep jobs in the USAYou wont be disappointed!
1,From Back Cover,"""Mary me and have my baby.""....Cameron Black: He never dreamed he'd speak those words, but he'd been given an ultimatum - produce an heir in thirty days or lose Teddy's Toys, Inc., forever. He knew he could count on Michaela Larkin to treat it like a business proposition. She'd understand....Michaela Larkin: She would never marry in name only, especially not the man she's always secretly loved. But it was tempting just to spend one night of of passion in Cameron's arms. Where was the harm? It wasn't as if she could ever hope to bear his child.... Or could she?"
4,Unusual insights into day to day war.,"Gives out of the ordinary view of things from perspective of engineer. No heroic battle scenes, but the 'real' stuff of daily suffering that is universal to soldering, no matter what war or time. Drawings add to the first person narrative. If you have a Civil War buff on your gift list, add this to your shopping list - it's an undiscovered treasure!"
5,Dangerous Reading,"This, to me is a very good book. The reason I'm calling it dangerous is that while reading it I went out & bought some of the CDs & have since bought another book (the one by Paul TingenMiles Beyond : Electric Explorations of Miles Davis, 1967-1991). I had several live CDs fron this era but hadn't really got into the studio ones until I started reading this book. I must say that I'm quite glad that I did. This helped finally catch up with what Miles was doing. If you have any interest at all in Miles I can't recommend this book enough. It has lots of facts, stories (that sometimes don't agree from person to person) and a very good recording breakdown of the CDs covered. The only thing that I would have liked to see included is more on the many ""bootleg"" CD that can be found. I don't think anyone picking this up will be sorry that they did."
5,Biography of Miles Davis,"I bought this book as a birthday present for my son who is a muscian. It's heavily footnoted, has some great photographs interesting cameos of other jazz musicians, and the scene in the clubs at that time, I scanned the book before wrapping it and giving it to my son. He and I both are huge Miles Davis fans. We saw him in person probably 15 years ago in Boston. He was spectacular and I would love it if he came to Baltimore. I cannot write an indepth review since I only scanned the book and looked at the pictures, but I was very impressed with what I did read and I'm looking forward to hearing what my son has to say about it. I recommend it to anyone who loves jazz.Nancy WilliamsonBaltimore"
4,for kids,"I found this a little to difficult for my seven year old grandson on his own, I worked with him and his telescope to get him on track and he really likes using it. I would recommend it for kids a little older perhaps 10 or more."
5,Absolutely amazing.,"This book is genius. I cannot believe a three year old wrote this. I'm entranced. It's absolutely adorable. Go you, Jake."
5,SMOOTHE,THIS IS THE ONLY LOTION I HAVE USED THAT KEEPS MY SKIN GLISTENING WITHOUT THE EXTRA GREASY RESIDUE! I BUY ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS THIS LOTION AND EVERYONE LOVES IT!
5,A stunning collection of short stories,"The only downside about reading Reasons for Living is that there simply isn't anything else available -in Russian or in English-by this admittedly reluctant author. I stayed up all night to finish these stories, and only wanted more. Highly recommended."
2,Mediocre nostalgia-fest.,"This is not a proper biography or critical overview of Jack Benny's life, but a disorganized collection of anecdotes by one of his former writers. Full of affection, but thoroughly toothless, and a lot of Benny's humor doesn't translate to the printed page -- recaps of favorite bits and gags fall flat. It's not in chronological order (often it's not even clear when some of the events described took place), and it gives very little perspective on Benny's long career. For Benny's life, look elsewhere; for his humor, get one of the many collections of his classic radio series."
4,2 thumbs up,"Great album. Truly one of their best.If you even remotely like The Decemberists than you will love tghis album. ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" & "" Eli The Barrow Boy"" are my favorite songs from this album."
4,A Flair for the Dramatic,"The cover of the Decemberists' new release is the first hint of what to expect: a literate yet melodramatic set of songs, done with an unusual musical blend of British folk-rock and old-style musical theater. Colin Meloy hasn't shaken his penchant for writing songs about doomed and tortured souls. ""We Both Go Down Together,"" for instance, is a rather upbeat tune about two lovers' suicide. And then there's ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"", a sea-shanty epic that reminds us in a colorful way how revenge is a dish best served cold. No one has really done music like this since Steeleye Span, and The Decemberists have definitely created a unique sound in carrying on this kind of musical tradition. They're obviously not for everyone, but anyone who enjoys rich, dramatic storytelling in the style of the old English ballads, will enjoy this CD."
4,"Fun, interesting stuff to listen to","The lyrics are fun and interesting, though the Decemberists are likely to stay a small-niche band. Vocals are ""not for everyone."" I've had some people tell me they're ""weird"" and ""annoying,"" though I kind of like 'em.Nothing here quite as tuneful as ""Chimbley Sweep"" from the earlier CD, ""Her Majesty, the Decemberists."" But overall, I think the new record is a pretty good tuneful romp."
4,Wonderful.,"I was a bit worried about this group. I really love their first LP, Cutouts and Castaways, but the follow up album, Her Majesty seemed like a bit of a dissappointment, although it definitely had its moments. It seems that they hit their sophomore slump awfully hard, and it hurt to see such a promisng group take such a lousy turn, but I digress. With Picaresque, they seem to have recovered their initial footing surprisingly well. The opening track, ""The Infanta,"" is a catchy and upbeat folky number that sounds more like their old material. ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" is probably one of the best and most epic tunes they have ever written, and ""Sixteen Military Wives"" even contains a bit of ""subtle"" political commentary that seems to work well for the group. Overall, I give it 4/5 Stars."
4,A Wonder,"Though perhaps not quite at the level of CRANE WIFE, the unique sound and intriguing lyrics of The Decemberists do not disappoint."
4,Excellent songwriting and musical implementation,"I've been teetering on the edge of really liking the Decemberists for about a year now, and I think ""Picaresque"" has finally pushed me over. There is simply not a lot out there like the Decemberists. Not only do they implent underappreciated instruments such as accordians and violins, but they do it in a way that is consistent with their Celtic roots (and pulls people in who have a marginal interest in Celtic music, i.e. me).The lyrics are nothing to scoff at either, with beautifully written songs such as ""We both Go Down Together"", ""Of Angles and Angles"", and ""The Engine Driver"" springing to mind. The only complaint is their insistence on putting very detailed Chaucer-esque epics here and there (See the Mariner's Revenge Song). I know this is sort of their schtick, but perhaps they should make an entire album devoted to that kind of thing instead of sprinkling in an otherwise even album. I'll definitely be checking out their older albums."
5,Of course sea-shanties can be brilliant!,"With ""Picaresque"", Meloy and the Decemberists manage to do what so few bands seem to be able to skillfully accomplish: they've made an album with tunes more likely to gain them the commercial success they deserve without changing their identity and alienating their current fans. Though a bit more upbeat than their previous efforts and chock full of catchy riffs you can hum along with after only a few listens, the lyrics on the album still maintain the theatrical (and quite somber at times) feel of ""Castaways"" and ""Her Majesty"". Hopefully this amazing album will get more and more people to sit up and listen, and those of us that have been listening all along can be smug and confident in our ""I told you so's""."
5,Best album of 2005,"I have been a die-hard, hardcore Decemberists fan since one day in 2003 when on a whim I checked out ""Her Majesty..."" from my local library and loved it. Then I got ""Castaways & Cutouts"" and was blown away. For the past 2 years I have been listening to both albums at least once or twice every couple of weeks. I can safely say now that Picaresque is the best effort so far from this band. Sporting Life is my favorite song from them ever, and the lyrics are magnificent, smart, fun. Colin Meloy has a true gift for hooky melodies and catchy pop tunes that swirl in and out of places you never expect and constantly keep the listener on his toes. This is easily (along with The Mars Volta's ""Francis the Mute"") the best album of 2005. Thank you Colin."
3,Funny how their worst album gets the most attention to date.,"Picaresque is, in my humble opinion, the least compelling of the 3 long play Decemberists albums so far. The songwriting had never felt gimmicky to me until this album and there's an uneven-ness to it that fragments the arrangement of the album. I don't find myself coming back to this one like I did the previous 2."
2,Good pr?,"I bought this album after reading rave reviews.There are some moments on the album, but a lot of the music is so contrived and I feel like I have heard all the stuff before.I listen to the album and can't get the thought out of my head that the record stores are full of this type of stuff.A cool name is a good start."
2,Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before...,"Hmmm...the kids sure love this. Third time's a charm, huh? Pretty simialr to the first two.Really, this sounds like Jethro Tull's, ""Songs From the Wood,"" which is to say, like ""Aqualung"" without the rockin', heavy bits. That's no good!After recently cranking the ass-ripping, scrumtrulescent wonder-phantasy that is ""Bittersweet"" from Roxy Music's, ""Country Life,"" it's an absolute wonder to me that Bertolt Brecht-esque vaudvillian showtunes and sea shantys are such the rage and so ""new-fangled"" with all the younguns...Good but just extremely overrated..."
2,Blander than pinochle with your grandma,"This band is very bland (as the title of this review suggests). Lifeless would be another word you could use without fear of misrepresentation. I will agree that they have improved greatly since Castaways and Cutouts; they seem to have found more of a style for themselves. However, they unfortunately do not grab my attention. Some bands have bridges/parts that might sound like filler, the Decemberists have nearly 11 tracks of it. Also, I can't get over how much the singer sounds like a watered-down Jeff Mangum (Neutral Milk Hotel), intentionally or not, it's somewhat annoying."
3,he'd send the army in,"Ever wonder how the top-ranked reviewers force their way to the top?They vote for their own reviews over and over.So brilliant. So clever. But not ""well-done""! Certainly not the mark of a professional.Talk about the triumph of noise over signal, chaos over order, and quantity over quality!"
1,Poseurs Sans Talent,"Can't sing, can't play, can't even get ""Decembrists"" reference right. This crap is anti-music for inverted snobs. It isn't half as smart as it thinks it is."
5,New sound and brilliant....,This is my first Decemberists album. I bought it because of the recommendation. I am thoroughly blown away by the sincerity and raw emotion in these lyrics. But the great part is that the voices and harmony mix together to make a perfect sound. I am in awe of this band.
5,A king among runaways.,"I was one of the many fortunate fans who managed to get a hold of the album before its release, just in time to see their show in Seattle this past March. The show was mind-blowing, and the new album is their best work yet. I'm buying to make sure they get their dues.Every song, from the whimsical 'Sporting Life' to the more somber 'Eli, The Barrowboy' is a work of pure songwriting genius. The music will keep you inspired, happy, and comforted. Lyrical genius is hard to come by in a world of cookie-cutter indie bands, but The Decemberists have managed to stay far ahead of the rest of the mediocrity by not settling for anything less than perfection.'Picaresque' is their best work yet, and is sure to be the one to rocket them to stardom. The world needs more musical groups such at these six amazing artists with a penchant for romantic storytelling and old world vibes.Beautiful. I can't stop listening and haven't for two weeks."
2,"Not nearly as good as the original, real paper, filters","These filters, are not like the original. I got a package of filters with my Acme juicerator, and thought I was ordering the same thing when I ordered these ""paper"" filter replacements. The original lapped a little when installed, enough to completely cover the inside of the blade basket, and keep the pulp from sticking in the basket. These are 3/4"" shorter, and barely meet, so there may still be some pulp that gets on the basket, and is a pain when it comes to cleanup. The other thing is these are NOT paper, like the old ones were. I put a match to one, just to prove it, and it did not burn like paper, but melted like plastic. Poor design, and poor quality.... and not an acceptable replacement for the original REAL paper filters. Disappointed here, but stuck with no other options for filters that I can find."
5,Don't juice without them!,"These liners dramatically shorten cleanup time after juicing. They act much like a coffee filter, so ground pulp doesn't get trapped in the metal mesh of the juicer."
1,General comment regarding lack of product information,"I would likely spend a lot more at Amazon if someone would take a brief moment to put some basic information on the page. Using space to say it's attractive is a waste of time; I have eyes. Better to tell me how much coffee the canister holds. If I'm shopping for glassware, I want to know how much liquid the glass holds. Meanwhile, I leave Amazon and search elsewhere online where I get a better description of what they're selling and that's where I make my purchase."
2,Cheap Chopsticks,i bought this item for a gift and was disappointed when the chopsticks were painted silver. The paint chipped almost as soon as they were removed from the box.
1,not stainless steel,"These chopsticks are not stainless steel, they are plastic. I can press into them with a finger nail and leave a mark. I dont know of any stainless steel that you could do that to, what a rip off."
1,WARNING: PRODUCT MISREPRESENTATION,"These chopsticks are NOT STAINLESS STEEL; they are NOT EVEN METAL.I can hardly blame the folks at Amazon for not realizing this initially: the product comes in a box with ceramic sauce bowls and chopstick rests that contribute significantly to the overall weight of the box. One wouldn't be able to easily distinguish silver-painted chopsticks from actual stainless steel chopsticks until the package is opened. Furthermore, I have serious doubts about whether these chopsticks are dishwasher safe.I would have returned them had I not found uses for the bowls and chopstick rests.In hindsight I wouldn't order these again.There are metal chopsticks available on Amazon (I recommend Global Decor Stainless Steel Chopsticks, 4 Pairs). Sadly, even these are not steel, probably aluminum; but the get the job done."
2,Great for the most part,"I got this as a christmas present for my sweetheart because I always forget to ask for chopsticks at the restaurants. I love the fact that it has chopstick holders so I don't have to lay them dirctly on the table, the bowls are really shallow and I'm not much of a sweet and sour sauce or soy sauce guy which is all i would see they would be good for. The chopsticks unfortunately are too smooth to hold any of the food in place, I may not have the most finesse but when i'm working with wood chopsticks I do just fine but smooth steel not so much. I've heard of people taking knives to them and creating etches or sanding them somewhat to make them rougher but I'm not the type of person that buys something so I can do more work to it to make it work for me."
5,All Brave Sailors,"All Brave Sailors by J. Revell Carr is the amazing story of the sinking of the British freighter Anglo-Saxon by a German raider, and the seventy day voyage of the ship's seven survivors in a small boat. Carr also tells the story of the German raider, its captain and crew. Although the entire book is extremely well written and very interesting, it is the time spent in the small jolly boat that really captures the reader's attention and imagination. How the two sole survivors were able to hold on, how they found land is a remarkable tale. This book also very ably highlights the contributions made by the men of the Merchant Marines during World War II. These men were every bit of the heroes that the men who actually fought in combat were and it is about time a book singing their praises was written. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII."
1,Not So Ophelia,"I'm a fan of the original work (you know, Hamlet), as well as a consistent reader of any sort of updated fairy tale young adult novels (despite my growing age), but I was bored within the first three pages of this one and stopped reading after I hit around page twenty. For the first time in years I skipped ahead to the ending and was glad that I did so, to spare me the trouble of reading the middle. I won't ruin any of the few details, but in the author's blurb it claims that she was never satisfied with the original handling of female characters like Ophelia. Having written several term papers on various Shakesperian plays, I feel confident when I say that re-imagining the life of Ophelia, a character as fascinating as she is complex and tragic, is really unnecessary. Instead, stick with Roselind, Romeo's Ex, a book that works with the original story instead of against it."
3,A Mixed Review,"On the good side, the book draws young readers in and should prove to be a good source for comparison with the original. Ophelia's character is anything but objectified as it is in the original. Fiedler's character has spirit and intelligence that may be inspiring to young girls reading the book.However, there are some drawbacks to this book. 1) Everything seems to go right. The happy ending is a little too contrived and might dissapoint those true Shakespeare fans out there. 2) If the book is for young readers who identify with the teenage Ophelia, is it really a good idea to have Ophelia and Hamlet consumate their relationship? I'm not sure how to see this. 3) The author seems to take great joy in her little allusions to the real text, other Shakespeare works, and to modern slang (like ""Just add water""). This can be corny and a little annoying.All in all, this is much better than ""Hamlet II: Ophelia's Revenge"" but not nearly as good as the original. A good read for fun."
1,Not worthy of the association with Hamlet,I read this book for a paper I was writing regarding the use of YA novels in helping students better understand Shakespeare's play Hamlet. This book does a poor job at reflecting the true story. It completely twists Shakespeare's plot and characters in an undesirable way. Fiedler completely removes the tradgedy from the play. This story has no value and fails to address the key themes and dillemas that the original has to offer. Michelle Ray's Falling for Hamlet is a much better choice and is executed beautifully. I would recommend reading that version over this one.
2,Disappointing,"Dating Hamlet is good for anyone who does not like Shakespear. The original Hamlet is an ingenious tragedy, and Fiedler makes a joke out of it. All seriousness is lost by this false Ophelia play-acting everything. Fiedler's dialect is really bad, and it distracts from the plot of the story. I gave this book two stars instead of one because I couldn't seem to put it down. I did not like some of the things Fielder added (such as Polonius not being Ophelia's father, which wasn't in the orignal Hamlet.) If you want to read a great fantasy book with a strong female role, this isn't it. If you like Shakespear, don't read this book. But if you like characters who seem a little egotistical and fakey, this is the book for you."
4,More than Marching,"This tape is great to get you started on workouts. If you are not very physically fit, or, as I hate to admit, I do quite often, and let myself go for a month or 2, this one kick starts me, and eases me back to a regular aerobic routine.Smith's workout is easy to follow, and there are modifications to make it more challenging. She doesn't stop at a marching rhythm, but moves on to some latin moves and hip-hop.If you are a workout junky, and are already in tip-top shape, this will bore you, and after a week or two, I have to move on to more challenging videos. It is great for beginners, or when you just want an easier workout than your usual fare."
5,My favorite low impact aerobics video.,"Kathy smith is great. She has two additional instructors working with her in the background showing more advanced moves than the ones she does. It's a great exercise video for beginner exercisers or for people like myself who want to work on their cardio and the other fitness instructors are too challenging. The music and the moves are fun, but remember, this is a work out video, so it will be cheezy at times. Still, she's one of my favorite instructors and I love this tape. It's your half hour cardio workout all in one tape."
1,Faulty product,"It worked fine for 2 weeks but now the thing will not quit cutting the power, it is not my wiring since I have another of the power sentry units and it works fine but the one that works is not the one with the coax.I have emailed CCV sales about the problem but have not heard from them yet. I will update when I do hear from them."
2,"watch Marianne, then leave quietly","How did the director of ""the Vanishing"" manage to churn out this nasty little exploitation horror masquerading as Art ? Watch the bits with the glorious Marianne Faithfull singing, then have a little mental debate with yourself as to whether she knew what she was getting involved with, then quietly leave the movie - don't you know it's OK to walk out on a video this reprehensible ?"
3,"needs a revision, faxed 3 companies but wrong #'s",I tried to fax 3 companies to send out resumes but none of them were good. The book would be a valuable asset for pilots if they would make a revision every year.
3,Thermal pad,"Using this pad does enable one to concentrate the heat or the cold in a specific area and secure it there to. However, I have found that the heat only last about fifteen minutes and not the 30 minutes that the instructions say it will, but it does work fine while the heat or the cold last."
5,Love it.,My neck had been tense for a few weeks. I wore this (longer than the recommended time) and it melted the pain away.
4,Easy to use,Does a great job of releaving muscle aches and pains. Heat last abt 10 -15 minutes after microwaving. Very good for neck and back pain. I recromend this for sore backs and all aches and pains.
5,The thermalon microwave activated moist heat-cold compress wrap for back,"I use this for my eyes, face and also for my neck. It holds the heat well and does a good job. I recommend it."
2,Not cold,The shape and weight of this product pleased me. However it does not get that cold. If it meant primarily for heat I wont know since I don't own a microwave. I had hoped to replace my clunky ice packs for my ice sessions but this has fallen to the bottom of my freezer already.
5,Heating Pad - Warm in Microwave,"I originally purchased this Thermalon Microwave Activated pad for a sore shoulder. It tied easily to my shoulder and stayed in place even when I was walking around. (This was so convenient after trying to use an old-style heating pad that plugged in and kept me tied to the sofa.) Now that my shoulder is feeling better, my husband is using this wonderful product daily for a stiff neck, and is so happy that I purchased it. I may never get it back from him!!This heating pad has very long ties that can be secured to your body in so many different ways. It retains the heat for around 15 minutes after being warmed in the microwave for around a minute. It is a fantastic product that we highly recommend."
2,good idea poorly executed,"As a cold wrap it just doesn't get cold enough and the tie is not secure enough, a velcro fasten would have been much better."
1,Not as depicted,"Im so tired of reading reviews and descriptions, then buying things because of them. Once again I fell for the good reviews and pictures too. This neck wrap is awkward , cheap and very very heavy for someone with sore muscles. I feel it is misrepresented entirely. There is no cover for it, it's very thin material so you feel the beads inside, and it will snag easily too...just not as described or pictured, so please beware. I thought from the way it looks on the site that it would be soft, lightweight, and comfortable; more so than the other Thermalon...it isn't and it is also very small compared to the other neck wraps . One reviewer did mention this; I should have listened . I hope I can get a refund."
1,Waste of Money,Very bad. Looses heat in 5 mins Waste of moneyBAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD
5,A courageous and pioneering work.,"This book does an admirable job of staking out the issues necessary for individuals and society to address in order to begin true healing from the forces that compel people to act out sexually with children. Hastings alludes to her own history in this area and thus models the courageous stance that replaces shame with honesty. I found myself having a wide variety of feelings while reading this book, and found it harder to read than I had anticipated. While not a definitive work on the subject (such a book hasn't been written yet), this work will be seen as instrumental in pointing the way for future growth in the area of pedophilia recovery."
2,Neither clinically not scientifically sound,"Despite being written by a PhD level psychologist, this text is lacks adequate citations to uphold the writer's opinions and has a chatty, overly personal style. The opinions in the text contradict current research on both the cause of and treatment of sexual offending against children. The concept of intergenerational transmission of sexual abuse of children has been discredited for many years."
4,Not for 20L!,"I am rating this product four stars as I did for the 20L/29 product due to the quality of the product. This particular item, however, is not sized for a 20L aquarium. The sparse item description has been brought to the attention of the seller (Ozbo), but they have declined to act upon the suggestion to augment the description with an actual length/width specification. Be aware that this is not for a 20L (30"" x 12"") tank."
5,IT'S MEDICINE,"I love Daigo Stardust because he has such a nice upbeat and offbeat rocker kind of way. But honestly, I gave this cd to a very depressed friend and it has made her happy..many many times. She calls it her rainy day cd. Just buy it already."
1,Be very cautious about using this on a dslr!,I do not recommend using this strap on any valuable photography equipment. The strap looks beefy enough from the photo but there is a reason the seller fades the photo and does not show the bottom part of the strap. Below the black webbing you see the strap has a very small quick release buckle that separates the strap from the portion that attaches to the camera. This buckle is of extremely low quality. A mild tug on the buckle and it will separate without pushing the buttons. I can forecast an unexpected separation and my camera crashing to the floor.The second major design flaw is the thin twine used to attached the bottom portion of the strap to the camera. This twine is very fine and cannot possibly be rated to withstand the weight of a dslr over time.A much better product that I have found is the Op/Tech dslr wrist strap. It is much better made and worth the few dollars more in price.
3,Camera Wrist Strap,"The wrist strap is more for a man than a woman (will not tightly secure to a women's wrist), but it still provides a more secure strap than the flimsy strap that comes with digital cameras today."
2,only good on carpets,"Since we got wood floors, with area rugs, we never use our Roomba anymore. It doesn't handle the uneven surface well. It also gets stuck a lot, and it's just easier to whip out the old vacuum cleaner. The old one picks up the dirt much better, too, and doesn't need to be emptied as often. Wish we hadn't bought the Roomba -- a good idea, but not a great product."
1,DUD for the price,Our Roomba (loving called Scooter) worked really well for about 6 months. So we told everyone how wonderful this little vaccuum was and at least 7 of our family members bought one. Now none of those work. At the most they have lasted a year. For the price we paid for this we expected it to last much longer than it did. The repair costs are too high also. I guess we are going to have to stick to the old fashion vaccum.
1,Life Span,"Great product - for a while. Died of the common (terminal) spinning disease after ~ 2 months work, thats about $150.00/mo. for a vacuum."
5,fantastic product,"This product lives up to every claim the company makes, plus they have a tremendous customer support system. This is the second one I have purchased, as I wore the first one out. It does the work for me while I am doing other things. Great for picking up pet fur and going under beds. dressers, and chairs."
4,Great Product,"I am a clean freak, so this is a great tool for me. It works fine to maintain my already clean apartment. The only complaint I have it the battery seems to discharge very easily if u leave it off the docking station (I want to try and avoid the risk of over charging the battery) as it heats up while on the docking station."
3,Does a great job,I use my roomba to go over where I have already swept. It is amazing how much it picks up after I have already swept an area. I got my pretty cheap on WOOT. I think I paid $139. Not sure I would be as happy if I had paid $249 so that is why I gave it 3 stars.
2,Roomba junkyard!,"It's just like a page out of Sanford and Son; we've got Roomba and Scooba parts all over the place. It's a veritable iRobot junkyard!The hobbyists at iRobot apparently do not have the time or interest to support test and maintenance, they're too busy designing the next generation of highly vulnerable little thinking machines to worry about the bugs they've left behind.Maybe a good book on mechanotechnology would help, or maybe it's already too late. I am told that some new 'backers' entered the ball-game when it appeared that iRobot was on the ropes. A little fresh money produced the newest model but that too is falling apart. The people who second source the Roomba batteries are now starting to second source the Roombas themselves.It is a pity, but I suspect that iRobot will soon be no more."
2,"Fair Engineering, Very Poor Manufacturing","This model is sort of smart so kudos to the guys at MIT. However, there are consequences to contracting out the manufacturing process to a cut rate Chinese firm. I'm waiting for my third replacement unit as I write this. The brush motor burned out in my original 4220 in about 9 months and the 4221 replacement only lasted 2.5 months. I'm now out of warranty and figure I have three months of life left in this $300 purchase.Really, selling a plastic toy with no possibility of repair is just criminal. Shame on IRobot...shame."
4,heartland americana poetry,This is a great mix of great songs! This is the newest of Tim Grimm's recordings and everyone of them is worth spending time with. Check out more on www.timgrimm.com and you'll be happy you did.
4,Soft and pretty,"I ordered this for my wedding since we were going to be outside for the reception. It is soft, not at all scratchy like others I have, but I wish the threads were tighter."
5,Excellent Referrence!,"An excellent reference for Dirac and Shrodinger operators in reletive mechanics! The Kerr Geometry represented is excellent, and the solutions given are helpful both for reference and perhaps for further research!"
4,One of the better eBay books,"This book targets people looking to make a full-time living selling on eBay. It is not targeted at buyers or infrequent sellers. The book does a good job of presenting information and it has a number of great tips that will benefit any seller. Infrequent sellers will have to wade through a lot of business strategy text to uncover the most valuable tips. Overall, it was one of the better eBay books I read.After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:---Beginner with eBay and computers---1. The Official eBay Bible---eBay Seller---1. Sell it on eBay2. eBay Hacks---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---1. eBay Strategies2. eBay Business the Smart Way"
3,Nice at first,"This was a bright flashlight when I got it, but after a few months of use the Red-green battery indicators quit working and some how pulls down the output of this flashlight to about half of its normal output of light.Also the idea of using rechargeable AAA was first appealing - but it too has had issues working correctly as the spring connectors became lose - I found my self pulling on the them to get a tighter contact with the battery for better contact.I have a had a good overall experience with Dorcy products and will continue to buy from Dorcy as I believe they give a great bang for the buck, - just in this case it was a great idea that did not seem to pan out for me.Note: I have sense bought a Dorcy flashlight #41-4299 K2 Luxeon 220-Lumens Rechargeable LED Flashlight and LOVE IT, and you may want to check it outAlso note if this flashlight had continued to work Properly I would rank this a FIVE STAR as it was wonderful at first :)amazon is the best :)"
5,Dorcy 6 Watt 3AAA K2 LED Flashlight,"I need to use a flashlight every time I am at work and often while enjoying activities. I am a bit of a flashlight junkie. I own flashlights that cost 10x more than this, but I am surprised to find it the brightest. I have found Dorcy flashlights to be durable, functional, and value priced. This appears to be no exception. The use of 'AAA' batteries is a plus for a flashlight that sees regular use."
2,Bright and Cheap,"This flashlight has unbelievable brightness for its size. Plus it uses cheap AAA batteries. That said, it will not last very long. The plastic internal battery holder is thin and cheap. It breaks easily into many parts and thus the flashlight becomes useless. Many who are having troubles with the switch are actually having trouble with the cheap plastic battery holder inside which has failed. BEWARE."
5,Very bright light,"This is a powerful bright light, with a nice size beam. Good quality construction. No more need for those old 10-LED lights."
2,This light has durability issues,I purchased several of these for myself and friends. The beam is very bright for this price range. There is a problem with the internal batttery housing which seems to be very fragile. 3 out of 4 broke suddenly and unexpectedly.
3,Red/green indicator kills the batteries,"To be more specific, it kills one battery, and always the same one. With a fresh set of batteries, it's amazingly bright. However, if I don't use the flashlight for a few weeks, the next time I turn it on, the battery indicator shows red and the light output is really weak. Inspection of the batteries reveals two are just fine and one is completely dead. Replace the dead one, and we're back in business. A few weeks later, turn it on, same thing. Open, replace the dead battery, and we're back in business again. Lather, rinse, repeat... Now, I leave the battery pack out of the flashlight. When I need to use it, I assemble the whole thing and it's ready for use. For the price, I shouldn't have to go to this much trouble. Dorcy: Get rid of the crappy red/green battery indicator and you'll have a fantastic flashlight."
3,"Not 160 lumens, only 120 lumens","The Amazon ""Product Description"" lists the flashlight as generating 160 lumens of light:""The 160 Lumen aluminum flashlight features a High Powered K2 Luxeon 6 Watt LED Solid State Diode one of the brightest LED lights available today! This tool tough construction flashlight comes complete with 3 AAA Energizer batteries.Features: * 160 Lumens""However this flashlight is only 120 Lumens. This is listed correctly elsewhere in the description.I thought I was buying a 160 Lumen flashlight. Oops."
4,Very Bright for a compact AAA Flashlight,"This little guy is bright. K2 Luxeon LED's are amazing little devices.I also purchased a K2 Luxeon LED upgrade kit for an old mini-mag lite and I have to say that while they're both equally bright the larger reflector on this guy does a better job of focusing the light. Also, it's focus is pre-set. I know that the ability to focus is a supposed selling point for the mini-mag but how often do you actually do anything but focus it to a tight spot? This one is already focused on a tight spot, you just turn it on. I think it's a great flashlight for the money. The threads on the tail cap are a little flimsy, it does seem like it would be easy to cross-thread if you weren't paying attention, also I wouldn't take it scuba diving or anything. But how often are you going to remove that tail cap or expect to go scuba diving with a 20 dollar flashlight?Also this price is competetive, this flashlight was six dollars more at my local hardware store."
3,Luxeon loses again,Loose tolerances on focusing threads.POOR battery efficiency.Cree Q5 emitters are much more efficient- more bang per watt.Suggest Romisen RC-N3 @ $22 delivered (2 AA or 1 CR123).
1,Horrible Flashlight,Go buy the Terralux 3 watt LED for $31. Don't waste your money on this garbage flashlight. the manufacturing of this flashlight is probably the cheapest I've ever bought. it will fall apart on you very quick. Just a big waste of time and disappointment to purchase this flashlight. Take my word for it and go buy the Terralux 3 watt LED here on Amazon.
4,Dorcy 6 Watt LED Flashlight,"Very bright, aluminum housing a little thin. Great light for the price though; Too bad a case is not included with the flashlight."
5,"Great Flashlight, Hard to figure out how to put the batteries in",Its great flashlight. Very bright for its size. Great idea to make it run on AAA batteries. I have had it for several months. Did not have to change the batteries yet. i am very happy with itIt took me while to figure out how to put the batteries in.1- turn open the switch end of the flashlight2- you will see a plate with 3 screws.3- push the plate in then turn the flashlight around.4- the battery container will slide out.5- put the batteries in the container. then slide it back into the flashlightI hope this helps
1,Think before buying this.,"When I bought the Mbox2 it all appeared great while researching, easy recording, free plug ins, you can do this that, many tracks. If you have an average up to date computer like mine you might have much problems with drivers, screen freezes, and lots of unwanted noises and clips. Then the i-lock system chore, everything is a chore with this program, do not expect it to be fun, this item caused me more stress than anything I ever bought, and do not expect any help, or care from the customer service of Digidesign, once you open it you cannot return it to the store either because it's considered opened software. Don;t risk your money on this garbage. It's all hype and sales talk."
1,DO NOT SHIP THIS TO AFGHANISTAN,about a month ago i went through the foolish mistake of purchasing an MBox 2 from amazon which i believed took it from electronica direct. a few years ago a buddy of mine had the mbox1 it was alright it did what it was supposed to do. so i decided to get the mbox 2 shipped out to me in Afghanistan. dumb idea.amazon will take your money even if you don't receive the product. especially when shipping things to Afghanistan.just don't do it
5,Best Toy Ever!,"As an amateur astronomer, I immensely enjoy playing this game on gloomy rainy/cloudy evenings when I can't see the night sky above. Even kids enjoy this game when they're over, because they love the astronomy theme as much as I do. They've learned a lot of astronomy facts and nomenclature while having fun. The new properties and tokens are cool too!"
4,The nature of David Suzuki,"Although some of the articles in this anthology have appeared in Mr.Suzuki's earlier collections, the chance to own a healthy biopsy of all of them shouldn't be passed up. For a geneticist once focused on the chromosomes of fruit flies, his knowledge of the world encompasses a surprisingly large area. He writes of the general myopic vision that is devastating the Earth, while gently stressing the interconnectedness of all things. Any effort to prevent or even mitigate environmental and spiritual disaster should be dutifully read."
2,great game but!!!,i love the game but it dosent work worth a poop on windows u have to play it in doss
2,"Looks good, but is disposable!","Second time I bought this product. Price is good, looks good; BUT IT NEVER STAYS ON DOOR! The wind or just the car movement knocks them off..."
1,"Good Protector, But not for long","I like this product, but it is so low quality - if breaks in halves very fast, and eventually gets loose and fells off your car door. Do not buy this! It's a waste of money, cause you will have to find out a new solution for your problem in a couple weeks anyway. Buy a tape - this will do it much better!"
3,The jury is still out on this backpack,I haven't decided how I feel about this backpack yet. It has a lot of buckles that 9-10 year olds don't want to be bothered with. It does seem to lift some of the weight off the shoulders and back
4,chimbi,hola todo fino Excelenteeeeee muy hola todo fino gustaooo muchoooooo everything right all excellent recommendy poreque esta muy buernono em ha llegadotodo bien lo recomiendobuenoooooooooooooooooooo recomendado
3,An average Japanese romance manga. OK for a quick read.,"There's nothing terribly spectacular about Harlequin's romance manga (Japanese Graphic Novel) Holding on to Alex. The plot is pretty basic; ex-lovers reunite after difficult trials and find true love. The artwork, by Misao Hoshiai, is good but not spectacular. In all, I would rate this as an average romance manga worth the read if you want to pass the. It should be noted that this manga is intended for ages 16 and up as it does contain adult themes."
4,Super Reader,"""If someone asks you if you are a god, you say Yes!""A highly original blast of a story is Ghostbusters, and the novelisation of the same is pretty decent.When a few dodgy parapsychologist researchers stuff up in a university, they start their own business, little expecting they will soon be overalls and proton packs deep in spooks.Very funny."
5,even better than the salad dressing,"I was not sure I would like this book when I picked it up. The idea of a book about starting up a business is unappealing. But it has been delightful to read. I disagree with the person who found it smug. It is light, fun, very tongue in cheek. I have several friends who are planning to read it as well."
5,Shameless Exploitation... review,"I love this book. It is hilarious and fun to read. I picked a copy up in a coffee shop when I was having a rough day and it cheered me up immensely. I recommend it for anyone who has ever eaten a Newman's Own product, or likes Paul Newman for any reason."
4,Not made in England,"The Product Features and Product Description both say Made in England. The Olive Dish that was sent to me says Made in China (on the box and on the sticky tag, but not printed on the dish itself). Still very pretty, and seems like good quality, but I thought I'd post this in case ""Made in England"" is important to other potential buyers. I considered returning it when I saw the tag because I had read in other reviews that the Made in China ones were inferior quality and didn't match well to other Blue Italian sets. But when I opened the package I decided to keep it because it is really lovely and I think it looks just like my mom's other Blue Italian pieces. (We'll see when I can view it right next to the others.)"
2,Quick-pic of life in the golf fast-lane,"Randy Quaid plays a stereotypical golf/athlete who cannot grow up and out of his passion and lack of passion for the game. It is not only the precursor of Tin Cup, but it is a much better movie with certainly more comedy, and gets at the heart of a good walk spoiled. Certainly not a grade ""A"" movie by any standards, but a nice ""B"" look at the behind the scenes life of golf as evinced in Dan Jenkin's novel expose."
3,Dead Solid,"Tape was in good shaped considering how long ago it was made.Movie didn't live up to the hype I'd heard, but it was okay."
4,Sorry to go on about it but......,where is the DVD version of this? I've been waiting for several years in hope of it's release but still no sign. :-(
2,Too dry for my taste,"As a casual history reader, I found this book way too dry. Although it delivers on its premise, namely sketching out a history of Japan, it was a relief to finally put the book down after having read it.This book I bought for the dual purpose of being entertained and learn something in the process, but it could only fulfill the latter requirement. It may be unfair to ask of a book to be engaging and still tell a whole country's history in under 300 pages, so I'm probably unfair - the book just reads too much like a textbook, and that wasn't really what I had hoped for.Not knowing too much about Japanese history from other sources, I can't comment on the accuracy of the text, but there's an annoyingly high frequency of simple spelling errors, etc.Lastly, there's only one map of Japan in the Southeast Asian setting, and it's buried deep inside of the book. I really missed a map of Japan in the book!"
4,Which is worse -- murder or an ISO inspection?,"This was an enjoyable ride with Harley Spring, a supervisor at an integrated circuit factory. (Hence, the chip in the title.) Harley has two problems: murder and an ISO 9000 inspection, and they're both hitting the plant at the same time.I enjoy an insight into worlds I don't know, and this mystery gave me one, as well as several interlocking puzzles. I enjoyed it all. The author produced believable characters, and plausible mysteries, as well as avoiding the common traps of either telegraphing the punches or having the solutions come out of nowhere.I suspect that in future outings, her prose will flow a little better, and her dialogue will have a bit more snap, but neither flaw interfered with my enjoyment of this book.This work will appeal most to those that are technically inclined, and to those who understand and are amused by geeks and nerds. Neither is required, but tech and techies run through the story in modest amounts."
4,I'm a Skelly man,"Wow - best historical novel I've read. I feel like I've lived in 18th Century England. In some historical novels, e.g. Pillars of the Earth, the history is sometimes awkwardly jammed in. Mr. Cline weaves 18th Century London life, naval details, legal issues, etc. so smoothly into his tale that it harmonizes with the story as a whole. I found myself entertained and educated. Bravo!"
5,Great Non-SF Libertarian Adventure,"This book was exactly what I was looking for: a great non-SF libertarian adventure novel. After reading excellent libertarian SF books by Heinlein (""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"") and L. Neil Smith (""Pallas"", ""The Probability Broach""), I wanted to read an historical novel exploring similar ideas. Sparrowhawk proved to be a perfect fit. It is very well written and researched, and extremely enjoyable to read. The story moves along at a very quick pace and I was never bored by it. The main characters are reminiscent of the protagonists in ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"", but at least the author specifically credits Ayn Rand for being an inspiration in his life. If you like historical adventure stories with deep philosophical ideas connecting all of the action together, this is the book for you!"
5,Great Book!,"What impressed me as I first began reading Living in Both Worlds: A Healer and Her Journey with Spirit was how easily the author, Julie Rae Paetow, brought me into the world of Toni Lynn Wood and her Spirit family. Julie's writing style is one which I find easily accessible; she crafts words together in a manner which conveys complex subjects and concepts simply.Whether one is new to the world of spiritual discovery or an experienced traveler on a lifetime journey, I feel all readers will gain tremendous insight into the truth of this life as they read the life story of Toni Lynn Wood, watch her first rebel against, and later embrace, her life's work, that of a spiritual healer.Enjoy."
3,Global Mix,"1,000 pictures into 128 pages equals a visual feast, especially when European, American and Australian trucking is encompassed.History buffs will appreciate the chapters dedicated to early makes from both the USA and Europe, from a pictorial perspective at least. The collage of early truck brochure covers is a a nice touch.Tow trucks and off-highway trucks are not left out either, and there are the show truck and race truck chapters to add spice.As befits a pictorial truck book, which does not get proof read by truck experts prior to publication, untruths and errors can be found.A reference or educational book this is not, but the 1,000 photos will hold an enthusiast's interest.A large colorful glossy hardback with interesting and varied pictures, including a number of cab interior shots."
5,Good book,This book was great - my stepson loves Firetrucks and really enjoyed the pictures in this book. Thanks for a great product.
4,An Organized Review for Business Professionals,"I found this book to be an excellent tool to guide the valuation of a small business. I used the techniques discussed with only minor modifications to meet the particular situation and found I had nearly duplicated the brokers results. Unfortunately, the transaction did not to through as the owner was unrealistic in his analysis... and 4 years later is still trying to sell (the broker resigned after my offer was refused).I am buying a new copy, sans my margin notes and dog-ears, to give a friend who is preparing to sell his business."
5,The fun blooms in Flower Power.,"With a total of eight episodes this DVD has plenty of content.The episodes are ""Flower Power"",""Luck o'the Oopsy,Heatwave,Erased,Bubbles,Harmony Unplugged,Belly Blanked,and Good Knight Bedtime. My personal favorite is Harmony Unplugged,Harmony let's her singingtalents go to her head. For Share fans (I'm one)she is featured in ""Flower Power"" and ""Heatwave"". ""Good Knight Bedtime"" will delightyou Bedtime Bear fans. True Heart really shines in ""Harmony Unplugged"".This DVD has something for everyone who is a fan of The AICAL Bears.I even liked the DVD cover,with nice art work of Share and Cheer."
4,"Very good, but probably only for diehards","This is a solid album, consistent from beginning to end. The attention to detail is incredible, and tracks are allowed to play out and really develop; they're more than mere locked grooves. Still, this is a cd that will probably only be appreciated by people who are already familiar with this particular strain of techno. It's very minimal, and full of small gestures, yet executed well and with perfect timing.""Beau mot plage"" is the big-name track here, and is no doubt familiar to many. Yet despite it's landmark status, I can't really hear what all the fuss is about it. It's nice, but not terribly memorable. Still, that's a minor issue; Rest covers a lot of ground, and covers it well, proving that Isolee's reputation as a first-rate producer is no accident."
4,Fascinating rehearsal (and response to previous review),"I just want to respond to Mr. Morrison's (otherwise typically superb and perceptive) review -- he may have had a tv/dvd connection issue when he was watching the rehearsal sequence, because the rehearsal *is* in color and in very fine sound (better, in fact, than the concert performance which follows). This is obviously a DVD for real conductor enthusiasts - Bohm's rehearsal technique, as Mr. Morrison states, is detailed, demanding, and rather cranky, but he gets the desired results and his knowledge of the score is amazingly precise and impressive. For fans of conductor rehearsals, this is an essential purchase, I think."
1,French?,I took French in High School but I can't read this. And I didn't know it was in Frnch. The title seemed like the logical next step in his life. no where did it say it was in french and not English. Big dissapointment.
1,Thanks for the warning.,"Thanks reviewers. I was getting all excited about him having another book out, too. He has so many fans. I sure wish he'd put out another book soon."
2,Nothing lost in translation,"This is definitely a let-down and a product of bad advertising. But the cover is amazing, and I bought it because I speak French. It's actually a little different from ""me talk pretty one day"" -- there are more french inside jokes. If you are bilingual, it's worth the buy. But if you think it's a new David Sedaris book, don't be fooled.FYI, to the reviewer who so hastily tried to make the other reviewers feel bad, ""Je Parler Francais"" means ""I speak French"" not ""I talk pretty one day"" (It is actually gramatically incorrect in french -- should be ""je parle francais"")so maybe you should get your facts straight."
1,Poor Advertising!,I'm glad I'm not the only one who waited excitedly for this book only to discover that it was in French! Why is it even advertised in English?
1,I was going to use it for my ESL class...,"I am incredibly frustrated to have anticipated this book, to have ordered it to be sent to my parents' house in Missouri, and to have had my mother ship it to me in Paris, where I live, only to find that it is a French translation. I should have paid more attention to the publisher, but ... everyone thought it was a new book! Bad advertising, fellas."
4,A Great First Book,"I read this book when I was in middle school some years ago. I often think about it and can't recall to much, other than I really enjoyed it and it got me hooked on reading. I loaned it to a friend 2 years after reading it and have regreted it ever since. Sure would like to get my hands on a copy of it so I can pass it on to my daughter. I recommend the book to young and old!"
5,absolutely wonderful!,"i read this book about when i was in secondary school. a friend loaned it to me and i was totally blown away. my friends and i all agreed that it's the best Sweet Love book ever. it was passed around all over the school and i'm pretty sure most Columban girls(my old school was St. Columba, Miri)had read it. by the time it was returned to the owner, it was quite shabby. all girls who had read it swore they cried buckets. including yours truly. i've been looking for this book high and low over the years but couldn't find a single copy. i would appreciate it if anybody out there have one to sell. i'm willing to pay. wish the publisher could reprint it again. honest."
4,"wonderful ""first love"" story",This book had so many lessons to teach a teen-age girl about what love really is. I wish I were able to get a copy for my daughters to read. It is one of the best books I have ever read.
5,"Doctor, Doctor","Oh Ohmar Sharif, you are so handsome in your youth and my first on screen love. The love story, the scenery, and the music. Who would have known that the composer of the music score is also the father of another great synthesizer composer, Jean-Michael Jarre! Double bonus!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Nothing like it should be.,"I ordered this hookah as a gift. Although it did arrive in a timely manner, it was nothing like what it should be. It was well under 18"" and was cheap spray painted glass. Everything feels cheap and it for sure did not look like the image."
1,More Than Misleading,"This hookah wasn't remotely close to what I ordered, looked nothing like the picture. The picture shows a BLACK hookah with white design, black bowl, and nicely decorated stem. The one I received, however, was an ugly, cheap-looking green one with an off-green bowl and cheap metal stem. Very disappointed that I waited a week and a half for THIS. Returning immediately and buying elsewhere."
5,Intellectual Russia?,"While maintaining an underlying satirical tone, the author manages an engaging story about the challenges of intellectual and physical burnout. The international flavor lends a modern day touch and a unique way to view the tales of family and romance that weave into the mystery and suspense. By combining harshly real descriptions of the environmental settings with refreshingly accurate portrayals of real human reactions to those environments, the author invites the reader to empathize with the characters and get completely involved in the story."
4,Interesting at least.,"I very much like the fact that this book isn't trying to state these coincidences are all part of a grander scheme. It lets us pose that question for ourselves.The Spiro-graphic orbits - especially that of Venus / Earth are incredible. I must say though, a few of these coincidences are a stretch. Adding and subtracting whole numbers from phi allow many of these to occur, and I cannot see how this can be rationalized. Maybe I didn't understand it correctly, or I'm looking to deep into it.This book is simple, and poses no views. In my opinion, look at it as interesting cosmic relations and planetary art - but don't look into it much further."
3,Not about coincidence,"The Wooden Books series is wonderful. This is a beautiful member of the line, but it is about the geometric harmonies of the solar system, not so much about coincidence as such, so I felt a little disappointment.I have been looking for a book on coincidence. This is not it."
5,envy:a theory of social behavior,"this book is remarkable.it helps us to understand and see how many of the problems in the soviet union etc are rooted in envy, though disguised by politicians otherwise."
4,Schoenck concept of pathological envy is an eye opener.,"Our national hero Jose Rizal probably was groping for a concept to describe the cancer affecting Philippine society at that time, 19th century. Helmutt Schoenck just made it for him, 90 years after."
1,Don't buy,The book is very difficult to get into. It is all over the place. I thought it was going to be more informative than it was. Save your money! Don't buy this book!
2,Try something else,"Pros: Longer lasting than water-based, but not as slick.Cons: Too thick so it doesn't flow. It seems to separate so you need to shake it before use or you may get a thin liquid off the top. And worst of all, it gave me a rash/skin irritation so I will be throwing it away."
4,Good one!,I found this quite good. No match for this in the verbal section in the available book market.
2,very disappointing,Not at all what I thought it would be. This is one of those cds that has ONE really good songs.... the rest are obscure and uninteresting. Very sorry I purchased it.
1,I found the CD at home,This is really old.It is a worth to have as a collection.I think kids in this generation will be amazed by this software. You won't see anything old like this.
5,Gorgeous,"This product is gorgeous. I got the purple, my favorite color, to put on a hangar outdoors, next to purple glass wind chimes. It looks beautiful in the breeze and moves constantly. I'm going to order one in a different color also. The packaging was VERY good, and it arrived quickly and perfectly."
4,"Good for what it is, but not what I expected","My only complaint is that this book was not what I thought it was, for which I take most of the responsiblity. I thought it was actually a prayer book, containing prayers. While it does certainly have several of them, it actually appears to be the liturgical book for the Episcopal Church, tying prayers into dates and various rites, rather than by subject matter, for example. My mistake, but as long as you know what you're getting, it's superb."
4,My comentaries of the Odyssey,"I think that the book is good because they show many things like the universal values. The book talks about one person that is kindapped for 20 years and the things that he needs to pass to back home,i think there was a really good history and i like it but i dont like so many things for example the cyclops that monsters with one eye cuz i dont trust in that things so thats is why i dont like it."
3,The Odyssey,"I think that the Odyssey its a book interesting because it talks about a lot of thinks and the universal theme is truth conquires all because is a book that give us an example of love,because nobody can separate a family that love each other.this book show us that not matter who traying to separate afamily that love each other nobody can separate them."
3,It Crapped out..,"I play in a High Energy Rock band. Use this 10"" speaker as a replacement 4 original Hartke Bass amp speaker I blew...so far so good..use it as personal monitor, and send line to board, for outside speakers.After a couple of months, the speaker, fried.Maybe it's my fault, I was using it, as a stage monitor for my bass.We play really loud. a 10 inch Bass speaker probably better for a home use."
3,Dismal efficiency,"This review reflects not so much Eminence's speaker as much my choice of the Basslite CA2010. I was trying it in a 1x15"" and 1x10"" bass cabinet with and Altec 421 bass speaker. It simply cannot keep up with the much more efficient Altec speaker. Seems well made but one of the pair had to be sent back due to a broken leg of the basket. This was in a clean undamaged box and was clearly packed that way at the factory. The broken piece was taped to the bottom of the box! I suspect it was placed in the wrong pile somehow.A replacement speaker was provided immediately! No complaints about the service."
4,From the great Russian actor!,"This book is written by Oleg Strizhenov, one of the greatest Russian actors. He sincerely tells in this book about his life of an actor and about his love. Once you start reading the book, it's hard to stop - so make sure you have plenty of time to go from one page to another..."
1,Horrible mistake,"This site is nothing but a huge disappointment. First it took forever to load. Then it ""unnamed"" the new room and wouldn't let my daughter retype the room's original name. So we submitted a request for customer support, logged in again, and all of her items had disappeared. What a disaster! She is just as devastated as if someone had stolen things from her own bedroom."
2,Not first quality,The stitching on the back was not done well OR this is a second. The back had a large open seam that I had to stitch up. My daughter still likes her pet but NOT as much.
2,Webkinz Yorkie - awful,"I ordered this Webkinz and 4 others for a couple kids. This one came separately from the others and when we opened the package, the fuzz from the fur came flying out. This is like a cheap dollar store toy and the quality of the Webkinz is awful. Every time you touch the thing the fur continues to fall off. It has so little quality in comparison to the other 4 that I almost wonder if it's a fake. Cheaper to throw away than return it for another one. I would not recommend this animal and would not purchase it again."
3,not fluffy,"The hair was very matted and not fluffy or soft at all. It was not pleasing to the touch. However, my 11yr old daughter still likes that it was a webkins."
4,Great gift for little girls,I like the small size because it makes it more portable. Little girls just love cute plush animals and this makes a great gift.
2,Item not as shown in picture,"The Webkinz Yorkie I received does NOT look like the cute one in the picture. Mine has short, straggly, fuzzy hair, and looks kind of cheap. (I have not used the code online, so I can't comment on that aspect of it. This review is only about the appearance.) I was hoping to give it as a Christmas gift, but instead, I plan to return it"
1,webkinz yorkie,"My son wanted this pet because is was the ""webkinz of the month."" I read the reviews which were not good but he insisted on it anyway. As the other reviewers stated the the animal was matted and unattractive and the hair was permenently stuck to eyes"
1,not as shown in the picture,The Webkinz Yorkie Puppy I received is total different from what shown on the picture. Evne though it is still a dog it is not the one displaied on the picture which my kid really like. it is a total waste.
2,This is a MINI webkinz,I bought this for my daughter as a gift who wanted the WebKinz Yorkie - this is the SMALL MINI one (about half the size of regular Webkinz pet) - NOT the full size Webkinz - but no in the description did it say that so she was disappointed. Just so you know what you are paying for. A mini Webkinz does have a code like other products for Webkinz - but is NOT a full size Pet and is not the same as the regular Webkinz pets that are adopted on line to open an account with.I had to go out to several stores in order to find the one she actually wanted - once I compared the Yorkie to other pets out there I wasn't very impressed. It's not that well made and other pets are cuter.
4,webkinz yorkie puppy,This was a gift for my neice in Canada. She loves it and is really into the webkinz. I also got the frog for my son but he hasn't played with it yet as it is a Christmas present. This is my first purchace through Amazon and I am completely impressed with the service. It was probably the fastest delivery time I have ever recieved when shopping on line. I will recomend and use Amazon in the future. Great site!
1,Disappointed,I agree with a previous buyer. The dog I received did not look anything like the one pictured. It was a BIG disappointment. It was not fluffy or soft and much smaller than expected. It looked very cheap. I would not recommend this particular Webkinz.
3,not what I expected,"I got this dog for my daughter and black lab for my son.Black lab in my opinion is such a better buy.It is soft, Yorkie is not pleasant to touch and looses its hair.I would give him 1 star but my daughter loves it anyway."
4,webkinz yorkie,"This webkinz is very cute although kinda small. It has some pink coloring in the top part of the dog, its not all white with a pink bow. good gift."
1,cheap,"i couldn't get my T616 to sit properly in this thing. it would only charge if i pressed on the phone to make the proper connection. i was skeptical the moment i unboxed it and felt this undeniable cheapness about it. it lacked weight and sturdiness and style. whatever, right? well, when it didn't even work i knew my suspicions were founded in some way."
5,Triggerfish Twist,"Serge A. Storms is by far the most hillarious character ever written! Tim Dorsey takes you on the ride of your life through the lives of the most disfunctional people on the planet! I laughed so hard, I cried."
4,Hilarious and imaginative,This is one book that I found absolutely hilarious. Someone with a wild imagination wrote this book. This is one of those books that you can't wait to keep reading. Although a bit of violence and drug infested I found it refreshing actually. Only read this book if you enjoy laughing. I will definitely read more from this author.
4,"Dorsey delivers a fast-paced, whirlwind tour through Florida crime","Dorsey's novel is most easily compared to those of Carl Haissen and Elmore Leonard (and Dave Barry's two full-length novels), but, if possible, it is even zanier and more incredible. It's set in Florida, with all of its quirks and swampland and the rampant crime from half-witted criminals. Dorsey weaves a topsy turvy plot of dozens of threads which all come together in the end, with the bad guys getting their due and the good ones having it all work out.I'm impressed Dorsey was able to present as many characters as are in this novel, keeping them all straight for the reader, and then bringing them all together for a slam dunk ending.I haven't read other Dorsey novels, but I can see the style getting repetitive after a while, so I'll take him in small doses. If you enjoy this book, be sure to check out Dave Barry's Tricky Business, which is a hilarious Florida crime caper from a talented comedic writer."
1,How dare you compare this to Dexter!!,I love Dexter. The world comes to a grinding halt on Sunday nights for that one delicious hour. I have read about half of Triggerfish and have not clue what is going on! I rarely write a review on a book but this one.... I am just not impressed.
2,this one starts to turn me off from tim dorsey,"this is a messy and pointless novel. simply could not finish it.very messy and random, and the plot is kinda boring. well, i've had enough of this serge character and would like turn to hiassen again and never look back."
2,"This is a Prequel, How?","I've yet to understand how this truly qualifies as a prequel to the first published ""Florida Roadkill."" Can someone shed some light on this? I need to see some type of timeline here. Maybe I'm on Dorsey overload, having breezed through the first three novels in as many weeks, but this one didn't do it for me. It does definitely have it's moments. Serge addressing a college campus on graduation day after building a following both in numbers and prestige is hysterical. The climactic chase scene is well written echoing that of the wackiness of simlar scenes in movies like ""What's Up Doc?."" If I had to list these in order of favorites thus far it would fall like this.1. Orange Crush2. Hammerhead Ranch Motel3. Florida Roadkill4. Triggerfish TwistIf I were to read this somewhere further down the line (after a much needed break) I might give it a third star. It's still a fun read, and I love Serge's obsession with Florida history."
5,The Craziest Block of Nuts in America,"I'm a straggler in reviewing Triggerfish Twist, but that's because I just read it again and was moved to comment. Triggerfish Lane is the nuttiest and funniest set of neighbors in non-existence. My favorite remains the fellow who got up in the middle of the night to ""stealth"" water. Coleman is always fun, but add him to a housefull of frat boys, and he's a leader of men. Life's too short not to laugh every chance you get. This book will give you plenty of opportunity.Barbara DeShongmysteryshrink.com"
2,Cut-rate Hiassen,"When I was a kid, my family was poor, so I ended up being taken to the discount store and getting four-stripe imitations of Adidas shoes. They looked like Adidas from a (great) distance, but they fell apart in weeks.This book is akin to those cheap shoes: it's kind of like one of Hiassen's comedic books for adults, but it falls apart when you read it.A positive point is that I actually laughed aloud two times while reading. A negative point is that the book is only a series of set pieces that are supposed to be funny but have no structural justification. Hence, if the gags fall flat, as most of them do, there is no reason to read them, as they do not advance the plot (there being no plot to speak of) or convey necessary background.The book's light reading and I did manage to finish it--this I wouldn't have if it had taken more than three hours--but I wouldn't recommend it, though I wouldn't actively warn anyone away, either."
5,Hysterical,This book had me laughing out loud from beginning to end. Serge's Commencement Speach was a winner. I have reread it at least ten times.
4,What a Lucky Discovery!,"I bought this novel without knowing anything about the author's prior works, an impulse buy at the bookstore. Not many authors can make me laugh repeatedly, and at length, but Tim Dorsey can. At the time of writing this review, my first on Amazon, I am purchasing the rest of Mr. Dorsey's efforts. Enough said."
5,A book that has been with me for over 15 years,"I read this book when I was a child in elementary school. Of course, then, I did not realize how much the story affected me. Now, I am going to hunt to the ends of the earth to find this book for my future niece/nephew (the baby won't be born until September)."
1,Keep Searching,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! The narrator is boring! The books he narrates are CLASSICS but he reads so matter-of-factly that it is sickening! He lacks a thorough appreciation for such classics and it comes across in his reading of the material. He whizzes through them as if he is reading a textbook! Surely something can be gained for newcomers who listen to the CDs, however, if you have previously read the Classics and wanted an audio version for enjoyment or reinforcement of the material, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
2,Ho Hum,"I was looking for something motivational and this nearly put me to sleep. While one can pick up some good points from the stories, I wouldn't recommend this if you have a short attention span and seek something with some action."
3,"Great books, not so great in THIS format","I must agree with other reviewers that the narrator is a great person to listen to if you need to get to sleep! Great information, poor narration."
3,"good stuff, poor narrating","The narrator of this (audiobook) can turn any masterpiece into total junk. He sounds like Ben Stein on Valium. The Science of Getting Rich, also, is mostly a bunch of rehashed baloney."
4,sjp,Corner Gas is a great show. Totally funny. Although we had some problems with this DVD. It works on 1 out of 3 of our DVD players.
4,Corner Gass season 3 delivery,I was very happy with delivery of this product. The only complaint I have about ordering through Amazon is that you can't always tell if DVDs will be wide screen
3,Decent charger with very limited advantages,This charger is good for a person who is travelling and does not need to lug on a laptop for charging via USB....otherwise the time taken for charging the Archos is roughly 4-5 hrs similar to the USB charging....so there is no addded benifit for fast and quick charging with this charger.
4,Fallen: The Complete Series...,Fallen: The Complete Series with only 3 parts ( could have been more) would even be better if it has Seasons!!! What it lacks is there's no Special Features or Bonus materials ...
4,Not bad book is always better though.,Pritty good but does change the story line some from the book. All in all as a stand alone movie it is good.
2,Love Paul Wesley,Not the best acting by rest of the cast but I enjoy anything with Paul Wesley in it. Mini series split into 3.
2,Interesting Concept With Potential,"I was intrigued by the concept and the plot. However, at least on Blu-ray, the movie was not a seamless story; it appears as if it was put together from cuttings. The end leaves unanswered questions and there is no reasonable hope for a sequel."
1,Get Better Actors next Time,"I started watching this after reading the first book. It was horrible! I couldn't even get past half an hour the acting was so bad. The one plus was it had cool special effects, but other than that, it was terrible!"
1,Don't watch it!,I haven't read the book and to be honest I really don't want to after watching this DVD. I love the main actor and yes there are some good parts but to be honest I was fast fowarding so much of this DVD so my review is just don't do it!
3,ehhhhh so so,It was ok they miss way to much from the book and changed to many things..why can't they just stay true when making shows or movies from books..we would be more happy
4,An insightful and comprehensive study on worldwide market trends,"Blood in the Streets presents an articulate and comprehensive study into the countless variables that are required to assess market trends. If you have ever encountered instances where an analysis, possibly even a very convincing one, appears to only encompass localized fundamentals, and you questioned the strength of such a forecast, this book will unmistakably assist you in defining the failing of such an outlook.Blood in the Streets presents a very convincing case for considering worldwide fundaments in addition to localized trends. The book further incorporates the steps encouraged to undertake such a comprehensive analysis, backed fully by an abundance of examples.By now, this book is somewhat outdated in terms of its relevance related to current events; however, its means of study and course of action to seek out opportunities among the trends is absolute. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking insight into any market."
3,He asked for it.,This was on my husband's birthday/Christmaswish list and he received it. According tohim it was okay but he will be taking it tothe book exchange....not a keeper.
2,not worth the price,the video looked like it was made by just regular guys. Not very good quality...and not very informaive.
1,Movie Vhs- They Came From Within,"The VHS tape worked fine. Dust cover showed signs of wear. Product came from rental store, so that's to be expected. However the movie I saw was not the original...like it was when I saw it in 1974. Scenes had been edited, or cut out completly. The scenes cut were the 'steamier' ones. Obviously some uptight censor got hold of this film after I had seen the original in 1974. Because of the cuts the movie was hard to follow, and lost the parts of the film that made it 'interesting'. Bad flick!"
2,Read the song list carefully..,"Pay special attention to the songs you are getting. If you like Lynn Anderson Sings Anne Murray and Patsy Cline's unknown hits, go for it. For my taste, Tammy Wynette's disk is the only one of the three worth keeping. Just make sure you read the song list - learn from my mistake! ; )"
3,Not bad,I like this because the ball has a very nice controlled feel coming off the paddle and this is probably a good one for an experienced beginner. You can generate a good amount of spin and my only complaint is really about the springiness of the core which occasionally makes the ball go long. Now as for the handle I really dislike the AN grip i think straight or flaired are much more comfortable.If you are a beginner looking seriously into table tennis get a blade and attach rubbers and forget this premade stuff.
3,Nothing to do with law,"It is not a cientifical book, just gossip and some data: is just some information togheter, and all could have been said in just a page. It repites several times the same concepts."
4,More reference than cookbook,"This cookbook was an enjoyable read, but more as a reference work on the food of Paris than a comprehensive cookbook of Parisian dishes. The pictures are gorgeous and inspiring, but the recipes limited in number. It covers in great detail the everyday foods that make Paris so wonderful --- the different types of cheese, bread, coffee, etc.As a cookbook, it's quite limited and far from comprehensive. It is, however, quite refreshing to have a cookbook with such detailed information on the regional background of Paris to whet your appetite for the recipes."
2,Tried two recipes and failed miserably,"I think this series (I also have the Florence book) gives a nice overview of the typical dishes for the city, but I am not going to trust their recipes again, after trying two and failing miserably. They simply do not list all the necessary ingredients. I challenge anyone to try to make the crust for the raspberry tart described in the Florence book. It just doesn't contain enough liquid to be anything but a couple of cupfuls of floury dust."
2,Good Book for Newbies.... Not so good for anyone else!,"I expected more from this book, and I did not find it.In my opinion this book is a great read for a mom who wants to take cute pictures of her children.This is not geared towards a professional photographer. I am an advanced armature, and found this book a bore. There are a few cute posing ideas, but not much substance. A lot of the pictures have that hazy glow going on, and not very many clear, clean, professional quality images. Overall disappointment.I was hoping for more guidance on the technical aspects and more detailed posing ideas and tips. If you are a aspiring photographer, pass this one up, you will be glad you did."
2,Not for advanced amateurs,"This book is simply too basic. I regret I bought it, as the other book that I bought is much more detailed and not so general. Its good for those who just started making photos, but for those that know what is shutter speed and aperture its really too primitive."
5,"FABULOUS, BEST BOOK ON THE MARKET","perfect detail, great advice, not to technical, definatly the best guide to photgraphing children I have come across, and I have read plenty of others"
1,Miss leading reviews,Be careful when ordering this book. Take careful note that the reviews on the Nikon-Nikkormat Handbook are NOT reviews on this book but on a much newer version (2008) book on photographing children which was what I was looking for. It does show the correct book info in the product information but unfortunately that was not what I paid attention to. Very disappointing
3,so-so,"This book is notable in that there is advice for and examples from people with P&S; cameras. Mind you, that's not what I was looking for. Much of what's here isn't specific to shooting kids, but it could be valuable to a parent with little prior photographic knowledge. I had hoped for tips/tricks on shooting my elusive toddler, but found little relevant to me.I happened to catch a couple of nice shots of my toddler ""reading"" this book and emailed them to the (local) author, who couldn't be bothered to reply."
2,Easily destroyed,"My lab mix is a power chewer, and other Orbee products have stood up to the non-stop gnawing. This ball was in pieces in fewer than 24 hours. He did delicately pull off the ""Woof."" in blue, but that was fine with me. He attacked one of the treat holes and had it peeled away within a matter of hours. Disappointed in this product, but the glow-in-the-dark Orbee Planet Dog ball holds up well."
4,missing woof,"Great ball, but it took less than one day for our year old golden retriever to remove the blue WOOF inset from the ball! Mybe it should be secured better or removed completly. The ball itself is great and or dog loves it!"
4,It won't stay cute for long,"These balls are great for my Lab/vizsla who loves to destroy things, but he pulls the letters of within minutes. The rest of it ball is very durable and bouncy. He really seems to love it."
2,Disappointed...,"I was very disappointed with this product. At first, I was happy to find a pink ball for my female Rottie, especially one that was rated for strong chewers. Unfortunately, she started pulling it apart in the first 5 minutes. The ""woof"" writing on the ball are raised letters which she hooked her teeth in and starting pulling apart within a few minutes. I would not recommend this to anyone with a strong chewer."
3,"Different Color, Different Rating...","I am somewhat perplexed...the pink Planet Dog Orbee Tuff ""Woof"" Ball is identical to the green version, bearing the word, ""Fetch"". Other than a difference in color and the word on the ball, the construction of both balls is identical.Yet, the green version has a lower rating and a slightly different price, too!Can someone please explain this?"
2,My Dogs love these balls but,I have 3 American Bull Dogs That I have purchased about 6 of these balls for but it takes them less than a month to chew them down to half size.I haven't bothered to check on the warrantee. I may as well have Alligaters.
1,are u freaking kiding me,they charged me 16.00 dollars for this tiny little ball what a rip off.dont order this ball you will be sorry what a joke
5,Tuff Woof Ball-Pink,Great ball. Still being played with daily. Great too because you can find it in the snow.....yeh.
5,i use these tongs for getting stuff from drains????,"i have no small creatures but these tongs are great for a lot of other uses...cleaning articles dropped in drains, finding and removing small items from odd spaces and anytime you need help getting stuff from crevices ie dropped pills, beads, etc...i even used it to remove some stuck paper in my printer...i bought some as gifts for some of my senior citizen friends so useful!!!"
3,"Works great, not rust-proof",I use these to target feed some creatures in my pico tank. After a week of use they show signs of rust. Now I'm having to look into painting or powder coating them. Other than that they work great.
4,Good pair of tongs.,Fantastic pair of tongs I bought these to use as a planting tool for my aquarium and they get the job done. Feeding reptiles is easier too. If your looking for tongs that make a smaller hole I suggest you buy thinner tip tongs. But if you are looking for cheap and get done I highly recommend these.
3,Art in a Pen,"We bought the Spyro Gyro pen for a Hanukkah present. My daughter was very excited to use it however, two of the pen tip colors did not work properly. It is also difficult to find the correct amount of pressure to place on the pen to get the desired shape. I would not recommend this for young children. My daughter is 9 and is having trouble."
2,"cool idea, didn't work long","This is a great idea and my kids loved the pen initially, but it broke after the first day and never worked again."
1,None of the inks work,"None of the original cartridges worked so we made the mistake of ordering 5 new refills and guess what? None of those worked either!! They had all drid up!! Don't waste money, the idea sounds great if it actually worked. I tried many pens cartridges but it is not a standard size and it needs it's own specific cartrdige. For the price you'd think they used better material."
4,fun 'Regency' read,"This is one of a series of Kasey Michaels Regencies with overlapping characters - I think at least one before this. See Amazon for synopsis. Interesting (engaging) dynamics between father and son regarding the good deed the son needs to do, and some mystery regarding who Miss Adams is - we do get glimpses as we observe the 'bad guys' plotting. Romance wasn't particularly intense."
3,Cancer Surivors,"As a breast cancer survior, I needed to watch this movie. There are so many reasons to give up going through the process of being a cancer patient, so I wanted to see it from a different perspective. The reason I gave it three stars is because instead of focusing so much on his running, I believe it would have improved the movie if they would have focused more on his emotional state at each juncture of his journey. They don't really bring it home how difficult it is to take each moment and live in that moment, because that is all anyone has whether a cancer patient or not. He ran through the worst part of one town and made it through alive, yet cancer patients everywhere get thrusted into this positions because of the financial burdens associated with the disease. Overall, I am making the point that the producer did not do a good job a tying the two issues together, yet they are the same emotional journey. All ""hero's"" have the same character traits."
2,Weak at best,"Tried this product for about a week. My roommate has a mobile unit mounted in his car. On transmit, he could hear me about about 1/4 mile, no further. On receive, I could hear him for maybe 1/2 mile or so. Tried it out on the highway, could only get snippits as I went by. Go with a mobile unit with a big antenna if you actually want to have something that works. Better yet, get your HAM ticket and get 50 watts of transmit!"
2,Not as advertised...,Decent quality and generally user friendly. BUT it does not have NOAA weather channels as stated in the editorial description. It only has the standard 40 CB channels. The range is limited but in general what I expected from a handheld CB. Most of them have limited range. My main reason for buying was the NOAA channels and the ability to monitor CB from my house near the NYS Thruway and when traveling. I'm returning due to the lack of NOAA as stated.
1,Midland 75-785 portable cb radio,"Bought to use on a motorcyle (with headset). Unusable. Transmits fine when sitting still, other than that worthless. Going to throw away and try something different."
1,bad radio,this radio does not work like the company says it will. you have to be very close to talk less than 300ft. poor service on the highway. do not buy unless you plan on using a external antenna.
1,junk,don't waste your money.Has a range of ten feet.better quality found in the toy section.spend a little more on one that actually works.
4,Hubby likes it,I bought this for my husband and he seems to be quite happy with it. It must work because I've heard him talking on it. Much quieter now then years ago when he used to have one but his also a Ham so it's enough.
1,Pile of Junk!,"This CB radio is a pile of junk. Right after the return window ended, the talk button stopped working. Then, shortly after the speaker started fading in and out. Consider this a throw-away CB, or a toy that will last a couple of months."
1,Poor radio,"The walkie talkie does not go farther than one block. I purchased 3 portable CB radios thinking they would do the job, however, very poor cheap radios. I would not recommend anyone buying them."
2,You get what you pay for,"I used to drive a semi. Now I have a local job and drive a different truck every day. I missed the CB. This thing was not the answer. You have to turn the radio down to hear anything. It gets horrible reception and when I tried to get a ""radio check"" nobody would ever answer me back."
2,JUNK!!!,"It is a waist of money. I can barely pick up people in the parking lot at work. Can not get to transmit, will try to get an external antenna. By the time I put a new antenna on it, I could have bought I much better handheld."
1,Item FAILURE,ITEM DID NOT WORK WHEN RECEIVED.....OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT PRETESTED PRIOR TO SHIPPING.........I HAVE A PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED ONE...AND IT DOES NOT WORK.
1,CAN EVEN TALK FROM 1 ROOM TO OTHER ROOM JUNK,PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK COULD NOT GET RECEPTION EVEN BOUGHT GOOD ATTENA STILL COULD NOT CONNECT I THINK IT IS JUNK.
1,Won't work in the rain,Used this radio one time on my motorcycle. It rained that day and the radio quit working
1,Junk. Buy something better.,"Reception is horrible. Range is near-worthless. The stock flexible antenna has no range whatsoever - it was near impossible to talk to someone two cars away using this. Switching the antenna to a DIN telescoping one helped - you could talk to the truckers if they were less than two or three full truck lengths away, but that was holding the antenna out the window. Construction quality has a very cheap feel to it. If you;re considering buying an inexpensive handheld CB radio - don;t buy this one. Spen a little more and buy something of higher quality with consistent good reviews and proven reliability."
1,Hand Held CB,Even driving on the freeway with trucks around me no one could pick me up. I could only hear talk from a few hundred feet away.
2,Underpowered,"The reception on this unit works fine. Transmission however is a problem, no one seems to be able to hear me."
1,Hello?,I've had this radio 2 weeks. I sit high and directly across and 1.2 miles from I 280. I've heard chatter on 1 channel. No one has responded to my requests for radio test count. Still don't know it it works!
3,ok,"I seem to receive ok in the car, but other drivers tell me to get my radio fixed anytime I transmit something. My transmission actually comes over my radio speakers and squeals. Maybe if I get an external antenna, it will improve. It is nice and compact. Odd that the channel display disappears when you adjust the squelch. It says it's supposed to do that in the manual, so it's a proper function, just odd. It gets me the info I need, but if you want to transmit in a car, get an external antenna."
4,"Great for outdoors, very good price",This is a very good CB handheld. Long range even in a dense urban environment (at 4 watt power TX). Much better than FRS radios that I have already used. Taxi drivers and truckers could pick up my signal as far as 4 miles away. A signal meter could be a good improvement.
2,Midland Radio,"This unit works well in open areas. But if you are inside a car or house, it won't transmit effectively."
1,Not good at all.,"When I got the product, the antenna wasn't included and the power adapter that came with it works 1/2 the time. I spent an additional 16 dollars to get an antenna and adapter to plug it in to the cb. I'm extremely disapointed."
1,useless product,"I bought 4 units, they were useless at more than 10-15 yards, crappy Chinese off-the-shelf radios selling for 5$ would have probably been better."
3,midland cb,It seems to receive well but it lacks in transmission even at short distances. I ordered a stronger antenna and I hope it helps. It is very compact and appears to be made well.
2,Doesnt work very far,"This product does not work as described. First off the directions and the product description tells you it will work with a 12 volt adapter... Well it does, but not over about 30 feet. You must have batteries in them to get enough wattage out for distance, but even then they work less than 1/2 a mile. Which is 3 1/2 miles less than they say it will work."
3,A good entry-level CB,"Hi there!I'm not a radio expert or even a radio enthusiast. I needed a CB radio to better communicate with other Jeeps on the trail so we know what to expect ahead, what direction we're heading, or if there are any stucks/break downs. It does all that just fine and at a smidge over $30, it is a great value. However, the mike is a little over-sensitive and it is hard to tune down static without completely squelching out the signal. The range inside a Jeep is around 1 mile, making it good for short-range communication only. Outside, maybe 2-3 miles.I like that it is not a permanent mount as well. This makes it an ideal CB to use as a loaner CB for the guy who shows up to the trail without a radio.This is not the CB radio to get if you are looking for the biggest and best. This is a great CB to get for only occasional use and non-permanent install. It works for what I need it for, so I'm happy I bought it."
4,Midland 785 works on the motorcycle,We were looking for a inexpensive CB for my wife to use on her maxi scooter to communicate with me on my Goldwing when we were riding. I bought the little Midland CB and we tested it around town it worked well. We attached it to the back of the windshield with adhesive velcro strips so we could take it off when not in use. We recently got back from a 755 mile trip to the Smokey Mts and it performed very well. We could talk clearly as we rode. We used an adampter from Air Rider to plug into the radio to allow a push to talk on the handlebar and plug the helmet headset into it. Rig was great. Think I will buy another for my scooter now.
5,Highly Recommend - Fast Shipping - Would Purchase Again,"We purchased two of these radios and were pleased with their performance. CB or 11 meter doesn't have good range - but even in bad conditions we can communicate one mile from our home - and this is what they were purchased for.My wife and I are Ham Operators. We've been asked to do Emergency Communications for our church. We use our Ham Radio 2 meter rigs, but we needed these Midlands so we could communicate with local church leadership by radio - these hand-held radios met our needs.It's great that the operator can adjust their power settings. The mics pickup your voice well and the speakers allow you to hear well.Buy a set today and enjoy!"
4,Vietnam on Film,"These film essays look at documentary filmmaking and news reporting on the Vietnam War. I read this book as part of a film class at in college. This book is best for a person interested in the representation of war, especially this particularily divisive war will be moved by reading this book."
5,Racous wit and biting satire!,"This first volume in Uproar's new The Comedians Of The Year audiobook series showcasing the talents of four diverse and very funny stand-up comedians: Richard Jeni, Margaret Cho, Brian Regan, and John Pinette. Splendidly recorded live and on location, their raucous wit and biting satire is augmented by near perfect timing and intensely personal presentations giving the listener four hours of laugh-out-loud entertainment -- and looking eagerly forward to a second volume."
1,"Not for ""most"" Sony Camcorders.","This battery fits a bit more tightly than the others on the HDR-CX150 camcorder, and works for few minutes, than a message appears:"" Cannot work with this battery"".The voltage is the same as the other more appropriate battery, same size, a bit different shoe plastic, but it fits the camera where it should not have in the first place, and operates OK, until finds the battery is not right for the camcorder and shuts down the recording."
5,Solves a problem for me,"In Mini-DV, the tape size is short enough that a long-life battery isn't all that important, but I use my camcorder for underwater video in a housing. If you snorkel for hours, you need the longer battery-life because you have to leave the camera on in case something come by. The price was really good on this battery and it doubled my cruising time."
4,"Great battery life, but gave out after 1 year...","I was a little shocked to find out that the battery has died after about 12 months of moderate use. I don't recall ever seeing this problem with lithium batteries for other devices, even other Sony products. It actually has started leaking, as there is a green crust around the contacts. I've never left the batteries charging for more than overnight.The battery no longer charges. On the other hand, the stock FP60 that came with the camera is still working like a champ."
5,Much better than the one that came with the camera,I bought this battery for the DCRDVD610 camcorder and was much better than the one that with it. I went on a trip to London and was able to record videos using the LCD for a whole day without running out of battery.
1,Under performance,"Even after charging full, it shows only 136mins remaining. Whereas SONY claims it will give you upto 4.5hrs (270mins). I am going to return this product."
4,Sony NPFH70 H Series InfoLithium Battery for Camcorders,The only negative about this battery is the size of it -- larger than the one that came with the camera which makes it hard to fit it and the wires into my little camcorder bag.It holds a long charge and I never ran it out yet. I took it on vacation and took lots of video. I did recharge every night but I probably didn't need to.
3,recording time on HDR-SR10,"FYI, this NP-FH70 indicates 149 minicamcorder mode)) 211 min (photo mode), though it meets the claim in the package 3.5 hrs, however this is only for photo mode, not recording time, I did not buy NP-FH100 because it is too huge, and total recording time on default (NP-FH60 90 min) and this battery should be enough for a day's trip. it is up to your decision if you want carry 2 or 1(NP-FH100). I prefer to carry 2 batteriesD"
1,never receive it,i order it but never receive it and when i call they said its out of stock. never i will order from inspiretech again.Sony NPFH70 H Series Actiforce Hybrid InfoLithium Battery for most Sony Camcorders
2,"Average Function and Over Priced, It Is Sony!","Sony used to be a good brand, but not any more. Now they are average technology with worst customer service, and high price.This one is bulky, and not very powerful. It takes long time to charge, and loses power if not used. If I had the choice, I would buy a generic brand. Also, is this one risky for an explosion? Who knows, and I regret my purchase."
2,"Slow, slow, slow shipper - even paying for regular shipping","My feedback is more about the seller than about the product. Slow, slow, slow shipper!!! Normally, I have found that when you pay the regular price for shipping, the item arrives within 2-3 days. Not this time; 7+ days and still waiting (from Colorado to Albuquerque)! I'm not ready to only blame the USPS - the seller should know which shippers are historically prompt and which shippers are historically inept."
5,Works With My Camcorder,I haven't had the backup battery very long so I can't say how durable and lasting that it is. If you are wondering if it will work with your camcorder - it worked with my Sony DCR-DVD610 DVD Camcorder perfect.
3,Cant seem to get it to fit,I just bought the Sony Handycam DCR-SX63 and cant seem to get this new battery to fit so im returning it
5,highly recemmended item for the camcorder,"Extra battery is highly recommended for the camcorder. You don't want to be stack in the beautiful place with no power in the camcorder :). This battery has more capacity than standard one my camcorder came with, and it uses quite accurate technology to report the amount of power left. Overall, I am pretty happy with this battery and usually cam go for a couple of days of shooting without recharging one."
4,Misleading specs (lasts 150 min instead of 6 hours) but good replacement,I'm giving it four starts because:1. lasts longer than the supplied battery but disappointing since it's advertised to provide 6 hours of usage.2. Doesn't stick out of my camcorder (HDR SR11)Overall I'm pleased with my purchase but wished it could last longer.
2,Bad batch!,"I received a battery that has been opened up from the case.....when I tried charging it, it couldn't hold beyond 100minutes....the other battery I have can charge and last up to 150minutes.....I bought this extra battery with opened case from amazon....I wonder why it happened and I wonder how I can get a replacement on this one! Amazon's quality control is deterioration I would say.....I used to trust it when it comes from them but this order made a lot of questions left unanswered!"
3,Not Impressed with Seller,"Purchased the battery from TechGlobal, monitored the arrival date on Amazon and waited 14days and had not shipped. Emailed seller twice with no response, and suddenly the battery showed up from a private residence in a small bubble envelope with no packaging, shipping invoice or guarantee. Contacted Amazon and was told to return the battery for refund at my expense to the seller. The battery looked like it had been used when it should have been new. Sony and Sony accessories are top quality products, but beware of some of the sellers on Amazon."
3,Can't supply what they advertise.,"I bought the featured deal of battery + charger. I bought it specifically from this seller and not one of the others b/c the combo + free shipping offered made it cheaper. They couldn't supply the charger and were slow on shipping the battery. Interestingly, they still advertise the charger! So, I have to buy it again, I didn't get the combo discount and now I see they are offering the battery for less here. Not satisfied with the service."
3,Waiting for a response on an overcharge,This item was given as a gift. When ordering it I pushed 2 in stead of 1.They billed me for two and am waiting for the credit on the one I did not get.The person I gave it to for Christmas was excited about having it and has used her camera constantly since Christmas.Please forward this question about getting my acct credited to the proper department so I may receive credit ASAP.Thank you. Dorothy May
2,read your manual,"Product charges quickly (as advertised),only provides 170 minutes of available time ( 6.5 hours advertised) on my DCR SR300 camcorder ( which is correctly stated in my Camcorder manual),. So recording time is Camcorder specific"
4,Good for the first few years.,"I bought this battery 4 years ago and it did charge my Sony Handycam DCR SR45 for about 12 to 13 hours but over the years it has been losing its juice. The max I can get out of it now is 10 to 11 hrs. but still. 11 hours of charge time is way more than needed! Make sure if you are buying the battery to fully charge it and if you get less than 10 hours, return it because its too old!"
2,Didn't hold its charge,I'm not sure why as I've purchased the Sony batteries before but this specific time it is not holding it's charge. I'll put it on the camera and after about 2 minutes it shows 65% less battery life. Not so happy with this shipment!
1,Quit working after 30 min was in the middle of recording a concert.,"Quit working after 30 min was in the middle of recording a concert. Was fully charged in prep for this lucky I had a backup but did miss a small part when it stopped said the it had lot of time left as I was monotering the time, I can't recomend this."
2,Don't work,"When I recieved the battery, I tried to charge it, it would not charge up don't know if it was a bad battery or not. I just retuned it. I would think that the battery would have been tested before they are ship for sale. This is not an indictment of Amazon, it was the prouduct that was bad."
4,Great Choice,Got this to supplement the smaller battery that came with the camera. This one gives me plenty of juice for filming most of the day without sticking too far out of the back of the camera.
1,Does not hold charge,"I find it hard to believe this is a genuine Sony battery, even though it has a Sony label. I bought it to replace an old Sony battery that started to lose it charge rather quick, due to its age. This new battery loses the charge faster then my old battery, maybe I get 10 minutes if I'm lucky.. Save your money and buy a good battery somewhere else....it may appear to be a good bargain, but it's a waste of money when it's useless."
3,OK music - Mistaken artist for Michael Combs the singer,9-14-12. The music is ok and I will keep the CD. Be sure to claify who the artist is before purchase. I mistakenly bought it thinking it was of Michael Combs the singer of Christian music. I should have been more careful in reading the CD profile. I subsequently went to [...] and got the CD I really wanted.
4,Important history of the wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone,"I am writing this 14 years after wolves were restored to Yellowstone Park and central Idaho.Fischer's book describes the events leading up to the restoration in great detail. Some may find this tedious, but in the years since wolves were restored much mythology has been generated about the event.Wolf supporters and opponents have often forgotten or ignored who the principle characters were and why the reintroduction took place the way it did.Those interested in the facts need to read this book and keep it as reference."
2,Max Factor Moisture Rich Lipstick,"Not as creamy as I remembered, and also, it had a ""perfumey"" taste. The ones I have had in the past, were pretty neutral tasting."
4,We have had several...,"We have had several of these solar showers over the years and have been pleased with each one. We really like the easy on/off nozzle (as opposed to other brands that have a clip-type valve). Each of our showers have been HEAVILY used and abused and we always come back for more! As mentioned in other posts, we don't fill full, maybe only 2-3 gallons and have never had leaking or ripping. If you are looking for a decent shower at a great price, this is a good place to start."
3,Just Ok,"Not bad for the price however a few flaws in the design.1) It has a twist knob which can be very difficult to use while hands are soapy. Had to tie extra loop knot to hang the hose from, so didn't need to close off everytime.2) The spout port to fill the bag leaks while heating in the sun3) Left bag i direct sun for over 4 hours and water was luke warm (but warmer than the river water)All in all, sub $10 not a terrible buy."
4,Held up good but had leak through valve,This bag held up good during recent camping trip. Filled it several times during the week. Only Issue is you have to keep the hose and valve up above the water level or the water will drip out a little and you'll have to refill sooner. I used a carbiner and piece of rope to hold up the hose and valve.
3,"so far, so good","i purchased this because my water heater broke. after reading other reviews i decided not to hang mine because it sounded like the other reviewers whined about its performance a lot. it doesn't get hot enough, or that the seams broke after a couple of uses, or the water pressure isn't great! puh-lease, it's meant for roughing it. so far i have no complaints about it and it works perfectly which is why i only give it a preliminary 3 stars out of five."
1,chemicals known to cause cancer,I bought this camp shower and didn't even use it. On the box you are notified there are chemicals known to cause cancer in the shower. I promptly returned it.
1,Very Bad Quality,Very bad product. He/she has 2 problems: he/she becomes unstuck with easiness in the sides. For the above-mentioned my van you floods in the back part. Additionally when the weighing one with a rope to travers of a tree the support of which is sustained was unstitched and I allow to leave the white tube of support that originally place setting comes. It is an I waste of money.
3,Coleman 5 gal solar shower,I bought two after reading many reviews saying that theirs failed.I've had trouble with neither.Suspect the trick is don't fill five gallons in this unit: use two to three gallons.I went on a trip with a group of 16 people. 14 of 16 had these Coleman units. None had failures. Each only filled them 1/2 full.
3,1 out of 3 Leaked at Fill Port,Bought 3 of these for a recent camping trip. Used 2 for showers and one of them leaked at the fill port after the second day. The third hung in a tree so not sure if that leaks too since I never had it sitting on it's side to heat up.Amazon was nice enough to credit my account for the one leaking without having to return it.
1,piece of junk,this thing is a piece of junk.the showerhead/spigot sticks and cracked the first time we used it.the filler plug is hard to open.the handle/hang loop started tearing the first time used.I am returning it for a refund
3,As expected for the price,"I uses these on the weekends at my summer cabin (no water in winter). They do get very warm in sunlight or hanging near a wood stove. There is decent water pressure to wash long hair and I got two full showers with washing hair out of one bag. After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase 2 in case one broke, and it did after 2 uses. I then ordered a third bag to keep a back-up. The second broke about a month later. I am on the third bag now; I would be very happy with these bags if they did not rip at the seams, but I will try amore expensive, tougher material next time."
5,"Brilliant, and a conservative user of water, too!","Took it camping (Bonnaroo!). Filled it from the runoff from the coolers as the ice melted each day. Never needed more than 1/2 to 1 gallon to take as long a shower as I wanted. Even just suspended it from the side of my truck, when push came to shove, and knelt beneath it. A great product, at a good price!"
1,Coleman 5 gallon PVC camp shower,I hung the camp shower up and within two days it came apart near the top. I have an older shower that has lasted for 3 years. I am not very impressed with the quality of the workmanship of this item.
1,SPLIT AT THE SEEM,It was split at the seem and I was not able to use it even once. Low quality. Seemed like it would be good.
1,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy this shower!!! Similar to other reviews, mine also ripped at the seam after the 3rd use and after the second use the nozzle had a leak. I am currently awaiting the delivery of a different brand because I refuse to buy another one of these."
3,What do you expect for $9.00?,"I live in a developing country and do not have hot water. I use this shower bag everyday. I have bought 3 in the last eight months. The closure you use fill the bag lasts for a few weeks. This closure is on the bottom when you lay it out in the sun, so there goes the capacity to heat your water using the sun. After the closure goes, I use it by heating water on my propane stove and filling the bag with a funnel. After a while, the hose starts to leak in one way or another. Then you are in a race to get your shower in before all the hot water drains out. Once you hit the tipping point, you pull out your reserve. I have to say, however, that the one I am using now seems to be deteriorating faster than the last two. I'd be happy to pay 2x the price for one that lasts."
1,Horrible,"Bought this shower and the Summer shower, which was half the price of this Coleman. The Coleman is cheaper, poorly designed in comparison, and LEAKS!!! You have tolay both showers flat to get the water hot, and the cheap snap in cap cannot handle the pressure of anything more than a gallon of water....the other product has a SCREW on cap, a built in thermometer, is made of heavier materials, has a MUCH better handle, and shames The Coleman brand. I am starting the return process as soon as I post this review.....it really sucks and was a huge disappointment after comparing it to a different brand, at HALF the price....SHAME on you Coleman!"
3,I have read better,This book was not as good as the first two. This book felt like it was only half done. it stopped way too abruptly. i would have liked more of an ending.
5,The Best in the Series,"Ravenheart is one my my favorite works from Mr Gemmell and the best of the Rigante Series.The best book to compare it to is Legend; Mr Gemmell's potent tale of Druss. Ravenheart carries many of the themes of Legend, but the story flows a little better and resonates a little more because the author's has perfected his craft. The pinnacle scene of the book resonates with me still, over 11 years since I first read it.Huntsekker (sic?) is an excellent example of what the author can to do edify minor characters. I could go into detail here, but I don't want to spoil anything.I honestly wish the Mr Gemmell was still around, I can think of few books that I enjoyed nearly as well as this one."
5,"Moving, Romantic, and Inspiring","Well, I think this is one of Gemmel's best novels. I was moved to tears. It made me think of ""Braveheart"" with the story line following Highland Warriors and problems with the lowland ""Varlish"" (English?) hmmm. what heroes and great character development and a great read."
5,Spectacular,"Never before have I been afraid that I was going to wake up my wife because I was crying too loud next to her until I read this book. I am a 6'4 230 lb. firefighter for Gods sake I can't be crying in bed next to my wife I said to myself. Little good it did. This book from it's beginning sucks you into a world of one character that I found myself apparently very attached to, Jaim Graimauch. He is the essence of everything great about Gemmell's writing. He is the type of character that inspires me to be better as a human being. I am not an overly emotional guy but this books ending is a goddamn tear jerker. Tough guys beware read it alone. F'ing five stars"
5,A Turn for DeBest,"Excellent! I found the tale strikingly familiar and accurate... With a story that pulls one in, and its charming characters ( Go Coop :) ) I'd recommend this book to most anyone interested in its type!"
4,Very pleased!,I was very happy with the condition of the book. The book was just as they described and it arrived quicker than expected. Very pleased!
4,Good,"It could have been quicker in mailing, but good speed nonetheless. Product was in great condition."
2,"Nice for tea, but not yerba.","A lovely product, but not useable for drinking yerba from a mate'. Too bad. i think the holes need to be bigger for that. The company was very kind to us in returns."
4,Nice glass straw,"Filters well and plenty long, well built straw.Only weird bit is the tip is squished down. It's probably for flow regulation.It'll probably be hard to clean the inside. I haven't needed to do anything more than run some hot water through it though."
2,Not the original,"I was looking to replace my original poster, but this one's colors were off and it did not match the decor. Otherwise, it was in good shape."
1,Gaffed and Stripped,"This is my first stripper deck so I might be wrong. I was under the impression that this is supposed to be a regular deck that is ""stripped"". The deck I received is ""stripped"" but over half the deck is also ""gaffed"" cards. There is no way I can fan these out our have someone pick a card without it being obvious that it is a trick deck. Half the cards are double faced, two suits on one card etc."
3,Cut Poorly,"Either my standards are too high or this deck has a very bad cut. Besides being excessively rough and misaligned the backs are also crooked, though not severely. Though I still plan to use the deck in order to preserve the Split Spades stripper deck I have (which is excellently cut and smooth), I probably will not buy this particular item again. As a nice bonus, the deck comes in an original Rider Back box instead of the new Standard box. If a spectator questions the cut of deck I plan to rant about USPC's move to KY as an excuse.Even so, I urge you to only ever buy stripper decks made from USPC cards. For example, even with this fairly low-quality deck you can still pull half the deck back out if you riffle it backwards - not so with the cheap plastic finish of other stripper decks. I would much rather have a poorly cut deck that handles like a Rider Back then a straighter cut deck that handles like packaging tape."
5,Nice quality. Thanks so much!,Works Great! I have been doing magic off and on since I was a child. Nice quality. Thanks so much!

4,Great!,"Mr Piston is one of the few authors I have come across who has a thorrough understanding of the limitations of the instruments he chose to write about. One can see this especially through hid portrayals of reach, uses, effects, etc.However, it is worth noting that he could have used a bigger variety of examples from different composers. He also abides to the most common and stereotypical manners of combinations, etc."
3,A thoughtful writer,"I learned loads from Piston. Written in 1955, bits are dated. 'You cannot study music with records, you have to sit with the score in a concert'. Someone doing this to day would be an incredible nerd. But it is well written. Description of instrumentation is easy to grasp, although registers in the brass squad are always a bit of a handful for a non-brass man. Perhaps I found the accounts of the violin, the oboe and the harp best. The analysis section was a bit heavier but the last section is easy reading. Piston teaches well the relation between melody, secondary melody and accompaniment. Different textures in orchestration are reasonably well accounted for. I recommend Piston as a supplement to Blatter's Instrumentation and Orchestration, which is my Bible in the field. Well, they are both kind of Bibles."
5,Chinese Folklore and the History of the Lim Family,"""Parasol Tree Village"" is more than just a delightful story of the Lim family. In addition to providing detailed genealogical charts, this little book includes not only charming legends such as the story of the Tree King God, but also the family legends, nursery rhymes and lullabies that are a part of the author's heritage. Ms. Lin summarizes in an interesting way the tale of Emperor Zou, his vicious nephew-emperor and his evil concubine, Dah-chi. She also gives an account of the belief in the Goddess of All Trades, Mah-tzo. All of this is written in a beautiful, poetic style. The reader will discover unexpected gems; an explanation of Chinese astrology, and beautiful sayings that were handed down in the author's family, one of which is ""A centipede has a thousand feet, but it crawls no faster than a snake"".Anyone interested in folklore, the cultural heritage of the Taiwanese people, and Chinese history should own this small volume."
2,2 of the 3 stories were good,"I wasn't sure that I'd like ""Risky Business"" but I was pleasantly surprised. The adventure was interesting without being too involved, and the romance and relationship built very nicely.The same cannot be said of ""Storm Warning"". There was no romance in the story and the male protagonist was hateful. The story, beyond the love story (if you can call it that), was interesting. It reminded me a little bit of some of Agatha Christie's stories.""The Welcoming"" is a very nice story about a man ready to learn to love and a loving, giving woman. Likable characters.This book isn't Roberts' best but the first and last stories are nice reads. If you can get passed the nasty male protagonist and the lack of romance in the second story, you might find the mystery interesting."
2,Not for die hard fans!,"I gave this book two stars - one for Risky Business and one for The Welcoming - they are typical stories written by my favorite author. Predictable, yes, but enjoyable. Storm Warning made me mad. I wish I had not spent the time trying to figure it out, It made no sense! Do not buy this book. Go check it out at the library and read the first and last story, but skip Storm Warning!"
3,First story great....and that's where it ends.,"I can't beleive I actually found something written by Nora that I did not like. The first story in this collection is excellent and is worth purchasing the book for. However, the second story is horrible and the male character is just a major creep. I almost didn't finish it. The third story is OK, and worth your time to read, just not her best. I LOVE Nora, but that second story just didn't cut it. If this is your first Nora book - PLEASE go get something else by her - anything - don't let this one turn you off to her. I feel guilty writing this!!! Sorry Nora!"
2,What a difference 22 years makes...,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, but it is evident in these early works what a difference 22 years of writing has made for her.These are so-so short stories that show hints of her current style without the polish.Risky Business and The Welcoming were okay - nothing special - but could have used a little more character development. Okay as a short stories go.Storm Warning was definitely not her best effort and could have used about 100 pages of character development to explain the history of the two lead characters - especially the male. (Maybe his character was indicative of the time it was written in and the style used back in 1984.)All in all an interesting look at her early efforts/style, but her more current works are much better."
4,I love Nora Roberts,I love Nora Roberts but this was an early writting and not her best. It's an OK book for easy reading.
3,NOT HER BEST WORK BUT IT WAS GOOD,"This book was a good read, but I was very dissapointed with the last two story's. Risky Buisness was a very action packed read, and had just enough romance in it to keep you intertained with the story. I did not like Storm Warning or The Welcoming that well however. They were both good read's, but they did not have enough action in them. I would not recomend this book to first time readers of Nora Roberts."
5,Keychain Wallet Card-Holder,"Well-made and attractive. Really useful, too. With this wallet, I can often shop without a purse."
4,"Zildjian 16"" Custom Crash","This cymbal is very nice - has a very interesting crash sound and decay. I have many vintage Zildjian cymbals, and kind of prefer the older cymbals a bit more - they certainly are much heavier in weight in comparison to this particular cymbal and have a more clearly defined crash sound and longer decay."
2,Who could possibly read this?,"Absolutely completely confusing text. Poorly written, difficult to understand and extremely wordy. Author takes a moderately complex subject and creates a monster of confusion. The absence of a good bond graph text probably holds back the proliferation of this modeling technique. Amazed the authors didn't attempt to simplify or condense their work after three text revisions."
4,Useful old edition,"The new edition was kinda pricey, but this was a very good substitute for it! The theory is the same, and most of the practice problems are, too."
5,Great stories about the people as well as the immunology.,"This four-part book tells of cancer immunotherapy with: (1) Coley's toxins around the turn of the century; (2) interferon after its discovery in 1957: (3) T cell growth factor (interleukin-2) after its cloning in 1983; and (4) tumor vaccines in the 1990's. There is more detail than you think you want to know; but after getting into the book, you don't want it to end. Readers looking for additional insights might consider ""Biotechnology Backstage"" from Kabel Publishers, which covers the rise and fall of Cetus Corporation (a story Steve Hall does not tell but says is worth telling) and the dawn of gene therapy (which spun off the use of interleukin-2 to grow tumor infiltrating lymphocytes at the National Cancer Institute)."
4,a romp through tumor immunology,This is an engaging read! An excellent introduction for the reader curious about the history of cancer biology/immunology especially from the standpoint of clinical therapies. It also provides a glimpse of the inside workings of research institutes and scientific collaborations. The only reservation I have is that the prose tends to the purple but that is not too great a distraction from the skillful storytelling. Read it!
2,Very Brief,"I was looking for a biography on Albert Ellis and assumed this was a detailed biographical artical. It is not. It does contain a complete list of his writings, but very little information about the man himself. I would not recommend it."
1,What is the point?,"Mom mother-in-law gave this set to our daughter for Christmas. I just don't see the point. The CD-rom is not Mac compatible. The French words are just basic counting, colors and shapes. The set comes with a small stack of flashcards and a couple of less-than-thrilling books. What I don't understand is that the books are in English, how is this helping a child learn French? It really just seems like scattering of poorly designed teaching tools in a big fancy box. Total waste of money."
4,Best of the bunch!,The only problem I have with this scent/disk is it can't be found anywhere but online! But the smell is wonderful...I have used everyone and I am without a doubt in love with this one!!!
4,Good Scents,"I like this disc. It has some really nice scents on it. I wish it were a bit stronger, but this is one of my favorite of the Scentstories disks.It has mulled cider, baking pies, gingerbread, cookies, and another one I can't remember. Five scents in all"
3,old,this is not a good product for me did not realize this has been discontinued and they wer just gerring rid of a old product
1,Used Product,"I order one of these because I could not find them anywhere in stores. I love the machine but my old discs ran out long ago. I was excited when I found these however when I got them they were old, used and dried out as much as the ones I had just discarded. It was pretty obvious I had been sold a used item with no sent at all. I would not recommend placing an order."
4,OTTO x 8000 BC,"The last track, is more than worth purchasing the CD.the rest of the CD, is more than worth purchasing the CD."
4,Great little knife.,Bought one several years ago. I use it almost daily. It is light weight and easy to maintain. One side panel did come off but I fixed it and haven't had a problem since. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great pocket knife.
1,Snips do not perform well for the construction trades,"I bought both left and right compound snips in order to try out a brand that was guaranteeing their product for life and to check out the claims the salesman made on how they extensively researched the use of this tool in the field.Let me make this quick. As a sheet metal worker these snips are the worst I have ever used. The head is too big to cut in small spaces. After a little use the jaws would open so wide that they would lock themselves open, and it would take 2 hands to get hem closed. Not good when you are on a lift 25 feet in the air trying to make a 1 handed cut.If you need these for work, don't bother, they will disappoint."
3,AIR BRUSH TATTOO FUN TO PLAY,"More fun than the sticker tattoos in that you can personalize it with your own colors. The ""airpens"" dry up pretty quick but we still have fun playing with it."
2,Somewhat Disappointed in this Conclusion,"I LOVED the Christmas Box and bought several copies for friends. I enjoyed The Timepiece but not quite as much but it would still be in my Top 20 books. The Letter, however, was a big disappointment. I felt it didn't remain true to the characters and I especially didn't want David and Mary Anne to have problems and waste precious ""Time"" together. It may be a truer account of life but that's not what I was looking for. The other story line in the book was all that held this together for me."
5,Great Audio Storie,This is a great story from Richard Paul Evans. He has not written a story yet that I have not liked.
2,The Letter,Not one of his better books. I have read all that were written by Evans and I would have to say this is my least favorite.
2,This was a dull novel.,This was a very dull novel. It was very slow moving and left me wanting to know more about the relationship between mother and son. It was not as powerful and emotional as Timepiece was. I was disappointed in this book. The press built it up to be more than it really was. This is one book I would not recommend.
3,Great beginnings ...,"This was the weakest of the trilogy series, but nevertheless was well written in Evans' typical eloquent style. I love most of his character descriptions, and thought he did a splendid job in fleshing out David, Diedre and Catherine. But, unfortunately, he lost it with Mary Ann this time around. When I began reading the novel it was a struggle to put it down, but around the halfway mark the story seemed to lose its momentum and I started to lose interest. Still, I recommend it to all who have read his other books and quite honestly would put it between 3 and 4 stars. As usual the ending was touching and left me weepy-eyed. The main problem was the lag between the middle and the end."
5,Very touching...,"This is the finale to the Parkin's series. The story is about the lives of David and Mary Anne Parkin.Very touching book indeed. After reading the book, it feels as if you have known David and Mary Anne all your live. Reading about them makes you appreciate the people around you. To treasure the moments you have with them....Excellent book!"
5,captivating,"THE lETTER WAS THE FIRST BOOK OF rICHARD eVANS THAT i HAVE EVER READ, BECAUSE i BORROWED IT. i WAS VERY PLEASED AND HOPE TO GET THE REST OF THE TRILOGY. i DON'T EVEN CARE IF i READ THEM OUT OF ORDER. i HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TRUE FAN OF dANIELLE sTEEL{AND STILL WILL BE] BUT THIS AUTHOR IS JUST AS FANTASTIC AS SHE. tHIS AS THE BEST BOOK THAT i HAVE READ THIS YEAR."
1,Lots of boring talking- couldn't stand it,"I bought this, hoping it would have some fun math and reading games for my child, but it was so boring. It had this horrible voice repeating the instructions over and over again before you could play. Even a child with angelic patience wouldn't want to sit through that every time. It now sits in our house, never used...more clutter."
2,Bad organization of materials and bad DVD quality,"It is (supposed) for kids of 6-12 but my 8 year old (2nd grade) was very fruntrated to find the right questions/materials for her. There are no clear indications on 13 DVDs. Also, the DVD quality is very bad. Two of the DVDs could not be read at all from my new dell PC (maybe my cd-rom drive is not good enough but I never had problem to read other DVDs). BTW, I bought mine from Cotsco wholesale store."
2,Typos,this copy of the play had typos and for the price it should have included both endings. Buy this from another provider.
1,Theistic approach,"This works only if you are a theist. And once you ARE a theist, what power does death hold?"
3,Cambridge selling repaired bibles,"June 8 2005I ordered a Cambridge RSV353 Brevier (Burgundy French Morocoo leather) last week. After reading the comments on this board about duplicate page 51 and missing pages 95-96(John 7 and 8), I checked the pages in my copy. On page 95-96 of the New Testament, the original page has been cut out and the correct page glued in. So, my copy is one of the misprinted bibles mentioned in the other reviews that has been repaired. I'm not sure if I'll keep the bible or send it back and ask if they have one that wasn't misprinted in the first place. Anyway, I just wanted to alert buyers that the bibles being sold are the one's mentioned as having duplicate pages that have been repaired. Otherwise, it is a lovely bible and I would be thrilled with it except for the repair."
4,My high hopes are dampered.,"I absolutely love both Cambridge Bibles (I own approximately ten of them) as well as this particular edition of the RSV text. I read several of the previous reviews, a bit aghast that my beloved Cambridge University Press would sell defective or repaired bibles. I didn't want to believe it. Perhaps Amazon got a bum shipment...so I ordered mine from another on-line Bible dealer. Bottom line: I TOO RECEIVED A REPAIRED COPY OF THIS TEXT. It is very evident that in the New Testament, page 95/96 was glued into the bible. I have never experienced this problem with any previous Cambridge purchases and am sorely disappointed. Cambridge Bibles are not cheap. I buy them because of their high quality and therefore do not mind spending more for a high-quality product. I am truly sad that this publisher would sell second-rate products that have been repaired. I want to trust Cambridge because I love their bibles, but this was a disappointment."
4,The book & the Ancillary Package ?,"This might be one of the finest pediatric book that you will read . As a nursing student, this book save me a lot of time for my reading and give me the information that I want or needed upfront.My test result are great . Nevertheless, When I baught the book online it suppose to be coming with the Ancillary Package but I never receive it. I thing they should deliver what they advertise .This package was one of the reason that I decided to buy the book ."
5,Must Have,My daughter went back to school to be an LPN. An invaluable book and she got her license thanks in part to this book
1,Miami Dolphins: 1985 Team Highlights,"I NEVER received the item from Nana's Reading Room! My credit card was charged, and I received shipping notices but NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM! I even emailed the Amazon seller, Nana's Reading Room, but NEVER RECEIVED a reply. Can someone PLEASE help me get this video for my son.Sincerely,Michael J. Kitsockhome phone 570-628-3691Cell - 570-617-2376"
5,Stop Teasing Already,"They should Release the product or remove the ad. We loyalists have been tormented far too long. We check back on a regular basis for the same results. MORE WAITING! They never should have canceled the show in the first place. Joey was just as good as Friends ever was and it was aired for ten seasons. Matt was the best actor on the show anyway, well next to the chick and the duck."
1,RIP OFF,"Alright, I'm a big Friends and Joey fan, but this DVD set is just copied off the television and ripped onto homemade DVD's. NOT high quality and NOT worth the money!I know the last eight episodes didn't air in the US, but pretty sure it's still illegal to record episodes and sell them as the real thing."
4,Typical Network Idiocy !!,Season 1 was funny. Season 2 is funny. Network chiefs simply couldn't give a monkey's what people like - to them it's just a ratings war. Morons. Thank goodness it's not (quite) as bad in the UK where at least I can watch the whole of series 2. But I bet we never see it released on DVD.
3,Can't wait,"It is coming out in April 08 to Amazon in Canada and yes the DVD's do play on US DVD players, so like many I can't wait. I did enjoy the show though it was never reached a Friends level in quality but still good none the less."
3,Joey Season 2,Would you hurry up already and release this season. I would really like to see the episodes that NBC didn't feel like showing us!
5,Review of Hard Landing,"One of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. As an airline pilot, I have seen the same circumstances occurring in different countries to the present day.Highly recommended especially to anyone involved in the airline industry worldwide."
5,The Bible According to Crandal...........Wolf and Kelliher,"Dear List, If your into aviation, this is the book for you. I have to say in all my aviation readings, this is probably the best book I've read. Even ""Nuts"" dosen't come close, for historical value and a general pleasure in what makes these barons of industry tick. Whilst the book dosen't explore European Airlines or Asia to any extent, the fascination of the American giants is amazing, the book is well written, researched and expressed in a manner of ease. Sincerely, Tom"
3,Why Are the Airlines the Way They Are?,"I read this book in the hopes of getting a better understanding of why the airline industry is the way it is today, and I don't feel I really did. Petzinger seems very interested in the personalities airline executives, and discussion of the effects of political, social, technological, and economic events on the airline industry seems to take a back seat.While the book was fairly interesting, I found it quite slow to get through. I don't regret having read it, but I wouldn't be quick to recommend it."
2,Disappointed,"I have been TTC for 9 months now. I started this product about 7 weeks ago. I have always had a funny cycle and never know when I'll ovulate, so I figured I'd try this product to see if it will help make me a bit more predictable. I started this product a few days after my last period ended. My average cycle length is 35 days, and thats on a good month. I am now on day 53, I have not ovulated this cycle and have not had any period symptoms. Other than not ovulating or menstrating, the only other problem I've had is hot flashes. I had high hopes for this and I hope others have better luck than I. I would keep using this but not having a period is driving me and my husband bonkers, because without a period, I can't ovulate, therefore I can't get pregnant and that defeats the purpose."
1,Did NOT work for me,"rec'd my shipment on time. easy to take. 3 pills with brkfst for 3 months & i took one prenatal vitamin a day(Spring Valley brand)as well. Ordered product middle of July 2012. Started taking them last day of August cycle up thru October. Immediatley noticed nipples were hard on & off thru out the day. Breast were tender on & off during the month. no luck with baby dust. pills changed poop color & texture, after 2 months started to have blurred vision in my right eye when i would first wake up in the morning for about first 10 mins. It didn't work for me. good luck to others"
2,Caused almost PMDD-esque symptoms,"I don't know if it was just me, but within the first two weeks of taking FertilityBlend I expererienced a myriad of negative psychosocial effects. I'm already a bit of a loner, but I was feeling emotions of isolation, sadness, and anger, even in the presence of my husband and loved ones. The feelings broght me back to my younger days where I had a lot of issues with PMDD. I am a 22 year old female, overweight and with PCOS (from years of steroid threapy to treat my asthma).I think I will go back to the good old way of waiting for God to bless me with a son or daughter whenever he sees fit. :)I know FertilityBlend is not a one-size-fits-all formula for conception. So take my review with a grain of salt...for you, it might lead to you achieving pregnancy with twins. But I do have a medical history of PMDD and it intensified my negative symptoms. And it still didn't cause me to come on my period."
2,Buy Vitex Instead!!!,"I took FB for one month with no results. I bought a 2nd bottle, thinking that I just hadn't been taking it long enough, but when I opened the 2nd bottle, the pills were a completely different color than the first bottle and smelled much stronger. This suggests to me that the amount of vitex in Fertility Blend is not the same in each bottle, which is a serious problem. The pills don't even tell you how many mg of Vitex you are getting in each pill.I started taking Vitex and returned the 2nd bottle of FB. The first month I took Vitex, I had a 28 day period for the first time in my life. I have pcos and this really helped me! I did not get pregnant my first month of vitex, but this is the 2nd month and I took ovulation tests this month and my ovulation test was positive today. I highly recommed Vitex instead! And it's only about $10/bottle."
2,Don't take it if you don't need it,"I took it for three months, but it did not help me. My periods used to be regular, but while taking these pills, they became shorter. I believe it did not help me with ovulation. When I stopped taking it, my periods took like two months to become regular again, and to see the signs of ovulation."
1,Never helped...,"Fertilitea Blend never helped get my cycles back to a ""normal"" place. I took it for 4 months with no luck. Switched to VITEX capsules and got pregnant within the first month and a half. Helped me ovulate regularly and shortened the LONG cycles I was experiencing. I wouldn't use this product again. I would just go straight for the Vitex capsules."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"I Try 3 Months.it didn't adjust my cycle,always delay my period,sometimes 21 days,sometimes 2 months,i put my dream on it ,it doesn't come true.."
2,"Be careful, talk to your doctor before you try.","Friend of ours told us about this dietary supplements and we were excited to try them with hopes that they would help us have a baby. My wife and I tried womens and mens version, but after a few weeks later after taking them, we developed severe allergic reaction on skin and face (acme, itching, etc...).We should have talked to a doctor before taking these...."
3,Pregnancy Blues,"I used to have extremely painful cycles and I wasn't ovulating. After seeing all of the positive reviews I wanted to try this product. My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for some time now. I started taking FB in January 2011. I immediately saw a difference in my cycle. I was for the 1st time on a regular cycle and not to mention they were very easy have. A lot different from being stuck in the bathroom sick for 2 days. However, I still wasn't ovulating. Being hopeful, I kept taking them. In August 2011, I had my 1st positive ovulation test. We were ECSTATIC. I ovulated every month after that until this month (January 2012). I didn't ovulate this time. I am undecided on whether I will continue this product or not. Hoping to get pregnant soon. The cycle of hope continues."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. It really got me on track. I am still not pregnant, but I have very regular cycles. I am very hopeful."
2,I didn't care for it,I used this product for a couple of months and I did not like how I felt while using it. I had increased pain during ovulation time. The pain was so intense that I had to stop using the product. I don't have problems with ovulation so maybe this product was not something I should have been taking or maybe I should have taken a smaller dose than what the product instructed.
5,It worked!,"I had tried for 4 years without any ""help"" before conceiving my son. I believe that because of Fertility Blend my son was concieved. It took about 4 months of usage. I am currently trying to concieve again after a miscarriage one year ago and will start using this product again."
2,It's not about Rudolph.,"While our 7-month-old enjoys the colors and textures of this cloth book, I don't enjoy reading it to him. Despite the title and cover illustration, the book has nothing to do with Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. Each of the book's eight pages features a brief rhyme and an illustration of a Christmas-related scene: carollers, stockings, a tree, Santa, etc. There are no reindeer mentioned or pictured in the book. Apparently this is one of those Christmases when Rudolph was left at the North Pole.I get the distinct impression that this book was written by a middle-school student and never saw an editor's pen. The rhymes are weak and obvious, and on the last page of the book the verse inexplicably changes from present tense to past tense."
4,This Knife is the Prettiest Thing I Have Ever Seen,"This paring knife is the prettiest thing I have ever seen. Available in 6 attractive colors. The knife's non-stick surface coating is a clever idea. Why they have not think of it before? It helps to make the blade to glide with less effort. Perfect size for peeling fruits.It comes with its own sheath that is very useful when you bring the knife with you. Kuhn Rikon is a Switzerland brand, the knife is made in China. Still, this is my favorite knife that I bring with me at work."
1,Chinese junk,"I was under the inpression I was buying a knife made in Switzerland. When I recieved the knife it has Switzerland all over it, but it felt funky in my hand and a closer look showedKuhn Rikon 4-Inch Nonstick Colori Paring Knife, Purpleit is in deed ""Made In China"" and in small print on the package back says so as well. So be aware that Kuhn Rikon is made in china , not Switzerland."
4,"works well, does the job","this knife is surprisingly sharp. wanted a knife with a cover so i could use it at work for my fruits and veggies. I am pleasantly surprised. it cuts well, is a pretty color, has a cover... all the things that I wanted. I've never tried it on anything particularly hard so I can't judge how it will act in those cases. But for my apples, kiwis, potatoes, etc. it worked well."
5,Great Paring Knife,"Very useful tool that I use every day! I sharpen it once every month or so, and have not had any of the coating flake off. The knife is hand washed, like every knife should be. A lot safer than the dull things I was using before!"
5,knife review,"Love this knife. It is wonderful and works great on vegetables, fruits, etc. Am thinking of buying more from the maker. Easy to handle and makes slicing a breeze"
1,Plastic and made in China,"Unfortunately all these reviews are not reflecting what you really get, a knife with a cheap very slippery plastic handle. This is not the quality I expected and a shame for Swisse craftsmanship. The balde is sharp so far, however other than it slips out of your hands and you cut yourself useless"
4,Good value knife with nice features.,"I got this knife in black. The knife itself is good, although perhaps a bit light. For those that are interested the blade is beveled (it is hard to see in the picture), and I found the edge to be not as sharp as I would have liked (personal preference).Perhaps the most useful feature about this knife is the sheath. The plastic sheath is made to fit the knife perfectly and is vented to allow for drying. I have found that when the blade is inserted in the proper orientation, part of the sheath designed to hold the blade in place sometimes catches the blade, making insertion awkward at times. All in all the sheath is great. It allows me to be a bit more careless with the knife and I can pack it in my back easily and know nothing bad will happen."
5,Most used knife in the kitchen,"After we received this knife, it has become the most used knife in the kitchen- that's right, I use it even more than my chef's knife now! It's perfect for hulling tons of strawberries, cutting fruit, and doing small jobs that don't warrant bringing out the bigger guns (i.e. my chef's knife). It's sharp, attractive, and has a handy protective cover so that I can just store it in a drawer with the butter knives and I don't have to worry about it getting dull or cutting somebody. I only wish I had more of these knives... maybe I'll buy another one some day in a different color!"
5,WORKS WELL,THIS KNIFE IS NO SHARPER OR HOLDS ITS EDGE ANY BETTER THAN MOST KNIVES. THE SECRET IS THE COATING ON THE BLADE ALLOWS IT TO SLICE THROUGH MATERIALS EASILY GIVING IT THE ILLUSION OF BEING SUPER SHARP. ONE SHOULD BUY IT .
1,pretty much a waste of money,Knife was not particularly sharp. I wouldn't buy another. I'd return it except it did not cost much and is not worth the hassle to repackage.
2,not sharp enough,"I ordered this knife in several colours but the purple one always seemed to be dull - I had my husband sharpen it a couple of times - it may just be a fluke, but of the several I have, this one leaves much to be desired - all the other colours seem to be much sharper."
4,Excellent paring knife,"I recently bought this knife at a Sur La Table store and find it very handy. The plastic cover/case works well which is handy because there were no more open slots in my knife block. The blade is wonderfully sharp, and as another reviewer noted, food doesn't stick to the coated blade.The only reason for not giving it five stars is because the handle can be a bit slick. If this had a rubberized or more textured handle, I'd give it 6 stars."
3,Fun little knife,"I purchased one of these knives for myself last year to use for camping/travel type stuff. I recently purchased several more to use as stocking stuffers next year. The knife is not quite as sturdy as I would have expected, but it's sharp, I like that it's serrated, and I love the knife guard that accompanies it. It's small enough to store easily in the glovebox or your camping gear and just large enough to handle little slicing/prep jobs on the road or at the beach/campsite. Not for the real jobs in the kitchen, but useful if you need a knife away from home. And, bonus: it's very cute."
3,Easy to get knicked,"I love having a purple knife with a sheaf for it. The blade is good and sharp. It does fit well in my hand. However, I have knicked myself several times because the back corner of the blade is not protected. You can see it in the picture and it's quite sharp and easy to get a finger too close when you're busy doing something like coring and apple or getting the stem off a tomato. I wouldn't replace it if I lost it or damaged it."
5,Best knife ever,"Love this knife - got it in all colors and believe me if you are looking for a knife that is just handy to have around and cuts well, this is it."
5,Superb knife,This is our 4th knife of this brand and type. We first bought this at a local grocery store. We've had no issues putting these into the dishwasher for over a year now.
3,Not so sure,"I'm not so sure about this product. I used it on my legs, and it did not get very much hair removed. I then tried it on my face, and it seemed to work better on my face. The pieces are sort of small, so it really does not cover very much on your legs. I also tried it on my underarms, and it did not work at all. I think I would use this again only on my face, but not on my legs, and definitely not on my underarms. I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds, as rubbing it between your hands does not warm it up enough. It is not a product that I would fully endorse anyone to use."
3,Better Value then Sally Hansen,"So anyways, I got this from this vendor, which I didnt notice it said it'll take 3-4 days to process order... I think its actually took longer, it took FOREVER, so I wouldnt get from this vendor again, and not to mention I saw this on [...] that gives free hsipping on orders over $[...], but anyways that didnt effect my rating.My problems with this product was that it doesnt grab every hair, and that it just cuts some hairs... I think it grabbed around 85%-90% of the hairs, so thats kindve annoying, but what I like most about thsi product is the quantity there are large strips that you can cut into smaller strips, and you can reuse the strip a second time, third time if your lucky, but only with really light hairs, youll have to dispose after one use with difficult hair."
3,Waxing your own legs really really hurts,"This is probably a great product, its the only product of this nature I have ever used, but i hated it. I have a high pain tolerance. I dont usually mind getting my legs waxed... by SOMEONE ELSE. Waxing your own legs hurts like a mo fo and the results weren't that great. Probably do to user error. Try it though. see for yourself."
3,ok,"They were ok, got some hair, not all. It is quick to use but as I said will still have to do follow-up as it is not going to work perfectly. Still nothing better than true hot wax."
3,Sort of worked,They sort of worked. They got most of the hair off but there were still a lot of little ones left. I bought two boxes but I actually needed three or four to fully wax both of my legs. At that point it is cheaper and easier just to shave.
1,Did not work for me,Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens. Would not recommend to anyone.
2,Parissa legs and body strips,I have thicker hair and this product didn't work as well as I hoped. It left behind large patches that I had to go over multiple times until they were removed
4,"Very good, not great wax strips","Very good product overall.Sticks less where it shouldn't than other strips.One recommendation that works well for me. Instead of warming the strip in your hand, use a hairdryer. I find it to be really effective and fast!Not a lot of pain while using the strips, but I'm used to waxing, and a lot of the time, frequency is what makes it less painful."
1,Quick & Easy Wax Strips - Leg & Body,"Does not matter what I do, i still have to use rasor after all. No, I do not like this product."
5,Marilyn mug,"This is exactly what my wife wanted. Great quote inside the mug. ""I just want to be wonderful"" My wife is extremely pleased"
4,GREAT,"I LIKE THIS THIS MUSIC AND ALSO THE RAP AND SINGING FROM THE GIRL, FOR ME IT IS A TOP 100 SINGLE."
4,A Strong Release,"This is the first Plaid CD I've ever purchased. I'd say it's quite good. Very good ""background music,"" if you will. It doesn't hold my attention to the end if I just sit down to listen to it, but it's nice to just put on and chill. In a vein similar to Boards of Canada. My favorite track is the dramatic ""New Family."""
4,Radiohead is dead here is Plaid!,"I've been collecting electronic albums for almost 5 years and this one is the best I've bought! This music has a soul and a meaning of it's own. It's a shame that more popular Rock band like Radiohead with their sad ""amnesiac"" are more focused by the media. The first song, ""Eyen"" will grab you into an album experimenting with styles like Trip-Hop, Ambient and Acid-Jazz. A fresh journey to the music of tommorrow.Great album!"
1,1.5 Plaid are one of my favorites ....,"Tracks 13-19 (mostly co-written with others) almost reach the edge of decency, but the bulk of this 70-minute disc is a real shocker! Forget the intricate, intelligent composition they've become known for. This is mostly electro that sounds like a few kids tried a to play piano for the first time and someone directly translated their musical thoughts into techno sounds and basic beat loops. I know that sounds really harsh, especially since I love Ed & Andy and so highly praise their former work, but this really IS bad!! I can bearly listen to it, and only if I'm feeling particularly masochistic. Sadly, I will have to listen to any work they put out in the future in advance just in case it's as shallow as this."
2,Second rate autechre,"I brought this album on the recomendation from a couple of people, but never really got into it. The first two tracks I thought were good, and I expected them to grow on me more but it never happened. If anything the oposite happened. I became less impressed with it everytime I listened. I think tracks like 1 and 2 are what Plaid are good at, but the glitchy stuff with all the electric pianos and gameboy noises just come off as second rate Autechre..."
2,Broken Clip,Clip broke on case side after 4 mos of light use. Had to repurchase another holder. I did NOT purchase another Krusell. Only had a 30 day guaranteeKrusell Orbit with Multidapt Leather Case for PalmOne Palm Tungsten T5 / TX. I hope not to spend $40.00 dollars every month!!
2,shipping sucks,The shipping method sucks and all of my items came seperately. I didn't realize that I was buying from different people. My credit card was charged different amounts than what I was quoted when I made the purchase of all of my items.
1,Not for Christians,"This is a book on what is called ""Hoodoo"" or witchcraft (not be confused with Wicca, which was created in 1954). If you look at the author's other books, he was an occult book writer."
3,"An ""OK"" HAIR...Nothing Special","You can read about the history of this recording in the other posts... my only ""two cents"" is that there were some tracks on the ""FRESH HAIR"" release that topped their American counterpart ""DisinHAIRited"" that I wished had been included on this cut. Also, I'll put in another cry that ""The Flesh Failures""(to me, the whole soul of this musical) wasn't included- that is a true crime!Otherwise, the performers ALL are lacking in charisma and voice to the OBC. I never really cared for Paul Nicholas(Claude)- he's especially lacking in vocal talent as ""Jesus"" in J C SUPERSTAR from the start. If you only want ONE recording of the show, stick with the Original Broadway Cast...for the most part, they are unmatched on ANY recording of HAIR (and I've got about 40 cast recordings of the show!)."
3,"Not bad, but not that good either","This Hair album has some OUTSTANDING highlights (""Manchester England"", ""Going Down"", ""Easy To Be Hard"") but it has some really TERRIBLE parts too (""Aquarius"", ""Hair"", ""My Conviction""). I am deeply in love with both the movie soundtrack and the OBC, and there are ""some"" songs on here that I think may surpass both versions.Paul Nicholas has an outstanding voice as Claude but he is not energetic enough for my taste, especially on ""I Got Life"". He seems to be just singing it, but with no emotion.I forgot the young man who plays Berger on this album but his ""Donna"" is mediocore. And ""Donna"" is my favorite song in the show and it was real disapointment to me to hear the performer's voice crack during the high notes. I think someone else sings ""Going Down"" (It might be Gerome Ragni from the OBC) , but he is fantastic on that song however.The Hud and Woof are impressive too.Don't buy this album, ..."
1,Hair,"Searching for a rating below the lowest. This London cast it terrible, their performances totally uninspiring. Donated to Good Will."
5,Excellent devotional on various aspects of prayer,"Evelyn Christensen's devotional breaks down the complexity of prayer into precious nuggets that offer sustenance to both the new Christian and the more experienced pray-er. She addresses prayer ""closets"" for personal praying, praying in groups, spiritual warfare, and many more. This is my favorite devotional on prayer, and I'm so disappointed that it isn't available from the publisher any longer. I have purchased it as a gift before, and the receivers loved it as much as I do."
3,"Does what it says, but poor quality sound","It's a good doorbell, but the speaker quality leaves something to be desired. No matter how good quality the audio that you put into the thing, it comes out sounding really flat. I may look for something else, but in the mean time, this works nicely.Current doorbell noise: ""*knock* *Knock* *Knock* Penny? *knock* *Knock* *Knock* Penny? *knock* *Knock* *Knock* Penny?"""
2,J T ..... all good........production NOT!,I grew up listening to Johnnie Taylor from back in the late 60's and up until he passed away. I have just about all his music. I never actually seen JT perform live in concert so it was a true blessing to see him on DVD. I will say that a much better product could of been delivered for all the many fans of JT. I will also add that this true soul legend deserved atleast a tribute on this DVD. Sound and picture were good and that's about it. JT RIP.
4,Fan of JT,I'm a fan of JT so anything that I see or hear him in is all right with me. The second dvd with JT live at longhorn is much better with shots of the people enjoying JT music. Any one who is a fan of JT will enjoy this dvd.
4,Nice Item...Expensive Shipping,"Product is as described and of decent quality. The price for the item was resonable, but shipping was way too much. The shipping cost was more than the cost of the item and it was not even recieved quickly in relation to the expense."
2,poor quality!!,"My daughter has thick curly hair. The satin pillowcases keep those curls from turning into massive knots. We have ordered satin pillowcases for years from one source that has recently stopped carrying them. My daughter was thrilled when I found these. Now, after two washings, the material is shredding right at the seam. In two places! Very disappointing. The search goes on for high quality satin pillowcases."
3,"Nice, but...","Bewared ---- I haven't had this for 3 months, and the stitching around the zipper has already unraveled. Secondly, the pillowcase is fine, in fact I really like it, However, I thought I was getting 'a set' of pillow cases not 'a' pillow case. I realize that I should have read more carefully so this is my fault. However, usually they are sold in sets, so be careful. The zipper is nice, but I would have rather had a set of regular constructed cases, than one zippered pillow case."
1,"Poorly researched, thin, bias, socialist propaganda","This book is the worst kind of biased liberal journalism in that it implies that everyone with an opposing view is a racist. The book is thin, ignorant of the facts, and one-sided. The book is about black athletes affected by racism, but why does the author always use racism as an excuse for everything? In Zirin's world, no black athlete can be held accountable for his actions, is responsible for his own actions(ie: Ricky Williams, Barry Bonds), and it's disgusting the way the author uses racism as a defense mechanism to any counter view. Worse, I believe the author is dishonest. He takes his point of view, not because he believes what he says, but because it's the only platform he can find to write inside of. Besides that, the book is thin, poorly researched, and the interviews are self-serving. Is there any athletes' behavior that offends this author?"
5,Finally! A book that tells it.,"Dave's ability to connect the dots of how society influences sports and the other way around helps expose that the real problem with sports isn't competition or over paid players but that sports in America mirrors our society, so if we want to fix the problems in sports, we need to look to fixing the problems in our society as well. Sports is not an a-political bubble that somehow exists outside of society but is actually a place for amazing acts of resistance, solidarity and struggle."
4,What's My Name Fool blew me away!,"I have recently finished reading ""What's my name,fool"" and all I can say to everyone even thinkingabout reading it is, what are you waiting for? Amust read for anyone considering themselvesthinking, feeling sports enthusiasts, firebrandprogressives or just about anything between. What'smy name is as sharp a critique of modern-dayathletics and the society it reflects as I have everencountered. My only question is, where the hell hasDavid Zirin been, and why haven't I heard of himsooner. Keep on telling it like it is David."
5,Even better than the cover suggests,"I could write a book about how good this book is.I skip school, sleep, and basic hygiene habits toread it.The issues discussed are not merely those of theAmerican sports fan's interest, but the interest ofthe American.If I could be one person in this world besides TomHanks, I would probably be Dave Zirin.If you are a human who plans on living in this worldfor an extended period of time, I recommend that youread this book.Everything down to the structure of the book is very well thought out, with chapters within chapters tokeep ADD kids like myself entertained.If we are going to wave the flag of a country thatclaims to be a place where freedom, liberty, andequality run rampant, then we should first worktoward erasing racism, sexism, bigotry, and allother forms of injustice and hate in our owncultures.Thank you, Dave Zirin, for opening my eyes to thetruth about sports and their relationship toeverything else that goes on in our lives."
4,"Thought-provoking essays, but already getting a little dated.","I'm now a big fan of Dave Zirin. A thinking man's sports writer with a sharp (left) political analysis. He's had me completely rethink (and develop an appreciation for) Barry Bonds, Terrell Owens and Ricky Williams. My only complaint is that it was mostly short essays. While that made it hard to put down (""Oh, I'll just read one more...""), I really wanted a complete and connected narrative. I guess I'll have to read A People's History of Sports in the United States for that."
2,What gives books by journalists a bad name.,"As one who reads and writes sport, and is a political progressive, I was looking forward to a book that took on the sports establishment. I found this book a great disappointment, however. It reads as if it were slapped together in a hurry without much thought given to organization or coherence. This is one more book that begs the question: what do today's editors do? Certainly they don't edit. Zirin weakens his thesis by repeatedly overstating the case, stretching the point, and taking cheap shots. I wish he would have put some more time and effort into this. Dave Meggyesy (who did the forward) wrote a much better book. Read Harry Edwards or Jack Scott if you're interested in this topic."
3,Are We Being Watched?,"There is a chapter in this book entitled Are We Being Watched? And another chapter entitled Can We Ignore UFO's? In this chapter they list some very good cases from 1973, 1974. They then proceed to talk about reflections in windows, etc. They then list Claude Poher's conclusions of his analysis of 1000 ""serious"" sightings. They then give more positive possibilities. Guess they dont want to commmit. They should put more research into the very reports they list in this chapter. There is also a chapter entitled The Bermuda Triangle Bunkum. Book is mostly about previous space exploration, Voyager, Mars missions, etc. And of course about sending and receiving signals through space. The future of mankind may depend on CETI. By the authors of Is Anyone There?"
1,"Dry, dull, vague & over rated - gave it 1 star because i had to.",I bought this book on the basis of the reviews here so i was sad to find that i hated the book & found it pretty useless.
2,Nothing special,"I have never been a big believer in psychology, and I find that giftedness is still a rather complex subject. This book will present some interesting hypotheticals to the reader. But, as with most books on giftedness, the focus is on excuses.So, take it with a grain of salt. If you are looking for answers, you won't find them here. I don't think we will ever know exactly what makes gifted people gifted, but thats the fun of it."
5,Lessons to Learn,"Good parent versus Bad parent. Gifted child versus tormented child. The lines are so thin. After reading the brilliant MY FRACTURED LIFE I began exploring the concepts of narcissism. PRISONERS OF CHILDHOOD presents very clear reasoning and some ground breaking philosophies and studies. In addition to MY FRACTURED LIFE and PRISONERS OF CHILDHOOD, recommended reading also might include THE WIZARD OF OZ AND OTHER NARCISSISTS, TRAPPED IN THE MIRROR, and CHILDREN OF THE SELF ABSORBED."
2,lasted 2 times - should have bought plastic version,"My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift this year from his Aunt. I'm not sure why everyone says it goes faster - maybe it depends on the type of snow you get??? We live in Chicago and just got 6+ inches of ""dry"" snow. We went sledding today with friends who owned the same Flexible Flyer only the plastic version. The kids all fought for the plastic one because it went much faster down the hills than the metal one. To make it worse the metal one weighs quite a bit more and was a lot of work for kids to drag up the steep hill. When we got home we noticed that there is a huge dent in the middle of the saucer now. Save your money and order the plastic version."
4,Saucers,Love them! Received promptly and just what I expected. Looked for these for years and always found the plastic imitations so was so thrilled to finally find what I remembered from my childhood to share with my grandkids.
3,Fun sled for one-time use,As mentioned in the other reviews this is a great sled but too thin to take any type of normal abuse. My 14 year old son used it one day on fresh snow and it looks like a beat-up fender from the wrecking yard.
2,Bent after 1day use,"I purchased this steel saucer for my daughter (Christmas 2012). Two days after Christmas is snowed--awesome and too the hill we went. We used this saucer 1 day and it was bent, lost the paint and was rough to ride (feel every bump). I purchased this saucer for $35, luckily I bought 2 other plastic saucers at Target for $6 each. They were great and faster then the steel saucer. Wouldn't recommend."
1,JUNK,"I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it with my own eyes. This sled lasted about 20 minutes sledding down 8"" of fresh powder. My 12 year old son didn't go over any jumps or do anything crazy, he just plopped his butt down and went. After 5 runs, the sled was unusable: dented in multiple spots and the paint cracking off all over the place. This thing is a veritable piece of junk."
3,"It's good, but I don't think it will last as long as I thought","The sled is good, fast, and easy to use. By only complaint is that the first time I rode it I created dents in the bottom of the metal sled. They were easy enough to pop out but the metal was weakened and they kept coming back, even with my 40 pound son riding it. Perhaps I was just too big for the sled. So now I wonder just how much damage this thing will take before I declare it dead."
2,Not as good as you would think,I thought i had purchased an item that was definitely a steal. Product seemed sturdy when it arrived...decent weight...made of metal and i couldnt wait to try it out with my familiy. Unfortunately after one run down the slopes it was dented in...I believe some other reviews had similar comments and so now you can add this one to it. Maybe its weight specific (didnt look into it before buying) but either way its too bad that a product that seemed to have potential failed the way it did. Maybe its better for smaller children who are lighter weight but this definitely didnt hold up for an adult.
5,I would recommend this!!!,It was given as a gift to a five year old little girl for Christmas. We have not had any snow here yet. It seems to be just like the ones we had and completely enjoyed children ourselves.
4,"Italy, Instruction for Use: book by Nan McElroy","A great size for travel, I didn't feel like a tourist when I went to Florence. I read through it on the way over and kept it in my backpack for when I needed to reference it for a word or a reminder.Thanks for helping me get the most out of my vacation!"
2,"Rip, nothing different","This is a total misnomer,it says on it's cover it will help even experienced travlers, NOT. There is nothing different about this 14.95 hand book except the size it's only about 100 pages and many with not much on them.Don't waste your time and money, there are many many better books on the market for the same price.I'm going to list it on another auction page for 5.00 that is all it;s worth."
1,For the inexperienced traveler,"Unless you really are an inexperienced traveler, and an American who thinks that staying in a hotel room that does not have an ensuite is unthinkable, this book is not for you. There is little here that you could not find in a good ordinary guide book.Nan is also inclined to romaticise. For example her notion that Italian drivers belong to a sort of community of the road and that they have a highly developed perception of what is going on around them that allows them to drive the way they do with impunity is simply not borne out by their shocking road accident statistics. And after 4 weeks driving on Italian roads my observation is that they are often simply just impatient and reckless."
5,Excellent Companion for smooth traveling,"I recently toured Italy for the second time with Nan McElroy's book in my purse. It was invaluable in getting my husband and me on and off the train and around town using both public transportation as well as the taxi. I particularly liked the information about tipping, restaurants and the Italian mind set. The vocabulary at the end of each chapter was helpful in formulating some halting Italian to order food and to find our way around Rome and Florence. Her information on money and protection from pickpockets was right on. I have traveled europe for over 10 years and found this book to be a most practical guide. I not only read it before I left home but as we were touring in Italy for it's helpful hints. The book is small and lightweight enough to carry in your pocket and made our trip completely enjoyable and easy."
4,An invaluable tool to help you enjoy Italy,"I travel to Italy often and I wish I had Nan's book during my initial travels because all the things I have learned through trial and error are in this book. I also learned new things as well..which will make my next trip to Italy less stressful. From the basic italian glossary to help you order your meals or ask for directions to the information on how to navigate through Italy to suggestions on what to pack for your trip...Italy, Instructions for Use is exactly that...an easy to follow and compact instruction guide. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family."
4,More than a charger,"In addition to charging my Nokia 6620 phone, this device provides a convenient place to ""park"" my cell phone when I get home. Before I got the charger, I would always have to pick up the charger wire from the floor or fish for it behind my dresser. Now, I have gotten inito the habit of automatically placing the phone on the charger when I change from my street clothes when I get home. And I never forget to pick up the phone from the charger before I leave the house. Great device! I've often wondered why the manufacturer Nokia does not make a similar device."
4,Horror-Comedy For The Whole Family!,"Saturday the 14th is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but I liked it. It's that rare horror movie spoof that the whole family can watch, like Young Frankenstein or Ghostbusters. It's not consistently funny or anything, but it does have some good laughs. What I liked most about the movie is the style, atmosphere, and the monsters. Oh, and the story."
2,"Uhhh, can't believe I liked this movie as a kid!",So I remember watching this movie numerous times as a child so I bought it to watch with my daughter. That's an hour and 20 minutes of my life I won't get back! It was way worse than I remembered! My 10 yo wasn't amused by it either!
3,Cute!,"Okay Saturday the 14th is not the funniest comedy movie ever made but I still liked it. It's just a cute enjoyable movie with some cute humor that satires horror movies and it has a good cast, Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss play a husband and wife and are married in real life and they were good in the movie as was Kari Michaelsen who is probaly best known as playing Katie, the eldest daughter in the sitcom Give Me A Break and underrated character actor Jeffrey Tambor was good too. Go buy or rent this movie on DVD or video!"
4,If you liked SCARY MOVIE ....,"I saw this movie 20 years ago and thought it was hilarious. It drags in parts and gets a little wierd at the end but if you've watched the older horror classics, e.g. Halloween, Carrie, you'll appreciate the jokes and humor. This movie was the prequel to movies like Scream and Scary movie."
4,If you're a fan of the Benjamins...,"No doubt most folks over fifty fondly remember Richard and Paula, and this movie is for them. The story's pretty silly, but what the heck. Since ""He and She"" isn't yet available, this will have to do."
4,Couldn't stop reading it.,"Crime wave is the book that made me the James Ellroy fan I am today. From the first sentence, I was hooked.Crime wave is a book of short stories, actual true crime cases, and a few essays written by Ellroy for GQ Magazine.Reading Ellroy is almost like singing along with a tune on the radio, it's all about rythm. Included are a story about Ellroy's Mother's unsolved murder and another fictitious story involving Dick Contino. The stories that I loved most of all though, were the stories told by Danny Getchell, the dirt digger for HUSH-HUSH magazine.All in all, I loved Crime Wave because it is a look at 1950s crime in L.A. I think Ellroy fans and non-Ellroy fans alike, should do themselves a favor and pick up a copy of CRIME WAVE."
4,the history of an average town in Germany and its Jewish residents,"Before The Fury: Jews and Germans Before Hitler, by Emil Herz, is the story of a small city in Germany and its Jewish community in the several hundred years leading up to the Nazi regime. It tells of social relations, historical prejudice, and the development of movements within the German Jewish world. This is one of the few books in English that focuses on the history of German Jews in the centuries prior to the Nazis, which is an enormous help in understanding the Holocaust and its historical context."
1,Description says six bags but you only get one,"Even though the description says, ""Pack of six, 11.5 ounce bag per unit"" I only received ONE 11.5 ounce bag. Buyer beware!"
5,sax music,"I really think it's important to be able to listen to music that gives praise to the Lord, played by my most favorite instrument, the saxophone! May God bless!"
4,Great AMERICAN made work boot,"These boots werebetter than I expected. After purchasing a pair of Thorogood ""Duece"" work boots to wear at the fire station, I was extremely disapointed when the soles on both boots actually fell off after less than a year of use. These boots were made in china. Sent them back to Thorogood and basicly got told to pound sand. I only bought these because its hard to find an American made work boot any more. The leather is amazing, thick and already soft enough to wear with comfort all day. Little to no break in required. And they look as good out on the town as they do at work. WIll def buy again even though im irritated with the company. Buy AMERICAN people! Spend the money up front and your boots will last longer. Not giving 5 stars only because I have only worn them for 2 days."
5,High Quality Boots,"Beautiful, High Quality, Reasonably Priced Boots. Delivered quickly. Would buy a thousand times over, but have a feeling these will last me awhile. Trust the people saying they run a half size large."
5,Love these boots!,These boots are so comfortable that I often wear them around the house. They are pretty good at keeping my feet warm and they haven't allowed any water to get in yet. It's nice to wear a real American boots that are so well made.
3,who gets the house?,A GOOD FAMILY FILM FOR ALL AGES. THE CHILDREN TRY TOGET THEIR MOM AND DAD BACK TOGETHER. THE CHILDREN ASKEDFOR CUSTODY OF THE HOUSE AND THE PARENTS HAD TO TAKE TURNSSTAYING WITH THEM. THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY NOVEL IDEA.BOTH MOM AND DAD LOVED EACH OTHER BUT WERE UNABLE TO SOLVE THEPROBLEM.AN EXCELLENT ENDING ON THE MOVIE AND GOOD LESSONS ON LOVE.
2,dried out,got it on time. Fit like it should. The black was dried out. Donated the printer and the ink to the salvation army. Bought a new laser printer.
2,Premium ink cartridges for Brother 3820CN printer,"The cartridges were installed and after i printed 20+ test pages and cleaned the heads about 20 times, the black and cyan inks were smearing. i can't swear that these cartridges are faulty, but i've never experienced this in the 5 yers we've had this printer. We had to run out and purchase a new printer so I could print my resume that a potential employer was waiting for -- not the best experience!"
4,enjoyable,"Yeah this is pretty cool stuff, can't wait to get more of their CD's to see what sounds they create. This CD is basically 100% atmosphere, so if you like that kind of music then this is probably the CD for you. Add on to it the descent lyric work even thought it uses a pre-establish and popular world Middle Earth.Dagor Bragolloch (sp) was my favorite song, but they are all pretty good, like Orthanc, Ungolianth, and passing of the gray company.Try this band out of you like atmospheric sounds with a catchy tune to every song and growling vocals. It can get redundant if you listen to it a lot, and I think this mostly has to do with the beat not varying very much. Regardless, this music is great to listen to while driving, doing homework, playing games, reading, etc. because it has that ""background quality"" or whatever."
2,"A bit too violent on the ""singing"" otherwise I'ts almost OK.","Tolkien influated music is hard to find anyware and when ye find it, it sucks! The artists are obviously satanists and it's hard to notice what the hell they are singing. The best about their music is the drums, it's arificial (synterziser made) though."
5,Best spaghetti ever made for the home.,"Kraft Tangy Italian Spag Dinner Kit 8 oz - 8 Unit PackThis is the best spaghetti mix I have found. I don't think spaghetti should have a sweet taste as most of them do. This is excellent. I add a bit of diced onion, diced celery and can of tomato bits and it comes out great. I serve it also for ""company"" dinners and all enjoy it."
4,Just like the old days . . .,"This was my favorite comfort food as a child and has not changed over the past 30 years. The quality of the pasta is poor, but I'm partial to the sauce spice packets which did not disappoint."
2,Mushy Pasta,"Well, the sauce is indeed nice -not too sweet -not to spicy or acidic with a good overall flavor.However, the spaghetti is a different matter. It cooks up to a mush (even with I adjusted the cooking time to fewer minutes) and has an odd flavor. I can't really describe it except for it tasted 'off', like it was spoiled or really old. I made sure it was not just that one box so I tried three of the pastas. Same.I will keep the sauce, trash the spaghetti, and use my own spaghetti.I will not buy it again as I have to throw away the spaghetti. Besides the sauce is not spectacular -just a pleasant flavor."
5,nothing like it,"this has been my favorite since I was a kid. Back home in Germany its called ""Miracoli""I use it with angel hair pasta. (dont like the kind that comes with the box)but the SAUCE IS THE BEST!!!!Yeah. I'm buying this just for the sauce!!!! 38bucks for 24 packets of this awesome sauce mix. Its worth every penny."
1,Pop-psychology at its absolute worst. Save your money and your peace of mind.,"Gamemaster is riddled with both presuppositions and circular logic. The author's unmitigated audacity to insult your intelligence takes pretension to an all-new level. Gamemaster is the most transparent and pathetic attempt for an author to simply make a name for himself than any other book I can ever recall reading. ""All is vanity."""
2,NOT FOR PRO,"THIS IS O.K IF YOU JUST LEARN SIMPLE STEPS, THERE'S LOT OF UNNECESSARY TECHNICS YOU MAY NOT NEED. OVERALL THIS DVD IS NOT GREAT AT ALL."
5,Ghost Dancing Sacred Medicine and the Art of JD Challenger,"Descriptive words of Ghost Dancing, joined with the timeless wisdom contained in the words of Native America. Couple this with the paintings of JD Challenger and you have an opportunity to not read about but really feel. This is not a book just narrating the past but speaks volumes to the future. This book called to me from the library shelf and I have ordered to place in a prominent place on my shelf. This is a book to share with others and come back to often."
2,So frustrating!,"These shoes look and feel very nice, but there is a MAJOR problem with them.The cleat mount is drilled for the wrong size screws. You can't use standard SPD screws (or cleats for that matter) with these mounts! ARGH! I had to drill and re-thread the mounting plate to work with standard mounting screws."
4,"Yes, SPD Compatible","These cycling shoes ARE SPD compatible. I had no trouble attaching my cleats to these shoes, so I'm not sure what the other reviewer was doing wrong. The nice thing about these shoes is that they are more ""casual friendly"" so when I ride to lunch at a restaurant I don't have deep MTB cleats on. They look like regular shoes. I do like my Pearl Izumis better as the Velcro straps cinch down on my foot more securely, but they look a little funny in a restaurant so the adidas do the trick for those situations. My big problem was the slow shipping from [...]. After I placed my order it took them NINE days to ship. From other reviews that I have read elsewhere this is a common problem. They did not answer the customer service phone number when I called, and email inquires regarding shipping status resulted in the standard ""we'll let you know when we ship"" response. I won't order from [...] again. The product was fine, but the customer service was severely lacking."
2,Lillian's Legacy is tough sledding!,I wanted to like this true story of murder and marriage in rural Iowa. I couldn't. It is tediously long and not written well. Boring boring boring.
4,Good Read,"This is a good read. Genesis was a great read so it is a hard compare. Don't let that stop you, though."
4,Thought Provoking Book on Barth,"Any multi-authored book on one writer/ theologian is bound to have high points and low points. However, this book is a must read. As an introduction to Barth's thought this is not for the beginner. It presupposes a fairly high amount of knowledge regarding Barth to be able to work through it. Having said this -- most of the writers do an outstanding job in interacting with Barth's thought. Webster's introduction is nicely done. Heron's conclusion and interaction with Barth's legacy is also beautiful. And then, its worth having the book just for Bruce McCormack's, George Hunsinger's, and Trevor Hart's articles on Barth. If you want to begin to understand Barth, this is a book that you must read eventually."
2,NOT JEWELERS SOLDER,"I bought this with the understanding that it was jeweler's solder, being made with silver instead of lead. and I get PLUMBING solder. Thanks for wasting my time. Shipping was great and would have been worth it if it was what I was expecting - updating the picture and description would be a GREAT idea."
1,doesn't do the trick,the only good use for this solder is to tin the gun/iron after you are done soldering. it comes in a coil instead of being wrapped in a plastic spool as pictured. this sucks.
1,wrong product,"Hi, I did order silver soldering for electronic component (HIFI) soldering and I did receive PLUMBING one!!!Are they counting on this?"
3,An ok set,"My two friends and I all bought a set of these because a disc golf course was set up on our campus. Although we're new to the sport, we all are athletic and have played Ultimate Frisbee competitively. What we've noticed with this set is that the disk chip and dent easily. The drivers all behave differently, but none fly very far. Our midrange disk tend to fly the straightest and roll very far (sometimes good, sometimes bad). At the skill level we're at, the putter doesn't make much of a difference yet, however the bottom edge is very sharp and uncomfortable to throw.This set would best be suited for family outings and younger kids. If you're going to play often and competitively, definitely buy a better quality set. What I've done is bought a new high quality driver and still use the midrange and putter."
2,Spend your money on better quality.,"I bought these for my husband who loves disc golf. After using them the first time he decided he need to buy the ""good stuff."" He said that they did not fly as well as the higher quality discs. So, if you want to have a good game get better discs."
3,love the color,"I absolutely LOVE the color and the way it looks on. However, it peeled off one toe within a day and within two days, it was peeling off the other toe."
4,Lots of fun with Jurassic Jumble!,It is a game with lots of fun and laughter..the only con is that the bones come with defect markings
3,fun game,"It is a relaxing game, especially after works and also suits as family game . It builds individuals speed on eyes and hands and bonding as well."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this item from Moss & didn't get around to unwrapping it for a month or so. Mostly got it because I've always had trunk racks on my sports cars. Unwrapped it today & really disapointed. The idea is good, but the execution if really poor. The parts were chromed before assembly & then welded together. Some of the joints look cold (not enough heat to keep the parts todether), & all look like the maker's first attempt at welding. Some of the parts are only partially welded. I'll be trying to unload it on Craig's List."
3,i prefer Chimes brand,"so i bought these to compare with a bag of Chimes brand chews that someone got me as a gift. never had a ginger chew before and i LOVED them, so i thought i'd play the field and see what other wonders could be had.for me, i didn't like these as much. they are darn good, for sure, and if i'd never had a Chimes brand version, i'm sure i'd love them. but i found the ginger flavor in Chimes more intense and great, so that remains the leader of the pack so far.to be sure, the Chimes ones are pretty darn potent, so i imagine they are not to everyone's taste."
5,Delicious,"I received a package of these in my Christmas stocking. I like Ginger a lot, but had not had anything like this before. In spite of a little hotness, they are absolutely delicious. So much concentrated flavor. If you don't like strong Ginger, you might not enjoy them quite as much. They don't bite so much if you just hold them in your mouth, but I have a hard time doing that, because I want to chew down on it and get that powerful deliciousness in my mouth. I haven't seen them in the stores here yet, but hopefully soon. Another plus is they do help with mild indigestion. Also, the hard candy Gin Gins, made by the same company, are really good and work as well as a cough drop should you need one."
1,"yuck for me, but others like it","Not my cup of tea at all. It is extremely spicey and the taste lingers. I bought it for a stomach soother because of morning sickness. I like ginger but not this, it was way too strong. I tried prego pops and drops and they have ginger in them just not as much. So if you're not a real ginger lover...aka can eat ginger straight w nothing else, try something else."
2,"HOT, HOT, HOT","I purchased these based on all of the positive reviews with the hopes of neutralizing my morning sickness. They are the spiciest, hottest things to ever defile my palate! Now I am not a big spicy food kind of gal, but my husband can devour habanero peppers like they are candy, and he tried one and was sweating. It is perhaps true that they work by distracting you from your nausea because all you can focus on suddenly is that your FACE IS ON FIRE. Be forewarned. However, they are ok melted in hot water as a tea, if you're into that kind of thing."
5,Chopmarks,Thanks to the author for this informative book. I havelooked everywhere for this information. I couldn'tput it down until I finished it. Now it is always closeby for reference.
4,Better than your average e-clash,"I bought this CD on CDbaby.com and found these reviews here. I just wanted to say my peace. This music sounds exactly like its suppose to sound- its actually better than most e-clash I've listened to. Poolwaitress reminds me of FreezePop, which is my favorite!!! If you haven't heard of them -check them out. As far as the other reviewers- I think you are missing the point- this music is right on."
1,Easy Team Trak,"Not so harsh, Team Trak. I understand your frustration with this album. I only listened to the brief downloads I got off the sight. Many of the vocals really accentuate the ""S""'s. I found that a little annoying. The lyrics did not make much sense, but with the electro beat they are going for, that really does not matter. It is a Euro sound that is best experienced while rolling on ""E"". I probably could have put together a better beat on my Casio keyboard. Given these guys are obviously amateurs, I let them slide on their debut album. A bit overpriced for their skill level. They would have better luck trying to sell their album at a head shop for $5, rather than on Amazon. Please!!! They need to work on their overall sound and beats before attempting to go Euro. Either spend time working on your skills or stick to your day job."
1,Horrible,"This has got to be the worst CD ever. I asked my parents for ""Drowning Pool"" and they got me this crap. What is up with the synthesizer? This will not sell in the U.S! How much does this cost in Euro Dollars? Maybe some freaks over there will buy it. I cannot believe my parents. They are now DNU's! I'll Trash Their Name! Code Name ""HardHat""At least I was able to use the CD case for my rolling papers!"
2,terrible print,"I just received this print in the mail. First of all the image was distorted on one side (Bert's face was not lined up/split in two uneven imagines) and second, the color was extremely faded. Not happy with this purchase at all! Please don't waste your time like I did."
3,The Brett-Guard Adventure,"This Item is as good a guard as one can find. However, one needs to be clairvoyant to mount it on ones saw. Being a machinist helps. The instructions are ludicrous. It's better to wing it.Holes need to be drilled in the saw table and threaded. I used 4 5/16 bolts. The mounting platform is not 90 degrees and needs to be. To compensate for the wobble and lack of level I installed an adjustment screw through the mount plate and into the base of the lift. Once that was accomplished the guard works well.Good luck"
2,Problems On Installation,"I received my Brett-Guard as a gift a couple years back. I just got time to install it last week. The first item i noted is that the design is flawed so that i can not install the real table plate and still tilt the saw without having themotor hit the mounting brackets (Powervmatic 64A). Nothing on-line helps. I tried the HTC web site, and their ""customer service"" email process does not work -- always gives an error message. So, i copied everything over to the 'info@affinitytool.com' email address and after a week did not get a reply. I have seen the guard in use on two different DVD, and i like the idea, but when it is impossible to install the rear plate. I sent the email again (copied sales), and maybe i will have a little more luck this time.I have some ability as a machinist, so i can probably make this work, but at this price it should arrive in working order, not as a ""home project""."
3,fits my need,This product is not bad...it fits my need but it is not as sturdy as I had hoped for. It does spin nicely but it rocks back and forth while spinning. It has not tipped over while spinning as of yet...
2,A Book?,"While it is possible to find information that I have not found in other publications, and while it is very helpful since it apparently was written by someone who has been through all this, calling it a ""book"" is just a little misleading. It has been published with a plastic spiral, no harder covers or nylon for the endsheets, there are pages to fill in that have been reprinted as many as 30 times (the journal page for example) with statements such as e ""Bare your soul"" with four lines to do it in..."
2,DOES NOT FIT 1994 TOYOTA LANDCRUISER,This product will mount to the LC and the electrical connection fits but the air chamber is the wrong diameter. Do not buy this product expecting it to fit a 1994 Land Cruiser. Rock Auto has the one that fits.
1,Where's the beef?,Lots of pictures but not much beyond how-to open the various functions. Also the CD contains almost nothing in the line of real examples. I bought this book after browsing it and expecting the CD to have a full set of work files but was sadly disappointed.If you're looking for something along the lines of the Adobe Classroom In-a-Book series then this book doesn't fall even close to being in that class.
4,"Are You a Kinesthetic Learner? If so, you'll love this book","I have found that I have a tough time with technical manuals that are primarily text... Case in point are the many MS manuals I have used for accreditation and upgrading. OK, and I'm a tad lazy too. I learn best by seeing and doing. The more senses involved, the better. When I complete a task once, I've got it. I am a huge fan of the Visual Quickstart books from Peachpit Press (I own many and recommend them as well) and have only recently come upon the Visually books. I like this book even more. Yes indeed. This book takes me through the app's new interfaces quickly and simply. It's very reasonably priced, even after converting Canadian dollars. A welcome addition to my library. Now if they only had one for Fireworks..."
4,it will SHOW you,I'm 57 and slogged through many chapters of about 8 books on this subject. THIS is the one that got me moving enough to get some things done.
3,And the List Goes On,"Cheryl Robinson delivers with Winona, a middle aged woman dealing with stresses of being a single mother of two, relocating and the pressures of family. Through coincidences and not so smooth delivery she meets Porter. A single father who at his young age is still trying to find himself and the perfect woman.Winona's whiney behavior with life in general is enough to make any reasonable person question Winona's sanity. Though she has enough on her plate which includes a deep, dark secret from her past; adding a much younger man to her upside down equation can only spell trouble.Porter's indecisiveness with whether he is a child or a man, guilty or not guilty, father or not a father has its readers on the edge of suicide.As we see toward the end there will be a sequel to these two people. Hopefully Winona and Porter can resolve their many and I emphasis the word many issues and become one."
5,Excellent reading,"I loved If it aint one thing. Not only were there several twists but it really made me think about things when dating that I had never considered before. The characters are so vivid, I can see who I want to play them in the movie. Keep up the good writing."
1,You Go Girl!,"Wowee, Woweeeeeee. What a read. You'll get plenty of pleasure from this read. The title fits perfectly with the storyline. Cause if it ain't one thing . . . it's another. Lots of drama. Definitely recommend this read."
4,Great Sounds for 2001,"This is a great CD mix of Club feel. I enjoyed Johnny Vicious' mixes more than Tall Paul's, but overall they are both on top of their game. Buy this I guarantee you'll enjoy it because it will make you feel like your in the club at 3 in the morning with your Heineken in your hand and your cigarette in the other bobbing your head and moving wildly to the mesmerizing sounds."
3,Ok,"Having heard Tall Paul live, I know that CD 2 is far from what he can come up with. But there are a few nice tracks on CD2 - 'Lectronik', 'Strange World'.Johnny Vicious is good. The first 4 tracks on CD1 are awesome. (Which you can expect if three of the four song composers are Tiesto, PvD and BT)"
4,"Rock solid, perhaps too much so.","As usual, arrived well packed, in good shape. Solidly built. Very solid. I used a couple of Carex folding canes prior to this, very lightweight. These are far heavier, much thicker aluminum. Overkill? Nice adjustments, and (surprise) decent instructions. My PT suggested forearm crutches and told me how to set them. The Medline instructions matched what she said. They are a bit hard to stuff in the car next to the seat, but good around the house. The handles are not the most comfortable, I'm looking into rubber or foam sleeves. For the price, hard to beat."
2,Not impressed,"I have had these for about six months, and they are falling apart. Where the arm cuff attaches the bolt holes have become so elongated they let the cuff flop around like a limp rag. The rubber tips wore out after only a few weeks, I replaced them with Tornado tips. The new tips are the only thing that is really good about my crutches. I don't walk a lot. I can only imagine what condition they would be in if I did walk a lot!"
4,aluminum forearm crutches satisfacory.,Crutches are just what the Dr. ordered. Price compared to DME supply was outstanding. very pleased with the cost. 2nd pair because I did manage to break one. Advise not to let the crutch get caught between gate and golf cart. Outcome not good. But crutches are satisfactory.
3,They are big!,"These have to be the sturdiest forearm crutches I have ever seen. They have very strong nuts and bolts. To me, being 5'1, they seem quite tall. They also seem heavy. I wish they were a lighter weight. the hand grips, while being quite big enough for someone with arthritis seem big for someone with small hands. I think this crutch was made for a quite larger person than myself."
5,Just what I needed,The crutches were perfect for me. They are of good quality and strong. Very happy with them.
5,crutches,I used these crutches to make canoe stabilizers like the ones I had seen on Youtube. They worked great. I wish I had found some used though; but these are unscathed from prior use else where.
1,Missing parts out of the box.,"These seem like well made crutches, but by the time they arrived I luckily no longer needed them. Unfortunately, I didn't check them over carefully right away. When I tested them today one of the plastic locking bushings was missing, so one crutch rattles loudly when used, and of course, the return window is long closed.I'd love to be able to contact someone about this, but there seem to be zero links to support for the product, and I know that no one sells parts for these crutches on this island. I'm disappointed in Amazon's product support."
3,Nice,Pretty nice. It was poorly packed when it was sent to me. the product itself is pretty nice though.
3,Could be a lot better.,"This books has some very good points regarding presentation and pictures of obscure knives from around the world, a good examination of german armed forces is a highlight, but unfortunately to me the book is quite regional (Germany and U.S.) when it could appeal to a greater range of professional users around the world, the book sometimes seems like a knife catalog (the author works at Boker's sales dept.), instead of a users guide that, in my opinion, would make the book a whole lot more ""usable"", and not only pretty a display of what is available in the aforementioned countries"
5,IT WORKS FINE!,"I bought this toy for my son 2 years ago and I just now came back to buy another one because my DOG ate the foam toppers off the snake parts. We never needed the hollow blue pieces to keep the hose on the ground and it wiggled for 2 years without a problem. Now that it is 2 years old the plastic is getting brittle from us keeping it outside in San Diego year round and the dog chewing off the foam parts but other than that it is still useable and enjoyable we just want another one we won't have to fiddle with.Trust me, I write bad reviews all the time. This toy is worth the measly $13."
1,Sai banzai to your time and $t,Purchased two.. 1st one lasted a sec.. As soon as water hit it it pooped... Cracked due to water pressure.. So either you have too little or two much pressure.. Went back and got a 2nd one... Now here is 1/2 the learning experience and educational value... 2nd time I turned water on 1/3 way and it lasted 2-3min... My son was just as upset as i was yesterday afternoon.. Educational value it was a 5 for me. I like the tip to just buy a gardening sprinkler.. I learned a lot.. Never buy crap like this. Fun value? Gave it a 2 cause I'm going to make a YouTube video with it... Might have to use some explosives.. In life you get what you pay for
1,Worthless as a sprinkler - Poorly Made - Fun Factor is 0.,"Incredibly disappointed in what Banzai thinks is a ""fun"" sprinkler with 15 wacky nozzles for spraying. I have uploaded an actual picture in the customer photos section so that you can see for yourself. Out of 15 nozzles, only about three of them spray anything worth playing in. The rest lay limp on the ground or spray maybe 6"" of water, at best. The item is poorly made and lacks the weight to keep the nozzles upright. We have tried using things (stakes and weights) to help it, but quite honestly, it just wasn't worth it. We ended up turning on the lawn sprinkler and the kids were a bit overjoyed. At any price, this is NOT worth the purchase."
1,Not worth it,"Pretty cr@ppy product. lasts for a time or two, maybe. doesn't really ""wiggle"" much or shoot too far. not worth the hassle."
2,broke after 2 uses,"I also bought this at walmart, after my kids used it twice one of the wiggly hoses came off and it wouldn't work anymore. We weren't too thrilled with it in the first place, as it's hard to get it to sit flat so the wiggly hoses move right."
1,My kids are sad. Don't waste your money.,RIP OFF. The worms don't wiggle. The other poster who said it was like a hose with some holes in it spraying water into the ground - you are correct. I wish I could return it but it isn't worth the effort. It goes in the trash.
4,Kids like it!,"Other reviews are right in saying that the end of it is lightweight so tends to flip over. However, maybe the people saying water sprays only 6"" from a few ""hoses"" don't have their water turned on high enough. If you slightly turn on the faucet, the sprinkler doesn't work the greatest. However, just by increasing the water pressure, it wiggles all over. My kids love it!"
5,Rick Steves' London 2006 (Rick Steves' London),This book was excellent. I found it very helpful in finding places and in getting background information about the places I wanted to see. I would recommend this book as one that you should purchase when Planning a trip.
4,Prairie Schooners West,"As a child I prized this book, and read it probably 9-10 times. It seems that when I was off of school for whatever reason I would gravitate to this book for entertainment. The characters are well developed and the pace is something a child can easily follow.The book describes the trials and tribulations of a group of pioneers heading west to California during the gold rush. It has historical value and I attribute this book as much as any other as a reason why I developed such a strong interest in American history."
2,Not quite what I expected,I thought this book was going to teach me how visualize but it went technical on me. I think Shakti Gawain's book is far better than this book.
1,Beware the sizes are way off,"This is a good short for active people but sizes are way off, I have purchase a number of this shorts in the past, (same brand and size but different model) when I got this on the mail realize that the size is way too big, so normally I assume that Amazon send me the wrong size but when I check the label confirm that it is my size. I don't know why or how this short could be so much bigger than all my other shorts when in fact is the same size."
4,good read.... just a few impossibilities,lots of action in this one that keeps you going. just a couple of instances of sheer incredulity but these are easily overlooked because of all the action. Look out Jack Reacher
4,An action adventure you can really sink your teeth into!,"Yes, there is a relation; I'm his daughter! :)This book starts of a serious of wonderfully exciting and enjoyable books. It'll make you laugh. But most of all, you'll be hungry for more.For those action adventure types, this will be one you can't put down. You'll be asking ""when's the next one due?"""
5,"What goes around comes around, and payback is a -----","What happens when a gorgeous Irish jewel thief and a hardened American mercenary are double-crossed by the same employer and then join forces? Austin Camacho's The Payback Assignment is a 230-page answer to that question, and a very fun and satisfying answer at that. The story line runs at a nice pace from caper to caper, from danger to danger, or from firefight to firefight, until the reader is running right alongside the characters. And best of all, there is a wee bit of the paranormal included. With an ending that could segue perfectly into a second book, one can only hope this is the kick-off for a new series!"
4,The Payback Assignment - A Cool Read,The Payback Assignment is a fun read. The characters are well developed especially the main two characters. The main bad guy enough so you don't like him. The plot is just that: a payback for what was done to the two heros but with interesting twists and turns. Interaction between the heros has some very unexpected scenes. I enjoyed this novel and recommend it as a different kind of action adventure.
4,A Fun and Exciting Read,"I enjoyed The Payback Assignment. There was lots of action, which I enjoy in a book. I liked the main characters, but they were perhaps a little too wonderful and their actions required more than just a little suspension of belief. In spite of that, this is a good story, it was fun and I will read another."
1,There is a better book available,"In addition to this book, I also bought ""Standards for Online Communication,"" (SFOC) by J. Hackos & D. Stevens. As of this writing, I've read much of both books. Is the Help Helpful? seems to have taken it's material from SFOC. SFOC is more thorough and therefore easier (for me) to understand. If you are creating online help, go with SFOC."
4,Refreshing,"As a yogini I find it refreshing, to learn about the experiences of other women who travel the same path. This read gave me a motivational boost."
2,disappointed,What a disappointment. Many more eloquent writers could have done much better with this exciting idea. The style of this book made each story feel like a cliff note. Incomplete. It cheapened and took away from these lovely women that were the subject of this book. The author might do best sticking to writing articles and leave writing books to someone that is able to develop and cultivate each story.I'm sorry to have paid such a price for this magazine!Yoga girl
3,Not the best pack around,"If you run a spellcaster deck, buy the good cards individually because in my opinion, I rarely get good cards out of this booster."
4,Magician Power !!!!!,~~~EDUCATION VALUE~~~MAKE FRIENDSUSE YOUR BRAIN TO THINKHAVE FUNADD AND SUBTRACT~~~DURABILIY~~~THEY CAN GET DAMAGED EASILYGET SLEEVES AND A DECK BOX~~~THE CARDS~~~THIS PACK INTROPDUCES US TOUNION MONSTERS - WHEN YOU CONNECT THEM TOGETHER THEY GET STRONGER AND NEW EFFECTSSPEELCASTERS - CARDS THAT GO WELL WITH DARK MAGICIAN AND OTHER SPELLCASTERS
5,Awesome,I just bought this at toywiz.com. Since toysrus doesn't sell a box of magicians force. And I'm hoping that I would get Dark Magician girl. But I haven't got the box yet. To make it short get this booster. You will get Machines and magicians. Your deck will be awesome.
2,High hopes,"I waited 4 months for this radio, it looked wonderfull, but looks can be decieving. The raido fit right where I wanted it to go. But when I started using it problems became apparent. The controls were hard to use. The squelch and volume are on one stalk control and are hard to set with out moving each other at the same time. There is no noise blanking system. The squelch circuit is very quick to open therefor letting in a lot of impulse noise that would not be let though on other radios. Then the last straw, the latches holding the removable face plate broke! They were made out of PLASTIC! The radio is going back!"
3,Buyers and Sellers be ware.,"Apparently some retailers are confused by the wrong picture. The CD with ""MACROSS PLUS"" plastered across the triangle logo thing, is ""The Original sound track Vol.1"", NOT ""The Cream P.U.F."". They are not the same thing!""Steve S."" and I uploaded the correct album pictures. Pleas refer to them before listing any product you think might be ""The Cream P.U.F."".Thanks to a confused seller here, and quick service elsewhere. I now have both CDs.I got this CD ""The Cream P.U.F."" for the track ""Information High"", Witch is NOT on ""The Original sound track Vol.1"".""The Cream P.U.F."" is a good album, if you can find the correct CD.""O"" and a track list of the 4 tracks are, that's four tracks NOT eleven;1 [8:04] Information High2 [5:40] Idol Talk3 [5:16] The Borderline4 [7:10] SANTI-U"
4,An enjoyable autobiograhpy with lots of rich history.,I came across Howard Teeple when I was researching my Teeple family history. We immediately discovered that we are cousins. Howard suggested that I read his book to answer my questions.I found it extremely valuable in learning about my Teeple ancestry. Howard's years of research really show. I very much enjoyed reading about his experiences and insights.
4,Good....If you like this sort of thing,"This will probably not appeal to too many. You have to actually like the 1960s version of ""Big Band"". If you do like that sort of thing, you will probably like this.There is much reason to compare this to some of Herb Alpert and the TJB type of music. It has a bit less flavor and used a bigger band but it is the same sort of instrumental romp, heavy on brass, which features simple but catchy tunes.These guys are not as good as the TJB and the quality of the recordings (One is even Mono!) is not as high as that of Herb Alpert but it is still an enjoyable session."
3,Good,"Bob Crewe was involved in the Dynovoice label in the 1960s, home of bands like The Toys (""Lovers Concerto,"") and Eddie Rambeau (""Concrete And Clay."")Music To Watch Girls By is Crew and an orchestra covering these and many other 1960s hits--""Winchester Cathedral,"" ""Theme From A Man And A Women,""What could have been really bad is pretty good. This album is not rock, but if you can imagine how Herb Alpert and the Tjuana Brass would have treated this music, Crewe is not far off. If this is easy listening, it is easy listening you can swing to.Makes great beds for on the air DJs. Need more? Check out the Dynovoice compilationBob Crewe Presents The DynoVoice Story - The Label That Had to Happen"
2,Prince Hours,"I was a lil bit disappointed watching this drama. It wasnt as good as the first one..Princess Hours. Acting and storyline was okay although Seven is cute. Overall, i wont recommend this drama unless u like the actor Seven. The one i got has horrible English subtitles too."
3,# 2 of The Bedegrayne Series,"Wynne has decided she doesn't need to marry and would rather help out the less fortune. While try to help a young girl who her father plans for sell she is attacked. Keanan Milroy (born on wrong side of the blanket) a prize fighter saves Wynne and finds himself attracted to her. Lots of great twist and turns.Check out the whole The Bedegrayne Series; A Lady's Mischief (1), A Gentleman At Heart (2),Tempting The Heiress (3) and Courting The Countess (4)."
2,almost good,"Seems like it will protect an iPod nano from dings and dirt. However product is bulky and seems a bit like too much cheap plastic. External scroll wheel/knob is very erratic; moves jerkily through menus and sub-menus, and I could not get it to adjust volume while a song was playing. Unfortunately I'll be returning it and resuming my hunt for a better case/armband."
4,Great case for outdoor work/play,"I work in landscaping and spend 10+ hours a day outside. After dropping my nano a couple of times I figured it was time to find a suitable case for it.The H2O case is very well built, solid design using thick plastic. The controls work fine (the touch wheel control requires a tiny amount of pressure) and the case seals well against dust and debris. The arm band works great and keeps the nano controls from accidentally being pressed.The case might be a bit bulky for those wanting a case for general purpose. But, for those that exercise or work outdoors I find the case is the right size as the added bulk makes the nano easier to hold and less likely to be dropped."

5,Great book to own,This is such a great book. It takes me back to when I meet the love of my life. It also show how family is important.
1,An absolutely abysmal piece of trash.,"This is one of the most over rated ""books"" of modern times. It deserves no more than to have the pages ripped out and put in the bottom of a hamster cage. It has no real plot and no literary value. It is the written equivalent of the ""art"" exhibit ""Sensations."" It was written for one reason and one reason only, to shock. Were it written by anyone but a black woman it would not been published, must less sold even one copy."
1,the item says small but they are the giant size which my dogcannot eat.,this was not what I ordered. I am most upset- I gave the giant size treats to a neighbor with a large dog. the package says small but they are huge. Very disappointed. I will not order from you again.
2,Yawn.....,So boring... I honestly buy these things so I can fall asleep while watching. This one was an excellent sleep aid.
1,Employment for human resource practice,This book has a new version. Amazon shouldnt put this in the market anymore. I bought it and it is a hassle for me to send back to Amazon. In short i am struck with the old version!
3,Indifferent,"I never actually had a chance to read it. My professor told us we would not be using it for class, so I sold it before I ever flipped through it."
2,horribly dated,"As this book was written in 1999, it is horribly dated for issues concerning living in France today. In addition, its analysis of racial issues in France is overly simplistic. Do not recommend."
4,good shuttlecocks,The service is good. I got this item on time. The best thing is that this shuttlecocks are really good. It's tough and lasts longer
4,Provides a well-balanced overview of ethical theory.,Pojman takes a variety of selections from opposing viewpoints to create a well-balanced text that serves as an excellent resource for an introductory philosophy or ethics class. Includes sources from early classical philosophers to contemporary authors.
4,What more can I say? It's just a textbook.,"I didn't buy it out of pleasure. I needed it for a class. Yet, it did come in a very timely matter and in awesome condition; better than the condition the books in my college's bookstore come in looking. So overall this is a pretty good product from a really awesome online store."
2,Not a great fit,"I purchased this for my husbands 1996 chevy c1500. As he installed them, both broke on various corners. He was not rough with them at all, so it was not because of being careless. The taillights are also not a proper fit,there is a gap. I checked before buying, that these would fit his vehicle and was assured they would. Because of all this, I dont recommend them."
4,Question before buying?,"When purchasing, how many tail lights are suppose to come in the package?One tail light or the pair?"
1,"Corded phone great, but cordless.....STINKS!!!!!","I purchased this phone with the accessory handsets--three of them to be exact and I've had the same problem with all of the handsets...none of them can retain a charge. One phone will hold for about 10 minutes and the other phones will die after only 2 minutes of use! Of course, this happened after the approved return period, so now I am stuck with these phones that do not work.Do not buy this phone under any circumstances. If it was just one of the cordless phones, I would have thought it was just a defective battery, but all three of the cordless phones are having the same problem which makes me think that it's a manufacturing problem.The corded telephone with the answering machine work great, but if you are in the market for an expandable system, then this is not the phone system for you."
2,The photo lies..alot.,"Okay, so the girl wearing it makes it look like it's going to be a beauty piece in person...wrong.It feels almost wiry..very stiff.I bought the Small, and it fit like a medium.So, I was stuck with a cheap, ill-fitting nightie I can't wear.I also thought from the photo it had underwire - but no.The boobs on it look horrid on with no support.I gave it two stars for trying."
4,O.o,"22:27 there's a random stryker in the background. After being in a stryker unit, i can say there should in no way be more HMMWV's than strykers there, but you know now I'm just nitpicking. Overall it was pretty good so far, except for the cliche ""man in coma (or defenseless zombie snack) wakes up from coma and wonders what's going on. I know it's a show and all, but this dude woulda been a zombie lunch long before he awoke."
5,"The walking dead, Season 1 episode 1 and 2","Really I thought it played out very well, ""both episodes"". I was suprised, I didnt expect a zombie flick it to be as good as it really is. now im addicted to it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time and leaves you wanting more. Its grusome and raw, and I hope theres going to be a season 2. Their really going to have to scratch their heads to keep come up with ideas on this one. I enjoy how they are making the viewer have mixed feelings about the cops friend and his wife. Me personally I would want to know why they didnt come check on him in the hospital...and hes screwing his wife. I hope they both get bit. I did feel sorry for the horse though. :)"
5,Love The Walking Dead,Came on time and in good condition. I feel that it was fairly priced and I love the Walking Dead comic books and tv show. I would recommend seeing both of them (they have different story lines).
4,"Simple pack, great content","I bought it as fast I could, when special edition wasn't avaliable.Blue Ray Disc 1 includes all 6 episodes + extra content. The seoncd one is also a blu ray and has bonus content. Only the episodes has spanish subtitles, extras doesn't. That's why I gave it 4 stars.Right now, for the price, you can buy the special edition wich includes a 3rd bluray disc. Even so, this is a great version."
4,Was a gift / I don't judge,It was a gift for Christmas / I'm sure he was delighted; shipping was fast and the conditionwas excellent.
2,Good for one play,"I liked this game for one time through, but it doesn't continue. You reach a point where it has to start over, and the scenario does not change. Glad it was free, so I didn't feel bad deleting it!"
5,Good deal,"I got the first season for a friend for christmas and she loved it. I've never seen the show, but she seems to love it."
3,It's OK but I wouldn't watch Season 2.,Falling Skies is much better. It's just walking dead people. Over and over and over. 'Sorry I paid for it.
4,"Good show, fuzzy quality!","If you like zombie stuff, you will probably like this show. I hate when people try being movie reviewers! The show is good, but this is the first Blu-ray that I have bought and seemed fuzzy. Blu-rays are supposed to be crystal clear, which is the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars. Don't get me wrong! It is still worth getting!"
4,it's like the comic and very good but way too short for a series.,"This show is well made and engaging, it's only problem is that it only has six epispodes so it's like a british tv series. (many are only that long each season). But it doesn't stay very faithful to the spirit of the 'the walking dead' comic series and that's why it's very good. The acting is excellent too and the effects are outstanding, the show and comics borrowed from many zombie movies particularily Romeros classics but that's ok too. This is high budget tv and it's got good stories and it's only the second tv series featuring zombies ever. The first was the outrageous ""dead air' from the uk , which skewered 'big brother' and the desire for instand fame. I recommend that one too and this one looks great on blu ray. If you want to own this blu ray is the only way to go."
4,I hate this guy,The show so far is good but the main guy is pissing me off. I have a hard time believing he is a cop being as how slow he is to react to everything! He also seems to forget that there are millions of dead people walking around when he goes up to a house and asks for some gas like someone would just be sitting on the porch having some lemon aid!
2,Show good; unbox BAD,"The show was great.Unfortunately I didn't get to watch it for over a week after I ordered it. I tried to download it onto my netbook, a couple days before a trip. Unbox used 100% of the CPU and ran for two days and still failed to download a single, complete episode. I tried to continue in the airport(s) but not only did it not make progress, but it started back from the beginning! I will not be ordering any more digital video content from amazon for a long time. Hopefully if I give it a year or two Amazon will improve their downloader/DRM manager to something even slightly usable."
3,Too little for too much.,"Compared to other popular sci-fi TV shows, $30 for six episodes is too much:Farscape: The entire series - $67 for four seasonsBuffy the Vampire Slayer - 122 hours for about $140Lost: Complete Series on Blu-Ray - 84 hours for $180Too bad, the show is a lot of fun -- albeit maybe a little longwinded at times."
1,"Great Show, Nasty DRM","The Good:This is an excellent series, a must watch. Even if you are not into zombie flicks. It may sound odd to some, but the personality story lines reminds me of Twelve Angry Men.The Bad:Normally I rip my own Blu-rays but I figured I'd give the digital download a shot since Amazon's MP3 store has been so good in regards to the digital market. Big mistake. I have my library cataloged using a Plex server. I downloaded these only to discover that they are DRM'd so that if you try to access them via a personal media server it crashes the server and client applications. This is lame and should be disclosed more readily; I'm sure if you read the fine print some where along the line it'll say as much.So bottom line is if you are a media junkie just buy the Blu-Ray hard copy and rip it. Commercial digital video downloads, even on Amazon, are still a hassle in many ways which is unfortunate."
2,AMAZING SHOW! But is the DVD worth it?,"the first season only has 6 episodes. at the time of ths writing, there are only minimal special features. so let me break this down.6 amazing, amazing, 1 hour episodes (90 minutes for the first episode) for 40 dollars, brought down to 28 (lets say 30) dollars through Amazons price-drop.thats roughly 5 dollars an episode. is 5 dollars worth one hour for you? not even a full 60 minutes; its 40 minutes, 5 dollars.I'll wait until a severe price drop before I pick this up, I refuse to pay for more than I receive.just to let you know, the 2 stars isnt for the show. the show deserves 10 stars, hands down. I'm only rating the product that AMC seriously needs to reconsider prices for."
2,"Great Show, but only 6 Episodes? Really?","I really enjoyed following the story, but can't help but feel a little ripped off being charged so much money for only 6 episodes. If anything, AMC should include some fun stuff with the series. Maybe a map of everywhere the story as taken place thus far? Fake blood? A working crossbow would be awesome and totally worth it but for now I'll wait til Season 2 comes out (unfortunately it is slated to come out Oct 2011...)."
1,"Some what OK, but far from great..","I have seen more zombie movies than I would like to admit. Very few of them has been any good, in fact I can not remember a good one since the movie ""28 days later"". I had hoped this serie ""Walking dead"" would be good, but it is really not any good. There is not enough action, and I get the same sence of the show as when I started to watch ""Lost"". Short and sweat, it is not interesting enough, poor actors, sad special effects, horrible storie etc, etc.If you are looking for a zombie movie, or ""the world is going to hell"", I recommend you buy these movies:28 Days laterDawn of the deadStephen King's - The StandI have seen the complete first season, and there is nothing at the end even teasing me to look into season II..."
5,Walking Dead Marathon!!,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!! Originally watched the series on Netflix and this was instantly worthy of being added to my movie collection. The Series is Fantastic and I love the B/W version (something about zombies in b/w rocks). The DVD extras give a great inside look behind the scenes and the story of where this Zombie Apocolypse came from. This is a must have for any zombie lover!!"
5,Instant Zombie Classic,"Ok, Im an admitted gore hound zombie classicist. Outside of Romero's film, Dead Snow, and James Gunn's classic remake of Dawn of the Dead, I usually end up panning all zombie fare. The Walking Dead has it all!! Great characters, great action, great zombies and a storyline that just won't quit. The pandemic is and its details are kept in the bag, which is nice for now and the evil characters make the zombies look good which is a nice clever aspect of the series. The acting could be stronger in spots but overall the main characters are very solid. As a reader only a few Z novels make the cut on this level of entertainment: Max Brooks, WORLD WAR Z, MONSTER ISLAND and a great new one i just discovered called BLUE BLOODBATH by Katrina Von Kessel...I hope the producers who did Walking Dead have something to do with Brad Pitts WWZ...they know what they're doing!!!"
2,Predictable and cliche,"I really want to like this, but it's just like '28 Days' mixed with others, but stretched longer. The most characters aren't really convincing nor some of the logics in behaviors/plots."
5,Where to start...,"What else can really be said that already hasn't been?TWD, put simply, is by far one of the best episode shows ever put on screen.the actingthe camera workthe zombies!the storylinesthe zombies!The Walking Dead is gold medal material.In my estimation, there's little that can be done to improve on it.We should all just be glad the makers of this thing made it all happen.I'll be putting in my order here on Amazon.com in the next few days for TWD season2.If you like not only zombies, but real life situations, reactions and results of what the living would do in this apocalypse, buy The Walking Dead NOW.You won't be disappointed. It's that good."
4,Walking Slow....,Seems that the mailing process was slow but we love the videos. They arrived safe and unharmed. Other than that I would do business with them again.
5,Not your average Zombie movie,"The Walking Dead goes above and beyond the standard zombie genre of the blood-thirsty undead feasting on the terrified living. What we have here is a fascinating insight into the interpersonal relations between a ragtag band of survivors that borders on an anthropological study that would have made Margaret Mead proud. Yes, The Walking Dead gives us some of the best undead special effects and terror that I have seen since the classic remake of Dawn on the Dead, but the main focus of the series zones in on how the human animal acts and reacts when taken out of his/her comfort zone. Unlikely heroes rise to the occasion alongside standard villains.My only gripe? Not enough Lennie James! I hope Morgan and his son, Duane, turn up in season 2."
5,Awesome,I bought this show for my sis and her boyfriend they love it thanks guys. The show is amazing and its better on blu-ray thanks once again and i would definitely buy from you guys again.
5,Great Zombie intro.,"I must admit, I watched this series not having much experience in the zombie genre beyond Michael Jackson's Thriller video. I found it to be really well written with a great cast that delivers a believable performance. While I'd not been a zombie fan in the past, I have long been interested in end-of-the-world and catastrophic themes. The idea of a super bug taking out the majority of the population is not a new idea but adding the zombie twist was new for me. I found the first season of The Walking Dead to be entertaining and far too short at just six episodes. Loved it."
4,Good Show - DVD lacking in special features,"First of all, I love all things zombie so I'm biased towards liking this show.The DVD was lacking in the special features to me. I would have liked to see something involving the different characters or maybe mini-episodes.I still recommend this show to anyone."
5,Easily the best horror based television show in the past 10yrs.,"The characters are good, the plot is better, and the production value and special effects are top notch! Even my wife enjoys it and she doesn't like gore."
5,Zombies,Cant get enough of this show; first season is a little short but only because it was a test to see how much market they could get.
2,"bad streaming experience, wish it's in netflix","I know my at&t connection is fine but the streaming video is bad, it skips and stalls. This doesn't happen in my netflix account. The content is good though, amazon just blew it off."
2,So so zombie show,"Walking dead is a combination of B-grade zombie movie, the tv show Survivor and the tv show Lost. It is very slow paced and lacks tension for most of the episodes. The acting involves too much acting and there are not enough zombies. The main characters sit around and mope far too much as they apparently wait for the studio to hire a semi-competent writer who could liven things up. The pacing is pretty much exactly the same on Survivor.It feels entirely contrived."
1,"The Walking dead ""season 1 full disc set""","This DVD set was advertised as a FULL SEASON 1 set, and lo and behold, when we go to watch it, it's only got the first 6 episodes. It's ridiculous that it is advertised as a full series."
1,High hopes dashed,"Lackluster,wooden acting,and the last episode was like a mission in Resident Evil.(I was waitting for Tyrant to brake though the wall)I had been a fan of the comic since jump and looked forward to the show.Letdown more so than Watchmen and V for Vendetta.Let me make a suggestion(Hollyturd will ignore it) No more comic book,video game,or zombie films for 10yrs.Face its all becoming recyled."
3,"Fun to watch, but overly melodramatic and...","...holes big enough in the plot and logic you can drive a truckload of zombies through.1. If blood in the eyes/cuts, etc. can turn you, why does the goofball with the crossbow continue to wipe arrows (target arrows by the way) off on his pants time and time again? And why does the sister continue to hold her dead, BLOODY, sister, with blood all over her face, arms and clothing? Is she immune?2. If they need transportation, why not grab one or two of the thousands stranded on the roadways? Are they price-shopping for a better deal?3. Why do they have to be in or near Atlanta? Why not move away, far into the country, away from once populated areas? Or maybe Barstow...nobody goes there unless they have to.4. Why did the other doofus cut off his hand instead of cutting through the rusted pipe he was cuffed to? (Then again, he isn't exactly a brain surgeon.)5. Etc."
2,Not Much Like The Comic,"I read the Compendium (Issues #1-#48) a while back, and this show strays pretty far from it. The main actor is a horrible choice too. Most of the others that weren't made up and were in the comics are good choices though. Even though the zombies look really good, nothing else does. Planning on downloading this from Amazon? The video quality is atrocious for the ""HD"" version. iTunes is probably a better bet, or if you must see it, just wait for the BD to come out. I'm very disappointed in how this show turned out since Robert Kirkman had such a big roll in making it."
2,What Hype?,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this show. Our main character wakes up from a gun shot wound to find that the planet has been taken over by zombies. He was a police officer and he quickly goes back to trying to get order in his life, in particular finding his wife and son (who happen to be not that far away, in the woods, hunkered down with his best friend).There is/was a lot of hype around this show and I'm not sure why. The characters aren't that strong and the writing is okay."
3,"Great Show, overpriced set","This show is great, probably one of the best in the zombie genre to even rival Romero. However, this set is not needed. 6 episode and call it a volume? Someone has been taking their cues from the family guy folks."
3,Overpriced for six episodes,i love this series; but i only gave it three stars because they have the nerve to ask 27 bucks for 6 episodes? seriously? that is nuts!
2,6 episodes is a season?,"I love this show and will continue to watch it. I will also recommend it to my friends, but is 6 episodes really a whole season? Get real! I would expect at least twice as mamy episodes and probably 16 to make a whole season."
5,Thrilling!,"Got hooked on this show,when I watched it with my son. Very exciting and chilling.Highly recommended series to watch. Great cliffhangers."
5,Nice to have,"LOVE this show. My dvr died and I lost all my pre-recorded shows. Then to top it off, dish dropped AMC... so I turned to Amazon and was so very happy they were showing The Walking Dead the day after it shows on TV. Dish ended up putting AMC back on after the 3rd episode of the season aired and I ended my subscription to The Walking Dead but I can honestly say that the quality of the show was good (I used my google tv to log in to amazon and stream it onto my tv) and I will be using Amazon again to watch my shows when traveling or if dish pulls another stunt."
4,4.5 Stars but Amazon doesn't let you do half stars,I heard about The Walking Dead series back when the San Diego Comic Con was going on and AMC had released a trailer. I was blow away this seemed like a drama with zombies. When I watched the first show I was not disappointed it had drama and zombies and it did not try to over whelm you with either. I just had a problem with a couple of scenes that it why I thought it was 4.5 stars and not 5. I won't mention the scenes to keep spoilers out of the review but lets just say that I could not suspend my disbelieve for those two scenes. If you like your zombie shows with some drama and good acting and action then The Walking Dead is for you.
5,"Great story, even for non-zombie fans","I was not a fan of zombie movies before this show, but I tuned in because a friend told me it was very good. I found it to be among the best TV shows currently. It was not the usual blood, gore, and screams zombie fest. While it does have its share of that, it also turns out to be first & foremost, a well-told story about very human characters, with all their failings & heroism, showing both the good & the bad in them. And it is dealt with in a realistic fashion, with the characters making decisions that let them survive, or making wrong decisions that get them killed, without any miraculous ""saves"" that we don't get in real life. It is on-the-edge of your seat suspenseful, keeps me coming back & wanting more. Can't wait for the new seasons! If you like a good story about very human characters, even if you don't like zombies normally, you'll probably like this!"
3,Still catching up . . .,"Streamed Season 1 and about halfway through Season 2 now. Kinda liking it all right. Wuteva. ABC cancelled All My Children and Desperate Housewives, so I have to watch something. Sure hope SLORE-EE has that baby so it can get bit, then come back zombie-fied & bite her while she's nursing."
2,poor quality,"The quality of The walking dead was very poor. I highly advise anyone interested in this product to order the DVD's and ignore the digital DL. I had the DL playing at 720, and it looked like 480. Because of this experience I will not waste my money on an Amazon digital DL, for a few years at-least.My cable connection, is Cable, 1.5m up and 3m down..... with speed burst up to 10m down."
5,you gotta love the walking dead,Watched it for FREE on amazon. Thought it was great! (which was a surprise) somebody put some thought into this production. can't wait for the second season!
5,"Don't Walk, Run!","The product arrived in perfect condition with not a smudge on the discs. I was impressed with how quickly it arrived.Now onto the series: Wonderful! The makeup of the Walkers was very realistic and the special effects are seamless. You really feel close to the action. The story is mostly character progressive, though there are a few instances when the Walkers are the ones who spur them into action. It follows the survivors as they try to live in this new world with no information as to why the situation occurred, and there are always consequences to their choices. For anyone who loves those good old zombie flicks, this series is for you."
4,"Excellent show, Great Bluray","This a great show, even tough it's only 6 episodes long, this TV series about Zombies it's a guilty pleasure for any zombie-genre fan, Based on the comic book of the same name (which I haven't read by the way) 'The Walking Dead' is more character-based than zombie-based which is not a flaw at all, we get enough zombies, and some of them are awesome looking. The Quality of the Bluray is pretty good, tough don't be expecting the kind of quality that series such as Lost has to offer, I gave the picture quality 4 stars, could've been better, the show itself is five stars, and the Bluray itself has many interesting bonus features worth the purchase: making of the series, making of every episode, make-up and effects bits, etc. if you are a zombie geek, you should own this."
5,One of the best shows on TV,Love this series. It's different enough from the comic that if you have read the comics you won't lose interest or know what's coming next.
5,Awesome show,"Addicting show even if you are not in to this type of show, which I didn't think I was you will enjoy the characters and their relationships, zombies are just a part of it."
4,Gory but Good,"I wasn't sure I'd like this series, because it is really gory. There is enough drama, and the actors are really good to get me past the extreme violence, and now I'm hooked."
5,Zombie Christmas,"My son began watching this series just this year and has seen all of season 2 and 3 but only part of season one. I bought this so he could be all caught up as it quickly became his favorite show. This shipped quickly, came fully sealed and in store-bought condition. My kiddo will be very happy to get this!"
4,Wow!,This is a must see show! It has you thinking and putting yourself in the characters shoes all through out. Kept me at the edge of my seat all the time.
4,"gory, violent and fun to watch",Turned onto this series by my nephews. Loved it and proceeded to buy Season II. Now if I could just find the time to watch it!
5,Another amazing series.,"Zombie fans, I can't tell you how much you need this to be a part of your collection. AMC really out did themselves with this hit series. I have watched every episode glued on for that sole hour. It is mind blowing, gut wrenching, and nerve wracking. Zombies are so life like it makes you wonder (Do you have what it takes to survive a Zombie Apocalypse?)"
5,Great series,"Being a fan of the comic books series, I was not disappointed by this TV series. I am in fact very intrigued by the way they are making this TV series diverting from the original story."
5,Great series,"The series downloaded fast, had great quality, all the shows streamed flawessly on iPad. I definitely recommend this series to download."
5,I am The Watching Dead,"All i need to saw Is WOW love it the black and white episode was the best, wish they would do this for season 2 and 3"
5,New addiction,"I was hesitant to watch zombie movies and do not watch while eating, but I love this show! I totally want to be an extra as a zombie."
4,The Walking Dead Season 1 (HD),"What can I say, I'm guilty of loving Sci-Fi. This first season is good, but not great. Most of the scenes pretty cool. I have to admit if I where alone at night watching this I would jump and run for the people several times. HD is great, I'm hooked. Thanks Amazon for a good watch and season."
5,this is how to do it RIGHT,"Most sci-fi and horror movies/TV series are done so poorly that when one is actually done well, it is a matter wothy of note. Most are written poorly. The acting is bad. They are cheaply and quickly done with little thought or worthwhile content. They are made badly from start to finish and they are completly forgettable.The Walking Dead has been a welcome departure from this formulaic mediocrity. The writing is crisp and it flows fast. The actors and actresses are taking their craft seriously. It is supurbly well directed. What they have done is set out to make a quality product and they have hit a home run.The Walking Dead set ratings records. They did it by creating a quality product and approaching their subject matter seriously.This should be an object lesson to other production companies: if you make it well, they will come. They will reward you at the box office and clammor for season 2."
4,I'm just so pleased the dead are out walking the streets.,"I can't give this 5 stars because I think some of the acting is a little sketchy, but I like the series a lot so far.It has an appropriately charged atmosphere for the genre and the pacing is just right. Some reviewers complainthat there's not enough zombie-killing. The gaming audience is hard to please, but the paucity of graphic violence adds to theshocking brutality of the action scenes when they do turn violent and it would be a short-lived series if the focus wason mere gore instead of the interpersonal experiences of the survivors. The makeup and special effects are great andthe series seems to be pretty well written so far. These are hard characters for the actors because they have to projectthe serious tension of the situation believably without appearing stiff or maudlin. The director is letting the actors bea bit lazy in places but this is a really fun show even if you don't like zombies."
4,very good!,"Such an awesome show! Was not expecting it to be as good as it was my only gripe is that its only 6 episodes in the first season, but it deffeniantly makes up for that in other departments. Can't wait for the next season! Well worth the money!"
3,"twd, the complete first season","omg, i couldn't wait to get the dvd and there was a scene missing!!!! It is NOT complete!!! Isn't that false advertising?! The scene were they dragged the walker in so they could chop him up and spread the blood and guts on them so they could walk among the dead and not be noticed on the way to get the construction van. I feel cheated!!!"
5,Best of the Zombie Genre Ever Made!,"While I am not a huge fan of the Zombie genre, I do own a considerable amount of Dvd's about the brain eaters. This to me has to be the best of them all. There is more to The Walking Dead than your usual zombie movie. It's not just about the survival of the living, but there is a plot with sub-plots as well. The stories are character driven instead of the usual bloody fanfare. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of blood and gore for those seeking that as well. I won't give any spoilers, so all I am going to say is that if you like a good story no let me correct that, if you like a great story then this is for you. The quality alone is more than you would expect from a TV show. More, the actors are unknown but top-notch and sure to be seen in future endeavors just for their acting in this series. My only complaint, is that there are only 6 episodes. I truly found myself wanting more at the end of the six episodes. Season two should give us all that.Ralph."
4,Grain pattern limits enjoyment on blu-ray,"Series is great; I loved watching it in HD on TMC. However there's a grain pattern on many shots on the blu-ray that was not there on the HD broadcast. Think the 1000 pattern pixel blinks, that resemble mosquitoes on the 300 blu-ray. Not nearly as distracting as the 300 release and it's only on some shots, but is this what we were promised for HD releases?"
5,Okay Yes i did the Double Dip!!!,"So okay, I've been reading about the ""double dipping"" and yes I kind of been resisting purchasing this 3 disk special edition, because I already had the original season 1 DVD set. But when I finally have in I bought the Special Edition & gave my original season 1to my nephew, who of course is a fellow Walking Dead fan fanatic!So, now that I have the Season 1 Special Edition I absolutely enjoyed the addition of the 3rd disk, and really didn't mind spending the $$.$$ for it. The extras in the 3rd disk were really entertaining & informative to only the serious Walking Dead Freak-A-Zoids!!! But what I absolutely really liked was the Black & White version of the season 1 Pilot Show! That from my POV was much better the the colored version that we all saw on AMC! So this 3 disk season 1 special edition dose deserve the 5 stars I gave it! Simply because ""I liked it!"" and no my name isn't Mikey!!! Robert Kirkman & The Walking Dead Kicks @$$"
3,"Great series, bad transfer","Well I love the series, but the transfer of the blu-ray quality blows... it's all staticy.. I watch it on netflix and it's clear in HD..."
4,great show,"Well I was originally not wanting to watch this show until a friend of mine said to give it a chance and I am glad that I did, love this program cant wait to own season 3"
5,best series ever,I didn't start watching until season 2. When that was over there was no question that I had to get the first season for the background...such a good decision. I LOVE this dang show!!! Great shipping time and condition as expected. Thank you!!!
5,Great Series Starter,"This was a great opener for the rest of the series. It introduced the characters very well! Although some parts were a little gory and there was some mature content, it was still a great story and didn't distract the audience from the show."
5,Love the undead!!,"This show is amazing!!! And falls in the same category as resident evil, 28 days/weeks later, and Zombies!!! It's intense, scary, and GORY and GRUESOME!!!! Love it!!!!"
5,Best show ever,"Greatest show in the world. AMC shows another show that is worth watching, if you havent seen it yet i'd order this right now."
4,The show is really good but....,"I downloaded the 1st season to my computer and would like to watch it on my LCD TV, but I can't figure out how. I put the shows on a external HD and plugged it into my TV by way of HDMI, it plays all scrambled. I have no problem watching it on my computer, it plays very crisp and clear with the Amazon unbox player. Am I not able to watch this on my TV? can any one help?"
3,"crappy acting, decent gore, nothing great","Basically I thought it'd be better , never read the comics , but once you've seen all of george romeros zombie saga everything else just pales in comparison. It did look to have some promise after seeing the first episode which is the only episode directed by frank darabont , but after that it just got cheesy , with cheesy unrealistic dialougue and some episodes were just borefests, regardless its nice to see something like this on tv there aren't many gory horror series basically none - amc is trying something new which is good / check out Breaking Bad , amc's best series on TV"
1,"Weak, weak, weak","The show started fresh, but quickly sizzled. The concept had a lot of potential, but it's filled with too many plain dumb interpersonal relationship dramas. It's like a soap opera with minor zombie scenes."
1,This sucks....,"How is this thing getting so many good reviews? - It's basically a predictable and uninteresting extended version of Resident Evil, just without any of the fun high tech stuff. Running around the southern countryside randomly stumbling into zombies....really? Plus you know exactly whats gonna happen, no surprise, no anything. The characters are soo forgettable, bland without any deep personality...was actually rooting for the zombies to eat them to put this mediocre series out of its misery - ugh, so bad, CSPAN is more exciting....STAY AWAY!!"
1,Not Worth Watching,"I didn't imagine it possible, but AMC has turned a post apocalyptic zombie thriller into a boring soap opera. The silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous, and drag on, and on. With very sparse sprinkles of zombie action, this show has become a dud."
1,Beware. Bait and switch,I ordered this and didn't receive the 3 disc special edition blu ray. I received the regular version. I complained and returned it. I reordered the 3 disc special edition and again got the regular version. This was a gift for a friend so I ended up just giving it away anyway but it's thoroughly irritating.
5,I'm Hooked,"I heard my colleagues at work talking about this every week and I thought ""meh!, zombies, not my cup of tea"" Here I am having watched the whole 1st season! Love it!"
4,The Walking Dead,"Love the series...got the blu rays in 2 days...only reason i dont give it 5 stars is cause i wish the studio made it in 4 pack blu ray including 3d,dvd,digital copies."
5,In love with this series :)),"This is now my very favorite zombie show bar none! Better than most if not all zombie movies (gasp!) So incredibly impressed with the tone of the series, the actors are amazing, the human story is awesome, & it just keeps me wanting more. Looking for campy or one liners? This is not for you! People making wisecracks during this series irritate me ;-PBonus features, behind the scenes stuff is just awesome for zombie fans too!"
5,AWESOME,Who doesn't like the most watched show on Television? Love it. Can't wait for it to come back on in February.
5,And gets better and better...,"Season One started it all. Now we're in Season 3, and the show is addictive! Haven't seen The Walking Dead? You must see this series!"
5,Suprised how much I like this!,"I am normally a squeamish person, and I will admit there are scenes in this show that I have to turn away from, but for the most part, this show focuses on the stories and interactions of the different characters. The gore is background. The stories and human interaction is the focus and what I come back for week to week."
5,"Fantastic show, great price. I love it.","After hearing and seeing countless reviews for this show, I decided to plunk my money down and purchase season one. Me and my wife were not disappointed. We are huge horror fans and love most things in this genre, except my wife hates zombie films. Well she loves the Walking Dead and we were both hooked, we started it Saturday night, by Sunday we had watched all of season one and watched episodes 1 and 2 of Season 2 on demand.Great story line, awesome special fx and makeup. Not since George Romero's cult classic has someone got the Zombie thing so right. Five stars all the way and oh so more enjoyable without commercial breaks, buy it you will not be sorry, just do not watch alone."
5,Love Walking Dead,Have watched season one and two on Netflix. Who would have thought this series would be such a blockbuster? Excellent if your into zombies! Would recommend to all zombie lovers!
5,Riding on the Edge of Your Seat,"When I first heard of this I said to myself, ""Okay yea another zombie gore fest."" But this show is so much more than that. It actually has GOOD acting even though there aren't many actors that you'll recognize. There's drama, romance, a bit of dark comedy and of course plenty of THRILLING horror. This is one of those shows that once you buy the box set you'll say, ""One more episode."" Then realize at 3 in the morning that you can't turn it off. The zombies look amazing and they do an excellent job of portraying a post apocalyptic world. I highly recommend this series. You won't regret it!!!"
2,"The Walking Dead Season 1 ""Special"" Edition","I do NOT recommend this product to ANYONE.While ""The Walking Dead"" is a first-class show, this ""Special"" edition package isn't worth the pressing. $25 is what you'd expect to pay for a COMPLETE television series' season...not a 6-episode, teaser season.Having not known how short the season was, to say I disappointed at my purchase is a magnificent understatement. Besides the scant number of episodes, the ""bonus features"" are sorely lacking, not even warranting the 3rd disc at all (final 2 episodes on 2nd disc, then a black & white version of the pilot and a featurette on the 3rd)...that was a purely marketability ploy.Having only seen the latest season since returning from a year-long military deployment to Afghanistan, I was very anxious to catch up with this acclaimed zombie series. Unfortunately, the high-cost/low-return investment on this scam makes it a ""Must NOT See!"" Do yourself a favor and buy the digits from Amazon for $9.99"
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I was really excited to see a zombie series but am a bit disappointed. Although the show is good for TV, it's not great - certainly not as good as it could be. I find most of the characters annoying and I don't care when they get killed off (in some cases I was glad to see them go). Worth watching, but not deserving of the hype."
3,Not as great as everyone says it is,"I watched the entire season and i will say this... The first three episodes are great and exciting and then the last few episodes are painfully slow and uninteresting. Even with tempo aside, its just your average run of the mill zombie plot. How this has so many critics raving and 5 star reviews is beyond me. However i will say that i am looking forward to the upcoming season (with cautioned anticipation) because it still is after all a well made show in regards to production value and acting. Just work on the plot and lets give credit where credit is due."
3,Decent show. A little slow moving. Don't waste your $ on HD.,The connection was never good enough to actually stream in HD. I end up in standard so I could watch.
3,Not Quite As Expected,"In the advertisements they are advertised as a Canadian version ""Tin"" Well the tin turns out to be cardbvoard which was a bit of a disappointment"
5,season 1,After hearing talk about the show I thought I would check it out. Couldn't understand what was going on in current episodes so got the first season...I loved it! I'll be getting the second season soon.
4,Buy It,I bought this show and watched the whole season in the first day. I love zombie movies and this reached my needs. Storyline is amazing acting is also outstanding but it can be slow at times. If you like zombie movies then i suggest you buy this first season
5,"Brains, brains!!",Perfect set for the zombie lover. I gave this as a present and the recipient almost ate me alive :)
5,good series,"A good and fun series, recommend for a good weekend marathon. The special effects and story line are very good"
4,"Good, but short season",The first season was pretty good for being 6 episodes long and is a must for walking dead fans to get.
5,Wow!,I started watching this show at the beginning of Season 3. I was excited to be able to catch up!
4,A pretty decent show.,"First off, let it be known I am a hardcore horror movie nerd. I love b movies, and low budget flicks. I wasn't too sure what to think of a mainstream zombie tv show, but I was surprised! The zombies are pretty much an afterthought and the real meat and potatoes of the show are the characters. Very well done, a great show, even if you are a horror movie junkie like me, you'll still dig this."
5,patience,"It didn't seem like sucha great series in the first episode or two, once it really got rollingf it became suspenseful. Sure there were a few scenes or episodes that stood out, but what I enjoyed was the survivalist modes put into place."
5,Zombie Lovers Dream,This is a great series about Zombies taking over the world and how people can cope with the future. The scenes with the zombies are raw and full of suspense with a great story arc. I'm really looking forward to the second series this summer
5,Good Start for Walking Dead,"I have been a fan of the comic book, so It was nice to watch this first episode. The Tv show adds little things to help the characters grow. I can't wait the next episode."
3,Sad thing I have to review a product and not the show itself,"As far as the show goes it's a slow roll pretty much each episode, the first disc is amazing on blu ray. It looks wonderful, the acting is great, and the special effects are amazing.However this is where the ""PRODUCT"" part comes in, this is SO not worth the price as there are only 5 episodes and the lackluster behind the scenes stuff was somewhat interesting. Having never seen the show, but heard so much about it, I was sorely disappointed after watching all the content.I've read some of the comics and really looked forward to this especially since Greg Nicotero was doing the EFX, but 40 bucks is a stretch...20 maybe....maybe if you are a fan."
5,ITs not really about zombies!,"My brother recommended this show to me and I was not interested. I did not like horror zombie movies and things like that, but he persisted so I caught the first episode in a rerun and I loved it. My husband and I are now both completely hooked on this show! I must say you have to watch the seasons in order to understand all that has happened and what is happening. I purchased season one and watched them all to catch up to season 2 then watched season 2 and now season 3 on AMC. This show is more about relationships, and how you trust people. It is much more than zombies, yes there are zombies and it is violent and graphic (very well done too) but it is more about survival. It really makes you think, about a lot of things in life. Try it!!!!"
5,movie time,"great price good deal,I am looking forward to make more purchase.hope to order walking dead ,second season if available at same price."
3,"When this geek was too brain-dead to do anything else, I watched this.","I'm not into the zombie genre but I did like ""I am Legend"" and the 60's classic ""The Last Man on Earth"" (oops, and The Omega Man) which were basically all based on the book I am Legend. Anyway, this is as close to ""I am Legend"" being made into a series as I've seen. Somehow I can connect with the characters and want them to survive, and I suppose that's why I kept watching episodes through the first season. Talk about breathing new life into an old genre! Also, I love the way the ""walking dead"" are called ""geeks"", since I imagine that geeks make up much of the demographic that make this show so popular.I gave it three stars because it's obviously low budget (but pretty well acted), requires some suspension of disbelief, and the redneck stereotype guy got sort of predictable (always going off over something) but then again it's a show I watched when I was brain-dead at the end of the day so that stuff didn't matter much."
5,The Walking Dead,The Walking Dead is a great graphic TV show. Most of the charcters have different persoalaties witch makes you not know what is going to happin. I have seen every episode and I love it. If you are going to watch it you should start at season 1. The show is on at 9:00 eastern time on AMC.
2,Not my cuppa,"I love horror films, comic book films, and unique television series that take me somewhere I can't go everyday. I had high hopes for this series being of interest to me, but after a few attempts to sit through a couple of episodes, I've decided this is just not for me. I couldn't get into the characters, the plot, the scenarios whatsoever. I'm glad some people find this interesting, there truly is something for everyone. If you are curious to preview an episode, Amazon Instant Video has a sneak peek as a free download. If I would have just seen that I would have known this is not for me."
2,The video played well,While I can't say the quaility of the streaming sucked I can say I really didn't care for the content. I tried to watch this series because I was told how great it was. I found it to be just your typical zombie junk and I didn't care for it at all.
4,"HD version good, TV version bad","The TV version ($1.99) was so bad we couldn't watch it on our computer in full screen. The HD version ($2.99) was fine, however, no hiccups. If you have a smaller screen, the TV version is probably fine. We have a 25' HP HD computer screen. I'm putting 4 stars for the show, but the TV version of it would get 1 star."
5,The best,"Was and continues to be awesome! Was a gift for a family member, best ever. Can not wait for more seasons to continue this collection."
5,"Wow, I am not a zombie fan...and this is one of my favorite shows of all time!",What can I say really about The Walking Dead?! I was late getting on the bus for this one because I'm not a big zombie fan. But this is one fantastic show! Some of the best character driven entertainment I've ever watched. It reminds me of Firefly the way you get sucked into the story and these characters. Just keep up the good work AMC ;)
2,Just not into Zombies.,"This show is highly rated. I watched the first episode. Got somewhat intrigued as to what caused all of these zombies to be walking around, but didn't stay with it. Just not into zombies I guess."
5,Love it so far!!!!!,"Seen the first two episodes, plus the sneak peak of the 3rd.Love the show so far, and I hope it continues to be so much more than ""just about the zombies"".I can't wait to see him reunite with his wife, and see what explodes there.I've just ardered Compendium one of the comic book series, just becasue it's reviewes are so good, and i can;t wait to see what is up next.Definatly the best new show in production.Brian."
4,Must have for Walking Dead Fans,I really love The Walking Dead series and if you're like me then you really should have this in your collection. The picture quality is a little rough but I figure it was the film used for the tv series. I'm still glad though I purchased it on Blu-Ray.
5,outstanding!!!,An outstanding edition of the success TV series. The black and white version of episode 1 adds a 'Romero touch' to the show. A 'must-have' for every fan!
3,"Love the show, hate the package.","This show is incredible, but for some reason when you buy the original version and not the new re-release version of the blu-ray product, the second disc is simply a DVD not blu-ray like previously anticipated. The first four episodes are high quality but the last 2 are on the second disc and are obviously not nearly as good quality when watching them compared to the first 4. I feel like I just got punked by AMC, then they re-release the whole thing in a bigger, better package with an extra disc of bonus materials. Thanks for the love AMC, I hope that second disc saved you a good chunk of change and ripped off your consumer. Never buying a show I watch on AMC again."
5,Great show!!!,"I've watched every episode of The Walking Dead so far. I think this is a great show filled with surprising twists. I'm an avid zombie fan and usually like all things zombie-related, but this is definitely one of my favorite zombie works. I definitely wouldn't recommend letting children watch the show even though it does come on basic cable, but that's just me :)"
3,no 3 disk special...,"I have only one complaint.. It was a ""3 disk special"" and the dvd that I got was only a 2 disk set. False advirtisement? Or you just cant count?"
1,Third time's NOT the charm....,"After watching the 1st and second episodes and reading all the inexplicably glowing reviews I decided maybe the story would get better, mature, obtain SOME sort of positive or entertaining spin, so I watched this third episode. OMG!!! How is this dribble getting five starts?!! It HAS to be the AMC people, horrible HORRIBLE acting, storyline. ugh, I want my money back WITH interest for having lost those minutes of my life. UNreal how awful this is - OMG"
2,The world has enough zombies already.,"What a shame. I watched the first episode because of the good reviews about production quality. Must agree with that! But I'm not into fantasy made-up zombies or vampires. Boring. It would have been a great survival series if they had used real zombie-like humans as in "" The Road ""."
1,"WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!! Not the Show, but the Blu-ray set!!","Its A Very Good Show. But just to give everyone a heads up. Out of the 2 disk Blu-ray set they have episodes 1-4(ON BLU-RAY)on the first disk, which is great! But the second disk is not a Blu-ray at all... Its a regular dvd with episodes 5-6(DVD) on it... I mean what gives???? Anchor Bay pulled a fast one and I fell for it.. I don't buy dvds anymore because I live in the year 2011 and own a 2011 HD tv.. They could of at least put the information on the box for crying out loud.. I paid for a Blu-Ray 2 disk set. And the result was that I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.. This is a rip off..."
5,The Walking Dead,The best show on TV; I would recommend it to anyone...well; not kids under 14. It is definately an adult program.
3,Its OK - Season 1 - Copy of 28 Days Later minus good acting,Most of the plot came from 28 Days Later and a lot more of it doesn't make sense. It's fun to watch until the really poor dialogue gets to you. I bought the entire season before I watched any and I was fast fwding through lengthy emotional scenes that did nothing for the plot right away. Maybe watch it if you cant find any other single show in the world to watch first.
4,Love this series!,"Love the Walking Dead series. I often miss it when it comes out on Sunday nights and buy the Amazon Instant Video version on Mondays so I can watch it ASAP! The instant video interface is easy to use online, on my TV, video streamer or XBOX."
4,I'm sorta hooked,"It is a little too gruesome in spots but I like the series. As I progressed through the series, the story pulled together and really started to enjoy the show. Season 2 is even better."
3,Good for the sale price,"I bought this knife at a brick and mortar store for nearly double the listed amazon price (fail on my part). Blade easily dulls and the clip to put it on your pocket or pants fell off in the first week. It is held on by tiny allan screws that I kept having to retighten. That said, the knife has seen some rough times and the hinge operates smooth. The locking mechanism still works like day 1 no issues there. Solid knife if you're willing to not have a clip and can sharpen it frequently."
2,"Cute, but not comfy","This shoe is cute, but the leather is very hard. I had to place insoles in the shoes for them to be comfortable. Even still, I can only wear them for two hours at a time. I would not recommend the purchase of this shoe."
2,not comfortable,"these shoes were okay on size, but they are pretty stiff therefore not comfortable; not recommended. oh, and the silver part is slightly sparkly which is not what I wanted. :("
1,Alien vs Hunter = Guys in bad costumes!,"Was this a comedy? I couldn't stop laughing at the bad acting, bad sets, bad lighting and bad dialogue. This is like the movie you see being made while watching a real movie, you know, the one so hokey you know it's not real. Don't ever be fooled by these ""film makers"" this is pure garbage in a bad way!"
1,Just plain bad. Can I give it less than 1 star?,"There are some movies that are so bad they end up good. Then there are the ones that are just plain bad. This one fits in the latter category. I went into this movie with really low expectations, and I was still disappointed. It might be so bad that even the Sci-Fi channel won't show it. The acting is stilted, the photography is poor - it really needed another pass of color correction, the animation is jerky, the alien costuming looks home made. I get the feeling that maybe this was a film school project that somehow made it into mainstream circulation."
1,Sin City,This movie sucks big time. In other words it bunk!!!! If I can use that word these days. To me the alien seems to like stalking behind these one set of trees because each time I saw it that is where it was coming from. And the ending just didn't make sense to me at all and I sure the other Aliens vs movies maybe just as bad.
1,A $2 Movie To Be Sure,"In the opening scenes this actually looked like it was going to be good, sadly it went down hill from there but since I got it for $2 I didn't feel too bad and felt I got my $2 worth. I like William Katt as an actor and wish he was given better roles than this."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY FILM,"Appauling from start to finishNothing like the excellent book by Dean KoontzIm sure that they stuck Corey in this film because of his highpoularity at the time,but I heard that Haim seriously regrettedbeing in the filmThis film is about as scary as opening a box of Coco Pops,theeffects are poor,The music belongs to an action cartoon,the other actors in the film range from boarderline exceptable to stand up comedianMichael Ironside was convincing and Corey Haim was watchablebut only because he was popular at that timeBarbra Williams has acted in better films too!!Give it a miss (for Coreys sake)"
1,Beyond Terrible,"Never have I viewed a movie that strayed so far from the source material it was practically unrecognizable. I'm writing this review to save you from ever considering buying or renting this movie. I watched it because I loved the Koontz book--but this movie was obviously just a ploy to cash in on the popularity (at the time) of Corey Haim. The protagonist in the book is an man, not a teenager. Trying to turn this movie into a teen flick was a big mistake. Too bad they didn't stick with the novel and make a great movie, with great actors. The book deserved better treatment.ACK! Please, I beg of you, don't waste your time."
2,Campy at Best,"Once in a while, a movie comes along like this. While one actor is slowing descending into the B-movie pit, another actor is paying his dues. I'm talking about Corey Haim and Jason Priestley, who are both in this movie. Somewhere between The Lost Boys and Me, Myself, and I, Corey Haim made a silly movie about an intelligent dog, a crazy killer, a blood-thirsty gorilla like creature and the late 80's punk teen caught up in the middle. I liked the movie as a child, but find it laughable now that I'm older. Any movie that has Michael Ironside gouging out a man's eyeballs with his bare fingers as least deserves some credit. Too bad they couldn't give the then unknown Jason Priestley a groady death scene. While running from the monster, he falls off a cliff and is never heard from no more."
4,It's not that bad,"I just watched this movie & the only thing I didn't like about it was it was too dark. For a horror movie it wasn't bad at all. If you like horror movies & don't want to buy it, rent it first just to check it out. Then if you like it, buy it. You can get it for a low price on Amazon.com."
1,Coud have been worse.,"But I don't see how. This film is not even close to the great thriller novel that Dean Koontz wrote. I am reading the Koontz novel for perhaps the fifth time, and enjoying it as much the first time. I watched the movie once, and that was one time too many. The only similarity I can see between the two is the Golden Retreiver.I would like to see a remake that is actually based on the novel as Dean Koontz wrote it."
2,I Heard The Novel Was Much Better!,"(...)This movie wasn't only bad. It was worse. There weren't that many actors in this movie, and the filmwork looked pretty poor. I remembered I liked this film when I was about twelve years old. But I've recently seen it, and I can tell you, it ain't that much of a good movie.Yes, it's got lots of gore, and the acting ain't that bad, but it's too stupid. If you're a Dean R. Koontz fan, then I would suggest you stick with his novels. There's a major difference between books and films. I myslef haven't read the novel yet, so I wouldn't know.(...)"
1,Didn't quite meet the mark,"Although it was packaged in an YSL opium bottle and box, the fragrance was not quite that of Opium Eau De Toilette Spray..."
2,Bug vacume,"well....3 strikes and your OUT!! I bought this item 3 times..( yup, I'm a sucker, shame this vacume wasn't) and each time the unit just STOPED! No motor, no nutin!I'll stick to a fly swater and a broom..."
4,Pretty good wraps,"I bought these because the price was just right. They do the job, but they are not very comfortable and if you have smaller wrists like me, getting them good and tight can be a bit tricky with the lack of the fuzzy veclro part. I find that I have to constantly adjust and re-wrap my wrists with these after almost each lift. They get four stars because they will get the job done and they are priced so cheap. But there are definitely better wrist wraps out there. I like the Harbinger ones a bit more because the material is more comfortable and the velcro seems to be a better fit for me personally. Either way, I would still recommend these and will use these from time to time."
4,Added tension to the wrist,My wrist was hurting and after buying the product I found it actually helped. I cut the thumb loop off because it was lame but it did help putting the wrap on. Without the loop it's a bid more difficult to wrap but still doable. I gave it 4 stars because the thumb loop was lame in my opinion.
5,Valeo Elastic Wrist Wrap with Thumb Loop,Great Product at a great price. Ordered it for my son for an upcoming weight lifting match. He love the way they felt and gave him extra strength during his lifting.
4,Acceptance of ourselves,"The author, Angela Hunt writes from experience. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially women who still struggle from time to time with self-confidence, the Truth, and lack of understanding feelings of guilt.For me it was helpful to read the book several weeks. This allowed me to use the suggestions at a slower pace."
4,encouraging,"This book was recommended for my daughter by a therapist at her inpatient facility she's in for anorexia. I bought it for her and read it first. I thought it was excellent, but thought many of the thoughts were for an older person...she's 14. After buying this book I realized there is a version for teens. I purchased that for her too. She said the girls at the center all loved the teen version that was done in a magazine format. So, great book for an adult, but if it's for a teen, I'd go with the book modeled after this one just for them!"
4,"A biblically sound, feel-good book","I enjoyed the book. It was an easy read that made me feel good about myself, my life, my faith, and my God. There wasn't anything ""earth shattering"" or truly ""new"" in the book, but reminders of what we already know can often be helpful and uplifting. If you are struggling with who you are independent of your relationships or if you are just feeling a bit ""down in the dumps,"" this is a good book to read. It incorporates personal testimony and anecdotes with scriptural references. A light read, full of deep Truths, may be exactly what we need when we're not feeling strong."
1,I couldnt even finish this one.,"I got this book as a gift and was excited to read it. I made it one chapter in and couldn't go on. The writing level of this text seemed that of a middle schooler and could not keep my attention. I had my husband read the first chapter as well to get a second opinion and he laughed when he noticed how juvenile the reading level was. From what I read I think this book would be great for a child/ young adult. The message is great for girls. But, personally the writing style and level just didn't do it for me."
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,"This book came in perfect condition, so i would definitely buy from this seller again. But I also think the book was one of the most profound and powerful and moving books i've ever read in my life. I was crying in the first ten pages. It is a wonderful read, funny and wise and life-changing. I would definitely recommend to any woman--and I have! :)"
4,Great Book,"I haven't finished this book yet, but I liked it enough to go out and buy the workbook that goes with it so that I could find out more about myself!"
3,Non standard mounting,Only problem here is that it uses non standard mounting.Unlike others that match an electrical box screw holes this one has the holes way to wide. So its only for sheetrock or wood mounting. If you old one was mounted to an electrical box then only 1 screw will fix.I think you can get a baseplate because its listed in the manual but others do not need baseplates to fit standard mounting screws.
5,Another great video,"As in Volume 1 Gaither's excellence at putting a DVD together once again shows. Very,very enjoyable"
2,Huge disappointment,"What a huge disappointment. When I buy a Gaither Gospel Series video, I expect to see and hear plenty of the Homecoming Friends harmonizing with whatever guest personalities happen to be present. This one was way too short on homecoming friends! Watching/hearing George Jones work his way through old hymns isn't my idea of Country Bluegrass. Furthermore, this video was produced without Gloria Gaither, and she was SORELY MISSED! I was sadly disappointed in this video, and its predecessor, Volume 1."
5,Incredible!,"It's hard to come up with a title for your review, when so many other people have already used up the obvious ones.But they are all correct: Everything about this DVD is absolutely terrific.There is just something about the down-home harmonies of the Grascals, for example, but actually, everyone in this whole production, that is so heartwarming.And they are obviously very appreciative of each other's talents, as you watch the faces of the other performers in the audience when they see Rhonda Vincent just simply light up the room with her amazing singing.So if you want to experience some truly great gospel and bluegrass performances, this is it."
3,"A great term paper, a boring book.","My title of this review really says it all. I love so many of the bands written about in this book, but it's just not fun at all to read. That being said, it has tons of really great information and when the when it's the musicians talking, it really is very interesting. I was not surprised that this book took me as long as it did to read (3 weeks), it's just so dull."
3,A Wonderful Topic That May Deserve Better Treatment,"Mr. Carson put a lot of work into this book. The depth of his research is great, and there are certainly more facts and details contained in his work than one could ever hope to completely digest. I say this, however, as an outsider. I picked up Carson's book hoping to familiarize myself with the evolution of Detroit rock, but found myself overwhelmed by the volume of statistics: artist, song, year, etc. without much contextual setup. If I already had a familiarity with Detroit music history, or maybe if I had grown up in the area, I wouldn't be as perplexed.It may have been overly ambitious to attempt to sum up over three decades of the musical history of such a culturally wealthy city in just over 300 pages (the rest are source notes). But, nevertheless, Carson's book serves as an excellent starting point for learning about Detroit Rock. His extensive documentation makes it easy to find additional reading and listening."
1,"Bad ""hot-spot"" and no-light","Previous owner of the Canon-A85 & Canon-housing, I upgraded to the Canon-A640 & Canon-housing. Being exited about the new 1cm macro feature, I was soon to be disappointed about the ""hot-spot"" and no-light as called in underwater photography. The housing casts a shadow over just about half the picture when doing very close macro shots. Even 'upping' the flash-power, does not help, it only manages to create a 'hot-spot' in the left top section of the photograph. What happens is that the lens is encapsulated in a black section within the housing. The flash can not reach the section lying in the shadow of the lens. Previous models probably did not have this problem, because it does not have such a short macro focal lenght. Certainly a huge design flaw from Canon!"
2,Canon Waterproof case,"I received this case, made by Canon, a couple of days befor departing for a dive trip, so I was able to test it right away. It was easy to load the camera, and it handled well. The diffuser plate worked well to dissipate the flash on close-ups. What I didn't like was that the camera had problems focusing under certain conditions, such as taking a picture of small crabs, brittle stars or other creatures inside vase sponges. I am not sure if this was due to the case or the camera itself. The biggest problem, however, was that the case leaked on the first dive, fortunately only small amounts, so the camera was not damaged. I had a professional check it and he said that the main o-ring had uneven spots. Also, certain buttons (i.e., the macro button, the left scrolling button, and the exposure button) would squirt droplets of water every time I depressed them under water. Amazon exchanged the item. I would have rated it higher if these problems hadn't occured."
2,"ok, but not as good as previous models.","I have been dissapointed in this case mostly because of my previous housing. My A80 housing is awesome mostly because the diffuser was way better. On this case the diffuser comes off and floats around, where as the previous was fixed and in a different configuration. There is an underwater setting on this camera which is ok, since you can't turn the flash 'on' in auto mode. The problem is when in uw mode using macro you can't get the entire subject in the ""flash"" leaving part of the photo dark. This was not a problem with my previous housing. I have actually stopped using this housing and reverted to my older camera and housing because of the problems I have getting good uw photos. On the upside, it has never leaked, and I am pretty rough on it."
5,A must have,"Although a bit bulky, I highly recommend it. I live in Hawaii, and it goes with me to the beach all the time. It's easy to use and the crystal clear cover doesn't distort and affect the quality of the shots. One great feature is that it floats! So we can toss it between friends to take photos of each of us. Great for skiing too, has the case acts like a shield for the camera.The camera inside is very tight and won't move. A very good item, but a bit pricey, considering that it fits ONLY the Canon Powershot 630. If your camera goes dead, your case will too.Looking for THE perfect Christmas present? How about a nice warm children book to read to your kid?The Hawaii Snowman"
2,Good for use other than which it is intended,"I purchased the Waterproof Case for my Powershot A640 to use on my family trip to Costa Rica. It worked well for day shots on the beach and I did not have to worry about sand getting into the camera or problems with humidity or rain and the potential damage to my A640. Unfortunately, the Waterproof case interferes with the flash, so all night/indoor or photos requiring a flash (underwater) include a large black square on the bottom right side of the photograph. This was very frustrating and is an obvious problem with the fundamental design of the underwater housing."
5,Excellent,"Excellente, it excellent, nice photos, the underwater photos very nice and of good color, you can use the flash and delete shadow on your photos even underwater"
3,farmy,I ordered 2 dozen they seem to be fine a tad bit in the small size in the opening and have a strange smell like old straw that has been in a barn for a while which does go away after a couple of days
1,not warm,"If you plan to buy these for winter use to keep you hands warm - they surprisingly don'tStanley 4323-01 8-Ounce Brown Jersey Gloves, Large, 12-Pair are actually much warmer and also have a softer feeling to them.But both will not do it for sub freezing"
1,This product contains magnesium stearate,"I do not buy any product that contains magnesium stearate. It is very bad for your colon. MANY vitamins have this added ingredient, including this one. There are plenty of Sun Chlorella companies out there that do not add this ingredient. Try to avoid it if you can. Other types of magnesium are ok...it's just the stearate we need to avoid. It leaves a thin, mucusy coating along your colon walls leaving it very difficult to absorb nutrients from food and vitamins. Google it and you'll find the truth! Good luck :)"
4,Best Deal on Chlorella,"This is the best deal I've found on Broken Cell Wall Chlorella. It is a better price even than buying direct from Swanson. If you are looking at this product you know it's benefits and that it is truly a must-have supplement.I have but one concern and that is quality control. The first bottle I got was direct from Swanson. The pills were dark green and seemed very potent. Then I found them for a better price on Amazon. However, the batch I received from Amazon was a light color and seems like it may not be quite as potent. I do not detect the fishy aftertaste another reviewer mentioned.All in all a good deal, if you get a good batch. A pricier yet higher quality alternative that I have tried and recommend is Kyoto Chlorella 200 mg 1500 Tabs."
2,Second-rate chlorella,"I had been using another brand of chlorella for some time with very good results; however, the cost was quite high, so I was looking for an alternative. I read the positive reviews for Swanson chlorella, so I thought I could save myself some money and I ordered some. I was very disappointed by the smell of the product. It almost smells fishy. I took it anyway, and my health condition seemed to deteriorate quickly; I felt fatigued and my joints began to ache. I switched back to the more expensive brand earlier last week. I can tell the difference in quality as soon as I open the package. I will not buy Swanson chlorella again. The cost savings are not worth the reduction in quality."
1,Not Unscented,"I have been buying this product for a number of years. In the past I liked how it moisturized without being greasy or leaving a residue, and because it was unscented. However, this time, although it still lists the same ingredients, it was quite scented, and gave me eczema. If your need an unscented product, I would not recommend it."
3,Contains glycerin,"Even though this lotion is oil-free, Stonybrook uses Vegetable Glycerin instead of the oil, considering that they are almost the same.Therefore, there is no point to even get this oil-free lotion if ingredients very similar to oil are being used, which can clog pores."
1,NOT Stoney Brook quaility buy if you can handle smells and burning,"The StoneyBrook Shampoo is great no smell, and really cleans.So I was excited to order the lotion,as I am super sensitive to smells andchemicals. It not only has a smell it felt like my hands were burning.Could not wash the tingling or smell off..Now I have a $6.00 bottle of lotion I cannot use, very disappointed."
5,I love it!,"I, too, needed an oil free lotion while on the hcg diet. I love this stuff. It saved my hands! My daughter and I both have oily skin and when we use this on our faces, our skin is not so oily the next day. I feels good going on and I love that there is no strong odor. Some products that are fragrance free, smell so bad that you know why they needed fragrance. I even took it today to a massage appointment and it worked well for the therapist, not quiet the same, but she said that she liked it. I'm going to order more even though I'm done with the diet, just because it works so well on my face. If only it could feel and smell like this AND have sun protection, that would be ideal."
3,oil free lotion,"The lotion has a decent moisturizing effect but I bought the product for use with the HCG diet. As a massage therapist I was looking for a product I could use on clients while still adhering to the diet protocol of no oil. Unfortunately it does not work as a massage lotion, there is no slip so it is very difficult to complete a stroke or even specific spot work without consistently lifting your hand and replacing it on the client. I ended up mixing it with grapeseed oil for my massages and it tended to peel a bit so can't say it works well for massage but it does work as a personal moisturizer."
3,Gets the job done,I needed a lotion for my dry skin that didnt cause acne so I went for an oil-free lotion. This lotion gets the job done but it smells like sunblock and gos on your skin like it to.
5,Great moisturizer,I looked all over at my local pharmacies ect. and could not find a decent unscented oil free moisturizer. Was very pleased to find this product on Amazon and it works great.
2,poor reception,most fm stations that i can receive with clarity on other receivers come in with static. fortunately the station i usually listen to comes in with clarity.
3,GE 74235 Spacemaker AM/FM Undercabinet Radio,"The GE Spacemaker undercabinet radio is, in general, a well designed compact unit. We purchased this radio to replace an older GE Spacemaker version. The new radio used the same mounting holes. The five presets for each radio band makes it very easy to select favorite radio stations. One of the disapointing features is the blue light background makes reading the clock rather difficult. Also, the description in the Amazon writeup indicated that the radio comes with a battery backup and bass speaker adjustment, but our unit did not have these features."
5,"Never mind the subject , good engrossing documentary","I'm not a Metallica fan and would have hated to miss out on seeing a great documentary because I didn't like the music .If you have not seen this because of your own musical preferences , I encourage you to put those aside , as you will be missing out .Watch and see how the very successful and wealthy cannot just use money to help with problems that arise . Rather , they have to rely on talking to each other .We all do , I suppose .A fascinating film ."
1,Blah.,"Way too long. Way too boring. Way too narcissistic. James is selfish. Lars is well....Lars. Cries over the pain of parting with his precious paintings while the auctioneers rack up the millions they sell for. They talk about their feelings and their anger and they talk about it endlessly. I couldn't even finish it. Kirk is the only one that even comes close to being anything short of a caricature and even he has to talk about how ""real"" he is. Once you have to start telling people how ""real"" you are, you're already too far gone. And the $40,000 per month life coach is ripe for a twelve step parody on Saturday Night Live. This is just dreck. And they poke fun at Jason, which if they were in touch with reality at all, they would know that he's the only one in the band that anyone ever thought had any integrity at all. Unless you're a total brainwashed Metallica sheep, don't waste your time."
4,hmmm.....,This documentary confirm what i was thingking back in mid-eighties when i've first watched an interview of metallica : Metallica IS James and Kirk... Lars is just a jumping itching and selfish controling BUG (the only positive point he brought to the band are diamond heads covers).Great DVD and smarts bonusLove it !Long live Dave Mustaine
3,"Too long, but still very funny","Some Kind of Monster is worth watching just for all the unintentional humor. Seeing these guys go through therapy with a guy who looks like Mr Rogers is absolutely ridiculous. The movie does drag on a bit, especially in that there really is no urgency to it, yet it's more than two hours long. These dudes are clearly uninspired and no longer capable of creating honest music, so while they are running around in some sort of crisis, I sat there saying ""Who cares if they make this album or not?"" But it's definitely interesting to see a bunch of aging metalheads try and make aggresive music between taking their daughters to ballet lessons. I just wish there was more Dave Mustaine in the movie.Oh and Kirk is hysterical. The pink shirts, the wimpy voice, the balding... it's just too funny. He can still shred though, I'll give him that."
2,Comedy of the Year!!!!!,"This should be re-titled: Metallica: The making of St Anger staring Lars Ulrich. I felt this was more a making of, or the Lars Ulrich show, (who gives a s*** about you selling your Paintings for millions of dollars) then a documentary of the band falling apart, yes there were some interesting pieces, the interview with a near crying Mustaine, James talking about home life and how badly he treated his family (surprised his wife stuck around... must be his money) & Jason's views on the future of Metallica etc etc... but with a running time of over 2 hours and way too much rehearsal footage I would only recommended only to die hard fans. Or fans of St Anger... if any."
4,The dynamics of a strangely dysfunctional band...,"""Metallica: Some kind of monster"" is a peculiar documentary on a famous metal rock band intent on recording a new album, something that ends up taking years, and a lot of pain and fights among band members.Despite the fact that I am not a fan of Metallica, I must say that I enjoyed watching this film. It has plenty of things to interest spectators, as it gives them the opportunity to witness the making of ""St Anger"" (Metallica's new album) and the dynamics of a strangely dysfunctional band. Of course, I must also mention Metallica's sessions with Phil Towle, a ""performance enhancement coach"", as one of the highlights of this dvd :)In my opinion, fans will love this dvd, and people who have barely heard about Metallica will like it too. ""Metallica: Some kind of monster"" is a very good documentary worth watching, even if it is not the kind of dvd you generally rent.Belen Alcat"
3,"A Must See Film whether or not your a Metallica fan, Nothing Else Matters","for two decades they have been one of the biggest heavy metal bands of all time, selling more than million records since 1981. They have won many grammys in the rock catergories & this rockumentary is a look at what group therapy means as James, Lars & Kirk begin the recording their new album ""St. Anger"" while going through therapy, going through feuds & looking for a new bassist to replace Jason Neusted & look back at moments in the band's history. It's an intense & entertaining rockumentary, a film that defines anger music, a very well done rockumentary, a must see for Metallica fans or for metal fans. This is not a concert film, this is not behind the music, this is something else."
5,All you haters,Man most of these critics on the album on St. Anger and this movie. Do you all even have a life. The documentary is one of the best rock docs ever made. You have to be real bitter to not appreciate and understand the meaning behind this movie. This is a must see.
5,AWESOME!!!,"This was a great dvd, very insightful. It actually helped me understand the album better and appreciate it more."
4,very interesting,i was not sure if i would enjoy this documentary. however i am a fan of metallica and it was very interesting to see the band in a different light. very personal. very effective.
1,For christs' sake...,"Classic! Very cynical of them to take the p#ss out of everyone with this satirical dig at reality TV. I can't wait till they come out and tell everybody. Please, tell me I'm right?!I could not sit through this pile of crap. It is either the biggest practical joke played on whoever thought this was real or it is the most pathetic display of humanity I've seen! (ok, maybe not the most, but of a rock band for sure).That 'performance coach' must be some kind of comedy actor, but he is not funny. If he is real then the future is lost. Who would pay money for such an idiot? His comments are inane crap and the ""yeah, I hear what you're saying"" looks from the band are......I dunno, mentally retarded!Is this what a rock'n'roll lifestyle turns a person into? A moron? I can't get my head around this, Metallica are ""What is and Should Never Be"".Give up guys, your families need you to be normal. Unless it was all a joke of course..."
1,Cry Me a River...Bla bla bla,You got to be kidding me? This confirms 2 things I have already known.#1 Kirk has ZERO role or say in the band and the band is all James and Lars. Kirk is way overhyped as a guitar player compared to james who gets no hype considering he's one of the best player in the world.#2 They need to leave bob rock and make music again.Metallica is overkill. They are so overexposed it's not even funny.
1,Ashamed to be Danish,"Good GOD!! Is it possible that Lars Ulrich could possibly be as in reality as much of a materialistic, immature, spoiled cretin as it appears in this painfully long and banal documentary?????? He is an embarassement to the Danish people! As an amateur drummer I can tell you...he is much less prolific than most pre-teen speed metal drummers I run into in the local Guitar Center!!"
1,The Guys from Spinal Tap Have Done It Again!,"Hey, this is a really funny mockumentary! It's about this fictional band, not Spinal Tap, but this one's called Metallica. Get this... they call in a psychoanalyist to help them deal with their feelings... HA! It's really funny. There are some great scenes showing how the band comes up with some really moronic lyrics. They even have a fictional ex-member come into therapy, crying about how he was kicked out more than twenty years ago! So funny! How about, ""we can only listen to the recordings between 12 and 4."" That was just as funny as the first Spinal Tap, the ""turn it up to 11"" bit. Or there's the funny bit where they talk about how hard their lives are now, and then they show the balding one on his ranch. I even heard they put out a fake soundtrack, St. Anger, to go along with this very funny fake movie! You'll laugh until you pee! (Note- fake stars omitted, leaving only one)."
1,Don't waste your money,"Boooooring! I can not believe how anyone could find this movie ""fascinating"" it's just plain boring! A bunch of middle-aged whiney incredibly wealthy drunks boo-hooing about needing to have ""control"" over their lives.What a bunch of crybabies! Who among us really has any control in their lives.These guys are considered Gods by their millions of fans and all they can do is sit around and piss and moan about their poor pathetic lives.Give me a break! No concert footage,no glimpses into their early years,almost nothing about their wives or girlfriends or kids, just a bunch of poor sound quality clips about making just the one ""some kind of monster"" song.And that song is not that good anyway.I lost a tremendous amount of respect for Metallica when they made that CD with all the orchestra music ""S&M"".What a waste of money that CD was as well as this DVD."
2,bunch of cry babies.,Metallica are a bunch of cry babies. with out dave mustine or cliff burton they were nothing. Metallica first three records were the best. after that they suck big time.
3,"Well, it was interesting...","...seeing this overly long documentary about the creation of a Metallica album that few fans care about, myself included. I did enjoy being a voyeur; seeing how Metallica go about recording ""St. Anger"" and living their insanely wealthy lives. Everyone knows Lars Ulrich has an enormous ego, that came as no surprise. What surprised me, was that I walked away from this documentary having less respect for James Hetfield, who comes off as a bit of an egotist and also because he enjoys killing bears. I just don't like that. I have a lot more respect for Jason Newsted now, that's all I can say.It would have been super-cool if the filmmakers had followed Metallica around while they were recording, say, ""Master of Puppets"", or even the Black Album, instead they recorded the birth of one of the worst heavy metal albums in history. This documentary is not particularly good or bad, there's certainly nothing fascinating about it. Decide for yourself."
2,"We knew metallica went down, but whyd they take Mustaine with them!","This Movie is a must see for any metallica fan. It is really that horrible. Why, oh why!, did Dave Mustaine agree to show up for this. I never wanted to know that he would cry like a baby in on camera, i never wanted to know that Metallica was so far down the path of selling out they needed therapy to be METAL!And if you are wondering, YES you do need beer to make metal!"
2,not great,"All this did was proove to me that Newsted and Mustaine kick ass, Lars is a panzy with no talent, Hammet is a fruitcake and Hetfield is a redneck ass."
3,Decent Viewing,"Not a bad movie overall. Nice behind-the-scenes look at the making of the train wreck album St. Anger. This does offer a great explanation of why the album turned out to be their worst recording. With the therapist deeply involved, even with the some of the album making, to the reasons why Newsted left, and their new Democratic way of making music.The most interesting part of the whole movie was the Dave Mustaine segment. Although he came off as sort of a whiner, he did give some good statements on his view of why why he was kicked out of the band. I would like to have seen Hetfield talk to him, but Lars talking to him was good enough.If you like Metallica, or the album St.Anger, or both, you will like this movie. If you dont like either, this isnt recommended. It doesnt rank with other rockumentary's."
2,HORRIBLE EDITING + BOB ROCK,"I think i could have gotten more into this if the editing had not been so godawful. I spent so much time thinking ""Oh, Lars's hair is blond and short...wait-it's long and dark....now it's short again!!!"" that it was distracting. It also made me wonder what else in the movie was taken out of context and why this was done. Too Bad.ALSO, Bob Rock made me sick with every disparaging comment regarding Jason Newsted. He acted as though Jason was a ""hired hand"" when he was a member of this band for almost 15 years! I got the impression Bob was sad and jealous that they didn't ask HIM to be the new member. Shame on him."
2,"Just Another ""Reality"" Show",This one drags on far too long. Heavy metal stars engaging in endless melodrama and psycho-babble isn't my idea of entertainment or enlightenment.
1,very disappointing,"This was the worst documentary I've ever seen! When I heard there was going to be a documentary about Metallica I was thrilled! Couldn't wait to see it. Well I wish I didn't waste my money. I even turned it off 3/4 of the way through because I simpley couldn't stand it! (and I never turn off films) If you like group hugs, and a shrink to help express your feelings about how to open a pop can with out upsetting anyone, than this is the movie for you.I don't mind the therapeutic process.. BUT FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE?!? No wonder I never heard anything about it after it got released. I'm more irritated than anything. I was expecting a rock'n movie about one of the most pivotal metal bands ever to record an album... But instead it's just a long.. long, therapy session. Absolutly nothing about the past albums, life on the road, or anything else to do with the band other than their communication problems.. boooorrring!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,What the freak happend to what was once a good band!?,"Gramm says, ""It's the stupidest movie ever! You watch it, you die!"" I aggree, your brain will disconect with your body if you do. I feel sorry for Metallica really, they suck and they don't even know it. What happend! Lars said the decided to drop the solos because it set them back to a certain period. Considering every song they ever recorded had a solo, I cant think of any era this sets them back to other than CRAP! I did't want to see dave mustaine cry, I didn't want to see james with cut hair I didn't want to watch it at all. Ten minutes in I wanted to kill myself for watching it."
1,"""Some Kind Of Joke""","""no im not a kid"". if this is a joke i'm not laughing because i dont think this band could go any lower than it is now. the fact that st. anger was the worst cd ever released conforms my worst fears and if their, think they can get away with this treason by releasing a dvd trying to explain what they went though to make st.anger why bother. ""the thing that should not be"", i bet cliff is rolling around in his grave, mustaine laughs at this in disgust, and the fans look at them and cry, it makes me really depressed because 10 years ago metallica would have been distgusted at this as well. this reveiew is from an ex-metallica fan. R.I.P burton. good bye metallica?"
1,An Absolutley Wonderful Comedy - Two Thumbs up,"This is an absolutely wonderful comedy starring James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich with Kirk Hammet in a riveting supporting role . This is comedy at its best. Three prima donnas who've got the world by the balls complaining about how difficult life is. The three most vain , self absorbed , egocentric men ( men ? ) in rock and roll. I'm a huge fan of Kill Em All , RTL and MOP , but im sick and tired of hearing these three whiney washwomen complian about everything from Napster to Jethro Tull. Grow up boys ... there are a growing number of us fans who are absolutley disgusted ( and amazed ) at seeing three grown men act like 12 year olds girls. Do ya think you could possibly take your faces out of your handkechiefs long enough to put a decent album out ?"
3,Cute holiday family movie,"Cute holiday family movie. Dolly Parton plays a country singer, Ruby Diamond, who meets an untimely death. Before being allowed to enter heaven she must do a good deed and help a family. Ruby becomes the nanny for a family mourning the loss of their mother. The father has become a workaholic and the children feel neglected. Her mission is to bring this family together. This is a cute Christmas movie for the whole family."
5,Loved it!,"I video taped this on VHS when it first came out on tv. I was so happy when it went to DVD. I love it! I watch it every Christmas, religiously. It's a great reminder to not just let life pass us by but to actually live it, to actually reach out and help people instead of getting so comfortable in our lives that we never step beyond ourselves."
3,Dolly Parton,"I really like Dolly Parton, this movie was ok but it not one that i would watch over and over again. However, I was glad I purchase it, because I had not seen this one."
4,A heartwarming movie,I enjoyed this movie very much. It was heartwarming and also had some funny parts which both made for good viewing. I would recommend this movie for all who just want a feel good movie with a good outcome.
4,Dolly at her best in the acting department.,"I have seen all of Dolly's work, and this is the best by far. Next to 9 to 5 this is tops. She is very believable in her part. As she has matured, so has her acting and singing as well. One thing about it, Dolly sure offers a lot of variety in the movie and video department."
5,good movie,thanks for the fast service with the product am watching it a lot.came within a couple of days of ordering would order from you again.
5,Great movie...,I saw this movie serval times years ago on TV and just got it for $5 throught Hastings.comI couldn't believe when I found it.
5,Unlikely Angel,"This is a wonderful family movie about how a singer (Dolly Pardon) went to Heaven and was able to come back to earth and help out a family by being their Nanny. Through her, she was able to put some values and repect back into the children and the family was able to re-connect with one another. She then earned her ""wings' so to speak."
2,Average and cliched Holiday Fare,"Typical holiday story involving a family that needs angel Dolly(!) to bring them together again. C'mon, folks, haven't we seen this at least 15,000 times before?"
3,"Cute, but...","This was a cute, feel-good movie, and I always like a happy ending. I like Dolly's music and believe she is a woman of character. However, when I sit down to a family movie with my impressionable children (boys and girls), I really don't want them seeing Dolly's cleavage, or Dolly dressed in short skirts or a s*xy negligee. Yes, I know this is Dolly's style, but I just don't want it in a family movie. It makes it hard to reconcile to my children why an otherwise ""good"" character is dressed that way."
2,Many Digital Flaws on FOCUS Dvd's.,"I love the film. It is so entertaining and watching Dolly is always a treat!. The quality of the Disc was pretty bad. In the 2nd half of the movie, the picture started going digital crazy and the sound would pop and after a bit get back on track and be fine, until, of course, it happened again and again. We finally turned the movie off. Disc was marketed by FOCUS Entertainment. Watching it with commercials on live TV was more pleasurable than watching this disc. Very disappointed with the quality. Should have returned it, but it was a Dvd and return policy doesn't take back anything opened. I'd really like a good copy of this film. Is there one out there??????"
3,unlikely angel,"Great movie if you like Christmas entertainment. Now that we have it, we will watch it at least once during the holiday season."
1,DVD terrible quality,The DVD skips and stop playing. I'm very very disappointed as I was buying a new DVD. I don't know if I will be wanting to order anymore on line.
5,Cute Movie..,I bought this movie for my Mom cause she wanted it and we watch together really enjoyable..We pull out every so often to watchmakes you laugh..
5,excellent product,i had never used a ceramic pad before and i am here to tell you that unless i am on a drag strip. i will use this brand of pads on everything i own. excellent stopping power.
4,Nice Quality Concert,"I enjoyed this DVD quite a bit. It was great getting to know the band, but I thought these inserts interrupted the flow of the concert. I would've preferred there be a separate section on the dvd for this. Good selection of songs on the concert itself. They certainly generate a lot of energy from their fans, which made it all the more worth while."
5,Feels like youre really there!,"This was an absolute awesome DVD. The crowd was hyped the entire time and Three Days Grace rocked out! This DVD had a great mix of songs from One X and the first Three Days Grace CD's. All of my favorite songs like Pain, Riot, Just Like You, and I hate Everything About You. It felt like I was part of the crowd. TDG is my favorite band and will be forever!"
2,Glad the price went down AFTER I bought it!,"Ok, maybe I'm old fashioned, but I think all the interviews should be on their own separate title track and not in-between each song. The sound mix was a bit muddy also. Maybe we should concentrate on a better quality production and a little less on just being pissed off and hateful."
5,Antietam Revisited,"My kepi is off to Mr.Harsh. His latest work, dare I say, takes the place of Murfin's ""The Gleam of Bayonets"" The detail of troop movement is quite precise, and is followed up by sound research!It's as if Harsh rode aside Lee as he spoke at length of his strategy, movements, and inner most thoughts, then Harsh carefully jotted them down and sent them off to the presses. The book is quite captivating, and pleasently lacks the usual focus on trivial matter. This book is truly the meat and potatoes of the ""Maryland Campaign"""
3,R.I.P. DPG,"I love Tha Dogg Pound, but all I can say is, it's a shame they spent their last few good years beefing. If they stepped up their maturity levels around 2002-2003 they could'ce made 1 last quality album.But if you're a fan, you still gotta pick this up."
3,Cluck power,"She does the minimal solo thing much more effectively then one of her overrated influences, and her vocal command is impressive if slightly abused. However, this is still one of those albums to help listeners familiarize and make future investments in the artist rather then being a complete success in and of itself."
2,"Unremarkable results, maybe unreasonable expectations?","I purchased this not really for it's intended purpose of cleaning jewelry, but because I remembered a childhood friend using one to clean off carbon deposits on spark plugs. I figured that cleaning hearing-aid tubes would be a cinch.Well, it seemed to have no effect on hearing aid tubes. So I tried a few more things and the results were not remarkable. It may be great for jewelry, but I just don't know."
5,Great Cleaner!,"Everything I put in the Haier Ultasonic Jewerly Cleaner comes out sparkling and bright. Eyeglasses, watches and especially diamonds come out brilliant."
4,Something to think about!!!,"DeLillo has given us all something to think long and hard about. DeLillo creates in David Bell what many have seen in America, a success hungry, impatient and careless entity. Delillo provides a great example of high post-modern literature and I recomend it to anyone who wants to get a litte closer to what it means to ""be on top"" in Americana."
3,White Noise?,"A strange novel. The first hundred pages detailing the minutiae of office life including tedious office meetings and the bizzare but highly literate memos of the mysterious 'Trotsky' are by far the most engaging. Here Delillo, charting similar waters to those which Bret Easton Ellis would later navigate in American Psycho is at his highly amusing best in depicting the insanity of the US media environment in the Nixon Era. The tragedy of 'Americana' is that had Delillo only maintained this standard (and premise) throughout the whole novel it would now undeniably be regarded as an American literary classic ranking alongside the best of Salinger or Roth. Instead the main character embarks on a tedious journey across the American continent, which today sadly, mostly comes across like so much dated sixties sub-Kerouac claptrap. Some enjoyable later biographical episodes aside this is thus a generally disappointing work, but I'd recommend it for the superb opening chapters alone."
2,"Interesting, boring","The book is insightful, interesting and very relevant. The only problem for me was that the long descriptions and the general slowness with which the story unfolds bored me to the point where I had to force myself to keep reading."
3,"Good, but diminished by time and imitation","this was the first book of his I read. It's a good novel but compard to today's world of Ellis and Palahnuik. I could see the impact it had back when is first came out, since it was a few years after ""Easy rider"" and has the same counter culture feelthe style and nuance of the book were greatly influtential to ninties independant cinema. the protagnist seems indifferent and at times boring. Delillos has writen fantastic novels, and this is him cutting his literary teeth"
1,"This is some kind of joke, right?","Much to the protests of the DeLillo fanbase, I decided to undertake his first novel. And what an undertaking it was. It's been a long time since I had to actually work myself to get to the end of a chapter. While I held out as long as could, wading through endless trite observations and self-congratulatory manic-depressive episodes, the fact is these characters have no substance whatsoever. I'm sure his fans will contend that is exactly the point of the novel, but I'd rather learn that lesson from a read with an actual story. This novel was one meandering paragraph after another. I couldn't shake the overwhelming feeling that I was witnessing a bad reading from an old college writing class. It's the non-violent, deficient love-child of ""On The Road"" and ""American Psycho"". In the simplest terms, this is an extremely boring read. Some people can't cross the barrier between different types of writing, nor should they. Americana is an excellent case in point."
1,Crap,These didn't even fit my standard bar. It's exactly 1 inch and I could barely get the springs on. I recommend not buying these
2,it really is TOO SMALL,"Won't fit MOST standard sized bars. I have a home gym with standard 1"" attachments that I needed this for... doesn't fit. I even measured to ensure before ordering, but this springs are so tight that with all my strength I can get them open just barely enough to get over the end of the bar, but no further so it's still not securing the weight.Tried them on my standard straight bar. no luck. So basically if you have a bootleg ""not quite standard"" bar somewhere these might fit. But if you have almost any standard or 1"" piece of exercise equipment built by any brand it probably isn't gonna happen.Too bad. But at least they were cheap. Now to return them..."
2,Low quality,These collars did not stay on the bar when weighted down. Dangerous to use if you are bench pressing or using heavy weights. It was a waste of money.
2,Tiny bit too small,"Similar to other reviewers experiences, these were just a bit too small and are unusable for me.Kind of disappointing."
2,BE WARNED. THIS IS $5 ONLY FOR ONE PAIR.,"I thought, jeez 5 dollars that should be at least 2 pairs.No, it was just one pair.How overpriced.Be warned guys."
1,Why 2 not 4,"With this order everyone knows that with 2 dumbells you get two small bars.The other thing everyone needs to know, is that this is a package put together by Amazon. You would think they would have checked all this out at the time the componenets were being coupled into a package deal????That would mean that I would need 4 Spring Clips Not 2.Doesn't anyone their workout with free weight???I guess the bottom line is they owe me two spring clamps???After I rec'd the order I went to www.amazon.com to write them a note to see how I/They could fix this, there was no way to get in touch with someone with a pulse(no phone), or way to e-mail a problem?? THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT ONCE.M"
3,Did not fit,"I bought it with my finger cross, hope-ing it could fit my threaded dumbell bar.And true enough it did not fit any of my my 1"" diameter bar.Plus it's too tight to squeeze it through the bar.I guess it only fit the brand's own barbells.Gonna return it."
2,Bummer,"Got these for a barbell that to my eye measured exactly one inch. Wouldn't fit. So I tried them on a pair of dumbells with those idiotic spinlocks, which tend to come loose in the middle of a set, but again no go.As if that wasn't annoying enough, the packaging seemed designed to foil all mortal attempts to open it. Had to hack it open with a knife!"
5,Fits Bowflex Bar!!!!,"Exactly what I was looking for. Fit my Bowflex bars perfectly, I use my Bowflex bar to lift weights, so these spring collars were needed to hold weights in place. Perfect for that, if you are looking for the similar application."
1,did not fit,and when they fit they were loose. i would stay away from these. did not like these at all. look at the ones from Cap. Much better fitting in my opinion
2,spring collars,"maybe I am a puss, but you have to pinch these things pretty much all the way closed to get them on the bar. The more weight I put on and the deeper into my workout I don't even like putting them on, I would recommend the ones with screw tight fasteners instead."
5,Great Purchase,"I agree with other comments that the collars fit tight, but they do the job that is needed. Great prodcut and fast shipping."
1,Do Not Buy list,"First of all, I seldom write any reviews, but this time I feel I have to. I bought these collars intended for my assortment of dumbell and barbell bars (approx. 1 inch in diameter -- yes, they are not exactly 1 inch) thinking they should still work somehow. But I was wrong and now they are totally useless. The point I want to make is specifically that with today's popularity of bars that you can ""screw"" a collar on type. These collars will simply not fit your bars at all. Besides, you need to be extremely strong with your hands to squeeze open these collars. So, the warning is: if you have these kind of bars, then DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Save your money. Hope this helps!"
1,Absolutely useless...,"I've never written a review on any product before, ever...but I was so disappointed by this, that I had to say something...Without question the biggest waste of $8.00 I have ever spent. They advertise this product is supposed to speed up your work out and allow for quick changes as needed. Don't be fooled. They are difficult and clumsy to work with, even on a standard 1"" bar. You are better off spending the extra $15 or so, for a better mouse trap."
1,Larry's lost the Light,"I have all McMurtry's books and was excited to receive his latest pre-ordered from amazon.com. What a disappointment; still can't believe it. The Light is gone from the characters AND the plot line. Sad day when McMurty defaults to the tired theme of old, depresssed, lazy man meets young educated hard-working beautiful woman (and a VIRGIN no less!) who serves the old fart devotedly while he offers little (nothing) in return. Sorry state when a famous and well-loved author defaults to word for word description of a porn video to fill up pages under the guise that the old fart is educating the accomplished young thing who has a sex hang up. Don't waste your time or your money on this.... unless you're an old man who needs to keep the myth alive in his own mind."
2,Don't encourage him,"Larry McMurtry can turn out wonderfully written compelling fiction. However, he can also some pretty mediocre work. This book falls into the latter category. It's OK for an airplane book if there's nothing better to read, but only just. Don't encourage him. Re-read ""Lonesome Dove"". Larry, where's the sequel to ""Sin Killer""?"
2,A rather disappointing piece of work,"Mr. McMurtry appears to have co-authored this 172 page pornography pamphlet with Larry Flynt of Hustler Magazine.Our hero, Duane, has reached the age of 64. Duane realizes that the 26 year old virgin that works for him simply cannot wait to loose her virginity to him. First paragraph of page one: ""WOW! LOOK AT THOSE TWO!"" referring to her own stiffening nipples.Our author, at age 72, is living his life vicariously through Duane and the sex scenes are of such graphic nature that they are simply an exercise in using the 'thirty' most dirty words in the English language over and over...... page after page.Yes, Larry, all 26 year old virgins are hot hot hot after your body! Now do go and take a cold shower and GROW UP!It's too bad that one of the best American authors has stepped onto the road of senility."
1,Disappointing Drivel,"Kept thinking ""at least it's short...."" So sad to see a fabulous writer reduced to such cheap tricks. I actually was repulsed by McMurty's reducing all of his best traits as a writer into some kind of MAD magazine caricature of a McMurty book. Save your money and your pysche."
1,Ugh.,"Duane's Depressed was such a beautiful book. I should have stopped there. While reading When the Light Goes, I kept calculating how many pages I had until the end - I didn't know how McMurtry was going to dazzle me in the last few pages. Oh... He didn't. Yes, I agree - Skip this book - and read one of his other, wonderful tales."
5,TYPICAL McMURTRY,Very good read. Am proud owner of all Mcmutry's books. Since I am in the same age group as Duane I can relate to him quite a lot.Pete
1,soft porn,"This book was nothing more than soft porn. How did I get sucked into this one. And, yes, I meant the double entendre."
2,Basically soft porn...,"I give this book two stars only because I wanted to see how McMurty would tie up this saga. However, the relationship between Duane and Anne is just silly, as is much of their dialogue. The graphic sexual descriptions are really all this book has going for it. They are unnecessary to the story and frankly grossed me out a little. I wonder if McMurtry knows that most women don't have orgasms from intercourse alone....could be a big part of his (or Duane's) problem."
5,C'etait bien,"This one cut says it all, & is worth the price of the album. I'm sending a copy each to 2 Parisian friends who play the accordeon."
5,Practical street info!,Would recommend this to anyone who has had to cycle in the streets in an urban area. Very practical advice of things and situations I had never even thought of. A must read for cyclists
4,If you want to dive into urban cycling this is your book,"I hope it is released in Kindle soon. Many people are afraid of using the bike for commuting purposes because they believe the streets are dangerous, the motorists are trying to kill cyclists, etc., specially in other countries such as mine: Mexico. The reality is that motorists and cyclists do not have enough urban culture to share the road appropriately but it isn't that unsafe if you use proper technich and common sense. This book is full of it. I have been a bike commuter in Mexico City for a long time and never had an incident in which I thought that I was about to die or never thought that the surrounding motorists, public transport, taxis, etc., were trying to kill me. If you follow basic safety measures and excercise common sense urban cycling is probably the most fluent way to find your way in any big and crowded city. This book shows you how, read, learn and ride!"
3,Different Bent,"This CD is by a metal band called Bent from the USA, not the same dynamic duo from the UK that authored ""Programmed to Love"" and ""The Everlasting Blink""."
3,Beautiful but not what I wanted...,"This is certainly a visually beautiful book. And, for many people new to Dreamweaver, it might be exactly what they're looking for. Unfortunately, it's not what I am looking for. For example, there are beautiful illustrations of website home pages throughout the book. What I would have liked to have seen is how to create THOSE websites step-by-step. How do you create those attractive banners? How do you create those entire-page-backgrounds? What I want is a book that visually shows me beautiful websites, then shows me how to create them...from basic index.html page and interesting graphics incorporated onto the page, to linked pages, animations (flash) etc. This book just doesn't do it."
1,"Too much visual, not enough explanation",I agree with a previous reviewer that this is certainly a visually apealing book and this is why purchased it. The trouble is that although the pictures are good the explanations are rreally poor and I am no wiser now about how to develop a web page than I was before before I bought the book. All of the writers efforts have gone into designing a visually apealing book rather than a usefull guide to using Dreamweaver.
2,"Oh, please","Dotcha just love people who, after living in a place for a short while, presume to pronounce upon its mores and morals in an incredibly arrogant fashion? Ya do? You'll love this book, then."
4,"Well written, funny, useful","The author has a nice turn of phrase, and a lovely sense of humor. But better yet, I found that it made my trip more enjoyable by putting a few things in context. I certainly wouldn't have recognized the poetry on my B&B door as coming from a beloved Quebecois poet without reading this book; or understood why TV sitcom writers enjoy enough prestige to have a little local shrine of newspaper articles dedicated to them."
5,Surprised by Truth 3,"I have read the books Surprised by Truth 1 & 2 and I wanted to continue reading about these amazing stories of people discovering the Truths about the Catholic Church. This book, though much more profound in words than the first two books, continued my journey in understanding why people are searching, and how they are searching, to discover the Truth, which has been leading them to ""come home"". I end up having a couple of stories from each of the books that are my favorite and can identify with, but also, some stories have really challenged me to read what they have read to make my own discoveries about the Catholic Church. Born and raised a Catholic, and attending Catholic elementary school, I have never left the Church, but I want to learn more about the Catholic Church, her teachings and her Traditions, that the converts have taught me so much that I feel like a neophyte with all the converts as my teachers!"
1,Very disappointed,"I couldn't wait till this book came out but after reading it I wish I would have saved my money. It lacks any convincing arguments that the other two books contained. Atleast one or two of the stories in this book have been circulated all over the internet so much I practically knew them by heart before I read them. Plus, the story by the lawyer is so dry and impersonal it read like an apologetics text book.Patrick, WHAT happened????"
5,A Must for Catholics and Prospective Catholics,Like the first two - this is a very moving book. Born Catholics will be amazed at how difficult it is to make the final step. Moving and inspiriational.
1,More like a college term paper.,"I originally bought the book based on the reviews here. The book is almost completely devoid of substance. I have read every single concept in much better books, except the one on self promotion, which basically says if you have nothing to offer, promote yourself and you might still succeed. It is interesting that the most positive reviews seem to be from people who know the authors. Don't make the same mistake I made looking only at the first few reviews. Be sure to read all of them, and don't bother with this book."
2,Uninformative.,"To be fair, there are a couple of interesting tidbits of information in this book, but overall, there is very little to be learned.The authors go on at length using their ad firm's (KB&P) previous successful campains as learning examples, or case studies, but there is nothing revealing or earth-shattering in their message.Save your money, and instead, pick up books written by Al Ries & Jack Trout, Paco Underhill, Jay Conrad Levinson, or David Ogilvy."
3,I'm not sure...,"I'm really not sure how I felt about this book. They did a great job of detailing the process of composing effective ads. They also developed some really good examples of advertising that gets results. I guess what bothers me is how shameless the writers are. First of all, this book might as well be a brochure for their agency...since all they do is brag about how creative their ideas are. Second of all, it seems as if they are guiltless about the seductive powers of advertising. But like I said...this book swings both ways. People who are cynical about the business will hate this book. People who are shameless will treasure it. And then there's people like me who can't figure out which end is up. So I did the best thing I could think of...I gave the book away. Good luck."
2,Don't waste your money on this one.,"Save your money. This piece of shameless self promotion contains little new information about consumers. Don't waste your time, unless you're interested in knowing how the authors created some mediocre ads. Subscribe to American Demographics instead."
3,Pretty good book for the consumer.,"I borrowed this book from a friend in the ad business. It's pretty good in that it shows how 'they' try to influence 'our' buying decisions. Now when I shop, I think twice before I purchase something. Thanks!"
1,Who are these...?,"If the level of writing and thinking is any indicator of the brains behind this agency, they should close within six months.Shallow, insubstantial fluff from case studies of quite inconsequential and mostly invisible clients.Most case studies in this book were entirely under everyone's radar.Who the hell are Kirschenbaum and Bond anyway?A book by nobodies about advertising? If they'd done something of note, maybe a book would be in order. Noteably, AdWeek published this vanity piece- no one outside of a very small circle of advertising people could possibly care what's in this book."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was enthralled with the music in the movie, and was, therefore, extremely disappointed to find only a few of the songs on the soundtrack. The ""soundtrack"" was loaded with ""bonus tracks"" with were not in the movie at all. They were also not even in the same mood. The most disappointing part about the soundtrack, however, was its omission of the most important song in the movie. ""The Way You Look Tonight"" was featured prominently in the film and performed by the actual cast. Imelda Staunton sings the lead, and Hugh Laurie plays the piano. Both are talented artists, yet this song was omitted from the soundtrack. There is nothing wrong with the songs included on the album, but why bother to call it the soundtrack from ""Peter's Friends""? It's just another 80's collection."
2,disappointed II,"I have to agree with the music fan from TN--I wanted the album for the incredible rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""--would have paid full price for that song alone....but alas,it's not on the album."
3,Recommended for Gordimer fans,"I have read several of Gordimer's novels so I was prepped to like this book and I did. I learned a lot about South African politics and also appreciated her novels more, after having received some context for them. My only real caveat is that essays of these type can seem dated rather quickly, especially when they concern an area of such great political flux, and may seem difficult or irrelevant to some."
4,Convenience of Semi Soft Case,Looks very elegant and has comfortable straps. The battery pack when connected seems to be bit odd for the style. But over all ease of operation is good. Worth the price.
4,"If you can find it, buy it!","It's too bad that this book is no longer published. While it's a bit dated, it's still the only reference available in book form and is *much* easier to read than the actual RFC's themselves. It would be great if the author/publisher updated this book, or another publisher did a similar project. I have found the book to be invaluable."
5,Works well,This works just fine in my truck. Easy to install. Every thing was included in the package that i needed
2,broken flag staffs,3 of the 6 flags had broken staffs----cheap plastic and shipped in an envelope with bubble wrap
4,Tracklist/Info Rubble #7 PICTURES IN THE SKY,PICTURES IN THE SKY Seventh Rubble compilation of mid-60's British psychedelic music from the Pye label Pye was known as the home of the Kinks and Donovan but they also housed some short lived psych groups TRACKLIST The Orange Seaweed - Pictures in the Sky The Glass Menagerie - You Didn't Have to be so Nice Orange Machine - Real Life Permanent Dream Carnaby - Jump and Dance New Formula - Harekrishna The Onyx - So Sad Inside The Flying Machine - The Flying Machine The Primitives - You Said The Onyx - You Gotta Be With Me The Ivy League - My World Fell Down The Epics - Blue Turns to Grey Factotums - Cloudy Koobas - Better Make Up Your Mind Erky Grant and the Earwigs - I'm a Hog For You The Primitives - Help Me Velvett Fogg - Within the Night
2,Not so great,These are not so great quality. You are better off with the Yonex plastic shuttles or else get better feather shuttles.
1,Poor quality shuttlecocks,Recently I bought a dozen of shuttlecocks and the feathers break of easily and it won't last even one game. I won't recommend this to anyone.
4,Not-so-yellow Shuttlecocks,"I received a hand-written note in my shipment saying that the shuttlecocks aren't as yellow as they appear online, and that if I wanted to return them, that would be fine. However, that would have been good information for the seller to post ONLINE or to send in an email BEFOREHAND instead of having me pay for them, wait for them to arrive, and then have to consider how much of a hassle it would be to return them versus keeping them and making do. I found this relatively irritating.The shuttlecocks are nice but are a PALE yellow, and they visually disappear into the foliage in my back yard when airborne.....which was why I was attempting to buy neon yellow ones."
5,"Finally, a compass to guide us through these markets!","Chuck Carlson knows how to weather these stormy markets. He explains why even the most appealing stocks may not be right for everyone's portfolio and shows in clear, well-written ways -- how to buy and hold and build a portfolio that will make profits in the up markets as well as these downturns we have all been hurt by.Some of this book's strategies presented coincided with my own: start investing ASAP, dont confuse investing with trading, buy only stocks and stock mutual funds, invest every month, buy and hold. The book also warns you about the common mistakes investors make and how to avoid them. Ultimately, he shows through many examples that slow and steady wins the race....this book was a great investment...Im even buying copies for my friends in my investment club."
2,paperback stories,Literary content was wonderful. Book started to fall apart as I read it. One of the worst reading copies I ever bought.
4,A useful book...,"This book is a useful addition to anyone who wants to improve his/her swimming. I wish the author had spent a little more time on back, breast, and fly. Some drills and workouts for these strokes would be helpful."
2,Very uncomfortable,"These boots are extremely uncomfortable. I am tall and wear a size 11, so I ordered an 11.5. While I expect to have to break in new shoes, especially boots, the awkward height dug into my shin with every step.Perhaps they would've been more comfortable over time, but I expected more of $70 boots."
1,Stiff as a Board,This boot is impossible for my daughter to slip on her foot even with a zipper. It has zero flexability. It is also very clunky and heavy.
3,They are ok but not my favorite boots.,"I liked the color and style, but the boots are hard to get on. Especially the left foot for some reason for me. They are also a lot wider than I expected. They are comfortable and my feet are warm and dry when I wear them, but are a bit bulkier than I expected."
3,Not good on ice,The reviews said that these were stiff and I agree but you have to break them in a bit. Also the zipper doesn't stay up and I can't wear wool socks with these but I think they are very warm anyway. I wore them this morning and I was walking and I fell on the frosty sidewalk. They have no traction so I know i can't walk on anything but a clear sidewalk and snow. I am going to go ice my hip now :(
