2,Good study in the fundy mindset,"I was one of the (idiots) that bought into this back in 1988. At the moment, there is one seller for $50.00. I'd kinda like to have it for posterity, though, I might want to find it for cheaper."
3,Quick,"My review is brief to match this book. And that is not necessarily a bad thing. I have read all of PKD's novel and short stories and another person's views are always of interest to me. But I suspect that a reader who does not know PKD's work well may find this book more confusing than stimulating. I would also have liked more of the short stories to have been discussed - some of the great stories not yet made into movies, plays or operas.And finally, in a critical analysis like this I would have liked some explanation of how Mr Butler determined his ratings, and I would also have liked some considered opinion as to why PKD has such a great following that far exceeds, apparently in number and reputation, such other SF stalwarts as Simak, van Vogt, Asimov and Heinlein. And does PKD have a reputation outside SF that these other authors do not?"
2,What a great idea!,"I was looking for a bike with some sort of help when climbing hills and imagine my delight on finding this Schwinn electric bike posted on Amazon. I read the reviews which seemed excellent but nothing prepared me when I received the shipment that this bike was strictly a young boy's bike - I should have known that 20"" wheels were not for my size but it sounded such a great deal, if I had been a midget it would have been!! Also, who would ever think of giving a young kid an electric bike. The worse thing is that it would cost me as much to ship it back to the makers for what I paid for it so I am stuck with it. I told the manufacturers they should make an adult version which I think would sell like hot cakes in this gas guzzling society.ME."
3,Good general introduction to F&A,"If you want a very basic introduction into the world of finance and accounting, this book may be for you. I was a little disappointed at the lack of depth, though."
3,Made the course tollerable,"I dreaded the finance class to be honest, but the book made the class understandable. Without it I would have been utterly lost."
3,A fascinating story,"I read Marg's story after a visit to Petra. She is definitely a special person to have adopted the bedouin lifestyle so completely.I enjoyed reading of the places we visited as tourists, but this time seeing them through a resident's eyes. I also met her son, Raami, who was educated in Jordan, Australia & New Zealand, but still works in the souvenir stand when he is in Petra. Reading her book widened my view of Petra and of the bedouins who no longer live in the caves there, but have been relocated to a settlement nearby.I would like to have read the book before visiting Petra."
1,The book never showed up and I haven't been reimbursed!,I ordered the book around Nov. 29. It never showed up. I received two apologetic letters but have yet to be reimbursed. I'm furious.
3,visit Petra,"having just returned from Jordan and seeing Petra, I was intrigued by the book and the author's true life experiences. The writing was a bit weak, but the story was interesting. The stark conditions of the area she lived and raised children in is very real and I commend her for her bravery."
3,"Quirky--different, one woman's life in a very 3rd world","Having lived in Latin America for over 18 years--I know a little about 3rd world (or to be PC, developing world). While on a visit to Petra, I saw this book--thought about buying it, but went to library for it. Glad I did. Though it is interesting, and has moment that are fascinating--mostly I kept wondering why. Why anyone would choose to live in the stone age, or close to it. But given I believe in diversity of choices--this woman had a LOT of chutzpah and gumption. If you've always wondered--what if? Give it a whirl."
4,A love story,"This is what you can call it, love. I am from Jordan and story started in 1978 and I know how life was difficult on that time on Petra, the only explanation is love. A woman that give up everything just to be with someone she love.East reading and fun sometimes."
3,Enjoyable,"Enjoyed reading it but it wasn't a ""story"" as such. Still gives you a bit of an insight in her life with the Bedouin."
1,So boring and no passion or emotion!,"I am still trying to trudge through this book. It makes an interesting title as this woman definitely chose an alternate lifestyle. However, the book is full of dull minutiae that is just not interesting. She writes with virtually no passion or emotion so it has been very difficult for me to pick the book up and read it for any length of time. Not sure I'll be able to finish it. So painful just to try to get through a few pages at a time. I have read many books about the Middle East and real life accounts of people experiencing the culture in this part of the world ( I am a westerner who has lived and worked in Qatar for 5 years now) and this book just doesn't work for me."
5,Marriet to a Bedouin,"Having just returned from Petra, I found this a very interesting account of life with the Bedouins. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
2,"Honestly, I had higher expectations","I've only heard rave reviews of this book and was strongly encouraged to read it since I would be spending an extended period in Jordan. I think my expectations were too great. I had hoped to learn more about Bedouin traditions and culture and how a Westerner became a part of the society. I'm not a scholar of the Middle East, Arab, or Bedouin historty/tradition, but there was little information that was new for me. I found the book to be poorly organized, lacking of structure, and repetitive. Except for a few ""chapters"" when the author truly opened up to the reader, I felt as if I were reading a list of items from a day planner. From the anecdotes, it's clear Ms. Van Geldermalsen (Umm Salwa wa Umm Raami) led a rich life and experienced much that most of us will never know. I simply wish she had a better editor."
3,nice love story,Nice love story. Would have liked to have heard a bit more about how she & kids are now. Would also like to know what she thought about 9/11...
2,Not a literary piece,"Interesting topic, especially since we had just visited Petra, but the writing so uninspiring that I lost interest very quickly."
2,"Very Informative, just not to the point.",Mr. Boulter's research as described in this book is one of the most interesting and encompassing I have ever encountered. The findings relating to biological evolution (rate of evolution and self organized system characteristics) are very important and intriguing findings. However the book is not to the point in my opinion. It is too descriptive of things that are not relevant to the topic. In fact you can easily eliminate 80 pages from this book and still leave the main argument unchanged and understandable.
3,Beginning of Woman,"This book is about the end of Man, but what about the end of Woman? I'm confused. Will Woman survive when Man is extinct? It's an interesting prospect, but highly unlikely. My point is that sexist language is never excusable, especially in a sophisticated book like this one. Male authors, editors and publishers will do themselves and the rest of the world a big favor when they stop calling humans ""men."""
4,Evolution and the end of Man,"I enjoyed this book as an extra to previous books I had read on evolution, especially Richard Fortey's 'Life'. Mr Boulter details the effects of continental drift in the evolution of species in a much more regarding manner than many other writers. And the book does detail an analytical method that suggests not only that evolution and change are inevitable, but also so is extinction. Inevitably it will come to humankind in its turn - or will it? Perhaps evolution will cause change rather than extinction just as it is now believed many dinosaurs - rather than dying out - changed to become birds. So the message of the book is not necessarily gloomy even though it does talk of the 'end of Man'."
2,"Rushed Playing, Not My Favorite Bach","There is a deeply spiritual quality in Bach's music, that brings me closer to heaven every time I listen. This quality is present with such abundance in the Bach of the elderly Arrau and Kempff, that the music reached deeply into my soul and put me into tears at time.IMHO, it takes a very refined sense of control to balance the multiple voices in Bach's polyphonic keyboard music. On one hand, each line needs to be given its due independence and prominence, and yet, at the same time, together they should sound ""at peace"" with one another harmonically. Hewitt's playing is usually muddy in the bass lines (as compared to the clarity achieved by Glenn Gould, Arrau or Kempff, the latter two even did it on unmodified pianos). Hewitt's playing also lacks the fore-mentioned finesse control, that caused the louder passages to sound ""noisy"" and ""nervous"". Also, while her phrasing is usually very good, her shaping may be considered overdone for Baroque keyboard music."
1,Light music Bach,"Refinement and elegance of her playing is pretty impressive at first hearing, but this is not the kind of performance I want to come back repeatedly. It's matter of personal taste, but for me Bach should be played with much depth and sense of awe. Maybe I'm too old fashioned, but whatever she plays sounds like light music and as if something is missing despite all the praises heaped upon by critics."
1,unable to review,I never received the items in this order. Post office refused to deliver. I'd love to review these CD's because I needed them for my business. This is difficult to do when the post office refuses to deliver. I signed the delivery receipt requesting the package be redelivered and it was never delivered to my home.
2,sad,I love the idea of this book. I found that the words were a little hard for the beginning reader and it went to fast to figure out the words. I like the story.
3,Knights of Cydonia,I was disappointed that this only had 2 songs on it! I didn't even know that they made CD's with only one or two songs on them. I ordered it for my son for Christmas. Read the fine print is all I've got to say!
5,THIS IS GREAT,This sheet music is great. My husband loves to sing and to play the piano. This sheet music is fabulous.
3,don't seem to last longer,"I've been using these batteries in my computer's mouse, and they don't seem to last longer. Of course, this is a totally subjective response. I have not actually measured times."
5,Essential to keep our new generations in touch with the past,"""Essential to keep our new generations in touch with the past. Basic cooking, easy to read, simple in concept and has been a foundation for preparing ethnic food for our children and children's children. Thanks to Helen Corey for keeping a link to our roots and family values. Book recipes puts Big Mac's to shame!!"
3,Cru-Saddle Sore,"I enjoy Severin's smooth prose style and didn't find this book hard going at all as a bedside table read. I would recommend it as a true life adventure rather than a history, however, because Severin does a poor job in blending the historical facts of the First Crusade with his experiences in retracing Duke Godfrey's path to Jerusalem. For the most part, he alternates a little history with a lot of travel details--heavy on the shoeing, feeding, and dealing with saddle sores. Note to the squeamish: chapter 21 has an especially colorful description of a pony's wounds and their treatment. Severin had little experience with horses prior to this journey and in spite of a more knowledgeable companion, the horses seem to have suffered because of it. I imagine that any horseloving reader would be pretty appalled. Two more notes: the book needs maps, and Phoenix Press needs better proofreaders (there were at least a dozen typos in my soft cover edition)."
5,Thanks for taking me with you!--I felt like I was there.,Great service on the book. Although I'm not to Jerusalem yet...I'm loving every page. It's especially captivating for animal lovers and riders who enjoy the horses as much as the people in the book. Wonderful experience.
5,Safe bed rail,"Arrived on time and was as good, or better that I thought it was. Easy to install. Provides protection from old fools falling off bed."
2,Could have been built better,"Its hard to see exactly what you are getting on the internet when it comes to objects not commonly used everyday. This is no exception. I thought this product was going to be sturdier. The thing that goes around the mattress is actually a cord (a giant rubber band). So the bar even when properly assembled can be wobbly if enough weight is applied to it. I pray that it can hold my father especially if he pulls on it for support. If this cord was a flat steel bar that reached across the mattress and bent down with a hook at the end to grip the bottom of the bed frame, just the sheer weight of the mattress and the grip on the bed frame as a counterbalance would have made this barrier 10X sturdier. I bought this product because I am not sure what else is out there. This certainly isn't the best thing in the world. Just a compromise."
2,Bed Rail OK,The package was missing a key piece that had to be sent separately. The directions were incorrect which made it confusing to assembly especially since I didn't know I was missing a part. Works as described.
4,Good Rail and Grab Bar,"Yes the Rail does go tilt and down. Make sure that you look at the knobs used to release the bed rails from the upright position. They rotate 90 degrees and lock open. This can cause problems if you are not aware of it because the rail could be unstable with only one lock engaged or partiality engaged. Check this carefully.There are release buttons on the TOP of the bed rails that have to be pushed in to allow the rails to extend or retract. You can push and pull all day, but these buttons must be pushed in to move the rails.The strap used to stabilize the rail is really needed. You must make this as tight as possible. My mother's mattress is on a plywood platform and we used conduit clamps to add stability.Overall this Grab bar/Rail works well to help her in and out of bed and keep her from falling out.Assembly was not difficult and it came with the Allen Wrench you needed."
3,So-so stability,"Fits well under matress and easy to adjust height, but the handle wobbles no matter how much tighten nut/bolt which can make a user feel less secure."
3,Flimsy,It's okay. It works. I don't know how long it will last. Every time I use it I hear it make cracking noises. I like the handle but the base is flimsy.
4,Pretty good,"I only used this for a few days after my abdominal surgery, but it was very helpful. Make sure you have a strong upper body to use this product. Overall, pleased with the product."
4,More Secure for her/ Better sleeping for me!!!,"Though I still sleep with one eye open, it much more restful know that Mommy won't fall out of the bed at might.She is only 4""9 so we haven't needed to open it any farther yet. She likes it because it still gives her mobilityat night and folds down during the day, just as advertised. Thanks agains for the consideration of seniors. At 86they are not going to do anything new, only what they have always done!! Be as Independent as possible!!!Thanks againLorene"
5,Great for safety,Easy to install. Added safety while sleeping and helps when getting out of bed. Folds down to make bed. Ajusts to fit length of mattress.
4,Good value,"Bought this for my wife to keep her from falling out of bed at night. This works. The adjustable length is a handy feature. The strap attchment to the bed frame could be better, as the rail does wobble somewhat, but overall it does the job. You would pay a lot more for this same product at Walgreens!"
4,Grab Bar,We are pleased with this purchase. Our 87 year old mother is now able to get in and out of bed easily with this grab bar. Installation was easy. Thank you.
3,Bed Rail comments,"We purchased these bed rails for my grandma who is prone to falling out of bed. Aside from this her health conditions are minimal. Based on the video provided for the product we jumped at the chance to purchase the item. Once we received it, we were immediately disappointed. Though it does prevent my grandma from falling out of bed, she is unable to operate the push button rail system, which was ""left out"" of the demo video. Additionally, it is near impossible to lower the rail system once you are in bed, even when i tried it for myself. Because of this, it has made things much more difficult for her as she cannot shorten the rail to get in or out of bed or lower the rail to get in or out of bed.I suppose the purpose is to keep her in the bed at night, which it has. However, the bottom line is if anyone has arthritis pain or weak hands, they will not be able to operate the slide rail."
4,Great item,Bought this for my dad for his safety. It's a great product and gives us a sense of safety when he is in bed. He likes using it as a support to get in and out of bed. Only one issue and this is the knobs for the pulldown. Doesn't seem to lock in as secure as it should . . . maybe I need to take apart and put it back together again. Definitely an item to consider for older parents!
3,We thought the bed cane was awesome until my mother nearly hung herself on it,"I bought the bed cane for my mother who has Parkinson's. We thought it was awesome until she nearly hung herself on it. She slid off the bed and got her head caught under the hooked side. Luckily I heard her before she suffocated. Also, the rail was very loose and wobbly when we first installed it. We replaced the pins that came with it with thicker bolts to make it more steady. It did serve its purpose, helping my mother get in and out of bed on her own, but it also nearly killed her."
2,Missing end cap on pivot rail,"This product would have worked well if it had been complete. There was no end cap on the head of the bed side of the pivot rail which we did not realize until after it was assembled. This made the bedrail very unstable and unable to be securely locked into position. We ended up cutting a piece of pvc pipe to fit because of the urgent need for the bedrail due to several recent falls, otherwise it would have been returned."
4,Poor quality control,This is my second bedcane I have purchased. The first one was fine and I would give it a 5 star as it works better than I expected. The second one gets a 4 star as the holes were not completely drilled out for the bolt. I had to complete drilling out the bolt hole with my drill Other than than that it works as good as the first one.
1,Standers bed cane,I purchased this device to help my parent get up and out of bed. She has parkinsons and very little arm and leg strength. I thought that it would help her to pull herself up in bed as well as to stand up when getting out. Her strength is so poor that it did her no good at all. I would certainly recommend it for anyone who is strong enough to use it. In my parents case it is useless....
4,Love this device.,"I bought this device, installed it, and it works great. The nice thing is that it appears very stable and doesn't take up much room, which is what you want in a device like this."
4,Helpful,Railing gives us peace of mind with my elderly father since he fell out of bed before we purchased. Easy to install and use
4,Easy to install,"My Mother-In-Law's physical therapist recommended this item. We purchased it from Amazon due to cost savings. The bed-cane arrived in few days, was easy to install and has helped my Mother-In-Law immensely. She is able to get out of bed easily."
4,Just what we needed,"This bed rail is just what we needed. Very well made and not all ""hospital"" looking like the chrome ones we've seen. The only issues we had are the noise when extending the rails and the fit to a lower bed/mattress.Telescoping the tubes out to extend the rail is noisy in a scaping, screeching way. If the person in bed is just falling asleep this could be troublesome. We plan to investigate some sort of lubrication, possibly contacting the manufacurer.The bed we put it on has a fairly low box spring, so the rail doesn't fold all the way down. It touches the floor just short of vertical. Also, because the mattress is thin, the top of the assembly when folded down is more likely to get in the way geting in & out of bed. We plan to buy a new bed soon, so this is not really much of an issue and certainly not a problem with the design of the product."
2,I made it work anyway,"If the rails went together as the directions show, this thing would be OK. However, the strap that is supposed to reach between the box spring and the mattress is fabricated in a way making it impossible to actually assemble that part of the product. You will just give up and make a knot around the bed frame and feel really mystified by the ""easy"" videos or the printed instructions. Don't worry, its not you..... its a design flaw of the first order. If someone in Quality Control had tried to put this thing together he/she would have seen the error. The Y belt around the rail's frame has a misplaced and permanently sewn plastic connector so you can't use it to adjust or connect to the other plastic connector. Best guess is the factory in China had the drawings sent from a broken fax machine."
1,Don't Buy this!,"I bought this for my mother who Is in a hospital bed. She moves around In her sleep and ends up half on and half off the bed most nights. This rail is flimsy, has no real support and is dangerous."
4,king size bed,"This is an excellent piece of equipment. For a king-size bed, the strap is not really workable, but the weight of the mattress holds the cane in place fine. It certainly has helped my husband getting in and out of bed since his stroke."
5,Works Perfectly,"I bought this for my mother who is 81. This works very well, is sturdy and easy to put into place. This is just what we needed to keep her safe."
4,Helps me in getting up from bed,I have trouble getting up from bed. This helps me at least be upright then swing my legs around to the side of the bed. One has to have a reasonably good upper body strength to pull oneself up with this contraption. An added bonus would be to increase one's upper body strength with it's constant use.
1,Shipping rip off,"Needed this and other items BEFORE my father returned home from a long stay at a rehab facility. When ordering, items were to ARRIVE at my home address by a specific date. Now, we are two days PAST that date and still no products. I paid Amazon LLC extra for 2 day shipping. What did I get? Nothing. Disappointed and will look elsewhere when I need somehting in a timely manner."
4,Bed rail review,"Did not need after all but despite our sudden change in the need for a bedrail, it was sent in a very timely manner and although the refund has not been completely processed, it is being processed as promised."
2,Stinky BedCaddie,A little confusing since there are 4 different items for sale in this listing. These comments refer only to the Standers BedCaddie.If you can get past the heavy smell emanating from rubber hand grips then this product might work well. But the smell was so strong that we never got the chance to give it a fair test. Even after airing it out for a week the smell never went away. Couldn't imagine leaving it on the bed for my wife to use...the smell was overpowering!It's been Returned.
5,bed safety,This item is better than I expected. Easy to install and gives me a pocket to hold cell phone and eyeglasses plus any reading material I might want at hand. Very secure night time feeling.
2,Does not anchor to bedframe with stability,"Although it appears well made and is easy to assemble, it has a poor attachment system for anchoring to the bedframe. When my mother tested it by lying in bed and grabbing the rail to pull herself to an upright position, the entire bedrail system shifted toward her. It is unstable, moves forward, backward, and shifts around easily. The strap system going under the bed simply provides no proper anchoring at all. If you can figure out how to attach it with stability to the bedframe, it will probably work, but I don't want to spend 5 hours and countless trips to the hardware store to resolve what is, essentially, a poor design idea."
2,not very helpful,"In order to use this item, one must pull up on the nearest handle that is between the two surgical tubing bands and then reach for the next handle in order to work your way up. Takes too much strength to do that and does not offer stability while you are doing so."
5,Good Quality,"Purchased this for my father who is in a retirement home, to assit him getting in and out of bed. Very sturdy. My father just loves it, he can't say enough about it."
4,OK Product,"We got this product for my Dad, who suffered from a massive stroke. Though the concept works fine, it really didn't work for my Dad, as his strength in his unaffected arm wasn't enough to take maximum advantage of this device. Overall though, it is a good product and concept."
1,Didn't fit,Could not attach this to a sleep number bed. Wish description had been clearer so I would know not to buy this.
1,Very disappointed.,Sad to say this Adjust Bed Rail was very hard to install. Then when put into practice this was a disappointment. I was so very disappointed as it was not easy to use at all.
3,Would benefit from a higher percentage extract,"These pills contain 100mg of pygeum extract, at 6.5% phytosterols, and 400mg of pygeum bark.The good:* Cheap.* Doesn't hurt my stomach. If this changes, I'll update the review.The bad:* I believe the sterols content is about half what it should be.* I believe the pygeum bark is just filler.A Medscape page, which summarizes several studies, says, ""The recommended dosage of pygeum, on the basis of the clinical studies, is 100-200 mg of an extract standardized to a 14% content of sterols, including -sitosterol, usually given in two divided doses daily."" Later, it says, ""Dried pygeum bark is occasionally available. It is used in dosages of 5-20 g twice daily. However, the efficacy of the crude bark has not been studied, and the bark is not recommended."""
1,Makes my stomach hurt!,"This is the second brand of pygeum I've used. I had no trouble with the first brand, Nature's Way, but this brand causes me a lot of stomach pain. I've taken it with food and without food, but whether I take two capsules or only one, my stomach ends up hurting for hours."
3,Too short for me.,"I wish they still made the mid-calf length. Even tho I've been careful about not putting these in the dryer, they still seem short. But, to put in perspective, I'm over 6 feet tall."
2,More like a stocking than a sock,"Given what I paid for these I expected a more substantial sock. The material is so thin that you can see light through them and it doesnt need to be a strong light source either. They are ""dress socks"" but they could stand to use a litte more material in their construction."
2,The Best for many Years; Now They Changed Them for the Worse!,"I standardized on Black, Over-Calf, Windsor-Socks, since the 1980s and have purchased them by the dozen since. With my latest purchase the change was immediately obvious. They are much thinner with a rough feel versus the soft, warm (even when wet), thicker standard of so many years. It is too soon to have experienced the full result of the changes. However, based on look, feel, and comfort, I am disappointed."
1,"not really wool, cheap product","it is actually 49% wool and the rest nylon/polyester. Also, doesn't feel like wool and has none of its warmth. It is loosely knitted, and feels like I'm wearing a plastic net over my feet. It is a junky product, keep shopping."
5,Good Wool Socks,"These are very good wool socks. There is some pilling depending on the lining of the shoe, but overall they are warm in winter, and wick away moisture in summer. There is just enough stretch to keep them up on the calf without constricting circulation. BTW, for the person looking for a 100% wool sock, it's probably not the ideal sock, since the small amount of nylon added to the yarn prevents holes from developing in the wool too quickly."
2,Thin and irritating,"I was expecting something with some cushion and some warmth. I have some wool hiking boot socks that i love, and i thought ""Wow! I wonder if i can get a wool dress sock like these."" These Gold Toe's are paper-thin, have no cushion, and have a really irritating toe seam (a standard feature of Gold Toe socks). I returned mine and the search for great dress socks continues..."
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered over the calf but did not receive over the calf socks. Very disappointed.
2,Not particularly helpful,"I did not get a lot out of this book. The largest single section of the book was about breeding cichlids-- there was not a lot of discussion about individual species, compatability, or how a beginning aquariast might be able to start a cichlid aquarium. The book did have some interesting information about cichlids in their native habitat, and a few fun anecdotes/stories. However, as an aquarium neophyte, I found I had little more practical knowledge about keeping cichlids after I read this book than before I started."
2,good?,there was EXTREME water damage and stickers on the book. cover in no good quality.the only good thing about it was that it arrived promplty
1,eView17f2,"worked fine for 13 months, then died. Emachines refused to cover since warranty was only for 12 months. if you buy, better get extended warranty or emachines will not stand behind it."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I like Ali Larter all right, but in this movie, she was such a terror in the beginning that I found it hard to like her in the end. I do love Salman Khan as well.The most disappointing thing about this movie was that it seemed like watered-down Bollywood. Bollywood made for the West. No subtitles, no speaking in Hindi. Except for the musical numbers, and they weren't subtitled for some strange reason. I'm sure there's a market for this kind of Bollywood Light, but for us die-hard Bollywood fans, it's a cheap imitation."
2,mediocre,"MY wife and daughters have enjoyed Bollywood movies for several years, but this formulaic example certainly would not have gotten them interested.The male lead is the only actor who shows any particular skill or craft as a actor, the female lead, while playing a D list actress, really is one, the directing and writing doesn't seem to know when to end a scene - Only if you want a complete unbroken set."
2,Could have been so much better,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it just didn't measure up:What I liked:-the setting in India-the BEAUTIFUL clothes-the dancing-there were lots of funny scenes, mainly the part of the ""movie director"". -choice of lead actor, Salman Khan. Good looking guy, but I have to admit his acting here was very uninspired.What I didn't like:-the juvenile dialogue. It could have been written by a sixth grader! Frankly, this is what ruined the film for me and brought it down to only 2 stars.-choice of lead actress. While I thought Ali Larter did a graat job on Heroes, she just wasn't great here.-there was no chemistry between the lead actor/actress. Their romance was just not believable.I loved the exotic setting, the dancing and the beautiful clothes so much that I'm going to look for a real Bollywood movie to watch. I don't know where to start. Anyone have any suggestions?"
3,"""Like The Flower"" ~ The Seven Stages Of Love","Hollywood meets Bollywood in the '07 film 'Marigold', an enjoyable romp through Bombay starring Indian luminary Salman Khan and American actress Ali Larter. The movie begins rather slowly but as the relationship between Salman and Ali builds you'll find yourself slowly drawn into the storyline. Definitely not a classic but it does provide a solid evening of entertainment with exotic scenery, colorful costumes and music that is pure Bollywood. If you're unfamiliar with Indian films or reading subtitles this English language production will serve as a solid and painless primer on the Indian cinematic experience that may intrigue the audience enough to explore this ever-growing phenomenon further.My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-."
5,very good movie!,"I first saw this film in the cinema and I was very disappointed as it was in dubbed in Ordo with English subtitke!This DVD version is much better as the film was origanaly filmed in English!As for the film itself, if you like a bollywood fantasy then you'll enjoy it very much! It has every thing that you'd expect in a typical bollywood film: romance, drama, dancing, fantastic custumes and scenary and the typical bollywood ending with the wedding ceremony that ends with someone happely giving up his spouse for the hero or heroen!!!Overall a good east meet west movie! With good chemistry between Salman Khan and Ali Larter.The DVD is good but laks subtitles!!"
3,Marigold-A Movie,"It was okay!!! The plot is predictable. The music is great. What dissapointed me terribly was the lack of captions. It was extremely hard to understand. If I had known it didn't have captions I would not have bought this movie. I am very, very sad :("
4,A Great Bollywood/Hollywood crossover,I first saw part of this movie on tv awhile ago and it peaked my interest. Loved how the main character made the best out of a bad situation and ended up becoming a better person in the long run. Also loved her interaction with the people around her and how she took more away for her work experience. Great for light viewing.
4,"Love the vocals, dancing and two thirds of the movie","Could have edited out the over abundance of Ali Lartner being nasty in the beginning of the movie. Hang in there though, the rest makes for a good family story, and a happy ending...like that about the Bollywood movie formula. It's entertainment, and started me looking at viewing other Bollywood films."
1,How can it be possible?,"...For a film to stink on every level; as well as have actors, the director and each element of production at 8th grade degree of ability. Worse than waterboarding. make terrorists watch this excremental offering over and over and by the third showing, they will confess to every crime and act since the quieting of the seas of week one."
5,great movie,I ran into this movie in hollywood video and figured if ali larter was in it that it had to be a great movie. if your into romance and falling in love then this is a great movie. i love bolltwood movies. and also love musicals . this was a great movie for me . its a shame i never could have seen it in a movie theatre it would have been great
4,Bollywood meets Hollywood,It's Bollywood meets Hollywood in this fantastic movie. It has everything you'd expect from a Bollywood musical. It's a story about a Hollywood actress who goes to star in a Bollywood film. What starts off as just another movies role evolves into a life-changing experience that will leave you begging for more.
3,Quirky,"This quirky CD of English ""roots"" music is an odd assortment of different styles of influence on the various artists presented here. There's the raw folksiness of ""Claudy Banks"", the old-timey Victorian feel of ""A Lord Of Steam and Iron"", but the best song of the bunch is a pleasant and breezy folk-pop number ""Sail On By"" by Oysterband, which owes a nod to Steeleye Span's more upbeat tunes. Said song makes the whole album worth it for just that song alone."
2,SHARP EDGES!,"(NOTE: My review is about the smaller 50-pc set of this series.) I just bought this set at a retail store today, intending to supplement an older set of blocks that I had growing up that my kids are now using. Having always had positive experiences with Imaginarium products, I was expecting good quality from this set of blocks. My son and I opened it a few minutes ago, and the blocks are brightly colored and nicely sized...as to be expected from Imaginarium. However, we were quite disappointed to discover that the edges on these things are rather sharp! I compared them to my older set, then decided in a matter of minutes that they are potentially dangerous and will be returned to the store for a refund. I strongly recommend that you do not buy these, unless you have a lot of patience and a lot of sandpaper. Imaginarium, what a disappointment!"
3,Blocks too small,"My boys , ages 4 and 2 1/2, love to build with blocks. After buying a big block set, they would fight because there were not enough pieces to ""share"". So, I purchased this set. However, by viewing the pics, I thought it was bigger size blocks. The photo is deceiving. The blocks are a bit flimsy. A few have chipped from my kids throwing them (typical boy behavior), and they don't balance too well when building big towers. Overall, I guess they are fine, but not what I expected."
4,tire chain towing,Chains were moderately difficult to install but did dramatically improve traction for my 12 hp snapper tractor. In retrospect I would deflate the tires somewhat before installing. The chains did slip on the tires somewhat.
5,one of the best cd's i've ever listened to!!!!!,Classic Hitsthis jim croce cd is an amazing collection of love songs by one of the most popular singer of the 60ies.i highly recommend it!
2,Just a bunch of questions,"I'm sorry, but Ken Foster calls 300 pages of questions a book...you've got to be kidding?! I am a huge self help book fan, but this is ridiculous. It seems like he culled questions from every self help book ever written and threw them into 300 pages of ...you got it...questions to ask yourself!Answering all of these 1001 questions won't lead you to success. There is nothing related to implementation, analysis, tips...nothing but questions that most of us have seen time and time again, but never in one book. Overwhelming and only geared toward self discovery, but not success.Maybe it should be called ""We Ask and You Become Introspective.""If that is what you are looking for, then purchase this book"
5,Better questions lead to better results,"As a psychologist I understand the importance of finding the right questions to help clarify issues. Ken Forster amassed a fortune in great questions! The book is categorized into 38 chapters that focus on the most important issues that we too often do not think about enough. The questions will stimulate anyone to think more, analyze their situation more carefully and reach a higher level of awareness as a result.Some questions really require a well thought out elaborate answer, others can be just a yes or no. The deeper prize one gets going through this book is training your mind to search for the right questions on your own. If you were to actually answer all of the questions, I am sure that process would certainly launch you towards greater success. To put it simply, the basic concept of the book really resonates with me, if you ask, you will receive. Get this book and start answering the questions, you will observe faster progress in your life."
5,"A Simple ""Operations Manual"" for Everyday Living","Ken Foster has given the world a real gem with Ask and You Will Succeed. The true beauty is in the books simplicity, ease of use and application to any area of life. His ""take you by the hand and draw you inward"" approach is remarkably effective at tapping the infinite wisdom, strength and vision we all possess, but so often fail to recognize. In the short time I have owned Ken's book I already find myself referring to it constantly. I suspect there will be many ""dogeared"" pages in this book for all who make the wise choice to obtain it, use it to enhance their lives and tap into the true power they possess within themselves.Rob FighterCEOTheFreeAgentPath.com"
3,"Good, but not great","I felt like this book had a lot of ""words"" ~ I know, don't MOST books have a lot of words??!!! ha! ~ but very little substance. My expectation was for it to be more of a ""roadmap"" to how one would create life changing results and it continued to advise that if you keep asking questions the answers will appear. Which, I don't necessarily agree, but one has to first be in a place to RECEIVE before even thinking about asking a question......it fell short of helping me achieve this....good but not great!"
3,what the doctor may not tell you,"This book is pretty good as far as for a lay person, however I found it to be redundant and non informative for someonewho is in the profession. It would be fine as long as someone wants basic info."
3,Interesting idea executed poorly,"I was very much on board with the idea of a writer giving Kane an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, for a true WWE fan, this book is going to be a bit of a letdown. I like the Katie Vick stuff and how she was an integral part of his life. If you take that, and add it to the storyline the WWE gave us with Lita, it does add depth to the character. But, I think the 'family curse' path the writer went down bogged the story a bit. It was a good read, just not what I was really hoping for when I heard about the book."
1,How many pages will Katie Vick get?,"The review above was clearly written by someone from WWE. Only they are markish enough to write a positive review of the fictional backstory of Kane. If they truly incorporate all the incredibly inconsistent storylines in the Kane angle over the years, the book will be about as compelling as the trainwreck of a product they are now putting out there. I have a feeling they will be dancing around the time they had HHH claim Kane raped a girl named Katie Vick. Hopefully we won't see the following bit of narration in the book:After Kane finished with her, he was terribly sorry. Little did he know that years down the road, in an effort to promote a match with HHH, Hunter would violate a mannikin."
5,"Great Volume, Range and Portability",Excellent product! I bought this to use in noisy public areas. The volume and range are incredible. The name 'Half-Mile Haile' is a very appropriate one. It is also very portable.
2,Rusted out in 6 years,"I purchased these to mount on my 2003 TJ windshield, the first 2 years they worked great but started to rust. My jeep is always hand washed and I even waxed the lights when I waxed my jeep. Within 3 years I noticed rust in the same area on both lights, at 5 years they stopped working (but I kept them installed because I liked the look), and at 6 years I removed them because they split apart from all the rust, also I was tired of scrubbing the rust streaks off my jeep.There was a significant amount of power drain when these lights are running. I am switching to LED for a large reduction in power usage."
4,Good driving lights,"I wanted some good driving lights that were significantly brighter than the high beams on my 2004 nissan frontier. They are brighter than the high beams but not by a whole lot, the main difference is the spread of the beam. These KC's have a much wider beam and make everything on the road or side of road much more visible. Wiring and installation were both pretty basic. Seller shipped the lights very promptly."
4,Now I can see,Great lights but cheep hardware. Easy install and they look great but the main bolt stripped out and I had to buy another one.
4,Floor Console,"Great value for price. Two problems with useage in my 2008 GMS fullsize pickup. Can only open top lid to CD compartment 1/3 of the way because it hits underside of lower dash, I removed lid. Doesnot stay on floor (on top of trans. hump), slides off. I have a work truck with rubber floormat , would be better with carpet. My fix was to use duck tape to hold it in place. Fuctionality is great for the price."
5,Great product!,This console is a great product. Used in an F150. Should be standard for the truck. I have no complaints. Well made. Color matched perfectly.
2,not what I ordered,"The first console I ordered was missing the removable CD/Cassette storage and litter bin. I sent it back and ordered again in the charcoal color. This time, they sent a complete console but it was black. It was a gift and I didn't have time to return it for another one. All that said, it is a nice inexpensive unit if you can get all the parts and in the correct color ordered."
2,I regret buying this item,"This bag is roomy, very cute and at a great price but I regret buying it. It has no restraints or pockets inside for bottles, diapers or wipes. Everything was so jumbled up when I carried it and the bottles would fall over and leak. How hard is it to just put in some elastic to hold the bottles upright? I had to wash the bag out countless times. I finally gave up on it when the end came off the zipper and ruined it for good.If you do buy this please consider buying the travel pod along with it even though it more than doubles the price and still does not guarantee the bottles will stay upright."
4,"Roomy, durable, and convenient","This is a nice, roomy and good quailty bag. The main pocket is just one big pocket, with no inside pockets. It is great for throwing stuff in, and I can fit a change of clothes and diaper/wipes for both kids. Plus snacks and drinks. My only complaint is that if I do want to bring water bottles or sippy cups, there are not pockets inside or out that will keep them from turning sideways. Still worth the buy though."
3,Unique,"I listen to a community college radio station that has no set format. KEPC [Colorado Springs]plays a mixture of music. One song I heard recently was from Lords of Acid. So I ordered the CD. Very unique music. Not Carpenters, Basa, or Enya. But not Def Leppard either."
4,A journey to understand life - interesting and sweet.,"I've read all Mary Gordon's fiction work. I picked this up after a few years on my get this when it's in paperback list. As someone who lost her father as a young child, I found it fascinating how Mary was able to find out so much about her father. And couldn't we all do better knowing our parents this well even in life?! It was a wonderful to find out about his life, even though she she didn't like all she found. Yes there are some slow, almost tedious sections when she writes about his writing. But how she comes to grips with all of the secrets and history and still has unconditional love for him makes me feel better about this world. What a lesson she has passed to her children, and her lucky readers."
3,Too much self-pity,"Author Mary Gordon's intimate biography of her father is told as an account of the author's own adventure in researching and recalling the embarrassing facts of her father's real life. Most of the drama comes in the author's feelings of betrayal, guilt, and disillusionment, so the book functions more as an autobiography, as is emphasized by a lengthy addition describing the author's mother's life.Gordon has an engaging, lucid style, and the first half of the book has some suspense as she pores over records and searches out witnesses for the truth about her father's unusual life. But ultimately the self-pity becomes wearying, and one wishes the author could gain some perspective and be grateful for her blessings."
3,Mainly for the serious baseball fan,"This is probably different than most baseball books you may have read. This isn't a wistful recollection of Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, and the Big Red Machine. In fact, the owners are more of a focus of this book than the players. You will learn how baseball, the economy, and social life throughout American history have often been intertwined. It's as much a history book as a baseball book.While the book covers all of baseball's time periods, the best parts cover the sport's beginnings in the mid-1800s through the 1930s. The author seemed to especially skimp on the chapters covering 1970 to today. Also, this book includes tons of numbers, and as such, might prove to be tedious reading for the casual fan. Perhaps some additional pictures or other graphics could have been included to break up the chapters a little better.I wouldn't call this my favorite sports book of all time, but it's certainly worth reading."
3,"Good summary of baseball history, but lacking","A quality, readable short history of baseball. However in only 200+ pages this book is superficial in its treatment of major events. I am not sure to whom Mr. Rossi was directing his book. It was too brief to be a book for serious fans, and probably best for the casual fan. Clearly it was well researched and well written. I find the best baseball books focus on an era and weave more of the current events into the book. Summer of 49, The Boys of Summer, and A Clever Base-Ballist(1880's) are examples of these type of books. Mr. Rossi set out to write a survey of many eras and I do not fault him for that lofty purpose. However it seems that he had an opportunity to write a more full treatment of each era covered."
3,"Heavy on Baseball, Light on History","It seems as though nothing has changed throughout baseball history. It always was and still is repleat with gambling and alcholism. There is no delay in getting to the details. Mr. Rossi jumps right in and never lets up with facts, figures and insights. It has ample doses of baseball statistics throughout history, but does not give ample attention to the days current events. There simply isn't room. I'm not a baseball fan, but I enjoyed reading this book."
1,Bait & Switch,"This company offers to sell the original replacement part HQ4PLUS, which is no longer in production and not available for retail sale. The company substitutes another part HQ56 claiming it is the same as HQ4PLUS. (which it is not).HQ56 is available at almost any retail outlet, is the current list replacement for HQ4PLUS by Norelco, but does not fit all old Norelco razors correctly. HQ56 fits the razor, but pulls on the beard when cutting, and gives a choppy cut.Why would this company list the HQ4PLUS knowing it plans to ship the customer another part number altogether? This is called bait and switch....and as a final insult, I sent the HQ56 back at my shipping expense and did not receive a credit or refund. If you feel like blowing $35, this is a perfect deal for you."
5,Happy customer,"It is so great to be able to buy parts for this (relatively) indestructible razor on amazon.com. Easy, fast, and reasonably priced- yay!"
5,Satisfied,"After using previous blade for five years, quite a difference. Sharp, fast, and smooth. Product arrived 48 hours after order. No complaints."
3,Out of Uk,"Ok, I didn't realize this was a publication for the UK. It is a great magazine but since I don't live in or visit the UK half of it is irrelevent. The recipes are to die for but they are metric, it is easy to convert them though.All in all it is nice to have a source of printed vegan materials arrive at my house."
1,"Not So Healthy, not so great",I bought this because of all the great reviews. It certainly does not live up to the hype. Only a few of the recipes even sound good...and I can't figure out what is healthy about them.
3,Good,"Pretty basic things, nothing crazy. No pictures except on cover. I haven't had an opprotunity to cook out of it yet but seems pretty decent."
1,"Contrary to the title, it's too much fuss","I own several ""quick and healthy"" cookbooks and this is how I do my meal planning. I only cook for two, but I've found that this cookbook just doesn't do it for me. I think that most of the recipes are *too* healthy for the average person - they just don't sound good. Additionally, I find that the ingredients are often expensive and sometimes unknown to me. The ""for two"" option isn't helpful for me either, as it often calls for uncommon ingredient portions anyway, so I'd be just as well off converting an existing recipe to serve fewer people.The book offers a handful of pleasing recipes and some good healthy cooking tips, but I don't think it's worth the purchase."
3,A cookbook without a single picture!,Nothing disappoints me more than a cookbook without a SINGLE picture/photo. While this book sounded great based on the reviews I was very unhappy when it arrived and quickly returned it. If you like your recipes to come with a picture - don't buy this book.
3,Good for quick recipes,"This is my go-to cookbook when I want a tasty meal on a weeknight. I hate eating leftovers, so it's great to have portions for one or two people. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent cookbook,"As my husband and I became empty-nesters (and older), we needed to change our cooking habits. We were looking for current, healthy foods that were truly filling and tasty. This book fits the bill!! I have recommended it to all my friends and continue to buy it as a gift. No recipe has let me down. For the most part, it works with those on weight watchers and people who just want to eat healthy and not be hungry."
4,"Great, Good Tasting, Easy to Make Recipes","We've been trying to watch the way we eat over the last few years. However, most eating healthy cookbooks have recipes for 4 to 6 people and we've tended to make the recipe according to the instructions. This book actually gives to teh recipes for only 2 people and it makes much easier to stick to a diet."
5,Exactly what it claims to be,"This is a wonderful guide to cooking, with beautiful illustrations, a great personality and helpful hints for the novice cook. I bought this book for my little sister who is on her own in college, and she absolutely loves it! Easy recipes + healthy food = excellent cook book."
2,"If you love to cook, don't get this book.","The recipes in this book are not very appetizing. (Gingered brussels sprouts?) If you like to cook with fresh ingredients, look elsewhere. There are a number of recipes that call for canned items. Of course, occasionally using canned beans is fine, but when it's so easy to roast beets...why bother with the canned?Simple recipes, average food...good for the first time cook."
2,Lots of hype - NOT HEALTHY for sure,"Cooking for two: Yes. The book offers recipes for 2 or 1 person. Great.Healthy: Not even close. Most recipes call for butter, all-purpose flours, eggs, sugar, etc... Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with those ingredients, I was just expecting a better emphasis on healthier alternatives and also actual recipes that maximize good balance.Recipes: Most sound not so appetizing.In summary, it seems that this book was written without any inspiration or any type of real base for health. Was probably an adaptation of various recipes find in other books, rewritten and calculated to accommodate for 2 people servings. Slap a ""Healthy"" in the title, call it low-fat (I can call anything low fat if serving is small enough) and add a little ""R.D."" after the author's name and I too can get a ""best seller"".Sorry for the negativity, but I needed to warn others that this book is far from healthy."
2,Unrealistic,"I ordered this book because, having graduated college and tired of Ramen, I needed to know how to cut, mix and heat real food. The produce and ingredient recommendations are not for the novice cooker. It's easier to eat fat food than to eat healthy, so unless you're serious about making a change in the way you shop, frequency in shopping, and flavors you're accustomed to, get your recipes from your mom and the internet."
1,Save Your Money!,"I bought this book because of the good reviews it received. Most of the recipes are simply things I would never cook...maybe because I'm a ""southern cook"". Things like ""Rigatoni alla Calabria"", ""Mussels Steamed in White Sauce"", and ""Asparagus in Orange Sauce"" are recipes I would never try. I LOVE cookbooks, trying new recipes, but this is a cookbook I will probably NEVER use. I was very disappointed. Phyllis"
1,Misprint,This book starts out with the cover recipe stating it is cornish game hens.It looks like crab cakes to me with some beans not salsa. The recipes are boring. I was going to give this as a gift Off to shop for some thing else.
1,"BBB - Boring, Basic & for Beginners","Considering that the title itself implies the simplicity of the recipes, I feel a little bad about complaining about the quality of this book, but hey, I will anyway.If you are a beginning cook and have never made tuna salad and/or have thought to add something other than mayonnaise to it, if you have never made a meatloaf (low fat?) or boiled a noodle, then this would be a good book for you, otherwise, the boringness of the majority of the recipes will make for a very dusty book on your shelf.The sample recipes featured on the Amazon ""Look Inside"" function seemed interesting but have turned out to be the rare exception that stand out from the dull, simplistic everyday recipes that any good cook could throw together without thinking.The crappiness and lack of inspiration in this book would make even Rachel Ray laugh out loud."
3,Just for you... not always two,"Be sure both of you agree that these recipes sound good before you buy. When we tried one of the recipes and were overwhelmed by the power of the wine. The ""for two"" portions need some side dishes in order to make a full meal.It is very well rounded in the types of recipes and new combinations that you'd never imagine. I recommend this to anyone with an open mind - not for picky eaters!"
4,Great tasty & basic healthy recipes,"I am a foodie, and I sympathize with the readers who thought this book was too basic. But it has been a great find, as I am a foodie married to a REALLY unadventurous eater. The recipes here are not fancy, but they are pretty consistently good comfort food. They're also healthy without relying on any bizarre diet-y substitutions. I have grown especially addicted to the Cincinnati Turkey Chili, which is now my go-to dish for casual pot-lucks. (It also freezes beautifully for brown-bag lunches.) The Deviled Chicken is easy and tasty. Best of all-- my husband will eat the recipes from this book."
2,Just OK Recipes,"The recipes in this book are ok - nothing fantastic. Most of them are easy and quick to make, but I haven't found any favorites that I want to have over and over again."
4,Worth the $,This book is great for someone who is just learning how to cook. Most dishes seem easy to prepare and are just the right portion since most cookbooks usually list ingredients for 4 servings.
3,Chinese china,"I wish I had been able to determine beforehand that these were made in China: they are very nice, but I would rather have bought something US made."
2,eh,Couple of good tunes but mostly hackneyed and sensationalist bordering on comic or novelty tunes. I don't think we needed an entire CD of this music. There are better collections to spend your time listening to. Disappointing.
1,Be Thankful.... Discofied??? No Thanks,"William DeVaughn's seminal work was Be thankful for What You Got (the main reason for buying this CD). It was a double platinum (2 million) best seller, in 1974, and deservedly so for its message of pride no matter who you are and what you have (or may not have). THIS version (x2) is some cheap disco remix of the original, carrying nothing of its soulful depth of feeling. Buy the CD with Mr DeVaughn's photo on the cover. It is available on Amazon for a fraction of the price of these imports. It has the original versions of his works, and you will then Be Thankful For What You Got."
5,GREAT,A well made figure great for people who collect Alien figures with high detail anyone who makes diaramas or stop-mothions will love this figure.
5,Great for someone who is always on the move,"There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said in previous reviews, but I want to just say how durable this money clip is. I take it with me when I go jogging and it is with me all day when I am on the job at construction sites. I am constantly on the move with it in my pocket. I've had it for months and it has not owrn out at all. I appreciate a product that is cheap and made well."
4,wish it was slightly bigger,i like the product but it is too small to hold the bills. I wish it was slightly bigger and had pouch to keep a few credit cards. i would not recommend this to anybody.
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED - POOR QUALITY,"Well - I purchased the same money clip in June for $8.99 from Gem. Worked great and the I lost it when paying a restaurant bill, I left in on the counter.I repurchased it from Gem in October (same item) and it just came in. It is horribly made unlike the first one. This one seems to have a thicker piece of metal for the magnet to attach to. This then makes the ""Slim"" design not so slim at all.As a matter of fact, it does not even close properly because of the thickness it shapes itself like this when closed "" > "" so it does catch on my pants pocket when taking it out.This order also cost $4.99 in shipping which Gem says they do not return & I have to send it back. The post office shows $1.95 for postage on this 3 oz. shipment . . . so Gem made money on that as well.So to return an $8.99 item it has already cost postage of $6.94"
3,Just about Average,"Had my hopes up that this would be a little higher quality, but I really should have know better given the price. You get what you pay for on this item. Its made in China, leather is very cheap and when open the inside it's black fabric not leather. The fabric is decent quality though and looks durable, it also has some texture to it so it might have a better grip on the money than if it were leather.Magnets are quite strong. I haven't tested it out on any bills yet but it looks like it should hold 10+ folded bills.If you are looking for an inexpensive solution, this will do the trick, however, if you are expecting something more high quality I would look elsewhere...this money clip is very average. I'll be searching for other solutions for my needs."
5,Magnetic Money Clip,My husband lost the clip that he had for 10 years. This one is a great and reasonably priced replacement.
5,Great Money Clip,"I am more than happy with this and the price can't be beat. The magnets are very strong, the clip is attractive and I like that it's on the large size (won't lose it like I did the last one). Highyly recommended."
4,Good music,"This is one of the best collections of Mariachi music from Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, El Mariachi de Mexico!!!!!!!!"
2,Boring!,"This book is so terrible, it has every bad point a Harlequin romance can ever have. I only gave it 2 stars for the description of Alejandro. HE, at least, was just an alpha male who knew what he wanted and went after it. It really should be titled, ""Abby's a Wimp"". Abby has let everyone walk all over her since day one. Her dithering and her lack of self-esteem is so totally annoying, I could hardly finish this book. Unless you want to read about an annoyingly weak woman, who gets manipulated throughout the story and never grows out of her weaknesses, don't bother with this one."
1,Don't believe the description,The description of this product clearly states twice that it's for LARGE roaches. Just received it and on the box it says for SMALL roaches. Don't need it.
5,Crying laughing so hard,"This is the best comedy CD I have ever listened to. I have had all my friends listen to it and they love it as well. This CD is filled with facts about the male and female bodies, emotions, thoughts,and more. It will have you crying you will be laughing so hard, I was and still do everytime I listen to it. I would say this is not for younger kids, but it isn't X-rated either.I am on the hunt for more of his CD's. Please buy this and listen to it, I guarantee you will love it and want to listen to it many times over!!!!"
3,Cold and unemotional,"Faure's chamber music is one of the finest moments of French music, yet this performance by Domus, while technically flawless, is rather cold and unemotional. While it's not bad per se, I don't think it does justice to Faure's music."
2,The book is amusing but not so beneficial,"reading the book is amusing and full of fun,but the beenfit is so little"
3,For Motivation,"If you are reading this review, you don't need this book. You already have what it offers-motivation. If you care enough about the SAT to read reviews of the best practice books, you will do well; trust me. This book is for students who need a push to prepare. While not a bad book for its purpose, it spends too much time motivating, and not enough time teaching. There are relatively few practice exercises, and the answers are too basic for motivated students. Instead, I recommend buying Cracking the New SAT 2005 from the Princeton Review. It has three complete tests, and the main text provides excellent strategies for attacking questions in math, verbal and writing. With time and practice, you will definitely do very well on the SAT."
2,BEWARE!!!!,"This is a cute book, easy and fun to read and study with, however....BEWARE! Page 308 gives you information that is wrong! It states that it is OK to make a bold line thru the oval and the test will be OK. It is not OK!!! My test score showed only 4 correct answers and now I have been waiting 9 wks for my test to be handscored. It cost an additional $50 to have your test handscored. I have notified Workman Publishing but I doubt any corrections will be made. MAKE SURE TO BUBBLE IN THE WHOLE BUBBLE! I wonder what other wrong information is in this book?"
5,Very good SAT book.,"Up Your Score is for anyone taking the SAT. Instead of providing with many practice questions, it teaches you tips and tricks of how to tackle each type of them. I recommend reading this book before you begin practicing with sample tests. It will help you a lot in strategies and answering."
2,"It's OK, I Guess","I got this book for my son. He read it, and so on, but when he tookthe SAT, he got fairly low grades (500s). Then we sent him to thePrinceton Review. Each of his three SAT scores was raised about100 points (600s). That's the difference between UC and Cal State.On the other hand, the Princeton Review is _expensive_. . ."
5,KC HiLiTES 127 SlimLite Black 100-Watt Fog Light System,"Nothing but good things to say about these.Super bright and work great.Well worth the buy/price.Easy to instal, took me a little ove an hour.Was also able to hook them up with pre-existing factory wires/switch.installing the switch that comes with It though is not difficult by any means. I had to do that when I installed my long range lights (same process)."
5,enjoying it,I ordered this audio book for my husband who just loves it. He replays it over and over even though he has the next set to listen to as well.
5,Essential Church,"I have yet to find a bad, average or boring Church album. Granted I only have 6 so far. I didn't think that anything could top Blurred Crusade or Remote Luxury. FY is as good if not better than both the formentioned.Next for me is Priest Aura... Dont wish me luck. You dont need it with The Church"
5,Forget every other new album out there,"I only have one other Church album...""Starfish"" which I got after I heard ""Under the milky way"" featured in the cult classic film ""Donnie Darko""....Than I heard about this album , I liked Starfish(it is quite better than average) but this cd is amazing....maybe longtime Church fans(unlike me) will not be able to agree that this is better than Starfish , but certainly admit that it is a masterpiece. It is beautiful, and I love it. Buy it if you like good music..... if you have shown any kind of interest in The Church before, than you probably do."
5,REALITY,"Questions:Why is this band playing only in small venues in the US?Why are they on independents?Why aren't their songs being whistled by people going to work?Answers:Under-the-table-paid media.Aging-yuppie accountants with no style.Members over forty (unfortunately, this happens)Final Note:It's not the bands fault. They are caught-up in the modern world's twisted fate. Buy this immediately and enjoy them!! They still have the energy of their old days, but are wiser and know where to place the notes with a gentleman's touch."
2,Bratz are DEFINETLY rated 12+!,"A'kay, i was on the Bratz site, right? I LOOKED AT something that said 'get to know Jessica Alba' and it was a short interveiew. can you evem GUESS WHAT THE FIRST Q UESTION WAS? Well, here it was:How do you feel about your tough, sexy girl image?AND IM DAM SERIOUS!!!!!!!!!! I LOOOOOOVE BARZ AND WOULD NEVA LIE ABOUT THEM.

2,A Bratz doll copy of a Bratz doll!!!,"Why do another band of ""Rock Angles"" when the already have ""Space Angels""!!!????? Besides!! I love the clothes on lots of Bratz BUT THESE!! EWW!! It's like Oscar monkey liking his toes on the Save-Um's! show!YUCK!** Panda*Princess*Stella*Dana*Topaz ******* Bratz no copy of Blyth! Me hate blyth! Pullip cuter! Blyth no copy of Pullip! *****"
1,Bratz are Brats,"I think that bratz dolls are UGLY! Do you know why?1) They have huge feet that come off. When they go shoe shopping, they're probably like ""Oh my gosh, Jade! Look at these feet! should I buy them?"" That's literally what they have to do, because they have no feet. They're shoes are their feet. Ewwww!2) They have huge lips. When they put on their make-up they probably have to use a whole stick of lipstick every time they put it on.3) They don't have a nose. They probably can't breathe through their nose so they probably have to open their mouth and breathe out of that. Who knows? maybe they were born with one, but they had plastic surgeries to get it off just like Michael Jackson.4) Their head is huge! They wouldn't even be able to walk because their head is too heavy. They would fall once they got right side up.Those are just SOME of the reasons I don't like bratz. I used to LOVE them, but not anymore because I got a reality check and noticed that Bratz are snotty."
5,YASMIN ROX,All i can sai is - WOW. This doll is sooo GORGEOUS! I WAZ VERY EXCITED about this doll! She has beautiful soft hair and gorgeous eyes! I luv her clothes. i think you have GOT to get her now..

5,Pretty Doll!,"I`m getting Bratz Rock Angelz for my 11th Birthday (Which is tomarrow!) I saw her at Target and she is PRETTY! I hate the silver navle ring, though she still is a pretty doll. The clothes are stylish. I`m also getting Demon Days CD by the Gorillaz.Peace Out,StarGirl (Who turns 11 tomarrow! ^ _ ^ )"
1,A VERY BAD DOLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS DOLL IS BAD. SHE HAS A TATOO AND A PEARCING IN HER STOMACH.THIS THING IS A BIIIIIIIIIIIG PROBLEM IF SOMEONE WILL HAVE PEARCING IN HIS BODY,AND BY THE WAY,IT`S TOO BAD THAT MGA MAKES BAD DOLLS FOR LITTLE GIRLS.THIS DOLL MAY TEATCH SMALL CHILDREN TO MAKE BAD THINGS ON THIER BODY WHEN THEY GROW UP.IF SOMEONE THINKS IT`S SO COOL TO HAVE PEARCING OR TATOO ON HIS OR HER BODY,IT`S HIS OR HER PROBLEM.THE MY SCENE GOES HOLLYWOOD DOLLS AND BARBIE AND THE MAGIC OF PEGASUS IS VERY GREAT FOR LITTLE GIRLS.MATTEL MAKES 100000000000000000000000%TIMES BETTER DOLLS FOR LITTLE GIRLS.GET MY SCENE DOLLS OR BARBIE DOLLS ARE WAY BETTER.THEY ARE PERFECT TO COLLECT.MY SCENE AND BARBIE RULES,BUT BRATZ DOLLS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I am caught in between,"I think yasmin is SOOO pretty the belly ring is ok cause i put one on my barbie once. BUT,WHY DID THEY PUT A TATTO ON HER?!DO PEOPLE THINK IT IS OK TO PUT BELLY RINGS AND TATTOOS AND OTHER STUFF ON THEMSELFS OR SOMETHING?!"
2,when she was good,"I had wanted to read a book by Philip Roth for a while, and I must say I was disappointed!The characters were real and interesting, but the plot was sloooooooooow, to the point of being boring!I do enjoy psychological books,but this was too vague for my liking...Mary Larsen and Sue Miller, here I come... you are the best of that genre!!"
4,"Slow to get my interest, but the ending made up for it.","When I started reading this, I almost gave up on it. It seemed a little slow and fairly dull. But once I got into the book, it started to get more interesting, perhaps I just missed the subtlety at the beginning. I absoultely loved the evolution of the main charater, and how she tried to maintain control, even as things were falling apart. The irony of it was so bitter, and the ending was tragic. When I closed the book I felt emotionally drained."
3,Effects Of An Alcoholic Father,The beginning of the book is very slow moving and at times confusing. It does progress into a more enjoyable read. The ending is an astounding and sad.Lucy seems only strong when confronting her parents. The effects of her alcoholic and abusive father can be seen in her younger life and her marriage. What he suggests she does to take care of one of her problems during college only shows how an alcoholic never has the means for the important things in life but always has the means for their booze.
2,Roth without Jews? Oy vay!,"I have read nearly all of Philip Roth's works over the last four months, and this very early work is the only book of his that I didn't like at all. There are NO JEWS in the whole book, and Newark is a thousand miles away! Phil, don't be a shmegeggy, come back to the neighborhood! In ""The Facts, a Novelist's Autobiography"", Roth reveals that Lucy is modeled after his psychotic first wife, who is much more interestingly rendered in ""My Life as a Man"". For the best of Roth, try ""American Pastoral"", ""Portnoy's Complaint"", any of the Zuckerman series, ""Operation Shylock"", or ""The Counterlife"". Just a humble opinion from a Roth Fanatic."
4,Blues for Sarka - NYJ Quartet,This is an old CD/ album but really great and laid back with nice flow and I enjoy it everytime I listen - so I bought it on CD as I have a Vinel version instorage somewhere.
4,very good Shah's record 'Tell It to Your Landlord',"I agree with ""deepbluereview"" in that this 'Tell it to your landlord' is a good record, and I think concretely that except the two limp and somemonotonous themes ""Baby, Scratch My Back"" and the somewhat nonsensical ""Bumpity Bump"" the record features authentic Detroit's Blues.According to PENGUIN GUIDE BLUES RECORDS in this BLUES record there's too much rock-guitar carpet bombing, Shah' s lyrics are often sketchy, shorts-winded first drafts, and the combination of peak material and undisciplined accompaniment makes the limitations of his playing and singing more apparent.Maybe PENGUIN's criticism is technically more accurate than mine,being only a blues lover. Also it is even possible that after your first listening you can relatively agree with some of Penguin's comments. But I believe that the criticism is overstated because after several listenings the record leaves a great flavour of genuine Blues. I give it 4 stars."
3,An OK Read!,"After thoroughly enjoying the author's previous novel ""Wish You Were Here"", I looked forward to ""This Perfect Kiss"". I was somewhat disappointed with Christie's latest effort. Although this book had its moments, they were too few. I felt the plot was weak and dragged on with a rushed ending. The main characters, who were adults and supported established careers, were too immature and naive for my taste and I felt the author missed some golden opportunities to write a few scenes around the webcam and Jilly's Victorian underwear. I thought this was an OK read and I would recommend it but felt it was not up to par for this talented author."
2,Disappointed,"Wish you were here was SUCH a great book, I quickly purchased another from this author. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I just didn't enjoy this one at all. I didn't really feel involved with the characters and I found myself just wanting to end the book so I could read something else. I really wanted to like it, but.... it just didn't happen."
1,"Needs updating badly, many web links old and not working","This book needs a serious updating. When I did find something that interested me, the chances were very good that the web links to their site were old and not working. Further searches for the company usually lead no where. Wouldn't recommend"
4,Good source tool,"This book is a handy source for just about every catagory of products you want to find to sell on or off the internet. Concise and resource filled, it is a valuable tool for sourcing a wide variety of goods. The only drawback is the unavoidable fact the many businesses come and go and some links are already dead in a book that is 2-3 years old. Overall it is a definite time and effort saver for finding most any type of product you can imagine selling. Highly recommended."
3,Great Supplemental Income Resource,"This is indeed a great resource with 202 Things You Can Buy and Resell. I think the Kindle ebook called ""How and Where to Find Wholesale Suppliers"" with OVER 100,000 Products contained a larger and better variety of merchandise http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006WTDOTM"
3,Good for the Money!,"This is a good general overview, it gave me alot of good ideas! It also, gives specific info regarding how to get started etc. I would definitely recommend!"
5,Great Indian Mystery**recommended**no singing & dancing,"It was a very interesting and absorbing mystery, with lots of twists and turns. The acting was excellent. We especially enjoyed watching the scenery of the area around Jaipur, and the settings seemed very genuine(ie. what the inside of their houses looked like). It was long at 2.5 hours, but even my husband wanted to watch the whole movie, and he's not a fan of the typical Bollywood-film.This was the first non-singing/dancing Indian movie I've ever seen, which makes it relatively unique, but I'm going to look into seeing if there are more movies like this out there!"
5,Excellent item and a must have for every carpenter/woodworker,"This item is great. I use it for checking the height of my table saw for dados, router bit heights, stop blocks, etc. If you are a trim carpenter or woodworker it should be in your toolbox. Perfect stocking stuffer or birthday gift."
4,For truck lovers,"I purchased this for my son. He loves playing with trucks so when I saw this, I had to buy it for him. Good educational game. He enjoys matching the different trucks."
3,Carlos shoe,"First off, it's a cute style. Kind of a dressed up espadrille. Online it is called 'off white', I'd say cream or very off white. I wear a 6.5 but this is definetly a half size smaller. I could not wear the 6.5. I did return it no problem, but did not order another size."
3,Jazz-Like Instrumentals OK But Not Great...,"The first Andy Summers CD I picked up was XYZ and I really like the dark beautiful sound of it, but I haven't found another one that compares. I'm not a fan of jazz and it seems that all his albums following are jazz instrumentals. I picked up World Gone Strange and Retrospective on the same day and so was a bit disappointed when I first listened to them. But, they are starting to grow on me. I like World Gone Strange, Charming Snakes, and Oudu Kanjaira as they are the least jazz-like. This album is nice when you want something quiet to listen to, but I prefer his XYZ vocals."
3,"Pleasant enough, but nothing to grab a person","Andy Summers played guitar with Police. Afterwards, he made three solo CDs for Private Music during 1989-1991. This retrospective features performances from each of the three.It sure isn't bad music. It does seem a little hard for Windham Hill, but then music doesn't need to be very hard to be hard for WH. Some of it is jazz, and the rest is pop instrumental.Police fans who dont have the previous three records probably will want this. But for most of us, this is very pedestrian fare."
3,First release,"Finally, after many years, ""STYX I"" has been released on CD. This version lacks the original cover, but at least it is finally on CD. This is far from their best, even far from the best of the Wooden Nickel releases. Best tracks are ""What Has Come Between Us"", ""Best Thing"", and ""Children of The Land"". This is a must have CD for a Styx lover, if not just to see the differences in the style of music. I believe ""Children Of The Land"" is also an ELP song. not for everyone, but for the Styx collector. Anyone else wanting to casually hear old Styx, stick with ""Best Of"""
5,Truly a must have for the true fan,"I've had this on LP for at least 20 years. Now finally getting it on CD. I can't wait so I can rip it and put it on my iPod. I started listening to Styx with the release of The Grand Illusion and when I found their older stuff (Styx, Styx II, Man of Miracles), I was even more blown away. I consider this more serious rock than their ""theme"" albums of the 80's."
3,"Their best, period","This IS their best album. Their first album. After that they got sucked into the downward spiral of pop-rock mediocrity. Never again to be as experimental or progressive. You might like this album even if you think you hate Styx, the stadium rock/power ballad Styx, anyway."
4,Seriously in love with this bag!,"I just got my McKlein laptop bag (in Aqua) and I couldn't be more thrilled. It is exactly as pictured, except more feminine and...so ladylike! The leather is high quality, (what some might consider stiff). It's like a fine gentleman's wallet. Everyone that sees it wants one, too. The bag can be easily removed by popping off the four clips. The extended handle doesn't feel really heavy duty, but I will report back on that after a few months of use. The only downside I see is that with my laptop, chargers, life scribe notebook and such inside, I was only able to fit one large file folder in the bag. So.... I've got a solution... Although I would prefer a smaller version,...Have decided to order the McKlein (non wheeled) bag in matching color and use it as a ""purse"" and extra files carrier. Wish, actually, that McKlein would recognize the market for high quality matching handbags!"
3,"nice looking, but not too roomy","this is very pretty and stylish, but for a case that's seemingly big and bulky, there's not a ton of space inside to cram a lot of things in and the front pocket is not very functional either. It's best for a fashion statement if you travel REALLY light and don't mind a little bit of bulk."
4,Nice classy rolling briefcase!,"I am very satisfied with my new briefcase. The outer pocket is large enough for my planner/notes. The large inner pocket fits my laptop in the included protective envelope and fits my power cord, Ethernet Cord, mouse, ipod, and earphones. I put file folders behind the laptop along the back. I can't say this is ROOMY, but it fit all the essentials. It rolls very easily and the back has a pocket so it can be piggy-backed on top of another rolling tote. The handle does stick from time to time going down but no trouble going up and very sturdy."
2,Beautiful bag... bad rolling assembly,"I purchased my McKlein Glen Ellyn rolling briefcase in October 2008. Within the first month, my rolling assembly handle began to stick... within another month, the handle became frozen in the down position. With some manhandling I was able to get it back up but would not fully close it again for fear of it getting stuck again. I sent an email to McKlein asking for assistance and never received a response. Now, after a year of handling this bag with kid gloves, the handle is fully broken. I've sent another email to McKlein asking for help but am less than hopeful about receiving a response. In short, the bag is beautiful and I get compliments all the time. But the bag has not functioned properly nearly from the start. After spending $200 on a bag, I expected better from McKlein."
2,"Won't hold 15"" laptop","This is a lovely bag, but the included laptop sleeve was too small for my wife's 15"" Thinkpad. In fact, it was too small for a 15"" Macbook pro or a 15"" Sony Vaio. Even without the sleeve, the Thinkpad barely fit in the bag, so we had to return it. Very disappointing. Item description should be changed."
4,ok gift for my wife,"Bought this for my wife. She wanted a laptop bag that was a more feminine than the usual. This is it. From a guys perspective, very well made - however, would have given it 5 stars if it were a little roomier...Update - wife has had this for a about 1.5 years. Have had to return it once. (customer service not too friendly).The snap on the front is not attached well. It will come off. My wife now just rolls without it.Also, The handle is a mess. Felt good to start - but just keeps deteriorating.About ready for a new one- and it will not be this brand."
5,"Excellent monitor that I have at my office, works great, great resolution.","I have had this monitor for about 5 months now, and have been 100% satisfied with it. It has a clear picture with a nice high resolution, and beats the heck out of the big box i had. It has the quality of being a samsung as well. Resolution with the video card in my computer goes to 1280 x 1024. Their is likely a newer version of this monitor available with potentially better resolution by now, but this is a tough one to beat. This model is 17 inches, their is likely a 19"" and 21"" model of this monitor as well, which with samsung you will keep great resolution even getting the larger monitor. Samsung also make a great 19"" widescreen that runs between $200 and $230 at most places, resolution is 1400 x 900 for the models I have seen. But, for a great NAME BRAND monitor at a decent price, this would be an affordable option. Compare, and I think you will see this is true"
5,This monitor is perfect,I have never had an LCD monitor before and I bought this one mostly because of the review and of course the price was fair. I am totally satisfied and would highly recommend it to anyone looking.
4,why 4 stars?,"The monitor, excellent in quality only contains a VGA port. No USB or any other connection types that you would expect from a monitor of this price. Again, the quality is excellent but the ""variety"" of inputs is poor."
2,Poor stand design trumps good picture quality,"I was excited to get this monitor, then was very disappointed when I set it up. The stand is very wobbly and any little vibration sets it rocking wildly. There is no way to tighten the stand when it's in the desired position. So, put something on the desk, write on the desk, breathe on the screen, sets it moving.Good screen quality, one stuck pixel (red). Haven't decided whether to return or use as an 'emergency' screen."
4,Plenty of reviews if you know where to look,"Nice video quality; no dead pixels; thinner bezel and equal PQ to my NEC Mutlisync LCD of the same size. Met or exceeded my expectations for a 17"" LCD.As far as very few reviews on the web of this model, you just have to know where to look. Another reputable etailer of primarily computer related items had 65 (favorable) reviews AND a lower price - received it quickly (two days). Look in your Easter basket for a ""new"" clue."
3,"Good service from Samsung, not Amazon...","The monitor worked great for three and a half months and we even bought a second for an additional PC. Several weeks ago a vertical pink line showed up and is there 90% of the time. I contacted Amazon and they would only give 30 days on any item for defects with no exceptions... I contacted Samsung and they are shipping a replacement today and even are paying the shipping on the old one. I guess I won't be buying any more electronics from Amazon, but will continue to buy Samsung products with that sort of customer support."
3,Cheap and cheerful but you get what you pay for...,"I bought this display just so I could test how the rest of the world sees the web as I am a developer, I also needed it for skype video as this feature hasn't been released for Mac users yet. If you have an older pc with an older video card then don't load in Samsung's colour management software - check to see if your card is supported first. I've had to uninstall all of it to get better results. The picture is bright and acceptable. The construction of the display is extremely cheap and any movement will unconnect the image so there's lots of wire jiggling involved. I'm spoilt by my apple cinema displays which are second to none in quality and construction... I certainly wasn't going to buy one for my junk pc."
2,Stops working,"I've used the 710N model for 2 years now. This monitor recently stopped working. My computer would be on and then the monitor would go black, the monitor would still be on but nothing shows up on the screen.I did a search on Google and found that this is a common problem across MANY of the Samsung LCD lines. The solution is to unplug the monitor for 5 minutes and plug it back in. This works, but now the monitor is doing this much more frequently.It's something with the circuitry. I suppose it was good for 2 years but now I have to buy a new monitor because I can't find the warranty papers.Buyer beware."
4,"Monitor, per se, very good","The monitor itself is fine; I would buy one again. Two small concerns, though.1. The outer box (Amazon's) arrived in bad condition; tape coming off, box partially open. I took photos, expecting to find nothing workable inside. However,the inner box (Samsung's) saved the day, with no damage whatsoever to the monitor.2. The monitor's stand doesn't tilt. This was something of a disappointment. We were able to put the monitor and stand on something that raises it about 4 inches, so everything's all right. But it's too bad Samsung didn't spend a few cents more on the plastic stand to make it tilt."
4,Real Value For The Money,"This was a Christmas gift for my son and we are both very happy with the clarity of the monitor, the quality of it's colors and the ease of setting it up.We both reviewed a number of alternatives prior to this purchase and we are convinced that we made the correct decision, this was real value for the money."
5,"Good product, good seller","I'm happy with the product, good price and good service. I needed this for a long time and I'm happy to have found this one, it's great.Thanks!"
1,Unreliable and inexcusable.,"I installed 45 of these monitors at a public library customer. Within a year of use, the first ones began failing to turn on with the power button blinking erratically. After two years of use, nearly two-thirds of the 45 monitors originally installed have failed with the power on problem. Never have I encountered such an unreliable IT product. Samsung's warranty repair process has been painless though and they offer a 3 month warranty extension to the standard 36 month warranty if the product is registered online."
1,Completely stopped working after 2 yrs!!,My monitor also went black after 2 years. We only used this for our computer so it wasn't getting constant use. When the screen went black it wouldn't even stay on long enough to look up a fix. This is very upsetting to me since I read the other post and this is apparently a common problem with Samsung monitors. The reason I am posting today is because our $1600 Samsung LCD TV just went black on us today. Luckily it came back on after unplugging it and then plugging it back in but I'm afraid this will be a problem just like the monitor. We really like this TV but it is only 1 year and 1 week old (which puts it OUT of warranty). Anyway I wondered if anyone else has had issues like this since they originally posted.
2,Nice fit + quality BUT expensive and stinks.,"I've had these for nearly 5 months. They look and perform well. I think they are overpriced for what they are. Worth $25 for the pair, not $45 plus. My biggest complaint is that they emit a chemical off-gassing smell. I am not sure why (cheap plastic) but they still give my car an off oder after nearly 5 months of use. It is particularly bad on sunny days when parked car heats up.Avoid unless you don't mind chemically oder."
3,Not impressed!,"I was quite unimpressed with the quality of these floor mats for the money. They work, with quite a bit of trimming, but I will not buy them again."
1,These are Universal Mats that need to be Cut to fit.,"These are NOT fitted mats for your BMW 3 Series. They need to be cut, trimmed, and fitted to match the contours of your vehicles floor. The product discription misleads one to belive these are custom fitted mats, not one word about cutting and trimming for fitment.If your considering buying these mats, do yourself a favor and go to your local Big Box auto store and buy a set of $20 dollar generic mats as these are not worth 3x the cost."
1,sure the pictures look good....but what about the recipes???,if you live in south india like i do (bangalore) you'll realize that this book is rubbish. sure the photographs are authentic (i guess the photographer made a trip to kerala) but i doubt the author has ever been to south india....the recipies in this book just don't add up to the mouth-watering pictures. if you want to buy a book on south indian cooking look for a cook who actually lives and eats in south india!!!
3,slightly dissapointed,"I Was disappointed with this book. There are several recipes that are not a staple of south India such as paneer, rogan josh, puris, koftas and birayani and chapatis--the list goes on--. I already have plenty of north Indian cookbooks so these recipes are not the kind that I was looking for. I suppose she used them as fillers. I was rather annoyed when I looked up the recipe for dosas. She substituted the rice in the recipe for wheat--not a common starch in south India--I would have been ok with this if she would have included the original recipe as well. She claims it's too ""tricky"" so she omits it. I have found nothing in this book that I did not find by doing an Internet search. As a matter of fact I did find the traditional dosa recipe that this book omits"
4,One of the best books on Kerala cooking,"I first read about it in LA Times Food section. Since we cook Indian food a lot, one of our favorite recipes is ""Konju Pappas"" - shrimp in a coconut milk broth from Kerala. When this book appeared, I bought it as a gift for my wife. She has cooked a number of recipes from this. All of them have turned out to be wonderful. Kerala is somewhat similar to Bengal in the orchestration of flavors in its recipes, so we find this book very useful. While the book does not have as many pictures as the standard cookbook, the recipes are very clearly laid out and easy to follow in a North American kitchen. I would recommend this book highly for people looking to explore the vegetarian cuisine of South India."
3,Where are the photos?,"I admit, I have not tried any of the recipes yet, but am initially disappointed by the huge lack of photos. Sure, there are some nice photos of India and food markets, but I really like to see a photo to accompany each recipe."
3,Great recipes but the spices are too timid,"I have been an Indian food lover for many years, and have cooked many recipes from a number of Indian cookbooks (Madhur Jaffrey, Julie Sahni, Yamuna Devi, etc). I am somewhat familiar with South Indian food, since there are now a number of great South Indian vegetarian restaurants in New York. Therefore, I was eager to try the recipes in this book. Having made several, I'd say the flavors are great but she has cut WAY down on the chilies to suit a Western palate. For example, her sambar recipe calls for a single chili where other books use as many as six!Having learned this, I'll increase the chilies from now on but I would have preferred the ""real thing"" from the beginning. Great book otherwise."
5,Great Indian Cookbook,"I recently hosted a dinner party with an Indian food theme. The friends that helped me with the dishes used this cookbook. Everything was fabulous, looked good and tasted even better. The dishes we made were every bit as good as any Indian restaurant I've ever been to which for me is the mark of a terrific cookbook. I highly recommend this book."
4,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rockstar, rockstar, rockstar. This game is simply unimaginable the landscape is HUGE way bigger than any of the other games, trailing through the hick countryside to vegas, to the ghetto to like a mountainy desert. More cars, bikes, planes, helicopters, bicycles, a tractor, a bulldozer, a huge dumptruck etc, etc and even a lawnmower!!!!!!! You can now eat, you can now swim, shop for clothes, dance at clubs, highjack trains, fly with a jetpack, have assets on property, descend with a parachute.... seriously people the list goes on and on into eternity. If you own any system you should by this game, it will not dissapoint you."
2,Timekiller,"If you want to get some stress out or if you're just bored, I recommend this game. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this second-rate game."
1,Attention!! to play this game in Xbox 360,This game will NOT work in Japanese/Asian version Xbox 360sbecause of the Region Code (NTSC)
1,Overcharged...,I was charged twice for this product. I received a letter in the mail saying the electronic transfer didn't go through and I sent a check to them with the statement they mailed me. After the check cleared they electronically withdrew the amount out of my checking account charging me twice.
5,Perfect Game,I Loved this game when i use to play it on my brother's xbox so i decided to get it for my 360.I do suggest that you have a Xbox hard drive before you buy the game(You need the hard drive to play original xbox on the 360).Other than that the game is PERFECT.
2,Freezes Consistently,"I love this game, but the copy I received freezes up after maybe 25 or 30 minutes of use, sometimes sooner, sometimes later. If you're not going mission-to-mission, it freezes a lot faster. Just not in a good shape, and I regret not sending it back."
4,Kenny's Got the Goods,"I was fortunate enough to experience 6 String Drag live several times before their unfortunate break-up. If you can find a copy of their last disc ""High Hat"", get it. Roby's first solo effort, Mercury's Blues, is a welcome consolation prize to the loss of 6 String Drag. The songwriting is just as solid with the same knack for lyrical storytelling that you'll soon be singing along to. Word has it there's more on the way. Keep up the good work Kenny."
4,Must see live,"I bought this disk at one of his shows. It is a marvolous disk but his live show had me laughing so hard I almost fell off my bar stool. If you live in or near North Carolina, go and see him in person."
3,dog enjoys it,"The dog really enjoys it, but I wish all the rope parts were the heavier type rope instead of some flimsy cloth tubing with filler."
5,Fun for tug of war,"Like I said in the subject line. It's a good toy for three way tug of war, but even a really good pull can tear it apart. It has a little bit of stuffing but it's lasted to my surprise!"
3,OK toy,My pup plays with it for a few seconds and then is on to some other mischief. Doesn't hold her attention.
1,Poor durability,"This product is composed of two types of ropes: soft, cotton-stuffed rope and regular rope. Our 20lbs jack russell was able to rip out the cotton-stuffed portion of the toy within seconds of playing. she started chewing on the cotton and the ripped-off rope. She could've easily choked herself had I not been watching carefully. I ended up un-doing the knot and removing the cotton-stuffed rope. Very poor construction, given the fact that our dog is not exactly a powerful chewer."
2,It's different,Camo likes this one. I can't really play with him with it though. The braids are a bit too short for both of us to hold on to it.
2,Instantly Falls Apart,"Dog liked this alright but it immediately started to come apart. It's just not a sturdy toy. Maybe I got a bad one, but I could tell this wasn't going to last long as soon as I opened it up. If you want a rope toy, find something else."
2,Too hard and too big for small breeds,"We have a 1 year old Chihuahua that loves to rip her toys apart... especially if it makes some kind of a sound.This toy is pretty boring, but it is very strong and she likes to play tug for a few minutes before she decides to bring another toy.The problem with this is mostly the combination of knots and the type of sturdy cloth that make it very hard (also slightly heavy) and could become dangerous (for the dog) if they decide to swing it aroundSo if you have a very small breed you should just get another squeaky toy. Just not that ""Ethical Plush Skinneeez Monkey"" crap that breaks after 5 minutes:Ethical Plush Skinneeez Monkey Ast 16-Inch Stuffingless Dog Toy"
2,Looks good but had to throw it away!,"This is such a cute toy. I was so excited to give it to our 9 month old lhasa. However, she was able to undo the knotts at the end of the cloth tie offs and the ones that are from a lot of strings tied together, she would pull on these until they were a mess and I kept cutting off all the loose strings. She would also choke on the strings if they broke off while chewing on it. Finally, it had three handles on it where she was pulling the center apart. Mind you, she only weighs 10 lbs. It's really not a good toy for a puppy, at least not mind. The idea looks good but they apparently didn't test this one!"
4,Works for my strong chewer,"My dog is a 55lb mutt who is a terror with chewing. To the point where I almost never buy her anything with even one review of someone saying their dog destroyed a toy, because it doesn't matter whether the product description says it's for strong chewers. But I took a chance on this one, because she loves rope and knots, and thought I'd give it to her for Christmas and just keep an eye on her while she chewed it.Turns out it's lasted quite well, for whatever reason. The rope is fine, of course, but even the cotton fabric ones she's only frayed just at the ends so far. It wouldn't take her long to get through them if she wanted to, so I do check it whenever I walk by, but I'm very happy with this toy."
5,This Rag Ball is a Ball,"We have a new addition to the family: a 6 month old German Wire Haired Pointer named Clubber. We have showered him with toys but this is his ""go to"" one. When I tell him to get the ball he always brings this one to me. We have so much fun with him with this Rag Rope Ball. Thanks for keeping him happy."
1,One Hour of Fun,I got this toy for my dog because it was supposed to be indestructible and fun to play with. My dog immediately fell in love with it and played fetch with it. Right after I gave it to her I put her in the car and drove to my parents house. She killed the toy before I even got to their house which is about an hour and a half drive. She managed to undo every one of the knots on the rope legs and they were all frayed. She also ripped into some of the fabric legs and ate the stuffing. This was an expensive toy for her to only be able to use it for an hour. She was only sitting in the car so it's not like she was running around wrestling with it. I am disappointed in this toy and wish that it would have lasted longer.
1,Lasted about 30 minutes,"The toy looks good, puppy liked it, but it didn't last long. The rope part is great, but the fabric has stuffing in it, and before long, the puppy has stuffing in her mouth. If you go for this toy, suggest good supervision."
2,My 17 lb puppy ripped through this toy in minutes!,"I was initially excited about this toy. Our dog loves all things rope and fabric, and I expected it to be fairly durable. He managed to rip the toy to pieces in a matter of minutes, and there was a lot of batting that he could have ingested if I hadn't been watching him closely."
2,"Fun, but not durable","My 14 week old lab/boxer puppy loves this thing. Unfortunately she's only had it for about 5 days and it's already starting to come apart. She's untied all of the rope knots, and chewed off some of the soft ends and got to the stuffing. I don't think it will last more than a couple more weeks. If your dog is a chewer, I would look for something more durable."
3,"Great, but doesn't last","My dogs love this toy, however, it only lasts for two weeks. It's going to be an expensive habit to continually replace."
2,Disappointed,Within 5 minutes the strings started coming apart from the ball. We were watching the dog play with it and he was not being abusive to it. We had to take it away after 5 minutes. This was a cute toy and looked good in the ad but is smaller than it appears to be.It would only be good for a very small dog who would be very gentle.
2,Poor Quality,"This was a toy purchased for my Boston Terrier puppy. He enjoys chewing on toys, however, doesn't typically chew through a toy or rip it to shreds. Not good quality. The rope pieces kept coming undone and weren't tied together very well. After a day of chewing it was ripped to shreds. The coloring on the rope ball is fading after one day and looks as if we've had it forever. I wouldn't purchase this toy again and wish I wouldn't have spent the money on it in the first place."
2,not as good as I thought..,Smaller than I expected. My 60lbs Spanador ripped the soft toy part in one bite. The rope part is o.k.
4,Brillante 5CDs Set,"Soon 5CDs set will be released from Brillante. If you want to collect this series, I recommend you the Brillante set. It costs much cheaper."
4,"Melodic, Satisfying Music","Most of us do not think of Dvorak as a composer of piano music. Aside from his ""Humoresque,"" we may be hard-pressed to think of any of his piano works. Out of the blue, then, came this CD, which turns out to be the first of a five-volume set. Recorded in Kiev, this turns out to be a fine and most enjoyable recording. The CD opens with Theme and Variations, Op. 36, interesting in their variety (9 movements in 15 minutes), followed by the brief, galloping Polka in E Major, then the miniature Silhouettes, Op. 8 (12 movements in just under 17 minutes), two stately Menuets, Op. 28, and finally the folky, rhythmic Dumka, Op. 28. Although only a few Dvorak fanatics might be tempted to pick up all five volumes of this set, I can certainly recommend Volume I as an enjoyable recording of melodic, musically satisfying piano works from a composer whom we do not usually think of as particularly pianistic."
4,Historical Movie,Movies are nice. These movies are specially made for children. From these animated movie children get more information about hereos of Maharashtra in easy way.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE,"Wonder Costumes sent me the wrong shoes!! The ones I received looked nothing like the ones pictured and when I tried to contact them to rectify the situation I first had to call 7 or 8 times before I actually got a live person (you can't leave a message) who then told me she would look into it and call me back within an hour, I never heard back from them! After trying for 2 more weeks to get a hold of them I finally gave up, now I'm stuck with a pair of shoes I never would have ordered!"
5,Moody Neuhaus - Excellent,"This is apex of the genre material. Kings of the dubby resonator with a light moody touch. Easily usable in house, microhouse, tech house, and techno sets... Simple elegance."
2,"If you want to dance, this cd is NOT for you...","I found this album to be very boring and repetitive. It sounded like something that even kids can make using the MTV sound mixer program - nothing unique, pretty much the same backbeat in every song, and not nearly enough instruments to even make it interesting. If you want something mellow and unexciting to play in the background while you're playing Halo2, buy this cd. But if you want to dance or even just groove to some smooth beats... stay away! I tend to listen to Juno Reactor, Prodigy, etc... and this album bored me to tears."
5,Best word game ever,Syzygy is very simple yet challenging for anyone who knows the alphabet and everyone in the game is constantly playing so no lag time waiting for an opponent to think of words. The game keeps moving and is a lot of fun.
3,"Fun, but easy to make yourself","The fun of this Scrabble-like game lies mostly in the speed challenge, racing other players to assemble words first. However, the ""official"" rules are very loose, basically encouraging players to use whatever rules they find comfortable. The tiles are a good size and seem durable, but the case isn't very practical, nor is it a good size for storing - there's a lot more box than there are contents.While I love the idea of this game, I think it would be easy to pick up a couple old Scrabble games at garage sales and combine the tiles. I bought this as a gift, and I'm very glad I did, because I've enjoyed playing it, but I would not recommend paying $30 for it."
2,Easybroken,"I've had two of these and both broke where the leg meets the torso. I dropped the first one from a hight of 2 feet onto carpeting and the right leg broke off. The other one had the left leg break as I was taking it out of the package (I'm always careful when removing action figures). The figure looks good, but they need to be more durable."
4,good,"nice product, just what i expected. the only difference is that expected the rim to be a bit wider. but the hat looks great, feels good on the head, and is very comfortable to wear compared to my previous one"
5,Nice CD from the 80's.,"I remember listening to the track ""Finders Keepers"" back in the summer of 1984 it stayed on the top charts for months and I never knew who the artist was, Leon Bryant like all the other R&B; artist of that time knew how to make music and make it last and had the beats to back it up with, this is one rare jewell that should be cherised for decades to come..., Mr. Bryantwhere ever you are please come back and make more music because unlike today's artist you gives old schoolers the true definiton of finders keepers."
5,Celly returns with a third bumpin album.,"Since the release of ""Heat 4 Yo Azz"", I have been a huge fan. On this album he comes with smooth, bass filled, Bay Area tracks. With tracks featuring E-40, Silkk The Shocker, UGK, Rappin 4Tay, Mack 10, and B-Legit, this album is a definite must have for all fans. One of the best Celly tracks, ""Its Goin Down"", has a new remix version with Rappin 4Tay and Mack 10. I suggest you go pick this one up."
2,"Good Byrne Art, Disappointing Story","As always John Byrne does an outstanding job with the pencils for this graphic novel. The story on the other hand was very disappointing. I don't know if it was just too ""British"" for me but I just didn't find it entertaining. The approach that was taken with Superman as a British citizen was not very flattering to the British people as a whole and the type of hero the British Superman became was insulting to the American version. I realize this is an ""Else Worlds"" tale and does not ""count"" from a continuity perspective but I did expect a more Superman-like story. Unless you really enjoy British perspectives on American heroes, I wouldn't waste your money on this one. There are plenty of other works by John Byrne to buy."
5,NEED TO DO SOMETHING ON FRIDAY NIGHT..,"Kevin Zegers plays Paul Dynan a struggling young man who can't make ends meet due to hard times and an ailing mother. But he has a plan...kidnap 3 spoiled rich kids with no likeable qualities and ransom them for money. He found two people who are a little psychotic to help him. They turn out to be wild cards in Paul's grand scheme.There is some first person narration by Paul in the beginning to describe his situation, but it ceases as the movie progresses. The movie touches on themes of anarchy and class warfare. Decent acting, well written.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
2,Disappointed,I thought by watching the trailer it was pretty good. The ending made no sense to me. Not to spoil it for anyone who might be thinking about renting this movie but how could someone actually use the millions of dollars they got from the crime and help his dying mother pay her doctor bills without being noticed? Plus the abductor shows up at the house at the end making it even more stupid. The reason I'm giving it two stars is that the movie was an eye opener as to be aware of your surroundings.
2,what about the stories?,"I found the writing style of this book dry and didactic. This book assumes a far too scholarly approach for the information presented. I expected to read a bunch of great stories about rabbits, and instead only found a few anecdotes about the author's personal experiences with her rabbits. If you want to read about rabbit behavior, this is not the book for you."
2,I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK,"I had high expectations for this book having lived with bunnies in our home for 17 years. The only people interested in this book would bepeople who already had rabbits and knew all about them. But the bookwas written for the novice - for someone who knew nothing. Anyway,the cover was lovely but the book itself - well, I skimmed it and putit away. Everything the authors said could have been said on pretty much a couple pages."
1,Anthropomorphism does lagomorphs no favors,"Unfortunately, the authors attempted to use their very limited experience with rabbits to write a definitive text on multiple areas of rabbit keeping.They exhort their theory on dietary needs, presenting it as fact when there actually are no studies available to support their views.They mis-quoted anecdotes that were written on an internet list, about raising meat rabbits.They had typos when describing a processing plant which created misleading impressions.With little understanding of group dynamics of rabbits, they force herd behaviors on them and insist that this is what rabbits prefer. In that area, they seem to think that rabbits are small furry people.The book may have amusement value, but as a guide to keeping rabbits or as a look at rabbits as other than house pets, it's useless. As a guide to keeping rabbits as house pets, it's inhumane."
1,Bashes Breeders,"This book has good intentions, to reveal the truth about rabbits. But in the breeders section, this book goes horribly wrong. Breeders love their rabbits, maybe more that pet rabbit owners. They spend time, money and love on their rabbits. Not all breeders make money off of rabbits, and that is the choice they make.If this book had not been some anti-breeder, radical animal rights book it would have done much better in my opinion."
4,Not so sure this is a book for the average rabbit lover...,"I bought this book to learn more about rabbits but was very disappointed when i couldn't stomach to read 2/3's of the book. I absolutely love rabbits and i know rabbits are treated very poorly in the science, fur and meat industry. I don't need to read how they're torn apart and harvested in gruesome detail. Not something i want to picture nor need to in order to get the picture of the injustice rabbits face. Unfortunately the people that really should read this book never will and the the people that love rabbits and cohabitant with them cant bear to read it... I did learn some new thing about rabbits, and would still recommend the book. Just beware its graphic! I do commend the authors for tackling the topic."
4,Simple Review of a Detailed Book on a Complicated Topic,"I quite enjoyed the first two sections of the book, which were filled with much historical and societal information on rabbits. The last section detailed too much of the disturbing facts about those rabbits who live only for experimental testing, meat, or breeding. However, just because I found it too upsetting to do more than skim does not mean it should be left out. Perhaps with open knowledge of these industries, people can do more to change how the businesses are run."
3,Starts nice but...,"Starts nice but... at the end it slows down, no good real practical info, lots of histories."
1,Contents,There is a tendancy for books to be placed on the market without any detail as to their contents. Nowhere have I been able to determine what songs are included in the instructional book / DVD and without this information why would one even consider buying it.
1,deceptive title,"There are no allman brothers performances on this dvd. Someone named Dave Celentano ""explains"" some guitar music. This DVD sucks! I would rate this ""zero"" stars if I could."
5,Now let me see.........,"I enjoyed the disc. Most of the pieces aren't serious, brooding deep compositions, however they are pleasant and very well recorded - a hallmark of HYPERION engineeers. Look elsewhere in his catalog for more indepth compositions."
5,awesome,"This is simply a great, great album. Beats and lyrics are original and just awesome. Each song can stand on its own, but its the way they're tied together that makes this album a listening experience that is second to none.I don't get why this group is relatively unknown - again, this is second to none. It probably helps if you speak some spanish to appreciate the lyrics, but even if you don't you'll enjoy this.If you like spanish rap at all - think Kinto Sol, Akwid, etc, you'll love this. Try this album."
5,Please note the size...,I love these and they are the perfect size for what I need. Creating small treats to put in Christmas goodie bags for teachers and co-workers. I just want to make sure you make note of the size before ordering. Mini means Mini... They are 1 1/2 inches long each and narrow but they make perfect bite sized cookies.
2,Too small for cookies,"According to my friend, these arrived in a box about the size of a pack of playing cards. Apparently I didn't read the description right, but these are more suitable for candy or fudge. Pay attention to the word ""mini"" when considering this product."
3,Might as well be a statue,"This isn't really much of a toy so much as a slightly poseable statue. If you prefer dusting your action figures rather than posing them or even playing with them then this is for you. I wasn't only dissapointed but so was my cousin..(the actual Kid I bought it for.) So now it sits on top of my computer desk looking slightly menacing.(edit and rebuttal)Dense? Hardly, when an Item is listed AS A TOY and claims to be fully poseable then I figure it must be a fully poseable toy.Secondly, there's no dripping blood or body parts.Thirdly, I already own the original Leatherface from MacFarlane toys, as well as pretty much all the other movie killers. (Including the Jaws playset.) And guess what the first thing my little cousin runs straight to whenever he is brought over? So I figured I'd get him one of his own.In my opinion, the newer figures aren't the same quality as the older ones. If you're a kid who wants to play with them, they're not as fun anyway."
3,Cookie's Fortune,"I hadn't heard of Ruby Wilson before seeing this movie, but I loved her big bluesy voice instantly after her opening number. I bought this CD hoping to hear more of her. Sadly, only one song (I'm Comin' Home, track 11) showcased her. I'm glad to at least have that one song. I am a fan of Dave Stewart's other soundtrack effort ""Lily Was Here"" and I was hoping I'd enjoy ""Cookie"" equally. But I didn't care for the sampling of movie dialogue that contaminates ""Cookie"". If you're hoping for a blues soundtrack that you can play from beginning to end, the snippets of dialogue will annoy you. In that case, I'd recommend ""Lily Was Here""."
4,Not what you may expect -- but surprisingly good!,"This soundtrack is probably not what you're expecting. I was expecting the blues music you hear throughout the film. This cd is that music with dialogue snippets rhythmically interwoven as the ""lyrics"". At first, this bothered me, and I was disappointed in the album, but after a few listens, this is really an enjoyable cd. The rhythms found in the spoken words are really a treat and a nice way to emphasize the soul of language. Not what I was expecting, but I'm happy all the same!"
3,"Yep, frustrating","The earlier reviewer hit it right. It has too much of a hip-hop element to it. (Anyone think the movie had any remote link to hip-hop? Hardly.) The dialogue loops send you for the ""next"" button on what would have been good tracks.There is still good music here, though, make no mistake."
4,good news and bad news...,this is a great die cast awsome detail 1 little thing the tracks keep falling off im reterning this product becaus i thout is was remote controll but its only a die cast witch meanns modly not rc so if your looking for a good die cast then this is for you...
5,(GREAT) ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!,"The only reason I get up in the morning is because of this album, thank you. So get this album, its better than coffee, it has very Beatleish type songs, nuff said."
5,A fun read if you have ever spent any time in the Keys,"What I enjoyed most about this book was it's very real depiction of the people and life in the upper keys. The places are real and his descriptions are right on. If you have ever cruised down US1 and enjoyed the laid back keys lifestyle, you'll enjoy reading this book."
5,A unique masterpiece.,James Hall has long been a poetic author. Under Cover of Daylight brings his poetic rhetoric to the surface. I highly recommend reading this book
5,INTRODUCING THORN,"I am really just getting into James W. Hall and living in Florida, shame on me. UNDER THE COVER OF DAYLIGHT is the first of Hall's Thorn books. Thorn is his Key's antihero. This book is so well done and has it all, location, colorful characters and a fast moving story line. I will certainly get the next book soon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,A good read at times but anti-climactic........,"I just finished this book, and while i found the author to be wonderfully descriptive at times, and the story to move along well, i thought the end was absolutely dissapointing. A great story line, which definitely dragged in certain parts, but of the 10 or 12 books i have read so far this year, this had the most dissapointing and ridiculous ending of all."
3,An average collection that does not justify its claims,"Self-proclaimed as a 'management classic', this collection rarely rises above the ordinary. Apart from a few brilliant articles such as ""Marketing Myopia"" (Theodore Levitt) and the satirical ""Parkinson's Law"" (Northcote Parkinson), the rest really do not fulfil the editor's claims as 'milestones'. Oddly, we have single chapters from classic books, like a chapter from Alfred Sloan's ""My years with General Motors"", which does justice neither to the original nor to its inclusion here. And what is de Bono's dubious ""Lateral Thinking"" doing in this book? Another reason why the book fails is that most articles are very UK-oriented -- several talk about Britain's Coal Board, Britain's incompetent managers, etc -- which makes a purchase of this book unnecessary for all but the most assiduous John Bull, MBA student."
5,Sexy!,"As I put one on it felt as if it was the wrong foot, I then grab a stocking and it just glide right in, this are a sexy pair of boots, the color is very fall looking!! LOVE'EM!!"
3,watch the lid,"It's a great pot--except the lid is not designed to stay on while pouring. It lies flat on the top of the pot and slides off when the pot is tilted to any significant angle. Also, the red coloring is a bit more garish and less tasteful in person than in the picture somehow. If I hadn't gotten it on a super bargain, I might have sent it back."
3,Loud,The shade is a bit loud for me and it was small - but as it is for a single female (=gift) - it should work. Seems nice and sturdy.
1,Dissapointed,"The teapot does not resemble the picture at all. It has no design, as depicted it should. I have had a horrible time with the seller trying to get this resolved. I notified them the same day that the shipment arrive that it was the wrong item, they promised to correct the issue and NOTHING has been done. Never heard another word. It's quite an ugly teapot that arrives when ordering this one. Unfortunately for me, this was supposed to be a Christmas present for my daughter who collects Asian inspired teapots. This one will definitely NOT be under the tree!"
2,Very nice...,"This pot holds exactly 17oz with the basket in. There seems to be a lot of confliction on this issue, and they may all have some variables, but mine's a 17oz pot. The enamel on the inside isn't perfect looking, but for the price who can complain? It doesn't dribble even topped off above it's 17oz capacity (with the basket removed and to the rim almost). The enameling inside of the spout seems pretty much perfect though, and this is the only area I can't hit with a towel after use so I'm glad to see that.UPDATE: I took the pot back. The enamel started flaking off really bad. I had read other reviews about this and assumed that they didn't know how to properly use a teapot (maybe they were using it as a kettle too? idk).... but using it exclusively as a pot, no washings (only a quick rinse with water).... the enamel flaked off really bad into my tea. I wish that this product came without enamel so I could just use it like a normal tetsubin, but that's not the case."
4,LITTLE TEAPOT,I recently purchased a cast iron teapot. The picture was deceiving and the description didnt say how many cups it held. Its really cute but only holds 2 cups. I can live with that. Down side is lid just sets on so falls off when pouring and is very hot. It also has a basket for tea leaves inside which I like as I harvest and dry herbs and often use a teaball.
5,naruto vol 5,"Naruto vol 5 was not my favorite, but it still was worth the price, and was still very entertaining."
3,Not as good as 1-4,I am a big Naruto fan and enjoy watching the DVD's so I have all 5 sets that have now been released. This set has some great episodes (most notably the three episode fight between Naruto and Neji) but for the most part is relatively plain. It has its' ups and downs but the ups are worth the price of admission. If you don't care about complete sets or things like that you can get the better episodes individually. I recommend the training with Jiraiya and the fight between Naruto and Neji. Otherwise wait till February and get the next set which should take you through the fight with Gaara. Good times.
4,"Great, action filled, dead on characterization","This is a fantastic collection of JLA stories. At first, I didn't want the JLA to expand to 14, but Morrison made me like the new guys, especially Steel. He continues to create fantastic threats, such as Prometheus and the Star Conquerers. Mark Waid did an excellent job, so much that you can't tell the transition between his and Morrison's stories. The stroy where all of reality is threatened is my favorite. THe only disappointment I had was Barda and Orion joining the team and Howard Porter didn't do the artwork for all the stories, but it is still a fantastic read."
5,Old travel book...,"A recital of incidents by a business man who has traveled for both business and pleasure in unfrequented parts of the world.Map of the South Sea Island Cruise. Black and white pictures of Marquesas Islands, natives of Tahiti Islands, a fire-walking ceremony, residence of Charles Nordhoff near Papeete, Tahiti. The end of the lava flow in the village of Futu after the eruption in 1929, home of Robert Louis Stevenson in Apia, Samoa."
2,Don't waste your money,"This is one of those unauthorized documentaries that does not feature any interviews with the band, and it does not feature their music, or any live performances. It is just people who know Slipknot, talking about them. This would be interesting if it were on cable, but do not buy the DVD."
5,imajin this,this cd wuz da bomb. it included everything a cd should have. it had songs with tight beats like in keep it to yourself. then there were the love songs like missing you and love letter. finally there wuz the straight up party songs like no doubt. in my opinion this cd is the best cd out there. you should go pick up this album.
1,Imajin-Not what I expected!,"I am very sorry that I bought this album,after the long wait,It was not what I expected,the album is very kiddish,and It is not great at all,none of the music is mature,also it sound's like it's for 11 year old's,I'm sorry,but,If anyone want's to buy this album,PLEASE save your money,It's just a BIG waste!Sincerely Hi-C."
5,THIS CD IS OFF THA CHAIN,"SOME PEEPS BY HATIN ON IMAJIN BUT THEY ARE THA BOMB.BEAUTY AND THE BRAINS TO MAKE A REAL HOT CD.I LIKE SONGS LIKE ""EVER AGAIN"",""LOVE LETTER""AND ""FLAVA"".I THINK THAT FLAVA DESCIBES THE GROUP.IF I COULD I GIVE A PERFECT 10"
5,I LOVED IT !,"These guys just don't have a pretty faces and cute bodies, they have a great record to top it off with. Some of my favorite singles are ""Flava,"" ""No Doubt,"" and ""Your the Bomb."""
2,Not much to this novel,"This is an elaborate short story in a novel format. The plot is simple but disguised with unnecessary ornamentation, and it fails to convince or captivate."
5,Palace of Tears,"In Palace of Tears, Alev Croutier wraps us up in her own magical reverie on a late 1800s-Frenchman who falls in love with a Turkish woman he sees in a miniature painting and sets out on a voyage to find her. Croutier's masterful handling of language and its layers only adds to the dreamy, ethereal nature of this novel which lulls you quite into another world, another age, making you believe you are drifting on a cloud above its protagonists. Taking her inspiration from Persian fairytales, Croutier leaves empty spaces for the reader to fill, ending up with a book that is interactive enough to fit in with our new high-tech age, while also harkening back to another, where poetry and love are always enough."
2,I felt like I was reading a children's fable...,"The sing song-y prose was reminiscent of the Little Prince and I sensed that she wanted it to read that way. It just wasn't endearing enough to engage my interest and the only reason I finished it was because it was really short. As mentioned in another review - the main character was rude and inconsiderate to his family and friends and only tried to be nice to the heroine. There wasn't any reason for me to root for him. The character development was thin and the plot was only mildly interesting. I read a lot of historical fiction and think that books like Shadow on the Wind and In the Company of the Courtesan are examples of how to engage a reader in wonderfully flawed characters and their stories.I have wanted to buy Crouier's novel Seven Houses, but am afraid that it will be like the Palace of Tears..."
4,Honesty and Courage,"With all the philosophizing and conjecture about the Kundalini force, we have here an account of a profound psychic experience by someone who has personally lived through it. Gopi Krishna, an obscure civil servant, tells his tale with great honesty and alacrity. I especially appreciated the lack of religious reference. The vital force is beyond religion. The author's integrity and intelligence add to the immediacy of his, at times, harrowing life story. But he tends to repeat and explain himself at great length, and the elegant writing style became overbearing after a while. The book could have been edited down by half without losing much. Still, an important and worthwhile read for those interested in the mysterious Kundalini force."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD IF...,"...you are like me and wanted the ""I Like What I Like"" cut. When I wrote my pervious review you could preview the tracks. The track that I previewed on the site was the original track from the original album.The CD I received DID NOT have the original ""I like what I like"" track even though that's what the web site had in the preview. It had a very lame and shortened version without all the orchestration from the original album track.The impression that you get is that the group found themselves running out of money and decided to rerecord this piece of garbage.It's interesting that Amazon no longer allows you to preview the tracks on the CD. False advertising?It's too bad there's no choice for zero stars."
4,Solid funk album.,"This is a little known band from Canada in the early '70s. They were on the same label with Kool and the Gang, and in fact they cover 'Who's Gonna Take The Weight' on this album. Otherwise this CD is pretty much in the vein of the Kool and the Gang recordings of the same era (Live at the Sex Machine, Live at PJs), with a somewhat shabbier musicianship. Don't let this scare you away though, they still rock hard, with some great grooves and some b3 lurking in the background on nearly every song.Highlights: 'Funky Granny', 'Funky Gene-ra-tion' and the instrumental 'Mama Said-Papa Said (Too Young To Marry)'."
4,"Good fit, but not great","These are custom fit, meaning trim to fit. However, they don't cover as much square footage in the areas that aren't supposed to be cut as I wanted. They work well, though, and are good quality."
3,Power Supply Buzzes like a bugger!,"I bought this from Abes of Maine and it arrived in great condition. Eveything works great. Picture is great. Card reader and Mp3 player through USB port all work well. The big problem is this - The TV makes tons of horible buzzing noises. Thsi is due to a problem with th epower supply. It's a switcher and makes tons of noise. If you use this in a small room, it will drive you insane. It's a known problem and anyone who buys this TV should make sure they have the latest Power supply installed in the unit. I am in process right now to have mine replaced under warranty. Samsung knows this is a problem and they should fix it without hassle. Other than that, it's a great TV for the money. I paid 1750.00 for it in April. Prices continue to drop and quality gets better each day. Wait until you need the tv to buy it. the longer you wait, the more you get for your money."
2,Dissapointing!,"I have listened this recital, because of praises which written in this page. Very dissapointing. Actually Hamelin will stand among secondary rank in great pianists ad infinitum. He always shows that he ""can play"" this instrument. But nothing exciting or meditative or lyric...Just pure, superficial technic. My only favorite Hameline is the third part of the second concerto of Shostakovich. That was not bad. I think he is good as concert performer for one enjoyable night. But I can't believe that he can play Bach or late Beethoven or Brahms, adequately. He can only plays his eccentricities. Ofcourse one should also praise him for his ""Alkan or Busoni effort""You may want to hear just for Alkan's interesting transcription."
2,"Well intended, but uninspired","I wanted to like this CD, but after listening to it several times I have to conclude that both the arrangements and the singing are not especially inspired. There is nothing NEW one gets from hearing these interpretations of the songs, and if you have heard them sung by others with a better feel for the words and music (e.g. Liz Callaway's or Patti LuPone's ""Meadowlark"", Lena Horne's ""Bewitched"", Streisand's ""I Have A Love"" and ""Some Enchanted Evening""), then the set seems particularly uninventive and emotionally uninvolving. It's vaguely pleasant, but I don't find myself wanting to listen to it again."
5,Working Dogs,A heartfelt look at many of man's best friends and their life's work. Pictures are all black and white and give insight into these pooches lives. Stories are vivid and entertaining. Great for the coffee table or a gift for the dog lover in your family.
5,Summertime Soundtrack,"Ahhh...the weather is finally starting to warm up...the sun is shining...the birds are chirping...i can almost smell the salt from the breeze from the ocean...And no better way to accompany the turning of the season than with Jehro. Summertime is right around the corner and Jehro is bringing the sunshine. This cd embodies the spirit of summer - from long lazy days on the beach to dancing outside in the cool summer nights. Grab a beer, a glass of wine, or whatever your drink of choice is...and relax to the sounds of Jehro."
5,"Who Knew ""World Music"" Could be This Good!","I was wandering around Borders and saw this CD. I listened to the first song and said, ""Well, that sounds interesting."" Little did I know, this would become one of the most addictive CDs I have found this year!I rarely listen to ""world music"" because I find most of it to be boring or something I can't relate to. Jehro is from France, but they sound more Caribbean/Latin then anything else! They don't sing in French - they actually sing a few songs in Spanish and they sound gorgeously romantic!Each song is fun, melodic, moving, simple-yet-beautiful. I particularly like the first 3 songs on the album (they have melodies that get stuck in my head), but there is NOT a bad song on this album.Expand your horizons, get some music you can sing to that sounds like Stevie Wonder met Sade met Pancho Sanchez...GET JEHRO!!!"
5,MOST STYLISH AND COMFORTABLE SHOES,"I have been re-ordering and re-ordering this shoe over the past 12 or so years. Besides being comfortabkle from day # 1, it is one of the only shoes still available with a heel. I have flat feet and need a heel. The styling is great and the price is also. I re-order them every 6 months. I actually get comments from people how attractive they look. I never get tired of them and am really suprised from the two prior comments that the sole came off. Can't understand that one."
2,Disappointed in quality,"Within 2 days of wearing these shoes, the sole started to fall off. A little shoe goo and all was better and the shoes are comfortable, but I would expect a lot more from Dockers."
1,Not the Same Old Dockers,"We were so happy to see these shoes on Amazon. My husband had a pair of what we thought were identical shoes that he wore for years and years. The soles finally wore out, and rather than have them resoled, we decided it was time to replace them, and were glad to have found the very same shoes! Or so we thought. The old pair was made in Brazil, and these new ones were made in - you guessed it - China. The fit was different, but, hey, they were brand new, and the pair they replaced were well broken in. But, less than a year later, with moderate wear, this replacement pair looks just terrible! The finish has totally worn off in strange places, and the shoes look like they're 10 years old."
2,Not this time,"I have bought these shoes in store or ordered online now for the last 4 years. They last me about 6 months. Obviously I like them - that's why I reorder them.But this time the left shoe is significantly darker than the right shoe.(It is not worth my while to send them back and I need them, so I started wearing them.)"
5,The hopes and despairs of real Russians,"This is a marvelous book about the lives of ordinary Russians in the ""New Russia"" Ingrid Bengis has the rare aqbility to make you feel you are participating in a chat around the kitchen table in a Russian apartment.With her background in Russian literature and History she brings valuable insights intoboth what has changed and what remains the same as always in Russia.As a person who has made many trips to Russia I felt in reading the book I was back with old fiends sharing their frustrations.Above all the book is beautifully written and a pleasure to read."
3,Folding camp stool,"Purchase and delivery were smooth and rapid. The item is quite small. I have not sat on it, since my caboose is larger than the track and sitting on it would be a train wreck for me. I really don't think it is worth the price. WalMart has the same type of aluminum table, a bit larger than this stool, but of the identical design, material, and construction, for less money. I think I would have been better served with some other product."
2,Its a small stool.,"This table is smaller than it looks. At 15"" high, it is just over a foot off the ground. Too small for a table or an adult chair. It would be good for kids. Alps makes a ""large"" table that is 19"" high but it is not available at amazon. Seems pretty sturdy to sit on. Lightweight."
2,Child's stool,"You need to know that this stool is very, very, VERY small. I don't recall reading in the description or advertising for it anywhere that it is a children's stool, but indeed when you unwrap it from the box, the tag hanging off says ""Great Seats for Kids...Better ""End Tables"" for Adults."" I sat on this stool for a meeting and, while it didn't feel like it was about to collapse, I would not have wanted to sit on it for more than an hour. I am not a large person - 5'3"", 135 lbs., but this stool was too small for my rear end and too short to the ground to be comfortable. I guess in a pinch you could use it as an end table, but with the slats, things are going to fall through it. My advice would be, unless you are a child, spend a little more money and get something larger and more comfortable."
4,Nice Table (not sure about a stool...),"Be advised that this is a small, short table, but great for drinks or magazines next to your camp chair. Not sure an adult could use it as a stool, but not the main reason we use it. Also, the folding mechanism is a little janky, but overall it's sturdy and easy to use."
5,Fast paced fun story in the Klondike!,"It was fun to visit with Pelagia our heroine again though this time in the Yukon during the Klondike. So many positives in this book! A face paced story that is not only smooth and well written but fun and humorous, too! Such fantastic characters that I didn't want to say goodbye at the book's close. More please!!"
5,"Smooth Feeling, Wonderful Fragrance","My wife gave me this product several years go. I have been using it sparingly because it is so kind to my ""sensitive"" skin and smelled so good. Importantly, I didn't know where I could get more. Now that I do, I can use Happy After Shave Balm more frequently, comforting my skin and getting more favorable comments like: ""You smell great!"" It is truly the best product that I have ever used as an after shave in spite of its unusual name.This sounds a little corn ball, but I really like it and it was delivered quickly as well."
1,NATURAL BORN KILLERS relives again,Okay what is it with Jason Priestley and flop movies? Coming out of Bevely Hill's you would think he is destine to be a star and now he does movies like this 'sigh'. I just seen this movie the other day and what a waste of my precious time. I feel like i been rip off and then some. The plot is like N.B.K but the direction is lost and the script is just plan ho hum...nothing to keep you interested at all. At least it didn't keep me interested and i really wanted to like it since i am a big fan of his....go Brandon aka Jason!!!!Watch it if you don't mind watching bad movies.....its so bad is not even good.
3,Watchable....Sometimes.,"I saw this film last night. It was presented as a horror feature. It was more like a poorman's Natural Born Killers. Louis Gosset Jr. has an over the top performance and Jason Priestly has a somewhat respectable performance as a psycho. If there was actually a horror element to this film, (eg. a few zombies) then perhaps the plot making sense would not have mattered so much."
2,Not worth the read,This info is all available at Wiki.com for free. Plus a lot of his info is not correct. Just not worth the money.
3,STILL READING,"I'm still reading however found beginning of the novel was more facts than dialogue. As I like more dialogue in my readings than descriptions, was getting bored. Would have kept my interest longer if it was an even mix of both. Hopefully as I get into the book it will carry my interest more."
2,Didn't like the authors style,"Didn't like the author's writing style. So I ended up putting this book down and not finishing it. Perhaps it got better after the 5th chapter, but I doubt it. I like learning about the making of horror movies, but I couldn't get over the authors writing style. It just wasn't for me. I'd go into specific details on why, but apparently a movie is coming out on this, and they didn't want bad publicity for it so they kept harassing me here and flagging my review for removal. My full review remains up on my website (Shivers of Horror), but won't be reposted here to be attacked for no reason."
4,Everything you ever needed to know about Psycho is in here -,"This book is about as in-depth as you could want, but very interesting and good reading. Stephen Rebello begins at the beginning with a rather revolting chapter about the psychotic killer upon which Norman was later loosely based. (Don't let your children get a hold of that chapter!) He then talks about the man who wrote the book ""Psycho"", and on to Hitchcock's discovery of the book and the making of the movie. There are chapters and sections on practically every aspect of the movie and the making thereof - cast, costumes, shooting, casaba melons, publicity, and the aftermath. At the end there is also a list of the entire cast and little paragraphs about what became of them after Psycho.This book is very good if you are a fan of either Psycho or Hitchcock in general, because in telling about Psycho the author tells a lot about Hitchcock as well."
3,Interesting,Too much detail except to families of film makers. Very repetitive and boring in parts. Some photos would be nice
4,Fascinating,"I'm glad the recent movie resurrected awareness of this book. Any ""Pyscho"" fan ought to find this account of its making an engaging read. Highly recommended."
4,The making of Psycho,"I learned alot about the movie making back in the fifties and about Alfred HItchcock. This was a good book, but ran alittle long in some areas. I would recommend this book."
4,A Fascinating Behnd The Scenes Look,"This book provide a fascinating look into the classic Hitchcock Film Psycho. The insights into the man and the movies provide valuable information for anyone interested in Hitchcock, Filmaking or the times the movie was mad. A worthy read."
5,Great puppet.,"My six year-old son loves this puppet. Its durable, cute and can be turned inside out. Our library has it also and it is almost always checked out."
5,upbeat and just plain fun,"This is typical mariachi fare. Good ethnic music, lively and great to listen to."
2,Still too harsh for my little one,"I was hoping this line of baby products would work for my 7 mo. old, but unfortunately it's still too harsh for her. Specifically, it made her scalp peel a bit when I used it as shampoo. It seemed to be okay for her skin, but I wanted an all-in-one shampoo and wash. Guess I'll be sticking with Cetaphil for the time being. Loved the way this smelled though so I gave it 2 stars. I'll be trying it again later on as she gets older."
1,Beware! Unidisc sells bootleg CDRs not CDs!,"I love all of D-Train's albums, but I can only give this CD one star due to the fact that D-Train's own label, UNIDISC, insists on trying pass of homemade CD-Rs as the real thing. When I buy a full price CD at retail, I expect a professionally made SILVER CD with glossy inserts, NOT what I received here: a BLUE CD-R and a tacky, cheap, homemade XEROXED insert package! Why does Unidisc try to pull a fast one on the true fans and sell CDRs as the real thing? It's misleading, dishonest, and just plain CHEAP! BEWARE! DON'T GET RIPPED OFF LIKE ME! BTW, I still think all of D-Train's albums are amazing with rich, soaring male soul vocals from JAMES WILLIAMS."
1,NOT IN STOCK,INTREPID CANCELLED MY ORDER FOR THIS. THIS IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
3,Jazz Guitar on Barbiturates,"Mark Ribot sleepwalks his way through standards, originals, and a couple of modern jazz classics. His sound is very interesting-- he uses a harsh, broke-down delta bluesy tone and seems to have deliberately detuned his guitar. This I like. The two noise pieces here are also worth listening to.But overall, this just doesn't work as an album. All of the pieces create the exact same deeply depressing mood, and the solo pieces expose Ribot as a second rate jazz guitarist (if not third rate). A few tracks might be good enough to put on a compilation, but skip the album."
1,One of the most asinine books I've seen,"After correctly stating that random events are independent of each other, the author spends the rest of the book directly contradicting this, claiming that there are ""trends,"" that some tables are ""hot"" or ""cold,"" etc. This is claiming that past random events really do affect future ones -- the book is a rehash of the old ""gambler's fallacy."" In reality, the odds on a spin of the wheel or a roll of the dice never, ever, ever, ever, change. There's no such thing as a ""hot"" table or a ""trend.""All you really need to know is the formula for EV (expected value). It is:((probability x payout)-bet)/betIf the number is negative, it's a bad bet.If you want to gamble, read some poker books, get some good poker software and practice, practice, practice. IF you're good, you can beat the rake (and the other players). All other casino games are losing propositions, period."
4,An all right DVD. Not as good as others though.,"I saw this DVD last night, all three episodes. The first episode was about Rachel's friend, Serena Sebastian, who's sister was going to marry a man who was one of three triplets. The father of Serena's sister fiance was visiting the Sebastian manor. When all is well, the power goes out just after the father of the son who's going to marry leaves. Someone is then seen with a mask smashing something with a bloddy rock. When Conan and the others go outside ther see the mashed body of Serena's sisters fiance's father. When the other two triplets come to the scene, it's up to Conan to find out which one has killed their father. It's a good mystery DVD with two other good episodes, but at times it might be a little confusing, but it was a good product!"
3,Another look at Bogey,The movie promises all the action you can stand but it wasnot what I was lead to believe. I will say that this would bea very good added VHS to someones Bogey collection. All inall a not bad.
4,Almost tantric,The a side of the original vinyl consists of several songs which form the almost tantric fifteen minutes of midnight love affair. That's the reason to buy this album. Not at all boring but more like ecstasy from the disco years. Not big beat but even more tempting groove.
4,Great ideas for arid areas,"This book has great ideas, illustrated with pictures, for water-sparing landscapes in the Southwest and California. The ideas are practical and the pictures are inspiring."
2,Landscaping in the desert? Book disappointing.,"The book covers a difficult subject, but with that in mind I found little new information. It lacks the unique creativeity I was expecting. Save your money."
3,Better be a fan to understand,A look into the beat generation and the thoughts of their leader. Spontanues poetry that's meaning is often missed in the first reading.
2,Generic video,"I bought this hoping the instruction would offer something different than the Nick Bolleteri and Vick Braden videos I have, but mostly it was just Mr. Jensen serving himself.... over and over and over again. I found nothing instructive nor entertaining in this video. I may try watching again at some point, but compared to the other videos I seen at least 15 times I really don't think it is worth the time or the money."
1,Difficult to Stay Awake,"You could read Jensen's words and get just as much from it as you can from this DVD. There are no slow motion videos of top players. There is very little demonstration of actual strokes. Jensen just talks in front of the camera, holding his racquet which he shadow swings from time to time to emphasize a point. There are much better instruction videos out there. Don't waste you money on this one."
2,Bought two discs; both have the same problem,"I first started the Pro Tennis Lessons with the Ultimate backhand a while back. The disc quality was poor. The ""dirty disc"" light flashed on my dvd player. I never have this problem with any of my dvds. Tried to clean it several time and was able to view the dvd for a few mins. I really like the coach but watching the dvd was a torture. The disc was so dirty that the pictures kept freezing on me. I finally had to give up. Two months later I bought the Ultimate Serve dvd and guess what...exact same problem...""dirty disc"". I played hundreds of dvds with my dvd player and NEVER have this problem. I really would like to watch Coach Jensen but I don't think it's going to happen with the Pro Tennis series."
5,Serving More ACES,"An exceptional lesson that has improved my first Serve's accuracy, power and consistency at least 40%. The tips and drills are easy to impliment and offer immediate results when applied. My confidence when Serving is at an all time high with winning results thanks to Pro Jensen."
5,Connect Washing Machine to Sink,"In a pinch, this gizmo can be used to hook an ordinary washing machine to a sink faucet where clothes washer plumbing isn't available."
1,Product has been discontinued?!,"The product that was received was the so called ""replacement"" Danco #10518 as the vendor has discontinued the 902 Snap Coupling. So this product will need to be updated to reflect it."
5,"A comprehensive, yet brief summary of the psi research.","My general impression for the book as a psychology graduate student is that it provides the reader with a scientificly oriented, but easy-to-understand general knowledge about the field. There is only one point that seems irrelevant to me which is the application topic. As a controversial science, parapsychology should seek and maintain a more pure-scientific orientation. My idea is that by being so, parapsychology may lead the scientific endeavor of discovering human nature more deeply and in a more multi-facet fashion.Kürsad Demirutku, Middle East Technical University"
5,Wonderul book! Clear and very informative!,"This book is written in a manner that is actually readable! It doesn't talk ""at"" you, it talks ""to"" you. The author, Richard S. Broughton, Ph.D, carries the book well. Five stars and if I could, I'd give it 10! Thank you, Dr. Broughton, for such a wonderfully written book.I would highly recommend this book."
5,Is Good,my husband is reading it but says its really good and informative. I trust his opinion because when it comes to the paranormal hes read enough books on the subject to form a worthy opinion lol.
3,Road Test compiltion,"This is another road test compilation. Decent but I wish more of tehse were in full color, especially at the price. Good research tool."
3,"It just ""ended""","I was very excited about seeing this film. It was shown as part of the Milwaukee International Film Festival and this was my chance to see a movie about which I had heard so much. There was a lot of suspense and the storyline was great but it just ""ended"". I felt a bit robbed; there should have been more loose ends tied up. Still, it was a real thriller and forces the viewer to connect the dots. It also showed the chilling effects of a pop culture generation thinking that everything said on television (and the internet) is true."
4,Guilt destroys you,This film shows people on the edge with violence exploding in a village. There's a serial killer at large and kids are the target. The people of the area are uneasy and upset. A big city TV reporter covering the story succumbs to a horrible dilemma. The actors carry off their roles well and the feel of the film is very realistic.
3,A good movie,"Cronicas is a good Latin American thriller. It has an engaging plot, good acting and a good cinematoraphy. Leguizamo's Spanish is both interesting an well done. Though the foeign language might turn off some people, give it a shot."
3,predictable and abrupt...,"Manolo (Leguizamo) is a top-rated reporter for a tabloid TV show, based in Miami. He has been reporting on the crimes of the ""Monster of Babahoya"". This ""monster"" has been abducting, raping and killing over 100 boys and girls. He has yet to be caught.Manolo is in Ecuador, filming a funeral of one boy who was murdered by the ""monster"". Not far away from the funeral, a driver accidently hits the twin brother of the boy that's being buried. The town goes into a frenzy and nearly lynch the driver.When rescued and arrested by the police, the driver, Vinicio, tells Manolo that he has detailed information on the ""monster"". Manolo is intrigued and decided to interview Vinicio.The thing is that Vinicio knows so much about the ""monster"" and where undiscovered bodies are located. So, it becomes a question of whether the ""monster"" indeed revealed everything or if Vinicio is the ""monster"".For me, it was predictable, slow and abrupt. The movie ended with more questions than answers. Ugh!"
5,AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COST,"I rented the video and when it was over I felt dirty, If you enjoy watching the poor and impoverished being victimized by the media, and this film maker, then this is the movie for you.The bottomline this is a movie about a serial killer who brutally rape and killed 150 boys and girls and with the help of John L's character's manipulating the media and withholding evidence is allowed to walks free. (by the way he runs over a boy and kills another in the end. The viewer like the families in this movie can only watch in stunned disbelief. All efforts to bring the murderer to justice is thwarted and you watch him get away. I have no idea who was the intended audience for this flickEven the alternate ending dosen't satisfyAVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COST"
2,Could have been a great recording,"I considered the only review available, and purchased, but found audibility real problem (on my Bose system). Sometimes it cannot be heard, then I have to hurry and turn it down before I blast my eardrums out. I have become familiar enough with the CD to just avoid a few of the tracks, though I wish that were not the case."
5,LOVE IT!,"i got this bag two or three weeks ago and i have been using it everyday since! i dont need to change my bags because it matchs with everything and it looks gorgeous, its easy to open and close (no zipper, just magnets)and the bag is very roomy, i can fit my huge wallet and make up and whatnot and the bag still looks fabulous. if you dont have big shoulders, it can be used as a shoulder bag, but this bag is perfect."
3,Fairly good,"It's a fairly standard conservative Christian perspective on marriage and sexuality. It was recommended to me by a friend. I found it to be helpful at times, although a lot of the material I had been aware of before."
4,Skeptically Purchased,Great book for newlyweds. It runs through a lot of important information without making it too much to take in.
3,"Okay, but...","Let me first admit that I am one of the - I presume - large numbeer of people who rush to buy all of Drake's books. (BTW, I wish he would write a book set in Vietnam, either fiction or non-fiction to get his 11th Cav days off his chest. War is hell when you're smart and have an imagination...) This one was something of a novelty. Anumber of the stories are ones Drake did for other anthologies. Thus I missed them the first time around. Some are extremely well done, some aren't so great but still a pleasant diversion. Don't get me wrong, if you like Drake read this book. If you haven't read Drake yet, start with one of the Slammer's compilations."
4,Not the whole CD,"A correction to the first reviewer who said it contained all the tracks on the CD. It doesn't - missing are the major songs: ""Cop Song"" and ""Snuff that Girl"".However, a useful guide if you are intending to produce the Musical in the future. Hal Leonard will not send the score on a perusal basis: this provides some help with your auditions and first rehearsals.I also don't think it's as hard to play, or sing, as the first reviewer thought."
4,An emotive story,This book is really interesting. The only bad thing is that I don't know a thing about baseball and I couldn't understand some parts of the book.
1,Don't Look To This Book To Solve Your Problems!,"Like many, I bought this book in 1997 and found it an inspirational love story. Apparently, others looked to the Loggins' marriage as a path for their own stability. Alas, the marriage ended in 2004 so, like so many others, it is great to give advice to others but they don't follow it themselves. Just another example for readers to look to their own souls to determine the right path and don't rely on anyone else. The only saving grace is that my wife and I married almost ten years before the Loggins marriage did and, after almost 23 years, we still are together (not perfect..at least I am not). Maybe I should write a book-my track record is better than Kenny and Julia Loggins (or,potentially, my own parents, who were married for 55 years!)"
4,Kenny Is More Than a Musician,"Even though they've separated it's a good read. While Loggins' fans want more about the songs hopefully he'll publish a book about his songs or at least a biography. Nice how he tells about how he wrote songs like ""Leap of Faith"" and others from the same album which always make me swoon every time I hear them"
4,"Winner of the $2,500 National Novella Award","When I see such blurbs I am rarely impressed. This time I am - the novel is a quiet, understated journey into a child's understanding of his family including his dead mother. The Uncle is a Texas dreamer of the best kind - always sure that his next game plan will make him rich - this time it's wild horses - while always going bankrupt. This time the game plan includes his nephew tagging along.This is not great literature in the sense that it will be read 500 years from now. But it is great fun worth rereading."
3,For older kids/beginners,"I bought this kit, and a few others like it, to teach my young daughters to cross stitch. they are very young to be learning and I knew this kit would be challenging. The pros: The design is simple and the directions clear and easily read by children. Cons: the x's are too small. I've been stitching for 33 years and found these tiny x's hard to stitch evenly. For beginners, the x's should be larger. The eye of the needle is small and hard to thread. Finally, (and I do not think this complaint is limited to these kits as I've noticed it with every kit I've bought in the past few years)...the thread is horrible. It knots and shreds very easily. My daughter lost her whole first row of stitches because of one knot. We will choose new thread in similar colors from my stash of quality threads that aren't so thin and fragile."
1,Not worth it,"The design is cute, but the thread is cheap and knots easily. I'm not a beginner and even I got frustrated with this supposedly simple pattern. The wholes are too small and the stitches don't come out evenly. I don't recommend this pattern for anyone."
1,Dolphin Cross Stitch Kit,"I would not say this dolphin kit is for beginners as I am a beginner and found it very hard. I don't think the instructions were easy, like it says. I still don't know how to cross stitch after completing the whole project. It looks awful. I am an adult and this says it's for kids, well I even found it very hard. The instructions were very confusing to me. Also the needle that is included is very tiny and it took me 2 hours to thread it. If you buy this kit may I suggest going to Walmart, or some place that sells crafts and buy a bigger needle eye. The holes are very tiny and not easy to see. I had a hard time trying to figure out where the colors go, though there is a color chart included. This kit maybe fine for someone that really knows what they are doing, but not for the beginner, not in my opinion."
5,Her best album so far!,"Having been a fan of Vonda's for some time now I was expecting great things from ""By 7:30"". I was definitely not disappointed with this collection of new material. ""By 7:30"" is an album that really grows on you, perhaps one of the other ""reviewers"" on this page should have listened to that beautiful voice a few more times before trading the CD back in at the local record store."
1,Please make zero stars an option!,I feel I paid too much and wish I could get my money back. Jarring jangly sounds - I can't call it music. Just plain awful.
5,I believe it expressed the true side of humanity!,"It has good tune, yet expressed feeling with truth, a moral C"
1,My expectations were high - too bad,"Like many others, I got familiar with Vonda Shepard through the tv serie ""Alley McBeal"". In my opinion this album is not any good, and the only great song is ""Baby, don't you break my heart slow"", the rest is just forgettable. Even `tho you might like Vonda Shepard in those little sequences when she's singing some classic tune in the bar, it's not a guarantee that you'll like this album. I didn't."
2,Voice sounds too strained.,"Never heard of some of the songs..why can't she do another album of the songs she sings on Ally McBeal? Some of the slow, romantic ballads that we recognize. Her music on Ally McBeal is far better than anything she has done by herself.Stick to the good songs!"
1,Poor presentation for Vonda.,Draining to listen to this music. Not worth the cost of the CD. One star for this performance is one star too many.
2,Very different from Ally,I have all of the Ally Mc Beal Collection and when I bought this CD I was hoping for something similar in sound.This is unfortunately not the case. Most of the songs have this underground sound that predominates over Vonda's Voice and thus make your head hurt. My recommendation: Listen before you buy.
3,A DIFFERENT STALKING MOVIE.,"THIS IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE USE TO SEEING IN A STALKING MOVIE.I WAS SURPRISED.MARK SLEPT WITH TYLERS WIFE-SO TYLER KILLED HER.NEW EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT NOT ONLY TYLER WAS AT THE CRIME SCENE.TYLER WAS SENT FREE-NO CHARGES.NOW-TYLER'S AFTER THE PERSON HE THINKS IS THE CAUSE OF HIS WIFES CHEATING.HE DOES EVERYTHING HE CAN THINK OF TO MAKE THIS PERSON PAY FOR THE CHEATING.HE GOES TO THE HOUSE.LOOKS THROUGH THE GARBAGE.HE FOUND BIRTH CONTROL PILLS-AND PUT THEM IN THE PERSONS OFFICE.HE SENT FLOWERS WITH A CARD THAT SAID "" JUSTINE ""-TYLERS WIFES NAME.HE GOT FRIENDLY WITH THE DAUGHTER.HE PUT A WEDDING RING AROUND THE DAUGHTERS NECKLACE THAT SAID "" JUSTINE "".IT'S INTERESTING.NOT SCARY OR SUSPENSEFUL.IT'S LIKE A MYSTERY MOVIE."
1,It's only for IE,"The author tell you that all scripts can run on IE and Navigator. It is true only at chapter 1. After this chapter, you have to translate the code from IE HTML to Navigator HTML by yourself; otherwise, you never see the result as shown. In my opinion, it is a good book for learning DHTML only if you are IE lover. Unfortunately, I am not IE guy."
3,Too much talking!,"My daughter and I love the Wiggles and couldn't wait to listen to this CD. The songs and music and great. The major problem is that there is a narration part between each song, and it didn't help Lauren sleep. I edited that narration out on our CD player, and it was better. I wish they would have had more songs. There is just too much talking, more than on their other CDs."
4,Great soothing songs,"My 2-yr-old daughter and I love The Wiggles, so I was excited to find a CALM Wiggles CD that might help her relax in the car. She always requests The Wiggles when we're in the car, but sometimes I want her to listen to something more ""soothing"" that will lull her off to sleep. This does the trick. The songs are calm and soothing, and she still gets to listen to her favorite group....even though she falls asleep within the first two songs! I do, however, agree with the other reviewers who said there is too much talk. It would have been OK to have it at the very beginning of the CD, but between songs? Just not necessary. It does seem to stir my daughter from her slumber occasionally. The Wiggles do a beautiful job on this CD, and yes, we do get to hear Greg's voice ""do its thing""! For those of you who have kids who love The Wiggles but get tired of hearing the same old songs over and over, this is your ticket. I was happy to find this, and I do recommend it."
3,"fun to use, a great conversational piece",I have had one of these for years and it is cheaper to buy a new one than just replace the parts. I love mine and wish they would make the parts more accessible to buy.
1,"great idea, but choose a different one","We received a similar item as a gift and loved it, so we ordered this one to give to a friend. Of the 4 dispensers, 2 did not work. Very poor quality. Choose a different brand."
5,Just as advertized,"Easy to use and arrived just as advertised. It dispenses easily and holds different sized bottles.I was afraid it might only hold the one liter bottle, but different sizes fit in the holders.It is sturdy and well made. It does not take up much room and saved us a lot of space on our smallish bar counter.The rest of the bar is beautiful so I did not want something cheap looking and this is not. It looks professional."
5,Need replacement pours!!!!!,"I have this product for about 5 years, and it still works ok!!!!Now I need some replacement pours, because I think someone threw the empty bottles with it!!!Where can I get this?"
3,"Good Gift, but maybe a little overpriced","I bought this for a friend's bday present. It is a great addition to her bar in her house, but I think it is a little overpriced for the dispenser. It's not that sturdy. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, but I had higher expectations."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this as a gift for my father for Christmas. It ticked me off when I saw how poorly it was constructed. The product is a great idea, but it leaked and the connecting metal piece between the two main pieces was woefully short. My mom moved the item and the two halves just fell apart. For 40 bucks you might as well just buy a bottle or two of liquor and pour it the regular way and save yourself some frustration."
1,not what I thought,I purchased this item because it looked like it was a nice addition to my brothers bar. How surprised I was to find out that it was just all plastic. Definitely not worth the money I paid!
1,damn things leaks...,should I return this or can you send me three replacement pours? like the size and the look and the ease of pour... but the leaking is a deal breaker
3,"Great, but leaks!","It's a great item, however one of the dispensers leaks and I can't find out how/where to get a replacement. I'd love to buy a replacement for just that one, because it's a hassle to send it back and get a whole new piece with just one of them leaking."
2,Cheaply Made,This would be a lot better if the manufacturer used better materials. I ordered the Global Decor 170 Rotating 4 Bottle Drink Dispenser but was shipped a similar one that has tiny lights on top that require TWELVE AAA batteries!! It is not as sturdy as it claims. Eveything is made with plastic. It looks and feels cheap. I dont know if I will even put it out on my bar.
2,Cheaply Made,"If the manufacturer used a better material, I will pay a little more to have it. 1/2 is made with plastic, it looks and feels cheap."
2,Great Performances But Falls Flat in the Packaging,"The problem with this series of guitar instructional material is the lack of accurate tab. In the case of this particularly DVD, there is no tab; just a little useless booklet that gives a guide to notation and lists the chords used in the songs. Also, it is advertised as giving a complete breakdown on playing the songs. This is true except for the last one, Sen-sa-shun which is played straight through with the closing credits.On the positive side, Duke Robillard's performance of the songs is superb and very inspiring, particularly The Stumble. I recommend this to die-hard Freddie King fans and advanced guitar players but the lack of tablature will probably be a source of frustration to beginners."
1,AAARRRGGHHH!!,"Avoid this one!Too much misinformation, misbeliefs, wrong spelled names and ""sics"".Has mr. Brooks paid ever attention to Zappa?Why someone has wrote the book like this?"
1,Guide is not worth more than retail,"Whoever the used (second party)sellers are for this guide, they should be ashamed for jacking up the price. There are plenty of free guides and walkthroughs for this game. Just use a search engine; they're easy to find. Don't waste your hard-earned money on something that you can get for free."
5,its an amazing dreamcoat,"this is what my brothers and i were always reaching for on the andy williams show. never quite got there. although, we came pretty close with mollie A."
2,Could any ending have been more absurd?,"Harris makes Hannibal Lechter a superman, which is really pretty silly. But he turns Clarice Starling into some absurd, undisciplined character and then creates an ending which is amongst the worst endings of the decade! I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"", and there were parts of this book which had the same wonderful feeling of anticipation and dread. But it was nowhere near Silence for reasonably believeable characters. And the ending...! Too stupid for words...."
1,Brutal disappointment,"Hannibal Lecter was a very interesting supporting character in ""Red Dragon"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Unfortunately, Harris fell in love with the character, and distorted Lecter badly in this sequel. Previously, Lecter was an unmitigated villain, a monster who, though witty, well-educated and having good taste, was a murderous cannibal who killed people because it amused him to do so.Now he kills only people who deserve to die. Hannibal the Cannibal has been forcibly transmogrified into Hannibal the Hero, and the author into Harris the Hack. The ending of ""Hannibal"" is absolutely horrendous, a brutal attack on the sensibilities of the reader and on the character of Clarice. It's snide, arrogant and heartless; in my experience as a reader, this is the most sadistic attack on the readers of the book I have ever encountered, and by very far, the worst ending."
4,arc the lad :),"i was worried at first having played the Arc the lad games but i found this a really good dvd series and would recomend it to anyone.it is based upon a young hunter called Elk, more than Arc, but incorperates parts of arc the lad and arc the lad 2 the games into it very well.as a whole series it is 6 disks and is great from start to finish, however it may not appeal to everyones tastes. though it is true that the lead character Elk can be rather annoying and self pitious it is more than made up for in other aspects of the story."
1,Does not deserve such a high price,"This was my first lap top and had to throw it in garbage in one year after facing many problems. I bought it considering Sony brand , but now realized that Sony is worst when it comes to laptops.- Lap top base gets so hot that it can burn your skin and you can not work while keeping in your lap.- Battery back up is less than 90 minutes even when laptop is new- Key board is flat , not comfortable and very fragile (can break very easily)- Over all the laptop is not at all sturdy and different parts (such as side panel in my case) can come out very easily.I would advise not to spend $1500-$2000 for this as there are various other good laptops available in this price range."
1,Unreliable,I have had the misfortune of purchasing this laptop. I have had to send it back twice to Sony for repairs. Once for the keyboard and the other time for the cd-drive. To say the battery life is terrible would be an understatement. Your money and patience would be better served with another brand of laptop.
2,2 stars for price only,"Price was right, fit the truck fine. But, broke after 6000 miles and left me stranded 3 hrs from my powerless house after hurricane Sandy. I was trying to acquire a generator. That was a rough few days. Either way, the mechanic was convinced I had a pulley issue but after exam I did not, just a faulty belt."
1,Don't buy for Sig 239,Way too small for Sig 239. Threw it out. So much for premium Bianchi brand. Bought an inexpensive Mikes Holster. Great
4,Cute but awkward,"I really like the looks of this hen puppet, which we bought because we keep hens and we thought it would be a fun way to introduce our baby to the hens. However the beak is very small so it is hard for my husband to get his hand in it (less hard for me but still not a comfortable fit) and the fact that the armhole is in the top of the body rather than the back or bottom is awkward. Still the best option on Amazon though!"
5,"Plush Red Hen Puppet 15""","I LOVE this puppet! I am using this puppet in a pre-school program to tell the story of the Little Red Hen. The children love it, too. She takes lots of loving and petting from the kids and she keeps on clucking. I highly recommend this little hen."
1,HORRIBLE DESIGN!,"I just got my Red Hen puppet...What a disappointment! She looks GREAT...IF...you want a stuffed toy. If you want a hand puppet...it's useless! The hand hole is on top of the back between the wings. This makes absolutely no sense. Looking at the picture, the most logical place to expect the hand hole is somewhere on the underside of the body. The hole placement makes even less sense, because it makes the puppet extremely awkward to manipulate. I'm returning it."
1,Tiny,Just incase you did not look at the size or the power of this it is tiny and doesn't have much get up and go!!!!
5,A pleasant suprise,"I must agree with other fellow reviewers on this one. The book about London is truly excellent book. Young Sverre Johnsen is gifted explainator and, I could say very good narrator of whites discussed strategies, and GM Kovacevic had been a guarantee of line viability and profound knowlege of the opening as its greatist practisioner in last 4 decades of playing it. I myself had been an avid spectator at Solin 2001 tournament (I live in Split which is 6 km apart) where he played a game Kovacevic-Kozul (Kozul is current european chess champion for 2006) and he crushed Zdenko Kozul with 2.Lf4 in under 30 moves (i think).I reccomend warmly this book, and it may especially be good to black french players because of its familiar pawn structures.P.S. If u dont know the caliber of Vlado (Vlatko) Kovacevic, just watch his game vs Bobby Fischer at Zagreb 1971, where he beats Bobby with french defence. It was a shocker that year."
5,First class openings manual written with passion and expertise,"This is a terrific repertoire book for white, with a co-author (croatian/yugoslav grandmaster Vlatko Kovacevic)who is a world expert on the system, and has been winning with it for decades.Many players already hate facing this system with black. They are going to dislike it even more soon, after their opponents read this book. In ""Win with the London System"" the authors advocate some subtle move orders for white (such as an early bishop development with Bf4 on move two) cutting down black options.Faced with unusual problems it is clear that Black can easily slip into deep trouble if he responds inaccurately. There are many interesting and new ideas presented here, in a style that is refreshingly honest and undogmatic.Excellent book."
5,An excellent book on the London System,"This is the first major look at the London System, which is actually a set of very similar lines. If you already play the London or are looking for an all-purpose system then this book for you. The team author concept works well here where Norwegian amateur Johnsen provides the organization and communication skills and veteran Croatian GM Kovacevic a lifetime of experience and analytical skills. Personally, I would only play the London against higher-rated or slightly lower-rated players because of its drawish tendencies, just my opinion :)."
2,Disappointingly slanted,"The book has some good explanatory text, but for a book that seems to purport to be ""the"" book, or something approaching it, it is remarkably unobjective. There are around 30 games in this book - ALL of them wins for White! Give me a break, the London System is a marginal opening at best, and Black's results are not at all bad. ""The main danger for Black"", as John Cox so justifiably states in ""Dealing With d4 Deviations"" (A MUCH better book), ""is not equalizing, but trying too hard."".I cannot recommend this book; if you want a good d4 deviations book, try the Cox book. Certainly the London System doesn't merit nearly 200 pages..."
3,Asimov -- brilliant but difficult,"Isaac Asimov is surely a brilliant scientist and an expert his subject, biochemistry. But that doesn't translate to easy and clear reading nor a smooth flow of ideas. Asimov goes off into so many side tangents, often for 10 to 20 pages or more, that it is extremely difficult to follow his primary ideas that led to the tangents. I found this book very abstruse and poorly written. I wouldn't recommend it to the casual reader, and I was in a college course that required it. The tedious details that Asimov goes into are entirely unnecessary, in my opinion, and that contributes to the almost 900 pages of pedantic and excruciatingly boring science history. He's a terrific science fiction writer but forget about this way-too-long tome. It will put you to sleep."
4,Old but fun,"For anyone who is a fan of Asimov, this is a great insight into his perspective. While I wouldn't replace a Brian Greene non-fiction book with this, I would recommend that fans of science fiction pic this up and use it as an encyclopedia of sorts rather than just skimming over parts of whatever book that you are just guessing about. It will help you visualize/understand/contemplate what the author might be talking about. Asimov gives many thorough and honest attempts to explain concepts and phenomena to people in understandable terms. For everyone else, just know that this is NOT a physics textbook."
2,"Not really a ""guide""","If you're an intermediate mandolin player don't buy this book, like other reviewers have stated it is strictly targeted to advanced players.The transcription of both melody and specially accompaniment seem to attempt to capture the fluidity and richness of the actual live interpretations, making every measure forever changing and evolving from the last one...since there's so little repetition and the pacing of the songs is so fast, both tab and notation are really hard to either learn or follow along.The cd its actually pretty good, and I would give that four stars, but if I wanted a music cd I would've bought one...I really just wanted to learn the instrument."
5,Learning to make cloth dolls,I was very impressed with this book. The instructions are explained in a way that a beginner can understand them. I am thrilled how from one simple cut out (the first one) how many didderent looks you can create. It is so much fun because I do not get frustrated trying to figure out the instructions. I look forward to making more advanced dolls. The book was shipped out promptly and arrived in excellent condition. The price was fantastic. It would make a very nice gift also.
4,Ochen Harasho,"Why is this movie so hard to find? It's very good- I watched it with my college Russian club, and was really amazed by the quality of the cinematography and depth of the storytelling. Pushkin would be pleased. For a recent big-budget Russian film, I've had an awfully difficult time securing a copy. If you can get your hands on this DVD, grab it."
2,Drill bit seems to be the wrong size,"The masonry bit included with the 3/16 screws is 5/32 (the bit is only 1/32 smaller than the screws). No matter how carefully I tried to make the hole into the concrete block, it was always too large. The screw was not tightly placed into the concrete. I avoided using a hammer setting, hoping the holes would be smaller.What was the TAPCON manufacturer thinking? Holes drilled into concrete are not exactly precision rounds.These screws are EXPENSIVE. Now I have to go shopping for a set of tiny masonry bits?update (2 weeks later):My final solution was to use two drill bits. I use an 1/8 bit to make the full-depth hole, and then I use the 5/32 bit but only to a depth of about a 1/2 inch. This works, but requires the use of two drills. Tapcon was supposed to avoid that hassle"
3,So Bad It's Good,"This movie has a budget of 2 cents as well as some really bad acting. It looks like it was made by Ed Wood, which makes it better than it seems. Plus, any film with Cyndy Preston can't be all that bad."
5,Best investment I ever made . . .,"I've had this vacuum for 2 years now, and it's the best investment I've ever made. I have carpet and hardwood in my house; the vacuum heads switch easy to transition from one to the other. They both do a GREAT job. Has not lost suction at all over time. Extremely agile and lightweight, with a nice handle for carrying up the stairs. Fantastic for pet hair; I have 3 cats and a dog, no hair problems in my house. The only possible con would be that it falls over easily if you're not careful to snap it upright (generally no big deal). Worth every penny."
5,camera collector . . . you NEED this book,"Jason Schneider has written more about collectible cameras than anyone (though British author Ivor Matanle comes close). His monthly (now bi-monthly in Popular Photography) columns in Modern Photography on camera collecting are, for most of us, the fountainhead of camera collecting information. These columns are collected in a three book set, too long out of print.Though very opinionated, perhaps even curmudgeonly in tone, these essays are cram-packed with information that can not be found anywhere else. Look forward to hours of enjoyable reading about old cameras and collecting.If you are interested in camera collecting you MUST have this set. Unfortunately, only available used.Highly recommended! Two thumbs WAY up!"
5,Must read,The Camera Collector series is the reason I have a modest collection of vintage cameras. I read these all through the 70's in Popular Photography and found myself going to Jason's column before reading anything else. It was great to find there three compilations. It brought back a lot of old memories and a lot of good reading. It is interesting even if you are not a collector.
2,Krushevo,"While their musical ability is not in question, this CD was a major disappointment for me. I was hoping for a much more traditional interpretation and for me the arrangements were far too slick and, for want of a better term, commercially oriented. If it were possible to return the item simply on the basis that I didn't like it, I would request my money back."
2,Chemical Dependency,This book is your typical text book. It is very dry and fact based but has good information. This book is a great choice for a professor to use.
1,Pages are misplaced!,"I received this book to finish up my RN-BSN online studies. As I was writing a paper, I noticed that when I was done reading one page, when I went to the next, the two did not correspond information wise. Upon closer inspection, the whole book is jumbled! Example: I would reading page # 60, and then the next page would be #71! Makes writing my papers really fun! NOT!!! Hopefully this is just the one bad book out of the entire batch!"
2,Not what I expected,"It's my fault, should have noticed it was not the most recent edition, upset when I got it. The books is what I ordered, but be sure (especially if this is a textbook that you're ordering) that you are getting the correct edition, this one is from the 1980's and most of the information is pretty out of date."
5,Excellent presentation of Baptist Distinctives,"The first 4 Chapters are worth the price of the book. Great presentation on the historical position of Baptists toward the Word of God, the priesthood of all believers, and the ordinances. The author is a little weak on understanding the autonomy of the local church (he comes from a strong SBC background) but overall it is a great book."
5,Great Book by a great man!,"Every Baptist needs to read this book to discover why they are Baptist, especially those from the CBF. Yes, most Baptists have no idea why they are Baptists and what differentiates them from other christians, especially from the liberal CBF. This book written by Dr. Stan Norman, professor of Systematic Theology at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, will make clear exactly what is a Baptist. Dr. Stan Norman is one of the finest theological minds of this century."
5,Delectable recipes perfect for the wheat and gluten-free!,"As a person who must avoid gluten, desserts are the thing I miss most. Try one of these and you'll think you were in heaven. I prepare these recipes for company and special events and everyone has enjoyed them. They are truly fine examples of the best European desserts! * Hints* The author calls for grinding the nuts in a hand mill. These are expensive and hard to find. I use a coffee grinder instead and have had no problems. * For celiacs- beware of the instruction to dust the pans with spelt flour--use another GF flour instead. Please yourself and your guests with flavor and style!"
5,excellent book,This is an excellent source of the nut flour recipes that were traditionally used in many European countries for many years.
2,Watch out - many recipes contain gluten,"The book jacket on this book states that the recipes are suitable for those with wheat gluten allergies. When I read the recipes, I discovered that many of the recipes contain spelt flour. Spelt is a form of wheat. We are gluten intollerant, and no recipe with spelt would ever be OK on a gluten-free diet. If you are also gluten intollerant, plese be careful if you decide to try the recipes in this book."
2,Not Dairy Free,"I am allergic to wheat and choose a vegan diet. I purchased this book due to the summary and fabulous reviews only to find that the title of this book is completely innaccurate. It is NOT dairy free, but instead it is lactose free. Most of the recipies call for at least 4 eggs and often they're separated, which makes it difficult to use egg replacer. The use of nuts is an excellent alternative to flour and I feel that this book is suited to persons with a wheat allergy. However, this book is not suited for those that choose to live dairy free."
1,Yet Another Reservation,"For those who are truly wheat and dairy intolerant, this book is rather a taunt than a solution. It is of little solace for anyone who is allergic to eggs, and many people who are allergic to wheat are also likely to be allergic to nuts. It is a parade of all the delicious things one cannot have."
3,Last Night of The Proms,"I was disappointed with this CD, in so far, as it is not really 'the last night of the Proms' from the Royal Albert Hall, as I was seeking.Should have gone for the more expensive CD with Colin Davis. There wasn't the whistling, cheering, singing of the usual last night crowd.But the music is fine and some are sung and the words are on the package, which is good."
4,Pro Tennis Lessons -- Ultimate Volleys,I found the lessons extremely helpful and the two or three suggested practice sessions worthwhile.
2,Maybe Not...,"Duke is a wonderful guitar player. No question about it. This is NOT a wonderful instructional DVD. Too many camera angles that don't show what he is playing. I can live without onscreen Tab (though I prefer it) but at least show me what it is that I'm supposed to be learning. Split screen would be nice (right and left hands) but at least show me straight-on shots of the fretboard. This may be a good DVD for those who can pick things up by ear alone, but those people can just listen to CDs right?Oh well..."
1,Misleading Title,"This is not a book about bears, this is a book about the authors, their problems and emotions--and about Mr. Russell's plane... What they have to say about the bears they set free would barely fill one chapter in all.If you really want to know what it's like to raise orphan cubs in the wild, if you want to know about bear behavior, bear biology, and how to teach people to coexist peacefully with bears, read Benjamin Kilham's book ""Among the Bears""."
1,If you are a beginner then you are ahead of this book!,"If you are beginner and wish to increase your Query/400 education... sorry, you can get very little added knowledge from this book over the help that Query/400 offers. If you have any programming skills (or just a modicum amount of logic) then save your money. Nothing is offered here that justifies half it's price. (Zero stars if it were possible)"
5,Absolutely wonderful,I have had the privilege of dining at the Elmwood Inn and meeting the authors of this book. I have personally made most of these recipes and they are absolutely wonderful. Will make your tea party forever memorable.
3,Choir and music is fantastic - the balance on the CD is not.,"The Organ is well played and the choir sings beautifully. The problem I have with this CD is no the group or the performance but the balance and volume levels set when the CD was created. First the volume on the CD is so low that I have to crank my sound system really high to be able to hear most of the tracks. Also, the balance between the choir and organ is off such that often times I can't hear or understand the choir because the organ is too loud (even though the organ itself is being played softly). The itunes version has a much better balance of the same recordings."
5,Requiem,"I had to sing the Requiem in a concert, and I have to say that this reecording helped me alot and I also listen to the music (and sing along sometimes)"
4,Good easy listening sing along songs,"I like the way Mitch Miller sing these songs, I like the lyrics, I like the orchestration and it is a good choice of easy listening songs. So, it is a good CD to buy."
3,Great sing-along for kids - wide range of songs with spirit,Fun songs that are easy to memorize because they are funny. Something totally different.
1,"What good memories this brings back, NOT!!!","My Dad played this lp over and over again. Now that he's in a retirement home I can finally burn the thing!!! This should never have been made available on cd, this isn't even good in a bad way liek esquivel or Guy Lombardo, this isn't even good enough to pass as camp, it's just unmusical and lame..."
5,Cross Cake,"Made a beautiful Easter cake. We made a Velvet Red Cake with White Icing. (red for the blood of Christ,white for our sins washed away)"
1,CHEAP!!,"This pan is so cheap, when I got it, it had deep scratches on it already and the coating was peeling off. Plus it's very thin if I would have used it I would have had to be very careful to not burn whatever I was baking, I've tried thin pans in the past and they're usually always aweful. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. I like Wilton brand usually but this was bad."
5,Made a gorgeous cake,"I'm not a cake artist by any means, but was able to easily make a First Communion cake, using this pan, and it turned out wonderfully. Only problem I found was that the instructions attached to it were in spanish, no English, so I had to kind of guess as to how many cake mixes to put in. I was making several other cakes, so I had plenty of batter and just filled it 3/4 of the way. Would purchase wilton product again!"
2,Disappointed!,"I like mariachi music, and this is by far not the best I have listened to.The recordings seem to be ancient and the orchestra is very mediocre.There is better Mariachi music out there, don't waste your money!"
3,Hymns in Spanish,"I do enjoy listening to this CD occasionally but it's more a collection of hymns that have been translated to Spanish than modern worship songs. But it's great to hear some of those old, old songs in Spanish for a change. :) Some of the included songs are ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"", ""This is the Day"", ""Look What the Lord Has Done"" & ""I Went to the Enemy's Camp..."".I listen to Spanish songs all the time and we use some of these at my church. However, we like to use more modern songs most of the time so just be aware, if you're like us, that these are not your modern worship songs (for the most part)."
5,This book will keep you prisoner until you finish it.,"If you like historical romance with a twist of darkness, this is the book to read. The author brought every one of the significant characters to full bloom. Her characters personalities unraveled more and more as I read on. I felt the joy and disappointment of Rowena, the confusion in Sir Gareth, the weakness of Lindsey, the courage of Little Freddie. I felt each emotion as I read the lines.This book made me miss my stop on the subway while going to work one morning. Now that's a sign of a great book...trust me.Kudos to Theresa Medeiros...keep up the great work."
1,Terrible,I was so dissapointed. I have read one or two Teresa Medeiros books before and found them entertaining. This book was so poorly written that there were times I didn't know who was speaking or whose thoughts I was reading. If I was new to reading I may think it was me. I stopped caring about any of them by chapter 4.
3,Alright just so so,"This book was an alright book. It was one that I brought for my trip to England. The charaters were fun it just seemed like they were missing something. It was predictable, but I still read it anywho. It's your classical t.m. book and I always enjoy reading them!"
2,not her best,"I have to admit that I was left totally confused after finishing this book. The premise of the plot was promising, unfortunately the characters were not. Gareth was supposed to be this dark and brooding medieval knight with a tortured background to justify his dark character, unfortunately he came off as simply mean and selfish. The things he did to Rowena in the name of revenge was horrible. Rowena was also a confusing character, one minute she was fiesty, then she turned into whimpering girl consumed with lust after a touch, a kiss, or a look from Gareth. I simply don't get the attraction Rowena felt for Gareth. Worst of all, there's not one word of regret from Gareth's mouth to Rowena for all the humiliation and degradation he did to her. Marlys was creepy. All in all, not her best."
2,ok - i love Teresa Medeiros but this one was just odd.,I know it was her first novel and all - but it feels like she had a bunch of great romance ideas and then bunched them all together. The book itself is enjoyable to read - but it doesn't read smoothly - at least for me. The odd sister character - Marlys (sp?) was a HUGE turn off - very very annoying and abrassive. I found myself reading the story to figure out what the big plot twist really was instead of being so wrapped up in the hero and heroine tormenting each other. blah. It's still a keeper though in my opinion only b/c it's so rare and i'm a huge Medeiros fan.
2,Not Medeiros' best!,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Teresa Medeiros fan. I am constantly on the look out for her books but I'm sorry Teresa, Shadows and Lace did not do it for me. I was actually reading a book where I didn't like the main characters! The heroine was wimpy and the hero was mean. Sigh. If you are reading Teresa Medeiros for the first time, do not start with this one."
2,disappointing!,"She really writes wonderfully but, she lost me with this novel. The plot is fine and the main characters are well but too much plot twisters that you become dizzy reading it. Simplicity was needed for this story not twists and turns. It's nothing like ""The Beauty and the Beast"", now that book is a page turner!"
1,awful!!!!!,"I have to say am the biggest fan of Teresa Medeiros, but I was sorely dissapointed at the characters in this book...they totally lacked character! If you are a big fun of teresa medeiros then I wouldn't recommend this book...it's not her best."
2,Repetative!,"The book is beautifully written and the characters are seemingly beautiful but the herione Rowena is a moron.She commits the same mistake over and over again. You think that after running twice and being caught by Sir Gareth she would try something different for a change.For a main character, she definitely needs more work or brains... Even the supporting characters seem to have more life.Get the book for the other characters and or (if you don't have it already), purchase ""Heather and Velvet"" (same Author) instead."
4,Blew me Away!,I couldnt put this book down. 2nd in Sue Henry's series set in Alaska. A canoeist finds a journal set 100 years in the past of a journey to find gold. He is set upon by the bad guys and the book takes off from there. Alex Jensen and a Canadian Mountie are called in to investigate and work hand in hand to solve this intricate but fascinating plot.Sue Henry writes one good mystery with a little romance thrown in to the mix. I read this thru a New England snow storm and enjoyed it immensely.(The book; now the snow storm :))
4,A Mystery The Way It Should Be Told,"Sue Henry knows how to put a good mystery together. Puzzles within puzzles with a very satisfying conclusion. The characters who people her stories are so well developed they seem real. All in all, a very enjoyable read."
3,Mild,"Not as strong as I'd hoped for. Did better at the grocery store with a stronger product. Oil of oregano is worth a try, however."
4,Great product!,"I have had head congestion constantly for the past 27 months. Have been to many different doctors (some specialists even) but to no avail. This product really clears my head out. Burns a little when you first spray it, but well worth a little discomfort to get relief. I highly recommend this product for anyone with sinus/allergy/unknown cause head congestion."
3,First book was better,"French Women Don't Get Fat was wildly successful, and I think the publishers and Ms. Guiliano were trying to repeat history with this book. It's not terrible, but it lacked the originality, authenticity, and character that drew me to French Women Don't Get Fat."
4,Enjoyable read,"This book was such a nice reminder to fully enjoy the diversity of each season and to immerse yourself in what is unique about each moment throughout the year. It brought back memories of seasonal treats from my own childhood in French Louisiana. Reading this also recommitted my resolve to eat local produce as much as possible. This book is the perfect sequel or companion read to ""French Women Don't Get Fat."" Mirielle expands on many of the concepts and ideas she introduced in her first book with recipes, additional explanations and practical tips for focusing on life's pleasures to stay healthy not only in body, but in mind and spirit as well."
4,Oh To Be French..,Enjoyable reading...love to see how the French think...humorous...good recipes. I like this author.
4,Good book,"This book is very interestingand fun to read, filled with good recipes and lifestyle advice."
5,French Women for All Seasons,I loved this little book with suggestions which real women could use. The diet ideas make sense and the recipes are wonderful..Mireille Guiliano is a breath of fresh air in the miriad of self help and alternative eatting books which have flooded the market. Merci to her and the wonderful French culture.J.K.Colorado .
4,Love French Women,I have read all of the books in the series. I enjoyed this one. It was fun and offers practical advice in addition to enticing and tasty recipes. An enjoyable read with advice worth listening to.
2,Big disappointment after the first book!,"I LOVED her first book and eagerly anticipated this one -- but now I wish I'd taken it out from the library instead of buying it. It's classic Second Book Syndrome (throw together a sequel to cash in on the success of the first one). I'm so uninterested in it that I'm only about 2/3 of the way through it, even though I've owned it for months. Most of it is just ruminations about her life (not terribly interesting) and a lot of recipes for things that I have no desire to make (frog's legs, rabbit, sorrel, chestnuts, etc.). The book desperately needed some illustrations, which might've made the recipes seem appealing -- and certainly would have made the scarf-tying directions more worthwhile. What a letdown. I'm only giving 2 stars to be nice."
5,fabulous read,"This book is as good as the first one. You want to go back for more, and live a better life because of it. Lots of very good information on life itself. If the author writes another I sure will buy it too. The receipes are also very good."
4,Pleasant Read,"I really enjoyed this book - it is a great lifestyle read that doesn't just focus on losing weight. I liked the blend of recipes, childhood memories, clothing advice, flower arranging tips, wine tasting lessons, cheese tasting information - it was an interesting read that was informative and not preachy. Buy it just for the discussion of enjoying food and wine (and how to pair both - she really goes into detail and, of course, knows her stuff)."
3,At Least She Admitted She Was Chauvinistic . . .,"Who doesn't envy the author's lifestyle? No matter what country is one's chief cultural touchstone, Guiliano's privileged lifestyle hardly speaks to everywoman. To her credit, she admits this many times throughout the book, and her own French chauvinism. A great deal of time and attention went into the preparation of this book. It would be an excellent introduction to managing one's diet, lifestyle, wardrobe, hostessing, etc. to a very young woman. But, as a woman the same age as the author, I rankled a bit at the endless ""how-tos"". The numerous references to the benefits of drinking Champagne were a sly bit of product placement considering her position with Veuve Cliquot."
2,Boring,"If I had not read the first book, this might have been interesting. As I had read the first book, this was just more of the same. I felt as if the author thought American women were incapable of acutally stopping and smelling the roses, as if we were all machines not stopping to be the least introspective or appreciative. It was actually insulting. I appreciate many things daily, stop and enjoy many moments and special treats. The French author is trying to squeeze the last nickle out of her story by a rehash!"
2,This is a little tiny book.,"I wasn't expecting to receive a little tiny book, like a children's book, in the mail. There's very little information in it and almost none of Matisse's drawings. Very disappointing. I don't like it."
3,Hawkwind - 'Ridicule' (Obsession),"HEAR,YE!HEAR,YE!ALL YOU HAWKWIND COMPLETISTS OUT THERE,HERE'S YET ANOTHER compilation disc that you simply cannot live without.For quite a while now,I wasn't sure as to exactly what THIS disc was all about.I've cross-referenced all five(5)tracks in the 'Illustrated Collector's Guide To Hawkwind' book that once came with a copy of their 'Warrior On The Edge Of Time' CD reissue(see my review)and it's affirmative.Each of these tunes come from the 'Space Ritual II' disc.More or less,merely an edited down version of that CD.Nice artwork,though."
2,Kids size tackle box,I thought I was getting a full size box. I really wish sellers would put measurements of their produscts.
5,it was a gag gift,I bought the sticker as a gag gift to go with a fishing kit I purchased for someone for father's day.
3,Stickerless Sticker,"I prepped the surface, cleaned it thoroughly, even sanded the spot down a little bit to rough it up. The sticker just wouldn't stick. I ended up using super glue to hold it on there. Quality of the graphic on the stick was fine, but the adhesive on the back needs some work and attention."
2,Suprisingly small,This item is very small and cramped for space. It looks bigger in the photos. I went to WalMart and bought a decent sized tackle box.
3,Tackle box,This item was much smaller than I expected. However it was good quality. Had lots of organizational space in it.
4,"Great size, poor handle design","Love the size of this box, unfortunately the handle is poorly designed in that it wants to pop out of it's hole that keeps it in place...it did this when I was taking it out of the packing box."
4,Great little storage holder,"Overall, this is a nice storage holder. I bought it so I could have a place to store my daughters costume jewelry as I wanted the clip-on earrings to remain in one set location. This little box works. It is smaller then it looks online, and the top compartment only holds two additional storage holders, but it does work for the price you pay. The plastic is a bit cheap too, but for my needs it will hold up until I find something better."
3,Broken :(,"I was excited for this to arrive, only to see that one of the securing handle things was broken. So I had to return it. It is quite small but it would have been enough for what I needed it for. The broken thing to this day still disappoints me. But at least i didn't have to pay for returning it or anything. :("
5,Not just for tackle,"I bought 3 of these and not for tackle. I use them to organize my picture hanging hooks, furniture repair items and I just bought one for my mom to organize her beads and other jewlery making items. They are handy, light, and perfect for organizing any small items."
4,4/5,"I just got this tackle box yesterday, it works great. I am not an expert fisherman so i dont need a lot of lures and stuff, but if you need a good size tackle box to hold all of your stuff get something like this, here is the link:[...]You may need a seperate case for knives and tools and stuff. Overall though it is a great tackle box just small."
5,"A great box ""small"" box.","This tackle box is a great little box. I put some of my tackle in had in it and keep it in my trailer just in case I come across somewhere to fish while we are out camping.As listed in other reviews, this is a small box. I too originally thought I was buying a larger box so look at the size before you buy.The box does offer a lot of storage for jigs, flies, spinners, lures, hooks and weights. If you are looking for a box to hold your crank bait, Rapalas and rubber worms you may want to look for a larger box than this one."
1,Way smaller than expected,Dont think that you are buying a nice size tackle box....This tackle box is about the size of a standard 2 bread slice toaster. I am completely disappointed in the size. It looks like a toy rather than a tackle box for true fishing. Buy a different product if you want to take a bunch of tackle with you fishing! Beware!
3,Gritos de Muerte y Libertad,"Pretty good, not too bad in history, some of the locations and wardrobe were not realistic. Entertaining movie, could have been better, at least in my opinion."
2,not much to learn..here,"save your money and just tape tennis on tv. jensen trys but there is very little instruction, there are hours (?) of repetitive shots..over and over with very little instruction. (p.s.--why sooo expensive?)"
3,"More about persont, less about art",It was more detailed about his life and less detailed about his art. I would have preferred more about art and less analysis of her personality.
3,there are better toys,"this toy seems cooler than it is. i think at the end of the day it doesn't have the most pleasant chew experience - kind of taut fabric, not soft, no give. but my dogs are kind of picky. they like soft stuffed animals"
1,Did not last,My teacup Maltese destroyed in one day. Did not last at all. Cute but not sturdy enough for even a little dog.
3,Puppy loved it! Not very durable though,"I purchased this for a 13 week old shihpoo...and she loved it! It squeeks and has all the loops for her to drag it around with. However, it went into the trash within two months because it started to split at the seams. So much for the durable canvas. I would recommend any of Petstages Orka Minis for small dogs that like play hard and chew."
5,great toy,"Big and small, my dogs love this toy. I got this for my two little guys but the big girls keep taking it and becomes a chase and steal game for them. To play, I get the ball, squeek it and throw. If it's just the small dogs, we play fetch and tug of war. It's easy to hold on to the loops. I wouldn't recommend it for large dogs. For the life of me, I can't figure out how it's held up with the big dog's play."
2,Not so sure about this one,"I ordered this along with some other toys for my eight 5 week old puppies I am raising. I thought that they would tug on the handles the way they play tug'o'war with everything else. However, so far I have not seen them do much more than chew on it or carry it around. Maybe in a few weeks they will use it but so far it is just sitting in their puppy den collecting dust."
1,Petstages toy,"This toy is very small, but it's the perfect size for my yorkie. However, the stuffing started to show after only a couple of days. This is the second Petstages toy that I've bought my puppy that's torn up after only a short time. Won't be buying anymore."
5,My Yorkies Love this Toy,"My 2 yorkies (1 about 1 yr old (4 lbs); the other 4 mos old (1 lb)) love this toy. The perfect size for them and has held up to their constant chewing and fighting over it. It has a squeaker inside and - their fav part - is that it is really easy for them to carry it around by the loops (rather than have to get their little mouths over the entire toy). They love it. (They love most of the ""Pet Stages"" ""mini"" toys.)"
4,"S-beat me, please","THE RUNAWAY is classic. Enough said. I havent heard this album in years,(have it in storage on vinyl), and the round about beat still plays in my head. RHYTHM OF THE WORLD is like a B sci-fi movie, done disco. RUNNING IN CIRCLES is disco pop, and S-BEAT is just hop-along nonsense. (But I like it). LOVE IS, is of course, the longer version mixed from previous album, which still reminds me of that little cute cartoon that appeared in newspapers some years back. I still like THE RUNAWAY best! It was M doing a freaky Pop Muzik with the La-La-la's, and then breaking into a winding down electronical beat with no vocals, and further echoing effects of electronic nature. Viola, this album or CD was not meant to gather dust on anyone's shelf. Not if you have the speakers, imagination, and ability to mix songs at home."
5,Fun and romantic,"A terrific collection of poems, organized in a reader-friendly format that runs the gamut of emotions. There is a nice mix of familiar and not-so-familiar poets that distinguishes it from other anthologies. Highly recommended for even those who would not usually pick up a book of poetry."
4,Handi tool,"Great contour duplication gauge, I use it to transfer solid objects to drawings. the only disadvantege is those pins are not perfectly alighned."
4,Good tyre,I brought theHutchinson Python Mountain Bike Tirelight air model which originally came with my Giant mountain bike. This tyre performs well with no bad surprises but is becoming outdated with the new dual compound tyres which have amazing grip. Not recommended for asphalt riding as it wears relatively quickly.
2,not recommended,If you are a beginner to FormZ then this book might work for you. For intermediate to advanced users this book will not show anything new. What this books takes you through is something that someone can figure out on their own. It is extremely basic with instructions. This book fails to mention half of the capabilities of FormZ.
2,Not really worth it,"This book does have some errors and missing steps in it. I had to back track and sometimes make up my own ways to complete exercises when reading the book. Also some of the measurements used in the book are incorrect so make a note of that when you are using this book, that way you are not backtracking to see if you missed something. In my humble opinion, look for another book."
3,"A great book, if you own your own gym!","For those who want easy-to-follow instructions for weight training from beginner to intermediate, this is a fine book. The title is a bit misleading--while there are many exercises that you can do at home, there are some that are only doable at a gym--and with machines instead of free weights.That said, even a beginner can create a personal weight training routine that is simple but effective. The book includes ""training plans"" for a variety of levels and schedules, which is a plus. It's also not ""over the top"" in any way--almost all of the exercises are practical and easy to accomplish; you don't have to be a body builder!"
5,JL is fresh and HOT!!!,This CD is GREAT! From the moment I got it (which I got the day it came out) I have not stopped listening to it. You can feel all his songs and the message behind them are real. He tells a story and you can feel him if you listen from start to finish. I wish JL the best and I know that he will go far.If you get a chance to catch him in concert he is AWESOME and knows how to rock the house.
5,Multifaceted,"As described by the dictionary: having many facets or aspects. John Legend certainly falls under that definition as well as many others. He is just not a singer, songwriter, but a musician as well. His music has the rare combination on braun and beauty. It's heavy enough for you to stand on, yet light enough to carry you away. And that's how music should be. That's why this debut stands superior to so many others. John Legend gets it right the first time."
4,Kinky Boots DVD,"When shopping for the Kinky Boots Sound Track CD, Amazon popped up the movie DVD and I made the mistake of ordering that. It took a very nice vendor an several weeks (plus postage) to return the item.I placed an order for the CD on 6/16 and am still waiting for it. It is taking a long time."
3,just ok,Solid album but it woould be better if John Legend could sing better. His voice is not very good
2,Not what I expected,"This album is not very good at all, I was very dissapointed when I listened to this CD. It's going to be one of those CD's where it'll collect dust in my CD case. I gave it 2 stars because there is only 3 strong songs on the album out of 14 and that's including ""Used to love you"". The rest of the album is not that appealing to me. It's right up there with Alicia Keyes' album. So if you want it anyway be my guest, but I'm telling you, it's not all that fantastic."
1,never again will be to soon,"I've just heard a few tracks from this CD and I must say...if I never hear it again that will be to soon. Recommended by some people (who I used to consider my friends). I'm open to all sorts of music, but this completely boring egotrip was just plain irritating. It made me want to get up and throw out the CD, and I don't usually react to music like that, even the sort I don't like. Somebody should have told Mr. Legend (not) to try another profession."
5,WOW!!!!!!! John legend is Gifted,All i gat to say is havent even bought the album yet. by just listening to the samples from amazon makes me want go cap it right away. he is really a legend!!!
3,Maybe it wasn't for me,"This was the first CD I've purchased in about two years...i bought it after seeing John Legend on the Today morning show singing Ordinary People. I feel a little tricked because there's a sentiment behind the lyrics in most of his songs that I just wasn't expecting. (i.e. He's ""playing"" grown, talking about silly useless things.) Maybe it just isn't for me. The first half features great sound, but it falls into the same trap of every other song on the radio that features good beats but just plain idiotic lyrical thoughts. It's not all bad, but I expected more. Not everyone cares about good solid lyrics; but if you do, this CD might not be for you either."
2,Disappointed,"I love hearing John Legend sing on Duets, so I decided to buy his CD. I didn't like one song on this album, even Ordinary People. I donated this CD to my public library."
1,Don't Buy,Don't buy this dics. Its expensive and you may not be able to download it to your ipod. Check the warning in small print first.Even if the music is great. What good is a CD you can't play on your ipod.
2,Potential,"When I heard ""Ordinary People"" I thought this was going to be a great album. I don't generally listen to R&B all that much so I gave it a chance. The nice piano only accompanied by Legend's voice made it sound more natural and acoustic than anything I've heard that has been considered R&B. Unfortunately, the music, except for a few songs, sounds like almost all the other R&B I've heard; Hip-hop beats and rappers being in the songs. Even these great songs can't change the fact that this album was tarnished by popular crap that people tend to like in all cds. This cd had so much potential."
4,Too long of a wait,"Great CD! the second track ""Get Lifted"" is possibly the best song. CD kinda trails off towards the end, but all in all, it is a CD worth buying, not downloading. Plus, with Kanye behind the decks, you know its gonna have some good beats. I would call him a black version of Jamie Cullum (check him out if you like mellow songs with a piano). But while this CD is very very good, i think the delay may have hurt its success. ""Used to Love U"" was out on the radio a little too long before the CD dropped."
4,A Great Start,"When I first heard that Kanye West was behind John Legend's album, I expected a R&B album with Rap appearances, however I was wrong. John Legends album is refreshing in the way that it comes across as a true R&B album without sacrificing and artistic creativity. Someone compared him to Brian McKnight which is someone I would not compare him to, but I will say this much, he is off to a great start."
5,got 2 get,this cd should be in every collection if your gonna get a cd get this i listen to rap but i love this cd get it
2,Let's not get Carried away here,"John Legend is a talent and has a bright future, but I think people are getting carried away comparing him to people like Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye, and Curtis Mayfield.John has a wonderful sounding voice but lyrically this album is weak. The best track on this album by FAR is ""Ordinary People."" Other tracks that stick out are ""Used to Love U"" and ""Refuge."" The rest of the album is fair. He can be a legend in his own right, but not with this album"
2,Im stunned,"Next time Johnny Boy,Maybe missed somthing but this guy is no Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke, or whomever you want him to be except another hook singer signed to a album deal. Kanye West is gonna drain his talent like he drains 1980's soul samples, plus from the flow of the album you can tell that legend didn't have any creative control over the project it sounded like two completely different albums 1-7 then 8-14 (the latter would get 4 stars by its self). With the exception of ""Ordinary People"" and ""So High"" you can hang it up. Bland over discussed song topic, bluejeans and an sportscoat shouldn't get you compared to the neo-soul artist who where doing it before it became trendy. Besides I'm sick of wishing someone was like Marvin Gaye or Harlod Melvin, Isaac Hayes etc... They were great but this retro phase has taken its toll lets start loving the artist who come out today for what they contribute not who they remind you of. And maybe we will hear some music thats worth a second listen."
3,3.5 Stars,"Overall, this is a great CD. The lyrical content of some songs irk me, but overall, it's all good!"
5,Pure Talent,"Can you say TALENTED!!! I have been awaiting the release of this album since I saw him perform ""Around My Way"" with Talib Kweli on the Chappelle's show earlier in the year. The songs are simply wonderful. You can play the whole album straight through. I would also suggest purchasing his previous albums from his website. Please don't sleep on this album! You will not be disappointed!"
4,Good Debute,After reading a review in Entertaiment Weekly in which this CD was rated an A- and John Legends voice compared to Smokie Robinson and Marvyn Gaye. I couln't wait to buy this CD. Although I don't think he is as soulful as Marvyn Gay or as distinctive Smokie Robinson.Overall its an enjoyable CD and well worth the money.I enjoyed these tracks the best:Let's Get it OnStay with Youso highRefuseIt Don't Have to ChangeIt's the kind of CD that I can listen to without reaching for the remote to skip tracks. Which is why I rated it 4 stars.
3,"Good Album, but...","I wasn't blown away like I thought I'd be. I'd read other reviews and listened to friends rave about this album. It is good, don't get me wrong, otherwise I wouldn't give it three stars. What I really would like to give it is 3.5, but since that wasn't an option, I settled on three. Most of the cuts are good, but I just didn't quite get the hype. There's nothing that stands out about his voice for me. I picked up this album along with Brian McKnight's and Anthony Hamilton's latest CDs and I like both theirs better than this one. I think John Legend will have a long career, though. He's gifted. No doubt."
2,a Legend?,"This is the first cd of his I bought, and I was disappointed some of the lyrics seemed more mean-spirited and harsh than I expected/they needed to be. One of my favorite r&b (Stevie the Wonder) never utters a harsh word, but can state a negative opinion w/out offending. Maybe it's a maturity issue, either his or mine, I'm not sure."
4,good album....,"Much needed in the industry.But honestly, is it me, or is music so bad now that we ""celebrate"" artists that use a throwback style to yesteryear, but not really ""elevating"" the music to ""new"" levels?I love the honesty of this album, but it's a rehashed theme of yesteryear. Good album, but I can't think there's anything wrong with expecting black music to elevate itself to another level. This album stands out because of the trash heap it's measured against, but I can't call it ""great"" on par with the ""greatness"" of many of our 70's and 80's soul artists."
5,JOHN LEGEND IS THE MAN......BEAUTIFUL VOICE!! :),"I THINK THAT JOHN LEGEND IS A VERY TALENTED ARTIST. ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM IS GREAT. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN DO THAT ON THEIR VERY FIRST RECORD. I CAN SEE HIM BEING AROUND FOR A VERY VERY VERY LONG TIME. I LOVE HIM AND THIS CD. IT IS VERY CATCHY ALBUM, AND IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL SONGS. HE IS ONE OF MT FAVORTIE ARTISTS RIGHT NOW. I KNOW HE IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME. I LOVE HIS VOICE AND THE WAY HE SINGS...ITS SOOOOO BEAUTIFUL. I LIKE THE CD THE MOMENT I HEAR THE SAMPLES. :) HE HAS A WAY WITH WORDS AND HOW HE PUTS THEM TOGETHER IN A SONG. THAT IS A GOD-GIVEN GIFT THAT JOHN LEGEND HAS. I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THIS CD....YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
2,A Big Yawn,"John Legend's stage name is such a fallacy. Legend is definitely not something I'd call him. He has a good voice, a few good songs on this CD and that's it. Musiq Soulchild is much better buy his albums and let's forget this ""legend""."
1,BOGUS!!!,"This melo-dramatic ghetto epic tale sung with soulfull piano is such a farce!! The music tries to cameflouge the horrible lyrics!! ( I'm cheating, your cheating, don't hate me for cheating, I can't blame you for cheating!!) What is this. And to prove that all you need is a funcky beat, or in this case smooth piano and grooving melody, the American public will buy anything! Its a wolf in sheep's clothing. Posing as neo-soul!!"
2,I'm sorry brother john,you may be able to play the piano but your voice is like nails on a chalkboard which ruins the whole sound and your topics are the same old crap we hear already. If you want to hear real piano playing check out stevie wonder or even classical music cause john aint nothing
1,"Crap, crap, crap","The only thing that was lifted was this damn CD out of my player. All the hype about John Legend was a waste of pure time. I mean don't get me wrong, Kanye did an excellent job producing (as usual) but this time with the wrong person. Honestly, he has no voice, and the lyrics are whack. If a person feels the need to hear good music of the sort, spend a few dimes on Anthony Hamilton's CD ""Comin From Where I'm From"". Now this is a genuine piece of art, but once again in the music game it's who you know and not what you do."
5,///////Got Lifted/////// High ////////and I feel GOOOd,"John Legend first single was weak. I dismissed him as a cornball singer. ""Ordinary People"" was okay. I was more interested in him until, they played it on the radio 30x's a day. I saw him on the BET awards and decided to buy the CD. IT IS GOOD. HE sounds a lot like CARL THOMAS, but he is so very good. For those who like Musiq, or Jill Scott you will love John's Melody. My only beef with him as a woman is that he has too many songs about cheating.Pick up Kindred & Jaquar Wright classics"
4,A Soulful Joint,John Legend brings the soulful voice with a twist to the airwaves. Many consider him the equal to Ms. Alicia Keys they are both known to lace their music with strings from the piano and then to belt out a beautiful lyric behind it. With Kayne West and Alicia Keys back him he can't fail touring with Alicia probably help with establishing who he was but when Kayne took him on and the album dropped all I can say was it was a rap. The music has an R&B; cadence with a little Hip Hop to it while John can still be found laying the piano keys down when you hear him vocally he does well also.The first single off of the album was Ordinary People I instantly feel in love with this song I enjoyed listening to him play the piano and telling the story of love but when Number One hit the airwaves I just knew that I would always enjoyed John Legends music.
5,I love John's voice,"I bought the MP3 album because I love John's voice. Much like the late Marvin Gaye, he really knows how to use his instrument. So of course I love the slower tracks, I like hearing those pipes. Ordinary People is such a beautiful song it moves me to tears. It sounds like a live track, because his voice is rich but you can hear the scratchiness too. His accompanying skills are incredible, the phrasing is perfect, its obvious he's done his homework and studied music for years. Its rare when you have a singer that is so special but there is also a strong technique behind what they're doing."
3,alright start,"musically this album is a winner with it's piano hooks and melodies brought to you by kanye west, but lyrically it's either corny or makes you wonder if john is some kind of womanizer."
5,A Legend....,"John Legend has lived up to and surpassed expectations. I have found his cd to be motivating, captivating and soul soothing. His music takes you on a joy ride from beginning to end. Great music by a great artist."
5,A Legend in the Making,"What a amazing talent this young man is. I have enjoyed this cd so much. John Legend is reminisence of Curtis Mayfield, Issac Hayes and Marvin Gaye. Finally an artist that can sing and has staying power. This was refreshing to listen to. It is a must buy for anyone who enjoys real music. I was listening to this cd and it reminds me of a love story. He takes you from the start of a relationship throught the good times and the bad and ends it with Live it up. We finally made it. It is a love story put to music. This is the best new R&B artist out in a long time."
5,I GOT LIFTED,"I first to begin to really get into this man called legend when I saw him in concert live opening for the legendary Ms Alicia Keys. I must admit he was phenomenal, I then went to purchase get lifted. From song one all the way to the end this man is a master piece within his own right. It doesn't matter if you like R&B, Hip Hop or Jazz it has it all. This album can speak volumes to anyone it comes in contact with. Some of my favorite tracks are Ordinary People, Live it up, So high and Number one. I can honestly say this is the first CD in a while that I have been able to put in the player and listen to and enjoy from the beginning to the end without hitting the skip button. It is an investment in anyone's music collection."
2,Not uplifted by 'Get Lifted',I was very upset when I got this cd I was so happy that finally after being heard all over kanye west's cd he had a cd. His voice is so great but the songs didn't match his voice they were too slow and boring. Even if he kept the songs at a slow pace they should have had more soul to it. I suggest to everyone if they want to hear a good new artist to purchase Teedra Moses new cd.
1,u call this music??????????????? WTF?,"please, 'legend'? who thought of this lame idea? cause he tinkers on the keyboard? cause kenye 'laced' the track.... people are buying into this GARBAGE 'cause that's what the idiot box (and radio) tells them to... period end of story... the new generation of music buyers have never experienced good music that they them selves had to seek out and cherish... JAY Z (ALL OF ROC-a-FELer) ..... honestly ...i have to struggle real hard to find anything current that is actually a good album.. seriously... it's a HORRIBLE SHAME what music has become.. loose your PRO TOOLS and get some tape in the studio for one.. your sound will have some integrity. NO STARS!"
1,LAME LAME PLEASE NO MORE,"I think this is a waste of money and music what are the producer doing these days and the radio plays the song like it is a hit I wonder is the radio station getting ""PAID"" to play another weak and lame song. And I heard a interview with john legend and he is talking about doing acting and I'am like why is he going to mess up a movie like that. I wonder what is a real producer these days and where is the music because this is a perfect reason why the industry is all sold out with some lame hook or song. This was the gayest CD I ever heard I do not recommend only body to buy this crap. You will be sorry."
1,immoral singer,"If you like cheating on your wife, or in John's case, have sex with more than one woman, and if you like getting ""high"", i.e., letting something other than you take control, then you will like this CD. Get Lifted is cheap sensual music, and as the overview on Amazon reads, he does not have a voice that stands out as unique. For me, he is too bland."
4,john legend,"the last time i got this excited about a new artist was hearing norah jones for the first time while sitting in barnes and nobles...maybe even more excited this time around.this guy is SO talented. what a fresh new sound, r&b; w/jazz w/classic w/gospel- & his voice is amazing...understatedly talented in such a casual manner. i love it!the only thing sad is that it took until his grammy nomination to find out about him. i hope he'll take home the grammy's this year!"
5,Nice!!!,"Yeah, this is a great cd. By the way its not an explicit cd. My favorite songs are ""Number One"" and ""Used to Love U."" But that one person was right: John Legend does have VERY good potential of being a Stevie Wonder or another good pianst. But this is a good cd and I recommend it. I hope he keeps selling cds, cause at this rate, he has good potential."
3,Not Bad But Could Of Been Better,"John Legend is cool but I think he's kind of hyped up a little, maybe because of the lack of R&B talent out now. I respect John Legend and what he does but his debut was nothing ground breaking. I did like his debut single and I thought that underperformed. When his second single came out, I liked that because the song had a different approach then your normal R&B songs. After awhile though the song got boring. The rest of the songs are nice but I dont hear anything that makes you go ""WOW"", this song is amazing. His debut is decent with a few Kanye West produced tracks and the rest similar to his second single. John Legend is talented but he needs to venture out a little more with his music because everything has the same sound."
5,Simply the Best I love him..,I love John Legend Im a huge fan. I love this album. If you dont have it. You gotta go get it. This is what real music should sound like. I got the chance to see him perform live at the Apollo Theather in New York City. Wowwwwwwww best concert Ive been to to date. His music his voice has so much energy. I LOVE HIM now and Ill love him for years to come and support his music Forever. I hope one day I can meet him and tell him how great his music and voice is. To the haters out there who say my man cant sing? Just explain why this man is Platinum and nominated for 8 grammys? Haters fall back and stop hating!
5,I Will Playing this CD for Years to Come,"Upon hearing this cd, the first thing that pop into my head was..""I want John Legend to sing 'So High' to me!!!"" One of those CD's that you can just let play, without skipping, and let it repeat. Doesn't get old. I can see myself 10 years from now poppin in that CD saying ""Oh, that's my jam"". That's saying a lot because I dont really listen to slow music but his CD is just so mellow and calming...well, hey...GO BUY IT!"
3,get lifted john ledgend,"i had bought for a friend ,she like it, ,does not play it much,not what she really expected to be"
5,John is a Legend,"When I first heard John Legend sing the ""Ordinary People"" song, I had many questions in need of answers. I thought...where is he going with this? Where's the beat, the rhythm, the soulful sound like those before him? Is he a folk singer? Who is this guy? Then he wrote, produced and performed many other songs, and I began to get into the groove of his sultry, laid-back, smooth sound, and I thought...this guy is good. Then, when I heard the song, ""So High"", man...I was hooked! So now I know John is and will always be...a Legend."
1,sorry fans!,"i am so sorry to say this, and i know a lot of u guys are gonna rate my review unhelpful, but i was REALLY dissapointed in this cd. i think i expected a lot more since kayne was constantly hyping him up. don't get me wrong, he does have a beautiful soothing voice, the i thought the content was a little weak. i think his lyrics is his biggest downfall. (sorry! just stating my opinion) i can tell by the reviews a lot of people don't agree with me. i bought this cd when it first came out for regular price, i originally bought it strictly for the track ""ordinary people"" then i took a listen to the rest of the cd, and i must say i was very disspointed. a few months later this same cd went on sale for $9.99 and i can't even say that i would pay that price.for a good listen i think you should invest in anthony hamilton or dwele. thanks guys!!! don't hate me"
5,Love It!,"I have been wanting this CD since I first heard ""Used To Love You"", then I definitely knew I had to get it when I heard ""Ordinary People"" on the radio. John Legend has a gift that you don't hear in many artists nowadays. This is a must have. My Favorites: ""Used To Love You"", ""I Can Change"", ""Ordinary People"", ""Stay With You"""
2,just aight,"John Legend has talent,but nothing here really moves me. Musically He is a Poor Man Mario Winans or Tony Rich. Kayne West is a Poor Man's Puffy basically.a couple of tracks are decent,but on a whole nothing about this set meets even half the hype it has gotten."
1,I'm so late getting this CD and I still got ripped off!,"I wished I read the reviews before I bought this album at Wal-Mart this weekend! The only good songs are So High and Ordinary People. A lot of the songs are about cheating, etc, I wish I could return!!!!"
5,Excellent Study,"This is another excellent study of the uniforms and equipment of the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. My only gripe with the text, though it is trivial, is the lack of color photos. Highly recommended!!!"
3,Not Bad,"its an interesting movie. I always think Javed Jaffery is an excellent actor and hes wasted in useless roles. This movie is good for relaxing, its a combination of comedy mystery and suspense. I enjoyed this movie, Anupam and Om puri ,this friendly couple is excellent. I think both acted very well. This movie is about a robbery of Diamonds. Truthfully i have not seen the original one. So i cant say which one is better.I wasn't expecting something excellent ,so when u watch this movie don't expect too much and you would surely enjoy it.Although songs doesn't fit the situations, even then its not bad. In short i enjoyed this movie, and i would recommend it to all light comedy movie lovers. You wont regret."
5,positively glorious,"I don't know what planet the other reviewer lives on, but this recording is by far the finest I've every heard. Peter Schreier is at his usual impeccable best: dramatic, atuned to both lyric and music and Lott matches him well, except for some occasional intonation problems. I've heard a lot of Wolf songs, and in most cases, got bored in the middle. This recording showed me that it's not the songs that put me to sleep, it's the way they are usually sung. I couldn't stop listening to this one. Few artists in our time come anywhere near close to the level of artistry of Peter Schreier and frankly, I've never heard him do anything at all, this performance included, that wasn't artistically satisfying and basicly beyond reproach."
3,"Necessary for what it is, but one of the worst shop manuals I've used","Necessary for what it is, but one of the worst shop manuals I've used. I guess there's too much variation in the models, and there's no mention of the front drum brake. Guess it was only on the very early models, but still..."
3,Anas Nin,I look forward to Anas Nin's other work this book was very deep in thought.Short stories/poems that seem very personal and dark. She has a labyrinth of a mind that seems to hold her prisoner.
3,"""it had perfume of rich lives.heavily impregnated furniture""",The descriptions Anias Nin uses are extremely detailed and the stories seem to be more focused on the descriptions than an actual plot. there is obviously symbolism being used to express a message through these descriptions. Almost like another subliminal story going on at the same time. The descriptions seem as if they are being used to subconsciously control the reader's emotions.
1,Disapointment,"After reading all of the early journals of Anais Nin, I was very disapointed in her fiction. Her writing is thin and relies on constant metaphysical emotion to create any sense of depth. Her early journals are exceptional, possibly the best diaries ever published, however, her fiction is consistently slow, often painfully dull, and self-absorbed. In comparison to her contemporaries she is almost unreadable. Hers are among the very few books thatI have ever not finished."
3,Enchanting,"I have not read this particular book yet, however I have read little birds, and delta of venus. Originally I was shocked, and now, I feel more open, alive,and worldly. I know thats alot for two little books, but Im glad that I read them."
4,Good story; strong relationship building in a category romance,"Quick and dirty: Beth's a widow with two teenage kids. Her friends buy her a night on the town with millionaire bachelor Todd. She abandons him on their initial date auction date, for which his assistant had booked a super trendy restaurant (per his norm). He is flabbergasted...and a little intrigued. He gets her to agree to another date, and he actually plans this one himself. Note: His assistant gives him the side-eye because he NEVER plans these things!They're an older couple - he's in his early 40s; she's in her late 30s, if memory serves me correctly. After their date, Todd starts hanging out with Beth and her family.This is a sweet romance (but there ARE open-door/intimate scenes) and has realistic relationship development when compared to most of these category romances."
5,It's Really Good!,Beth is a completely believable character and it's a fantasy to see her Prince Charming fall in love with her. It's well worth the read!
5,"""The Perfect Cake"" is a perfect book.","Unlike many cook books that are simply collections of recipes and a few photos of what the finished product should look like, Purdy's ""The Perfect Cake"" goes further. It is a ""why"" book, explaining how the different ingredients interact as you mix them then bake them. It also discusses the different qualities those ingredients have and offers advice on what you should choose and why. And perhaps more importantly, why not.The book also gave me the confidence to experiment with some of the basic recipes. And I didn't mind eating the results, thank you very much.I borrowed a copy of the book from my local library, learned a lot, and enjoyed it so much that as soon as I submit this review I will buy my own copy."
5,Wow! This book rules...,The recipes in this book are just plain yummy! Simply delicious cakes that are not too hard to make. Try the chocolate buttermilk cake--it is DIVINE! Mmmmm...so good:)
2,Not what it says it is,"It says the joint is stainless steel and the wrap is Irish linen here. On the maker's website, it says the joint is aluminum and the wrap is pro nylon. Amazon does this way too much. Stick with buying things they don't have to describe very much like books. That's my advice."
4,This book captures the heart and soul of the city,"This is one of the best short story collections I have read in a long time. Sharp, clear writing leads the reader into the heart of NY. A few misses, but more hits. The best stories seem to come at the end of the book, so if you don't like the first few -- keep reading. While all the stories are about or set in NY -- they offer up details of modern life that can be applied to any city anywhere. My only complaint is they haven't published a second volume."
1,Bad Description,This product does not include a full solution manual. only the appedix of the book which features selected solutions. I sent it back since i already owned a newer edition.
5,Clear and Understandable!!,Why can't all college textbooks be like this book? Many times authors write over your head to make themselves feel superior or to ensure they will still have a job explaining things to the student. Not this book. It is extreamly clear and highly understandable. I actually read the book to understand the professor instead of the usual practice of listening to the instructor to understand the book. Mary Boas did an awesome job with this book. I am more than pleased with it. It just because the number 1 book for me to recommend and you will darn sure find it in my office from now on!!
5,"A ""pocket"" reference that even Math students secretly use","Hey, Math undergrads! Home for the summer? Only room in that case for one math text? Make it Boas. She'll get you up to speed on all the mechanics of doing math; calculus, vectors, PDEs, fourier analysis and stuff. Once you have that all down pat you can go and read Spivak or whatever you like and do it properly with all those annoying little proofs ;)"
2,......,"the solutions are few and far between and the one's that are answered are meager in content. A solutions manual IS just that...a SOLUTIONS manual. I understand at this level of Mathematics most of the ""intermediate"" steps should be able to be performed by the reader but this is ridiculous."
3,This is not the best math methods book,"Boas is overrated. The book ""Mathematical methods for Physics and engineering"" by Riley, Hobson, and Bence is much better."
5,Great book for born again physicists,"Having been out of mathematics for quite some time, I purchased a few books to get me back into things for a physics class I was taking.It was my finding that Mary Boas by far had the clearest writing style, and would logically build up to advanced tricks for physicists. The book is full of problems that make you convinced of each step within a proof. I really liked that, as it makes you understand the fundamentals.In areas that she does not cover (for example, ""Variation of Parameters"") she gives excellent sources on where to find the details.I have recommended this book to several friends. I urge you to choose Boas. I had also purchased Arfken and Weber, but their writing style is not as approachable."
5,amazing!,GREAT condition! Wrapped nicely. Shipped and i recieved sooner than i expected. I was completely satisfied. the music on the cd is my new favorite cd. Not a scratch in the case. Everything was.perfect
5,This voice is amazing,"Anything by Chris young is great in my book, watched him win Nashville Star, and he has just gotten better and better! What a voice!"
2,Barry Manilow 2,"He seems caught up with hearing himself drone out songs that all sound the same. He has a great voice, but could use a song-writer."
4,great voice and country style,"Easy on the ears and an excellent stress-reliever. If you enjoy country music, check out this up and coming singer."
5,I love Chris!!!,"In my mind, Chris Young is the ultimate country singer. What more could you ask for. His voice is enough to make your knees not only go weak, but dissolve. His song writing abilities superb. This album has everything real country fans ask for: from the fun, windows-down, drivin fast 'Small Town, Big Time' to the make you bawl your eyes out deep stuff in 'Flowers' to the make you pee your pants laughin 'I'm Headed your Way, Jose'. But 'Center of My World' and 'Drinkin Me Lonely' are my absolute favorites. I can't wait till Chris releases an album again."
5,Great! From beginning to end...,It's not often that I get a new CD and like every single track on it. I think the last time I felt that way was when I got John Mayer's Room for Squares CD. There was never any doubt during the competition that Chris Young had to go all the way and take the top prize. This album is just further confirmation that they truly picked a winner.
5,HD is phat as hell !!!!!,I have heard the CD and have seen the band perform live. They are unstoppable. Every track is heavy and brutal. Keep an eye out for these guys and pick up their CD.
3,Brutal and Heavy Debut CD,"This is a decent cd for a first album. Once H.D. gets some experience under their belts, they will grow as musicians as well. If you like Pantera, old Metallica, old Megadeth, and other heavy type bands, you will take in Human Disorder.What keeps this from being a really good cd, is that it lacks some catchy riffs in most of the songs. That will come with time. This will be a cd that you do not regret in taking a chance on."
1,Cuidado,"Esto es un robo. EL que ha puesto aquí esto s un ladrón. No hay nada detras. Además le ha dado el título de un libro bastante exitoso para engañar.Voy a intentar recuperar mi dinero en Amazon y denunciar a esta persona. Te cobra 5,45$ por cuatro estupidas lineas sobre perfumes para hombres. Que nada tienen que ver ocn el titulo. En fin u robo."
2,Bait and switch,"I live in the UK, broke my T42p two months ago. I mananged to find a ""T42"" replacement, got it sent to a friend in Pittsburg who flew over last weekend and brought it to me. I managed to switch the hard drive and recover all my data. However, J&R sent my friend (and I'm typing on) a T40p. Less resolution, less everything. It's too much of a problem to send it back/get it replaced/etc., but I wouldn't trust them to send you what they advertise. I'm fortunate that my T42 hard drive worked on a T40, and that data recovery was the whole point of the purchase. O/w I'd be really pissed."
3,Average at best,"This book fails in many areas: there is no real plot to speak of, and the characters are terribly under-developed. The story meanders, diary-style, without focus. The narrator and her three friends lack personality: you simply can't tell them apart, and nothing really changes within any of them through the course of the story. The one redeeming quality of this book was its in-depth, native view of modern Chinese culture in comparison to Western culture. The author's personal experience as a Chinese-American makes for a lot of interesting commentary in her novel. I would recommend this book to others not so much for the story, but for the chance to experience modern China."
3,A Christian perspective without the rhetoric,"This book is great for those who want a modern rational for Christianity. Mr. Hall makes the belief in Jesus the Christ understandable, if not quite, well, believable. For those who are not Christian, and want a view of Christianity without the preaching or ""hell and damnation"" rhetoric, this is good. For those who are Christian, this book can provide a different view of the religion."
5,A great end to a great series,"This series wasn't as good as either the Born In trilogy or the Maryland Eastern Shore trilogy, but it was great in its own right. (Which tells you just how wonderful the other trilogies are as well.)I loved this book because it really developed not just the romance between Laura and Michael but also the family. Over the course of the novels, we've seen Laura face adultery, divorce, and the heartbreak of her children. In this novel, Ms. Roberts brings it all together and shows not only Laura learning to love again, but Michael forging father/daughter relationships with Laura's children.Wonderful, Ms. Roberts. Simply marvelous. I can hardly wait for the next trilogy (which I hear will return us to Ireland!). No one does trilogies -- especially about families -- like Nora Roberts."
4,A very satisfying end to the trilogy,Fast paced and enjoyable. Hard to put down. I would love to read additional books with these characters. Fun read
3,Sloppy writing,"This book, like all of Nora Roberts' books, is very enjoyable. The characters were interesting, and the relationship of Michael with Laura's daughters was really lovely. However, the writing in this book was kinda sloppy. In ""Daring to Dream"", everyone was surprised when Margo and Josh fell in love. In this book, everyone seems to have known it was going to happen. There was no explanation for how they found coins on the cliffs when the treasure was hidden in a cave. Michael has two horses named Lulu. Michael was told twice that Byron and Kate were expecting. Maybe these are picky points, but it gets confusing following the plot when there are inconsistencies in the details. I think the ""Born In"" series and the Cordina books were much better written."
5,dream triology,very good and keeping you interested in how it all will turn out in the end. Enjoyed it very much. Alleycatnj
2,"Entertaining, but this is not great literature","The three books that comprise this trilogy are fun and interesting reads. (I cannot understand how other reviewers can give these books 5 out of 5 stars. What in the world would they rate really good literature? And WHY do they feel compelled to tell the entire plot?) I got a little tired of hearing about the selfless sacrifices of these three women by the end of the last book. Let's face it, when they come from one of the wealthiest families in the country, how sorry can we feel for them if they have to sell their clothes or work two part-time jobs in order to pay the house staff? But all in all, enjoyable books and likeable characters. Unless you have a lot of free time, I would suggest checking out the audio versions from your local library. These are good books to listen to while commuting, cleaning house, etc., because there are few characters and the plots are very simple to follow."
2,oops,"i have a love hate relationship with Nora Roberts I always seem to adore her trilogys but some of them are sort of predictable by the third one. This one was good the first book and went downhill with the next two. I orderedn this one by accident, thinking it was the 3rd bed and breakfast one. I think it depends on the charaacters and how engaged I was with them. on a scale of one to ten the top triolgys being the Irish and Cheasapeake ones getting a ten and the bed an breakfast heading that way I'd give this trilogy a two,"
3,That's it?,"As always, Nora crafts some of the best dialogue between her characters. It's always witty and refreshing. However, this was not quite the conclusion I was expecting.I really thought Laura would break out of her mold a bit more, especially in her conversations with her ex-husband. She almost seemed (dare I say it?) wimpy in her dealings with him, particularly the scene at the dance with Candy. And why did Candy never get her ""just desserts?"" She was such a venomous character, I thought for sure she'd be taken down a peg or two more from her last ""locker stuffing.""Overall, a predictable conclusion, based on hints given in the other two stories. A bit of closure for the whole trilogy would have been great. I know Nora's not big on epilogues, but I would have appreciated one this time."
4,Finding the dream,The trilogy is great... This is the only 4... It's a great book but not quite as good as the first two in the trilogy...
2,An old book with a new cover!,After reading the first two in quick succession I could not read the third one. Just too predictable. I thought it was a new series like the bride quartet or the inn trilogy but I realized later that it was an old series with new covers.
5,An Entertaining Accountant Character,She's an accountant character but very lovable. I enjoyed the inner termoil and the drive - different kind of rescue from a dragon. Nora always writes an excellent happy-ending love story. Not for kids but character is ethical.
3,The trilogy pattern,"I buy books in series to extend the story line, but really am disappointed when nothing significant changes in the three books. Roberts is a great author and I like most of her books but as with many the later books in series tend to get a bit repetitive. This series started well, but got a little bland as it continued into books 2 and 3."
4,It's Nora Roberts,"It only took me one day to read. This last book of the series has a few great twists and turns, that make you wish you could crawl into the characters time and place. She does no less than put to rest her saga in a wonderful happy ever type ending."
3,Great Jacket...,Black Womens US Navy Type PeacoatThis was a great jacket but I purchased the wrong size.
3,Quality,The coat was ok for the price but a few of the buttons have already come loose. One of the buttons was about to fall off.
3,Not bad,Mine is a bit large for me.It's hard to size them.I'd advise you purchase a size larger that a normal jacket.
2,They get you in the shipping.,"I ordered this pea coat. I wear a size 44 jacket. This peacoat purported to be a size 44, but when I put it on I looked like a little kid in my dad's coat. Returning it was no problem, just e-mailed the company, they sent me a code, and I mailed it back. Unfortunately, they do not cover shipping in their return policy. So now I'm out $18 for shipping both ways, and I still don't have a coat. Given they don't know how to size their coats, I'm unwilling to keep trying if it's going to cost me $18 each time."
2,Peacoat review,"I purchased this coat for my son. I measured him as was indicated for proper fit. However, when the jacket arrived the sleeves were too long, the shoulders drooped, and the overall fit was too large. After trying it on only twice, we noticed that the wool around the collar was balling up which made it look old and frumpy. Also, the weight of the jacket was too heavy and bulky for regular use. I contacted the company via e-mail and was informed that the return would be at my expense (which was over $13.00) and I was to be charged a 15% restocking fee. Needless to say, I will never do business with this company again."
4,"Lots of Compliments, No Problems","I got exactly what I was expecting (hoping for). This is the original Navy, quality, pea coat. It's not a knock-off. For the price, it was a steal. It fits great and we didn't need an exchange. I'm very happy with the purchase. We even get lots of compliments!"
1,GREASY AND SMELLY,"Not too thrilled with this peacoat at all. It arrived and smelled funny,and had what can only be described as an oil sheen. All the cleaning in the world (yes, it went to the dry cleaners, and even they were unable to remove the sheen or oil smell) has not helped. And then I was told I could not return because I dry cleaned it.I got tired of this, and gave it to Goodwill. Hopefully someone won't mind the smell and sheen, and get some warmth from it. I do know that I will never trust this seller or brand again, period."
2,Not pleased!!!!!,"This is the second coat I ordered from Amazon. The first one was a Christmas gift, which I paid for the shipping (was to be free) I didnt recieve the coast unitl January, they sent the wrong size. The second coat I ordered from another vendor, this coat, the person has been wearing it for 3 weeks and has lost 2 buttons already he tells me they all keep falling off. He had the ones he had put back on but 2 are gone!"
3,"Good, but could be much better...","While I do like some of what Bostridge does, his recorded performances to me seem to be filled more and more with musical gimmicks. His tone I find refreshing from so many English tenors who sound like they are in pain while singing, but Brostridge truly does lack a good legato line and he often uses a horrible strident quality for emphisis of text.Peter Pears' recordings of many of these songs are still in many ways the difinitive performances, but I do like to hear other voices sing this repertoire and unfortunately very few options are out there. So, kudos to Bostridge for recording these songs, but lets not crown him THE new Britten singer of our time."
1,My Son a Hanuman Fan Hated This One,My son is a Hanuman fan and I got this based on the original Hanuman DVD. This one is some sort of a meld of modern and traditional Hanuman. The story line is bizzare. My son did not like it at all after he watched it. I watched parts of it and thought it was very poorly done.
4,"Great voice, suited to some of the songs, not all.","Hazlewood's voice is like raw silk- he's aged well. The CD is nice, if a bit one-dimensional. Great for relaxing with a sexy partner and a glass of wine. It would be fun to hear him do some of his own material next time. Just because he's gotten a bit older doesn't mean he needs to be quite so mellow."
3,An Anomaly in the Canon of a Great Maverick,"Far be it from me to deny the great Lee Hazlewood the opportunity to sing some torchlight jazz numbers by rote. I'm absolutely sure he had a ball doing it, and respects the iconic reputation of those jazz selections. I will defend his right to release this, but unfortunately, this is a far cry from the dryly humorous and intelligent soft psychedelia that he served up in the late 60s and early 70s. It's about as non-essential as it comes for this wonderful artist.He founded his cult status on those great Reprise, LHI and MGM recordings however this sounds more like filler than killer.Nothing can threaten the admiration I have for LH , not even this, but beware, his legacy cannot be judged by this effort."
2,essential compilation series,"essential compilation series, i think about 42 editions, but if they leave out the many fillers they've should have done it with 20. This series contains many 80's groove killer 12"" tracks that can only be found on Star Funk part 1 until 42; and the good thing is: from the mastertapes!!. Unlike many record companies making 80's groove compilations with vinyl transfers, Unidisc uses the mastertapes."
1,Disappointed,"This pamphlet provides a very good high-level overview of the WBS concept, but the sparse content does justify the $25.00 price tag. There are 58 half pages of text in this publication and it is a mere 1/4"" thick. I was very disappointed when I opened the shipping box. Before opening the shrinkwrap I surmised that I had received a CD version, but was surprised to find a very thin, very spartan publication. The content, sans the intro, about the author, and index, would probably equal to ten back-to-back pages of information. This publication clearly did not meet my expectations."
1,Dora Explorer Pinanta,I recently ordered this pinanta from Amazon/party America. Unfortunely when it arrived it wasn't this pinanta at all. It was the standing Dora. When I called I was informed that Amazon made the mistake with the wrong picture. The price I paid of course was $19.99....plus shipping and tax for a total of $28.56. You can get the same pinanta (the standing Dora)from Amazon/ Unique Industries for $10.46. GO WITH THEM and save yourself some money!!!
1,MAD,"I recentely ordered the Dora Star Catcher Pinata off of the Amazon website and made from Party America. When I received the pinata, it was the standing Dora... NOT the sitting Dora that I had wanted. I called Party America and told them the situation. They said I would need to contact Amazon because the item I had received matched the one on their (Party America) website. After contacting Amazon, I was told that I would need to contact the seller but what they could do is give feedback to the catalog department. Why would I contact the seller when Amazon is the one with the wrong photo on the website. Not to mention, I ordered 50.00 worth of pinata fillers and I can't even get 1/4 of the bag in the backpack of the pinata. I will never order anything from Amazon due to the lack of customer service and I'm not taking a chance on ordering something that isn't the right photo on the website."
4,"A lurid, comic tale of 1930's Spain.","~It's probably not a classic for the ages, but I was still fairly entertained by this strange, rambling, wickedly funny revenge tale set during the Spanish Civil War. The simple, episodic plot (man kills his brother's murderer) is really just an excuse f~ in the grotesque. And it isn't as impressive as the other Cela novels I've read (""The Hive"" & ""The Family of Pascual Duarte""), but it's still a good opportunity for general readers to acquaint themselves with this delightfully eccentric--and st"
3,Not so great.,"I can't believe the 5 star reviews this video got. On a lot of topics, I have found better information on youtube. On Some things the info is good like hydraulic brakes maintenance but overall this video was almost a complete disappointment. Most topics are not explained completely. Spend your money on a good book instead. If you are a true novice then you will enjoy the initial insight into things but if you have any experience with bikes you may be upset you spent money on this as I was. 3 stars because I did learn something."
3,Interesting & Honest Account of a Vietnam War Battle,"You cannot but praise this author for his honesty. The book tells the story of a joint USMC and US Army battle in the DMZ with brutal truth. The story is told, warts and all, and it made this book what it is.I must say however that at times I felt the story got a bit disjointed and could have used more and better maps to assist the narrative but overall the author presents a decent and well researched account of this terrible battle.If you like down to earth and in your face combat accounts then you should enjoy this book."
2,NOT THE ORIGINAL!!!,"This is not Moroder's original rendition of ""The Chase"", from the movie ""Midnight Express"", or more commonly known as the theme from radio host Art Bell's ""Coast to Coast AM"". These are really silly techno-trance-deephouse remixes and would actually sound kinda cool at a club or rave, but are nothing like the original."
3,"Cut to ""The Chase"" please","Ok, if you're into remixes you might like this, but I have one significant problem: the Original track isn't here! If the original is what started things, include it! Otherwise, the remixes are just 'nice' at best, and the fact that the classy original is not here is unacceptable."
1,Bought it thinking that the author views it one way but....,The author believes that other versions are as sutiable as the King James. s It is admitted that a lesbian sympathizer sat on the literary (stylistic) committee of the NIV.
5,A good summary of what's wrong with KJ Onlyism,"Ankerberg & Weldon provide an easy to read summary of what's wrong with KJ Onlyism. Unlike most works I have read on the topic, Ankerberg & Weldon do not start with a preconceived thesis. They go were the facts take them. Also good is that Ankerberg & Weldon quotes from primary sources fairly without distorting them. They also write with love. Bottom Line: If the King James only issue is troubling you, this is the book to get."
2,"Good product, but VERY expensive","These patches work well, but they are way overpriced (@ 18/patch). They're tiny and do not last very long, so although they work, a fair price would be under $10."
1,Did not help appearance of my scar gets too dirty to use as directed,"I tried this product because it says the one peice lasts for the whole 3 months. It does not last and gets dirt stuck all in it rendering it unuseable. The dirt/lint does not wash off out of the gel. I woulf have to have 12 or 24 of these to get through the 3 months treatment, which would cost me a fortune. I have used other brands that have a thinner more solid ""sheet'ish"" silicone layer that washes clean after each use. It gave me 12 sheets per box that you use for a week or so then use a new one. Much more sanitary. I will stick with the other brand which worked on my last surgery scar really well."
3,Scar FX,"directions are a little confusing (i.e. one says apply directly to the scar after removing sticky backing, then later it says to 'wash' the scar FX sheet beofre applying. Kind of pricey for such a small piece (1.5"" x 3""), and I found results were little or no better than using over the counter scar gel/cream. Used on recent surgical scar on leg where 14 stitches has been removed and totally healed over. Scar Line remains very visible, but not too bumpy, which may be due to the ScarFX or surgeon's skill."
3,An Interesting CD,"I love Connie Evingson. I think she has one of the most beautiful voices of the current singers. This CD - one of her earlier CDs - has some wonderful versions of familiar songs, such as Lazy Afternoon, and some jazzed-up Broadway tunes, which don't always work. They are interesting to listen to but not always satisfying because of the instrumental back-ups and her attempt to do something new with these songs. The CD illustrates her growth and maturity as a singer when you compare this one to her latest ones. Connie Evingson should be much bigger than she is now."
4,does the job,I bought this for my daughter for her college photography class.Her instructor recommended it.She says it works fine.That's good enough for me.
2,Poor Motivation,"This book is completely inadequate in my view. I'm using this text for a graduate course in Bayesian Stat. and it is extremely frustrating. The author gives almost no theoretical motivation for why one should use the methods described in the text. For example, what makes Gibbs sampling better or worse than Metropolis-Hastings. I read the chapter on this and still had to look at a Wikipedia article to gain this basic insight. The wiki also did a better job of theoretically justifying the algorithm. I'm sorry but that is just pitiful. Try something else, even if you're a beginner."
3,"It is a good book, but not a bible of Bayesian analysis.","[1] A good introductory book, but definitely not a bible of Bayesian analysis.[2] The example-based introduction may be a try of new generation of Bayesian. Many people, especially the beginners, may like this style.[3] Some of the authors are good at programming in BUGS, R, etc, so the part of MCMC methods seems worthy to skim through.[4] The book is suitable for the undergraduate and the first year graduate level."
2,Review of Kindle Edition/Translation,"I have visited the site at least five times to purchase the kindle edition, but each time I have been discouraged by the translation to the kindle format. Whoever did the job was not professional. I have finally spent my money on another book (by a different author, though not my first preference) - a sure loss to Gelman, et. al."
3,"Great Design Firm, but an Average Book","Pentagram is one of the best design firms on planet earth, so this book is a must have for a creative professional. BUT the book lacks real inspiration - it's very dry stuff. While the volume has many pretty pictures with ""case studies"" the book doesn't really tell you a story. The work itself is very good, but you can see that in an awards annual like Graphis. You just get the feeling that they didn't have any fun putting this book together. I judge my design books on how often I run to them for inspiration - and this volume doesn't rate too high. I have an ancient book by the founders of Pentagram (Fletcher, Forbes & Gill) which blows these kids out of the water. So this book is a must have for the reference library, but you may want to wait until it's on sale."
3,I always hated that hat.,"This movie tries very hard to be good. And by god I try not to get to heavy on these films because I love them so much. But this is a mixed bag that just seems a little confused. It is almost a Musketeer/pirate cross. The fencing goes from good to terrible, and that is a big shame as Eric roberts is damned good. If anyone has seen By the sword you know what I'm talking about.The camera work goes from good to terrible. What is good about the film is that it can be watched with kids, it is very swashbuckling in nature, it has Eric Roberts and some of the characters are adoreable even though they are steryotyped. If you like swash and buckle movies give it a watch."
2,"Well, my 10-year-old loved it....","...but he found the story confusing. With some editing to make the movie a little simpler and perhaps a narrator to pull things together, they should repackage this one and pitch it to Disney. My son loved the swordplay and the goofy characters and couldn't stop laughing at them.The only fun I got out of it was watching Ron Perlman, but then, I could listen to him read the Manhattan phone directory and never be bored."
5,Great movie,"I turned on tv a few weeks back and saw a small,but brilliant movie about kings guards. I was impressed with the production..the sets and designs looked really professional and the acting was above average. I am not sure why this movie was not shown in the theatres, or I don't remember seeing it. But I highly recommend it for family viewing"
3,More like a TV show for kids.,This movie is More like a TV show for kids. Adult won't like it much. The fighting scenes are slow and look like drills for beginners. The small budget is obvious in many scenes where there are only some actors and actresses without any horses. It's beautiful filmed. The costumes look authentic and attractive.It's still an enjoyable family movie.
4,cute period movie,"this movie,although it is lacking in sets and background, it's story is sweet about a member of the king's guard who secretly loves princess gwendolen who is on her way to be married to a king to save her father's throne.it's cute and nice to watch.a very rare movie and i was suprised amazon had this and especially on dvd!i am glad i got 1 of the last 2 they had in stock.i never thought i'd see this movie again."
4,good emo/indie rock,this a good cd. i like track #2 the best. it reminds me of that posies songs from the hype documentary.i like the dual vocals alot adds a kick to the album
5,Bliss Pop,"This Snappy Droopy pop jewel befriends, entrances and weaves memes with lush airy chick slash upfront geek guy vocals, jangle treble slash distorto angular guitar and that phonographic sound I love.Nothing left to say."
5,Great singing,Every year I purchase several christmas cds. This was one of my favorite. As a singer in a male chorus I enjoy the sound of MEN singing. I also purchased the recording to hear the Pinkham Christmas Cantata which we(Golden Gate Men's Chorus) sang on our holiday program. It is a great piece performed with a brass ensemble. I know the director from his Chanticleer days. If you are looking for a very good holiday cd this is one to buy.
5,Self-Tan remover,I'm very fair skinned and I have tried multiple products for self-tan. This is the best tan remover on the market. The only negative is it stinks as it is bleach and it is very abrasive. If you have sensitive skin you have to be careful.
4,Raw,"This band was introduced to me back when I was in high school. You can compare the music to be somewhere a cross between L7 and Bikini Kill. With the heavy guitar sounds and grinding vocals, the singer exlplores cliches and politics, with a voice range between the singers from Bikini Kill and Naked Aggression. Its raw and loveable."
1,Based on a flawed worldview,"I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact."
4,"Sensible, actionable approach to motivating others.","Practical and useful for developing relationships, not just with those you manage but with all relationships including family. It points out what we all know works for US but what's not so easy to offer others: positive, immediate and certain reinforcement for behaviors we want to encourage."
4,It's the consequences!,"Aubrey Daniels is somewhat of an expert on Performance Management. I work for a company where his principles are practiced on a daily basis. Behavior is a function of consequences and it can be adjusted by applying the proper form of reinforcement. The art of performance management, as presented by Daniels, is a scientific procedure based on an individuals behavior. The bottom line is when you are needing to get results from others you have to go for what works. Through the examples and lessons taught in this book you will have a good start in understanding the PM principles. This book is a great read for anyone wanting to take others to new heights of performance."
1,Big let down,"I bought this concert on Laser disc several years ago and was blown away by the music and excellent production. Unfortunately, when I saw that it was available on DVD I rushed to buy it but it's a big let down. The disc is NOT good. Poor quality and poor sound. I looks like it was struck from an old VHS copy or worse. I can't tell if this is a new edition since I gave my DVD away and have no way of comparing the distributor. But I think this is the same version I bought."
2,"Good effort, but . . . . .","Too much emphasis on outdated technology and not enough on what you see in the real world. Also, the writing was a bit stilted and it could have been better organized."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"I followed one of the so-called ""tips"" to the letter and wound up having to call technical support to fix the problem. Whoever wrote this should TRY their suggestions before they put them in a book."
4,Entertaining Little Film,"Low budget flick about a gang of escaped prisoners lead by a serial killing veitnam vet terrorizing a vacationing average American family. I didn't expect much from this film having pulled it from the used bargain bin at a video store, but I found it thoroughly entertaining and well executed for the budget they had to work with, with just enough bad acting, dialog, and scene moments to satisfy the cheesy movie lover in me as well, thumbs up."
3,Fear,This movie is so over the top that it is actually quite entertaining. The psychotic vietnam vet is so overdone that it takes on a comical flair; with the exception of killings in the food store. Watch for the peak comic moment when the vet tells everyone to get in the van after shooting Frank Stallone's character -
4,Nice educational toy,"This is educational and fun. I ordered two, and both of my newphews like them. Minor problem: one arrived with very weak batteries which died within two minutes of operation. The other arrived with dead batteries."
4,"Learn to Calculate Money, but the Sound Can Get To You","My 6 year old uses this to count up his money in his piggybank. So, for that this thing is great. As for my 2 year old, she just keeps pressing the buttons that can really get to you. There is a switch to shut off the sound, but she knows how to turn it on.Otherwise, a nice little gadget. It is missing a $20 bill button, but how many kids actually have a $20 in their piggybank."
5,Buchanan is always a good read.,"Kept me on my toes, consistent writing style. I hope she continues the sage of Britt Montero, she has created a character worth reading."
2,"Some Good, Some Bad, Some Evil","The small stories at the beginning of this book were the best part. In the main story line, the killer's character was well developed and believable but Britt as a hostage just did not ring true. Although Britt admits, at the end of the book, that her actions were foolish and irresponsible, it left me wondering how such a smart and savvy woman wouldn't have figured this out in the beginning. The ending came as no big surprise. This was a fairly interesting character study, but as a mystery it was sadly lacking"
2,Extreme disappointment after reading this one.,"As an Edna Buchanan and Britt Montero fan I was filled with immense disappointment after reading this one. ""Garden of Evil"" required more suspension of disbelief than I am capable of. And, Britt's photographer friend at ""The News"" has become one very annoying character. James Lee Burke and Clive Cussler have proven that a continuing character can get stale and become a parody of itself. It may be time for Edna Buchanan to give Britt a rest and during the pause give us a new protagonist. Then Britt can return refreshed, much like James Robicheaux and Dirk Pitt have after interludes by their authors. Michale Connelly has broken up his Harry Bosch series three times, and that certainly looks like the right way to keep a character vibrant. Edna Buchanan has given us much much better about Miami (and Britt) and is capable of so much more. This is not up to the usual high Buchanan standard."
4,Welcome back!,"At first I found this particular Britt Montero mystery a bit slow. I wasn't sure where it was going, but when it got there -- WOW! Yes, it was a bit farfetched at times, but certainly no more than the most recent Patricia Cornwell books. If anything, Montero and her cohorts are far better company than Scarpetta's clan. Buchanan's writing is consistently witty and clear, devoid of literary pretensions but never illiterate. (For illiterate, check out Gene Hackman's ""Wake of the Perdido Star"" -- but only if you must.) Anyway, a welcome addition to the catalogue."
2,Not worth the money...,"It's small and not very durable. My 8 year old wanted a small drum set to learn and play on...I got this as a Christmas present. The drum stick broke in 2 days, and the set was falling apart in a a few weeks. Not very sturdy or worth the money. I thought it would be since it's made by a reputable company."
5,startling and surprising on every page.,"This is a premiere work of historical fiction. I'll say it again: this is historical fiction at its best. The landscape leaps into being with a few well-chosen words; the characters seem to live and breathe. The prose peers into a long-lost time and evokes it in astonishing, true-to-life detail, showing how the broader sweeps of political fortunes and indeed the fates of nations stem ultimately from choices arising in the conflicted human heart. This book is breath-taking. After reading Goudge I judge all other works of historical fiction by this one, and when the imaginations of other authors disappoint, I come back to Goudge to be refreshed."
5,Just as described,Well it's a gingerbreadman cookie cutter. The depth does help doing thicker dough. And the size means the dough is easy to remove. It's easy to wash as well. The comfort grip rubber makes it easy for my daughter to use too.
2,"What's this? Not what I ordered, that's for sure.","I got this product a couple of days ago. I was really depending on the measurements listed in the product description being accurate. The ACTUAL product dimensions are: 4 x 4 x 1 inches. Compare this to the dimensions listed on Amazon.com: ""Product Dimensions: 7.3 x 5.1 x 1.7 inches ; 1.6 ounces"". Even the piece of cardboard it was wired to wasn't that big. What's the problem? Is someone is China trying to convert from 2.54cm to one inch? Is conversion too hard? Is the product packaging also too hard to measure? Well sorry, but my kid's preschool class is really going to have some small gingerbread men for our holiday party. Arg... [...]"
4,Worth a hearing if you like romantic piano concerti,"The romantic era featured many touring piano virtuosos, and Xaver Scharwenka was near the top of the class of the virtuosos in the quality of the concerti he wrote. His fourth concerto was an ambitious work, combining much of the melodic quality of his second and third concerti with the brashness of the first.Sauer is less well known (which is saying quite a bit) than Scharwenka, but has a similar flavor in his concerto. Both of these works are unusual in being laid out in four movements.The performances and recordings a well done. Well worth a listen if you like this genre."
2,Nothing extraordinary here...,"I'm a little surprised that a pianist of Stephen Hough's caliber would be interested in recording such third-rate material. There is a reason that these concertos have not survived as standards in the repertoire. The performances are pristine. Clearly a lot of work went into pulling off this recording project. But again, the material seems hardly worth the effort of all those involved."
2,Unsatisfied,"Unfortunately, after taking the product for several weeks, I have experienced no positive effects of change in mental, focus, or clarity. I'm on my 3rd week taking Futurebiotics Thinkfast and still no changed."
1,Terrible for Young Children,"In the ""Sleeping Beauty"" story, it says ""When the Princess is seventeen, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel, and then die."" I don't find this appropriate for young children and am not wishing to explain this to them when they ask!"
3,Adds little to rock's stockpile,"Throughout this decent, uncontaminated rock album, I can't help but pass on most of these songs as unimpressive, seeming to vary only in mellow to harder, slow to fast. Judging by the song titles, the lyrics and songs themselves should be far more interesting. These albums of real rock are a dying breed, and personally I can't say it's any more than bittersweet. Oh, and just to follow suit, I have heard some stuff by The Cult, however, nothing comes to mind. For forgettability, I would reduce it to two stars, but asking for a standout on a pure rock album asks the world."
3,"Huge Cult fan, not a big Barbarian fan","It's ok. If it get's it out of Ian's system and he's ready to hit it with Natural Born Guerilla then I'm ok with this cd.Don't get me wrong, the cd isn't bad, it's just not The Cult. Not even close. It does have some strong moments but nothing to go out of your way for.I hope with the new cd Ian just rock's out like we all know he can. The Witch baby!"
4,good for Cult fans,"I'm a huge Cult fan, and I bought this disc shortly after it came out. I wasn't blown away at first, but I thouroughly enjoy the album every time I listen to it. Ian sings as well as he did on the last Cult album, and the guitar and rythm is pretty strong. Any Cult fan will notice the overall disparity in quality, but still consider this a good buy. If you aren't a Cult fan, this album probably won't impress you.I look forward to brilliant new Cult material next year, and Ian's solo album (Natural Born Geurilla). I recently saw The Cult live and can tell you they haven't skipped a beat."
4,"A period piece, but a good one","This version of THE COVENANT HYMNAL stems from 1973, replacing a 1950 hymnal, and was published for the Evangelical Covenant Church, a smallish (115,000 member) Protestant denomination that is nonetheless ""Mainline"" in style and outlook (largely Arminian). The group's Swedish heritage is evident in the hymnal's nearly two dozen Scandinavian hymn tunes between its red covers as part of 630 hymns in all. Otherwise it is very similar to Mainline Protestant hymnals of the era, and there is next to nothing that wasn't picked up by the larger COVENANT HYMNAL: A WORSHIPBOOK(q.v.) that supplanted it in 1996. On grounds of general utility I'd have to give this hymnal three stars, but the volume's quality binding, Seventies affability and charming old Covenanter ""steeple"" logo make this a toothsome choice for collectors, and I'm awarding it four."
5,So Cute!,This outfit is so adorable and very well made. The jersey is thick enough so that it can't be seen through and it is very comfortable. I love it and am very pleased.
5,Sarah would have approved!,Great artistry and control. Sophisticated phrasing. A singer's singer.Amazing selection of tunes. One of those CD's you'd save first if there was a fire. Warning: George Evans can become anaddiction!
4,I really loved the quality of the movie.,The play was very good. I love plays so I purchase them Alot I was really impressed with the quality I had never brought used before so I was Kind of nervous but I was very pleased.
3,Not the greatest....,"I got to check this out on TVOne today, and to be honest I have mixed feelings on it. First of all you have these two people, Dorien Wilson, a married man, who never forgot his high school crush Peaches(Wendy Raquel Robinson)yet in this play, it's best you don't go back. For one, she's got a substance abuse problem with a drink constantly in her hand, she has a lunatic ex fiance stalking her, she has unresolved past pain that she masks with the alcohol and prescription drugs, and though Wilson was warned about this woman, he still went after her to his own detriment. Talk about the grass being greener? definitely not in this instance. I tend to agree with the folks here on this because although there was potential, even with pros here,there wasn't no hope for this. If your curious, watch it on TVOne or rent it."
2,It has it's moments!,I was truly disappointed by this movie(stage play). Now don't get me wrong it had it's moments and when a moment was good it was gooooooood. There are a few moments that are a touch confussing as well I thought it was just me at first but we were having movie night and everyone was asking what happened. It had a message true enough and I know you can't share an entire life story of the characters in 90 mins but at least I should care about them. I didn't truly care what happened to them. I just wanted it to get to the end so I didn't feel like I wasted my money. Bottom line this is not one of those movies where I will be poppin' it in the DVD player when there is nothing on TV.
3,only problem is shipping,took forever to ship to me. i wish i would've just bought it in the store bc i missed out a week of reading for class. Order in advance in order to get it on time or else just buy in the store.
2,Not a horror movie,"Let me say that this movie is not a horror flick. It is billed as that and it is far from that. It reminded me of the movie clue with everyone's secrets and in the end there is someone that are dead. This is more like a soap opera with all of the ""stories"" that people are holding. It is a very odd movie. I gave it two stars because it did have a plot and it seemed very interesting at times, but I was expecting to see a horror movie about a haunted room 207."
5,The chirpies are on this episode,"We own every Wubbzy dvd on the market and this is by far the best - and it has the episode ""Follow the leader"" which my 3 year old loves. This DVD is all about helping others and as always very cute."
1,Disappointing book.,"I found this guide to be very disappointing. Most of it (95%) repeated what was in the first book on the game. Very little coverage of the sequel game, and there was nothing mentioned that I hadn't already read elsewhere. If you already own the first book, then you're better off just looking at a couple of the better Sims web sites and saving your money."
2,Nothing new...,"If you surf the internet for stuff about The Sims, you really don't need this book. Before I got it, I had been looking for stuff on the net, and found everything I needed. The book just repeats the stuff already out there for free! Save yourself a few bucks toward the new expansion pack! Take a couple minutes and surf the net for the info."
3,So-so queer flick,"Well, I normally like French gay-themed films but this one left me wanting. At least with the benefit of English subtitles, everything is not lost, but little really is gained; I was surprised by character development that seemed out of no where (lost in translation maybe) and the couplings that happened disappointed me."
3,"Brief,but good,and easy to understand","This is more of a tract,or booklet,but it is good and will be helpful to the average reader.This tract covers 13 main passages related to the Messiah,and will adequately supply a Sunday School teacher or someone with key information to support belief in Jesus Christ being the only possible candidate for the messiah to appear in history."
4,I don't really know,I wasn't able to really get into the book. It is well written from what I could see. I will read it when I get a chance.
5,KC Lights,"Very nice product, no more rust with these stainless lights. They are very easy to install. There price was also cheaper than any other site."
5,"It's 2008, this CD is still one of my favorites","As other reviewers have said, DnB does not need to be harsh like Aphex Twin, AK1200 etc. DJ Marky performs his mixes live and the Latin infusion is so beautiful. It makes a cold day in Wisconsin feel like Brazil."
3,An amusing read,"I read this book because it's about gardening which is a hobby I love. It's about gardening neighbours. My neighbour is a keen gardener and is even my neighbour on our local allotment site. However, I felt that this was a single anecdote spread a little thinly. The chapters were all about different events in which the neighbours tried to outdo one another. It made for some amusing reading but in real life I find this is not how it happens. We give each other spare seeedlings, swap cuttings, look after each other's plants when one is on holiday. That wouldn't make for much of a book though.I wasn't impressed by Riley going into fields to collect a big rock for his garden, or by the fact that they went to a conservation area to collect toads. It's not on and we wouldn't do it. I don't like to condone in a story what I wouldn't tolerate in real life. An amusing read though, on the whole."
5,Memories of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,Those who have visited the tomb and especially those who have been present overnight there will find this recording a wonderful way to return.
1,What a lemon!,"This phone is a complete disappointment. If I don't maintain a line of sight with the base I start getting static. Close the door of the room where the base is, more static. Go around the corner into another room, I might as well be talking from Antarctica. The channel switching is totally useless. What's the point of it being cordless if I have to be within a few feet to get decent reception? I'm returning this thing as soon as possible."
3,Okay,"Bought ths because it was cheaper than replacing the battery of my older cordless. If you have the money, I recommend the UNIDEN waterproof phone."
3,Pretty good...but not great,"A phone is a phone and this phone is no different from the others. The battery does run out frequently, yet it charges quickly. The panel is a little hard to figure out and, when it came to the speaker function, I actually had to read the user guide because I kept hanging up on people. Caller ID and adjusting the volume are easy enough. It does have a headset jack on the side and it works fine with the headset I have. It's a pretty good value for the price. However, if you want a top-notch product, I would pay a little more and get something else."
1,Poor Performer,"Based on Uniden's reputation and excellent performance of a 900mhz Uniden in my house, I bought 2 of these to replace (cheap)2.4 ghz GE phones for use in a large barn. The cheap phones would cover the entire interior of the barn, with some capability outside. The Unidens, mounted on the same RJ-11 sockets, will not even work for the length of the barn. I plan to write to Uniden and express my discontent."
4,IT DOES THE JOB,"I bought this phone to use with a magicjack for my mother who is on a fixed income. It works fine, I can't tell if it's a land line or not when calling. As far as battery life, my mother hasn't complained."
4,a fine phone,"Certainly not the ultimate in technology but if you need an extra one line cordless, this is an incredible buy."
4,nice box set,"I've got all their albums and CD's, but this box set is a very nice collection. The DVD is well worth it - I think the clarity is fine, and again there is no other live footage of this band available that I'll ever see (I saw this tour actually). Nice booklet; the 125th Congress remix is just a waste of space and does nothing - why was that crap necessary?Sound is good throughout - could've boosted the bass a bit more in the mix.And the cover is just silly. 4 stars tho."
5,Good cd selections - Great DVD!,"I don't understand complaints that the cd's here contain already released material. The product description clearly says so. I for one found this collection a very nice compliment to my only other Weather Report cd ""Weather Report, the Jaco Years"". ""Forcast: Tomorrow"" contains great stuff from the pre-Jaco and post-Jaco years. The photos and notes in the accompanying book are very good.As for the DVD, it is also clearly described as a video from the Rockpalast concert of 1978, and if you already have it you are very fortunate. I had not seen it before, and I found it to be very good. The performance is excellent. The cameras switch to capture the ensemble well. The close ups are good enough to follow how each performer is executing their important solos. Jaco is at his best. This is the quartet with Peter Erskine, and the performance captured here is more complete and, to my ear, better than the ""8:30"" cd."
4,"Nice Thermometer, Great Price","Have had this item a little over a month. Has good reception range and seems to be pretty accurate, as long as you place the outdoor sensor properly. I originally had the sensor getting hit by direct sunlight, which caused it to read very high during the day. I moved it onto the porch out of the sunlight and it works much better. The only real improvement I can think of is that it would be nice if it had a backlight so you can read the display a bit easier."
2,disappointed,"Within 30 days of purchase, the remote device stopped being read by the interior device. So after spending 2 months trying to find customer service contact information on Oregon Scientific, I gave up. Too bad. I thought OS was a good product up to now."
2,Poor performance on the remote unit,"The main unit seems to work okay, however, I bought this mainly for the ability of getting the outside temperature remotely. The outside temperature on my unit usually reads eratic temperatures, and the barometer never changes. But even if these did work, I cannot get a signal about 6 feet away through one wall. I tried every thing: RESET the units, replace the batteries, move the units around. Nothing seems to work.Buy this only if you want a good bargain on an indoor digital thermometer. Other wise look elsewhere for a remote temperature system."
2,Not that good,Not as good as expected. Unable to change to metric system in the main unit. Unable to change the time to 24hr format.
4,From India to the Planet Mars,"Sonu Shamdasani's insightful preface to Fluornoy's classic study makes this book well worth rereading. The case of Hélène Smith was a hallmark in the early development of modern psychology. This is one of the first scientific studies of mediumship, making it a classic both for students of psychology and for those interested in parapsychology as well. Fluornoy's careful and measured scientific insight combined with his writing style give this work the fascination of a novel and the import of a scientific work."
1,Plays with director's commentary on,"The movie plays with director's commentary that cannot be turned off. The movie itself might be good, but with the commentary, it is unwatchable."
1,Doesn't include subtitles!,"This film, although it looks excellent, does not contain English subtitles. At least, the Amazon video-on-demand version doesn't. Supposedly the DVD does. Very frustrating to buy the download, wait for it to complete, only to find it is unwatchable."
4,Tinny and Tin Pan Alley,"I play ukulele and that's gets any album/cd an extra star.There are over twenty better and less known TPA and American Songbook tunes here so there's lots to listen to. Ms Reiner plays uke passably and the album is not over-produced. BUT her voice is awful. One reviewer of another cd of hers thought it was a parody! I can get by this because I love uke and this old material so much, but her chops might prove daunting to some who expect a polished, ready for the stage performance."
4,Kids love it,"My kids (boy 3, girl 4) want to watch this all the time. They love the travels of Sammy the soccer ball. My wife says they ask kick the ball all the time. We now have one broken lamp. It's fun. I played soccer in college...and this is a great way to get them started."
5,"sorry, i don't speak english","es necesaria cierta dosis de sensibilidad para captar el mensaje; una vez asimilado es una caricia a los sentidos; el resto es disfrute y sólo despertar al terminar el c.d.aromas eiffel o un recuerdo de miller, yo personalmente opto por dejar a salvo el romance de la distancia y no exigir a la geografía más de lo que merecemos.vale la pena buscarlo y entrar a sus sabores, paladar gracias."
5,It will totally surprise you!,"It was so much fun reading this thriller. It kept me reading from begining to end. What I like the most was the end, it is not so typical, like in most thrillers. It will surprise you. I also liked the way the author describes emotions, he's very precise. It made it more enjoyable. If you like thrillers you have to read it!"
4,"Not all 60"" are the same size","I just received the Westcott 60"" umbrella expecting it to match the Photoflex 60"" umbrella that I already own. They both seem of good quality and operate similarly but there is certainly a difference in size. I've taken a picture of both, [...]. The Wescott umbrella is on the left and noticeably smaller than the Photoflex umbrella on the right."
3,"Ok for the price, but underperforms","Westcott makes some great modifiers, but this ""convertible"" umbrella did not live up to the name. First, the size is not that much bigger than my 43"" Promaster convertible umbrella. The interior black skin does not have any reflective material, this in itself causes the umbrella to eat up about 1-1.5 stops of light when used in the bounce configuration. Overall my promaster performs much better in both bounce and shoot through. The white ""satin"" finish on the Westcott is one of the least translucent umbrellas i've seen, it loses about 2/3 stops of light more when compared to a similar 60"" umbrella.The build quality is nice so far, it's been thrown around a bit with no bent ribs."
3,"Nice and Big ... Great For Catching Wind, Too!","I really do like this umbrella... a lot!It's nice and big, provides great soft light when used a shoot-though, etc.The only complaint I have is regarding the ""spokes"" within the umbrella.On my second time using this umbrella outside, a nice gust of wind came along.After the wind did it's thing, I was left with (3) bent spokes.After the shoot, I ended up trying something to fix it.I got some ""wire type"" hangers.Cut (3) lengths. Placed the pieces on the inside of the bent spoke.Then I used duct tap to secure the piece.It looks a little bit ""ghetto"" but I am still able to use this umbrella.It's a little embarrassing when your gear does something like that,in front of a client....but I guess we are measured by how we handle situations like this.Don't let the client see ya sweat!!Enjoy!"
2,A umbrella that saw better days,"When my umbrella arrived, unfortunately it was significantly damaged and unrepairable. The spokes and slide mechanism were bent for some unknown reason. I did contact the vendor, and within a few days I was able to get a refund. I will say however that the cloth appeared to be durable and of good quality."
4,Easy classy music,"This is a great CD to listen to if you're a fan of music from the 1940s. Listening to this CD gives the effect of sitting in the parlour after dinner listening to a radio show. The fact that this selection of songs was recorded for U.S. troops abroad during WWII, gives it a nice historical touch. It has not been restored, which at first is vexing, but it sounds nice and original as though it were comming from a radio or a record player. I recommend it"
4,Good book,"This is a good book. Gives lots of useful information and includes recipes. I haven't used any of the recipes though, they all have some really random things that I just dont have in my house."
1,Friend Suggested This book to me,"A friend who was also pregnant at the time suggested this book to me. I bought the whole set. I HATE reading this book. Alot of jargon and messy layout. As I read this book it made me feel like they didn't edit it before publishing. For anyone who is pregnant I would recommend another book called "" Mayo Clinic Guide to A Healthy Pregnancy"""
3,Hmmm...,"Better search the internet for info on what to eat or not while pregnant, did not find it useful myself. Or maybe is just me!"
5,Worth the money,"I enjoyed this book very much. Has great ideas and is written to make everything understandable.Includes recipes! Havent tried any yet, but many sound very good!"
3,Not a must-have,"This was one of the first books I bought when I found out I was expecting. It is a very nice resource to have, but most if the information in it can be found by reading pregnancy sites on the internet. By the time I recieved this book in the mail I already knew most of what was in it. The main reason I bought this book was for the recipes, but I've had the book for over a month and have only used two of the recipes. A lot of them call for ingredients I don't typically keep on hand."
2,Expected More,"If you have no clue about basic nutrition, this book is for you. If you are a healthy eater and a pretty well informed person, you don't really have to get this book unless you want confirmation that you're doing all the right things."
4,A good resource,"I really liked the What to Eat when You're Expecting (an older edition of this book). This new edition has more recipes than the old book (and few, if any, repeats). I prefer the format of the old book for the nitty-gritty nutrition info."
3,Not exactly what I expected,I had been hoping for more information that I felt was really relevant here. This seemed to be more common sense than information that I really needed.
2,"Basic cookbook, not what I expected","This book is good if you have absolutely no idea about basic nutrition, and rarely cook and need some sort of recipe guide...Otherwise, it's just a recipe book. I didn't read anything in here I didn't already know, there were no real charts or guides of things to stay away from and why....I read a few pages of each chapter and then was surprised to find the bulk of the book was just recipes...I'm not sure what I was looking for, but this wasn't it. I can see how some people would find this book super useful, but if you already have a basic understanding of proper nutrition and cook meals for yourself than this is just a waste of money."
2,Only buy if you can cook for hours....,"I expected this book to talk more about nutrition than ""What to expect when you are expecting"". But it says the same thing. This book didn't suit my needs at all because it asks a pregnant woman, who can barely remember to turn the oven off when she's finished, to cook gormet meals. I was an excellent cook pre-pregnancy, and these meal plans and suggestions would have been difficult, time-consuming, and costly even then! If anyone CAN indeed cook like a gormet cheif when pregnant and has the dough to spend on it, by all means, this book is for you."
2,Great if you have all day to cook...,"This is a recipe book, and that's it. Perfect if that's what you're looking for, but if you live in the real world and eat out from time to time there really are no good tips in here. Essentially what you get is, ""cook for yourself"" or ""learn to punch your way out of a wet paper bag"" (I choose the latter for hopefully obvious reasons). Thinking for yourself isn't overrated after all!"
2,you know it anyway,Got this book by mistake. It is OK but there is nothing in it that you don't get at the ante netal classes. Would reccomend what to expect when your expecting instead.
4,Lot of Information and GUILT!,"Although this is a great text for a first pregnancy (mine), it also is quite a bit preachier than I had expected. There is something to be said for stressing the importance of healthy eating for expecting Moms to prevent birth defects, it goes a bit beyond that point to making you feel like you can choose to give into your cravings and have that Snickers bar, OR you can choose to be a good ""vessel"". I mean, come on! I have a PhD in chemistry, so I'm all for the science, but do it without the moral agenda. Other than that, I loved the way each nutritional requirement is broken down into a series of options. I personally hate milk, but the author goes to great lengths to give exhaustive lists of alternatives that meet the same nutritional requirements."
3,Nothing new...,"If you know anything about proper nutrition and excercise, this book will be a waste of money. The recipes seemed exciting, but proved to be disappointing. The measurements and yields were not accurate on the recipes I tried. However, if you are clueless about clean, healthy eating this may be the book for you!"
5,Excellent Recipes,"The recipes in the back half of the book are uniformly excellent and very appealing, especially if you're suffering from morning sickness. I've only made one that we didn't care for (mac and cheese). I've made some of the dishes for potlucks and friends, and they went over great. Even my finicky husband has enjoyed the various dishes. The recipes are full of veggies and flavor and most are fairly easy to make. I really liked the muffins and sweets. She uses fruit juice, flax seeds and whole grain flour, and they turn out great. Not too sweet. I'll be using the recipes in here long after the baby is born.I read the first part of the book, but I don't remember much of what it said. Buy it for the recipes in the back. You'll be happy you did."
5,Great reference durring pregnancy,I bought this book for my wife at her request. She has loved it and enjoyed the useful information about nutrition during pregnancy.
2,Not very modern or updated or easy to follow for that matter...,"I flipped through some of the recipes, they aren't anything I would want to eat AT ALL. There was no pictures, nothing mouth watering or motivating about the eating right."
1,FREEZES UP,I bought this as a gift for someone. The picture quality seems good but it starts to freeze after about 18-20 minutes into the movie. Tried it on 4 players and they all did the same thing. Will be returning it. I wouldn't even give it one star except your forced to so you can complete the review. If they are willing to exchange it while they take care of all shipping charges I will update review.I am updating this as of 1-28-12. I contacted the seller and they took care of it immediately. No arguments whatsoever. They told me to pitch the defective disc and they sent out a replacement. The receiver of the gift is very pleased and so am I. Good job to the seller.Here is my update. I contacted the seller and they sent me a return as fast as they could. Told me to trash the bad disc. Bravo for taking care of the problem as well and as fast as they did. They get a excellant recomendation from me.
3,"Satisfactory,not great but satisfactory.",This vendor performed the transaction in a very exemplary manner even after I complained about product quality.They sent me another copy of the DVD.I salute them.Thank you.
4,"Good movies, lousy image","This is a good movie but Cozumel Films should have tried harder to deliver a decent product. The image is so crappy you want to.... fill in the blank.Any way, the movie is ok."
2,A Battle Of The Bayport Bands,"""Wreck And Roll"" is the rather tedious tale of a battle between two up-and-coming bands from Bayport. The Hardy's pal, Phil Cohen, is dating one of the band members and the Hardys quickly get involved when someone tries to sabotage the band's efforts for stardom. There's some frenzied action and pointless violence as this tale limps along to its rather obvious conclusion."
5,"Bratz, rock !","When i saw this Rock Angelz Sasha doll, i was in shock. Her gorgeous green eyes are stunning and the blonde/golden hair is fabulous! Sasha's make up is beautiful. I love the entire theme of these Bratz dolls; the Rock theme. This collection of Bratz dolls, in particular, gives a great message to, mostly young girls : Girls CAN rock! The accessories and clothes are well detailed and realistic; almost as if they have shrunk real clothes and put them on a doll! Such an absolutly wonderful collection for Bratz; What a lovely doll! I recomend all the wonderful Bratz Rock Angelz dolls, but Sasha in particular!"
3,An ok Sasha.,"This Sasha is cute.I like her clothes.She is not the best one in the rock angelz collection,but stills fine.Do you noticed that MGA made Roxxi doll alone like Yasmin,Cloe,Jade,and Sasha.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
2,UGLY AND DUMB DOLL!!!!,"People, do NOT get this doll, she is ugly and dumb! Like as if any girl would ever become a famous rock star! Becoming an extra in a movie (my scene) with Lindsay Lohan (who by the way is a REAL person!) is WAYYYY more true to life! This doll is so not pretty and her feet come off! How stupid is that?!?! Don't get this doll, get an actually pretty, NOT AT ALL trashy doll, like My Scene!!!Buh-BYE."
1,interesting piece of revisionist history,"Let's see...for starters Lincoln didn't free a single slave in the US and slavery existed in the US after the War of Northern Aggression and his execution.Lincoln wrote, ""If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it"""
1,Worshipping Father Abraham,"Just what the world does not need: another enormous book written about one Lincoln speech (or order or whatever). When will this Lincoln idolatry end? We already have built shrines and temples to this man. Should we worship him the way the Romans worshipped their emperors?He did not die for our sins. He did not rise from the dead. He will not answer our prayers. He did bring about emancipation, but under the worst possible circumstances. One hundred years of awful race relations were the result. Perhaps just one year with no new Lincoln books, or at least no books looking at one document."
2,So many books; rehased emotion.,"Lincoln was a traitor to the true form of Republican Democracy. Today he would be known as a war criminal. The Emancipation Proclamation was a effort to cause more misfortune to the south. It is unfortunate today that Lincoln is known as the great statesman that freed the slaves through his Emancipation Proclamation speech. He was a known segregationalist and stated that the two races equally free can not and will not live under the same form of a so-called representative government. He is widely known for his belief that extraditing the negroes back to Africa or the Caribbean was an agenda he would implement. The million dollar question is was he saying these things to garner votes, being the politician he was- or was he stating something he really felt in his soul and wished to act upon! The Emancipation proclamation should be visited with the same caution."
5,"Awe-inspiring, creative guitar playing","Jim Campilongo is a God on guitar.It's not just that he's technically good, but it's that he plays with so much creativity, humor and intensity.The 10 Gallon Cats support him superbly, rocking out when they need to but laying low on the quieter tunes. And once again, Joe Goldmark is fabulous on pedal steel.This CD is a little more rockin' than the band's previous releases, and it makes for a more varied approach.Incredible."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I bought this CD on speculation. It was suggested by Amazon based on some of my previous purchases. I am an avid blues hound and enjoy jazz very much as well, this CD is neither. I was hoping for some Ronnie Earl or Joe Pass styled tunes, I didn't get it.In a disappointing selection of twangy country tunes this CD wallows in a well executed but unfulfilling sea of cowboy music. It recieves two stars from me only because the musicianship is excellent. If you like country and I mean real country music you will find this worthwile. I gave mine away and was glad to be rid of it."
3,A page-turner,"I was intrigued most by Ribbons through the main character, Robin. Because I grew up in a home where I had two brothers who always got their way, it was easy for me to relate to the injustice that surrounds Robin's life. Robin is a very gifted young adult who cherishes ballet as her one means of expression. When it is taken away from her she is not able to understand why, or understand the implications her continuing may have. Robin's grandmother, who knows first-hand what it is like to injure one's feet understands firmly that Robin must stop her ballet; however, she doesn't understand the passion that Robin has for her art and the division between the two is clear. I recommend this book for any young adult who is facing cultural challenges or the challenges and injustices that go along with having siblings and growing up. Anyone can relate, and most can empathize."
3,connects the hearts of women across the world,"This book runs the gamet of female emotions and tells us words we've all familiar with. For me, this book was very familiar. I was left nodding in agreement after quite a few poems. There are quite a few excellent poems but they are sadly balanced by a few un-poetic attempts to run words together in a seemingly poetic way."
3,Love Poems,"There is something about reading that which you can relate to that is inherently beautiful. I found that some of these poems were really beautiful and quite well done. However, I was slightly disappointed that more weren't so. Some of them seemed rushed without thought or edit. Although you may not agree...the only way to judge is to read the book yourself. There isn't any harm in it. We lesbians should read and support all lesbian writing."
5,flying ribbons,"RibbonsCharacters: robin paw paw IanRobin is a wonderful dancer and she isn't afraid to show it. Her dance instructor shows the whole class what they should dance like using robin as an example. Robin has just been moved up to the senior class where they where the point shoes with the ribbons that swirl around their ankles. She is so excited she can't imagine what life would be like without dance until she has to. She has found out that her parents have gone bankrupt so she can't pay for dance. When her grandmother came over, it got worse. Her grand mother told her she couldn't practice dance, because of what it did to her feet. Robin thinks all is lost until she finds out her grandmothers secret!I think this book is funny and exciting. This book could be recommended to everybody, but mostly for dancers because they would know what it would be like to have dance taken away. I give this book 5/5 stars because I think that it was very exciting."
4,Obscure Canadian Act,"Sticky Fingers is a Toronto studio act identical to the better known group THP Orchestra. Same players, vocalists, and producers. It is also closely related to the group Southern Exposure-- only the vocalists differ. This album was originally released in 1978 and features the Duncan Sisters on vocals. Despite the cheesy cover photo (a trademark of the projects coming out of Three Hats Productions), this album is the strongest of all of these acts. The songwriting is more polished, the arrangements more sophisticated, the singing more soulful. The sisters Duncan acquit themselves very well, with choral-style vocal arrangements. The project feels remarkably like soulful New York disco. Although the Rose Royce-esque ""Party Song"" was the track that made a small dent on the Disco Top 40 charts, ""Wastin' My Love"" and ""Takin' A Chance"" are even better, bringing to mind the group Change with a bit more attitude. Definitely recommended for fans of disco and dance music."
2,Did not feel this album,"I love Killa Tay and Guce but this CD was weak, musically speaking. Don't get me wrong, the lyrics are tight and are always tight but the beats aren't as hardcore as they usually are. If you want that gangsta shhhh, pick up Kingpins Only, because T.C. and Reg produce a lot of the songs. The first song, ""Bay Area,"" is coo Bcuz it's a spin off of Tupac's song, ""Ambitions of a Rider."" But almost ever subsequent song had weak beats. That is bizzare Bcuz Killa Tay can produce, check out the album ""Dosia,"" (w/ Lunasick & KJ) on AWOL records, now that is Gangsta. Guce's old school albums are much better too, like Pure Pressue and Clear and Present Danger, now that's Gangsta shhh wit that phonk! you know what I mean! Peep out Hitman's Solo Creep as well for that 415 phonk!"
3,Entertaining Obscurities,"I can't imagine that either of these pieces would ever become part of the standard repertory, but they are both enjoyable. The two composers Parry and Stanford are often thought of in tandem, but their styles have distinct differences. Both obviously take certain stylistic mannerisms from Brahms, but Parry also throws in a bit of Wagner as well while Stanford's music often evokes Irish folk song and myth. Parry's concerto is more adventurous in structure than Stanford's but both have a broad sweeping feeling to them. Both men were highly accomplished composers and these two pieces are by no means simple for the soloist. The orchestra acquits itself well and as usual with Hyperion releases the disk has a good warm sound to it."
2,Weak point in the series,"A pair of pretty weak concertos, although Lane is superb as always and is ably backed by the SSO. They are just not able to inject much life into these two lame pieces. The Sanford is a bit more livelier than the droll Parry, though it tends to drag itself on and on without leaving much of an impression. I suppose the RPC series can't all be winners..."
2,The very best--NOT!,"I don't believe that there is such a thing as a bad Patsy Cline album, but naming this collection ""The Very Best..."" is ridiculous. Anyone even somewhat familiar with Ms. Cline's work will know this, but new listeners will be better served by picking up ""The Patsy Cline Story""."
2,"First problem, you can't start these jobs today.","Here are some of the do-able jobs Jacobson writes about:apartment managermassage therapistpersonal cheffactory go-betweenstart your own 900 numbercasino jobshotel helprestaurant workkaroke performerprivate mail carrierhairstylistbraille transcriberDo these jobs seem like you can start them today? I was hoping to find ways to supplement my income, instead these are for unemployed or underemployed people who want to create a new line of work for themselves and are willing to invest some money and time. Also, some of these jobs are specific to areas of the country so if you want to be a script reader or location manager, you will have to move to the right geographically location. Sorry, for those who wanted to stay in Idaho and pursue their career as a party enhancer (p110)!"
2,This book was too old to be of much use.,"Did not care for this book, in it's time, it may have been a 5 star, but it is too old now. A lot of the jobs it lists are passe."
3,my mum loves it,my parents love it...they use it every other day..they love to see who has more fat and more water...i really dunno how much of this is true...but it works well.
2,I would pass,"The wieght is accurate, but the body fat is way off. I had my body fat done 6 months ago by a doctor and I was 12% six months later I wiegh 5 lbs less and the scales says I'm 25%. something is off and I trust the doctor. If all you want is to see your wieght its fine, but the rest... well find another scale."
2,Not happy with this scale,I've had this scale for over 10 days now but I am returning it tomorrow morning. It is not accurate AT ALL.
1,This scale does everything but tell you your weight,"This is the most unusable product I can remember buying. First, the ad said nothing about someone with a pacemaker not being able to use it, and my wife has one. Second, it comes up with a bunch of numbers but no matter what I do, it will not give me my weight, which is what I bought it for in the first place. If you want to know how much you weigh, don't buy this ""scale"".Auguste Schwab Jr"
3,It's okay...,"It's inexpensive and it looks good. I entered my info for the body fat results simply enough. One thing I didn't care for is my height had to be entered in cm, but since it's entered only once, that's not so bad.My main problem with this scale is the steps you must go through to turn it on. You have to hit the ON button with your toe, then within 3 seconds you have to hit it again, then once the scale goes to 0.0, you get on and it eventually gets to your weight. I feel for the weight measurement, you should just step on the thing and get a result.The bodyfat aspect seems fine so far. From what I have seen, most of these types of units are not too accurate for actual bodyfat, but they are fine for measuring progress. I have not had it long enough to know how accurate that aspect is, but will try to update this review if I continue to use it."
2,Cheap,"In less than two weeks of light use, one of the feet broke off, rendering the scale useless. The scale is unintuitive to use (why can't you just tap it to turn it on, rather than reaching down to press a button?). The LCD isn't backlit so it's very hard to read if you're not in the best of lighting.I am very wary of the accuracy of the body fat measurements - I had this in my dorm room and one of the guys from across the hall who works out all the time and doesn't have an ounce of fat on him consistently registered 10% or more, whereas another kid registered lower than him, but has considerably more body fat. (Yes, we went through the annoying process of creating profiles for each individual)I would not recommend this scale to anyone"
2,Not worth the money.,This scale does not weigh correctly. Your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in. I counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time I used it. This is one of the least accurate scales I've ever used.Spend the extra money to get a higher quality non-digital scale.
1,"okay, but it broke too soon","Exacta is easy to set up, lightweight, and not conspicuously bad-looking in the bathroom. I like it for its consistent results, and being relatively accurate compared to doctor's office scale. Of course there is no way to know how accurate the body fat calculations are. Maybe looking at differences is the way to go.I loved it and may be using it a bit too often (3 times a day) before it mysteriously stopped working after 3 months...Think twice if you are tempted!update: it has a three-year warrnatee and leifheit is willing to exchange. i will see how that goes"
1,"Not happy,","I purchased this scale because I wanted to keep track of my body fat and water. It does neither accurately. It gives your correct weight but that is all. Also, it is not easy to program. It uses only the meteric system for your height.The one good thing I can say about the scale is that it is slim and attractive which is what I want to be."
3,Panasonic just never quite gets it,I had previously owned 6 Panasonic cameras in this class for my wedding studio. We loved them. I purchased this camera last year and pretty much hate it. The menus are hard to use - the flipout LCD is a joke.Footage was much better with the Panasonic Ag-DVC15. Panasonic went backwards with this model
1,Very Dissapointed,"This camera with three ccd lack of brilliants color and the low ligth performance is too bad that i decided to sell it and buy and HV20 or HV30, controls are hard to use, the AG-DVC7 is a better model than this, panasonic went too backwards with this cameral, if u plan to buy a camera, get the sony hdr1000 o the canon GL2."
5,Men's Silk Pajamas,"The pajamas are beautiful! They wash up very well by hand in cold water. They are so soft and sexy, and they please not only who wears them but who looks at them on the wearer. However, the price was a bit too high. If they had been about $20 cheaper, I would have bought another pair."
1,Don' be FOOLED! This is NOT from the Broadway Show!!,"I bought this after searching for years for the Broadway cast of 1994. I mistakenly thought this was an English version of the same play. Far from it. If you want a badly sung nothing to do with Broadway version, then buy this album."
1,"BAD, BAD Musical","I'm not going to even mention how awful this recording is [....]I will tell you there is a german recording for their production of Cyrano: the Musical (w/ a bass singing Cyrano!) It's god awful too.Also, there is a symphonic recording of the musical by the Dutch National Radio Symphony (or something like that) which is quite good.Third, I've seen a bootleg video of the broadway production which is the worst audio and the best version. If you can find it; GET IT! Anne Runndolfson (am I spelling it correctly?) gives the most amazing performance as Roxanne. (BTW- Bennett Jordan plays the lead and is great too.)"
1,Deffinately not even close to the Broadway version,"Remember *the only recording of the 1994 Broadway version is the Dutch one.* There is no English recording, and I'd rather listen to that one which I don't understand than this one which I do. It makes a slight attempt to maintain the themes of integrity and honor from the original play, but other than a brief mention of staying set apart and doing one's best in the final song, it's equally guilty as any modernization of their greatest flaw: not realizing that the love story is secondary to the character study. Not only did the version that landed on Broadway keep this straight, but it also dived into character farther. There is no ""Hate Me"" or ""Moonsong"" on this CD."
4,Nice Item,"I purchased this for a 6 year old boy and he had no problem putting this set together. Keeping the parts together was another matter, however. The directions are clear and it was fun to put together. I don't prefer to give toy guns to children, so if this is a problem you might want to look at another set or take the guns out beforehand."
5,A Wonderful Thrill!,I loved these books each character had one or two original traits of their own but I do wish we got a little more information on Mr.Radford the mate who seems to always wake up on the wrong side of the bed and captain Cascadden seems just a little boring a nice funny guy is always in a story I liked the fact that each kid had their own opinions on everybody and everything and they also told their story with thoughts what a great trilogy! I wonder what happened to the mate though after he gets outta prison though does he like seek revenge or what?
1,Very bland.,"I found these to be very bland books, with little to no character development throughout the whole series. The idea was very good, but the author just didn't have the talent, nor the drive to actually want it to work out."
3,IsLaNd ReViEw,"Island was a all right book. I did not like this book because this book had no magic like wand or wizards and no real exciting parts in it. I did like this book because it had a good meaning to it and it uses life skill's in it.It uses life skills like courage, and responsibility. The reason I gave it a *** is because it was kind of dull and then when the big storm came it was kind of exciting.I would recommended this book to only people that like survival books and people that like to really really read. Out of 4 people in my reading group 2 out of 4 liked this book and the others did not like this book. [I was told] not to be mean but next time you write a book like island, you should get better people to put on the book like me and some of my friends.Anyways your book was pretty good and my friend ... told me that your 2nd and 3rd book of island was better, so I might read the others and do another report on them. If you read my report, thanks. That's the end of my report thanks."
1,what the?????????????????????,I thought this book was confusing. I had to read the book twice to understand it. I would not recommend this book to some one that wants adventure on the first page. This book takes time to get to the adventure. I dislike how the author did not put a lot description of the setting and the characters. I didn't get a good visual of the characters. This book is in a sear. The second book gets a little of the adventure. You have to read the sears to get every little clue. In the back of the book you see six kids. From the description of the book you do not know who's who. This book is for patient people that can wait for the adventure. If I was a teacher and I was grading this paper I would give this paper a C. and even mybe a D- i hated it i would not recomened this book to any one. i hope you will read the ad relize THAT THIS BOOK WAS REALLY REALLY BAD.
2,BOOK LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN ON SHELF FOR 20 YRS,THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BOXED SET. nO BOX AND ONLY ONE BOOK WITH ALL THREE PARTS OF TRILOGY INCLUDED. THE BOOK WAS VERY YELLOWED WITH AGE ...DID NOT LOOK NEW. DISAPPOINTING AS I BOUGHT FOR GIFT.
3,So-so scale,I wish I could agree with those who praise the accuracy of this scale. Ours is not so reliable. If I step on it 4 times in succession I can get 4 different readings. The high and low readings can vary by about 6 pounds. My husband gets similarly uncertain results.
1,Two Soehnle 63702 - none work yet,"I bought a Soehnle from a M. Parizek from Sahuarita AZ, through eBay; Amazon is selling and shipping it instead, go figure!Anyhow, after returning my first Soehnle that displays funky numbers in lieu of real values (and for mighty shipping expenses); I got back another item that display flawed behavior 2 weeks after using it. Pushing gently the scale to display the 0.0 is not working consistently. You have to drop the scale from one or two inches high to get the display to come up. I am going to contact Soehnle for the warranty now."
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"We started using this on our daughter when vacationing in South Carolina. She had very sensitive skin and the sun and mosquitoes were brutal. It worked so well for her, my wife and I tried it on ourselves. It worked well for us, also.The sunscreen is very effective. The insect repellent is not as good as DEET, but it does not smell as bad as DEET and, more importantly, it does not irritate skin the way DEET can. The citronella wears off before the sunscreen does, so you have to reapply frequently if swimming or sweating (which can get expensive). During the day, the insect repellent works reasonably well. However, the insect repellent is not very good at night in the Low Country. We have to use something like OFF! or Cutter then if we do not want to get bitten.Overall, a good product, if not exceptional."
2,Kind of mean...,"In a way, the book reminded me of Judy Blume's book ""Blubber."" I thought it was so cruel of Jana & her friends to form an ""Against Taffy Sinclair"" club. Sure Taffy tended to be self-important and snobby, but that doesn't give Jana the right to gang up on her. I can imagine how painful that is for a kid when a clique forms a ""club for the purpose of ganging up on her. The BSC would have been horrified at this ""club."" In the book, the club gets together to badmouth Taffy and write awful things about her in their notebooks. Poor Taffy! I was SO glad when Taffy's mother got hold of Jana's notebook in the end and came over to Jana's place and let Jana really have it! Maybe Ms. Sinclair should have made good on her threat to take it to the principal."
2,Not the headstock I expected,"I expected the Fender style headstock according to the photos, but received the square sawed off look instead. Here's to hoping my son can bare to look at it."
2,Crap,"I don't know if its all of them or just mine. But my guitar blows. The tuners are harder than hell to turn. The strings keep hitting other frets so they buzz a lot and I have them as high as they'll go and they wont tune for crap. I have them tuned the best it will and it still sounds horrible and out of tune. And worst of all, IT DOESNT EVEN FREAKING WORK!! I put it together exactly how I was told to step by step. Everything was done perfectly exept for my amature paint job. But however it was fun to build and id love to do it again. Id like to buy another one in hopes that it works. Since there's no contact seller so I can't get another one for free. Cause I definitely can't return it with a yellow burst paint job. So amazon if you read this, Id like another one on you since mines just a hunk of wood now."
5,The biology of cancer,"Book was in great condition, contained the original CD. very happy with the book A++++++++++++++++++.Will order from this person again. Thank you"
4,Excellent overview,This book is an excellent source of information for both students and professionals. It overviews the basics of cancer and cancer treatment in a detailed and accessible way.
4,Good text book,"I read about this book on one of the prominent academic magazines, perhaps Nature. I have gone through only a few of the chapters. It is easy-reading, lots of pictures and extra information on the CD. Good for an introduction to the subject."
5,a comprehensive review of molecular oncology,"it covers everything from bench to bed: tumor viruses, oncogene/tsg, signaling, turmorigenesis, individual cancers, drug development.....i always wonder how come the author knows so much....it is a wonderul review. i recomend it to all physcian scientists, translational researchers, graduate students.."
3,Decent book,"Its a good book as far as textbooks go. We needed it for my Biology of Cancer class, but we didnt use it a whole lot. It was hard for me to read the chapters sometimes but it was an interesting book."
5,Les Baxter Is The Real Star Of This Fantastic Set,"The is a wonderful collection of recordings, hilighting the incredible Theremin playing of Sam Hoffman, but the totally unique sound on this recording is due to the fascinating arrangements of master composer Les Baxter. Baxter changed the face of popular (and classical) music with his unique arrangements for Yma Sumac, Bas Sheva, Hoffman and Nat ""King"" Cole -- not to mention his own incredible series of Exotica recordings and his million selling pop songs. Baxter's recording of THE POOR PEOPLE OF PARIS was the largest selling single of the entire 1950s.Finally, Baxter wrote well over 140 amazing film scores and many concert hall pieces as well Someday these compositions will make a lot of money for the company that has the guts to take a chance on releasing some of these amazing compositions."
3,"one very good, two not bad","I liked the third CD best - Music for Peace of Mind which did not feature a chorus. I thought the chorus on the other two discs tended to drown out the wonderful, ethereal sound of the theremin - which was my main reason for buying the set in the first place."
2,Maybe??,"Be advised that as long as the Clara Rockmore theremin performances are available, others with this extremely difficult instrument to play in performance will have to prove themselves against the 'grand master' of this instrument. Messiaen, Fuleihan, Varese, among others, have writen pieces using this instrument, either solo in groups of other instruments, or several in orchestral groups, great though these compositions be, the solo Rockmore with her sister, Nadia Reisenstein performances still are the 'bench marks' of what can be done on and with a theremin and should be heard more. The 1940s Rockmore performance of the Fuleihan 'Concerto for Theremin', with Stokowski, and also the premiere recording of the Varese 'Ionisation', conducted by it dedicatee, Nicolas Slonymski in 1933 are great recordings of historical importance on the same cd."
5,Great Shoes!,"Great shoes, they are very cute! It is exactly as described, brand new! I love how they feel! It's a gift, so I'm hoping to get a good reaction from the person I'm giving these shoes to!"
3,"Nice looking shoes, but........","I loved these shoes. Until the seam started coming apart my second time wearing them. They run a tad small, but they do give a bit as you wear them."
2,One big commercial for X-10... the product,"Nothing in the splash page, back cover or anywhere with info letting you know it is almost 100% about the X10 hardware. I already own a house full of X10 stuff, so the fact that I wasted money on this book burns my soul. Not one thing deals with how to set up, rig or configure any of the projects without having to spend money on whichever X-10 product will do the job. If I wanted that I would just buy the product and read the installation guide that comes with it.The author suckered me into buying the book... don't let him sucker you!"
5,Just what I needed,"I'd been looking for something just like this to complete a project. Item shipped quickly, arrived in perfect condition and was just as described."
5,Works well. Use a smaller punch.,"It worked to my satisfaction. The punch could be slightly too large to weaken the fabric too much. Fortunately, I have a smaller punch I can use for my purposes."
1,Not exactly as advertised,"While the grommet kit claims to contain 48 grommets, it does not. In fact, it contains 24 grommets - 24 eyelets and 24 washers. Beyond that, the grommet kit functions exactly as advertised and does a good job. A little lubrication of the die set helps to avoid grommets sticking to the die and striker."
3,Useless punch / OK grommets,The punch for cutting holes is useless. The grommets themselves are fine and the tools for forming the two parts into a grommet work adequately. Provided you have another method for making the holes this is a perfectly satisfactory product.
2,48 pieces....not grommets. Package does not specify weather-resistance,"I read weather proof and 48 grommets and thought it was a steal. There are 24-I double checked the description and it does say both, I did not catch that the first time. Luckily I ended up not needing 48... Package does not specify weather resistance, that is important to me. The add said rustproof..I have had brass grommets rust out quickly, I'm going to use them, but so far kinda gimmicky."
3,A Good Read,"This was an interesting read if you enjoy the old films like I do. Most of the book doesn't deal with old films, but rather all the aspects of visual censorship - billboards, advertising, etc. It's a quick read, but well worth the effort."
5,Great for muscle tension!,"This product is great for helping with muscle tension or pain anywhere in the body, but I find it very useful for the tenseness and stiffness I get in the neck and shoulders! Helps ward off migraines too that are due to tension.....good stuff!"
1,No Success,"I was disappointed that the Titanium Discs did not work for me. They did not make my pain issues worse, but certainly didn't take away any of my pain. If they work for you great...but they didn't for me."
3,should have been so much more,"Read this book and you will learn how to tow your boat all across the united states, while getting in precious little sailing. There is a guide at the back with short suggestions on possible sailing locations. I was excited to find this book, since Larry Brown's ""frugal yachting"" seems to have a devoted audience. But I was dissappointed. It could and should have been so much more."
1,Junk Scholarship and Junk Logic,"This book is a notorious piece of total junk: junk logic, junk scholarship, junk law. Huber popularized the inspired neologism ""junk science"" to denigrate views and outcomes he didn't like. Since publication this book has been praised by those who don't want any interference with corporate behavior, no matter how reprehensible, and vilified by those on the other side. In the middle are a broad range of scholars who have pointed out the sloppy scholarship, nonexistent historiography, and misleading choice of examples. Real junk. Get it from the library. Huber is already rich enough charging huge lecture fees from his corporate clack. An excellent and balanced book on this subject is Sheila Jasanoff's, Science at the Bar."
3,text book,It's an okay read. The author seem to be a bit wordy when explaining and using examples. For some that may be a good thing. It does give great detail.
5,Hitting the Nail on the Head,"Huber has presented a flawless indictment of so many in the legal profession. I don't recall Shakespeare's exact words, but he wrote something to the effect of ""first kill all the lawyers."" These fellows have a huge racket and will do anything to silence those who would expose them. The legal system in the country needs a cleansing, and Huber's book is a fine place to get the process started. It needs to be read widely and acted upon."
4,loved this,I bought this so I would have something to do with my kids and I thought crafts would be good. But my daughters ( 5 & 3) were too young to know how to do it. so I did it myself. I didn't know how fun it was. I liked doing it so much I bought 5 more. Lol.
1,No needle,No needle like it says inthe package? No invoice either inside the box. It should say there is no needle instead of saying it does.
5,KC lights,"First of all this set is very bright. and I couldnt resist it when I saw them for 75.00 and free shipping. what a deal !! these are so bright and produce a spot light beam. I mounted them on a Aries push bar on the front of my 05 Xterra. I 'm very happy . I looked at getting the hella's and PIAA but for the price I was sold on KC.the only problem I have so far is tring to adjust the lights to my perfection. at first they pointed at the ground 20ft in frount of me and now I have them pointing up at the trees. I guess good for coon hunting but, I still have some adjusting to do.The kit provided everything that you need and was very easy to install. I did replace the rocker switch with one that would fit in my existing switch holders.the lights are built for a tank and I believe they can last 20 something years. but how many cars would that be?I'm still looking for some KC rock guard covers.buy them on sale the lights are worth it"
3,Don't judge the book by the cover.,"Back Cover description: Theo Atrides is wealthy, powerful and successful. Leandra has no intention of being his next conquest. But when they are forced to spend a week together on his private island, Theo decides to do whatever it takes to make Lea surrender. Faced with his relentless plan of seduction, she finds the challenge of resisting the gorgeous Greek playboy too much to bear...Theo thinks Lea is his cousin's mistress. The cousin is gay and doesn't want his family to know about it-Lea is camouflage. Theo's grandfather has Lea kidnapped and sent to Theo's private island. The story develops from there and Theo makes a few other errors before realizing he is in love"
3,"good fun, with no substance","this movie is about a man who is the only survivor of a bloody motorcycle war and is bent on escaping the law and his past, only to end up in the middle of another motorcycle war. this movie is about redemption as this time he sides with the good (a group of native americans fighting for their land) against men who are shadows of himself.If the acting had been better anf the plot had less holes this could have been a truly great biker flick. As it is the movie is entertaining, despite its problems, but no great find."
2,Rebel Run,"This movie is really bad. The acting is plain awful except Michael Ironside. I don't get the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc-gangs. He comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian-land. At the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home-town, I didn't hear that in the movie, if so it wasn't clear.Richard Grieco was one hell of a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He said his lines like it too. And we wouldn't talk about Sean Young, she hasn' been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She is awful.When I rented it I choosed between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I choosed this one because of Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge.Don't see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses."
4,"Different...but ""Grande...?""","First of all, Hamelin's ability shouldn't be questioned...my only complaint is that perhaps some of the passages were played too fast...and even though I confess to having a bias for piano compostions that have a certain ""cohesiveness,"" this music reminded me of a half-finished, abstract painting.There is some interesting music here...BUT... I think most listeners will find Alkan's music ""unapproachable."" I'm afraid this CD will quickly find it's way to the back of your collection..."
5,A magnificent album,"Exciting, brilliant sound. The best rendition of Le festin d'Esope of the three I own. This CD is a valuable part of my collection"
5,Great common rider cd,"this cd is great.common rider is great.this cd is more punk and ska than this is unity music but there both good. this cd has some great tracks like radio waves,concious burning,a place where we can stay. This is good for just sitting around the house on a hot summer day drinking lemonade. its very mellow.get this cd and then get this is unity music.join my common rider forum too commonrider.iboardplus.com"
2,Disappointing,"gee...i must be the only one disappointed with this album. Yes, Jesse still kept his lyrics strong, but the music didn't have that catchy energy that OPIV and his other band, ""The Silencers"" had. I like to keep my mind open to music and this band does have some talent, but most songs are soft and just plain ""boring."" If you are into punk/ska like me, you might want to think twice before you buy this one. If you like soft rocksteady/rock, go ahead and grab it. .....Jesse is still da man"
3,Cheap boots for a cheap price!!,I take horseback riding lessons every other week. After the first two weeks of use the heel started coming off on the left boot. I returned the boots and got ones of better quality (not Saxon). Other then that they were pretty durable and that might have just been a problem with the ones that i received.
4,Great intro to Fat Possum's music: mix of delta blues & punk,"This is Fat Possum's latest sampler. It features several obscure Delta artists, such as Cedell Davis from Pine Bluff, AR and Johnny Farmer. Davis' music is unique since he was crippled as a child by polio and plays slide with a butter knife. The sampler also features better known artists such as R.l. Burnside with his new ""hip-hop"" sound and the late great Mississippi juke joint proprioter Junior Kimbrough. The CD also includes Bob Log III and Twenty Miles. These guys are more akin to punk than they are to ""real"" blues, but they are young musicians harkening back to solid blues roots with a punk twist. Give Fat Possum a listen!"
1,63 pages in large type print!,"I can't believe I paid for this. Its a tiny little booklet with simplistic ideas like this one: Talk about something fun your child will be doing the next day. Tell her she needs to get a good night's rest to be ready for her fun day. Now she has a good reason to want to go to sleep. It's the ""means to an end"" theory. It works! That was page 55. I got more ideas just surfing the net. A real book of 280 pages with actual plans and solutions is The No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley."
1,It's a Cult,"Silva Mind Control is described as a destructive mind control cult by the respected researcher Dr. Singer in her book, ""Cults in Our Midst"". She lists many of the common negative side effects of destructive mind control cults in her book including depression and psychosis.Other books that may be of help in recovering from a destructive mind control relationship include ""Combatting Cult Mind Control"" by Steven Hassan, ""The Stormy Search for the Self"" by Christina Grof and Stan Grof, M.D., ""Spiritual Emergency"" edited by Stan Grof, M.D. and Christina Grof, and ""A Path with Heart - A Guide Through the Perils and Promises of Spiritual Life"" by Jack Kornfield."
5,It'll make you analize and make your life a better one!!!,The book had been laying around the house for a long time and one day I was feeling down and started reading it. It made me value my life more and helped me accept the things that come my way. It has helped me solve problems and it's helping me in my relationships. It's a great book that will definately make you analyze yourself and will help you live at ease.
1,Waste of moneey,"I bought this item at a local store in San Francisco, and it really sucks!Ate the tape twice; the buttons for stop and start jammed with each other and oh, it takes 4 AAA batteries and doesn't come with an adapter"
4,Inexpensive tool to save Video camera motor!,Works as expected. It isn't supposed to be precision crafted swiss timepiece but it works dependably and does exactly what I bought it for.
4,Nice Gloves,"Good work out gloves, padding is enough. I got the Medium and they tend to fit my mid sized hands perfect. They are snug but not too small, the way gloves should be. I do not recommend getting a size up as some suggest, because they will be lose and the wrist strap will not feel good on you, I tried all sizes before I bought."
4,best gloves for the price.,all I can say is that the gloves are great. Only down side with the black ones are that they leave black residue on your face if you wipe the sweat from your forehead.
5,Great Gloves.,"I've had these gloves for about 6 months now, and they work great. I have no complaints. They don't smell, and they fit well. My hands no longer get blisters. Aaahhhhh. =)"
4,Weight Gloves,"I have bought this product in the past, and have found these gloves to be best weight lifting gloves for the money. They hold up better than other gloves that I have purchased. Will buy again when these gloves wear out sometime next year. I put the gloves thru a lot, as I work out four or five days per week, and my typical session lasts for about 90 minutes."
1,Not the ones in the picture,Not the gloves in the pic and when I tried to return them because the were the wrong ones they told me they aren't the wrong ones. Do not buy them.
1,Size issue,"I ordered medium sized gloves (as the size chart suggested me being a medium) and the gloves that were shipped were much smaller in size. I faced a lot of difficulty trying to grip onto weights and it just resulted in painful palms after the workout. I went to a sports store recently and saw the exact same ""medium"" sized gloves and they fit perfectly. I went back home to check whether my gloves were mistakenly marked as medium even though they were small but I don't think that was the case. Maybe the seller storing conditions might have affected the quality of the product. Long story short - I was not satisfied at all."
2,Lower quality than previous versions,"I purchased the Harbinger 143 gloves at a local retailer recently, to replace a well-worn pair (which lasted some years). The new gloves have less than half the padding of the previous model and the leather is thinner. The fit and stitching seem good. I would not recommend these as they do not offer sufficient protection for your hands, mainly in terms of proper padding."
3,"Harbinger Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glove (Black, Small)","good material, it is a bit unconfortable while working out because the interior sewing lines can print lines on your hand. That makes me unconfortable. some people cares, some don't. you have to judge it yourself."
4,GREAT!,"I got them for my boyfriend who started lifting, hes says they're great. They help with hand pains so he can lift heavier weights and for longer durations. For beginners, I would strongly recommend!"
4,Order one size bigger.,"Great gloves for the money! But with this said make sure to order one size bigger than you want. I ordered these gloves the first time in M, but too small, then in L, but one glove fit perfit and the other too small. I ordered gloves one more time in L again and a perfit fit end of story."
4,Well constructed gloves,Pleased with the overall workmanship of these workout gloves. The palms and fingers are well padded and the stitching is solid. They are a bit snug even though I bought them a size larger than my previous gloves based on other reviews that they tend to run smaller in size. I would purchase these gloves again.
3,Nice padding but not comfy. Too small.,"I am a pretty skinny guy and size Large was still too small. The gloves are nicely padded, but not comfortable at all. I returned it and got the GoFit ones instead."
4,Runs a bit small,These are great workout gloves for the price. Great ventilation and protection during a hard workout. The only problem I have with the gloves is that it runs a bit small.
3,Itchy but strong,i got these gloves for airsoft i get hit in the hand alot in CQB bit i dont whant my finger tips gone so i use theese :D a bit itchy.
3,Buy at least 2 sizes bigger,"The gloves work great but are tough to get back off. Whatever size you think you are, buy 2 sizes bigger if possible. I bought one size larger but they are still tough to get off and feel a little tight. I stretched this out so it is starting to feel a little better."
3,Good workout glove,"Decent pair of workout gloves for those of you who do not prefer padding in your workout gear. If you like lots of padding, I would not recommend this product."
5,Comfortable work out glove,Bought these for my husband since he was getting calluses on his palms from weight lifting. He said they are a comfortable fit and he can get a better grip now too. No more calluses either.
2,Not the same,"I bought one of these gloves a while ago, and what I can say about this new one is that the size is smaller, it didn't fit my hands as the old one (both size S), and the sewing is a little bit different too, a little uncomfortable. Preferred the old model"
2,Not the one for me,"Based on the metrics to determine the size I need to buy, I found myself to be a medium and purchased one only to find out that its a little tight.I would have returned this product any way because the material used was so rough, I felt that I would get more callous on my hands by using this product than not using it."
4,Great quality,"So the gloves are nice. Comfy, good padding, well-constructed.I'm a decently heavy lifter (max: 120lb dumbbells in each hand). Nothing even remotely close to some people, but I can push some weight and the gloves have def saved my hands.Only neg thing would be the area where the fingers come together seem a little deep... its hard to explain, but the webbing area inbetween your fingers can get sore because the gloves are... deep-fingered?Anyway... id def buy them again. Harbinger is the S!"
2,Does not breathe,Did not breathe at all and seemed not size was right. Going o continue to look for a better glove
2,had to return them,"I've used Harbinger gloves in the past, and recently got these. But I had to return them because the stitching at the wrist near the label pulled away after two wearings, and it seems like other parts of the stitching will do the same soon. They were also very small; I got an XL based on my prior pair being XL, but these felt like M or L."
5,These are the best weight-lifting gloves,"I wish these gloves were available everywhere, and wonder why not. I've tried many kinds - and these are the best - fit great, grip well, comfortable, and protect my hands just the way I want. I bought an extra pair and fear the day I can no longer get them."
4,"Solid, comfortable glove","I lift intensely four times a week, and this glove offers great protection and will last you up to a year. Very good buy, especially for the price."
4,A good glove,"I've owned a pair of Harbinger gloves before so I wasn't concerned about the size. I like these a lot, nicely padded, fit well. I haven't tried to wash them yet - so we'll have to see how that works out. So far, I can recommend them."
1,Misleading Sizing and Pricing!!!! Seller would not exchange!,"Misleading Sizing and Pricing!!!! Seller would not exchange!Seller offers 2 xl sizes which are very small and made to fit a girl, so I gave the first pair to my girlfriend.The 2nd xl that I bought for myself/again, was $3 more and was the exact same small size.Seller would not exchange the 2nd pair.BUYERS BEWARE!"
1,Very Very Small!,"It is ridiculous how small these run. I bought a mens large for my husband who has thin fingers and small hands, they don't even come close to fitting. They even felt tight when I put them on. Total waste unless you like returning."
3,"Becareful guys, Large is too small","I thought my hand is a regular size (medium). Therefore, I decided to order a ""Large"" size. However, it was toooo small and tooooo tight.I recommend ""Extra Large"" for medium size hands. In other words, choose 2 grades upper than your real hand size."
3,Could fit a lot better,"The Haringer Pro FlexClosure 143 gloves are OK at best. The sizing guide is not very accurate. My hand measure 8"" which according to their guide is a M or L. I ordered the L and getting the gloves on and off isn't very easy. I have to pull on each side separate to pull them off. Also, the gloves cut into the finger's webbings so it isn't very comfortable. Getting the gloves at your local Walmart would be cheap and of good quality. I also hand washed the gloves. The dye however kept coming and coming when trying to wring them out. Letting it sit in water make the whole water black. I change the water multiple times and it had the same results...disappointed about this. I wonder what would happen if I put it in the wash with my other clothes. However, Harbinger does seem to have very good customer service."
5,Amazing Gloves,I love these gloves because they help my hands stay smoothe and still allow me to pound the weights. Thanks gloves.
4,Good for training,This gloves are OK for training. They run a bit small but they work just fine for mel Hopefuly they last.
4,Solid Pair of gloves,A pretty good pair gloves with comfortable padding. It's tight enough to be able to train comfortably. The colors on the inside of the glove has faded already after about 10 sessions. I really don't care much about the color though as long as it does not rip.
2,"don't feel comfortable, even hurt a bit","These just felt bulky in all the wrong places of the hand. After using them for lifting my hands (nerves/ligaments) were actually hurting, especially towards the end of the workout (while they did not hurt while doing the same sets w/o the gloves on prior days). I have average hands and ordered size L - yet they were very tight still - difficult to put on and even more pain to take off later (had to pull off each finger separately). It's funny, I had some gloves that came with a Makita circular saw and since I had nothing else I used those for lifting - and my hands felt much more comfortable in those gloves than in these. I would not recommend these gloves."
3,Good solid gloves for the price,These gloves were a pretty good buy. They definitely run small so GET A SIZE UP. I up-sized and still get some minor pinching between my fingers and the palm leather-area seems to have a few unwanted folds when I grip.Initially they are rough and need a lot of breaking in to. Don't be afraid to pull out the scissors and make small cuts to relieve some of the pinching areas.
4,looks cool,"ADV: Grab feeling is good, glove is neither too thick nor too thin. looks cool(I bought the yellow version)DISADV: the side of 2nd knot of thumb is not protected by leather but by nylon. Sometimes when I'm holding heavy dumbell, the 2nd knot of my thumbs will be touching or worn by the sideface of the plate of dumbells(maybe my holding way is not so correct) and nylon cannot provide enough protection. I would prefer the the side of 2nd knot of thumb can also be covered by leather."
3,"Nice-looking, but didn't work well in action","They look and feel great when you put them on, but the finger tubes are a bit too long and when I lifted any heavy weights, they would dig into the skin on my middle finger. So I had to return them, unfortunately, because otherwise I really liked them."
4,Great fit!,"Excellet fit, glove measurement chart on Harbingers website was accurate enough as this was my first glove purchase.Comfortable and is great for working out."
2,Bad sizing,"Like many others have already said, the sizing runs way too small. I'm 5'9"", 165lbs, and I actually measured my hand (according to the image above) and I came out to large. I ordered large and what came was an extremely tight fit glove. I could hardly make a fist because it was so tight. I'm returning it for sure."
2,Runs small in size,"I've had multiple pairs of Harbinger gloves but a different model in the past. (and have always been satisfied) The XL's of this model were so small I thought they had to be a woman's size. FYI, this model seems to run very small in the XL size."
5,Great gloves,"I work out 3 times a week for about 5 hours total and use these gloves consistently. They work really well. The stitching is great, they are tight enough to allow for a good grip but are easy to remove without tearing them apart. I would definitely buy them again. BTW, I am 6'2"" and I bought the large size and they fit perfect."
4,Leather workout gloves,"Gloves are comfortable and made of real leather. The palms are all double thick leather to minimize calouses on your hand. I bought two pair and glad I did. This way, one can be in the wash, while I use the other pair. Great valueOne negative, it is a litlle short, i would have preferred a bit longer."
4,Exactly what I expected,These weightlifting gloves are exactly what I had hoped they would be. They fit well and provide the appropriate amount of padding.
4,nice but run small,"Nice quality for the price, but even if you follow the instructions for measuring, consider getting the next size up."
4,Great after adjustment,"The gloves are very comfortable. Make sure you buy a bigger size than normal and if that isn't enough you can always cut between fingers if it bothers (This was my case, but after cutting a small hole they are very comfortable and have a nice grab). Delivery was fast too."
5,Satisfied,I received what I expected in expected time. I have been using them since two weeks haven't had any problem yet. overall It's a good product. I would surely recommend it.
2,Strange fit and awkward sewing around fingers,"I think weightlifting gloves are one of those items that you really need to try on before purchasing. Nevertheless the price was right on Amazon so I took the plunge only to find out that the size wasn't ideal. I'm somewhere between a L and an XL, but the way these gloves were made I don't think either would have fit me quite right. The gloves look ok, but there was some strange sewing/fabric near the fingers that just irritated me enough to not want to wear them when lifting. Ever since my wife made me start lifting with gloves to avoid those manly callouses I can't lift without them, but I much prefer the Nike strength gloves which are made of a much thinner fabric and have a zipper to close as opposed to irritating velcro."
3,BOUGHT THE BIG ONES!,BOUGHT THE BIG ONES! AND THEY ARE TIGHT! I would size up if you have man hands like I do.
5,Recommended,I bought the gloves to protect my knuckles while doing knuckle push-ups. They were as described and totally worth the money.
2,tight,I wanted an xx large as i had tried an x large that was too tight. The xxlarge is almost as tight.
3,I bit tight for Large Size,"I bought this for use with my Mountain Bike & for fitness exercises, after the other ones I had fell apart. They seem well made, and do offer protection. I bought the large size since I didn't want them to be too tight, but unfortunately, they still are and cause some pain after extended use. I'm hoping they will break in eventually. Comfort level could be better."
1,Need to return,Bought these for my husband. He felt like they were too padded to do pull-ups and other non-bar exercises. Darn! Need to see if it is worth the $ to return ship it back.
2,I don't like them.,"When compared toValeo Ocelot Lifting Glovesthese gloves are crap. I bought both pairs and I think the Valeo is far superior. The 3/4 finger length is wonderful, they are softer leather, and have more cushioning than these Harbingers. Unfortunatly the Valeos have the same sizing issue as these, so read the reviews to find your correct size, don't count on the sizing charts. (For Valeo, Large is a perfect fit for my 8"" circumference hands, taken around the palm, under the knuckles)."
5,Great gloves for a good price,Love the grip and feel. Let them break in for a month and you are good. Took me almost 2 years of constantly working out to wear these out. Just ordered the same ones from amazon for the next two years.
2,These run SMALL,"I measured my hand per the photo. 9"" around, right in the middle of the XL size spec.My XL gloves barely fit me. They've stretched out a little, but they'll never be comfortable.Do yourself a favor and SIZE UP your order!!!"
3,Too SMALL,Followed the sizing chart and the gloves are so tight I can't grip a bar.My wife ordered a ladies' pair and hers fit perfectly.Obviously consistency is an issue.Otherwise they seem well made.
3,Workout Gloves,It's always Good to replace your gloves but this one runs very small and it hurts my hand. I Didn't realize that it was too small on started working out in them.
2,Great gloves.. Don't last,I love these gloves but they won't last. You'd be lucky to get a year out of them. I guess they are cheap enough to buy new ones every 7 months or so.
5,SUPER GLOVES - READ HERE,"I can guarantee you that whoever wrote badly about these gloves is Mr-Warm-Up-Your-Left-Hand himself and a lowly competitor of Harbinger in the glove market. What a phony. Amazon needs to find that jerk and pull his ad! That much is easy to see. I wear these gloves for 2 hours lifting weights, and my hands don't even begin to sweat. They fit fantastic. When you do wrist curls, you don't even notice that the gloves are on. They are that good. They have padding in between the layered, soft-leather palm. If your are bench pressing huge amounts, you might want to consider a Harbinger glove with a Pro rating as these are only rated intermediate -- still great gloves. They have a snug fit because the leather is spliced with small elastic areas, making them cool to wear due to the breathability."
4,Pretty good gloves,"I'm a gym rat and go through gloves every couple of months. Coming from a crappier Harbinger glove as my last pair, these are a much nicer improvement. They feel solid and well padded, yet flexible enough to not be annoying.I'm giving them 4 stars out of 5 for two reasons:1. They are a bit tight in the fingers, despite being a good fit for the rest of my hand. They shouldn't be making gloves for pansy fingers.2. The inside of the glove has a tag right at the bottom of the wrist, as well as a somewhat sharp edge around the wrist. Both issues can be eliminated or hammered out, but it's a bit annoying.Overall not bad, definitely worth a try."
5,Tough Gloves,"As it says, these are tough gloves, high quality construction, good fit, comfortable. I haven't worn them for too long yet, but so far so good."
4,Solid,"First, I should say that I've never worn another glove, so my opinion of the Harbinger 143s is not the result of comparative analysis. Several years ago when I first decided to use gloves for weight training, I bought these and they worked well, so I've stuck with 'em. My recent purchase is my third pair -- they hold up for a long time; in fact, my previous pair was still in good condition (purchased a few years ago) and I only bought an additional pair to switch up the color. Before the most recent purchase I looked into other gloves -- just to see what was out there -- but they all either seem insufficient or excessive. The Harbinger 143s are nothing fancy; they just get the job done without getting in the way."
5,Harbubger 143 wash and dry gloves,Fit perfectly.Gift for someone else. They loved them and said they worked well for his weight lifting. Protected his hands.Now he just has to go to the gym more often to wear them.
4,Good,I'm using those myself and just bought a couple as a gift. I use these gloves 3-4 times a week and they seem to be quite durable and comfortable. Recommend those
2,Gloves that don't fit me,"I'm only 5' 7"", 133 lb, a small guy. I ordered these men's gloves, size M. Size M arrived. Although they appear and feel nice, they are way too small for me. For decades, all size M gloves fit me fine, but not these. I gave them to my wife (they fit her)."
3,"Good Price, not so good Quality","Threads began unraveling after a months use. After the second to third month, they began to tear. Improve the quality and this item could easily get 5 stars."
4,"Good for price, but a bit small.","These are quality tough gloves. They don't have much padding, but are very sturdy. They are really tight right now and I don't have big hands, but I know they will loosen up as I break them in. This is (at least) my 3rd pair of Harbinger gloves over the years and I'm a big fan."
4,Harbinger gloves,"Theses gloves are simply wonderfull because they are durable, strong and....washable. It is amazing but I do not feel them hot during these last sunny days, very comfortable.I wish they could be little bigger for an XXL size"
5,Hooked!!,"I do weight training for the past 8 years and after trying many many gloves, this was the best I found. It's not too tick to make you uncomfortable and at the same time it totally protects your palm and fingers from getting blisters. I use it for mountain biking too, without any problem. Give it try, you'll love it."
3,Bought a lot of these over the years - quality is dropped,"EDITED THIS REVIEW.Left a review for this product a year or more ago, and since then got another set of gloves to replace a worn-out pair. The quality on these seems to be dropping. During my first workout I noticed a growing unfinished seam on one of the thumb areas, which I sewed that night. If I hadn't, the entire thumb portion of one glove would have unraveled. The next workout, the leather on the other glove separated from one of the main seams on the palm. Sewing this probably will not be productive.These are still likely the best workout gloves out there for the needs of many but I thought I'd let the Amazon community know the quality of the materials appears to have changed."
4,Workout Gloves,"The gloves are a little small, so I got a larger pair. The larger pair is the right size, but the fingers are a little long. This makes it a little discomfort when you squeeze a bar. But its minor. Not a big deal, but thats why I gave them a 4 instead of a 5. Other than that they are nice and good quality. Would recommend."
2,Not the best choice,The extra large pinches between my fingers. I don't have giant hands and have other harbingers that fit great.
1,do not purchase these.,the fit of these gloves is terrible. I measured like the instructions said and even ordered a size larger. I have large hands with xtra long fingers. these run so small that they cut into the webbing between my fingers and are very tight and painful to wear. so much so that I cannot use them. would not recommend these at all.
1,"DO NOT BUY, CUTS THE WEBBING OF YOUR HANDS","Another reviewer (By Cameron Scholtz Phoenix, AZ USA) who posted pictures got it right. He had to cut the webbing of the gloves. I'm not cutting anything of a brand new purchase. I returned them right away and bought the Harbinger Flexfit Training Gloves which are perfect.Do NOT Buy"
4,Excellent gloves,"Agree with other reviewers. Tough and durable, good padding. They could use a little more padding -- I do dips on a machine with unpadded grips, and sometimes feel the pressure on my palms, but these gloves do much better than alternatives that I have."
4,Glove Love,The Harbinger Pro FlexClosure gloves are a terrific addition to anyone's workout gear. I have problems with my hands and these gloves make a strong effort possible during my workouts. The fit is nearly perfect. They suggested I measure my hands before ordering. Good thing I did. I would never have ordered the Large gloves when in fact they were exactly what I needed. Well made and very comfortable!
4,Pretty good. I'd recommend them.,I use these whenever working out with my free weights. They definitely save your hands from blisters and a lot of other wear and tear. I'd recommend them.
4,so far pretty darn good,"Take the advise of the other reviewers seriously! Order one size larger! I did that and the XXL fits me snug. The padding is what I'd call medium - which is just what I wanted. You can easily close your hand around a weight bar but there is some decent cushioning. The only reasons I didn't give five stars are that the wrist strap can kind of distract and irritate just a little.Also, I have only had these for about a month and used them probably ten times. So I can't say how they'll hold up.... except that these replaced another pair of Harbingers that finally fell apart after about 5 years. That's pretty good for weight-lifting gloves that get used (and sweat in) a lot. I don't bother doing anything to take care of them either.These are soft leather and quite comfortable aside from the wrist thing I mentioned. They also feel sturdy which makes me think they will last five years like my last pair did."
4,Great Gloves,"The gloves are great. High quality, durable and comfortable. Even though I received XL when I ordered L,they do the job just fine. The $14 price tag is a bargain for the quality."
3,Just Okay,"These are not nearly as comfortable as the Valeo pair they replaced. I'm not talking about padding, it's just generally a less comfortable glove to wear. The shape of the glove forces your hand into a semi closed position. It takes more effort than usual to straighten your fingers or make a fist. The construction is pretty rough which again doesn't help the comfort thing. On the bright side, so far they're lasting well."
4,"Good gloves, especially once you break them in","These are very solid and snug fitting gloves. I really like them, and they seem well build. One thing to keep in mind is that the leather around the fingers is very strong and will take a while to be worked in. For the first few times of use, they will pinch your fingers, but eventually this will go away. I recommend these if you want to protect your hands from calluses."
4,Helps my hands,"Helps keep my hands from being scraped up. I am 6ft1, with thin and long fingers, and the large fits pretty well.Sometimes I still get a little scraping past where these gloves reach, but it is pretty minor."
4,I love these gloves,My second pair. Very comfortable. I like heavy duty leather gloves instead of the nylon. I hope they never stop making these gloves.
3,"Nice snug fit, good padding, really hard to remove...","Compared to the Harbinger 155's, these have more padding and seem to be better constructed. But the downside is, you'll have a helluva time removing them. I wear Medium's, and the 155's were easy to remove, but these are incredibly difficult to pry off your hands."
5,Glove size,"The gloves are exactly what I expected. I've always used weight room gloves and this pair is a GREAT fit. One minor problem though, the AMAZON site goes into every important question.....except one.......they don't ask for sizing info ! FITNESS GIANT had to email me for size."
5,Very pleased,"Initially I bought these with the intent of using them to replace my summer motorcycle gloves. I also lift weights to stay in reasonable shape. I find that these gloves are excellent for both motorcycle and weightlifting. Another Amazon review mentioned that you should buy these gloves in one size larger than you normally take...very true. Even the 1 size larger is snug. The gloves are nicely padded, fit and finish are excellent and they are high quality."
2,"Ummm, ok",I'm sorry but this book was just not worth buying. It was cool in some points but by Ch.5 I was ready to call it a wrap cause it was not good. I took my time with this one. It almost took me a month to read it and usually it takes me less than a week to read a book. So yeah don't waste your money if you want it go to a library and rent it.
1,give me a bucket!!!!!!!,please somebody tell me who wrote the editorial for his book. this was the worst book i have ever read in my life!!!!!!!!!!!! stupid story and stupid characters!!!!!!!! this writer should crawl under a rock and never come out again!!!!!!!!!!!! i want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Absolutely awful,I read 2 or 3 chapters of this book and could not take anymore. When I read a book I usually like to finish it but I could not do it with this one.I could not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Ghetto Girls,What a Good book. Its a book telling what really goes on in the ghetto.How gurls it raped and get in to drugs.
1,The only thing great is the cover,"This book looks like a good book, sounds like a good book, but thats about it. The slang was terrible, among other things the writer must not have written from experience beacasue the book sounds very artifical. Keep your money"
1,BORING!!!,"I've read enough books to know when a book is good and when a book just plain out sucks. I must say the cover was captivating, but being that the author was a man, I expected WAY more than what he gave. The girls in the story to me were not at all Ghetto. I say that this book had very good potential, if the title and plot was given to someone with the talent such as Ms. Souljah, the book would have been all that."
4,Keep reading this book!!,"I started and stopped this book many times because the first coouple of chapters were very slow. However, I persevered and decided one day that I was going to finish the story. And, I am so glad that I did!!My advice to everyone who reads the book is to finish it...see it all the way to the end because the characters come alive, the stories start to connect, and the drama begins to unfold.If you continue to read the book you will love it just as much as I did:-)!Today I rushed out to but Ghetto Girls Too couldn't wait to continue the story of Da Crew!!"
1,I don't think so.....,"I really think this book was bad. If you're from the hood you'll know from the first two chapters that Anthony Whyte is not from the hood. The slang was just totally unbelievable. I was really upset that I had purchase the book. I think the book talks more about Lil Long n' Vulcha then the so called ghetto girls. And what made them so ghetto? Was it the fact that they used the word ""YO"" fifty million times in one sentence or becuase they smoked weed. What ever it is I don't know but this book was not worth it at all. I really don't think Mr. Whyte has what it takes to be an author. The reason he got 1 star from me was because I gave him credit for the catchy title. Honestly though, this book has nothing to do with ghetto girls. The characters, the slang, and the story just didn't fit."
2,Ghet-not....,"This book had an interesting title, and I thought that it would be hard core from a woman's point of view. In reading this book I was thrown, it tells the story from so many angles with so many plots, it was a little toooooo far fetched at times. It was too imaginary with too much going on. The ending was like HOW THAT HAPPEN? {Although it was obvious!} Maybe in part 2 it'll form into something better."
3,Tales From The Hood,"Good stuff. Anthony Whyte blesses a fairly large group of girls all distinct, and the supportitng cats is serious as well. Thy're all so real. Ha ha-Ant's my peeps-got copies of the whole series signed from him-Keep our eyes peeled for Survivalist by Blaine Martin. You gotta love creative folk.For some reason, I always picture Eric Ascot to be played by Ced the Entertainer if Ghetto Girls was adapted for a film.I gave it three stars because Parts II and III really step it up."
1,Ghetto Girls,This book was horrible the thing that made me get this book was the picture on the cover. It looked like it was going to be real good but I was let down big down.There was too many stuff going on in too many different directions.Nothing was completed everything was just jumping from next drama to the next. It was so confusing that after the fifth chapter I just put the book to rest.I even let two of my cousins read the book and they also struggled with it.
1,Ghetto Girl,IF THIS BOOK WASNT THE LAMEST....IM GALD I BORROW IT BEFORE I WASTED MY MONEY BUYING IT.....
2,WACK,"THis book...well lets just say this book didn't move me at all, see when doing a street novel majority of your target audience is people in the streets. But then you have your readers (I'm a true found reader)so we(T.F.R) look for everything and try to put everything together. This book I trully didn't like, I brought it because when I decided to publish my book(So Look Out), people will supprot me, but there more to it.I want to support Black Print publishing. This didn't represent it at all, it makes the other good author's look bad, yet I've Mr. Whyte mad respect for doing his thing. But I'll support his new book when it comes out, for I hope will be ten times better."
2,Practical but...,"Great concept but for anyone looking to print quantity and quickly, this is not for you, especially with graphics. It's just too slow. But at it's torpid speed it still manges to work well."
1,what a disappointment,"I ordered this Bluetooth adaptor because we recently went wireless and, once we got our 2nd computer, we needed a wireless all-in-one printer. The concept of Bluetooth is good but the reality is very disappointing. I didn't realize that the adaptor didn't work with the scanner. Okay, I was willing to make adjustments when I wanted to scan. However, the range of the Bluetooth adaptor is very short. It worked when I was in the same room as the printer but not when I went across the hall. Apparently, Bluetooth doesn't work through walls. Instead, I was able to hook up both computer to the printer via ""shared printer"" mode. I can't imagine why anyone would want this $50 item."
2,An overpriced little gadget...,"Instead of buying this, just buy an AluraTek Bluetooth adapter. I picked up three for $9.99 on Ebay and it has plug and play functionality. Just like the other users, though, I can only print wirelessly. Scanning and copying must be done via USB.I have a Canon MP610 and a MacBook Pro 17"" running OSX 10.5 (Leopard)"
3,upgrade to BU-30 instead,"In Feb 2010 the BU-20 is obsolete, so get the new BU-30.I bought an ip100 mobile printer (excellent printer), and Bu-30 is the most current Bluetooth part for it, and it's the same price $49 or less."
1,Inaccurate product description,"As this product is being offered for remote operation of a multifunctional machine, a more specific description of it's function should be given.Bluetooth only is good to operate the printer and unable to run the other functions of the machine (scanner)."
5,"so little, so wonderful","we have a pc at home and my husband just got me a MAC. I turn the bluetooth on in my MAC, send it to print and tarararara!!!!! it's done. great for illiterate computer people like me. Just plug it and it's done!"
1,Total waste of money,"This adapter is very expensive for a device that gives you blind print dump features only. This adapter does not support scanning, faxing, or even the most basic features such as printing/er status and ink levels. Documents printed with this will print but printer/ink status and every other function will yield an error. After speaking with canon tech support about the bluetooth ""Hardcopy Cable Replacement"" which states it will support all of the same features as if it were connected via a cable they confirmed that none of that is true and the ONLY function this adapter will support is direct to port printing."
1,BU-20 and other options,"I have noticed a lot of confusion online and no clear explanation of this simple question: Will ANY bluetooth dongle work in place of the Canon BU-20 Bluetooth Adapter in a Canon printer? The answer is YES. The cost of the BU-20 is rather exorbitant and a simple $8.99 Class 1 Bluetooth Adapter will work perfectly fine. The only issue you may run in to is fitting the adapter in the usb slot. On my PiXMA MP470 the front usb port is recessed and the adapter I purchased did not fit on its own. However the adapter I purchased came with a small usb extension cable which easily solved the problem. So, unless you're willing to shell out for the aesthetics of the BU-20, I recommend any bluetooth adapter in its place."
3,Blue in the Tooth,"The adapter works for printing only on a canon MP950, but not for scanning. The canon printer documentation does not make this lack explicit. It simply talks only of printing.Maybe Canon could have spent an extra penny to make it clearer that you can only print on your $450 printer after spending an additional $80 for the adapter.At least, you know now."
1,There are alternatives,Any Class I bluetooth adapter would work in its place! The only thing to keep in mind is that the adapter that you should get one that has a USB extension cord in order to let it fit into the small port on the printer. Please dont buy this and waste money. I have a $8.00 bluetooth adapter that works great! Enjoy your printer :)PS. I am using it with MP460 and my comp is running Vista Ultimate. I have installed the vista compatible drivers for MP460 that I got from the canon's website (European).
2,BU-20 OK for Text Printing from Macintosh,"Easy to set up and use, but VERY slow printing. Don't plan to use this for graphics, but for occasional printing of text files it works fine. I had hoped it would allow me to avoid using my desktop Mac as a print server (via wireless network connection) when printing from my laptop. Alas, when I need to print large files (eg, photos, or 17 pages of TurboTax output) I take my laptop to the printer and plug-in USB direct.I suppose I could start print jobs just before going to bed...."
3,You probably don't need this,"This product works fine for what is intended, that is, printing wirelessly.The range is somewhat limited because it is bluetooth, not wifi, and you cannot scan to your computer, but neither can you do so with many wireless print servers. What canon doesn't tell you, of course, is that this adapter doesn't offer any additional functionality over any bluetooth dongle off-the-shelf. At least that's the case for my mp610 AIO. I use an aluratek abd2020, and everything works fine right out of the package. Just follow canon's instructions for bluetooth in the onscreen manual and GO! Save your money and try any usb bluetooth adapter for $10-$20 or so (might want to see that it has an extension cradle in case you want to move it around to improve range)."
3,Other USB bluetooth adapters work,"This product works fine, however it's very expensive and I discovered other USB bluetooth adapters work fine also, though some others don't work (Kensington did work with my Pixma mp610 printer). So you can save some dough."
2,Canon BU-20 Adapter,The Canon BU-20 works fine but I noticed when I installed it on my Canon MP960 printer it slowed down some when it prints. My printer was much faster when I was using a USB cord.
2,mediocre,"This adaptor has poor range, and it takes a long time to print most things. Not really worth the money."
4,Very Practical!,"Handy little gadget. Wish the range was a tad bit more, but not having to always mess with wires & switching back & forth from different computers is really nice!"
2,"Great idea, not so good implementation","Tried this, didn't work out so well. I couldn't find the correct drivers for the bluetooth adapter, and they didn't make it very easy to link into my mac. I've also read that data only goes one way (to the printer, not back), so it sort of makes it not as useful. Great idea, but poor implementation"
3,Disappointed,"I bought this item to use my lap top to send print data to my Canon iP6700D printer wireless. In the next room, it takes 6 or 7 minutes to print one page. While sitting next to the printer, it loses half the data from the document I want to print. Bluetooth is not that big a deal!"
5,Great product,Hooked it up to my printer and I am now wireless! Great alternative to buying a wireless printer!
1,painting by the numbers (and the numb),"The first rule of storytelling (one that too many films of the 1970s-1990s ignored) is that an interesting or suspenseful plot requires characters with whom one may sympathize. THE ART OF MURDER fails this test, as it trots out a hoary adultery/ murder set-up and then drags its feet through every convention associated with such melodramas.I bought THE ART OF MURDER because Michael Moriarity has appeared in so few products after he walked off LAW AND ORDER. His voice in this more recent effort suggests perhaps a bout of throat surgery. While it is understandable to want to play against type, his loutish alcoholic tycoon is beyond his (or our) grasp.And the title of the movie refers to a plot detail too arbitrary to merit attention."
3,"OK, but a bit obvious...","It's an OK book for a complete novice, but a lot of the information is kind of obvious, and there's a lot of over-explaning things that most people can figure out for themselves, and don't really need to be told. I found it wordy; providing scientific names in parenthesis was unnecessary, or just nerdy, or showing off or something. That was annoying to me. Others might like that. Also, there's too many irrelevant statistics, but it's an okay introduction to bass fishing, albeit not a very inspired one."
3,dissapointed,"when i got this book i was so excited. but when i read it, i wasn't impressed. the book didnt help me and i knew all of the stuff already. it doesnt really help u locate bass it just tells the different types of cover. if i were u i would buy the freshwater angler book on largemouth bass, now thats a good book!"
4,Invicta Men's Automatic Pro Diver G3 Watch #8931,"Build quality is not quite as good as the 8926 I bought a month before purchasing this one. It is certainly a great value. Keeps fairly good time. Out of the box, it gains about 18-20 seconds per day.Would I buy another one? Yes, if I needed it."
5,Hard to single out any one composer,"Besides the incomparable John Tavener, Sir Charles Villiers Stanford's ""For Lo, I raise up"", Sir William Harris's ""Strengthen ye the weak hands"", Sir C Hubert H. Parry's ""My soul, there is a country'"", are memorable."
5,A good product with many uses,"I purchased mine shortly after buying the lot for my house, to pull saplings and bushes: worked like a charm. Built a garage, and used it to un-rack the frame -- squaring the building. Got my utility trailer stuck in the mud, and used this to pull it out. Snow-thrower died, and I used this to winch it on my utility trailer to take for repairs. Not too bulky, heavy, or expensive -- it sure has bailed me out enough to be one of the last tools I'd ever wish to be without. Highly recommended!george"
2,Broke while removing a yew bush,"I had to return this item after it broke while I was using it to remove a yew bush. I know that yew bushes have deep roots that can be pretty stubborn, but it is hard for me to believe that yanking out a bush exceeded the 2-ton capacity."
1,awkward,"lowering this thing is not easy, instructions are very poor. it doesn't lift things as heavy as it claims. the flat metal in the Y of the handle which switches it from up to down is a poor design. mine bent out of shape with a finger push (twisted and popped out of the end). this thing will rip your hands up too if you're not careful.beware of the clear Amazon propaganda on this too. too many 5 star reviews with similar comments to be believable."
4,Great product! American made was the selling point for this item.,"Overall I am impressed with the product. I'm still learning how to use it, but have found difficulty in getting the thing to reverse directions. Previous come-a-longs I've owned had a switch that allowed you to work the tool in rverse to take the pressure off. This one may do the same, but we haven't seen how. Very strong and durable product though."
5,Truly remarkable!,"This could possibly be the best terrible movie ever. The acting is... stunning, the plot and writing are laughable, and the props... oh my, the props... Imagine, for a moment, the glory of special forces riding around a lake in neon jet skis shooting fireworks off them. Apparently they were using the Las Vegas camouflage scheme. This movie was good for many a hearty laugh, and I'm disappointed that it's not for sale as a DVD."
3,fair,Slow moving.Liked Kraft as a villain. Had humor but could've been more vicious.Frank Zagorino stiff as usual and not a character worth rooting for. Very scary to think how easy it is to get one's hands on a missle.
1,Disappointed,"The scale is already broken. It just reads ""Lo"" when you step on it, and I just got it a couple of weeks ago. It worked for about a week and a half!"
4,Tun Huang,"This is a great book and shows the depth of Inoue's imagination. It is based upon the Buddhist Scriptures found in Tun Huang, a part of the silk road path. Inoue tells the story of how these scriptures were placed there in the first place. The story has very little to do with Buddhism or religion. It is more of an adventure novel with a scholar as its hero. Well written and evenly paced, it takes the reader back to a time when there were magnificent battles in Asia. After you read this book, rent the video. Unfortunately, the American version of the video is chopped up so that the story is not really comprehensible. However, if you've read the book, you may be able to appreciate the movie a little better."
4,Fascinating work of historical fiction,"A deep, moving work about an area of history unknown to me. An 11th century Chinese academic risks life and limb on the borders of the Chinese Empire out of curiousity about an enemy's language. His adventures as a soldier, scholar and lover of a Uighur princess are all a prelude to his acceptance of Buddhism.His gift to history (the historic basis for the novel) is hiding thousands of rare Buddhist Sutras in the caves at Tun-Huang, where they were to reside for more than 9 centuries. Their discovery helped scholars to understand not only early Buddhism but also language and history from a forgotten era.The translation is a bit stilted (a normal feature with Asian translations, I find) but the story comes through. Well worth reading, both as a story of adventure and devotion as well as for the historical context."
3,Dry as the desert sand,"As historical fiction goes, Tun-Huang left me as parched as the cache of dry and dusty scrolls that are the featured subplot of the novel. Yasushi Inoue's even and factual narration seems best suited to history, less to fiction. While the story possesses a sharply etched clarity, the author falls short in applying this to his characters. They are drawn with a lean hand and lack human warmth and dimension. Their remoteness makes it difficult to believe that they are sufficiently motivated to act as they do or to feel what they feel. The translator's English is stiff and formal, often resulting in stilted, artificial dialogue. It was a quick read, but I was disappointed that such a well-received book could seem so immediate and yet lacking in life."
2,Need to balance other reviews,"This movie might -- might -- deserve 3 stars, but with the other two 5-star ratings, I feel the need to add a dose of reality.This is a poorly acted, loosely constructed teen movie with a trial at the center. Even the trial proceedings are so counter to what a real trial is like -- thanks to modern legal drama and jury duty, I have some familiarity with what lawyers really do in a courtroom -- that it doesn't add any balance to the film.If you're nostalgic for the fashions and the hairstyles and the wooden writing of the 80s, this film is for you. For my part, I'd recommend a remake."
1,I am sure the product will be just as rotten as the seller,I wont be able to use this product because I wont be in my city for a while when it arrives. THE SELLER DID NOT CANCEL THE ORDER WHEN i asked and amazon did nothing about it. Chandu A. and the other customer service agents who emailed me can go to He*l. :)
5,Amazing book!,This is an incredible book and I highly recommend this to anyone that has a desire to learn more about serious Shark Attacks. It is simply amazing and highly informative!. The author was so kind to have inscribed the inside of the book for my husband as it was a gift. It will be cherished for years to come! A must read!
1,Disappointed,"The service from Choosey Shopper was very good. The belt came from the USA very quickly and they did refund the cost in full but not the cost of returning it, although I did tell them how much it had cost to post it back. I was disappointed because they asked what size I required and then didn't take any notice of my request. It was far too long and when I enquired locally as to how much it would cost to have it made smaller it was almost as much as the cost of the belt. I suppose I should have realised from the orignial cost that the quality wouldn't be very good but it was very cheap and nasty. The back of the belt definitely wasn't leather and the whole thing had a very suspicious plastic smell. The buckle was very wobbly as well. Very disappointing."
2,first order gone wrong,ordered a belt with specified size and received belt that is inches too long from what i ordered. just dissapointing - does nobody pay attention to detail?
5,An awesome marketing book that will make you money,"This is a must-have for the person who craves making big money. While there are many excellent marketing books, there are few people with as much know-how as the author. If you want to make money and discover some little-known marketing methods, you need this book.Highly recommended.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
5,An inspiring philosophy of mind for the new mellinium,"George Pransky tells us that, instead of focusing on the problems of our lives and learning new ways to solve them, we can shift our focus to the processes of our mind that underly and perpetuate the problems. He teaches us about the nature of thought and different kinds of thinking, about how our lack of understanding of how the mind works and how our thinking influences and frequently blocks our natural underlying mental health. This is a practical psychology that has a spiritual basis--an understanding of what Buddhist would call causality. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for new insight for improving his/her psychological and spiritual life."
5,Excellent Resource,This is a wonderful resource for 3 Principles information. Anyone can read and enjoy this book. I am not a professional psychology trained individual but the 3 Principle information in this book is excellent. I read this book before I purchased it and then HAD to buy my own copy for my library. I know that I have had insights after reading this book. Anyone intersted in learning more about the Three Principles should definitely consider this book.
1,Different Cruiser for the promotion,"I went to toys r us and saw the promotion there. I never saw the Rockin' Bratz Criser as part of the promotion. However the cruiser that is offered is very nice as well, It comes in Black or Silver with a real working fm radio. I love this and it has a remote control to really drive your Bratz around. I don't see one here with this???? I would buy it as prt of the collection but I believe my daughter will enjoy the one I recv'd with promotion better. By the way moms, going on until 12/7/2005 at stores. Better Hurry!"
1,Car is falling apart!,"We've had this car for only 2 months and it is falling apart. The trunk latch is broken, doors and seat backs fall off, and bumper is falling off. The ""radio"" only picks up the first radio station it scans - usually static. Very disappointing!"
2,Parts fall off easily,"The doors, hood and trunk are hinged so you can open and close them. However, when my daughter would just be pushing it along she would loose a door. I thought it was because she didn't reconnect the hinges correctly but even when I fixed it - parts would fall off.I do like the working radio in the car and so did my daughter was was 7 when I got it for her.After the parts falling off so many times she took off both doors, the hood and trunk and played without them. The car looked like it was at a chop-shop and the dolls fell out from time-to-time, but she had fun."
3,NOT FUN AT ALL,I had this toy and the pieces kept falling apart.This toy only fits TWO bratz dolls .This toy is a scam!If you are a bratz fan' dont buy this toy!
5,One great book a must read for all Christians,Need I say more! The man's perception into real life is a blessing. The prayer at the end of each chapter I use daily
1,jacked up workbook.....!!!,"This book was in the most f***ed up condition ever!! It was written in with MARKER! Usually if your planning on selling a workbook at the end of the semester you write in it with pencil so that it's easy to erase and reuse. This person didn't do that, and didn't mention the entire book was written in with marker. Sure i could have sent it back, but the semester had already started and i expected to get a book in acceptable conditions....this is by no means acceptable!! Do not buy from this person!! It's false advertisement!!"
3,Not as advertized,The title is shown is not in English but English is listed as the language. It is not. I bought books for my grandchildren and now I need to reorder. I am not disappointed in the book but in Amazon's inability to get the facts correct.
1,Screaming baby!,"My baby isn't normally sensitive, but screamed when I put this on her. I washed it off and put on triple paste with a fleece liner and she was fine. Never will use this again. Calming? Not likely!"
1,SCREAMING baby,"Like others have said, I applied this and my son was IMMEDIATELY hysterically screaming and clawing at himself until I thoroughly wiped it off. What a waste of money and a horrible product!"
2,Didn't work for yeast rash,"My son's yeast rash got worse when we tried this cream. Before that we'd simply been using Burt's Bees diaper cream on it, which is not anti-fungal, yet seemed to do a better job. The consistency is also more watery than the Burt's Bees, so I'm not even sure I really liked it as a diaper cream. Disappointing. I'd save your money and buy something else."
1,My little man cried too!,"Applied this so called ""calming"" cream to my baby's bum and he cried frantically each time! I thought it might be because his diaper rash was so bad but when I applied the triple paste cream he had no reaction to it. I definitlely would not recommend this product for any baby unless you want your child to be in pain!"
2,thought this would be a great hand cream,"It has similar ingredients to Awakening Hands and is less expensive. However, it is not a moisturizer, it is very drying. It turned my hands white. I suppose it would make sense that this is a diaper cream when applied to a thoroughly cleansed diaper rash. It works good as a foot ointment."
1,Made my baby scream in pain for 5 whole minutes,"Truly awful. My poor 11 months baby screamed in pain! I called customer service and someone asked me to email her the batch number so she could look at it. She never followed up on my email. If you want all natural, I would recommend Boudreau's butt paste or Burt bees. They work wonders even if they don't smell as nice..."
5,Wonder Cream!,"I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 6 wk old who both have sensitive skin. Our daughter uses their sunscreen since she is allergic to most all chemical sunscreens on the market. I thought I would try their diaper rash cream on my 6 wk old son when he developed a diaper rash and Desatin was seeming to make it worse. Using the cream in coordination with their Diaper Area Wash (I ceased using commercial diaper wipes when I noticed the rash), the rash was GONE in less than 18 hours. I noticed a marked difference after just 1 diaper change with decreased redness, inflammation and sensitivity. I would HIGHLY recommend this and other products made by California Baby. As a perk, the diaper products have a soothing, pleasant scent as well."
4,Great for sensitive skin,This cream is great for irritated or sensitive skin - gentle enough for everyday use. I love how easily it can be applied and that a tiny bit goes a long way.
5,Great for cloth diapers!,This diaper rash cream works great for cloth diapers and a little bit goes a long way. I also use the California baby diaper area wash. Both are very calming!
1,Beware,"Love California baby products. However, this product burns baby. Just thought I'd warn other parents out there. I have used this in the past on my other children whose rashes weren't as bad. My poor newborn was in serious pain from this so maybe they changed their formula? Should contain a warning label. I'm off to buy some of my trusty old Triple Paste!"
2,Caused my baby to cry when he had a diaper rash,"I had high hopes for this product, as I am a big fan of the California Baby bath soap for babies. Unfortunately, I put this on my little toddler's bottom when he had a rash and he screamed and tried to get away from me. I felt so terrible. I thought perhaps I had been too rough applying it (rather than that the product actually caused him discomfort), so I tried it again another night before bedtime when he had a rash, with the same response. Tonight I put it on him with no rash, and he definitely seemed uncomfortable. We will go back to using the Burt's Bees diaper rash ointment as we have not had any problems with it."
3,Diaper rash prevention,"My son is cloth diapered, and we have used this product as a preventative to diaper rash during the night because it washes out of the cloth diapers well and does not impact their absorbancy. Smells nice too. During a recent move out of state, we had to use disposable diapers during our relocation process. My son immediately got a diaper rash due to his sensitivity to the disposable absorbants and such. When I used this on the already appearing diaper rash, it was very painful for him. It was apparent the cream was stinging the red skin. So I found that this is a great product for preventing diaper rash, but if you've already got a case of it, you might want to try something else for relief."
5,Amazing!,"I love this diaper rash cream! It cleared my daughter's diaper rash up in less than 24 hours! She has had diaper rash before but not for days like this time. I am amazed at how well this works! We cloth diaper, and this is safe for them, too."
1,Painful for Rashes,"This diaper cream seems ok as a preventative application when my baby does not have a rash, but when she already has a rash and I apply this cream she immediately starts crying in pain! If I can't use it to treat a diaper rash, it's not much good. I'm not sure what ingredient would cause this stinging pain, possibly the tea tree? I won't be buying this again."
1,BURNED HIS SKIN OFF,I usually love California Baby but this product BURNED my son's skin off. I had to wipe it off immediately. I had never heard him scream the way he did when I applied this cream. His skin blistered and actually peeled off. It created the worst rash I've ever seen. I will never buy this product again.
3,Only good for mild rash,"My 7 month old son has had mild diaper rashes in the past where we used this product and it was great (since he was born). However, he now has his first major diaper rash (probably because he is on antibiotics for the first time) and this product has caused him pain. He actually had tried to escape from his own pain when I applied this ointment on his little red tush. I felt so bad. I liked it for mild redness, but I think with this heavier rash, it could actually cause pain."
4,Too bad it wasn't finished,"What an enchanting recording. Briseis, an unfinished opera by Emmanuel Chabrier is here given a dream performance by all involved. This disc made me an admirer of the Chorus of Scottish Opera, Joan Rodgers and the Hyperion record label.Mrs. Rodgers (Briseis) sings ravishingly from beginning to end on his disc. You can feel true trepidation and love in her voice. Her lover (Hylas), sung by Mark Padmore also gives a worthy performance.The high point of this recording is the excellent singing of the Chorus of Scottish Opera. Setting a pointed backdrop to the action of the tale, this is singing like I have rarely heard elsewhere. Full of beauty and an almost otherworldly presence.The recording qualities are, as with all Hyperion releases, first rate. It is a wonderfully spacious sound without being too close.Hyperion is always dependable when it comes to finding gems others have overlooked. This is one of those gems. Buy it."
3,Folk sounds,"So, I saw these guys play at a Renaissance festival b/c I'm a dork but I really liked their sound so I bought the CD there. I was hoping to find more of their stuff on amazon.com because I really like this album. It is a blend/compilation of several styles of folk music, most of which I suppose is Slavic (don't quote me on this). Regardless, the musicianship is great and the tunes are easy to listen to. I'd recommend to anyone!UPDATESorry, had to drop the rating after hearing the violin again... Everything else sounds great--really, the guitar is amazing, but beware the songs heavy with violin!"
5,Exotic & sweet.,"ENG: This CD have exotic y sweet music, that use exotic scales from the Middle East.ESP: Este CD tiene música exótica y dulce, que utiliza escalas exóticas del Oriente Medio."
4,Awesome picture quality,"I bought this camcorder few days back and this is one buy that iam not going to regret. In spite of some of the drawbacks, seeing yourself in HD gives you real high. The picture quality is awesome. Its like stack of 5-6 mega pixel images put together. I have infact paused the video at few places and taken screenshots of them.Lack of video editing tools is a drawback. Sony provides tools to convert H.264 to Mpeg. So that I can use the Mpeg files on Sony Vegas. Audio quality is excellent. Great camcorder when shooting outdoors. Night time shooting needs improvement. Can spot lot of noise in the video when shooting in dark.I would recommend to buy a RW disk and dump all its contents to your computer, then erase the DVD contents."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"The videos look great. The night vision works very well. But good luck trying to convert Sony's proprietary video format to use it on ANYTHING ELSE. You cannot even load the videos to YouTube without paying for extra, third-party software. Thanks, Sony, for cheating me out of good money. Never, never, never buy this stupid camcorder."
1,Not compatible with MacIntosh computers!,"I bought a MacBook Pro computer specifically to edit my home videos, due to its ease of use and compatbility with a wide variety of cameras. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that while I can get stills from this camera onto my Mac, the video is incompatible! To even read the documentation on the included CD I had to borrow a PC. I don't know if a driver will ever be available to let me use the Mac with the videos from this camera.As far as its quality as a video camera, the price is right and it is fine for my use, although heavy and with short recording time."
2,This is not a good one to buy!!!,"The worst thing for this is, you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing HD video. I think most of buyers would take HD video if you buy a HD camcorder. But a small disc can only hold 20 min HD video, have to change disc time by time. The CMOS sensor is worse than CCD but it is the best sensor among CMOS in this price today. A lot of noise will come in low light condition! I bought it for $800 and return it. I think you'd better buy SR1 with a 30G hard drive. That would be a much better one!"
4,Worth a look,David Drake's old Nathan alone is worth the price of this book in my humble opinion and Diamonds was a good read also.
5,Great size!,Nice big sized for cookies. Easy to clean and easy to store. Would definitely recommend this cookie cutter and would buy again!
5,Snowman Cookie Cutter,Delivery was timely (especially since the holiday season had begun) and the product great. I have boththe Snowman and Icicle cookie cutters and absolutely love the cushioned comfort grip and size of the cookie(or other product) when cut out. A number of my earlier cookie cutters cut out relatively small cookiesmaking for more difficult decorating. AND the cookie recipe included with each cutter are really decentones.
1,Out of Focus,"If you are into photos that are hard to see and blurry images, this is the book for you. When they say out of focus, take it literally. My book is new, and will definetely be for sale ASAP. Don't waste time or money unless you want to feel like you have coke bottle glasses on. Leave this one alone."
4,Dylan Thomas reading his poetry,"Excellent 2 audio-cassette recording of all the major, and some minor, Dylan Thomas poems including 'Fern Hill', 'Poem in October', 'Do not go gentle' etc. My favourites are 'Over Sir John's Hill', 'Hunchback in the Park', 'On the marriage of a virgin', 'Light breaks where no sun shines' - all on these tapes. I was hoping that the recording would include Thomas' famous introduction to poetry called 'A few words of a kind' but sadly that is not on these tapes."
1,Hollow mainstream Jazz,I wonder why Murray produced this album. It is in no way up to his mark. Hollow mainstream Jazz like any nightclub combo plays.
4,I Almost Loved It!,"After attending a seminar where Carol Frank was a guest speaker, I purchased the book. While it has many good examples of business mistakes, I thought she could have gone a little more in depth when it came to the solutions of the problems. My other minor complaint is that she focused on too many local businesses from her home state of Texas, and not enough on national companies. Overall, it was a good book, though not one I'd likely read a second time."
5,I learned a lot!,"This book will help anyone that is running a business, whether a for-profit or (as in my case) a non-profit! I learned a lot from this book about what I was doing correctly and what I needed to change and/or beware of. This book also reinforced the changes I had made to my business were in the best interest of my business."
4,FASCINATING STORIES,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and --being an entrepreneur myself--have gotten great tips on what to avoid! But the best part is how entertaing the stories are and how humorously written. I highly recommend it!
4,Review,I bought this book for my Software System Architecture Class..Book has good examples and explanation is very clear and understandable..Hope it works for me in future..:)
3,Icing on the NOLF cake,"Although mostly fun, this game feels like it never really went as far as it could have. If it had been developed more deeply, it could have really been fun. Maybe the energy should have been spent on developing the next NOLF game? If you're curious, by all means, go for it. It was a fun game, but left me feeling as if something (or someone - Cate Archer) was missing."
2,Fun but too short and shallow,"Meant as a ""mid-quel"" connecting ""No onelives forever"" to NOLF 2, this stand-alone expansion returns you to the cheeky world of stylish superspies and comical mega-villains.Your death-dealing skills are put to use in an underground Siberian base, a lunar installation, a rocket ship, and an Italian town complete with medieval fort. But while the environments are up to par, the opposition is very unimpressive. On each level, all the baddies look, fight, and die the same. The complete lack of diversity among your adversaries makes for monotony.I kept on wondering when the game would pick up, and it just never did. Contract J.A.C.K. could be completed in one sitting, clocking in at just over five hours."
3,The unknown villian Cate never got a chance to meet,"As the final installement to the Nolf series, Contract Jack comes as a bit of a disappointment. Not only is the game too short to be really any fun, but the kill off the prime character way to easily. He's the best contract killer for heavens sake! Surely his death should have been at the hands of the one and only spy: Cate Archer.Graphics are good, not so that you need an alienware to run it, but decent enough to truly be enjoyable without having the computer lock up even on the highest options. So for those of us that don't have hundreds to spend on new computers and graphics card, you would not be amiss in trying out this game."
4,Contract Jack,"Bought this game AND NOLF 2 ... actually had more fun with THIS game! Item just as described, fast shipping!"
