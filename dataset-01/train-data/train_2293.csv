4,Well worth the money.,"I bought 2 of these for my kids at Xmas. They are 10 & 16 yrs old. We felt the Ipod or Nano was too expensive and since you could add memory to this one, it was perfect. It's very small & compact. Bring anywhere.The program was easy to use & the songs are easy to download on to the unit. If any downfall, the sound quality could be a little better. But over all this is a great unit. My kids love it. Great buy. I'm sure we will add on memory in time."
5,Great Player !!!,"This MP3 player is excellent. Very ligth in weight, easy to use, you just drag and drop the files properly labeled in to the player (like a pen drive)and it organizes them for you. The radio feature is very good and the menus very intuitive. You can also expand the memory up to 3 GB and use it like a regular pen drive; these features add value to the player compared with other brands. The only thing I don't like very much is the armband, specially when you work out in the gym, but I've overcome this issue using a belt clip holder of a regular cellphone, much more confortable for me...Overall, I recommend this player as an excellent product!!"
3,"Nice, portable, great for workouts","If you're looking for a rugged little mp3 player to take to the gym, the Sansa is a good choice. I didn't want to drop hundreds on an mp3 player that I wouldn't use all over - I just wanted something that was small, durable, and expandable (which is a great feature if you have other things that run on SD cards - like a Treo phone). If you want to build an accessories collection around your mp3 player for your car, your home theater, etc - the iPod may be a better pick, but for the money - the SanDisk fills its niche perfectly and completely."
4,Happy with purchase,"This was worth the money. I cannot see spending too much money on an MP3 player, so this one was perfect. Yeah, 1GB isn't a lot of room, but at least additional memory cards can be bought for this MP3 player if you desire. The only bad thing is that the USB cord is too darn short (only about 6 inces long) and my USB 2.0 port is in the back of my computer under my desk so it's not easy to plug in with such a short cord. The company really needs to include a longer cord! But, I'm still happy with my purchase."
3,"good capacity, difficult buttons","holds an awesome amount of music and sound quality is great if you can keep the volume at a continuous level. A simple bump and the volume drops, and you have to continuously turn the volume knob to get it to go back up!!! Very difficult when using in a vehicle! Not to mention you have to press the other buttons numerous times before they work. 50/50 good and bad"
2,Let down,"I bought this to play audiobooks using Microsoft DRM. Unmentioned in any description is the fact that there is no bookmarking function. Thus you have to start the book at the beginning everytime, and with books lasting several hours, this is completely impractical.It is cheap looking, and the USB-in plug cover is cheap and unattached - it will be lost very quickly. Documentation is sparse, but functionality is pretty good, as is sound quality."
1,Stopped working after 1 week of use,"I am afraid I was one of those who said ""it will not happen to me"", but it did :( I did saw some other mentions of product stopped working after a while, but somehow, believed this will be rare, and will not happen to me.After about 1 week of very light use (still with the original battery!), the Sansa stopped working: it will not power on. It is not the battery, and not the extrenal SanDisk 1GB SD I placed; the Sansa just does not startup.While working, the product was OK: feels a bit flimsy, but I thought ""what can you expect from a low priced unit"". I was wrong. Not only feels flimsy, but also functions as one!The Sansa will be returned for a refund, and I am on the lookout for a better product; no, it is not going to be iPod, as I have many WMAs, but will surely not be yet another SanDisk product!"
4,mp3 player,"The sound is very acceptable. Battery duration is 12 hours approximately, not 17 as you say. Generally a very good mp3 player."
3,Good product in general,I think this product is good in general. It has a lot of memory so you can listen to a lot of songs. You can also use it to save data from your computer. Two things I don't like.The headphones are not the most comfortable. They are the ones that you put inside your ears and I don't like this kind of headphones very much. The other thing is the quality of the sound. It is not very good. I have another digital audio player from sony and the sound in this one is great. When you compare one with the other you get dissapointed. I really wish that the quality of sound was much much better.
2,This MP3 Player is O.K.,"I bought this MP3 Player thinking it would be really great but it turned out to be not as great as I thought it would be.Things I like:~It is small and easy to carry with you wherever you go.~The earphones are nice and comfortable.~It looks very cool.~It comes with a carrying case and a thing to carry it on your arm.Things I didn't like:~One time I turned the volume up just a little and it blasted so loud that it hurt my ears.~When you pull of the squishy things on the earphones to clean them, sometimes the earphones fall apart and you have to push them back together.~The worst thing about it is that it is horrible at sorting the music. I put on lots of different songs by different artists and it screwed almost all of it up. Songs were not put in the right albums and tons of other thing s were totally not right. You can fix it almost all the way if you have enough time.I might reccomend this to someone only if if they have a lot of time and patience to work with it."
2,Crummy instructions.,"Does not bookmark your spot where you left off. I listen to audio books and need to be able to start up where i left off. When you shut it off you loss your place. The instructions are worthless. I got a Samsung YEPP-ptm-6z, It has better instructions and a ""resume"" that lets you bookmark your spot. It kept freezing up on me. I took it back after 3 days of frustration."
4,"Good, good... Good...","It's great, I'm happy with it. Delivery was fast. I didn't realize it was refurb, but that doesn't really matter anyway. Good product."
4,Owner's Manual is Insufficient,"I purchased this MP3 player about a month ago and overall I have been happy with it. One huge flaw in the product however is in the lack of information provided in the owner's manual. I used the player for a few days when it suddenly stopped working. I assumed it needed new batteries. After replacing the batteries, however, the player still didn't work. I was very disappointed in the device at this point and saw no reason for it to just stop working. We contacted the manufacturer and they told us that you have to take the dead batteries out of the device for 2-5 mins. before replacing with new batteries. I was instructed to put another set of fresh batteries into the player. No where in the manual does it discuss this procedure. I was sure my player was broken. A little more info. on the company's part could have saved me a lot of frustration."
5,Great MP3 Player,"It had a very annoying problem of playing CD songs in alphebetical order even if the song name was preceded with a song number, but downloading the latest firmware update fixed this. Go toto get the latest Sansa firmware. Loading the firmware is very easy.Sound quality is great with my headphones. I haven't even tried the headphones that came with the player as I'm sure they are cheap & low quality. The player is great though I'm 100% satisfied."
3,Nice except for weird navigation and no MP3 resume,"I've had it for almost a month now. Pretty much agree with all the previously mentioned pros and cons. The 2 big CONS are the wierd navigation: it only categorizes music via its ID3 tags, and ignores folders. It kinda forces you to have perfect ID3 tags for all your MP3s - i know I don't have perfect tags. If you listen to MP3 audiobooks (especially those with LONG file-lengths) the total lack of Resume is pretty brutal. As previous people have said, having to try to find where you left off in a 70 minute long MP3 is a total drag. Email to Techsupport about said no solution. Pretty crazy as this resume function was present on my 5 year old Creative Nomad II!"
2,"OK for Music, No good for Audiobooks !!",This is not a bad player for music (mp3) but uselessfor Audiobooks in mp3 format.It will only resume from the start of the track notwhere you left off and there is no bookmark featurefor mp3 files.(Some Audiobook tracks are over 20 minutes long)I'm surprised as their earlier model resumes exactlywhere I left off.I'm puzzled why they would remove a good feature.
1,Not as Advertised,"The Sansa E140 is not able to play all secure WMA formats. If you are using Net Library for your audio books, this is not the player for you. The Sandisk help desk confirmed that the unit does not support WMA format 1. Also, the Sandisk help desk is slow and difficult to contact. All online inquires took more than 24 hours for a response and I was not able to contact them via phone."
5,Sandisk,Great little audio player in its time. I passed it on to my young niece and she loves it. Still works great.
5,WHAT CONS??!!,"this product is much better and practical then any other product I have used. If you cant drag 'n' drop. Then go to sync list,wmp 10, go to edit playlist and click on the songs that you want. There are not as many bad things about this product that everyone is saying. Espicially for those of us who READ BOOKS!, not listen to them."
3,Sandisk SDMX2 1 GB,"It's a good player., the batteries don't last nearly as long as indicated in the description but, all in all it works well."
2,Never Again,"This product worked fabulous...for the first two weeks!! Then it said that I had to much memory on it but I only had 72 songs when it holds up to 240! When I would turn it on this message would pop up~~Not enough memory, Connect to PC and delete 4M of songs for Sansa system file. It then would shut itself down. I plugged it in to the computer w/ the USB cable and it started saying that the cable wasn't working but on the player it said that the USB was connected?! Called technical support and they had no clue and said send it back!! They said they too were having technical difficulties w/ their own equipment. WILL NEVER RECCOMEND PRODUCT-EVER!"
4,very interesting story,Even if the details may not be entireily true - how can Robert Wierner have memorized all the conversations word to word? - the story itself is very interesting.
2,Dull from Baghdad,"I found this book and thought it would be interesting to see what happened to the press during the war. Unfortunately for me all this author talked about was bureaucratic problems and drinking and smoking. I kept reading thinking that once the war started the book would pick up and at page 275 the war started but the book remained dull. I am assuming that the author is a much better TV producer then author or there is no way he would have a job with CNN.The book was dull, there is no way around it. The author kept focusing on his drinking and the issues with this ministry and that ministry - not the most exciting. I wanted more detail on what it was like in Baghdad leading up to and during the war - - all the author gave us was what it was like for him in his hotel. Overall I would skip the book and watch the movie."
1,Not much use,"I saw this workshop and bought the book to see if there were more useful items within it because the author's presentation was not something I was inspired by. I would recommend reading Andrew Weil, not Cohen's book."
2,Great UPS. But my God the NOISE!!!,The is great UPS if you don't mind the noise. The fan is extremely loud. The noise generated is similar to an XBOX 360. Totally unsuitable for a home theater environment.
3,It's ok for home use,The UPS was delivered quickly and was new as the ad had described. But I have 6 units from Cyberpower in rackmount formfactor and this unit seems like a toy by comparison. While it does function it is cheap looking & the PLASTIC housing is more like an egg shell then something you'd expect to mount with rack gear. I have to wonder of it was created just to low ball the rack grade EQ from APC and Cyberpower. Time will tell if it works for long or in a pinch but it seems more show than Go.
1,Smells toxic,"Once this unit was plugged in and warmed up, it emitted a strong plastic/electrical smell that filled the room. On checking around, I find this has been reported by many people as an occasional problem with this unit. It's a shame, because I have the previous version of this model, and it worked great for years. Also, there is mention here that the fan on the unit is noisy, but this one is silent. Even so, going to check with Tripp Lite on a replacement and/or return to Amazon."
4,Don't be misled,The Carlton/Silva series (2002) is NOT a reissue of the original 1989 Silva Screen three-disc set. The latter contains additional dialogue tracks as well as different incidental music and should be considered as a 'must have' to the serious 'Prisoner' collector. Most of the music here is original to this disc and not duplicated from previous releases. The main title theme as recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra (track 2) is worth the 'price of admission' IMHO.
3,good,"You could do a lot worse than this if picking 1960s soundtrack or program music, but you could do a lot better too.The Prisoner has all the bongos, jazz nuances, 60s keyboards--every charming ingredient that we love about such music of this era. There is even a faux psychdelic version of ""He's A Jolly Good Fellow"" that is pretty good once you stop laughing at it.The problem: this is caught between bad 60s soundtrack cheese and the funky jazz impulses that make the best film music of this era classic. You won't get the pretty pretty pretty of a Percy Faith here, but you won't get the jazz brillance of Quincy Jones or the funk attack of a Lalo Shafrin either.Some excellent patches here, but this prisoner doese not choose a side."
4,Not a 12pack - Only a 2pack,"I bought this product because the description read ""12 Pack"", but I actually received a 2 pack."
4,A touching story,"For anyone interested in what goes on 'behind the scenes' in baseball this is a really attention-grabbing book. And also for anyone even the slightest bit interested in sexism in America. And anyone interested in a very well written, entertaining, honest book about part of an amazing woman's life.I have such admiration for Pam, who was (is) obviously very skilled at her craft, but had to fight the rampant sexism in professional baseball and ultimately denied her dream because of it. As far as I know there has still never been a woman umpire in the major leagues. How is that possible in this country? Well, don't answer that. And as a comment on the title. Pam HAS BALLS! More than most of the men she had to deal with. Thank you Pam for sharing part of your life with us."
5,Philosophy as a way of life,Noted intellectual Pierre Hadot offers many thought provoking dialogues in this book. His reference for example on holiness was and is perfect. This book required some thought so for me it took a while to complete as each dialogue requires thought and quiet reflection. A book which is a joy to read and have and adds persective to my study in non dual philosophy.
4,Philosophy as a way of life,"Recontextualizes the role of imagination and reason in ancient philosphy as spiritual excercies, thus restoring the diagnostic and theraputic role that ancient philosophy had."
2,Not Philosophy,"Although Hadot does know his stuff, me mostly talks about other people's view on philosophy. I found this book to be quite a tease. Hadot rairly gave a good description or analysis of ancient texts. I was always interested in philosophy, but this book did me no good exept lure me to read Plato: The Republic, which I had read before in college. Plato: The Republic gets to the heart of ancient philosophy by giving a great translation of the ancient Greek texts. Making it feel like you were there when Socrates and Thrasymachus engage in one of the greatest battles of intellect and reason. And their topic of interest; 'what is justice and injustice?' a question that is still debated. Even though these dialoges date back to 380 B.C., their reasoning can still be applied today."
1,Not what was advertised,"What I received is not what was advertised.It says Complete Set 6X2.It is neither.1) They shipped ten cartridges, not twelve2) Four of them were black, two of them double-cartridges that do not fit in the i-series Canon printers that use BCI-6 inks.3) Hardly a full set. No photo-cyan, no photo-magenta.4) Even the package looks nothing like that shown in the picture on this page. No cardboard outer package, just the individual plastic bags.Order these at your own risk, and don't expect to receive what is promised here."
3,about expected,The cartridges where leaking when they got delivered. I was using then to flush out ink jet printer so I didn't care. Cheapest ones I could find and I got what I paid for. Didn't contact seller.
4,A great book with a few unrealistic touches.,"I loved this book to its full extent. It is a perfect representation of some Americans travelling abroad, both of the foreign native extremist types that want to become like those of the native land and that of the American tourist type that can never fully appreciate a land and its people. It also has many implications on the development of West Africa and its role in the global economy. The only part that was disbelievable was the African magic that was actualized in the old American's closet. It is certainly worth a read, not only for the story, but for the cultural content that is difficult to find in other sources."
3,A lot of book with a rushed ending...,"I was very much drawn into the writing of Dooling, and I must say that there were times when I could not put the book down. Dooling weaves an interesting tale of African ""witchcraft"" and ""voodoo"" with almost comical portrayals of urban professional Americans.It takes quite a while to get into the really exciting parts of the book (about the voodoo and secret societies), but you have a good time when it finally comes. I felt the ending was filled with excitement and suspense, but was a bit rushed. I wish that Dooling had taken a little less time defining his characters, and more time in building up the plot.I'd recommend this title to someone for a good ""companion"" read -- perhaps a long trip take-along."
5,Recommend it highly,"Well, I loved this book...reading about two cultures. I've recommended it to everyone, and everyone has enjoyed it. I'm such a huge fan. I learned, I laughed. It remains, two years after the reading, one of my favorites."
4,"Nearly Perfect, but darn good","Rick Dooling is a man who knows what to love and what to hate. He manages to create a world that looks a lot like ours, with characters just a little bit bigger than reality but close enough that they seem to be people we recognize, and as such, vivid, juicy, and alive. He skewers crisply but fairly--life in this book is very complicated. And the smug--including most of Western culture--are forced to rethink just what they believe about how the world is assembled. Not malicious, not whiny, not grumpy--just excellent satire. I wish it had been a bit longer--the ending feels jumbled upon itself, but funny, sharp, taut, and clever. Buy it!"
1,"Great picture, WORST LIFE SPAN","I bought this TV less than 2 years back from SAMS club. Was satisfied with its picture and sound quality. I used this tv for about 1-2 hours daily. Almost 2 years now, and it suddenly died. No reason at all. Overall, very dissatisfied after putting in $800+ 2 years back."
5,This one belongs on every Sierra climber's bookshelf.,"The excellence of this book is due to three things, in addition to the fine quality of the writing.First, by concentrating on an arguably ""100 best climbs"", not only does the reader learn useful route information but the authors have distilled here some of the best climbs the Sierra has to offer. Second, the format of a single page of route description and history, faced with a (usually outstanding) photograph of the mountain, really whets one's appetite for the climb! Third, most route descriptions are obviously left a little vague on purpose, leaving you some thrill of discovery if you attempt the climb.I am familiar with a number of the routes described in the book, and the authors have done a fine job of selection. There are many excellent ones to choose from, no matter what your taste."
2,Moynier book of lies,"I have used this book for several years and climbed a handful of the climbs listed in the book. The topos and route descriptions are helpful, but plain wrong in several instances. Having this guide is better than having nothing but you will quickly learn to take the information with a grain of salt.Don't get me wrong, I never expect to have every inch of a climb laid out, but the book has increased the adventure factor on a few occasions.My 2c"
4,IF you grow turfgrasses in the south read this book,This really a text book but it read like a great book on turfgrassesas a master gardener I use this book in my class.
4,Good turf management book,"This book provides a compehensive discussion of turfgrasses and their management. There are plenty of pictures showing grasses, weeds, and diseases suffered. The pictures are all very clear and close up so you know what you are looking at. There is also plenty of info on how the manage(fertilize, mow, etc.) grasses. I actually used this book in a class taught by the author(Dr. Richard Duble); while I used this as a college textbook, this book does not read like a college textbook so it should appeal to a wider audience."
5,Ladie's Movado Trembrili Watch,"After mulling over several different styles from the Movado collection, I chose the Trembrili model with mother-of-pearl face and glad I did. Elegance plus is the best way to describe this watch. Slim profile, very lightweight on the wrist and stunning. This watch will compliment any fashion. If you are looking for a comfortable and classic watch to pair with jeans or that little black dress, this is it."
2,insignificant pamphlet,"this booklet only contains 50 pages,the pictures that show different earthquake damage effects are all of China, the charts and tables of information are the only thing interesting in this little pamphlet style booklet,much of this booklet centers on the New Madrid earthquake area, which, is in central U.S. but for the rest of the central U.S. there is very little info.It is true though, that, there is very little significant earthquake activity in the central U.S. that is of any interest,and I think this booklet costs too much for what you get.Much of the info in this book can probably be found in other more worthy books."
4,The glories could have been even more...glorious,"Handel operas nowadays receive impressive stage productions and become increasingly popular. This is a great collection if you want to hear some of your favourite Italian opera singers like Sutherland, Tebaldi, Pavarotti, Evans, Berganza and Horne sing Handel. Especially the young Sutherland and Pavarotti are sensational!Considering on the other hand that Decca has now recorded many Handel operas with excellent Baroque singers, I find this recording to be somewhat outdated. It wasn't necessary for example to have Sutherland, Horne and Berganza sing two different roles when the same parts have recently been recorded by excellent newcomers like Dessay, Von Otter, or Scholl to name a few. Why stick to the past when the present has so many wonderful Handel singers?Overall however, a decent introduction to Handel's music."
5,Terrific Collection of Handel.,"I have owned most, if not all of these performances on various recordings over the years & have loved them all. Now to have them all together is like magic ! What a gift. All excellent...I especially love B.Greevey, whom is perhaps not as widely acclaimed as the others. First heard her years ago. What dignity ! Listen & Love it ! *JTQ"
2,Not As Good As Others,"Cohen's book is okay and will probably be helpful to those who haven't read any other admissions books, but Michelle Hernandez's (A is for Admissions) and Andrew Allen's (College Admissions Trade Secrets) books are both MUCH better. Those books provide a lot of specific details, inside information and great--and very candid--advice. Cohen comes across as something of a novice compared to Hernandez and Allen."
1,Not Much Here,"This book had a lot of hype propelling it, but I was disappointed. The insights are not very original or insightful; Cohen comes across as more of a college admissions observer than a college admissions insider. Never-the-less, this book could have been a good overall review of the process if it weren't for the tone. Her tone is one of arrogance and condescension, and I'm surprised that it got through the editing stage (one would think an editor would have improved the tone to improve the book's mass-market appeal). You can find her advice is almost any college admissions book and not have to deal with all the attitude and self-congratulatory rhetoric."
3,"OK, but not the best","This was the first book I read on admission to the Ivys, and I initially thought it was great. Since then I have read ""A is for Admission"" and ""The Gatekeepers"". Both of those books are far superior to this one. Ms. Cohen is either at a disadvantage because she never worked on an admissions committee.This book is probably worth buying for the chapter on admissions essays alone. That is the strongest part of this book.That some parents would pay Ms. Cohen $33,000 for her help and guidance in getting their childen into an Ivy League school only demonstrates that some parents have more money than time and common sense. There is no ""magic formula"" for getting in. Any parent with a bright child can do what Ms. Cohen does with proper planning and encouragement.Big Hint! Start at the beginning of ninth grade and concentate on focused volunteer work and a demanding curriculum, not a scattershot of activities combined with good grades in easy classes."
5,The Truth About Getting In: A Top College Advisor Tells You Everything You Need to Know,The Truth About Getting In: A Top College Advisor Tells You Everything You Need to Know
1,A college advisor sorely lacking grammar skills?,"From the teaser above the title:""Why some top colleges are better for you _then_ the Ivy League.""You'd think someone with a Ph.D. and supposed tenure at two Ivy League schools would be able to correctly copy read THE COVER of her own book. Or at least pay someone to do it."
2,Annoying product,"The design of this garbage can looks attractive, but it's not very functional. Like many of the other reviewers, I find that the lid on this can falls off quite often. Also, even though it says it has a 13 gallon capacity, it does not hold nearly as much as my previous 13 gallon Rubbermaid garbage can. That one had a more squarish shape. Given how difficult it is to keep the lid on this thing, I wouldn't purchase it again because it's just too annoying. Don't buy it."
2,Creates holes in garbage bag,"We've had this garbage can for a while now, and I would not purchase another one.The lid falls off, sometimes it just pops off. The mechanism that opens the can not only creates holes in the garbage bag, but also takes up alot of space in the can itself."
2,Holds trash but lid falls off a lot,"It's tall, it's slim, it holds a 13-gallon trash bag. However, the step-on mechanism opens the lid only about 3/4 of the way, and if you lift the lid by hand rather than stepping on it, it's as likely as not to fall off. This can drives my husband crazy. I am not sure why they could not just make one that permanently attaches to the lifter mechanism. We're going to have to get a different can, it's not worth the household irritation."
1,Junk!,"These temp gauges are garbage. I have personally owned four of them and all four eventually quit working. The hose is very sensitive to external factors such as TEMPERATURE of all things, as well as bending and just general low quality. One time the probe actually broke off and was floating in the intake.Do not waste your time, you are FAR better off with the electric version!"
3,Fun product...,Fun personalized sign...good quality.Packaging materials allowed the sign to be damaged during transit...no reply from vendor when brought to their attention.I was able to remove most of the bend/damage.
2,Don't waste ur money on this,Looks nice enough when it arrived but it can't hold heavy plates or pans. Within a week it was completely warped.
3,Disappointed,This item is okay but DID NOT fit my double sink as anticipated according to reviews. It was too big.
5,Excellent CD,"This is one of the best dancehall albums in my CD collection. For all you non-reggae fans out there who do not know what CDs are good, here is a very good one. Trust me, nah cuss me."
5,Unelectric,"Track Listing:1. PETE TOWNSHEND: Pinball Wizard [3:00]2. KANSAS: Dust In The Wind [4:03]3. KENNY LOGGINS: Angry Eyes [4:49]4. HARRY CHAPIN: W.O.L.D. [4:46]5.

5,Insightful!,"""Snakes in the Lobby"" opened my eyes to the corruption that is so prevalent in the arts, even underlying in the Christian market. It unveils the enemy's tactics and is a MUST-READ for EVERY creative type!"
2,"Yeah, what's new","I hesitate to sound so unenthused about a vision from God. And it is obviously a Scriptural account of one that God gave Scott MacLeod. I just wish he had taken that word from God and expounded upon it. He needs to give instruction on how to respond to this word. And although I find no fault with anything God said in the vision (although some of MacLeod's wallowing in unworthiness was a bit much), it is simple holiness in lifestyle that is being promoted. Why the vision when three or four verses from the Bible could be expounded upon in more challenging form?"
5,This is a great looking shoe!,This shoe looks great and appears durable. It fit my son fine and he wanted to wear them to school the next day. Great buy for the money.
1,Not a correct picture of NY,"The author has portrayed a very incorrect picture of the city, almost every neighborhodd is mentioned as great place to live, which is not really true.I wish author was more truthful, would have saved a lot of people a lot of time."
5,Wish I'd written it,"I relocate folks for a living, at one of the big Mahattan real estate brokerages, and I wish I'd written this book--though I doubt I could have done as good a job. I can't imagine a better volume on the subject of moving to and settling in New York City and the nearby suburbs. I recommend it to all my clients."
3,Can't put everything in a book,"For young people, there are listings for temporary cheap housing and temporary employment agencies. Essays on how to organize and plan your move which really only applies to families moving an entire house. There are tips on hunting for an apartment and on finding sublets. But the neighborhood descriptions are lacking. I better bet would be Zany's NYC Apt Sales & Rental Guide for great neightborhood descriptions-a must have. Forget the ""Getting To Know Your Town"" section, you're better off with a tourist guide with color pictures."
5,Contrails,"An authentic and absorbing account of a professional pilots life.If you have an interest in aviation you will enjoy this book immensely. And for those with an interest in the air war in Viet Nam, this book is a must.Scott"
1,Pulley good Mower BAD,Pulley was the only thing good left with the mower. Had lots of deck problems replaced the mandrels twice then when they broke again decided to purchase a new complete deck.
4,Nice to hear again,"Nice to hear again, nostalgic trip back to 58-62.No Do Wops, nothing worth hearing repeatedly.Into the file cabinet it goes..."
1,Worthless Junk!,"It's plastic junk - don't bother with this one. The gears do not mesh properly, causing inaccuracy in the measurement. In my case, I measured the same 300 yard path five differernt times, and had a variation of about 25 feet for each measurement, and never received the same measurement. I returned it and Amazon honored the refund as always... This is definitely not a high quality tool."
2,defect noted,The pocket clasp in improperly placed on the pen leaving an area without the pattern visible. this is where the clasp should BE. it is a manufacturing defect. I am returning it
2,Drawn outt,This was the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion. It was sooooo drawn out and certainly didnt need to be almost a thousand pages. This entire trilogy really was a good series just was overly boring at times due to unnecessary length added to the books.
2,Writing is shallow and repetative,I was fairly engaged in the last two books. This last one in the trilogy was incredibly disappointing. The writing was shallow and unimpressive. The battle scenes and any that involved strategy of any kind were the worst. It is like the author had never actually read about a war or studied tactics at all. The stilted writing and dialogue were almost as if someone else had written the book. Perhaps Mr. Marco should spend a little more time on each book instead of trying to milk the meager money that his publishers front him. C-
2,Cheap,"One of the wood shelves were cracked where the screw drives in. Wheel holder broke as soon as I flipped it over after being installed. At least add a few more of the wheel holders with the product in the event they break! Just hard to give it more than 2 stars. Considering, I didn't even have a chance to place it in my living room without leaning to one side due to the wheel issue."
3,Shelf split when screwing the stand together,"The stand looks nice enough. It was easy to put together, but one of the shelves split when I screwed on the side piece. It's not worth dismantling it and packing it up to return it. The shelf will never be used to hold any significant weight, so I don't see it being a structural problem."
3,Adding a dose of reality...,"I chose this namely due to all the good reviews here. However this isn't exactly the dream product users claim it to be. Yes, it is solid wood. Yes, it's fairly stable however:Fire wood is also solid.The wood for this unit is actually very cheap and looks cheap. Significantly lighter in color than the picture Assembly is not as easy as users make out. You'd need some ""flat pack"" experience if you want to ensure it's solid enough to trust it to hold your TV. There were also a bunch of preexisting scuffs and scratches in the grain.This was about $100 when I got it. As the price is dropped it may be better value, but it is certainly no bargain. You can probably find comparable products at local stores for half the price."
5,exactly what I wanted,This product arrived quickly and was easy to assemble. It works perfect in the corner.
3,Concept is cool.,"I like the concept of this product. Combination of soft sponge and rough scraper is cool. I thought it would be more robust though. I have a Breville grill. Sometimes when I grill, the cooking residue will bond tightly to the grill plates. For the most part, if you soak them, the residue can come of when using the sponge. When the residue is tough to get off, the sponge isn't strong enough to get the food off. Considering the price, I can't complain too much about how efficient it is. It handles light cleaning very well. The tougher cleans are a challenge."
1,Rather useless overall.,"At first I thought this sponge would be really helpful when I got my grill, but unfortunately it comes apart much too quickly. The best thing I've found to clean the grill is to just wet down a wad of paper towels while it's still warm and scrub it down quickly that way. It works much better and actually gets it clean, you really don't need the special sponges when they break down after a few uses."
1,Not really worth it,"The shaped sponge is nice and seems to be a perfect fit. It does fit the grill rather well, but it's quite soft, even the ""harder"" black portion. So, I'll end up smashing the sponge down to clean the grill and the contoured shape becomes useless."
1,I Deserve This One - Got Burned,"First, I should have listened to other reviewers who stated that these were poorly made. Second, I could have saved a bundle of money and received the same cleaning results with Scotch Brite pads. You can get a huge package of them at Costco or Sam's Club for a lot less than these ""George Foreman GFSP3 Indoor Grill Cleaning Sponges"", and the durable Scotch Brite pads can be used on everything. Save your money, guys."
3,its okay,This is an okay product. It didn't really give me a boner or anything like that. And it was mediocre at best as far as cleaning my grill.
4,Makes cleaning my Foreman Grill an breeze!,"It's slightly ""expensive"" for what it is, but it works extremely well, and it cleans well. The ""rough"" side is safe enough to use on the non-stick surface, and the grooves fit perfectly. Would buy again."
3,About sponges,These sponges don't clean as well as other brands but last longer. I'd like them better if they weren't so thick
5,Sponges,The George Foreman sponges work great on our new Hamelton Beach grille. The two choices of cleaning works great for tough spots.TOTALLY AWESOME
4,Excellent Sponges for George Foreman Grills,"These sponges are great for cleaning up after a grilling session on the George Foreman (or any other similar indoor grill). They have a rougher scrubby side, and a softer more absorbent sponge side so you can use either depending on the severity of the food residue. The sponge is grooved to make it line up with the grooves in the Foreman grill, though the grooves in my sponges aren't really as deep as the ones shown in the picture - not a huge deal, but somewhat less than perfect.Still, these things do a good job at helping clean up and it saves your regular dish washing sponges from getting too grimy and gross. I can't say that they're an excellent value - they're more expensive than regular sponges - but they aren't expensive either so I think they're a good buy if you use the Foreman even occasionally."
5,WELL WORTH THE MONEY,"This is the second time I have purchased these sponges, if you own a George Foreman grill they make the cleanup easy!! The seller I get these from, LilGift, is excellent on service!!"
3,It is OK,"I find it to be mostly useless. It is easier to use a paper towel and throw it way, rather than to use something that I have to clean and put back for the next use. For those that use the George Forman Grill. The best way to clean it is when you take your food out, before you unplug it, take two paper towels and soak them dripping with water and lay in the grill, then unplug the grill. When you are through eating, all you have to do is wipe it out with another paper towel. The steam from the wet towel, soaks everything loose and can just be wiped out."
2,Don't Bother buying this product!,The George Foreman sponges barely hold up to regular washing. The corrosive side starts to disintegrate almost immediately and the blue sponge side eventually starts to tear. Don't buy this product if you plan to use it for every day kitchen washing. Maybe it's o.k. for the actual GF Grill but why shouldn't it be o.k. for normal lighter washing of dishes and utensils!! Save your money and buy a good sponge
4,Need,"If you buy the Georger Foreman outdoor grill you will need the sponge for quick & easy clean up. If you use your grill a lot, I suggest buying several as they get tore up with a lot of use."
3,"Useful, But Falls Apart","With its built in grooves on both sides, this sponge and scouring pad does a good job of cleaning the Foreman Grill. However, the scratcher pad crumbles and falls apart very quickly.They are kind of expensive anyway, but when they don't last, it makes the price even worse. You can find them cheaper at Walmart than on Amazon, and skip the cost of S&H;, which is outragous for a lightweight item!"
4,A sponge! A sponge! My kingdom for a sponge! -- King Richard III,"These seem a bit expensive for mere sponges, but they have made cleaning the G.F. grill a much shorter process. It's still difficult to clean the crusty bits in the many corners of the top plate. Without these fancy sponges, however, it was worse."
3,"Good product, but doesn't last very long...","These sponges do a great job of cleaning the Foreman grill, but they don't last very long. The black part disintegrates rather quickly and makes a mess. I just haven't found another product to clean my Foreman grill yet."
4,Quick Delivery - Great product,Title summarizes this quite well - delivery was quick and well packaged and product is extremely useful for those who suffer as much as I do whenever the lean mean grilling machine requires cleaning.
5,Great Sponges!,"These sure make cleaning the GF a snap! I love the gray scouring material...it takes the crud right off and leaves no scratches behind. I have been using it on all of my non-stick pots and pans and it works great. The grooves are great for getting into all of the crevices on the GF.I don't know how they hold up yet, since I have only been using them for a couple of weeks, but so far, so good!"
5,Perfect for your George Foreman Grill,"Never knew these existed until just recently but if you own a George Foreman grill, there is nothing better to clean it with"
3,Sponges don't last very long.,"The sponge does its job okay, but I wish it were sturdier. When you clean the grill it just flattens. After several uses pieces of the black part fall off and get in the sink. I think Bed, Bath and Beyond and Linens n Things carries the sponge pack so you don't have to order them if you don't want."
3,Works Okay,Product pretty much does what it says. But it needs some elbow grease.Additionally the scrubbing (Black part) end tends todisintegrate into small pieces over time. But all and all productis okay.
3,Foreman's sponges,"I can't rate this product. I never saw or used it. Bought it as a gift for a grandson. (I bought him the grill earlier. As a college ""love-out, he has been thrilled with it.)"
1,review by a Paramedic who wants to save 2 hours of your life.,"I struggled to follow the old well travelled ""gonna lose the farm"" plot line set in motion by the ""on golden pond"" elder detached from reality scenario. Sadly Dark Horse did not have the benefit of writing adequate to see through the main or any of the numerous sub-plots i guess she got lost in them all:jelous husband in conflict with his still love sick after all these years brother.strained mother daughtercoming of age by several late bloomer adultsI almost forgot there was a child and an elder dealing with mental illness.All portrayed by poorly supported apparently first take actors.NOT ONE OF THESE INCLUDING THE MAIN PLOT FOUND A CLIMACTIC CONCLUSION IN 2 HOURS. It was as if someone had set their mind to make something so depressing that ""Little House on the Prairie"" appear comedic in comparison.In conclusion, 2 hours of plot and weak character delelopment that is so anti-climactic that you even get cheated out of a good cry."
1,Horrible,This is right up there in the top 5 worst movies I ever seen in my life. I expected it to focus on the training of the horse. Instead it focused on the dysfuctional family. The acting was atrocious. The only good thing about it was the few glimpses that were seen of that gorgeous horse.
2,Not a Family Movie,"Warning! This is not a family movie. I thought it was going to be about the horse and how he helped the family, but this plot line is very thin. It's mainly about a dysfunctional family. I should have turned it off when my husband got depressed from it. I was waiting for the good part, which never really came, except for a little reprieve at the end.The music however is beautiful and the scenery so that's why I gave it 2 stars.Now if you're more of a realist and can handle the dysfunction with no humor, you might like parts of this movie.I did enjoy the music and dance in the beginning and the horse scenes, but there were so few."
1,"If you're looking for a good family movie, this isn't it.","Like another reviewer, I rented this DVD from my local Redbox. My oldest daughter loves horses, and had been begging to see this. We assumed it would be a feel-good family flick about a horse, in the same vein as Secretariat, which we enjoyed. The cover and movie description lead one to believe this. The movie starts out very slow, and proceeds to get even slower. The characters are dysfunctional and unlikeable. The acting is poor. The focus of the movie is not the horse; rather it is about this dysfunctional family trying to deal with their father's Alzheimer's. My children were not only bored; we all found this movie very depressing. Definitely not the family film it is purported to be."
1,I HATE LEAVING REVIEWS!,"But since this movie is so freaking horrible just thought I'd add my two cents. As everyone else has said this movie plain old sucks!!!!! But what no one has yet mentioned is that the only person in this entire movie that knows how to ride the horses is the woman Patricia something, who actually lost the freestyle Dressage competition! Mom and dysfunctional daughter, neither of them have one freaking clue how to ride. Is it too much to ask to hire actors that gee I don't know know how to ride since this is supposed to be a horse type film???? In short DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
2,Nothing new to say...,"and quite a few stupid things, too, including hitchhiking as a viable transportation method. Many other books will give you much more info than this one. The real goal of this book is in the last chapter (yes, I read it all) - buy less. Buy less because it is better on the Earth, on your budget & on your health. I suggest you save on all of the above and don't buy this book."
2,Find the older version,"I bought this book thinking it would be a new and modern upgrade to the 1990's edition with reference to the internet, more ideas in the modern world type of thing. Well, I was dissappointed, if anything it is a watered down version of my old favorite (the 1990's version is my favorite), the new one is the old one with larger print and fewer pages... Stuff must have been cut out.I really enjoyed the previous version and would read it for enjoyment and diversion often, but the latest copy 2000, is really bad. I recommend going to a used bookstore and getting the older version."
1,Obviously nothing but a cash grab -- not really even updated!,"I, too, enjoyed the previous version, ""Living Poor With Style"" -- enough that I remembered that book for however many decades it's been. I expected this book to be equally useful and thought-provoking, and to have at least some new ideas.Man ALIVE, I couldn't have been more wrong. Looks to me like the author ""blew the dust off"" the old book and got a publisher to reissue it with a new cover. (Though, actually, I remember the old book being... well, SMARTER than this one, too. Admittedly, however, allowing for my standards changing over the decades, so I'm probably wrong about that part.)Anyway, for goodness' sake, be smarter than I was and buy10,001 Ways to Live Large on a Small Budgetinstead -- now, THAT book is impressive -- up to date and FULL of thought-provoking ideas and further resources. (THAT book is actually quite a bit better even than I EXPECTED this book to be.)"
2,Be careful this is not regular size,"Feel that this is a bait and switch. Product size is not listed in ounces, as American products usually are -- feel this is deceptive advertising. Would not have purchased this had I known it was so small. Charging more than half the price of the full size 7.5 oz bottle for less than 2 oz. Also, the foam is not aerated as it is in the larger size. Will not purchase again."
3,Travel size,"I love the OCuSOFT lid scrub. However, I was surprised when this bottle arrived to find that it was the travel size. I had only seen the large bottles and assumed it would be the larger size. It is impossible to tell from the image. If you don't need a tiny travel bottle, the 7 ounce bottle is a **MUCH** better value."
4,eye wash,"I like this version of the eye wash rather than the wipes. Better value and using a wash cloth is just as easy. if you havent tried, do it, this little bottle lasts and lasts."
1,picture misleading,"It's not the product that I don't like....it's the misleading picture that is just wrong! how many of you out there knowanything about ML measure? I don't. I buy this product from my eye doctor for 20 dollars which I think is high...well, whenI saw this on Amazon for 11.50 I thought it was a great deal so I ordered it. wow...when I got it....it ended up being a trial size.I am NOT paying 11.50 for a trial size. this is a VERY misleading picture and I will request a refund. Very misleading and the vendor SHOULD BE ashamed but I'm sure he or she is not. Buyer beware!"
5,This is OcuSoft Foam Original,There are two versions of OcuSoft Foam: Original and Plus. See my review of OcuSoft Foam Plus. Original is designed to be washed off; Plus is designed to be left on for more severe problems. Original is available in 50 and 215 ML sizes; Plus apparently is available only in 50 ML size.
1,China strikes again,"recieved these cutters in good time and condition. Just in time, as my old set had had it after many years. Needed some 3/8"" plugs for a job I was doing, Cut two plugs out of 3/4"" hickory,that was it for this cutter as it was dull and burnt. These cutters are junk! The one star is for the case they came in."
2,Tenon cutter sharpness,"I've only used the 3/4"" cutter a few times, but it already seems to cut slower (getting dull).I bought the set because of the price and limited use.If you plane on using frequently, buy a better set."
3,A fairly decent compilation of assort trance,"As opposed to many other albums that pass themselves off as ""Trance"" (i.e. Best of Trance series) with their comprimising EuroDance undertones, this album actually contains... for the most part...trance. The mixing is fairly good and the vocals aren't at all cheesy. A lot of big name DJs (Ferry Corsten, Blank and Jones, gusgus, Lange, etc.) round out this 2-cd set, making it an overall decent mix.A good buy for someone who is new to trance, although a tranceaddict might want to look elsewhere."
2,decent,"If youre a trance fan like me, (and I hope you are) you enjoy a variety of progressive, hard, and chill sounds. Unforunately, many compilation albums have four or five (if not more) tracks you've probably already heard. The tracks are good, with a few remixes. And if you havent heard of ferry corsten, you will after this album!! For the subtitle ""the best in uplifting and hard trance"" I really didnt get the same feel as I did listening to other progressive and hard albums/artists. If you're new to trance however, you should give it a shot. Over all, not bad, but not the best we'll see from BPM I'm sure."
4,Sony Headphones,This product uses larger than normal drivers which give better sound quality than most other inexpensive headphones. Good product. Good buy.
4,stocking up,"I own this headphone. I like the sound quality very much. it's really good for the price. I'm ordering 2 pairs. one to replace current headphone and one to save as they are hard to find in the stores these days. I'm not into ear buds. I would have given 5 stars except I'm buying a new set because the ear foam worn/ripped on left ear. I think I bought 2 years ago, my last pair was closer to $20.Yes, cord is short and I get tangled on my chair arm. I use at work to try and drown out office noise. I plug into laptop or CD Walkman.Overall a great buy. 5 stars for sound quality! They are much better than a JVC pair I tried for $20."
1,too short,"the line is really too short to use. if you have a front-plug on your computer, it's okay. But if hasn't, it's hardly to be used."
2,Work fine - briefly,"The sound on these is pretty good, the cord is indeed short as other reviews stated. However except to get what you paid for, less then two months after getting these they are starting to crackle and sound bad."
5,Great value,These headphones were puchased as a gift and they perform exactly as promised. I can't complain about the price or the performance. They are a steal for the price.
2,Poor sound quality,"This headset doesn't have very good sound quality. Sound was tinny on several tracks of Enya CD I was listening to. I didn't send back, because of cost of mailing."
3,Not bad.,"I could have done worse. While these are not the Stanton/Pickering/Superex/etc. top-of-the-line type headphones of hi-fi's heydays of the 60s and 70s, they are nonetheless competent enough in today's market to be pleasant and useful. What galls me is what these two headsets cost me with shipping, (almost 20 dollars!) These things aren't QUITE substantial enough to warrant that price, even with shipping, (packaging isn't that complex....distance isn't that far.) Why so high?Anyway, they sound good....the vendor just ought to go easy on S&H; cost!"
2,Terrible sound quality,"These are awful. It sounds like you are listening through water, and from a great distance. Dissapointing."
2,Headphones,These didn't hold up well for our 16 year old- he needed the foldable ones for his backpack at school-they would hold up better for someone using them at home or in an instance where they could hang them around the neck or placing them in a safe spot when not in use. Otherwise a great product for the right person.
2,Sony Bargain Headphones,"I understand the concept of ""you get what you pay for,"" and I also thought that the Sony brand stood for at least a reasonable expectation of quality no matter the price. So I was very disappointed to discover that these $9.99 headphones are inferior to the ones that came with the Magnavox JogProof CD player that I purchased from Kragen Auto Parts for $15.99."
2,I should have spent more money,"I just bought a Sony Ericsson W518a walkman phone and purchased these headphones for it. I went with Sony for the reputation and my past satisfaction. I have not received the headphone adapter yet, but I could not resist trying the headphones on my computer.I was immediately disappointed. They just don't sound good. I should have went for a better pair."
3,Average,Adequate. The raised letters designating right and left need to be larger and more prominently placed. Very light weight. Length of cord o.k.
4,Sony headphone work well but the wires are far too short.,I think Sony figure the person using this would have the unit in their front pocket. If they'd lengthen the wires it would be a very good reasonalbly priced unit.
4,Great for the price.,"Some inexpensive headphones were needed for a children's computer lab. These fit the bill perfectly. The sound quality is decent and they appear to be fairly sturdy (none broken after six weeks of kid use). For an adult, the over the head piece is a bit snug, but with a child's smaller head, they work fine."
3,Sit close to your Computer,"Headphones work great, comfortable, good sound quality, but wish the phone leads just came out of one side, another drawback, depending on whether you're are right on top of your PC or not, the overall cord length is too short, only 40"" long. There are better choices out there. I have similarly priced headphones that have a 98"" cord, and it comes out of only one side of the phones. I would recommend shopping around if this cord length may be an issue for you. Extension leads may be purchased, but cost almost as much as the headphones themselves! Luckily I had an old extension lead. Sorry SONY. A die hard SONY fan nevertheless."
2,could be a bit too open air,"These headphones are not adjustable to make the head size smaller. They don't really stay in place, so it is hard to hear the music when working out. I found some $7.00 ear buds at Target that work really well."
2,Eep,"They work, but that is about the best I can say for it. They are a poor fit to the ear and worse of all, the cord is very, very short. This is not suitable unless you can have the source very close to you, and useless if your audio jack is in the back of your computer as it won't reach."
3,cheap headphones,"i previously owned a sony light weight headphones that were smaller and better. the sony mdr 110 is not very loud. i had to double the volume compared to my old set. the cord is very short, about 23 inches from jack to yoke; and 39 inches from jack to headset. if you plug into a stereo or tv, you'll need an extension. also my set did not come with a jack adapter for larger input. my computer sound card is a creative sound 7 channel xfi gamer which has great sound. however this headphone's sound quality is mediocre and seems to have a split second delay. so if you watch music videos, it looks like lip syncing. they are comfortable and light but overall i would not purchase this product again.pros - light weight and cheap. construction and comfort are fine.cons - mediocre sound, very short cord (possibly made for people listening to mp3 device/ipods/itouch in shirt pocket). only mini jack (no adapter)"
4,Excellent Performance,"Excellent performance for the money, we have needed a replacement headphones for a while, and this headphone as far as I am aware is of excellent quality. My mother in law does not listen to music, she listens to AUDIO CD's (BOOKS) so the headphones are perfect for her listening."
2,a poor choice,"the sony MDR-110LP is a very poor choice of headphone,poor sound,stiff rubbery short cord.I just dont think it is worth the six dollars I paid for them.So far in my opinion for a low price headphone for less than five dollars from Amazon is the panasonic RP-HT21 with an excellent four ft. soft and flexable cord and very good sound for the price.."
5,Definitive tome on tone.,"Like drinking from a fire-hydrant. So much info, it is going to take years to comprehend. Excellently written, logical, and insightful. A little on the historic development of sound as a physical and psychological phenomenon, with lots of formulas, charts and graphs. Think of it like a college textbook on acoustics and you'll have an idea of what to expect. Somewhat dated, but great info. Recommended for serious recording, audiophile or musician looking to know more about what happens when air moves."
5,Master Handbook Of Acoustics,I have found this a very usefull and well written book. It is being used as a reference for a college course I am studying. It does require some knowledge of electronic principles but is clear and understandable. I would recommend it to any serious student of sound and acoustics.
2,Not a Handbook of Acoustics,"If you believe that the world of acoustics only consists of rooms and concert halls, this is the introductory book for you.Otherwise, the treatment of contemporary topics is piecemeal. The introductory material is not sufficient to inform the more recent elements (the chapter on digital sound is laughable).It is well worth the money for room acoustics. It should indicate that specific focus in the title. No where will you find psychoacoustics, instrument acoustics, microphone issues, and true recording issues."
4,"Very good, but...","Very good in relation to room acoustics, but almost useless out of America. The book does not acknowledge the metric system, and the chapters about construction apply to materials and construction methods used only in America.Otherwise, a really good book at hammering the basics in your head! If only there were metric versions of the equations..."
3,Essential and substantial,If you are in the business of sound and speakers you simply know it is required reading for proficiency in the profession.
5,This is an Outstanding Book,"This is an outstanding book for anyone interested in room acoustics. My motivation as an Audiophile for purchasing this book was to answer the basic question: ""Should my next audio investment be in room acoustic treatments, and if so what are the considerations involved?"" This book methodically breaks down every aspect of the behavior of sound, and how that behavior affects and is percieved by the listener. Reverberation, reflection, dispersion, diffraction, absorption, spectral analyses, modal analyses, room topology, etc., etc... It's all there. An absolute must have for any Audiophile."
5,EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT,"This is probably the most comprehensive source I've ever seen for acoustic applications. It contains material that is hard to find anywhere else such as human absorbtion of sound waves. I won't get into detail because of it being a source type text. If knowledge in the acoustic domain is your thing, this book is a must have."
4,Lots of information,"The book is very informative, useful if you are really an engineer. I'm not so I don't understand everything, but have learned lots from it."
4,Is a good product,Ia excellent product if you want to star the music learning. Is ideal for kids and for begginers and you can learn music alone at home.
5,"Excellent, detailed descriptions of routes in the Whites",1.From Marty's descriptions of routes I could visualize the roads he was describing. I've hiked the Whites for years and was familiar with many of the roads but never cycled on them. 2.I planned a week tour in the Whites before getting Marty's guide. Many of the loops covered the same roads I planned on using. The basic route was Marty's triple notch century with lots of loops. Marty's rides were an excellent check on my routes and improved my routes. 3.Marty's descriptions are filled with yellow from my highlighter as I took advantage of his experience with cycling in the Whites. His book was a great resource in planning my routes.
2,Ouch,These sandals are so cute and look well made but they hurt. Where the leather is connected at the ankle is a hard little knot to hold it together. Within 5 minutes I rubbed a sore on the left side of my foot that still hasn't healed and it's been 2 weeks. Naughty Hurty Monkeys.
3,Classy Thong Sandal,Black leather thong sandal with small heel and gold embellishments. They are classy and chic but slightly too small. I would order a half size bigger next time but I can still get away wearing the size I ordered. Not good walking shoes. Purely fashionable.
5,Great Life...,"Many people don't knwo who Gypsy Rose Lee was, if you don't she was one of the most highly respescted highly, highly paid strip teasers in the business. What made her different though was the class with which she did it. There was nothing leude, or vulgar about her acts, which was what made her a star. If you like reading about lives you normally wouldn't, like a burlesque queen. Then this is definately for you. She had an amazing life, and anyone can learn alot about how to face life through this book. It is not that long and is fast paced, filled with comedic interludes. All I can say is enjoy the show..."
5,From the Granddaddy himself!,"First of all, you have to know that all those other books that expose the truth are nothing but footnotes from Jordan Maxwells research. He is the God Father of this genre; exposing the truth of these organizations. He is a must to listen to, great orator, and his books are a must to start with. Let Jordan Maxwell introduce you to an unexposed world...you will forever see your world in a different light...I promise."
5,The Ultimate Companion Book to One Step Beyond,"I read this book in its entirety and could not put it down because of its informative and excellent writing style. A must read for all fans of One Step Beyond. The research is all the more remarkable because, due to OSB'S public domain status, finding copies of all episodes for viewing by the author in the preparation and publication of this book must have been quite a daunting task. Hopefully all episodes will be released one day. Until then, read this book as a ""heads up"" to that day."
4,One Step Beyond,This book is a must have for anyone who has an interest this classic TV series. Full of interesting antidotes and behind the scenes trivia. I highly recommend this book.
3,one step beyond,"I enjoyed reading this book. It explains each and every show produced. The only disappointment was that the actual actors (who were still alive when this book was published) were not interviewed. It is always interesting to read how they felt while the shows were filmed. As well there is no discussion about what went on behind the scenes. Maybe a little more in depth research could have been done to achieve this. Overall the book was interesting to read and I did have new insights on many of the shows. I wish the ""Next Step Beyond"" was on DVD. I wouldn't mind seeing them."
2,Disappointing,"The title says all. This is an analytical guide to the series. Behind-the-scenes stories and facts are not going to be found in this book. What you get is an episode guide, bio on John Newland, and a critique of each episode. Sadly, there are no other books on the subject yet but Mark Phillips book on science-fiction TV encyclopedia contains a lot more inforamtion. Count on McFarland Publishers to crank out an over-priced book and give you very little. (I already disappointed in their ""Thriller"" and ""Twilight Zone"" book.)The author of this book needs to check out books like ""Night Gallery: An After Hours Tour"" by Benson and ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" by Grams to get an idea of what people expect out of books like this. I paid $40 for the Grams Twilight Zone and $35 for the Night Gallery Benson book and I feel I got my money's worth. I paid less for this book and was disappointed."
5,From my Heart through my Soul,"I was a friend of the authors son. I was in the energy field of a works in progress. Letters; has been a very sacred tool in my discover of my purpose on this earth in this lifetime. It helped me return to my true home and opened doors which were closed for a long time. I am now a Reiki master and have been able to share The Cosmos with our masters through helping others heal themselves. Andrew, my dear,dear, friend is throughout Letters From The Cosmos.Carol has a heart and soul beyond the value of Gold, and her son was the salt of the Earth. I recommend the experience of Letters to each and every of us.PeaceJoseph"
2,Broke easily,I bought this for my boys ages 7 and 4 because it is rubbery and I thought it would be durable. I figured if they played with it and bent it it would be pliable and last a long time. They had it for 2 days after Christmas and Popeye's head broke off his body. It was very disappointing. It turned out to be a look at but don't touch item.
1,This set could use a dose of Spinach!,"Unfortunately, I have to second the other review on this product. After only a few days, Popeye's head fell completely off. And my children were not especially rough with the toy - they basically had the Popeye gang living in the doll house. It appears to just be a design flaw, the thin neck on the Popeye figure cannot support the big head.Considering the inexplicable dearth of Popeye toys out there, I was really hoping this set would be a winner. But with the main character's head falling off after only a few days of moderate play (and Gorilla brand super glue was of no avail), I have to urge folks to avoid these toys. It just leads to more grief, especially with younger kids who get attached to the toys."
5,"Immediate, honest, great songs, wonderful singing","WIA is a bonus album, and a wonderful experience. The title song is sophisticated and interesting, well done, but Hunger and When She Smiled are sexy and beautiful. I like it that the music is not over processed in production studio. Fresh, hot, and romantic. Total enjoyment. What's wrong with that? Not a thing. Enjoy."
4,NICE FOLLOW UP TO WINDOWS,IN THESE DAYS OF TEENY BOPPERS SUCH AS BRITNEY SPEARS AND THE LIKE-ITS NICE TO SEE A MATURE ARTIRST CONTINUE WITH HIS LATEST ALBUMN-WALKING IN AVALON. CHRIS IS MORE CONCERN ABOUT THE MUSIC THAN THE HYPE WITH PACKAGING-AS IS WITH MANY OF TODAYS CURRENT ARTIST. WHEN SHE SMILES AND WALKING IN AVALON ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS-HOPE HE CAN CONTINUE MORE GREAT WORK IN THE FUTURE AND RADIO WILL AGAIN GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO DISPLAY HIS IMMENSE TALENT!!!
2,Disappointing after 3 years of waiting...,"After a 3 to 4 year wait on this offering, it is obvious that its time Mr. Cross hire a competent producer to reignite his career. I've listened to this album at least a dozen times and still can't find any melody I can remember; any song worth significant airplay; or any growth as a songwriter. Cross has an incredible ability to write great pop hooks but they're no where to be found on this album. Lowering your voice an octave on Hunger was a nice approach but the song itself goes nowhere. Producing yourself as an artist can be dangerous. Rob Muerer plays in Cross' road and studio band and fills in the gaps on many of Christopher's songs. A producer - he is not. And it seems either is Cross. And waiting 3 years to write an album of this insignificance is a shame. I'll stick with the live side and wait until 2001 for something better."
3,Disc 1 is very good. Disc 2 is not.,"Christopher Cross's new album is half new studio music (disc 1) and half live concert (disc 2). The new studio songs are, for the most part, very nice. Cross's voice on the live disc often cracks during his falsetto and I just found it to be quite grating. Overall, If you like Christopher Cross, you'll probably be quite happy with this set."
5,Have to hear to believe,"This is absolutely the best display of intelligent, well-crated pop songs to come out in many moons by the most under-rated artist alive. You just have to hear it to believe it! My main purpose in writing this review is to let everyone know that there is a live video titled ""An Evening With Christopher Cross"" which is the VHS version of the live portion of this CD. What a deal!!"
2,Italian jazz? Not for me.,"I was intrigued by Piccioni's standout cuts on the great BEAT AT CINECITTA compilations, and captivated by the Mediterranean psychedelic langour of IL DIO SOTTO LA PELLE, and haunting, romantic CAMILLE 2000. FILM MUSIC is the first Piccioni CD that has disappointed me. Most of it is harsh, busy '60s jazz, with little of the intoxicating undertow of despair that defined his later, poignant music. Plus, many of the early tracks are mastered from noisy vinyl copies. The three short tracks from SENELITA are the exception; these haunting orchestrations resemble Milos Rosza's best. I recommend IL DIO SOTTO LA PELLE as a starting point, followed by CAMILLE 2000."
5,A GREAT BUY,"Now this was a good buy. The game seems huge with unending quests and unlockables, but this book sums it all up in such short, sweet, and detailed sentences. I loved this walkthrough. Somehow, even after I'd beaten the game 3 times, this walkthrough still managed to open up my ideas to something new in the game."
4,Educational and Fun to Watch thse Glass Masters in Action!,"Great PBS special showing Chihuly and his extremely gifted peers and students making all that tremendously beautiful glass art that those of us who know and love Chihuly feel such awe and admiration for. Any true glass art lover will enjoy this educational video which shows the glass blowers at work, from drawing to finished product. Recommended."
1,Poor and boring stories,"I'm really wondering what kind of person could be enchanted by these tales as these are sooooo long and boring ; seems like an outdated book to me. Also I've noticed way better results in therapy with stories from Nick Owen which is a passionate story tellers.So if you want you to bore your clients, go for the tales of enchantement ; if you want passionate and effective stories go for Nick Owen."
2,Interesting......,"I started this book and almost fell asleep. The author could have made this a bit more interesting! As I read through it, I noticed small things that arn't correct. First of all, when she was talking about Draco Malfoy's buddy Vincent Crabbe, she spelled 'Crabbe' wrong. She spelled it 'Crabb'. That is something that any TRUE Harry Potter fan would pick up automatically, since through out all of the books, Vincent Crabbe is known as Crabbe.This book is good, though, in helping kids, and adults, really think about what they are reading (i.e. the questions about each chapter in the books). I recommened this book to anyone who is not familiar to Harry Potter, but don't be disgruntled by one person's point of view!"
1,congratulations!,The author needs to commended and congratulated for the courage shown in exposing her intellect (or lack of it) to the wide world. It is either that or a very obvious way of cashing in on popularity of another book. The cover says that the book was not approved by JK Rowling. One glance inside the book is enough to tell one why. The author has covered all bases and compared with every possible fictional and non-fictional character...including James Bond (and why not?! I can see the similarity...007 and Harry has seven years in Hogwarts). If I were to use one word to desribe this book...drivel is what I would say.
2,Sloppy,"Unfortunately I found the sourcebook to be too hastily put together. The craze for Harry probably led to that. I heard from other people that the sourcebook was usually incredibly informative ad very well put together. I don't agree, not with this anyway. Sure it has its uses, but I see its flaws as outweighing its virtues."
3,an interesting read,"This was an interesting book for me. I liked the Harry Potter series very much and was interested to see what somebody could write about these novels. I found it to be a good research job and one that keeps your interest in learning about Harry Potter.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the'Isms'"""
1,Don't waste your money on this junk!!,"I love the Harry Potter books; my kids love the Harry Potter books. We've each read all the books many many times. We bought four copies of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I thought that this book might be an intelligent, insightful analysis of the books, but it is mostly irrelevant, mumbo-jumbo thrown in apparently to fill the pages of the book-- the examples given in the other reviews listed here are just the tip of the iceberg. It manages to be pretentious-- in its claim to be a scholarly examination of the books, and insulting-- through its weird repetitive simple sentence structure and vocabulary-- at the same time. I tend to be a book hoarder and I will almost always finish reading any book that I start, but this one is going out in the trash, and I haven't read much of it. Any teacher who knows anything about children's literature or teaching reading doesn't need this book, and no kid would be interested in it."
2,OK if you want to read one person's view,"But there's precious little from the book which hasn't been debated and analysed on the egroups.com harry potter for grown ups mailing list - and it's much more fun to get to discuss hidden meanings and make predictions with other people, rather than read what one woman thought about the books. Plus, there's too much discussion of greek & roman mythology & not enough about british folktales about Grims, Hands of Glory and dragons in Scotland. Which do you think is more relevant to a story that takes place in the British Isles?"
2,who did her research?,"The only thing that I liked about this book were the discussion questions at the end. I am not sure who did her research, but some of the basic facts were wrong in her overview of characters. It is one thing to speculate on the nature of the stories, that is to be expected in this kind of book, but facts that have been spelled out in the books are not open for debate. for example, she misidentifies several characters. also, the last section of the book, when she speculates on the future of harry potter, is nothing more than filler material. it serves no purpose other than to use up a few more pages. save your money. if you are interested in it, go to the library, it isn't worth the cash."
1,Pretentious and error-ridden,"I ordered this book sight unseen for a couple of young Pottermaniac friends of mine and wish I'd waited for more reviews. I estimate that ""Teaching Harry Potter"" contains about 10 percent useful information and 90 percent irrelevant speculation or out-and-out errors. ""Gringotts"" derived from ""gringo"" (as in greedy foreigner)? The Ministry of Magic's acronym, MOM, suggestive of the way it mothers wizards? Oh, please. An entertaining, thought-provoking book on Harry's world would be wonderful, but I'm afraid it remains to be written."
5,Finally a shoe storage solution that works!!!!,I have purchased quite a few over door products but they always end up in my trash! This product was easy to follow the instructions and fit my door just great! Granted I can't get as many of my husbands size 13 shoes as I can but that is just plain common sense! I love it!
1,falls apart constantly!,"I used it on the front of my door, and intially was delighted at how many shoes it held. Untill I came home and found the bottom part had seperated from the upper portions. I took time and reinforced it with duck tape, as I didn't want to screw it directly into the door, since I rent. Well now the whole dang thing is down. Except the part that hangs on the door. I have 20 pairs of shoes all over the room now.I was beat. I no longer have the box so I got stuck with this contraption.Save your money. Unless you want to put flip flops on it."
1,Waste of Money,"As the others said this item does not stay together. Sadly, I bought it without reading the reviews. The 3 parts that are supposed to ""snap"" together, but do not snap or stay connected in any way. Piece of junk."
2,Keeps Falling Apart!,"This shoe rack looked like the one I had previously but it keeps falling apart. I don't have it completely filled with the 36 pairs of shoes it's supposed to hold, (I have 24 pairs spaced out) but each day when I come home, I find my shoes all over the floor and the bottom two sections separated from the top! Maybe if you only put one pair per rack like in the picture it'll hold. I don't recommend this!"
3,"A bit on the flimsy side, but does the job","I can't really get upset because it didn't cost that much, But it is made of relatively thin plastic which does snap. The show rack is not that deep so if you have tall or long shoes, they don't sit well in the rack. But for the money I paid it is better than having my shoes all sprawled out over the floor."
1,Not worth the effort,"Although this product could be a good thing, they do not supply anything to connect the bottom to the door so it swings free and all the shoes slip through the rungs and end up in a pile. The company was kind enough to send two more clips to me but they did not fit on the bottom piece. Too much work, I bought 2 and sent them both back."
2,Not good for inside closet door.,"This is a very unattractive unit. I returned mine because I had bought it with the intention of hanging it inside the closet, but it's too wide and you can't close the door. If you have any shelves in your closet that come out near the front, this option won't work for you. It's really a ""front of the door"" shoe rack, but it's not very pretty there..."
1,THE WORST PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Do not buy this product!!! Does not stay together. NOT SURE HOW A COMPANY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS WITH A PRODUCT THIS BAD!!!!!!!!!!! IF I could I would give it a -100 stars!!
1,Save your Money,"This is near impossible to get together. Once you firmly tap the metal units into one side they will not go into the opposite side and keep popping out. After a half hour of frustration, I packed the whole thing up and am returning it."
5,"Heard one song, had to have CD","I left my TV on while I drifted off to sleep one lazy afternoon. I had it tuned to DirecTV's ""Soundscapes"" channel, and they started playing ""A Day Gone By."" Not long into the song, I woke up to the single consciousness of ""Jeez, this is an excellent song!"" I scrambled for pen & paper, and jotted down the author/song info and hit the 'net. Couldn't find any decent MP3s longer than 30 seconds, but that didn't stop me. Found a link to Amazon's site and proceeded to order the album."
5,MEDITATE TO THIS.....,"ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, TRAVEL FAR AWAY IN YOUR HEART AND MIND LISTENING TO THIS ONE. IT SPEAKS FOR IT'S SELF...TRY IT. JUST LIKE SPENDING THE DAY IN THE ORIENT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR A VERYROMANTIC EVENING TO REALLY SET THE MOOD AND TAKE YOU TO ANOTHERLEVEL."
2,Noisy,The performance is thoroughly ruined by prolonged applause. I simply don't see the point of including all that noise in a recording. Who cares about the stupid crowd ?
2,It's not getting better,"Wasn't that the Phillips slogan for a while? ""You've got to admit it's getting better?"" I bought this player 4 years ago and it has died already. The reason I purchased this particular one was because it was the right size and the one with the Phillips name on it. I have another ""boombox"" stereo that I purchased 12 years ago that still works fine. I would not recommend this product if you want something that will last."
2,It lasted for one year then the switch broke,"It was fine until just over a year almost daily use. The slide switch which changes function doesnt work, so it can now only be used as a CD player.Unfortunately its out of guarantee."
2,Extremely Unstable & Buggy on Windows Vista,"After doing a little research, this seemed like the best of the automated business plan builders, so I purchased it despite its shelf life of 6 years. While many older programs run fine on Windows Vista, this is definitely not one of them! First of all, it tried to update itself upon its initial opening but could not find my Internet connection (which I promptly verified was working). It then crashed within ten minutes of first use when I tried to drag a bulleted line item to another position in the list. It again crashed when I tried to skip a section not applicable to my plan (which is allowed). It also crashes randomly. In other words, it is completely unusable on my up-to-date version of Vista SP1. I would cautiously recommend the product (which seems like it would be helpful) only if you plan to run it on Windows XP."
4,Classic Don Giovanni Leontyne's first complete opera record,"To say that this is ""the"" recording of Don would not be fair as there are excellent recordings on all labels. This is the first complete opera recording Leontyne Price made and was originally released on RCA Red Seal. It has gone thru many reincarnations on RCA then as a complete opera release on London/Decca. This time a good highlights recording has been released with the addition of new technology. The transfers is great and if this recording is one of your old favorites, as it is mine, you will probably add it again to your collection. Keep listening."
3,Give Me Love...Give me more songs!,"I like this cd, but I would truly love it if the running time was more than 55 minutes. I expected songs like ""You,"" ""Cloud 9,"" ""Ding Dong,"" or ""What is Life,"" to be attempted, but I was disappointed. I love They Might Be Giants, but they simply phoned in their cover of ""Savoy Truffle""; ""Within You, Without You"" is merely okay. The saving graces are Dave Davies' cover of ""Give Me Love,"" the Bennet/Burch cover of ""isn't It A Pity,"" and MoR's ""Devil's Radio.""I had hoped that this tribute would be stronger...it is better than the Lennon tribute, for what that's worth."
1,"hey son, lets go play frisbee","If you love the beatles and george harrison, this is in no way a good album for you. This takes great songs like Within, Without You and Here Comes the Sun, and butchers them in the most heinous manner. Please stay clear of this album if you want to remember George and how great his music was/is."
4,A Rich Collection of Diverse Sonatinas,"There are several sonatinas that are first printed in the U.S., I'm glad to find them in this book and I played them for my students first,then ask them to choose.Obviously this book has a lot of sonatinas from different composers such as Denes Agay, Benda, Latour, who are really rare to find in other books.The difficulty of these pieces is from early to late intermediate piano students. Each piece contains all the movements so it is complete. There are about 19 sonatinas and it may take an average student about two years to learn every piece. Therefore, this book is a good buy for students who liketo try some fresh pieces.This book was published in 1970s so the price is pretty affordable since these days some piano music sheet with 80 pages can be over nine dollars."
5,Does the only trick it needs to....,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked out. Initially concerned about the size, the Line 6 Relay G30 slipped right in. It is held snug so no worry about it falling out. I was able to thread a cable through the bottom opening thereby allowing the unit to sit upright in the pouch. This allows me to easily see the lights on the unit as well as reach the on/off switch to shut it down between sets saving battery life. I highly recommend this piece particularly for use with G30."
3,Not what it should be,"I got this for my Electro-Voice RE-2 transmitter. I have two issues with it:1. The top flap covers the RE-2's on-off switch and battery indicator. You have to un-Velcro the top flap to see the indicator or access the switch. This means you cannot see if your battery is dying during a performance. I'm probably going to end up cutting a hole in the flap, which will involve cutting away most of the neoprene, thus making it weak and insecure.2. The pouch does not securely attach to my guitar strap, which defeats its whole purpose - it's supposed to keep the transmitter from moving around, but the whole thing just slides up and down the guitar strap. I solved this problem by putting industrial-strength adhesive Velcro on the strap, but really, I should not have had to do that.This thing does protect the transmitter and prevents it from detaching, but if you want your transmitter to stay in one place, you need additional Velcro or duct tape."
4,warm,"This Card isn't quite like the normal WINTVR-1600. It has the addition of a fm tuner as well, which surprised me when I opened the box. This card WILL, however drastically affect the heat output of your system. This card is doing a lot of work, and it outputs at a heat level to match"
4,Don't buy from PC Universe on Amazon,"Ended up going to CompUSA to purchase this item. PC Universe (via Amazon) shipped me the incorrect product and have not refunded my money to date.Once purchased from CompUSA, product is great. Not using the remote that came with, but a Windows Media Center remote. Great product! Be sure to purchase an antenna!"
1,total crap,"this gives you the impression it works with xp it does not, you don't get win tv just drivers. so it can do nothing unless you have window 7 media center. tech support hung up on me, they can kiss my ass. will never buy their products again."
2,not worth the trouble,"i wound up going with the 1800 on a vista capable system, have not looke dback."
2,gresh bargain hunter,"The first day i got it i was really excited but after an hour of playing around with it it broke. Very low quality. Trying to fix it at a jewellery store. If you buy it, treat it with lots of care."
2,THE PRICE IS WAY TO HIGH,"I HAVE HAD THE SHRP XR20X PROJECTOR FOR LESS THAN A YEAR, I HAVE RUN IT ONLY IN ECONOMY LOW LAMP MODE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LAMP LAST LONGER.WELL AFTER 9 MONTHS OF LITE USE THE LAMP HAD 80% OF IT'S LIFE LEFT THAN IT DIED, ""DEAD DEAD DEAD"" MAN I AM PSST OFF $400.00 BUCKS IM OUT.THAT LAMP SHOULD HAVE A FIVE YEAR WARRANTY.I KEPT THE PROJECTOR CLEAN BUT BEWARE SHARP DID NOT PROVIDE ANY AIR FILTRATION FOR THIS PROJECTOR OR LAMP, AND IT PRODUCES A LOT OF HEAT AND THERE IS NO USER ACCESS TO PREVENT DUST BUILD UP, MY PROJECTOR HAD A MODERATE AMOUNT OF DUST ON THE FAN BLADES AND INNER DUCTING BUT ANY DUST IS ALSO PUMPED RIGHT TO THIS LITTLE 3/4"" SQUARE SCREEN ON THE LAMP SO WITH NO FILTRATION OR USER EASY ACCESS THIS UNIT IS SURE TO FAIL WAY BEFORE IT'S USEFULL LIFE SPAN. THE PROJECTOR WAS A THOUSAND DOLLAR'S AND THE NEW LAMP WILL COST $300-400 BUCK'S SHARP SHOULD PAY ME OR AT LEAST TAKE THAT BONUS AWAY FROM THEIR ENGINEER'SNOT HAPPY WITH SHARPP LUEPKE"
3,Interesting but occasionally confusing for a non-linguist,"I read this book solely because I own a print of the painting shown on the cover... As curious as that may be, this book tells a lot about linguistics, why children say what they do and other somewhat useless explorations.Although this is all interesting, some of it falls out of normal understanding, without explanation so you are left confused and reading that section over and over again.Otherwise, it is, as it claims, a good starting to Linguistics."
4,Different - But decent,"With regard to the above review, I can appreciate the shock value of this new album. It doesn't include the acoustic work or character of his other albums. After my first listen, I was ready to trash it, too, I must admit. But I gave it a week. And after that week I couldn't take it out of the CD Player. The rhythms are groovy and very catchy, and I find Brooks' voice to be rather entrancing on a number of tracks. If you're expecting another standard Brooks album, you WILL be dissapointed, but give it some time and it will grow on you. I also thought it interesting that Border's Books near my home has NECTAR in prominent display so you can sample the sounds. It's time that Brooks finally got some exposure, and even if it takes this unconventially non-Brooks album to open others up to his previous works, so be it."
3,Violin and Latin Jazz,"The newer album of Susie Hansen called 'The Salsa Never Ends' had at least two hits in the Salsa dance scene, both in the USA and Europe. So I was really interested in her previous work. This album is more Latin Jazz and a nice album for listening. The combination of Violin and Latin Jazz/Salsa is something you do not hear often. I would though appreciate a bit more dancable songs."
4,Killer rock 'n' roll,"Any lover of rock 'n' roll must own this one. Dolls, Thunders, punk w/ good songwriting.....It's got it all: grungy (not GRUNGE)open chords, really cool lyrics, great shouty/singy vocals, drums about to fall apart (yet played well), driving bass lines, and just right ""hands off"" production. These dudes are smart but don't let that get in the way. There is no pretense here 'cause it's all in their blood. ANd whether yr a Bowie fan or not I'm sure you'll at least like, if not love, their cover. I know MainMan Michael Rank can write too. He knows all about everything from Nick Drake to Led Zeppelin to Hanoi Rocks and isn't afraid to show it. Buy it. Also buy all his other stuff- Mr Rank's solo work, early SOP and Clarissa, if you can find 'em! It's worth it big time. And....The early incarnation of SOP w/ Andy McMillan on bass and Sara Romweber on drums(sister of Dexter)are also amazing."
4,A Good Read!,"Keshavan Nair emphasizes the need for leadership based on a fundamental moral standard, as taught and lived by Mohandus Gandhi. The Indian leader embodied a moral life centered on truth, non-violence and service to others. Nair argues that business leaders today need to follow these basic principles. He stresses that these principles - and the practices based upon them - make good business sense in the long run, as well as being crucial to the survival of society. The text combines Gandhi's experiences with Nair's exhortations on how to apply these principles in the workplace. However, Nair provides few examples of contemporary leaders who practice these principles. Thus, the book occasionally comes across as somewhat preachy, wishful, overly idealistic and out of touch with the everyday realities of business. Yet, we at getAbstract.com recommend it in the face of those realities as a counterbalance, as well as a good quick read that encourages thought."
5,Leaders must read this,"If you are in charge of any amount of people for either family life, career or otherwise this is a must read. It's an easy fast read and is packed with good stories. enjoy."
5,Humanitarian,"I found this book motivational and inspirational. The societywe live in today reflects the opinions and speeches of Mr. Havel. Iuse this book like a bible..He spoke many truths to our nation.His speech on ""hate"" was so true about the ideas and thoughts of the Human Race in this world...His tribute as a President to treat people with such dignity and honor..His speech in ""Oslo"" was refreshing and exhilirating..I applaud his humanitarism. One day I would love to meet and speak to him."
5,Nice size!,I find most boomboxes to be pretty ugly but this one looks great. It is small and the green color is much better looking than in the picture. The display is easy to read and it has a headphone jack that you can plug headphones into. Amazon has a great price on it too!
2,senior acct clerk book review,"The book had a lot of areas to prepare for on the coming test, however,it doesn't have any scientific answers that even explain the answer. Just questions & the answers to them.....no info on the answers what so ever."
4,Gertrude Bell vs. Daniel Ladinsky,"I'm troubled (though not altogether surprised) by the previous reviewer's criticism of Gertrude Bell's translations of Hafiz by comparing them to the work of Daniel Ladinsky. I'm troubled because Daniel Ladinsky is not a translator of the poetry of Hafiz. Daniel Ladinsky writes all-new, all-original English-language poems but publishes them under the name of Hafiz rather than taking direct credit for them himself. But I'm not altogether surprised by the previous reviewer, because Daniel Ladinsky's poems are far more popular in the United States than the actual poems of Hafiz, and most people who read Daniel Ladinksy's poems are under the mistaken impression that they're reading translations of Hafiz.Gertrude Bell's translations may leave something to be desired. But at least they're actual translations of Hafiz."
4,Great Intro,"This is the weirdest book! It was published in 1897 and it is now being replicated. The translation of the poems, one should not be too surprised, are basically in King James' Biblical English! She (Gertrude Bell, the author) actually uses the words ""ye"" and ""thou"" and ""o'er""! The sensuality of Hafiz is thus systematically eliminated! Read Daniel Ladinsky's ""The Subject Tonight Is Love"" to see the difference.The introduction, on the other hand, is a delight, and it is worth the price of the book itself. It gives insight into the Victorian mindset, allowing one to triangulate a position in respect to the Divine, given the simultaneous thoughts of Hafiz in the 10th century, Bell in the 19th century, and the Beloved Reader in the 21th century!"
5,Excellant Book,It has been over 2 years since I played Myst. When I read the book I enjoyed the story but could not understand what it had to do with the game. Then when I played Riven it all made sense.I think Riven explains things a little better than Myst did.
4,Goes well with the series,"This book has all of the information on what happened leading up to the birth of Gehn (Atrus's father from the book of Atrus). I like it better, in fact, because D'Ni is much more alive with a million people in it and I have a greater respect for the writers' good use of descriptive abilities. I definitely recommend if you liked the first book at all."
4,Needs better writing,"I am probably the biggest fan of the whole MYST genre out there; I live for it. MYST was my first immersive game and I could tell that there was some real thought that went into it. It was subtle enough to be realistic, while at the same time having enough fantasy to be intriguing and fun. Imagine my surprise when MYST: The Book of Atrus did the same. It really captured the subtlty of human interaction in that the dialogue was concise, the people were thought out, and the story took long enough to develop itself. MYST: The Book of Ti'ana came close, but lost it in the simple fact that it did too much in too little time. If they had carried out the dialogues and character development out a little more, and allowed the people to flow more smoothly, it would have worked much better and possibly have surpassed the original."
5,Excellent for Myst-players,"When I read this book, it was after I beat Myst, then Riven. I didn't read Book of Atrus yet and I am glad I didn't. I think it was better to read this first, then apply it to the second, but anyways... I felt that it was definately a movie-type storyline with a lot of suspense and drama. I think the back of the book ruins the surprise (the review on the back), but otherwise I almost teared at the end because that was such a dramatic way to end things. Can't wait to read D'ni!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"THIS BOOK WAS EXTREMELY FUN TO READ. YOU GET TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT GEHN AND ANNA. IT WAS INTERESTING TO FIND OUT THAT GEHN USED TO BE GOOD WHEN HE WAS A KID. EVEN THOUGH THE BOOK OF ATRUS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ THIS BOOK STILL DESERVES A 5 STAR RATING BECAUSE I STILL HAVE NOT FOUND A BOOK THAT IS BETTER THAN THIS ONE, OTHER THAN THE BOOK OF ATRUS OF COURSE. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS ONE!! BY ALEX ALBAN"
5,Absolutely Outstanding!!!,"What can I say that has not already been said? I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had all the elements of a great story. Highly imaginative, excellent plotting and pace. Character development was second to none. You don't have to be a fan of the games (Myst and Riven) to enjoy the books, they stand alone!"
4,All in one great value for money,"If you are looking for an all-in-one home theater system with all the new goodies, then this is definitely the one to look for. At [$$$], it has Pro Logic II, a feature not usually found on other systems with similar price, which actually converts your normal stereo sound to 5.1 surround (now my TV sounds surround!). It also has progressive scan too, a big plus. It plays MP3, VCD, CD-R/RW beside DVD. Furthermore, the player looks very cool with its metallic casing.On the minus side, the speakers look mediocre like some [low-end] computer speakers, but the sound is clear and crisp. The remote that comes with it look like [low-end] plastic, very unattractive. Anyway, what I really care is the numerous functions of the remote.In short, if you are looking for a budget home theater with all the functions, then this is the one you should go for."
4,Decent system,"I really like this system and haven't had the horrible experiences other people seem to have. The system worked well right out of the box 3 months ago and continues to have no problemns. The sound is good - though if you like really loud music go for the 450 watt version. The speakers are small but produce nice sound (even though they are a little cheap looking). There are great features in the progressive scan DVD mode - though the remote is a little annoying to get used to. Also the fast forward feature when listening to music is not constant (it jumps in 10 second or 20 second intervals only). Despite this, I've been really pleased - especially considering that other PS DVDs with Dolby Pro II cost HUNDREDS more. Not a bad system at all."
5,Gianna D'Angelo - a Delightful Gilda,"Gianna D'Angelo's ""Gilda"", her signature role, is one of the most magnificent interpretations ever recorded. Her coloratura soprano is brilliant, agile, and beautiful throughout its entire range. The ""Caro nome"" is heavenly - her control of the sustained lines throughout the aria is simply breathtaking. The other artists handle their roles well and the live recording is vividly and evenly captured. A ""must"" own recording!"
4,"Nice to have, but not so much history","I honestly thought the DVD had more History content, but it is more about Deep Purple's Hits than how they became so great. I still like because I'm a Deep Purple fan, but I wanted MORE history."
4,"An enjoyable, slightly different romance","Kathy Lynn Emerson captures the feel of an email exchange without using the actual messages, making Sight Unseen an enjoyable, slightly different romance."
1,I don't recommend,"My step-daughter, 13, really got into this series, much to my husband's & my chagrin. As with many Japanime & manga series, this one is chock full of ghosts, curses, mystical storylines, & occultic overtones. Though I know many young readers will disagree with me (& that's quite alright, as I've read these books & know what's in them), this series is simply not appropriate for young ones, especially Christians. If you simply do not want your child reading Japanime porn, but you're not concerned with the occultic issues, then you will probably be fine with this series.If you're looking for something similar, minus the aforementioned details, check out the Serenity series by Realbuzz Studios. I provided step-daughter with those after reading them, & she loves them."
3,Fine performane spoiled by recording,"No one is likely to be disappointed with the singing and playing on this recording. The problem with it is that it was recorded live, and every movement of the performers on stage, every rustle in the restless audience is extremely audible. Furthermore, no libretto is included. It should also be pointed out that this is not the Maria Stuarda with Pavarotti which is praised in the Penguin Guide. Lovers of Donizetti and of Sutherland will be pleased, particularly at such a bargain price, but there are many bel canto recordings available which are far more listanable and accessable."
2,An OK Book...,"Much like the second volume, this is an attempt to be scholarly towards a looked down upon genre, the Zombie film. In some respects, such at total conclusion of films from the popular to the absolutely obscure, this succeeds. BUT, as in the sequel, sigh, the author keeps using the silly term, CANNIBAL ZOMBIES. I hate this term. The entire word Cannibal (yes I'm nitpicking), means one who preys on the same species. Thus a human who eats humans in a cannibal. A zombie doesn't eat other zombies, or there would be no problem in Romero films and The Walking Dead. Zombies eat us. They aren't cannibals. I wish the author would go back and edit both volumes and remove this hackneyed reference. Not only is it wrong, but he uses it SO MUCH. Would I say not buy the book? No, it's a fine reference, but as a zombie fan and author, that term simply has got to GO!"
2,Not what I'd hoped,It would have been better if it was more in depth on the more popular zombie movies and less on the lesser known. Didn't realize before purchasing there wouldn't be much for pictures.
3,Enjoyable but awfully expensive,"While I enjoyed this book and found it to be very comprehensive, I do think it a tad overpriced at $35.It isn't very long, and the short entries about the film and TV episodes make it most suitable for bathroom reading.I recommend it, but think it would be better value as a paperback, if it is ever issued as one."
5,Classic Funny outside the Monty Python,"Great classic comedy, perhaps a cult classic. Great job from all actors. Kevin Kline shines in his malevolent role. Cleese shows his humor is much more dimensional then Monty Python. Great flick."
4,"Great trucking game, but?",It is real fun to drive coast to coast picking up trailers and smashing past traffic. The graphics are great and love the different engine and horn sounds. CB is nice touch. Less one star here for haveing weigh stations that are bugged. You can stop on the scale and then go when its ok but then a cop will catch you and fine you for not stopping when you really did. Also you can never run from the weigh station cops. They can go for miles and miles and even in on coming traffic and suddenly pull you over. Running my truck company with employees is really fun. I wish that I was able to switch trucks with some of my drivers since I bought all the trucks. It is an excellent game regardless. Have fun.
2,Donald seems to have lost his house,"I love Donald Glaude his mixed live 1 is one of my favorite albums. I have seen him live several times & there is not another DJ out there that pumps up a live crowd like him, but that seems to be missing. I agree with the last review, there is no mixing in this album & Donald is famous for his mixing. I was very disappointed in this album & dvd. Buy it used if you want this, don't pay full price."
5,Interesting,The DVD encapsulates the college classroom with its straightforward and informative style. The lectures clearly explain the various scientific subjects.
3,Good compliation but 1988 was a very sad year for most Cheap Trick fans as Jonny B Good forced to walk plank by record Co stiffs,"Great Rick Nielsen cover with ori-ginal five-neck Hamer guitar! Goodsongs on here but Lap of Luxury wasnot better than the previous CTrelease, The Doctor. Without JB the'Trickster releases since have no or-iginality with what's his name backin the band. Sigh....."
2,jeez,"cccccc rate movie dont buy it even dont rent!! you dont need watching kind a movie waste your time, worst movie ever i seen. i shoud not buy this!"
2,Not what I expected,"When I got this I expected to see Glory Annen ( Felicity) in it. Instead it was the Koo Stark version. It was an OK movie, but as far as Koo Stark goes, I liked the Movie ""Emily"" better. It is an Ok rental, but I wouldn't buy it. It is rather tame and would be Rated ""R"" by todays standards, because of the Nudity and subject matter, and the Nudity is somewhat subdued. There are probably better versions of this story available."
4,"People, do your research first!","Since I'm a Montrealer (like LOE) I've been listening to them for a while. And people don't seem to realize that Lezzies on X is all about taking music from (not so) well known lesbian musicians and making dance tracks out of them. I think that they've done a GREAT job doing that. Whenever I listen to LOE I just have the GREATEST URGE to start dancing (which is bad since most of the time I'm actually on the bus or metro). I think LOE has done a great job with it. It's repetitive sure, but isn't that kinda the point?"
4,exactly what you are looking for,"Yes, there are a couple songs on this cd that just feel out of place or just wrong,,,but the rest of the cd is great. This is perfect music for working out, getting ready to go to the club, dancing in your room, driving in your car (or on the bus), or walking to work, it gets you going. so buy this cd if you been a lil' lazy lately and get your ass up and moving."
1,Clearly a terrible idea,"Lesbians on Ecstasy is, by all counts, one of the worst bands I heard this year. Their material is unoriginal and repetitive, which was evidenced by their lack of ability to motivate the crowd to listen, much less dance. The previous review compares them to Chicks on Speed, a far more entertaining group, if you are interested in this mini-genre. Although Lesbians on Ecstasy toured with Le Tigre this year, the two acts are from completely different worlds - the former is clearly more associated with Le Tigre's latest partnership with corporate demons Strummer-Universal and MTV.Don't fall for the catchy name or ""hip"" album art. There's nothing worthwhile behind the curtain."
3,"""The Short Story"" by Sean O'Faolain","I meant to put in FIVE STARS.Sean O'Faolain's book The Short Story is one of the very few excellent books on the craft of writing short stories.It is, alas, out of print. Mr Weeks, the long ago editor of The Atlantic Monthly, gave a copy of it to James Alan MacPherson, who later won the Pulitzer prize for his second short- story collection ""Elbow Room"".O'Faolain's book is an anthology of 7 short stories (Chekov, de Maupassant, Elizabeth Bowen, Hemingway & al.)and O'Faolain's half-dozen essays which are about general principles and also close readings of the anthologized stories.I wish some publishing house would reprint this book. I use it in my writing workshops in the MFA program at the University of Virginia."
3,Price?,"Amazon very quickly responded to my request to add this product to the Subscribe & Save program. However, I must agree with other reviewer about the price. We have been buying it at Walgreens for $15.99. Since both of my parents need this item and our budget is tight, the convenience of regular shipments does not outweigh the savings."
4,A great mummy adventure!,The best part was when Ahmed tried to get Gabe and Sari intothe tub of tar.It was awesome! Liked the sequel better.
4,The Mummy's Pyramid,I think this book was exciting especially when Gabe got lost and he thought that he was not alone. I recommend this book to those who want to learn about egyptology in an entertaining way.
3,"Nice plot,great story.Have an egyptian background.",The two main people of the story work together well.They needed each other.
1,"Boring, not scary, and dull","When I got this book at a library I thought it would be scary,and interesting but it was the opposite. It didn't have any exciting, or scary parts. It basicly didn't have any mummy stuff.I didn't even finish 3 4th of it because it was so boring. Once Iborrowed it again to finish it but it was a disapointment. Thisbook is really a mystery book(which I hate)not a scary book. Iwoudn't recomend anybody to read it. This is the most boring bookI've ever read. Gesundheit"
5,Mummies and pyramids,"Gabe is visiting his archaeologist uncle in Egypt. He's ecstatic when he is allowed to enter a pyramid. Then his cousin disappears and Gabe is alone in the dark labyrinth. Except he's not alone...This is a very nice story. Pyramids, mummies, curses... What's not to like?! Great stuff."
3,The curse of the Mummys tomb,"If you like Goose bumps books you will like The curse of themummys tomb. I think it has a lot of adventure and mystery in it.Igive it 3 *'s for mystery, it's a good book. Gabe went to Egypt for the summer and brought a mummy to life. I hope you read The curse of the mummys tomb."
4,A good buy.,"This is a soon-to-be dorm room stereo. It is attractive, pretty solidly put together and has a very nice sound with surprisingly good stereo separation. The CD player is also very good, and the FM tuner is well above average (actually more sensitive than the nice Bose system that won't be headed for the dorm). My only regret is that it doesn't come with a remote, but of course I knew that before I ordered."
2,short life span,"I love my Avent breast pump, and since I'm away from my baby at school all day, I needed to be able to pump in my car. I bought the car charger and it worked beautifully for about 3 weeks, and then stopped working. The pump still functions fine, but only on the indoor charger. It is frustrating to have to buy a new car charger already, and in the mean time I have to hand pump, which is totally inefficient. So I recommend the pump, but the car charger is a little lame."
4,Convenient.,This product really helps us to save time on road trips. I don't have to bump by hand (which the suction isn't strong at all.) A great buy!
3,Useful,"I liked having the flexiblity of pumpimg in the car, especially when I went out on dates with my hubby. It is not plesant when your breasts are full of milk and baby is not around to feed!"
4,Good for long trips,"This is a great device to have if you're going to be in the car awhile for a long trip. It also works great if you have to be out and about without your baby. So for those extended days of running errands, you can plug it into the cigarette lighter and keep going. For those long car rides, it's a lifesaver. It takes less time with more suction than the manual pump. I gave it four stars becasue it is quite a tight fit in the cigarette lighter and is difficult for me to get it in and out. However, it seems to be a little easier the more I use it. If you had to travel for work, this would be a great way to still continue to pump."
5,Very Functional,"I purchased this purse because I broke my foot and was on crutches and needed something easy and accessible. This purse is the most durable and functional purse I've purchased. It has a strap to go over the shoulder or a wristlet to carry as a clutch. The quality of the hardware is unbelievable. The color is perfect (not too bright or too orange but a wonderful red). The bag is large enough to handle my checkbook, pen, wallet, and phone. The inside of the purse has a few credit card slots on either side. I usually have a larger purse to hold everything - now that I'm off crutches, I've continued to use the purse as it holds just enough for a quick trip to the store."
3,the good and the bad...,"I bought this purse for a trip to Vegas - wanted something small and light weight and this seemed to fit the bill. I have 2 other harveys bags and really like both of them too. so first things first, I LOVE the color and texture!! I wish it was just a tiny bit larger. it is such a tight squeeze to get anything in it. I would make the sides of the purse a bit wider not the length or the width... just an extra 1/2"" would be really nice. Also the cross body shoulder strap is just a little too short so it doesn't sit quite right and its a little uncomfortable... One last thing -- the place where you attach the shoulder strap is on the back side of the purse, I feel it would be better balanced if the strap hooks were on the ends of the bag."
3,Jerome Russell Hair Thickener (Black),Ok product. It has the same results as the Top Coverage product but rubs off a lot easilier.
2,product review,"The black dye is very messy, not worth the hassle. The ingredients seem harsh for an already fragile scalp."
1,dont buy this bulls***,"Too dark, too runny, will ruin shirts and pillow cases. Makes hair feel like wool, and gets all over hands. So sorry I wasted a dime on product"
2,Not good,"I have used this product a lot in the past because I didn't know what else to use. I don't like the way it sprays. It comes out too strong. Also, it gets the surrounding area black from the excess spray."
2,Worst than before,"I used to use this for years before finding the expensive ones like Prothik, Fillmore etc. I knew this tend to rub easily and is no water proof, however now is worst. The can is different and the thing is the sames as the Jerome Russell Temporary Spray-In Natural Hightlights. This is only good if you want to have a spare in case the other one runs out or get clogged. For Emergency use only and in dry scenarios. No water, no sweat..."
1,Watch out!!,I bought this product to hide some bold spots. I then did some sit ups and the black from the hair dye ended up on my rug! I could not get it out!! I have to throw away the rug!! When I asked for a refund the company agreed but I have to pay shipping!!
4,The LIVE Slaughter album we've been waiting for!,This is the LIVE Slaughter album we've been waiting for! Captures the live essence of a Slaughter show. It should have been a double album.
4,That's my little Octopussy!,"I was pleased to get my hands on this reissue of a solid John Barry entery in the 007 series. The remastered cd sounds fantastic, though it does not include any bonus tracks. Also, it drops the qoutes from the film found on the first Rykodisk reissue. The score itself is a fine effort, though not as exciting as Barry's next two efforts (""A View to a Kill"" and ""The Living Daylights""). The real standout here is the love theme, ""That's My Little Octopussy,"" a nice orchestral arrangement of the pleasent theme song ""All Time High"" by Rita Coolidge. The best of the action cues is ""The Chase Bond Theme,"" elements of which Barry would incorporate into the next two, more action packed scores. If you're collecting the Bond score reissues, or even just the Barry albums, this is a no-brainer, especially if (like me) you missed the '97 Rykodisk album. Though I would have liked to have seen the score expanded with bonus tracks, ""Octopussy"" remains a fine album."
3,For Your Extra Tracks Only -The Lack Of,"After Diamonds Are Forever (which is my personal favorite John Barry Bond score), Barry's reportoire became more melodical with less of the hard edged horn sections but Barry almost never disapoints with the lush exotic sound that Octopussy has. My beef with this soundtrack is there are no extra musical tracks in it, the reason for this is the producer of the re-mastered library ofBond soundtracks had not enough budget allocated by the record company to include extra tracks on all the remastered Bond music, so therefore he picked the ones that he thought were most deserved to have extra tracks. Unfortunately, Octopussy was not one of the ones budgeted for extra tracks. Thank the stars above that Diamonds are Forever was allocated extra tracks, but alas, it was not to be for Octopussy."
3,"Like Father, Like Son?","Perhaps my expectations were too high, being a long-time fan of the senior Mr. Fulghum, but I found this book to be a bit lacking in every way. It was a fairly enjoyable read, full of short tales that try to touch the heart. To me the author seems to be trying too hard to match his fathers' writing style, making the book come across as a Fulghum wannabe rather than the work of an independant author. There is a slight flavor of Dave Barry-ish wit, which seems to have been covered up in favor of attempting the nostalgic. I'd like to see this author write a book without trying to imitate his father--my guess is that it would be a fine read!"
4,A good mix of content,"Car Craft has a nice mix of content - some high end feature cars, low buck tech tips and even some humor. They cover old engines, new engines and older cars, but what stops them from hitting five stars is the lack of new platform content. 60s and 70s iron is rare and expensive, and if you are looking for ways cars not from that era, there is precious little car content. Newer engine information is present in spades, and there is still plenty of excellent general technical advice that all enthusiasts will appreciate, so it is worth the subscription price. Finally, Car Craft brings some irreverence that is sets it apart from other publications and helps keep it light and fun."
2,Customer Service Doesn't pay attention to address details,It takes entirely too long for a person to receive their first subscription and once the address was entered specifically the magazine company omitted the entire address.This is frustrating since I placed his order on July 4th and it's now August 15th.I had too many disappointing experiences ordering from Amazon.
1,bid head todd and th monsters,"recorded horrible voices did not match their mouth, like watching a foreign film i was very disappionted in this video"
4,Simple and efficeint,This software does what is needed. It is easy to use and not full of expensive traps like Quick Books and others.
3,oops discontinued product as of 12/31/04,Unless you need three weeks of payroll this program will not be much help. The customer service at accpac is very helpful so do not read this as a slam against the product line which sounds very good.
3,average,"This is basically a get what you pay for item. ""Fair"" on being scratch resistant, flexes in the oven 2 out of the 4 times I've used it."
2,not as advertised -,"Size is actually 17.5"" by 12"" - not as listed in product description.Listed as heavy duty - this is a light middleweight pan at best.I worked for Ekco-Glaco remanufacturing industrial baking pans for three years and also worked for Satan's cookie baker - Mrs. Fields for two years - I know the difference."
1,Warping bakeware,This sheet has warped after just 2 times of normal use in the oven - I might have gotten a defective one - but has never seen anything like this happen before - coating is good and stable but warped and not flat anymore - would definetely choose a different brand next time.
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered a small cookie sheet for the toaster oven, part of a set.received one large cookie sheet.very disappointed."
2,Not as shown,"Sorry, the product was not a cookie pan, but it was a muffin pan. And very small. Totally not as pictured. I think it had 9 recessed cups in it for (very small) muffins. I sent it back, sorry!"
2,Not as expected,"The non-stick coating on this pan isn't. That is, the coating fails to release baked-on drippings from meats baked on a rack placed in this pan. With some urging, the bulk of the drippings comes off, but permanent dark spots remain. After a few washings, the coating at these spots begins to peel off. So the coating is not only ineffective, but fragile.In addition, the pan warps when heated, thus spilling greasy drippings on the oven floor. Apparently the pan was not heat-treated to relieve stresses once the metal was formed into the final shape of the pan.Perhaps this pan would be OK if it were just used to bake cookies. It is of heavy construction to distribute heat evenly. But for my uses it is unsatisfactory, and very short-lived."
2,not the quality I wanted,"I bake a lot, so I'm kind of picky about the sheets I use. I thought these were the thicker, higher quality sheets from Baker's Secret that I am used to. They are not. They are very thin and as a result you don't get the consistency in any cookies you are trying to make. The nice thing about them is the size. Two can fit on the same oven rack while still allowing the oven door to close. These aren't garbage by any means. Baker's Secret makes solid stuff. But if you're looking for HIGH quality sheets, spend more on something else."
4,Good Nonstick Baking Pan And A Great Value,"I needed a small baking pan for miscellaneous oven duties, so I bought this one, which is approximately 10"" by 13"". I don't actually use the pan for cookies, but do use it for a host of other things such as baking chicken or vegetables, and have found it to be sturdy and easy to clean. I don't use metal utensils with it and have thus far not experienced any serious scratching issues; being dishwasher safe was also vital for me, and it has always come out of the dishwasher clean.This pan is more than adequate for typical household use, and is an excellent value."
3,Not Exactly As Pictured,"This is the ""new and improved"" version of this pan. The picture that Amazon shows was the original.What's the difference?The bottom of this pan is raised slightly, (probably to prevent the warping that other reviews have mentioned.) This creates a small ridge on the bottom around the inside edge of the pan. So the flat bottom inside the ridges is a useable surface area of about 9 by 14 inches, not 15-1/4 by 10-1/4 inches."
3,No longer non-stick,"I only use this pan for baking hand-cut fries every once in awhile since about 10 months ago. I noticed that the fries were starting to stick, so I started using more oil and reducing cooking time. But that's not the problem. The surface of the pan is no longer nonstick. I'll look around for a different pan next time and spend a little extra to get better quality. (Later that day) I've been reading about what to do, and it seems that parchment paper or a silpat are probably the way to go. So, I won't buy another pan, but instead get a silpat too."
4,At Last!,"At last! This is the definitive reissue of the fantastic soundtrack to the hugely popular Bud Spencer & Terence Hill western Lo Chiamavano Trinità (AKA They Call Me Trinity or My Name Is Trinity).What we get is the 13 tracks from the original 70s LP along with 16 previously unreleased tracks which comprise of alternate takes of the original album tracks and some great groovy/lounge music that was recorded, but ultimately rejected by the movie's producers and never used in the final cut of the movie.Franco Micalizzi does a great score here for Italian western music. A must for your collection.You also get a 8 page color booklet containing background notes, synopsis, color movie stills and original poster art."
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR FROM THIS COMPANY,"Unless you would like to throw your money away, don't purchase this product. I purchased one in June. It came broken. We figured it out in Septemeber. It took until Thanksgiving to have it looked at. Past Easter, they still haven't replaced the product because every time I call they either have no record of my last call, or have discovered some additional information they need from me in order to process a replacement. Buy anything else from anyone else, but don't buy this."
4,At your fingertips,"Everything for Fall: An Early Childhood Curriculum Activity Book has quick organizational tips and activities at your fingertips. It offers suggestions for center-based instruction with related themes in each area. The activities such as songs, dramatic play, art, and manipulatives are simple and age appropriate for young children. Hands-on learning is also very evident. As most teachers hope to spend more actual time working with their students instead of planning, this book is a wonderful resource and time saver."
5,Best of the Husband Hunters stories!,"Maxie must marry if she wants to inherit the 1 million dollars left to her by her aunt. Angelos Petronides has waited 3 years to have Maxie as his mistress. But Angelos soon finds out that marriage is the only way that Maxie will ever be his. Of all three of the husband hunters books this was the best one, even though as usual I felt like slapping the hero several times for his outdated thinking."
3,A Romance Junkie,"Angelos is the super rich, handsome, sexy Greek who wants Maxie in his bed at all cost. In fact he waits to get her in his bed for three long years. Maxie is what I would characterize as the dumb, blonde model with a disability. She's also that annoying person who's married to the boss and is a total bitch to the staff. She walks in on meetings to tell him off, without thought to what would happen to the poor secretary. I liked Angelos character well enough but Maxie argued about everything. It got really tedious towards the end because she's really dumb. A Blind man could have realized what Angelos was doing, but not her. I don't want to tell you the story and all things said it was ok. I give it three stars and since you know this author's writing is great, you will finish it without throwing it across the room."
3,A bit excess in the comments,"Definitely I don't agree that the song ""Living daylights"" is one the best song of James Bond's themes, A-ha is a pop group with a very few original sound, and irritating in abuse of synthesizer, so it is the fanatics of the music of the 80's do not consider them as a musical icon of the decade. The best are the instrumental tracks, everything a sucessfull of John Barry and the song ""If there was a man"" of The Pretenders, a song that would must be included in any recopilation of best James Bond themes"
1,Totally ineffective.,This product did absolutely nothing. I put some of the granules out as directed and was outside with my dog a few hours later. She went right over and took a leak on it. She did not even notice or give a second sniff of the grass in the area. Would note recommend this at all.
5,One of my favorites,"One of my favorite books since 1995. The only criticism I ever heard of Jim's work is that he brilliantly presented the problems inherent in the hierarchical view of the world, he didn't offer solutions. Admitting this, he reviewed my last book in its original manuscript form, and commended me for doing just that. Jim has been an inspiration for me as a writer.-Don Lutz, author"
1,"Tiki ""TORTURE""",We got this for our 5YO son's birthday. It took us about two hours to assemble. Once assembled we found that it does not work all that great. It is constantly coming apart. The only fun thing about it is the sound effects. We seriously thought about using super glue to make the pieces stay together . I would not recommend this for any child - it is quite frustrating for my 5YO and for me.
2,Disappointed!,Don't bother with this toy. It will not stay together and is very flimsy. We were very disappointed that we wasted our money on it.
2,Not a good choice,This toy is not very durable. Falls apart when they are playing with it nicely. I think Hero City is (rocket park) a much better choice.
4,Fun for your Hot Wheels fan,"My son received this set for his birthday. He really likes it since he has the other Lava Land sets that attach to this one. He hooks them all together for a big Hot Wheels city. The biggest complaint I have is that there are a few pieces that just don't stay together. My son usually needs help getting it put back together when the pieces come apart. It doesn't really seem to bother him though. I think if your child loves Hot Wheels, it's hard to go wrong with this set."
1,Breaks easily,This toy is a piece of garbage in my opinion...I bought this for my son and it broke after one hour of use. The parts easily come apart and some of the things don't even work properly.
3,Fun track but not durable!,"My son LOVED this when it was together..It was WAY cool for the car to shoot through the wheel of fireUnfortunately once it fell apart enough times, that I just couldn't put it back together anymore. After that, I was never really able to put it back togehter. WEll once but it took me forever and eventually key pieces went missing I guess because I never could piece it back together.My son got like 3 or 4 other tracks WITH this one and they all hooked toghether, which was neat. To bad this one was never really stable."
4,Very open-minded and you have to use your imagination,"I'm not sure as to the age group the author is trying to gear towards, but I think it is a very good book for the age 8 up to adults. Adults can learn something from this book as well. I love the imagery of the little girl. I like how the author demonstrated that our children do hear and understand how we as adults feel even if they don't understand verbally they do understand body communication. I believe this was the authors first book and I think she is off to a good start."
2,I Eat at Mommy's,I was so repelled by the art work in this book that I returned it without reading it! I think lots of children would find the people's faces scary. I did!
1,not worth buying it! bad book!,"(nursing at keyboard)i don't know how the author could get aknowledgement from some LLLI executive editor... i don't see why she writes ""dear reader, this book is meant to evoke positive feelings and responses (...) and then on p16 of the story ""(...) it was her mother standing by the full-length mirror. she had a sad look on her face and was muttering. (...) ""look what the pregnancy and nursing have done to me. i feel yucky. my body is mushy like bubble gum and my breast are shaped like bananas""i mean ? what's that?... and the pictures are awful...i think anna e. bradley-mcbeth is lucky because her brother george bradley III is an editor (i think, it's the only reason why this book is on the market!)this book is definitely not a ""pro breastfeeding book"" (in my opinion)i'm going to donate it to my local library so that other mothers like me won't have to buy it if they want to read it."
1,JUNK TV,This TV broke after like 2 years. The cost to fix it was more than the TV was worth. Get a DLP or LCD TV instead.
1,My Kid Loved It,Very good book about bugs that kids can keep. My son loved it and before the week was out was going around looking a bugs and telling me what they were. It's a great text for kids of reading age who want to know more about bugs and how to keep them alive so that they can study them.
3,It's Okay,I really thought I was getting a good deal. I believe I did. However I have used the pan once to broil a steak and I can't get the top of the pan completely clean. Looks like it is permanently stained.
5,Excelente,I like it so much to cook more easy with the oven and les fat It has a Good size and itvs very usefull
3,Slightly damaged.,"I received this product in a timely manner and it was exactly what I expected. However, after I unwrapped it to wash, I noticed the pan portion was slightly bent out of shape. It's still useable, so I kept it."
3,Kuhn's self-serving account of his years as MLB Commissioner,"Plainly, Mr. Kuhn would prefer that his official version of events in baseball from the late 60s into the 80s prevail, despite the popular notion that he was overdrawn at the clue bank during much of that period. His account of labor negotations during his tenure conflicts in many respects with the published accounts of Marvin Miller (the players union representative) and (more objectively) with the account set forth in LORDS OF THE REALM (written by a WSJ reporter). Mr. Kuhn's attempt to repaint his missteps as leadership is certainly understandable, and the book is interesting as a historical document, but bring your grain of salt -- or maybe the whole shaker."
4,A textbook for the BASIC programming language,"This is a book written for enthusiasts rather than the average computer user. The book was published back in 1986, so the average user today will not use BASIC. If you have an old computer and wish to learn this language, this will help.The good thing about this book is that it has questions and quizzes to test your knowledge. At the end of each chapter are a summary, a glossary, questions to aid understanding (with some of the answers in the back of the book), and a quick quiz. The quick quiz answers are at the end of each chapter also. Of these, some simply give the correct answer, whereas others explain why a particular answer is correct.Since this is a programming language not taught much anymore, the average users would not always understand this text. If you are an enthusiast and still use your Apple IIe or Radio Shack TRS-80, then this book will be usable."
2,CERTAINLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY,This toy is tiny and made cheap. It should have been $3.00 instead of $11.00. My two 4yr olds girls took the 3 hello kitties and used them in the Twin Time Doll house as pets and tossed the Hello Kitty house aside.
3,Hello Kitty Carry along mini doll house,My daughter loves it. She plays it a lot. I bought it two years ago and it costs me $8.00. I could not believe that some people wants to sell it for over $80.00. I think it s very foolish! That toy is not very good. I think it s worth less than $10.00!!!I have no respect for people who are selling more then $70.00!
2,I cannot believe the price,"[...] We have this and my daughter enjoys the little kitties that came with it, but the house falls apart and the furniture is too small and doesn't really fit the figures. This toy is literally about the size of a large can of soup."
4,Are you kidding me?,"I nearly passed out when there was an $80 price on this!! I bought 2 for our granddaughters about 9 years ago, & paid maybe, $8 each! They loved them & we still have them. That price is Ridiculous!! The house fits in the palm of my hand!! Good grief!"
3,"Fun, but not so durable","My daughter enjoys this toy, but the wall and roof that open come off very easily, and she's not able to put them back together herself. Also the pieces are TINY, so they will likely be lost soon. But anything Hello Kitty makes her happy."
3,It's a nice doll house but everything is too small,"It's a nice doll house. However,the dolls and furniture are too small. It's not easy to pick up them and put in doll house. The space in doll house are too small."
4,Sieko watch,"Nice watch. Been a while since I had an ""automatic"" vice ""electrical"" watch, but no issues. I will be interested in how long this very nice canvas strap keeps clean. A great deal on a very good watch."
2,Dissapointing,"I've owned several Seiko watches over the years and this is the first one that really dissapointed me. I liked the looks and the fact that it was self winding, so I bought it. Doesn't take long for for the leather strip surrounding the clasp holes to deteriorate and become discolored which makes the appearance quite unattractive. More importantly, it doesn't keep accurate time. It gains about two minutes a day. I can only guess that this is because the self winding mechanism doesn't function properly."
1,Timeless,"I liked the way the watched look on the screen and that is why I bought it.Unfortunatley, the watch did not work upon receipt. It stopped frequently, and randomly the first 12 hours. The watch had been well wound. The limited instruction set, properly and dutifully followed. I am waiting on verification of refund. I do not want to and cannot generalize on my experience regarding this item. I only register my experience, and therefore the title of my review.A. L"
4,Seiko 5 rocks!!,"This is an excellent product from Seiko.Pros:1) Legible dial where numbers are clearly laid out in WWII bomber format.2) Luminous markers hold light well3) Automatic, may not be as accurate as a quartz watch but one can certainly appreciate the continuous sweep of the second hand and the exhibition display.4) Nato Style nylon strap is comfortable and does its job, although i have plans to replace it with a calfskin brown strap as i am suspecting some threading to occur within 3 to 4 months time.5) DAY and DATE, often see one or the other but makes the watch much more useful with both of them.Cons: NONEIm enjoying this watch and might plan to start a collection."
2,doesn't last forever,I have had this wrist watch for less than 2 years and it stopped working. I contacted the vendor and received no response. I am both disappointed in the vendor and the product. I expect more from a Seiko.......or is it.
2,Requires lots of exercise to keep it running.,"I received mine early in February. It would stop two or three times a day despite 'exercising' it. Sent it back to the service center and although it will still go to sleep during normal wearing, it will stay awake if I 'exercise' it by doing forceful arm movements until it is fully wound (I can hear the winding mechanism at work).I've had Seiko self winding watches since the early '60s when I was a soldier in the Far East. This behavior is not typical of the breed. I'm quite disappointed in the purchase.Added later on. If I wear the watch on my dominant wrist, then it stays wound. That is not as it should be as I'm a reasonably active person."
3,Repeat of info I've read before,"To an experienced teacher, this offers not much new in the way of information or ideas. To a student learning about preschoolers and how to work with them, it offers solid information in a usable way."
4,Good product but not excited over it,"Overall this is a good product. It produces rich, full sounds when the music is processed through its effects processor. The unit is mostly plastic, but it is well-built though you won't get that sturdy feel. The remote control is disappointing. It does not include a power button. This limits its usefulness since I have to get up and turn on/off the unit manually. The product description should have mentioned this."
5,Great Book! Easy and informative.,This is the first book I've picked up that actually tells you what you need to know without leaving things out. It makes learning easy and fast. I'm finally getting a handle on using OS X since purchasing this book. And so are my friends!
2,Does not answer all my questions,"Some would say that no manual can answer all the questions, but for 30 bucks, it should come close. Mac's are great machines, but Apple can't seem fit to include even the barest user manual at purchase. For almost 2 grand, this is a major omission. William's book showed promise, but as a novice user, I found it quite lacking. There's nothing included that spells out what to do when things don't work well, and Apple's in the same boat as Microsoft--it don't always work well. More troubleshooting would be helpful. (ie: what's a Fetch error. Had to call Apple on that one.) Too many examples to write about in this short space. Her visual example of the screen does not match what's on my flat-panel with OSX and that's frustrating. I recommend trying someone else's book if you're new to Macintosh. Better yet, write Apple and let them know they need to publish a good user manual for novices or PC switchers if they want to keep their market share."
2,Only buy if you are an absolute beginner,"If you are an absolute beginner with Mac Os X and really NEED to habe a book by your side then this might be the book for you. Otherwise is not a little book at all, is huge, but it is so because it goes through basic things with endless descriptions and screen captions. Things that could be explained in just 2 pages in this book go on for 6.Besides that I really need some sense of humour on the book (that's what I liked about Christopher Breen's Mac 911)"
5,Not of this World,Bought this book for a friend who is interested in this subject matter. She could never find any of his books locally so I order them forher.
5,She is Hilarious!,"Glad we are able to purchase Stateside! If you enjoy British comedy such as Absolutely Fabulous, Little Britian or French & Saunders, then get this DVD!"
3,nice smooth jazz album,"The order was filled quickly. I didn't know what to expect from this cd, was just browsing around, looking at music"
4,A useful translation,"To be honest, I wasn't looking for commentary on these two books when I purchsed this title. I'm glad I bought it, though."
2,Pen Looks Good but converter missing,I bought pen gift for my son in collage. He received on time but found converter missing in box. This was an unpleasant feeling while receiving a gift. I ask here to Amazon for providing either a converter of this pen or replace complete package having a converter.
1,Disappointed Trial---No Converter Inside!,"This is my first time shopping at Amazon, all because I went to US for short visit without bringing a signature pen. The pen was shipped to one of my friends in the US. When my friend gave the package to me, I opened it with big surprise---There was no converter in the pen, with only two refills in the paper package!!! The pen was full of finger prints. So I strongly guess this pen was unsealed by someone else, and the converter was left behind. When I received the pen, I had no time return it, cause I have to leave. So I had to bring this no-use pen with me. The pen now was left gathering dust in my desk. After all, it's a bad experience with Amazon!"
4,Lovely Fountain Pen,"The Townsend Medalist is a beautiful fine writing instrument-lovely to hold and to look at, it also delivers a strong, comfortable glide whilst writing. It skips ever so slightly every now and then, but perhaps I should rinse the nib and see if that eliminates this admittedly negligible problem. This is a lot of fountain pen for the price, and is as nice or nicer than more expensive pens. I recommend it unreservedly."
5,"Cross Townsend, Medalist, Fountain Pen!!!","Great Pen!!! Had a MontBlanc, broke and tried to get it repaired, the cost was off the chart. Bought the Cross for the size, weight, and warranty. Fits the bill!!!"
2,Flimsy,"Not what was expected. The cover is colored wax with a nice design but it's wax not glass, very dangerous if the candle should melt the cover."
4,Adorable and Creative,"My son loves this new show and so do I! It is so imagianitive and fun. This book is very well made and clever and is much like the show (exept it lacks the great music!). The music on that show is really good, I have to mention. I have the cd and we listen to it in our car (along with our Dragon Tales CD's) and these make listening to kids music tolerable. I find I can't stop myself from singing along!Any kid 5 and under would like this book."
3,not the kid pleaser i hoped for,"My cousins, who love to watch The Backyardigans, were not as happy with this soundtrack as I hoped. I think it's because they didn't recognize a lot of the songs. I need to get them to listen to it more and it may grow on them."
4,"Great CD, but don't buy it for the bonus video",My 15 month old really enjoys the CD and sings along with parts. I was disappointed however that I could not access the bonus video track. I tried using both my DVD player and my computer.
3,A Bit Disapointed,"I pre-ordered this cd without knowing which songs would be on it because afterall, its the Backyardigans - the cd has got to be a hit. Once I listened to it, I was a bit disappointed with the track selection. It seems most of the tracks were selected to entertain the adult fans (the music itself is great), but as far as including the ""fun"" songs, they could have done better. Also, I don't find the sound quality to be very good. This cd is nothing like the Dora the Explorer soundtrack."
5,The Best Family CD Ever,"This CD is sung by the original kids, just some of the songs do not have the speaking parts as it appears on the show. My kids (3 and 11) love the variety of music styles and we are always dancing in the car when it's on. I have had the CD for at least 3 months and it is the only thing we listen to in the car and you can always se us clapping along with the ""questing"" song. You will not regret this purchase."
5,Singing and dancing with the backyardigans,I bought the Cd to my grandson's first year niver party. He loves watch the Backyardigans on tv. When I first heard the CD I loved it. My grandson and the children had lot of fun singing and dancing with this CD lovely songs.
4,Love it!,"My kids are complaining because I keep this CD in my car and won't let them have it back! The songs are very catchy, cute, infectious, and they dare you not to sing along! The only reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is the omission of the ""Ridin' the Range"" song from the cowboy episode. How COULD they leave that one off???"
4,Sing along with the Backyardigans,Fun Cd to sing along with the Backyardigan songs my daughter and I know all too well.
4,Sing along in the car,"My two preschoolers love the Backyardigans show and this CD extends the fun and helps them memorize the cute songs featured on the program. Some of the songs are a little slow but the up-tempo numbers more than make up for them. A great introduction to different styles of music, from hip-hop to reggae."
5,Can I give it more than 5 stars?,"I bought this item for my 4 y.o. son, soon after he discovered the show on Nick Jr. Now, it is the only CD allowed to play in my car!! He goes around the house singing the songs, I think he is convinced he is Pablo the penguin, but the thing that is great is that my husband and I also really enjoy the music on this CD. So many of the kid's CDs are so repetitive (and quite frankyly annoying after a while) but, in spite of hearing these songs EVERYDAY, I still enjoy them and even find myself singing them when my son isn't around. I can't give this CD a higher recommendation, whether your child watches the show or not...get this CD."
3,Not Too Shabby...,"I must admit this isn't the best album. I actually bought it a year ago and, initially, i didn't like it very much. It just seemed really bland and lacked that special something to make it great. Now that i am revisiting it, i am finding alot more to enjoy. Holland plays a brand of pop-rock that crosses the line into emo on occasion, but always lifts my spirits with the great, lush melodies. The lyrics aren't very deep, but they fair well with the kind of music that is played and the singer's voice. I wouldn'd reccomend rushing out to pick this up, but its a good treat to have once and a while on that lonely day where you just need to feel good."
1,not hollAnd.,just fyi. this isn't the same hollAndthat has been putting out records ondarla/pulCec for the past few years...wish i'd been warned.
2,Bland Dutchmen,"Now, I won't go as far as saying Photographs & Tidalwaves is a terrible album. But plain and simple, it's boring. I would hardly compare Holland to The Elms (as far as musical talent goes). Also, I really see very LITTLE emotion in the singer's voice. No real range. No depth. Not BAD mind you- just not GOOD. Also lyrics are less than powerful,and guitar, drums and keys are forgettable at best. Don't waste your money. Buy The Elms ""The Big Surprise"" and just skip the first track, or get ""Interventions & Lullabies"" by The Format and enjoy every moment of it."
1,Unoriginal garbage.,"I saw Holland open a while back and decided to check them out. Their music is frankly too boring to make it, and I strongly advise that you heed my more sober review of this album."
3,Just ok,Product was much smaller than i thought it would be.Product was over boffed to the point that much of the Detail was lost.
2,(yawn),"This book belongs to my very personal category of books I absolutely do not like without being able to point out what exactly is wrong in them.The plot is simple and straightforward, characterization consistent, the writing more than average, but as one page followed the other, I could never get involved, I could not relate with any character, I never suspended disbelief.Reading it was like listening to an old neighbour, a story not necessarily dull but pale because it does not really concern you.The story entirely lacks not only eroticism but even sensuality (do not be fooled by the nice cover, it has nothing to do with the content), which is quite rare in this subgenre.There is of course this continuos, everyday, a bit annoying ordinary pain about being forced to kill to survive.All in all it is a story as unappealing as the biological kind of vampirism described."
3,So-So,"I tried reading this ebook, but I could not get into it. I think it was the flow of the words."
3,not twilight by any stretch,"not your average vampire story. while not of the caliber of george r r martin's fevre dream, nor the first rice vampire, this story is decently-told and has more than a few twists and turns you aren't likely to see in your ""normal"" vamp story. worth reading at least once..."
1,big disappointment,"Although for some reason it doesn't say this on the website, this CD is by Rudy Brown and his orchestra playing Nino Rota film music. It is an elevator music version of Nino rota. In a word, terrible."
2,Disappointing.,"I really wanted my little shihtzu, Sheldon, to like this food but it was a no go here. He barely sniffed it and walked away. I loved the size of the cans as well as the impressive ingredient list. I do have to say that it didn't smell alot like chicken to me though so I understand him not even tasting it. Too bad though. I would have loved to add this to the very small list of foods he will eat."
3,Trouble opening the cans,"I don't know if anyone else has trouble with the pull-tabs on these Canidae cans but I sure do. The tab part is very flimsy and doesn't hold up well while trying to pull open the top. I have almost cut myself several times. End up having to pry the top off with a fork after the pull-top breaks off. Otherwise it's an acceptable product, although I do prefer Evangers. But Evangers has become more expensive for some reason."
4,Great price for Grain Free,"As our dogs eat Canidae canned (along with grain free dry), we are always looking for the best deals. Pleasantly surprised to see Amazon had this grain free cheaper than even the regular (non grain free) is priced at the store (if you can find them). Dogs like it fine (we mix it in with the dry in the pet bowls). A little smellier than the other types (most likely because of the fish- only reason for 4 stars) but the dogs don't mind at all."
2,Dog wont touch it,I bought this brand because I heard good things about it and I was comfortable with the ingredients that were list. When I tried to feed it to my dog he would not touch it and usually he is not a picky eater. This is not a negative review in any way against the product itself but just an FYI to other pet owners.
4,Superior dog food,"My dog has severe allergies, and I'm always looking for superior dog food to try on her. I ordered Canidae Lamb and Rice canned formula; she really loves it, and she's quite picky. It arrived quickly, and I'm very pleased, with both the service and the dog food."
1,Warning - Caused intestinal problems,"Not only did my little girl refuse to eat this food after the first time (and she eats most any cannned food) it caused rectal bleeding and upset stomach problems for her when I did try to mix it in with her usual food to get her to eat it. This is not something I've encountered before with any food I've given her and I was upset this happened. I'm going to (reluctantly) give it to someone else to try with a warning, but wanted others to be aware in case their pets had a reaction like mine. She was fine as soon as I stopped givng it to her. Hard to say what's wrong."
3,High quality food but...,"I didn't realize this food was ground up into a fine paste (rather than chunks), which my dog doesn't seem to like as much. It also smells pretty bad. That being said, it's high quality food which I have no concerns with."
2,All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged,"I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment. Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged."
5,Canidae Dog Food,"This is the dog food I had chosen for my 5 dogs,but until now,I did not find a good price. Thank you Amazon. My dogs love it."
5,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, QUALITY DOG FOOD!!!","I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!"
1,"Warning, Pet food recall ,canned food, untrustworthy company",WARNING !!!!! they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing
1,Cheap metal. :(,I wore this ring for a day and it looked like it had been through Vietnam. It fit well and looked awesome at first. The scuffs and dents are a little too distracting.
5,DIAMANTES DIAMANTES,"I LOVE DIAMONDS, IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR ME TO EVALUATE DIAMON GETS 5 DESCRIPTION 0."
4,Great bang for the buck!,"Got this for me teenage daughter, [low price]. Great sound, crisp, clear highs, good bass, nice seperation (for small boombox)and good volume, better than her Aiwa stack unit. Adults may prefer the more subdued styling of the AZ203517. A can't miss choice!"
2,Fun While It Lasted,"Bought this in November as a Christmas present for my 11 year old, so it was opened on Dec. 25. On July 4 (6 months and 9 days later), the CD player failed to detect that a disk was installed. It didn't take long to see that the laser lens inside the player was missing... it had popped out. I found it loose inside the bottom of the speaker case. I could not reinstall it, and it appears that the retention of that lens is simple friction against some side posts. Or possibly, another retention piece is missing and I can't find it. Compared to another brand CD player, the lens mounting is cheap, lightweight, and probably built by the lowest biding subcontractor for Phillips. In any case, it couldn't hold up to an 11 year old playing it outside with friends. So, if you are bedridden or similarly isolated such that this boom box will sit on a sturdy table and not be moved much, this is the unit for you. I gave it 2 stars instead of of only one because it does sound good when it plays."
5,BOOM BOOM BOOM,"What a sound this boombox makes. Especially if you first listen to any other boombox in any shop and than turn on this awesome piece. A very impressive bass and still high clarity for voice.If you like this agressive design, you will not be disappointed by the aggressive sound. Hear, hear Philips, good job, the best sound in this price category."
3,A good boom box with problems,"This ""boom box"" has a very nice sound for the money. The bass is deep and rich and the treble is well defined without being tinny. Whether the unit will pack enough punch to satisfy hard core rap enthusiasts is open to debate. The radio picks up weak stations with ease. It is perfect for my officeOn the minus side, the digital display is not illuminated and is extremely difficult to read in any light. The unit's remote control is a very cheesy affair, giving you only the barest minimum control over the unit's basic functions. You can't even turn the power on or off with the remote. What's up with that?Finally, the footprint of this unit is huge. Make sure you clear out a few feet of space for this baby."
4,Good sounding bass!!,"I got this from amazon..a little worried about buying a radio without hearing it. Well..I loved it! Good sound for the price! The remote was a good thing too. The only drawback to this radio is the the lcd display does not light up. It is kind of hard to see. Unless you are under a lot of light:( But, besides that I would say buy this radio if you want something that sounds good and is portable!!"
3,disapointed,"I purchased this item mid March, after 6-weeks of limited use in my office, the CD lid broke and CD player capabilities stopped.I am very disapointed! I would not reccoment this unit as this seems to be a common problem."
3,Not a shock,"The movie it's attractive until the half, with plenty of love scenes and sadistic ones, but it's not as shocking as other movies. The movie becomes very disgusting when J wants to be whipped and he wants to be dominated, that's very weird. The problem it's the voice off and the sudden changes of rythm, when things go right, suddenly the image it's distortionated or the colour changes. However you can see the movie with no problem, I can't consider it a porn movie."
4,Pretty good SM flick,"Those who are prudish, have only a taste for vanilla sex or sexually naive should find your entertainment elsewhere.The story line has that unresolved, vague emotional conclusion akin to ""A Death in Venice"" or ""Lolita."" The early part of the movie breaks the fourth wall which may be the director's attempt to cushion the audience to the subject matter. The more I think about it the more this seems like a lack of conviction. The movie would have been under your skin more if this trick was done away with. For those in The Scene, there is some hot impact play, switching, and one scat scene, done with mostly dialog. ""The cutest SM movie ever"" is not a far-fetch tagline."
4,"Portrait of an intense, obessessive relationship","This, to me, felt like somewhat of a cross between ""Lolita"" and ""In the Realm of the Senses"". The sex and SM scenes are hot, mostly: there were a few technical details that broke the illusion. To see the descent of the couple into an alternate reality of their own making was chilling."
4,Typical Korean Movie,"The first half of the movie is very interesting in what is or not acceptable in modern day social rules, then it turn somewhat sensual in it's fetish and finally the last third of the movie was hard to watch due to the obsessive behavior that just goes sideways.Product was fine, subtitles pretty accurate. Not for children under 18 that's for sure!!!"
4,Lies,"This was a very bold and erotic movie. I see that the Koreans are becoming much more imaginative in this genre. The thing I like about Asian Movies, is there unpredictability, and this fell into that category. Tony"
1,Lies,"Lies is the correct title for this movie. It's full of lies, they lied when they said it was good. They lied when they said it was erotic. Don't waste your time with this one. The whole movie consists of beating each other with a stick. Even this is shown in the most non-erotic way possible."
2,Hereke and Kayseri,I expected something more comprehensive though it gives a basic level of introduction to Turkish silk carpets in pictures only. A more formal approach of specific information of the region and techniques would have been benefitial for those who are interested
5,"Awesome, Probably the best Yu-gi-oh! Card pzck ever","This pack includes 3 booster packs of Invasion of Chaos, the latest booster pack series, plus a old secret rare from a pack that is now hard to find. It saves money from buying 3 seperate packs, and REALLY saves money from buying the secret rare. The secret rare cards you can get in these are:Magic CylinderGemini ElfLava GolemRing of DestructionI gave this semi-high educational value because you have to calculate math while dueling, but I gave it low durability because the cards get beaten up easily. Good luck with these!"
5,Ha ha!,"Ha ha! That's some of the funniest stuff I've read in a long time. I was just listening to this and decided to look up the specifics. When I found Mike's review I nearly fell out of my chair. The best part was the ""First the good news"" after he totally disses it. Nice touch.Readers, Mike's review is obviously a joke. Everyone sounds great on this. If you're a fan of any of these players you won't be disappointed.Mike, on the off chance that you're serious... well, let's not go there."
1,You'd think that getting Mcaffe would protect your computer....,"I just bought the internet security suite version 8.0 last month January. You'd would think that getting Mcaffe would protect your computer, but it doesn't. Infact it made things worse.Immediately I installed it, my computer could not connect to the internet. Then i tried to unistall it, but it refused to remove. Now, my computer is damaged.Just yestersday, i put in a cd to listen to music. But guess what? There was no sound coming out of it. I have had his computer for about 3 years and not had this problem before.I guess Mcaffe is detoriorating with its new products.Next time, I would listen to my father and get a Norton version instead.MY ADVICE FOR YOU IS NOT TO PURCHASE Mcaffe internet security suite at all. But if you do, be prepared to experience problems and not get the value of what you paid for."
1,Don't go for McAfee Hype-Purchase from Amazon!,"I received email notifying me that my subscription was about to expire. So,I clicked on the ""Buy Now"" button next to ""At special discount pricing for loyal McAfee customers like yourself!"" ((...)) After checking around, I found that I was so special to McAfee that with an extra two bucks, I could purchase TWO copies of the product from Amazon! -- I understand volume pricing, but this is ridiculous. BUY AT AMAZON! (I have absolutely no connection with Amazon.)"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - IT IS A DISASTER!!,"McAfee should never have released this Security Suite. It would not even make for a good beta release. I did the upgrade, lost my networking ability. So I upgraded to the total Protection package. Then I lost my ability to print on my network printer. McAfee was ZERO help. Thier Tech support advised me to uncheck each box in McAfee until I could discover what part of the program was causing the problem. Did that and never discovered the problem. It is somewhere in the spooler I would think as the printer would only print the top 1 or 2 inches of a page and then eject the page. I have been a loyal McAfee customer for 20 years but am now looking for a new Security Company. Oh and by the way, I heard on the news that this program leaves your computer open to attack, but McAfee is working on a fix. Boy that should make you feel better."
1,Buyer beware!!,"This product causes Visual Studio to crash. If you are a software developer don't install this product. It will cause you hours of frustration and downtime.Please go to Mcafee's website and browse their support forums!This is a horrible product.This product prevents Visual Studio 2005 from opening any web projects. It also causes problems with iTunes, SQL Server 2000/2005 and a host of other applications. It also has a severe performance impact on most computer systems. There are many angry subscribers who were pushed this product as an upgrade to ISS 7, who now have unusable computers. Because Mcafee won't provide a path to downgrade to the previous version, a users only option is to uninstall the product. Unfortunately for subscribers receiving an upgrade, a refund is not possible. Mcafee is weaseling out of refunding subscribers money by enforcing their 30 day return policy. This is in-spite of the fact it is only the brand upgrade forced on everyone that is causing problems."
1,"Do not buy, don't even accept it for free","Much of what you read in the other reviews should convince you already to not buy this product, or any McAfee product. Technical issues aside, the fact McAfee forces their own pop-ups onto your screen (they pop up from the lower right of your taskbar) is quite the irony. I have security so I don't get pop-ups. Frustratingly, there is no way to override the pop-up except uninstalling the product - shocking - more like adware than a friendly good product. The values of McAfee show they do not have your interests at heart. Go with Norton, or perhaps a guru has a better solution than either of these mainstream companies."
3,"Good, but not great.","I had the McAfee Virus Scan 2005 and decided to upgrade to the Internet Security Suite 2006. Good, but not impressed by it. The updates for the Privacy option are too often and require every time a reboot of your PC."
1,Worse than useless! Do NOT buy this software!,"I have nothing good to say about this package. Not only will this software bog down even the fastest computer to a snail's pace, what's worse is that shortly after purchasing this brand new, factory sealed software, I am now informed that my ""subscription has expired,"" and that I must pay a substantial fee for new virus definitions! I purchased this software three weeks ago!And good luck contacting their so-called ""Customer Service."" McAfee's idea of customer service is to list dozens of FAQs, none of which are likely to actually address your particular situation, and then make sure there is no possible way to phone them with questions.I sincerely believe McAfee has committed an act of felony fraud in grossly misrepresenting this product. Anyone care to join me in a class action suit against McAfee?"
1,Never Buying McAfee Again!,"I have the 2005 version of this software. It intalled OK but had to be reinstalled several times over a year and made things slower than I liked. But then I got the dreaded ""Black M""The red M icon on the taskbar turned black and said my antivirus protection was disabled, while the main Security Center screen showed it was OK.After about 45 minutes on a chat with India, they had me run a test program that informed me I had ""Black M"" and it was probably a virus!The AV program couldn't find it so now I am supposed to ""upgrade my problem ticket"", with no information on how to do that.I dread talking to ""support"" for another few hours, so I am trying PC-Cillin.I used to use Norton, back in the good old days when things worked, but now it is too big and bloated with no support and lots of bugs too."
2,Product did not work well,This particular product did not do it's job very well. My system ended up with viruses and all other sorts of bugs.
1,This product is AWFUL.,"I have had earlier versions of this product which worked OK (except the SPAM blocker was over zealous). I bought the upgrade on CD and after TWO months I get an expiration message. This is where it gets to be a nightmare. I have spent HOURS with McAfee support who have had me download programs aimed to clean out remnants of older versions and deleting lines from the registry. Literally hours and hours later, dozens of re-boots, working in Windows SAFE mode it still won't work. This product is a waste of money and a waste of time. I am looking into a class action suit. Any one want to join?"
1,Turned my computer into a $1500 Paperweight!,"Do NOT buy this Product!!!I urge you not to subject yourself to the pure misery and lost time I have incurred due to this product. I could not even get this product to install correctly. I procured the wonderful (sarcasim implied) online ""free"" help from McAfee who proceed to guide me into destroying my machines operability by changing values on my registry. Then, I could not receive anymore help from them because my computer crashed and unless you want to pay an exorbitant price you have to use there online chat help!I has taken days from my life to fix the problem they caused!!I wish I had read the other predominately negative reviews of this product before buying and STAYED AWAY FROM IT!"
1,Error after error after error.... on going cycle,"I installed McAffe thinking that it would do better than the freebie spyware and adware scanners you can get online. Was I wrong! This program causes all sorts of problems.Not only does it slow down you system, but I also had a problem with the software as it would continually cause errors when I tried to update it. Your computer start up will be as slow as a snail after this as well.Wouldnt recommend to my worse enemy..."
2,Don't Buy McAfee Internet Suite 8.1,"About three weeks after I purchased this software it suddenly, and with no reason, quit working. I first tried calling McAfee Tech Support but found that it was a toll call and quite expensive. I then tried their internet site. They have a tool called ""Internet Virtual Technician"" so I tried it.To my great surprise, it worked but the program is extremely slow and took four attempts and almost four hours to correct the problem.I am now shopping for an anti-virus program for my wife's computer and it certainly won't be this one."
1,Really really really really horrible,"Why would you use a product that causes your computer to perform at around 50 percent of its actual capabilities? I mean, are you REALLY that scared of a computer virus? Any protection offered by this program has to be weighed against the loss of performance. These programs will add a substantial amount of time to your boot up process, need to be updated constantly, and are generally just a pain in the rear to deal with. AVOID!"
1,Gave up on updates!,"Nice idea, but simply does not work. When I try to update it with the latest version, keeps giving me registration error. I already registered the product, but even though I can login from the McAfee website, I can not upgrade it using the product itself. Tired of communicating with the tech support. They had me reinstall, run XP in safe mode, and install scripts, none worked. I think, this is a premature product which was not extensively tested to catch the Christmas season. Especially naive users should be aware, it has been a nightmare for me as a CS MS."
2,Stupid,"Twenty years using computers, and this is the first virus scanner that doesn't allow me to tell it what drives it should scan. It's very obvious (to anyone with half a brain) that we might not want to scan all of them. In my case, the program ""hangs"" while scanning my .Mac iDrive. I don't need that drive scanned, but there's no way to tell the product a simple thing like that.Other than that, frankly, I've had zero problems."
1,Dreadful - do not buy,"This is just appalling with little effective support. I keep getting a win32 error after downloading from their website. Keep clear, Norton is a safer bet."
1,zero stars,protection; sure. it appears that most hackers and spyware companies have managed to crack mcafee and are able to install anything they want on your pc with this product.total waste of money. customer service - what a joke.
3,Burroughs??,"""In the violent burroughs of the 1930s New York"".I haven't watched this DVD yet...but here's what I noticed on the package.New York City is divided into 5 sections.Some places might call them counties, in New York we call them boroughs.This mis-spelling is on the DVD package and it appears no one at AMAZON bothered to proof-read this either."
2,"EHH, SO SO","Peter Falk's performance is the only reason to watch this film. It is supposed to take place in the thirties, but you only know that because they keep telling you so. There is nothing in the way the characters dress, talk, or act that says 1930s. None of the sets are dressed in a 1930s style. The film looks and feels like the early 1960s, which is when it was made. And the sixties is not my favorite era for films. I bought this because I saw the trailers and they looked really good, like a gritty, late '50s neo-noir. It isn't gritty and there's nothing noir about it, except maybe, visually, some of the scenes of Falk in jail. This film gave me some appreciation for Falks acting style, but other than that, it was a waste of two hours."
3,"ok, not thrilled","Though it was a decent historic account, I felt the film was a little flat. If not for Peter Falk, the film would've surely lost quality."
3,Two Interesting Films,"Nice noir look and feel, and some excellent performances--especially Peter Falk; but about halfway through, it becomes another film, different in style and viewpoint; and though both films are interesting, they never quite satisfactorily reconnect with each other."
3,More Inc. Than Murder,"Fete of DeathShot in documentary style, ""Murder, Inc."" is long on talk and short on action. For a movie concerning an association of hit men, it comes as an unwelcome surprise that there would be so little action, so few murders.This movie is based on an interesting true story in 1930s Brooklyn, but it lacks juice, and for a movie with the title ""Murder, Inc.,"" such a dearth is the kiss of death. When you see a film title with the word ""murder"" teamed with ""inc."" in it, it stands to reason that you would expect to see a raft of murders being committed on-screen. ""Murder, Inc.,"" which is a catchy title, is therefore misleading.What the film does have is a standout performance by Peter Falk as contract killer Abe Reles, which is spot on, and, for that reason alone, if for no other, it is worth watching.--Bryan Cassiday, author of ""Fete of Death"""
5,"Staggering piano playing, even by Richter's standards","What can I say? Two CDs-worth of previously unissued music from possibly the greatest pianist of the century at the height of his powers in some of his ideal repertoire AND IN EXCELLENT SOUND. Special higlights for me are the Liszt, especially ""Vallee d'Obermann"" and ""Au bord d'un source"", and above all ""Le Gibet"". Whew! I can't imagine a more haunting performance of this centerpiece of Ravel's ""Gaspard de la Nuit"" cycle. Why on earth didn't Richter record (or indeed play at all) the whole thing? He loved to tease us with the gaps in his repertoire, of course, but maybe even he couldn't see how to match the intensity he achieves in ""Le Gibet"" in the other two movements. What a loss....As well as hurrying to buy this set, I also recommend that you consider a Richter disk on Praga which includes more Liszt and Ravel, including fascinating comparison performances of ""Alborada del Gracioso"" and ""Valses nobles et sentimentales"
5,Perfect Replacement,Goblet was just as promised. I was replacing one I broke at a friend's house and was happy with this order. Arrived safely and on time.
2,S.E.I.U. Big Brother? Big Business? Big Rip Off?,"Somewhere between the poor grammar, improper punctuation and run-on sentences is a message, I am sure, with meaning and relevant information. Unfortunately, I could not find it. The author writes as though she is taking to her bowling or church club. For instances, ""and Rose did"", ""George was"", and ""Billy got a kick out of""..... Who are these people? The author really should have invested time and money into having people help her with this book. But all in all, she is to be credited for having the courage or expose SEIU."
3,Just Not Sure,"As a big fan of Diane Stein's books, I looked forward to this one with special interest. Having worked with the material for some time now, I cannot say with certainty whether the claims it makes are valid. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, perhaps I've missed something. I have garnered some insights and experienced a few serendipitous events, but on the whole I haven't had the profound transformation the material promises. Maybe there's no ""one size fits all"" route to self-healing. It would be helpful if Ms. Stein addressed the ""what if this doesn't work for you"" phenomenon, and offered suggestions for improving one's technique or addressing subconscious biases or whatever it might be that stands in the way. Ms. Stein is a very dedicated, experienced and compassionate healer and author. But despite my earnest efforts, I can't give this book an unequivocal thumbs-up, as much as I would like to."
1,A lot of Hindu philosophy and little tangible knowlege,"Despite the compelling title of this book, I got very little practical knowledge out of this book which I quickly returned.Here is an example of the book that I found to be a turn-off:Essential Energy Balancing offers ways to release pain by contacting helpful spirit guardians - the Lords of Karma.I appreciate a spiritual approach to psychology and holistic methodologies but this book has a very narrow religious focus and did not offer any accessible knowledge or advice."
4,A sound stratgy for achieving financial security. No excuses,Very good book for the many who are looking for a way to go from paycheck to paycheck to sanity.Couple these stratgies with some of the Wade Cook priniciples and Amway's continual residual income and the your achievements will only limited by your dreams
4,Nice little read,I liked this book even though it is somewhat dated. Gives a good feeling of the mood during the cold war and gives some good information on communism. Shows a side of J. Edgar Hoover that I never expected to see.
4,very satisfied,We were needing this item for a school project and we needed it quick but it came even quicker than we expected. The book was in very good condition. We couldn't be more satisfied with the results.
5,Masters of Decit,I am a concerned citizen and after reading this book realize more than ever that this country is headed at a very fast pace to socialism and on to communism. I can only hope that people read this and decide to stand up and want to help themselves rather than depend on the government for their necessities. God Bless America!
3,unusable,"Although this book arrived in time and w/out any physical ""blemishes"", the binding (glue) has deteriorated and the pages are falling out, therefore making the book unreadable..."
3,Ok speakers,Bought these for my vw bug and mounted them in a rear speaker shelf..They sound ok but not too much bass...they distort somewhat..not bad for the price..
3,The Farmer's Daughter: A Sunday in the Country,Very little nudity in this video compared to other videos by Rusty Nail Productions. I didn't like idea of the video person using railroad tracks as a location to film the model because it is a safety issue.
1,1 Inch slider doesn't slide,"I installed the Slipstick CB255 I inch sliders on our dining room chairs. Our floor is a recently installed laminate. The sliders are well designed but they do not slide. I would say they are ""anti slide"" rather than sliders. A much better product are the 1"" Inch ""Magic Sliders"" found in Amazon's ""Tools & Hardware"" section which I have now installed on our chairs. They are the real deal."
1,NOT for hardwood floors!,"Bought these because I got tired of the sticky felt pads coming off my chairs constantly. Since the floors were new when I moved in, doing my best to protect them so I get my deposit back when I move out. Good thing I only tried it on one chair. Within an hour of sitting in the chair, I looked down and noticed huge gauges in the floor. The stupid little cap that goes on after you screw in the nail came off and created giant scratches--exactly what I was trying to avoid in the first place. I had to wait at least three days before writing a review to avoid an entire paragraph in all caps and exclamation marks. Still pissed, to say the least."
4,"SlipStick 1"" Chair Leg Glide Pads","Worked for me, at least so far. I have tried felt pads and several different types of nylon glides, including the hollow ring type, the dome type and the flat type. All get chewed up during use and all collect grit and hair. Not sure if these will be better, but they seem as good as the others and I wanted to try something different. These pads are unique because a small flat end cap snaps into place and that cap is the actual bearing surface. When these glides wear out, it will be these flat caps that wear out. These end caps are not replaceable.I fastened the SlipStick glide pads on with their adhesive foam disks, but then also with the supplied wood screws. This takes drilling a small pilot hole, as commercial chair legs are usually hard. You probably will not succeed in screwing the wood screws in without drilling a pilot hole."
3,good while they lasted,"well, we were putting them on chairs with metal bases, so screwing them on wasn't an option. We've had them about 2 months - after about a month, they started falling off; and the chairs weren't even used all that much. twice a day at meals. That kinda sucks. Come to think of it, I guess we can try some crazy glue, but i wouldn't think I'd need to - they should have stayed on... Otherwise they worked as advertised while on the chair."
4,"Coming from a recent Daddy, I'm not sure if my word is golden","But a diaper is a diaper. I try to minimize the frequency of changing my daughter's diaper because my wife love's to do it. So in all fairness I want to keep her as happy as the baby. No matter which brand we use, something other than the diaper gets soiled. Obviously this depends on what was for dinner the night before. The supreme seems to fit better than the regular, but this depends on the body shape of the baby, I presume. So, get the brand on sale, the brand you have a coupon for, or in my case, the one that has a rebate."
1,Horribly Leaky,Old Stock which Huggies is disposing thru the Amazon Sale - ends doesnt stick and horribly leaky. Waste of Money. Dont ever buy this. Should have read earlier reviews before ordering this one!
2,Supreme Disappointment,"Tried these on a whim instead of our usual Pampers. The absorbent gel did its thing, but it swelled to an enormous size (!). Even worse, it then proceeded to break up into clumps (granted, she's a kicker/wriggler, but this never happened with the Pampers). Yuck!!! High marks for being fragrance-free and super soft, but alas, I can't deal with shifting continents of swollen gel..."
2,These are a waste of money!!!!!,"There is nothing ""supreme"" about these diapers. First of all, they fit smaller than the ultratrim. Secondly, everytime I have used these diapers on a regular basis, my children have had more leaks than normal. They are bulky and do not absorb well. My husband came home with two bags from the market today and I sent him right back to return them."
4,These are the only disposables I'll use,"I cloth diapered my first son, not only for environmental reasons, but also because of his eczema and allergies. My second son doesn't have any of the allergy problems my first did and I am currently using Huggies Supreme on him until my morning sickess passes and have used them several times in the past while travelling. I had tried several brands of diapers before finding that not only are Huggies Supreme the cutest, but they're also the best disposables at containing leaks. Still not anywhere near as absorbant and leak containing as a good fitted cloth diaper with a good cover, but definitely worlds better than any other disposable. He has a very small waist and chunky thighs, and the shape of these diapers is perfect for him. Pampers and most store brands cut into his upper thighs at the hips way too much."
5,Love it!,I had the hardest time finding a 5 Christmas ornament. I love this one. It has a little sparkle to it which looks so pretty on the tree with the lights shining on it.
3,Small but pretty,The earrings are very pretty but alot smaller then I thought they would be. I wished they were bigger. I also wish that there were rubber tabs for them to help keep them on.
5,celtic earrings are a charm,"The earrings are very high quality and well-engineered - they do _not_ fall out of your ears. They are well-balanced due to the shape of the clip and the high quality silver (heavy yet polished) in both the earring and the clip. Beyond that they are beautiful! I love to wear them. Oh, did I mention that they arrived quickly, well ahead of the estimated arrival date?"
5,beautiful,I bought it as a gift recipient really loved it and I thought it was really nice quality for the price
5,Perfect!,"These earrings are wonderful. Smooth and shiny, with a good weight to them - not too heavy, but not flimsy, or ""cheap"" feeling, at all. I wouldn't change a thing about them =]"
1,Forget Glenn Shorrock?,"Excuse me, but this album doesn't come close to ""holding a candle"" to ANY releases by the original band. The songs are dull and not very well-written. Face it, this is not the Little River Band. And as far as forgetting Glenn Shorrock -- don't make me laugh !!"
2,windows ME watch out,"This is a great math game for children with windows 98 (5 stars). My kids spent lots of time with the game every day for months until we ""upgraded"" with a new computer system. Be wary if you have ME and forget it with windows 2000. Who knows about XP. With ME, the keyboard arrows don't work correctly and youngsters can't advance in the math portion from atleast the 3rd level. Technical support indicated that there will be no fix for any problems experienced for systems with Windows ME, 2000, XP. A suggestion was made to purchase a gamepad controller to see if that helped. The children are quite disappointed and want to go back to windows 98."
3,GREAT GAME,I think this game is great for kids 7-13 its a very fun game that builds math skills and helps you learn your addition subtraction and multiplication i recommend this for kids its great
3,Arcade Action,This software is great for kids. It improves there noledge and it is fun!! I even like this game.
1,Made my dog got sick,"I bought a case of this dog food. Every time my dog ate this food, she would vomit. I changed her food and she was fine. I tried the food one more time as I thought it may have been a bad can. She still had the same response. I can't recommend this food."
3,Some Great; Some Grating!,"All in all, this is a decent set BUT some of these just get on my nerves. But there enough truly Great songs to keep it in my CD player :It's best to listen to on a long drive...where you can just ""skip ahead"" past the ""not-so-great"" tunes!!"
4,great bang for the buck,"Folds up for easy portability, and accuracy is a toss-up with the much more expensive Rollatape units. My only issue has been that the counter reset sometimes takes a few presses to get all the digits back to zero. Definitely a good value if you can find it in stock."
1,not what i expected...,"Wow, I read this book and its' not what I expected. Yes I knew what it was about. But it's the explicit detail that the author gives everytime he is with one of his daughters. I personally DO NOT think he needs to be THAT specific to tell the story, and tell it well. It doesn't matter wheather incest is common, or misunderstood, whatever. I still think it's way to detailed. But, if you like that kinda thing, and like reading about incest, then buy the book. But I think anyone reading it is going to be shocked at first by the detail."
5,Very Pleased,I purchased Milwaukee Sawzall blade to be used especially for cutting through the cedar tree that sits in front of my house and the blade did an outstanding job in cutting it. I would recommend it to anyone in need for the best blade. I am very pleased.
5,Awesome,I bought these to take out the Russian Olives that got a foothold on our back property when we went three years without mowing it. These blades loaded into my cordless 28volt Milwaukee Sawzall result in the best pruning tool I've ever used. The I've taken out dozens of Olive trees with trunks as thick as four inches and I'm still on the first blade. These are a great buy.
4,"Great designs, but check before you begin","I like Mrs. Schurch's designs, and I've been very happy with the hats (5 now-both solid and multi-colored) that I've knitted from it, but I would caution readers to check the charts/instructions before beginning. I have found several instances where following the instructions with blind faith would lead to unhappy results - marked pattern repeats off by one or two stitches, etc. As part of that warning, check how the decreases will affect the pattern - I've found that on some of the patterns I have to move the decreases one stitch to the left of where charted. Finally, don't be overly influenced by the colors used in the photographs - The three-peaked Turkish hat pattern looks really nice in red and white, while the colors in the photo are truly underwhelming.Despite my grumbles, I really do like this book, and have recommended it to friends. I also need to go back and thank the lady who recommended it to me..."
5,wonderful book!,"I love to knit hats and usually take my own ideas and hope for the best, most of the time it works :) But this book is truly a helper to figure out new stuff and get new inspirations. The instructions are easy to follow and its great to have different sizes for each hat, this way it doesn't matter if you take a different size yarn.This one will be in my library for a long time :)Maus"
5,Checked it out from the library.,"When I first got this book in hand I thought whatever because the cover and photos were outdated. Then I started going through the patters. They are classic and easy to do. I have the Komi cap on a set of needles right now, and am loving it. I photocopied the pattern from the library book, and now just ordered the entire thing. I have lots of yarn in my stash and family in Minnesota."
4,Good--but not thrilled,"These types of books are difficult to buy online...as it would be so nice to leaf through them in a bookstore. The patterns for the beginner is quite limited and quickly progress to advanced skills...and I feel I'll be a long time getting there. They are appealing patterns and nothing bizarre, so eventually I may be returning to using this book, but for now, I have put it on the bookshelf. I do think the designs are attractive and well chosen, but think most of them are more suited to intermediate plus knitters?"
4,Good patterns,"I have made 2 hats from patterns in this book now, and I am very pleased with them. The patterns are very attractive and the directions are well done."
5,Furay has come through again.,"Great disc overall. First couple of songs are ok, but then the music is great. Much better than last solo attempt. Musically great, spiritually on target."
5,THOUGHT PROVOKING AND IMAGINATIVE!,"Interspersed with humor (the chapter titles are particularly witty) and insight, the author truly has his finger on the pulse of humanity's ongoing struggle with the very meaning of life. Creating a unique delivery, Steven J. Byers has assembled a superb cast, each of which could be personally identified with at some level, regardless of the characters' age or gender. In his portrayal of this quest for the ultimate answer, Byers has obviously 'put his pen where his faith is' in creating this memorable work; sending the reader a message which is clear, and with a point well taken.""The Life of Your Time"" is a must-read for all who are about to embark on their own journey, as well as for those that have already undertaken this endeavor."
5,When You Go Away,"I am a huge fan of Ms Inclan and have read most of her work. She does not fail me here with When You Go Away. It is a touching and revealing look into a woman's temporary break down. As the pressure mounts choices are presented, when you cave to the pressure and have to escape, there are consequences to be paid. Ms. Inclan creates a world where the reader completely understands and empathized with the wrong choices this woman makes and the irreversible situation that is created because of her actions. I highly recommend this book for everyone who has ever felt overwhelmed.Justice Rules - 2010 Finalist Pacific Northwest Writers Association Literary Contest (A Brian Wylie Novel)"
5,Kept me reading from cover to cover...,"I had posted a review on this book but for some reason it never got listed...Anyway, I just want to say I absolutely love this author. She writes exactly the type of books I want to read. I love all that I have read so far by her and look foward to reading more.This was a very touching story and I won't give anything away. All I can say is that this is a definte must read. Enjoy!"
2,When You Go Away,"Devastated by the collapse of her marriage and the ordeals incurred by having a handicapped daughter, Peri takes off, abandoning not only that child, but her two teen aged children. When the youngest becomes ill, the older children are forced to turn to their maternal grandfather for help. Eventually, Peri is found. Forced to get herself together before she can be trusted to be a mother again, Peri and her entire family must confront generations of demons to reknit their brokenness.** Tragic as the entire situation is, there is an emotional distance and lack of sympathetic characterization that results in a wholy depressing, despondant read. If you just need to read something to prove that there are people worse off than you in your bleaker moments, this might be reassuring. **"
1,Not for solo beginner - appears to be classroom type text.,"Its appears this book is meant for a classroom setting as the book itself indicates there is a ""teacher-text"" and video involved. Overwhelming and confusing right from the start. Definiately not for someone unfamiliar with signing or someone trying to learn on their own."
2,disappointed,I needed this book for school. I looked up the tittle and author and this green book is what came up unfortunately I could not figure out if the book came with the necessary Dvd that I need for the class. From the reviews that I read that said it had video I assumed that the book did indeed come with the Dvd. I bought one that said it had never been opened and yet there was no DVD. Lame.
1,Too complex,"I bought this book for a basic ASL course at my college. I'm already fluent, so I wasn't too concerned about it. This book is terrible. It's confusing and I would not recommend it. Had I not already known sign language, I would not be fluent at all after reading this book.I originally learned onA Basic Course in American Sign Language. It's way better. Also, the site ""Lifeprint.com"" is extremely useful.I do not recommend this book. It is overwhelming."
5,Long-remembered book,"I read this book many years ago, loaned it to a friend, and would now like to buy another copy because I still remember it after more than 20 years. Each chapter is about a religious leader and his wife, showing the influence the women had on the men in their lives. Vona Van Cleef, bookwoman"
4,Portraits by Danny Gatton 1993,"Danny Gatton, one of the most unknown, but well played guitarist in the past 30 years. From blues, country and jazz riffs. He brings them all together in wonderfully melodic way with guitars and horns. His Portraits CD, 1993, demonstrates a mature integration of country riffs and blues. Pretty Blue, written by Gatton demonstrates some slow common blues runs combined with country riffs. Great stuff to practice or listen to - johnj blues2.net"
1,Cannot support an iPad ...,"I bought this and an iPad mount with the compatible screw-on attachment to hold an iPad for my dad, who's a bedridden stroke victim. The gooseneck can't support the weight of the iPad and holder.I'm sure it'd work great for lighter stuff, like a mic. It'd be better for any purpose if it were stiffer, though.It was, as is, for my purpose, useless. If you're looking for a gooseneck to hold an iPad look elsewhere ... a shorter one, maybe?"
2,Will not hold up mic.,"Nice looking gooseneck, threads are clean, fits well. However, the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic (Shure SM58) without collapsing. Better try another brand, or spend a buck or two more to get a better product."
4,Great!,"Great product, very durable! I am very happy with this. it was just what i needed. I highly recommend to anyone."
3,its okay,hard to bend .. i wish i bought a shorter in length its a bit heavy but its fine.... thats all
5,Great ideas,"Even though I'm in the wedding industry, there are a lot of things about getting married that I didn't know. I have found this magazine great for ideas from the big stuff down to the very smallest detail."
2,Way Overpriced Ideas,"I get it, some people like luxury a lot, and I don't mind paying for quality, but when you start recommending 200.00 per person gifts for each wedding guest you've gone overboard. Unfortunately most of this magazine is ads for overpriced coture dresses that are just plain ugly, and that is my review from more than 6 issues in."
1,havent even seen it yet,No real review i still havent aeen this magazine even tho its been almost 3 months. So far ita a waste of money.
4,Good resource,Good value. Magazine has some good ideas for new brides. Alot of dress advertisements but some of the articles are good.
2,"Great once, but lots of repeated stuff","Like most magazines, over 95% of this is ads and the ads are for dresses (75% of the magazine) and honeymoons (20%), which is great but once you have chosen your dress and honeymoon there isn't much left to look at! Each magazine gives you the exact same checklist and timeline for the wedding so you really only need to see it once. My favorite part of the magazine was the last page where you were given a little list of such things as best new dance songs, wedding traditions in different cultures or new DIY ideas. And every magazine would have a couple of pages (literally) that you could apply to your wedding. If you are in the market for a dress, get a book that just has dresses in it (the knot magazine usually has one 2-3 times a year I believe). This magazine honestly isn't worth a subscription and buying it once at the store is about all you need!"
4,I love this magazine!,"Since I got the magazine, I help with many ideas. And its just my first copy too =)"
2,Good if you only want to look at advertisements,"This is a good picture book. If you are only interested in looking at advertisements, this book is for you. If you want to read any articles, look elsewere."
2,Not on time,"I love the magazine I give it 5 stars. However, I have only gotten 1 magazine since I ordered 3 months ago and I'm still waiting for the rest. That's why the rating went down."
5,Changed my outlook on Dance Music,"All I can say is WOW! Yeah, this is the kind of music I have been looking for! All original sound, honest to goodness dance music. This CD has all continually mixed dance tracks that blend together for a uplifting experience with a positive vibe. You can work out to it, you can drive to it, and you can groove to it. I highly recommend this CD, if your looking for a fresh dance CD this is the one to buy, take my word on it!"
5,Great dance music!,"I am mainly a fan of rock music, but a friend introduced me to this album, and I was instantly hooked! There are many catchy songs which stick in your head, and the high energy really makes you want to get up and dance. I highly recommend ""Superstar"", ""Still Loving You"", or ""Closer"", but the whole album is great!"
5,Colors are amazing,The airbrush has no trouble spraying the colors used two sets paint so far thumbs up on it.thank you.so much.
2,Doesn't look like picture,Received product promptly and a week sooner than I thought. The product fit well and was comfortably. However for my liking it was not heavy enough and did not look like the picture. Very little black on ring. So little it blends in and makes the ring look dull and antique.
5,Very helpful ideas!,Great book that I would recommend to anyone wanting ideas to make flowers out of ribbon.
4,great reference,"This title has all the ribbon flower instructions you could ever need, good instructions and pictures. Only wish it had more folding and pleating samples like corcades and pinwheels."
5,Spectacular book,Fast informative and to the point. A travel thru time with comprehensive and flawless instruction. THE RIBBON WORK BIBLE should be its name. Candace Kling does a masterful job of walking you thru the work of beautiful ribbon work. If you get no other book buy this one its 5* plus. I was totally enthralled by this book. I am experienced in ribbon work and it enhanced my knowledge. Having learned the art as an 11 year old it brought back great memories of me and My Grandmother making flowers of a bygone era.
5,"A book to get lost in, inspiring, beautifully done!","Candace brings back the art, beauty, and romance of days gone by through her ""Artful Ribbon"". It's one of those books that you read slowly so that you can soak up every word. . . every image of the most beautiful ribbon flowers and think. .WOW!"
5,Bought another as a gift.......,This was purchased as a gift for a relative who had seen my copy and some of the results obtained from following the directions in the book. The photos are fantastic and the step by steps are clear. One of my prized how-to books!
3,Not much different than...,"...the other brush heads I have used for my Oral-B toothbrush. But hey, it works and my teeth are clean so that's the point, right?"
1,COOULD HAVE BEEN,"A BETTER RATING, ORDERED TWO OF THE SAME THING, GOT TWO SIFFERENT BRUSHES, WHERE I LIVE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE TO RETURN AMAZONS MISTAKES, AND THEY MAKE QUITE A VIT LATELY"
5,"Costly, but works well","I bought this on a lark, and was doubtful that it would really work. But it actually works well - you can see the difference after regular use.I use this with UltraBright toothpaste. It has received high marks in ""consumer"" magaizines for it's stain removal abilities, and is really cheap if you get it at Walmart (less than a dollar per tube). I use it about twice a week, and it makes a visible difference in cutting down and reversing my bad habits of lots of tea, coffee and cigarettes (far fewer of the latter than I used to, but still partake to a certain extent).I've tried using UltraBright with other Oral-B brush heads and while it still works to remove stains, the Pro White works better and quicker.Worth the cost charged."
4,Like It,"Works well & leaves my mouth feeling cleaner. Since I have a tendency to brush too hard, the fact that the Oral-B warns me when I'm doing that is good for me."
5,BEST brush heads i have ever used,"not too hard, not too soft! noticeable diff after one use! love Oral B products! thanks for making a great product!"
3,not sure if it does anything,I use this sometimes in addition to the floss action brush heads but I can't tell if they do anything. My teeth are white to begin with so it's hard to tell if this works.
3,I don't really use much,I am not sure if it works or not. I use the Floss Action head as my main tooth bush and I don't really need the polisher head.I used it a couple times since I got it and it is ok but because the floss action one does such a good job I just don't need this.
1,Thrown in the trash,"This product is no good if I can give it 0stars I would. The bristles dont work good, they are flimsy and the middle part had no bristles at all. We threw it away after 1 week of use."
3,Sent wrong item,"Very fast shipping, unfortunately sent the Floss Action instead of the Pro-White! Since I can use them, I elected to keep them. Shame really."
4,Nik's Oral B replacement Brush Head,Good product but I find that I need to replace the head every month whereas the recommended period (from the Manufacturer) is every 3 months
1,Does not function as designed.,The yellow silicon cup in the center is designed to hold toothpaste just like dentists use a similar tool to hold a granular paste to polish your teeth. Nice idea but regular toothpaste just desolves as soon as you begin to brush. I recommend the Dual Action or the Floss Action versions instead.
4,Super brush head,Loved this brush head for cleaning coffee stains off teeth. I could tell a difference between these and the standard brush head. They don't seem to last as long as the standard brush heads though.
5,Give your teeth pleasure,These brush's are incredible. Teeth have never felt better or cleaner except at dentist office. Very impressed.
2,Not worth it,"I got these hoping that they would work better than the regular brush heads I got with my Oral-B electric tooth brush. I was thoroughly disappointed. Not only did I not feel they provided any extra whitening compared to the time I had spent using the regular brush head, but the plastic circle in the middle would break really quickly and given that there are fewer bristles on the head, my teeth were harder to clean.I have since gone back to using the regular heads and am once again much happier with the color of my teeth, and they even got rid of some stains from smoking that the Pro White brush heads couldn't handle.Stick with the regular heads..."
2,Polishing brush head,"Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)I bought this brush head for the polishing cup feature. While I haven't used it enough yet, I'm not quite convinced the polishing cup really makes a difference. I had hoped that using it with a polishing paste would have the same effect as the dental hygienist's polishing cup, but it doesn't seem to. The paste just scatters on the tooth rather than being concentrated where I have placed the cup. Maybe I'll get better at it, but currently it's just another brush head in my dental regime arsenal!"
4,Oral B Replacement Heads,I ordered these replacement heads and found them to be totally satisfactory.I will order again from Amazon.Clayton Bartlett
5,oral b pro white replacement brush heads,i love this toothbrush. The replacement heads are hard to find in the store. So excited when i found them online for a great price.
5,Great Cleaning!,"These replacement brush heads for the Oral-B Triumph and others do a great job cleaning your teeth and giving your teeth that smooth, just-been-to-the-dentist feeling. The yellow cap in the middle really seems to get your teeth feeling smoother than with just regular brush heads. Definitely worth the money and cheaper than I could find anywhere else. I had been getting these from Razors Direct as they are very fast and have free shipping. However, Amazon's price beat theirs, and the shipping was free - a great bargain!"
5,Great CD!,"Pete Masitti's 2nd album, Turn Around is great! It has a touch of Third Eye Blind or Matchbox 20 in it, and is great listening for many settings. I listen to it at work, at home, in the car. It's a good mix of ballads on upbeat, singable tunes. Turn Around is one of the few CD's that I own that I like every track on it. If you like this CD, also check out his first CD, Green Trim. (The track Green Trim appears on both albums.) ..."
3,Walk Series,"A great series for personal or family devotions, simple with neat tidbits of rabbinical information scattered throughout but not for one who wishes to study in depth. It's a walk in the park as apposed a hike in the wilderness."
2,Shanghai Kiss,"'Shanghai Kiss' stated off by seeming to be a pretty promising film and after about an hour quickly descended into a big disappointment. It really seemed like it was gonna be a good film about following your heart and destiny and finding your path in life and instead became the typical soppy, cotton wool, American fare churned out en masse by Hollywood. The direction was quite good and the Chinese scenes were especially good. The characters tended to act, well, out of character at times, you'd build up an image of them and way they'd behave and the they'd do the complete opposite. At just over 90 minutes this film is the perfect length, anymore and you'd get bored and frustrated. An OK film for those lazy afternoons and when you don't want to think too hard. Don't get your hopes up in the first hour and you should be fine!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,I LOVE NHL HITZ 20-02!!!!!!!!!:),NHL hitz 20-02 was the first game I ever bought when I got my Nintendo GameCube. I like the part when they go on fire. It looks really real to me. I am the Monteal Canadians in the Championship when I play.
3,not bad but far from great,"ok i want to love this game, I really do. It happens to be the most recent hockey game out on any system to my knowledge.but come on, only three players on the ice? whats up with that?You only have access to SOME of the players not ALL of them?and the way the stats are figured for the players is really bad!some of the best players have horrible stats!Curtis Joseph only has a 14 for goalie numbers and hes consistantly one of the best in the league every year!the teams are all screwed up too. Pick a good team and you'll get stomped by a real sucky team. not cool, or realistic!if you dont know anything about hockey you might love this game.but anybody who knows hockey wont like it very much.Its worth a rental and maybe to buy if you find it cheap.NHL 2k is a million times better, but alas it is out of date and is missing current teams."
5,Puttin on the Hitz,"NHL Hitz is a great game that is just like Blitz for hockey. I think all hockey, blitz and sports lovers will love this game and I think everyone should get this wonderful game."
1,Not worth a dime!,"I have purchased every Star Trek video game there is. This one is by far the worst. First, it is very unstable. I have the most recent patches installed but the damn thing will still not stay running. Second, the documentation is very poor. You are left on your own trying to figure out how to play. Third, tech support from the developers is non-existent.I wish I could return it and get my money back."
2,Worst Star Trek Game Ever,"Let's just start by saying I am a Trekkie at heart. That said, this game makes me embarrassed to admit to loving Star Trek. This game takes place during the Deep Space 9 Star Trek series and, much like the series it is based on, is absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to Star Trek. The plot is weak, the voice acting is paper thin, the gameplay is worse than a second grade play, and the game suffers from what I call ""too much, too soon"" syndrome. What I mean by that last part is it attempts to ""drawn"" you in Star Trek by throwing far too much at you at once. It doesn't even get the conventions of its genre right. I don't really remember much about it in detail, but I do remember this piece of junk left me cold after playing for just the first 2 or 3 levels. I regret playing it and owning it to this day. I would sell it, but I don't want to inflict it on anyone else."
3,"Way too buggy, et. al.","This is a very nice looking game, but it's way too buggy, and after you've beaten the main missions (took me about three days of extremely relaxed gameplay), you might as well throw the thing away. One nice thing is that you are supposed to be able to import a ship created with the included edition of Starship Creator Warp 2, but dang it! the game was so friggin buggy, I never even tried. A skirmish mode, a la SFC, would have been *very* nice here; what would have been nicer would have been more thorough support."
1,This game stinks,"I bought this game because it was Star Trek. Also, it CLAIMED that it would work right on Windows 98. But, NO, when I first played it, it crashed, then when I went to XP, it worked but the cursor was slow as heck. Then, I went looking for the patch I needed, and it wasn't there, however there were what looked like dozens of other patches there. It was obsolete, they said. Well I guess I bought the game too late to get the patch then huh? Other than that, it's a good game (if it would work).If you want to try it, go right ahead."
1,Man Cant Star Trek Get a break?,I got this game yesterday. I must admit I was blown away by the grafics at first. Then I tried to play it for a while. It has a large amount of bugs. The load/save problem is rediculus. Especially when Your on mission four trying to blow up the sensor array. And allready hard mission made much worse when you have to restart the whole thing every time. Plus the interface is booring. I really was Quite upset. I'm returning the game this evening. I just wonder if the'll ever be a good Star Trek video game.
2,Very Disappointed,"....The interface is extremely confusing, the view is always from the outside of the ship, the movements are again 2 dimensional, and to top it off, there are no instructions with it. When you finally figure out how to make your ship do anything there is no room for thinking or tactics, just click ""attack"" and it gors through it's motions while you sit back and wonder if you're going to win or not. All in all, not well thought out, challenging, or fun. Now I have to countdown again for ""Bridge Commander"" to come out."
1,"buggy, buggy, buggy! gives ""Star Trek"" a bad name","I'm sure all of you who think it's fun to play actually got the stupid thing to LOAD on your computer, as I did - but every time I tried to launch a game, the darn thing would shut down on me! I didn't even get to play it. It got trashed real quick. Don't waste your money on this buggy game. Don't you think they'd work all the bugs out BEFORE they put a game on the market???? I guess the name ""Star Trek"" sells itself!"
4,Regarding the glitchy or slow mouse control,"This game is not perfect but it is loads of fun. The graphics are excellent and so is the gameplay. However, I will get to the point regarding the glitchy mouse control. Don't bother getting patches 1.05 or whatever some people here have been suggesting. My computer runs on Windows XP and I had the same problems when I first ran the program. The solution:1. go to the Dominion Wars shortcut.2. right click on the icon.3. select properties.4. select the ""compatibility"" tab.5. in the ""compatibility mode"" box make sure the box is checked and choose Windows 98/ME.6. hit OK.7. ""Punch it Chewie!""...oh wait, that's Star Wars.That worked perfectly for me. Unfortunately I had to randomly try things since there is no longer support for DS9: DW. Oh well, such is life. Good luck and happy hunting."
4,Comparing 3 star trek games,I have already provided an earlier review of this game. Here is an addendum comparing Starfleet Command (SFC) vs Armada vs Dominion Wars (DW)- all of which I have played.SFCPros-larger variety in missions.-you get to follow a starfleet career-detailed control of ship systemsCons-too few ships per battle-careers too shortArmadapros-good story animation sequences.-fun to be able to play all sides as integrated part of the storyline.cons-terrible battle sequences- basically army troops posing as star trek ships so the ships fly in strange formations. The game is really Command and Conquer with star ship sprites.-far too many campaigns and starts to get repetitive.-2D spritesDWpros-excellent big fleet battle sequences.-beautiful graphics.-high level control of ship systems.cons-Weak story animation sequences.-Game gets repetitive.-Problems running on some graphics cards.
3,I wouldn't know,"I just bought this game today after reading wonderful reviews about on this web site! It looked really cool on the box. I was, of course warned about the bugs, but I decided to take that risk. I installed it perfectly, but when I tried to play it it crashed. The person on the phone said I had to have some graphics card made in the past 6 or 7 months, which I didn't. So I tried to download the driver that I need, which took 30 minutes and it still wont work and there is nothing wrong with th cd, I am sure, no scratches or anything. My computer should be able to easily run it. I can already tell that this game is loaded with bugs.And I am not just trying to be a gripe, I am a big Star Trek fan and am usually tollerant with this sort of stuff, but this just frustrates me to death.I gave it three stars because I know it is fun(if you can play it). So make sure you have directX 8.0 and a new computer!"
2,Uncooked Pork,"This game has serious problems with the control inteface, sound, graphics and stablity. I like the gameplay when I can get it to run but that won't be more than 10 minutes. And then you can't be sure that your saved game will work.I would wait until these serious issues are fixed before you buy the game"
2,News Flash: Dollars Down Dominion Wormhole,"For those who expected to see a game with the same quality as ""Star Trek: Armada,"" expect a disappointment. For those who were disappointed with the former, need I say more? The introductory cinematic sequences were particularly poor. Unlike Armada, Dominion War's sequences were static, as scintillating as a slide show. Like Armada, it has its share of ""CD stammer"" and associated bugs. The instructions are cursory. This game boasts of the capability of integrating ships customized from the same manufacturer's ""Starship Creator: Warp II"" product, but this capability only works in multiplayer mode.For some reason, the tutorial display is dim, like an underdeveloped photo.The very first mission takes place in ""The Badlands,"" where the control interface is badly garbled. Other than that, the game was fine."
1,This game was horrible,I got this game as when it came out and was very dissapointed. The graphics are fine but the gameplay is awful you can't controlyour ship and you can't figure out what to do.
4,let the war begin,"most of you trekkies watched ds9 series and you know very well about the wars out of gamma quadrant. now you can relive them and change them, help defeat the evil dominion, or destroy all defenses and invade as dominion,YOU control it!"
2,"interesting book, but a lie","I read the book cover to cover and thought it was rather interesting. Unfortanatly the author(s) factual evidence runs thin, and his style borders desparate."
1,Please read a book before submitting a review,"In grade school I used to try and get away with doing a book report on a book I hadn't actually read and I always got caught out. Now I see why. It is very obvious from the reviews who has read this book and who has not. I have not, and so I can not offer any recommendation or criticsm on the book itself (I had to give a star to make a submission). But I would like to point out that all the people who appear to support the book's position seem to actually have read it and offer details of what they liked or disliked. All but one of those who seem not to support the book's position bash the book or its author without apparently ever having read a single page!"
3,Drives home an important point well,"Simply put, in Part III of the book, the authors aptly communicated the important message that evolution is not a scientific theory, but a metaphysical speculation. To summarize it, the the scientific method, rightly applied, produces data which destroys the foundational tenants of evolutionary thought. This point needs to be shouted from the housetops again and again. I'm glad the authors do just that."
1,A waste of money.,Save your money for a real book. You are just making Ankerberg rich by buying this.
1,A poorly reasoned diatribe.,"I came looking for evidence to support Creationism and left empty handed. The authors continuously miss quote or take quotes out of context. Most of their sources are secondary and while there are notes referencing the sources there is no bibliography or index. The book is void of evidence, even in the sections titled ""Creation Evidence"". It is apparent that the authors either did not read Darwin or misunderstood what they did read. They cosistantly mischaracterize his studies and writings, and they assign him intentions and thoughts which he explicitlly denies in his writings. All in all, the book is a disappointment. I would suggest you save your money."
3,Basic stuff,It works although some people complain they cannot hear me. I still don't understand why some phones don't come with a standard headphone jack so we are forced to buy this type of over complicated and expensive headset.
1,Be Careful,What's not mentioned in the advertisement is that this is NOT your typical plug-in headset. It is a specific replacement headset for Plantronic equipment. It will NOT plug into your mini-jack on most average priced telephones. Please do not make the mistake I did and order this headset for your standard phone.
1,Not very quality,Dont care for this product cant adjust it good and it very dark in picture would not recommend it
3,"i'd like to review, but... .... won't let me listen to it!","i do so love sophia's ""bing bang bong"",which i own on the excellent compilation""screen sirens sing"" available fromm rhino records on pink swirly vinyl no less!her cute naive broken english,and smoky sultry voice,make this a great song to take down the christmas tree with!! keeps you humming!with a bing bang bong:)prhaps in the future, ... could put a little more effort into making at least a few songs available for preview."
1,Haywire!,"I am sitting here in a very frustrated state of mind. I have McAfee which has allowed a virus, Downloader AWX, to break into a file and I can locate no technical support. Their 1-800 is closed all weekend and today is Saturday. When their office is open it is virtually impossible to speak to a person.This is the second time I have sought support and could locate none. Their website is completely non-user-friendly. It is totally hostile! They have many boxes of choices, selections and questions--you feel you have to tackle 50 quarterbacks to get past go.I do not want to have anything to do with this backward peration again.This may be last thing I write for a long time as this computeris going haywire."
1,An Underperformer,"I have been trying to utilizse Internet Security 8 since October. I bought a 3 unit license which performs fine on one computer, but only catches half of the spam. On the second one, however,I downloaded it and the software declared it was installed. Never worked. The computer keeps popping up a McAfee error ""an unexpected error has occured in MpfTrayerrors.txt"" no matter what program it is in. If I try to uninstall it gives me another error "" The installation cannot continue because some components are missing."" I am stuck in limbo and cannot even get rid of the useless software. Their support is just as bad. I had to explain over and over again what the problem was to a new support agent on every call. All they could do, if you were even able to understand them, was read a scripted solution. Somehow I will eventually get it off my machine."
2,No real change/ improvement for me,"For me, taking this product was really a non event -- I did not notice any improvement, but maybe that was just me. Hence, I will probably not purchase again."
2,A Christmas book with pumpkins,"What I found really weird about this book was (besides having nothing really new or interesting in it) was that it was essentially a Christmas craft and gift book with a Halloween theme overlay.What I've always enjoyed about Halloween is that it is a time to do fun and goofy things that you don't normally do during the rest of the year - dress up like a rock star, dangle fake bodies in your yard, make food that looks like trash.I feel like this book misses the spirit of Halloween while relying on the basic expectations of the Christmas holiday to do alot of hand-made gifts, and annoyingly complicated recipes.If you are an accomplished craft maker or seamstress, you might get some ideas from this book, but for the average person hosting a Halloween party or dressing your kids lookng for new ideas, I'd look elsewhere."
1,Should be called Ultimate Country Kitsch & Patterns,"The majority of this book is simply country kitsch, costume patterns, and patterns for a crocheted pumpkin vests complete with applicaques... scary and not in the good way. The photography also seems very dated, like it may have been compiled in the 80s. Maybe some would find this book ""ever-so-charming"" or even ""oh-my-stars-delightful"", but its not for the modern Halloween enthusiast. I'm a huge fan of the Martha Stewart Halloween book and I keep looking for other good books on Halloween."
4,Need An Idea Jumpstart? This book is for you!,"I purchased this book because it had wonderful folk art ideas for working in dough. I made two of the projects from the book, using polymer clay and dough. The directions translated easily from one medium to another and turned out spectacular. Also is a great resource for using findings and jumpstarting your imagination on your tools. I did not spend any money on tools and had a wonderful time looking around my home and yard for interesting things I could press into the clay, and then the dough. If you are interested in this craft, this is a great book for you!"
1,Dated looking projects without instructions,"The best part of this book is the elaborate instructions in the first half for making dough, etc. The large majority of the projects however look extremely dated - as if a book from the 70's was re-released today. A few I would consider timeless - but to add insult to injury there are almost no detailed instructions for most of the projects. The instructions that are there are incomplete. For example, I liked the breads and pretzel. A couple of lines of very general instructions for each was included but the one thing I really needed to know - what was used for the salt and other toppings - was not reavealed. We were left to guess from the picture."
2,NOT MUCH HELP FOR CARVERS,"THIS BOOK IS PRIMARILY A ""BIRD WATCHER'S"" BOOK. IT COVERS A LOT OF SPECIES WITH PROFILE VIEWS OF DUCKS AND GEESE, INDICATING REGIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE FOUND. NOT MUCH HELP TO THE CARVER AS IT PROVIDES ONLY ONE OR TWO PICTURES. GOOD PHOTOGRAPHY AND BASIC INFO."
1,Ginger Candy wow from amazon,"I was first introduced to this product in New Orleans. When I cam home to Los Angeles, I couldn't find it in the stores and was so happy to find it. The product was reasonable, came quickly and it totally yummy. It also does the trick for me with heartburn and alleviates a scratchy throat."
5,Yaffe is a Potent Mix of Stanley Crouch and David Hajdu,"By which I don't mean to suggest that he should assault Dale Peck.He shouldn't.But Yaffe has the finest attributes of both men: from Crouch, a breadth of knowledge of the subjects, and a general linguistic fearlessness. From Hajdu, the rare ability to make every sentence count -- no fat here! -- and a willingness to take the reader to intellectual areas he or she had not imagined.If ""Fascinating Rhythm"" isn't on at least two or three syllabi by the year's end, I should be quite surprised.And disappointed."
4,A designer turned scripter writes...,"When I bought this book about a month ago I wasn't so into actionscripting. Now that i've read all the juicy bits, i realize all the cool things i've been missing - i feel like i've wasted so much time! The chapter by Eric Dolecki on system architecture is stuff that i couldn't have imagined even needing to know just a few months ago. This book has taught me a lot! On a slightly negative side, if there has to be one, i'm not sure what level it's aimed at. It was good for me because i had the basics of AS down, but if you don't know any scripting i'd keep away for now and start with something more basic."
3,Too Expensive,"$64 for techniques the online developer community offers for free. All these scripts/tutorials and more are available to download if one visits enough flash sites.Yes the authors do know their stuff, then again you should if your getting published."
5,Peter Pan - Stage Show,My little boy has learned to love theater through this DVD. He knows all the songs now and all the dance moves.
4,Peter Pan,"Peter Pan is a very good movie!My favorite character is Mr.Smee,and the twins.I think that all viewers will like and agree that `Peter Pan,Cathy Rigby` is the best peter pan movie around.This version of peter pan is much better then the Mary Martin version.Drake English(Michael)does a terrific job playing Michael!He is a very good actor for only six years old.The acting is very well done and there are a wide variety of people some older,others younger.If you are looking for a movie to buy for your son or daughter this movie will DEFINETLY appeal to them!I HIGHLY recommend this movie to all viewers and to people of all ages that I think you will enjoy more than ANY other movie in the world!"
2,"More flash, less magic...","More flash, less magic.The Broadway version of Peter Pan is indeed flashy - better flying and other special effects, gorgeous complicated sets, lavish costumes (the mermaid in the lagoon, the Indians are wearing something that doesn't resemble a dollar-store Halloween costume) but I didn't feel any magic from this performance.It's all too Broadway for me. I considered that it might just be that I was first exposed to the Mary Martin version of the musical, but a few friends (who don't particular care either way) said that it felt like it tried to be too ""big"" and misses the Neverland magic.The cast is fairly decent. Hook is fun enough, most of the cast fits their roles quite well, and although I'm not a huge fan of Cathy Rigby's voice, she makes an athletic Peter.Maybe the live performance has more magic than a video can capture, but personally, I'd rather see a reissue of the Mary Martin version."
4,peter pan,"If you haven't done so, and I'm sure alot of people haven't seen the live version of Peter Pan. But watch the live version, the actors are so much more in character than the animated series. The actors put in alot of dedicated hard work to perform for you!"
4,A Peter Pan for the New Millenium,"This new Peter Pan is excellent family entertainment. The acting is much more subtle than the Mary Martin version and Cathy Rigby is surprisingly effective in the role. Her gymnastics background is particularly evident in the truly spectacular flying scenes. The three Darling children are all excellent actors and singers -- Wendy in particular. Cathy Rigby is a very good singer and a competent actress, but I missed the enthusiam and strong voice that Mary Martin brought to the role. The overall production is lusher than the 1950's version -- sets, costumes and lighting are all much improved. If there is a weak link in Peter Pan, it is in the role of Tiger Lily. Her voice is too soft, although she is a good dancer. It does seem, however, that casting the role with a real Native American would have worked better. In closing, this production is a definite improvement over the Mary Martin version and I highly recommend it."
5,This is the best version so far!,"My kids and I have loved watching Peter Pan in many forms, but this is perhaps one of the best musical adaptations of all time. Cathy Rigby does a phenomal job as Peter Pan. You will not be dissappointed in this one!"
2,Why?,"Why is the question I aksed myself throughout this production. WHY did the producers feel the need to take the simple, charming, and exquisitly structured book and revise it, adding humorless schtick and confusing plot devicesw (aka: the mermaids and that whole rock scene)? WHY did the director consistantly choose to go for the cheap laugh instead of keeping with the natural charm and humor of the original version? WHY was the choreography so chaotic and bland? WHY did the producers feel the need to butcher every song they touched with new vocal arrangements, such as the increasingly tedious ""echos"" in ""I'm Flying""? Cathy Rigby proves a worthy successor to Mary Martin, but the rest of the cast, particualrly Cpatain Hook, does not do nearly as well by comparison to the original production, and Rigby simply isn't good enough to carry the production by herself. So the real question to ask you self is, WHY watch this one when the superior original is still readily available?"
5,absloutly a clasic,hi htis is christians cousin me and christian just had found vthis and we love ethis video i will bring this to the june 17 to my aunt dawn and her friend marna we just ca e back from dinner with aunt dawn and her friend marna at bob evens sorry i wrote this soo late we had desert late at night i just found this id iwll wach it in the bath tub and in the bedrooom like i always do with christian however my sister disagrees with us she just got this video she doesent think its a clasic at all she just said it was haroble however she put on a diffrent movie
3,Nearly 4yr old daughter liked most of it.,"Rigby is great. Its a tamer, not so vividly violent version of ""Peter Pan"".It should be stated clearly it's a professionly filmed play version"
3,Disappointed I'd Say,"After seeing this edition of Peter Pan on Broadway, I was quite excited over the fact that it had come out in video form. My excitement diminshed as I began to watch the show. Though I will rate the performance 4 stars, I would rate the editing of the performance for videotape 2 stars. Whoever edited the tape gets a failing grade. Too many times you can clearly see that Ms. Rigby is lip synching the songs. Though this might make for a better tape, there are times when you hear her voice but her mouth has stopped moving. The biggest disappointment was the fact that the video version did not have the sequence showing when the Darling nursery stage set ""breaks apart"", and the stage is transformed into a vision of a star filled night as Peter Pan and the children fly off to NeverLand. Seeing this live on Broadway only builds ones excitement. Not seeing it on the video makes me feel short changed."
4,Do you miss My Bloody Valentine?,"This album isn't groundbreaking, but they've got their shoegazing noise act down pat. Combines the distortion fields of ""Loveless"" with the sloppy playfulness of ""Isn't Anything"". I've heard other Lilys albums and this is their best."
1,Really Bad Quality,Leather is already worn off at places. Box says stock is year old and believe shoes do look like year old. Waste of money.
4,"Very comfortable, light weight",I always wanted to buy sketchers shoe and waiting for a good price. Got one.
3,"NOT A review, just a note for the reviewer above me...","While you claim to have read it in ""old English"" in school, you most likely were reading an updated version as well. The original was in MIDDLE ENGLISH not Old English. And looks a little something like this...Heere bigynneth the knyghtes tale.Whilom, as olde stories tellen us,Ther was a duc that highte Theseus;Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne,What with his wysdom and his chivalrie;Very little like your ""old English"" of the KJV Bible..."
1,Miffed at Most,"I had no idea that this was not the original text, but a translation from old English to new. I read the old English in high school and didn't have a problem with it, perhaps because I was used to the King James bible. I certainly am not going to read this translation and will put it up for sale. I really enjoyed the original text and prefer to read that."
2,The Novelty Wears Off Quickly,"I confess, I'm a cat lover and I thought the premise of hearing cats ""sing"" an album of Christmas music would be a hoot. Unfortunately, the novelty wears off rather quickly. Listening to one song is funny. Listening to the entire album in one sitting is a bit like beating yourself repeatedly over the head with a ball peen hammer...it feels so good when you stop! If they celebrate Christmas in hell, this is the album they play."
4,Funny Stuff!!,"Being a humongous fan of the first Jingle Cats Meowy Christmas, I had to try this one out for size. Gotta say, as a cat lover and dog lover (okay, just a plain out animal lover) these extremely talented cats (and their conductor) make me laugh over and over again. Whenever I'm down, I just pull out my jingle cats and they brighten my mood instantly. My two cats, including a 25 pound tom cat, just love this CD as well. It's a laugh a minute. The four stars are because, well, let's just say a little goes a long way. You CAN overdo it with this CD, as well as the other one. It tends to get old quick."
4,Four Paws Up,"I was sampling this cd before purchasing it. My two alphamale cats came racing into the living room, wanting to knowwhere the ""intruders"" were-mylaziest cat even woke up, ears alert. So if you want to getyour cats' attention-this al-bum is for YOU.I cracked up laughing, this has got to be one of the fun-niest albums I've EVER heard-I give it a ""four paws up.""Creative genius-or madness, I loved it. I also bought it."
5,How adorable !!!,They sing better than most people. I collect Christmas carols. I thought I had everyone til this. A must for my collection.
5,jingle cat news,Everyone thinks that little cats are cute. Hearing them on a cd is even better! For the funny holidays too! Here comes Santa claws even has a good title. Jingle Cats rock!
5,HOT LATIN JAZZ WORTH 10 STARS **********,"I own several Jazz and Latin Jazz albums and this one deserves to be in the top 5 in both categories; Arturo es simply FABULOSO, his style, performance, technique, everything is as great as it gets, he is a hyper-genius and shows it in every song; the highlights are Funky Cha Cha Cha, Rythm of our World (that tributes Latin and Brazilian Jazz concepts blended perfectly), No se tu (with a superb vocals by Patti Austin), Sandunga (perhaps the best cut in the album), and Mam-Bop. Do not let this gem pass you by, You will never regret adding this piece of art in your gallery."
5,His best work ever !!!,"This album is right on target. It's a great blend of jazz and Latin music. We're wearing out this CD!!!!!! If you only have one Arturo Sandoval album, make it this one."
2,"Required for class, but difficult to follow","This book is a compilation of research studies and findings/publications. I had to have it for class, but I found it very difficult to follow at times. It felt as though someone had compiled a bunch of bad homework assignments into a book! You know, like the author was required to write something, and this was the best they could come up with. Some of the information and findings were helpful for the class, but most were not. Unless you HAVE to have this for a class, I wouldn't suggest it."
2,Over-Hyped Book,"I was not impressed by this book that was recommended to me by several mental health professionals, including the social worker at my daughter's school. I wanted to understand anxiety disorders better and I was underwhelmed by what this book had to offer and had a hard time making connections with the material. I would recommend ""Freeing Your Child From Anxiety"" over this book. I felt I walked away from that book with actual tools to put into practice to help deal with her anxiety better. I felt this book talked about the disorder but didn't really give me anything I could take back and use with her."
5,Great workbook,"This book is cool. My 10 yr old daughter, who likes to draw, did the workbook and thought it was fun while she was working out ways to deal with worries. I didn't have to read it to her or ask her to do it. She just picked it up and dove into it."
4,informative & helpful,I found this book informative & helpful. It was recommended by a friend who is a counselor and licensed social worker. The book helps the reader recognize signs of anxiety in children which can often be different than the signs displayed in adults. It also helps an adult determine the severity of a child's anxiety and includes good ways to teach kids to deal with their anxieties.
4,"very happy with Chameleon, but not 100% one-handed","Nice knife. Fits comfortably and securely in hand, with not too much weight, and decent balance. Blade's edge has held up well for over a year. The description doesn't make any claims about one-handed operation, so I cannot fault it too much for that, it's just that it is not the smoothest operation, and so two hands seem better than one. But if one hand it busy doing something else, yeah, I can manage it one-handed. Am curious if others may have units that swing open a little easier than mine when trying to do one-handed? But very practical, with a nice ballistic sheath. Very handy and sturdy at work."
1,lousy prep book,"I bought this book because the other Princeton Review books I have read have been so helpful, unfortunately this one just did not measure up. I do not reccomend this book at all, don't buy it."
3,stuck in limbo...,"I took the sat 2 us history test a month after the ap test. I thought I had enough prep from the ap class to take the sat 2 subject test. A few days before the exam, I casually looked at the book. It is a very quick review, that would not allow to score an 800 with just the book. With prep from ap and a few days of this book, I landed a 700 on the exam, which was a bit disapointing. It is not as bad as others have commented. However, it is perhaps not as great as it could be, thus I give this book a 3."
4,Melancholy Portrait Still Provoking Response,"The stories of the owners and caretakers of the portrait, from its beginning to present, create a colorful tapestry of their own. For someone who is not intimate with the negotiations of the art world, the book is informative and surprising. It may not have been the author's intention, but I also felt a thread of sadness and melancholy, as though the artist and the subject still have an investment in the future of the canvas. Perhaps it is the awareness that all the owners eventually gave it up and that the current owner has removed it from sight. The author of this book has given us the facts, but has also invested those facts with meaning which speaks clearly about the impact of the artistic process, if one is willing to consider beyond the obvious."
2,"Hey, Starry Night would go for 100,000,000$!","She veers off into things that really don't pertain to the needed info about Vincent V. Too much like a history lesson on WW2! How about some info on other masterpieces and there values like, is Starry night worth more than Dr.Gachet? Some art experts put it over that and the value of the Mona Lisa(125,000,000!)Also where is the painting at now and go into why Saito kept it away from the public!?The book in my opinion was done too early!Hey, why don't I write the sequel I could do alot better job in my opinion!"
2,"Sucks, didn't pick up signal","Tried every position conceivable and still got terrible FM reception. Maybe it is just my area, but now I'm stuck with a useless dipole antenna that gets worse reception than my flimsy looped wire."
2,Dipole Downer,doesnt seem to do the job of bringing in the FM signal. no matter how i drape it around the receiver.
2,Poorly made,"It works well, now that I re-made it.One of the wires on the lead-in was broken where it enters the white-plastic molded-T. The plastic T needed to be cut off to repair the wire. In the process of removing the T, I found that it was installed off-center originally, which is probably why the wire was broken.It was simply a matter of poor manufacturing and no quality control.But for $4, I guess I can't complain, as getting the wire precut was worth that much."
2,It does work...sorta,"I've had this atenna a few months now..the pic is decieving..Its realy long,I guess thats supposed to give it more exposure. Its better than nothing but barely.I use it on a Sony reciever and i can barely pick up local stations if I tweak it just right.Not happy with it.Gave it 2 stars because of price only.For the price its to much of a hassle to send back"
5,Music for the soul,"Catto and Bridgeman and so, so clever. An intelligent mastering of world music, One Giant Leap is a bold movement for music, and people. A wonderful selection of artistes from the world over, singing songs ""my grandfather earned... for [our] culture"". A stunning album with lots of heart. Expect ethnic percussions, haunting sirens, modern pop/rock, unique instruments, and a beautiful fusion of the differences that make music and life so perfect. A product with so much character, you'd almost feel you've met, personally, each and every of the artistes and musicians."
4,Compares to every style ever recorded - & nothing ever done.,"A jet-powered trip around the world, rootsy folk traditions blended (or is it jammed?) together with pop, electro-disco, jazz, psychedelic and classical traditions - including spoken word, mellow rap, and idealistic 'save the world' sociological commentary: that's 1GIANT LEAP in a large nutshell.1GIANT LEAP compares to every style ever recorded - and nothing ever done before. Beat Poetry? Beatles? Youssou N'Dour plus George Harrison channels Ravi Shankar?1GIANT LEAP defies easy categorization - and challenges the imagination.All this - and if you want, there's a DVD supporting the music, of the same title."
2,Return to Deep Forest,"A perfect example of bland contemporary ""world fusion"", 1 Giant Leap is the kind of dross first perpetuated by the likes of Deep Forest and Enigma in the early 90s: grab some disparate performers and musical styles and mash them together until they achieve a consistent form. In no respect could this be considered a valid international collaboration, in which each performer works with others in the creation of something unique. The guys behind this bilge have simply thrown in whatever's necessary to sweeten the mix, creating sterile, context-free music that is JUST PERFECT for cocktail parties and dinners! Meaningless and entirely disposable."
5,"If you buy only one DVD this year, make it this one!","Amazing. Vast undertaking, superbly realized. Spiritually moving. Shows the interconnectedness of all people, places, things. If you buy only one DVD this year, make it this one.My only wish is that the music was available on a recording device other than CD, so that i could purchase it for my sister the luddite who eschews modern technology but would LOVE this!"
3,Mixed feelings about this purchase,"The good: bag seems really well made, handle seems very rugged, stores enough water for 2-3 quick showers.The bad: I left this in the sun (low to mid 70s) for four fours and the water was barely any warmer than when it started. Obviously, I didn't expect stellar results, however my elementary education tells me that the reflective lining should be on the inside to the water, not the outside. The bag has one clear side and one reflective side, but it points to the outside, reflective solar energy away from the water. That being said, it worked great when I put it in my trucks engine bay while it idled (laying on a plastic cover). After a half hour I had a nice warm shower. Seems to me that an all black bag or one side black and the other side reflective to the water would have been a better design."
4,Great product,Great product. I would by again. Works perfect for 2 person 1 night camping trip. I took 1 star away because I wish the water came out a little faster. The shower head is a little small.
2,Tiniest 3 gallons you'll ever see,"This is a nice 1-person shower - but, in fact, it only holds 2 gallons, not three. But that's not a bad thing, as a compact shower with a lot of water is hard to hang, so small is beautiful, if you can overlook the gross mislabeling."
2,Buy a magnet instead,"I suppose this product lives up to the premise under which it is sold, that is, it does find metal in wood. But for the price, this product is definitely over-priced. I was expecting something a bit more weighty and powerful, but instead got a lightweight Chinese piece of plastic that is not going to hold up under shop conditions. I also question whether it is going to pick up metal deep in the wood, because under test conditions this equipment had trouble. That is, I had to run it over a nail that I knew about several times in order for it to beep. I just hope that I won't chip a blade on a nail I might have missed by using this. My advice to prospective buyers, buy a magnet instead, it'll work just as well and won't cost near as much."
3,Loud but adorable!,This lamp is sooo cute! My daughter loves it but the music is so loud it blasts the speaker so I rarely let her play it. I really like the 10 second delay for the light.
2,BROKE after only 6 months,"I bought this product for my girls room who are 4 and 8. I loved it at first, the music didn't annoy me nor did the fact that you can only turn it off and on by pressing the button. I turned the lamp off this morning to get my kids ready for school, went to turn it on before bed tonight and the thing doesn't work, I replaced light bulbs tried different plugs in the house, turned it off and on about 50 times to no avail. This really upsets me since we only have had it for 6 months. I would have given a much higher rating but I think it is a rip off for only working that long. AND NO it didn't fall or anything, the lamp is in perfect shape still, I could resell it by picture if it weren't for it not turning on at ALLLLL... I am really upset as you can see. Good luck to all of you who already purchased this just to find out in 6 months it won't work."
4,Daughter loves it,This is a very cute light my daughter loves it but it is very loud and you cant turn down the volume plus it only plays one song. But she likes to hear it play even so
1,Quit Working Within 2 Months,"This is a beautiful lamp and it looks great in my daughters room. It plays music and Tinkerbell dances. These are options that can be turned on and off which is also great when you don't want to wake your sleeping child with the music it plays after switching the lamp off. The music is pretty loud. We can hear it no matter where we're at in the house. The problem is it quit working within 2 months of normal use. When I click the on and off switch the lamp flickers but the light doesn't stay on and the music doesn't play anymore. Also, Tinkerbell no longer dances. It's very disappointing."
1,Cute in theory...,This lamp looked so cute online but in person it looks very cheap and plastic-y and it worked the first time we turned it on then when we tried to use it again it was just dead.
4,Tinkerbell Lamp,"The Tinkerbell lamp is adorable. It is well made and the likeness is very good. The only thing I would change is having a separate switch for the lamp and music. You can turn the animation off, but the lamp works only with the animation switch. It was very confusing at first and we found out how to turn the lamp on by accident. Having some directions would have helped. But it is going to look lovely in my new granddaughters room"
3,"Cute, yes. Practical, no.","Despite being very ""plastic-y"", this is a cute lamp. My 3 and 4 year old daughters love it. It can take decent wattage so it serves its purpose.However, I've noticed a couple of things:This lamp is loud; VERY loud. I have found no volume control but the sound can be turned off.The lamp is oddly temperamental about turning on. The light bulb is good, and properly inserted; yet sometimes I have to flip the power on and off a couple of times."
1,Very disappointed,I purchased this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. I didn't take it out of the box because I was lead to believe that it was a brand new product. WRONG! After Christmas when my she tried to turn it on it never worked. It was a used lamp. I will never purchase another product from this seller again. So buyer beware! And of course the return policy sucks. Should have read it better!
3,Tinkerbell lamp is extremely loud!,I was so excited to buy this lamp for my daughter's room. It is even cuter in person than in the picture. We put in the lightbulb and plugged it in and nothing. we made sure the power switch was on and the sound switch was on but nothing happened. We tried different plugs and nothing happened. Finally we pushed the button on the flower and the light came on and tinkerbell started to move but the music that started playing was so unbelievably loud I thought I would go deaf. Something is definitely not right with the music being that loud. Also the light blinks off so I think there might be a short somewhere. I ended up stuffing cotton balls under a flower where the speaker is to help muffle the sound but it doesn't do much good. (I told my daughter it was snow). haha. I think I am going to send this back and see if I can get another one that works better and is not so loud because my daughter really likes it.
3,"NICE LAMP, WITH A FEW FLAWS","This is cute lamp. My 7 year old daughter likes it, and it goes well with her Tinkerbell themed room. The lamp has a couple of flaws that keep the rating down in my opinion. First, the music and dancing only happen when you turn the lamp on or off. If the lamp is already on, it would have been nice to have a separate button you could press if you wanted to hear the music and see Tinkerbell dance, but didn't want to turn the lamp off. Second, there is no volume control, and the music is REALLY loud. REALLY loud. ANNOYINGLY loud. A nightstand size lamp should have soft pleasant music, or at least a volume control.Overall its just OK in my opinion. I didn't see any other options for Tinkberbell lamps, but if you happen to see one, check it out before you buy this lamp. If you can't find any other options, this lamp looks nice, and its cute, but know the limitations above."
1,Do NOT buy this lamp!,We received this lamp as a gift for my daughter's birthday. It stopped working two weeks after we got it and the makers refuse to replace or refund. What a rip off and disappointment.
1,Disappointed Daughter,"I bought this lamp for my daughter when we were moving her into a bigger room and into a big girl bed while waiting for her bother to arrive. I bought the light in November before we needed it. I wanted it to be a surprise so we didn't open it until a couple of months later. When we did open it, Tinkerbell would turn but nothing else. The light wouldn't even work. I contacted the seller and they suggested I contact the manufacturer. KNG is impossible to get a hold of. I tried several phone numbers and got nowhere. I contacted Amazon and filed a complaint. They could not help me either. I would be happy if the light just worked. Now I'm stuck with am expensive decoration. I guess in short, make sure the product works as soon as you receive it, or you will be stuck like us. KNG is an unreliable manufacturer."
2,Returning . . .,"This lamp is so cute, just like the picture BUT so freakin' loud! I mean, if my 3 year old has to cover her ears to hear it . . . it isn't that great right?Plus, the on & off is weird - like you can't just press a button or turn a knob. You have to switch it in the back - then press the flower and the light & music come on . . . then to turn off the light, you have to use the switch in the back. Seems like a lot of work to turn on a lamp!I love the look - if there was a way to turn the music down, we would have kept it."
3,KNG Disney Fairies: Tinkerbell Animated Lamp,"I don't know exactly what this item is made from, but it is very light weight. I expected a little more in the way of the animation, but I got the lamp at a very good price so I expect I got what I paid for. Be aware that pushing the button for the animation will also make the lamp turn out when the animation completes (or sometimes a few minutes after), just push the button again to get the light to stay lit. The face on Tinker Bell is not quite up to par, but keeping the lamp at a distance alleviates that."
2,Would be great if it worked.,"Purchased this June 27th, received it the 29th. Today is July 9th and the lamp has quit working. No light, no dancing, no music. Fortunately we're able to get a refund on it so I will attempt to purchase it again and see if it works longer than 2 weeks this time.The operation of the lamp is a little weird, but since it was meant for my 2 year old my opinion doesn't matter. Her opinion is that it is awesome. I think the music is a little loud, but the dance is cute and just the right length of time, I think."
4,Pretty Tinkerbell Lamp,"This Tinkerbell lamp was a gift for my 8 year old granddaughter who loves it. Her almost 3 year old sister loves it as well. Their mother had some issues figuring out how it works -- 1st push on the button turns the light on and the music sound, 2nd push on the button rotates the Tinkerbell, 3rd push on the button turns off the light, accompanied by the same music sound."
5,Fun!!!,"What can I say...whenever I need a reminder that anything is possible, I turn to Maira Kalmans books. They remind me that things can be flipped sideways or turned upside down. I wish I could borrow Maira's eyes and mind and heart so that I can see the world the way she does."
5,Fun!,"I just love Maira Kalman. She's wacky and interesting, and her ""stories"" have a fun non-linear structure. My 3-year-old loves to look at the illustrations, in all their silly, non-sensical detail."
1,Eh,"I must say this book and another book we have by this author are my least favorite books of our MANY children's books to read with my boys. I love children's books and hoped this would grow on me, but I avoid reading it. I don't like how it reads, I don't love the illustrations, and there is really no story. Really not a book for us!!"
4,Fun and Exciting,My 10-year old son LOVES this book. He thinks it is very interesting and fun in a very weird way. He loves how kalman shows all the different things people do for work in New York City. He also loves the artwork and how Kalman names people. His favorite is the Pancake man and Zoltan Zizmore.
5,ABSOLUTLY AMAZING IN EVERY WAY!,"(in one word) supercalifradgelisticexpialidochious. Even such details as the names of the characters (Mrs. Clarence Pffafenburger, Ms. Sauerkraut, Ethel Schloogle.)I love thinking about having a job that Maira Kalman described. ""Conduter, light bulb changer, complaint taker, oyster stew artist,"" are reaveling."
1,Inappropriate for any age level,"The artwork is unappealing, and seems as though she is ridiculing people. The tone is too bitter for children, and the book lacks any emotional truth that might appeal to a teenager or an adult. Like most of Kalman's work, this book generally is pointless; like when a college student feels embarrassed after making some vapid comment, and so pretends that it's an ""inside"" joke."
3,A Bit Too Immature For Older Teens,I bought this from the reviews thinking it might be good for my 17 year-old-daughter. It is geared more for a 12 or 13 year-old. Very simplistic.
3,Now what I expected,"I thought this book would be more in-depth, but I found it to be a high-level guide, but I suppose it is good for its target audience, teenagers."
5,"IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR INTUTION ""READ THIS""","It is the most educational spiritual book I have EVER read.""THE GAME OF LIFE"" and how to play it. It basically says that life is just a game, and their IS a way to play it! It has changed my (mind). Life is far more exiciting now, after reading it."
5,Awesome Book,"I first read Florence's book ""The Game of Life"" many years ago and fell in love with her timeless philosophy and outlook on life. Since that time I have purchased numerous copies as gifts for friends & family."
5,the writings of florence scovel shinn,"A LIFE CHANGING BOOK.SIMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL.FLORENCE,S WISDOM IS TIMELESS AND UPLIFTING .SHE COMBINES THE KNOWLEGE OF THE BIBLE WITH GREAT UNIVERSAL TRUTHS.MY LIFE IS ALREADY TRANSFORMING EASILY, JOYFULLY AND EFFORTLESSLY.ALL OUR BLESSED WHO READ HER BOOK"
2,Very disappointing.,"This book was recommended by my counselor. the author takes Biblical truths and warps them into a feel good, positive thinking, kind of philosophy, taking many of the applications totally out of context. The book was an insult to the wisdom of the Bible."
2,The Writings of Florence Scovel Shinn,"I have only read the first four chapters, but it sounds like a prosperity scheme. A ""name it and claim it"" philosophy is a verypopular idea.One to which I do not subscribe. To be fair, I will continue to read further."
5,prosperity consciousness from another source,"Florence Scovel Shinn was writing about prosperity consciousness in the late 1800's and early 1900's, well ahead of the current trend. Her books are easy to read and easy to understand. I highly recommend this book to all of my friends and they are purchasing it and doing the same. That says it all in my mind."
3,American Heroes movies,"I bought Bridges at Toko-Ri to compare Michner's version with how thisraid actually went. The movie was mostly Hollywood-and-romance and the Michner version of the raid was nothing at all like the brilliantly planned and executed actual one. I wouldn't recommend it for Korean War history interests but the Hollywood aerial shots are pretty good,as is the acting."
5,stinkin' great,"Stop reading this and go buy the CD. You need this CD. You're still reading, buy it already."
4,Tight CD,This CD is tight I saw them Live at FYE in Kenwood and they totally rocked out. They have really inspired me and my band to stick with it and play basically whatever we want. Their freaking awesome I would recommend this to anyone who likes Metal and Rock GREAT CD
1,this sucks,"this album is just what i would expect from a band with the word ""theory"" in their name. i have seen them play live and it is actually worse than the album - if that's possible. for some reason people think this band is good, but that's probably because they are from akron where there are no descent bands. anyway, don't buy this album unless you feel like laughing."
2,"Easy to read, but not very enlightening.","If you know absolutely nothing about Spain, this could be a nice book to very lightly acquaint you with the Spainish culture. It definitely does not live up to it's description. It touches on (one paragraph) many different topics, many of which I would have liked to know more about but just read about what I already know. It's not horrible, just basic. It most definetly does not prepare one for a trip to Spain or if you plan to move there(as I am doing). For example, it tells you there are comprehensive bus and train systems...I need to know their names and how to use them.(of course they have them, anyone would assume that) For me this was a waste of time and money."
3,Helpful hints for Brits trying to move to Spain,"This is a book of advice for folks planning to settle in Spain, particularly in the foreign retirement enclaves along the Mediterranean coast. It is heavily oriented toward the British, as the Culture Shock books are a British series. For the rest of us, it has a lot of interesting and potentially useful information that you do not find in tourist guidebooks, written in a pleasant, chatty, though sort of repetitive English nanny style. It is fairly unorganized. But if you're even thinking of moving to Spain, it's good to read whatever good advice you can get your hands on, and this book has plenty of it. Somebody mentioned that Penelope Casas is better: Penelope Casas is a great read, but my impression is that she travels mostly with The Well To Do, which is definitely what I am not one of."
3,Funny!,"I'm not even going to attempt to claim that this is a high-quality album, because it's not. But who cares? The value of this album is not that it's good, but that it is so side-splittingly funny. Where else will you hear samples of cats meowing, put to the tune of Christmas caroles? I never did buy this album, but I do remember when I first heard it -- a friend had it, and brought it over, and we promptly put it in and listened, laughing the whole way through. What made it better was the dog, who was positive she heard cats and began to look everywhere: behind the speakers, under the stereo, out the second-story window.... If nothing else, see if you can borrow a copy from somebody just to hear it. Or inflict it on anyone else. Great fun, and silliness for those fond of silly albums."
2,I bet they're lip-synching!,"Just kidding, of course. The Jingle Cats sing all their own lyrics, although the use of backup singers, Snowball and Fluffy, certainly help deliver a broad range of rich feline tones lacking in the Jingle Cats first holiday-inspired record, Easter Cat is Coming to Town. Here, we see the success of that first album forced record execs to give into the Cat's desire to experiment with Me-ewe and Me-yau sounds, in addition to their basic but improved Me-ow. Unfortunately, the overly dramatic buildup throughout ""I Want a Clean Litter Box for Christmas"" proves to be overkill, lessening the emotional impact potentially felt by its haunting lyrics. Before this prevents you from purchasing this album, this reviewer also thought the Harmony Hounds were musically immature, and we all know how well they've done!"
5,Very Meow,"Yes the cat lovers dream - a gift for mom, she loved it, opened it on christmas day and my sister played it during opening presents time! - All had a good laugh and meowed along......to Christmas songs! Funny stuff and really quite relaxing - my eight year old loved it so much and played it every night at bedtime! This is the cats meow!"
3,Kinda funny,"Its basically a Keyboard wih different cat meows to match the tone of the note. So basically the ""meows"" are kinda obrupet and dont really flow together.So you never really get the sense of a actual cat singing."
1,"awful, just awful","I thought this would be a great purchase for my cat, but my cat became very irritated with these songs.Long story short, if you love your cat, don't waste your money on something that is going to seriously irritate your cat.If you hate cats... this might be a good purchase."
2,"Next stop, North Pole!","This CD, produced and arranged by Mike Spalla, features ""real kittens singing 20 holiday classics"". That is to say, the lyrics of Christmas songs are meowed by cats. It's fake, though. Cats' meows were recorded with a sampler and played back on a keyboard. There are also a few dog barks thrown in here and there. All the songs are old, public domain songs, so Mike Spalla doesn't have to pay royalties to the songwriters. It is somewhat amusing for one or two songs, but it gets pretty tedious after 50 minutes. ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" is the most amusing song here, in my opinion."
4,Hound Dog was recorded by multiple artists - maybe Dean's friend just had a bad memory?,"Maybe his friend remembered the artist wrong. ""Hound Dog"" was originally recorded in 1952 by Big Mamma Thornton (released in 1953 on Peacock Records.) Elvis covered it in 1956.Several country versions exist as well, recorded 1953-1956.My point being, eyewitness testimony or memories are unreliable. Most times due to our human brains being so psychologically prone to confabulation. However, it is all we have in the case of remembering people and events. It is hard to have someone so famous like Dean and not have people ""invent"" who they think he should've been - instead of who he was. I think we never truly know another human being anyways. We are all of us ""touching from a distance"" and only scratching the hazy surface of who we ourselves are. Most can only hope to achieve some measure of immortality in their lifetimes. How wonderful on film, how brightly did Dean shine. He shines for the ages."
4,"Well done, Mr. Dalton","In the slew of Dean Biographies I've read, this came to me third. And I was in general, very privelaged to read it. It is concise, thorough, factual, and eloquent. Favorite parts in all Dean bios are his chilhood years, his 3 years before success, and experiences while making his 3 films- and this book does wonderful justice to those times. You'll learn about his sex, loves, and hot&cold personality. There were a few(only a few) moments where some details lagged and dragged slightly. Those thoughts, however, disapeared instantly with the next sentence I would come upon in the book. It's in my top three Dean bios list-probably #3. Please let yourself discover Jimmy. Buy this and several other of his bios and take them on a vacation(or some time and place where you can commit yourself to them)and devoure them.""James Dean-Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", and ""Live Fast Die Young"", are two other necessaries. This is a must read. Happy Readings!"
5,If you love the HP books you'll love this band,"My family and I have been fan's of HatP for about 2 years. We have all the band's CDs, and see them perform 2 times (going to see 3rd time next week). This is the best CD of the band yet. One min your rocking out to songs like 'New Wizard Anthem' then dancing to upbeat song 'Save Ginny Weasley From Dean Thomas'. This CD also includes not one but two power ballids with 'Dumbledore' and 'Phoenix Song'. Some songs are serious but most are just plan funny. Other great tracks are 'Song for the Death Eaters', 'the Monkey Suit' and 'We Save Ron's Life, Part 8'.A. Oeseburg (FairyMama) wrote this review"
4,so far so good,"plants were healthy, well packaged, on time, above expectations across the board, they are in the ground and still alive...very pleased thus far..."
3,Disappointing,Still waiting to hear the Om sound on the CD -- just a mixture of sounds -- not what I expected.
5,excellent!!!,"I downloaded this album on MP3. I have to say this is an excellent CD, its very relaxing and takes you into altered states of consciousness. It does the job in relaxing you and at the same time raising your vibration and frequencies. I would recommend this for healing practitioners, mediation, and for people interested in raising their vibration."
3,Another identical Denis Adler Mercedes book.,"Mercedes-Benz 110 Years of Excellence gives a very general overview of the history of these cars and the company. The book is well illustrated, but most of the photos we have seen before in other Dennis Adler books. There is little depth to the text and many common models are omitted completely. In fact it is basically the same book as any of Dennis Adler's other Mercedes books. If you've read one, you've read them all."
2,Basic operation of a Bridgeport covered,"This book is well written and covers the basics of operating a Bridgeport style knee mill. However, you will still need a factory manual in order to handle maintenance on the machine so some of the material is redundant. Also, other topics are more thoroughly covered in other books."
3,"Simplistic, but fun.","I'll be blunt. This is an easy game with fairly dull and repetitive graphics. But I knew that before I bought it. The real gem in this game is Daria herself. Her sarcastic humor is in classic form here, and I appreciate the decision to use all the original voice actors to play the characters in the game. Gameplay is pretty simple and a nice way to kill an hour or so with no replay value.If you're a diehard ""Daria"" fan, the fan experience isn't complete without this game. If you're not, don't lose sleep over not having played it."
2,Cute but way too easy,"I can't call this game a total disappointment. I'm a big fan of ""Daria,"" and the game was definitely true to the show. The characters behaved like they do on the show, the voices were all done by the original actors, and the game more or less looked like Lawndale.Unfortunately, it's not much of a game. It's a combination of far too easy, and too much ""hunt the pixel."" It's worth playing for the Daria atmosphere, but certainly not for the game itself."
2,Would be fine if you didn't have to pay for it,"I love Daria alot, which is why I got this, but it really wasn't worth it. It was really easy and short- I finished the entire thing in about an hour. While it had interesting parts that are nice, I feel it was a waste of money..."
3,"Please,","The game itself is fun, but it needs to be harder, much harder. I am 10 and it is simple for me even!"
3,"Cute shoes, sizing is off","I normally wear a size 6. So that is what I ordered in these shoes. They were *huge* on my feet! It was like I had ordered a size 8! The design is awesome, and quite possibly they could have been comfortable had they not have been way to big.I ended up returning these shoes, and not re ordering as I didn't feel like going through the hassle of sending them back and re ordering until I found the pair that fit right."
5,Great Deal!,Awesome Gift! I got these for my sister and she loved them! I need to get a pair for myself now. Super comfy. Love them!
2,Cute but too Big,"Unfortunately I had to return this adorable shoe. I have another similar pair in this brand and the size I got fits fine, but this shoe in the same size was much too big, and sadly, it was the smallest size they offered."
5,pirate flats,"Love these shoes! These are the second pair I have owned (walked straight thru the first pair.) They are very comfortable and I wear them 2x or 3x per week. I always get great compliments/comments on them from strangers in public and am proud to be seen in them.The price I paid through Amazon.com ($15+) was just right, too."
5,BRIAN IS REALLY BACK,well it may have taken 37 years to get him back on stage but boy was it worth it great songs great band great arrangements brian having fun fun fun again god only knows im thankful
5,Great!,"I think this album is one the greatest live album ever, so much musichistory in one cd is fantstic.....but i have a copy of ""Brian Wilson live at the royal albert hall"" and that is a little bit better i think..."
3,I'm Underwhelmed,"I know I'll catch a lot of heat from loyal fans, but I'm underwhelmed by this new live release. Comprising covers of the Beach Boys greatest hits, that sound as tired and dated as last week's fresh fish, Brian sounds like he's performing under duress. Is Dr. Landy still behind the scenes coaxing and prodding him along? Brian's solo material holds up significantly better. These live versions of Love and Mercy and Lay Down Burden are, for me the highlights of this anemic set.I don't mean to be cruel. Brian's long and sad battle against substance abuse and manic depression have been exhustively chronicled over the years. I for one applaud his courage, in confornting his demons head-on by touring and recording again. I just think his talents would be far better served if he were to concentrate on his writing and producing full time. Song writing and producing have always been his stock and trade and his claim to genius."
5,A nice return to form...,"Forget the giant sandbox, the magic transistor radio... hell, forget ""Smile"" for a minute and just drop these discs into you CD player and *listen* to Brian Wilson sing and play piano! Listen to these songs as if for the first time, listen to his still-supple but no-longer-sacchrine voice, listen to the amazingly empathetic backing band. Seperate the man from the myth, and your are left with a wonderful live performance of some of the greatest songs ever written. The new takes on the ""Pet Sounds"" material are beyond beautiful, Brian's reading of the Barenaked Ladies music-geek anthem ""Brian Wilson"" proves that he is not a fried, drugged-up loony, but a ""with it"" guy with a slightly twisted sense of humor. The recording is nicely done, capturing the ambience of the Roxy nicely with good dynamics and plenty of inner detail. A great album that is full of charms."
3,Some good moments...but...,"A nice effort, and some of the better Brian Wilson we've seen so far. The version of BNL's ""Brian Wilson"" was funny, but dissapointing in it's length. This probably could have been pared down to one disc rather than two. I like the version I taped for myself to listen to in my car better. (I cut out about half of it.)"
4,An introduction to Brian Wilson,"I am not a traditional Beach Boys fan at all. I won tickets to see Paul Simon in concert. Although I am a Paul Simon fan, my wife and I were surprised when we heard that Brian Wilson was the ""back up"" band. I thought to myself, we should check the Brian Wilson set out. He should have been the ""headliner""...as much as I like Paul Simon, the concert highlight was Brian Wilson and his band. I immediately became a fan and bought this cd release. The cd has a nice mix of songs and the band and Brian Wilson put on a good show. He even makes a little fun of his own personal past ""lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did""..."
1,"I think,maybe,I might have had slaves in my family, could be","I was a history major in college and MY professors made me substantiate every premise I made. This book had great promise but fell short of non-fiction. I feel we need books on this subject but this book falls short, filled with conjecture and supposition. I hope the next attempt in this arena has more substance and FACT. By the way, I am not from the South but from Missouri and this book is an insult to all people who publish research."
5,Amazing book!,"The work I've been doing in genealogy made this book quite timely and appropriate for me. I was not researching the Ball family but know that other family were slave owners and so I deeply appreciate the work that Edward Ball did. The writing is enjoyable, the topic fascinating, and a bold work of non-fiction. Makes me want to read more of his thoughtful work."
5,Couldn't Put it Down,"I read this book during a vacation in Hawaii; I found it so compelling I couldn't put it down.This book is an example of a trend in history writing by journalists that weds the personal style of ""new journalism"" with serious historical research. The book is both a ""personal"" account of the Ball family ownership of slaves and a well-researched and thoughtful history of slavery in the United States.Some readers have commented that the book was difficult to read; I thought the writing was elegant and easy to follow - much easier to digest than academic writing. Some readers have felt the book was superficial or self-indulgent on the part of the writer. I didn't find it to be either - the winding of the story made sense and like a good plot led naturally from one part to the next. The research underneath the story was thorough, and the analysis was thoughtful."
2,Strange book.,"The author is a bit too self-indulgent for a book of general interest. About a fourth of the information would be better saved for a Ball family reunion. Another quarter should not be included at all (like the description Ball gives of the old house he stayed in while visiting Charleston). Still, the point of view IS unique and strangely interesting. I would not try to convince someone to read it any more than I would try to talk someone out of reading it. The best part is the oral history of the Ball slave's descendents."
4,"Slavery includes sellers, traders, owners, and owned.",I felt as though I was on a journey with the author. My people came from Ireland in the mid-19th century and I know very little about them. I identified with the humanity of all the dramatis personae in E. Ball's story: owners and slaves alike. I learned a lot about the human condition--of whatever color--and applaud the author's persistance in pursuing his family's paths no matter where they led.
3,heart and soul--all of it,"I agree, this is a fascinating book. Ball takes the reader on an amazing journey of personal and historical discovery. A good edit would have made it a lively story as well."
3,good history - not good reading,"This is an excellent history book, but the writing is not as good. Mr. Ball is a journalist & reading this book is like reading a 500 page newspaper article. The chapters are long & very detailed. I picked this book up for my book group and am glad to have broadened my horizons, so to speak. If you're interested in southern history, this book is good from that perspective - just don't expect a quick and easy read."
5,"I found ""Slaves in the Family"" to be a a truthful book.","Edward Ball's book is wonderful. I do geneology and have been confronted with members of my family who would like certain ""secrets"" kept hidden. However, I am also a Historic Preservationist. I feel that enough has been hidden about Americas past. I also, have ""slaves in my family"" and I am part Native American. These two secrets have remained hidden from certain family lines in their geneology charts. I say ""why""? We are who we are and so are our ancestors. Lets keep researching and writing. I feel the truth will finally bring people together."
3,"Worthwhile, but difficult reading.","Edward Ball's ancestors were the owners of South Carolina rice plantations from about 1700 until 1950. They also owned slaves. This book shows how the Ball family and the slave families lives became so intertwined that the connections last even today. Though it is a chronicle of one family, it is also a chronicle of slavery from the 1700's until slavery was abolished after the Civil War. But it doesn't stop there. Mr. Ball is able to follow some of the former slave families into the present to see how they've fared.Did I like this book? Yes. I happen to like history and I especially like to see how history affects us today. However, I think the book needed more of a chronological presentation. There was too much jumping back and forth, too many names to keep track of, so eventually toward the end of the book I felt overwhelmed. There are many interesting stories in this book that make it worth slogging through, but it is a slog."
4,made our book group think,"Our book group, made up of mainly senior citizens, was unanimous in agreement that this is a book worth reading. We felt it was a little long and tedious in parts. However, we all learned something about slavery and the people involved.We do have two questions--Is the author married? and How did he finance all the traveling involved? Neither of these questions is any of our business, but we are interested. A good book."
2,"interesting, desperately in need of editing","Extremely sloppy editing detracts from what could have been an excellent book. The author is way too interested in superfluous detail -- the descriptions of people and scenery were not necessary and distracting. Although the subject matter was provocative and there is much to admire in the project, the book was ultimately a rather tedious read."
1,"historical researchers ""substantiate"" -- they do not ""assume""","The author assumes many thoughts & actions, usually negative, of his slaveholding ancestors, all without any basis in fact/record...and all to support his politically correct assertion that Southern slaveholding families are unworthy of redemption for their failure to grasp 20th century conventions. As a historian, he seems curiously unable to accurately assess history within its time and place. Some professional counseling, to help him reconcile the politically correct guilt he chooses to carry from ancestors he never knew, might have been more helpful to him...and would have avoided dragging unsuspecting readers through his revisionist struggles."
1,Harvard-Revisionism At Its Worst,"Another classic example of a Southern-born individual pimping out his birthright to Northerners for thirty pieces of silver. The art of letting Northerners gloat about themselves at the expense of Southerners has become rather tiresome, at least it has for the past 130 years. I find it rather queer how Americans in New England & the rest of the North are constantly unwilling to deal with their own racial prejudices, yet have no problem exercising such bigotry against Southerners of all races. If our Northern counterparts truly had no problem confronting their own history as a whole (good & bad), as Southerners do, there would be less racial diviseness in America."

4,Interesting Read,"I thought this was a good read. I especially appreciated the details of the types of Africans that the planters preferred and detested. I recommend this book. Yes, I do agree that the author's writing style was dry. However, I find most books that have a historical base, unless it is fiction, to be dry as cracker."
1,Could have been 1/4 of the length it is.,"I have suffered through about half of this book. The author gets way too bogged down recounting the stories of people that he has happened to find along the way that bear only the most distant relationship to the history he tries to capture. In many instances, the stories are merely filler bearing no relationship to the matter at hand. In most instances, the people interviewed are so many generations removed and their knowledge so sketchy that they are irrelevant. If you have a serious interest in this area, look elsewhere."
5,An elegant and skilled writer tackles a very complex history,"From cover to cover, I could not bear to put this book aside. I found Mr. Ball's writing to be clear, concise and very expressive of his obvious sensitivity and humor. The story of the african-americans was heartbreaking, while the tale of the Balls was infuriating. I learned many things about slavery and about the way the system worked. The detail Mr. Ball went into only made the story more fascinating to me. The task he set out to accomplish would have been intimidating to most people; he certainly risked the scorn of the descendants of his family's slaves. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the South and in the roots of our present-day predicament between the races."
2,"fascinating topic, but slow read","I love non fiction, especially books that take me where I've never gone before. I don't ask for excitement on every page, but I do like to get a sense of a different time or place. This book is excruciatingly exact in details, but they're not details of general, historical interest. True, there are just scraps of information to go by, but they could have been fleshed out by what is known from other sources. Ball limited his book to what he found and what people told him, and painstakingly details what he found and who told him what. This is boring. Who cares whether someone was wearing pressed pants and eating chicken? To his credit, he told a story whose time is long overdue, he just needed a better editor."
2,"Interesting topic & approach, not well executed though","Good subject & interesting approach, but it reads like an exceptionally, exhaustingly long newspaper article. I thought the book was designed for readers with short attention spans & no taste for scholarly history, however well-written. The book has many scholarly-type facts strewn about its pages, in no particular order & with no particular line of argument. But it doesn't seem to bring any startling new & interesting interpretation to these facts. Not quite clear on why a jury thought this was one of the year's best books. But I though ""A Civil Action"" was a similar book that received such critical plaudits too."
4,Longshadows by Kent White,"Having read through this book, twice in less than a year, I continued to find the story drawing me back until I hurried from other duties to finish. The storyline and information reawakened memories of my own experiences of that time, while serving in the Army Special Forces 5th group on an A-team on the Cambodian border. This book will remain in my read again section of the library, where few books earn that respect. My occupation as a pharmaceutical specialties operations manager and educator leads me to respect a good book and author. Thank You, Kent."
1,Nailer,"A piece of junk, Do not buy it. No one has the nails, I finally found some rusted nails that fit they were rusted junk. Spend a few more dollars and get a good nailer."
3,Not her greatest work. And not the CD I thought it was.,Celine is always a great voice to listen to. This wasn't the CD I thought I was buying but it was alright.
4,I must say it rocks. Excellent tribute to JMT.....,"an awesome cd, a defenite must buy for all of you pennywise fans."
1,broke after 13 months,The cd player broke after 13 months of very light use. This is the second Philips product I've owned that has failed prematurely.
2,"Good Movie, Mediocre DVD","What surprises me about this one is that Fox has this title streaming in HD at Vudu, yet instead of using that very nice looking transfer as a source for the DVD release, they've obviously used some old outdated video master that was lying around. The picture quality is OK, but there's quite a bit of video noise in the image. It's not bad, but it should've been better than this.Still, if you want to own this on DVD, here it is and it could have been worse. It should look more tolerable on a smaller television, but projected onto a large screen it's a bit of a strain."
1,No Subtitles,"I give this item only 1 star but that is not because of the movie, I would have given the movie probably 5 stars, but it is because of the lack of subtitles. It's the same all over again. Just as I would have bought a lot of the Warner Archives I also would buy a lot of the 20th Century Fox Archives series, if they only had subtitles. This way I think a lot of people are missing very good movies they otherwise would have bought. There is no other way tomake this clear than by giving 1 star in the hope that the companies should see it and give us subtitles, this could not be so expensive as the price if those bare-boned DVD-R's is expensive enough. And they must realzie there are a lot of peo-ple for who subtitles are necessary. I know I have written this already several times but I hope by repeating it the companies will pay attention, after all I think they would be pleased to sell more of these expensive DVD-R's."
4,all or nothing at all by Joey De Francesco,i want to get text of this song so i can remember can you send it for me. pleaseeee
1,Pathetic,As a member of the Knights I find this work pathetic that someone to make an extra buck will take the sacred and make it public.It shows the authors true intent which was not benefits from his membership but exploiting it for profit.No matter when it was written it still should be taken off of Amazon in respect for the membership of the Knights of Colombus.
1,i made a bad choice,"i thought it should made by steal but it made by plastic with a sticker on that. not a good product, just dont buy it"
1,Not Worth It,I own several apartments and thought this might help speed up doing finish work in tight corners. Wrong! It only slowed things down. I tried everything I could think of including tacking the pieces together to keep them from slipping apart. No amount of tightening of the sandpaper will allow more than a few minutes of sanding before the foam works its way out. Definitely not worth the trouble.
1,pornographic packaging,"This is sold as a health device yet arrives in a box covered with graphic depictions of vaginas and clitorises (Clitori??). No instructions and no returns. Beware, make sure you know what your doing."
3,Best protection but very loud fan!!,"Top of the line protection. Excellent product, but fan is very loud.great if used in dedicated equipment room.Not to heavy & comes with rack mount accessories."
3,ShowerTek Fog Free Shower Mirror - Matte Chrome,"Its not what I thought it would look like. Matte chrome is like a gray looking cheesey plastic. Chrome.....Not! Other than the looks, it works great."
1,Cancelled Order,"Purchased this item on a Friday, with an estimated ship date of3-4 days later. 4th day, received an amazon.com email stating seller no longer had item in stock. Would be FAR more polite to notify a buyer in less than 4 days that a sale is cancelled. Orion Skyview Pro 8 EQ."
2,To sell a book,"I imagined that all writers need to make a living, therefore, They have to be ""Creative"" about the subject matter to penetrate an already saturated Palestinian_Israeli book market. Since, it is very intellectually fashionable to be pro_Palestinian now this book no doubt has been ""packaged"" to sell to this ""new"" audience."
1,Not all Music Fans are correct,"Sorry, Music Fan, but I have to agree with the other reviewer. I bought this CD having heard nothing but wonderful things about Levinson's playing and am incredibly disappointed at the result. After a single listening I took it to a used book store and traded it away. As a Regents' Professor of Piano, I too have played many of these works and am afraid that Levinson's performances are not even up to my students' standards, let alone mine. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this recording. You will only regret it."
5,Interested in Nelson Eddy? Love the songs of Cole Porter?,This book is for you! Indulge yourself in the romance of an operetta written in story form. It's De Lovely!
3,Not that good,"I much preferred Settlers III. This game has the same idea, with scantilcy clad Amazons thrown into the mix.It's hard to figure out, and there is a distinct tendancy for you to get killed quickly, so I was not able to explore anything past the basic advances. You're better off giving this one a miss."
2,Disappointing...also highly out-dated in today's context!,"After a quick perusal, I found this book to be highly out-dated in today's context. Content-wise, it is more of a career planning guide for first timers, & not a systematic comprehensive life/work planning guide as suggested in the secondary title of this book. This was my mistake, as I was attracted by the latter. I originally thought that I could pick up some winning fundamentals of life/work planning.Worst of all, this book used the old-fashioned typewriter fonts, & was printed in a manuscript format, which further aggravated my reading process.Fortunately, my copy is a used one, which I have bought very cheaply from an online shop.On the whole, I have been very disappointed."
2,Has mistakes that no beginer could correct,"While the patterns are all cool looking and generally very simple to make, there are some mistakes that a beginner could not fix on her/his own. To make matters worse, I've searched the net for errata which does not seem to exist."
4,Comforting and Informative,My interest in Angels started when I was a very small child. This book has answered many questions and helped me to better understand the power of Angels and Prayer.
4,A remark,"Hi all, I just wanted to say I just finished reading RUNNING AFTER ANTELOPE and it was a very nice, thoughful, and fast read. I found the idea of his obsession of running after antelope a bit ridiculous, which I am assuming was the point. I've never read, heard, or heard of Scott Carrier before so I have no prior knowledge to help fund my knowledge. I wanted to say though that the pieces about Cambodia, Kashmir, and Mexico were wonderful. They really made me think and if nothing else, I believe that a great writer must have the ability to make you look at life's absurdities, laugh, and ponder deeply about the world around you. Scott Carrier you have succeeded! May you forever run with the antelope!"
4,"S Carrier's ""Running""","Item arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner.The book itself is pretty interesting and funny, and it has that special spark that non-fiction has because this stuff really happened to somebody."
4,Great Comfy Boots!,"These boots are very comfy, warm, stylish and durable. I am going to get another pair in a different color. I have received many compliments on them, and I wear them regularly."
3,Nice Boots,"These boots are great!! I bought them as a gift for my sister-in-law and she said they are the warmest she has ever had. On the other hand, although it has been cold, we have not had snow, so I am not sure how good they are in snow, but beautiful boots none the less."
4,Beautiful in Blue,"This writing instrument has the sophistication and gravitas associated with much, much more expensive products. It feels great in my hand, and looks great sitting on the table in front of me in meetings."
1,Beware -- For Limited 15 Minutes Use Only,"I ordered this mask to check it out and found a warning printed on the sealed aluminized bag cautioning that use is limited to 15 minutes. Unless your intended use is to escape from unsafe point A to safe point B within 15 minutes, this is not for you."
3,A pretty anthology with some big hits by the Oliver Onions,"A nice CD that bring in our CD players the taste of friendship and freedom of some movies by the team Bud Spencer&Terence Hill, and the music of the Oliver Onions. We liked it because there are some big hits, such as the famous Dune Buggy and Flying Trough the Air, and some less known (in USA) track from other film, such as Angels and Beans, and even the song of Rocky Joe, a japanise cartoon. The quality of the music from the original disc is good, with no LP rustles. A must-have for all the fans of Spencer&Hill, waiting for a more comprehensive anthology."
3,Bud and Terence's Greatest Hits,"While there are just a few of their greatest hits on this cd, it is still fun to listen to. The most famous being ""Dune Buggy"" from Watch Out We're Mad is always enjoyable. You may not recognize some of the other songs unless you are a true Bud and Terence purest. I recommend this cd if you can buy it for under $15.00.Hope this helps!"
5,Shape does it AGAIN!!! 138-142 BPM Go HARD!!,"Since there are no details of this CD listed in the item description, I put my faith in SHAPE and ordered this CD not knowing what kind of music was on it. This CD was released Feb. 2003 and is the latest addition to the series.This is GLOBAL DANCE MUSIC! Very fast Very Rhythmic and I did 50 minutes of Cardio just dancing around my living room! It wasnt pretty but Im sure I burned some calories.Songs are Castles in the Sky, Silence, Turn to You, and other dance music favorites. I own all but the slowest of the Shape Fitness Series CD's as I like a nice beat even if I can't keep up yet! Even at the peak of fitness these CD's will still be great to workout to. I recommend them all! Flawless mixes, blended perfection. Can't wait for the next one. If you see a woman at the Gym on the elliptical with a big smile on her face and sweat down her back, it might be me listening to my Shape CD's."
3,Coffee Table Book,"The book had very good photos in. It was definitely a coffee table book, however, there was vast variety of photos that gave a good overview of Finnish life styles."
2,Meh.,"Golden Greats of Horse Racing (Front Row Video, director unknown, 1988)The box promises racing highlights, and, well, highlights is what you get. Golden Greats of Horse Racing resembles (and may well be) a collection of Wide World of Sports three-minute spots on such legends as Johnny Longden, Bill Shoemaker, Secretariat, Affirmed, etc. Forty-five minutes of them.This is definitely not a tape made for horse fans. Secretariat's Belmont run isn't fully shown, only the stretch call; when was the last time you saw that? The quality of the film is often poorer than when you see this same footage on ABC during Triple Crown coverage (or on TVG whenever); you'd do better to grab a blank tape, get the list of personalities shown here, and compile a tape of them yourself from TV broadcasts. *"
1,Armband for my Zune,"I ordered this product from the GreatGuys on the 1st of January. Well they have proved to be not so great. In fact they never delivered. Wrote to them after the due date, but they never responded. The order is now with Amazons Claim dept. I wouldn't put my trust with the GreatGuys as they have proven to me that there not so great! I finally received a refund from them on February 3rd."
2,blue-ray?,I have been watching this series on blue-ray. First 2 discs were actual blue-ray quality. 3rd disc is like a bad dvd print. I felt ripped-off.
5,Must See!!,one of the best shows on television. I am so happy I have BBC America.I never would have known about this treeific show!!!
2,Not what I was expecting.,"I usually enjoy BBC series. That's why I decided to give ""Robin Hood"" an opportunity. After watching the 1st episode, the characters were very weak and the story wasn't appealing. I won't download the 2nd episode."
3,Misleading info,"I am a little upset about this item I recently purchased on Amazon. I read the description and was glad to see that the languages listed included Spanish. Since this was supposed to be a present for my non English speaking father I thought I had score big with this series.Once the package arrived (on time as usual) I was anxious to give the present away, just to be called later on to be told that it did not have any other language options but English. I understand that this is a BBC series and English is the original language, however I trusted Amazon description of the product. So thanks Amazon for misleading this trusting shopper. I end up with a present for myself with this one.I have just started watching and the series looks amazing, just wish I can share it with the intended recipient."
2,Not impressed,"I am disappointed by this new series, Robin Hood. I think the writing and the humor is immature and I was not convinced that the main actor fit the role of Robin. I also feel that Marion could have been better cast. Richard Armitage, who plays Sir Guy, plays his role very well. In fact, I would have preferred him as Robin! I wish I could have enjoyed this DVD set, but I just couldn't."
2,Horrid...,"This show is terrible...bad acting, bad writing, bad costumes, bad fight choreography....View the worst episodes of Hercules or Xena from a couple of years ago and you get the general idea of what this series is like. If you want to see how a Robin Hood series should be done, go view Robin of Sherwood, which is also out on DVD now.."
2,"Kinder, gentler, PC Robin Hood","This offering from BBC Video is quite possibly the worst Robin Hood ever. The legend has been rewritten to serve as political commentary (i.e., propaganda) disguised as an action series. Robin and his men are terrorists according to the Sheriff who is also fond of prattling on about the need for law and order and etc., etc., etc. The fight scenes more resemble the ""rumbles"" between the Sharks and the Jets in ""West Side Story"" than medieval combat. As if all this were not bad enough, we also have shallow characters and poor acting. All things considered, this telling of Robin Hood is disappointing and one to avoid unless they pay you to watch it. You might instead try the ""Robin of Sherwood"" series, it was made in the early 80's before television became castrated by political correctness."
4,'A different kind of hood',"I have been watching this series on BBC America and anticipate each new episode. This show is geared towards a modern and younger audience, but I think that anyone open-minded enough will enjoy it. It may not be historically accurate, but if you suspend disbelief you will fall in love with the actors and the comical aspects of the show. I am at episode six and the show has found its flow. The first few episodes spend time to set up subplots and characters, and it is worth it. Marian is wonderful in this version of RH. I think she brings a streghth that really is a good role-model image for younger girls. She can take care of herself and doesn't hesitate to go into action to protect the people around her. The tagline for the show was 'a different kind of hood', BBC means every word. It is new, creative, and better than reality tv. Everyone should check out this show."
2,Just OK,"This is a pretty cheesy series. But I did watched all three seasons, so it does kind of hook you. The plots are pretty lame, and many many times it is completely unbelievable. They (the robin hood gang) are constantly getting into impossible situations and then escaping too easily. The villains aren't believably bad.I did like the ending, but if I could do it over, I wouldn't have wasted my time."
4,New Robin Hood,"It's a little different from the Robin Hood I knew as a child. It's fast paced, funny at times. My wife and I enjoyed it a lot."
2,eh... forest cami's...,"Eh, it was good until I saw that parts of it didn't fit.. Like for the fact when the hell did they have forest cami's in old england? really? Who's idea was it for that one, cause that completely turned me off. All of it was great! However, I saw that and couldn't watch it anymore. It just completely ruined it for me.If you like it, more power to you, however, I will no longer watch it because of that one little flaw, although there might be more, I stopped watching as soon as I figured out what it was that wouldn't stop bugging me, and that happened to be it."
5,Blue Flu,"This episode reminded me of the ""Blue Flu"" that we see here in the states! I love that there are twists and turns. RObin Hood was a brillant strategist."
3,Three is the average,"What an odd little show. They've chosen the actors well, mingling the adventure of Robin Hood with some well-timed humor, especially in their villains. They clearly have some script authors who are better than others. Compare, for example, episode 10, ""Peace? Off!"" with episode 11, ""Dead Man Walking."" While 10's theme had plenty of places to go, its execution turned into the ridiculous, undermining its message. 11 took the theme and ran with it, developing characters logically with a script that allowed the characters a new depth. That dichotomy is pretty typical for the show. On the bright side, even when the plot lines strain believability to the max, these actors carry off making it fun and entertaining. Kudos to them all. One final criticism, borrowed from our good sheriff: A clue--costuming."
2,"The show is great, but I can't download it to my tablet.","I wanted to purchase this and many other shows from Amazon to download to my tablet for when I am long flights. I could find no way to down load it, It resides in my amazon cloud which is useless for my needs."
4,"Terribly wonderful, wonderfully terrible","From a historical point of view, this show is aweful. At one point, a soldier comes back from the Crusades wearing camo-pants and combat boots.But the superb cast and characters can't help but draw you in and keep you entertained. Not to mention, easy on the eyes. The shows take on Robin Hood being a wry charmer with a bow legged swagger instead of the usual square jawed rugged hero was an interesting choice that paid off. And Guy of Gisborn was strangely sympathetic and so well played that when I found out the actor had gone on to M-I 5, I started watching that show as well. The Sheriff of Nottingham was completely unsympathetic, but I still loved watching him.If you can let go of historical accuracy and strong plot devices and just let yourself be entertained by great performers and fun writers for awhile, this show is worth your while."
5,the hood,"Highly recommended. Very well made and a brilliant cast. Armstrong is excellent as Robin Hood and the beautiful Lucy Griffiths is a great Marian. The series is very entertaining and this set is a must for any Robin Hood fan. Lots of action, suspense, and drama. Probably the best telling of the Robin Hood legend ever."
2,Miss,"Bad show. Too cutsey and disney-ish. Would be better if it had more of an edge. Maid Marion is a pill and I'm sorry, but being able to hit an object the size of a quarter with an arrow from half-a-mile away is just silly. There is only so much reality one can suspend."
1,"Pacifist, OMG How stupid is that",This is the stupidest Robin Hood I have ever seen. There is no possible way he could be a pacifist. Also he could never beat up Sir Guy.
2,Robin Hood season 1 .,"I wasn't happy when I got the item & it didn't have a cover .The picture displayed a cover.It never said that it didn't have the cover.I think you should of said ""cover is missing"""
4,Enjoyable and funny,"""Robin Hood - Season One""(BBC-TV)---------------------------------------This modern, 21st Century spin on the classic Robin Hood legend is pretty fun. If you enjoyed purposefully cheesy action series such as ""Xena"" and ""Hercules,"" there's a good chance you'll like this series, too. Robin and his merry men all develop their personalities fairly slowly, but there's one great character straight out of the gate, and that's Keith Allen's magnificently twisted, puckishly evil Sheriff of Nottingham, a performance that has a lot of Tim Curry in it, but also its own unique charm. I was leery of this show after seeing some of the more critical reviews, but not that I've watched Season One, I'm totally on board. It's not great art, but it is a fun show. Plus, I'm a sucker for Robin Hood stuff anyway, so what's not to love? Definitely worth checking out. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
5,ROBIN HOOD!!!!!!!!!!!,"I followed the show when it was on BBC America. My favorite character is Guy of Gisborne, a complex man, played brilliantly by the handsome Richard Armitage. Jonas Armstrong plays a believable Robin and Lucy Griffiths plays the saucy wench, Marian, who treads a fine line, pretending to be loyal to Guy while actually helping Robin. Things heat up as the seasons go on and the acting gets better and better. Keith Allen sometimes overdoes it with his jokes, but he is a funny character. This set is expensive, but I thought it was worth it."
2,Not good,"I'm sorry, but this series is just not that good. I have watched all three series, so I'm not giving my opinion from having only watched a couple of episodes. To keep it short, every episode feels almost exactly like the one that came before it; or after it for that matter. The Sheriff kidnaps someone; Robin Hood and his merry band attempt a daring rescue - episode. The Sheriff has some hidden gold; Robin Hood and his merry band attempt to steal it, daringly of course - episode. The Sheriff lures Robin Hood and his merry band into town; surprise! It's a trap! Daring escapades ensue - episode. And on and on it goes, over and over again. Episode after episode. I would not have watched the entire series, but did so because I am a completionist. I took one for the team. So save yourself the time and save yourself the torture by not watching this crap. You'll be glad you didn't."
1,Terrible,"Robin Hood, hero of medieval England. Should be good, right? But this show is so badly filmed, and so badly directed, that its character and mood are completely out of place. I keep expecting Robin Hood to pull out a SmartPhone and update his FaceBook status. As a photographer, I know good lighting, and this show is not well lit. The lighting is flat and obvious. The actors are equally without depth. I feel like I'm watching British teenagers in fancy dress. It just isn't believable."
1,A BAD RETELLING,"When this series first aired, I thought the producers would capture some of the emotive essence of the original tales. Sadly I was wrong. The casting is almost completely inappropriate, with youngsters of the wrong character (for the tales) coupled with banal scripting, make this a complete turn-off, although it has to be said that some of the photography and screenplay is worthy of a look.If you are looking for a good retelling of the Robin Hood legends, the best by a country mile is the series ""Robin of Sherwood"". Although that one was made in the 80s? the characterisation, screenplay and script of the Carpenter production make it stand out as being way ahead of all the others.Don't waste your money on this Robin Hood series."
5,Robin Rocks,Want some HOT people with your fairey tale? This is the show for that. Richard Armitage alone is worth the price of the DVD(s).
3,Robin Hood Season 1,"This is fun and funny. Enjoyable characters, lots of Matrix type action with bows and arrows mixed with lots of good dialogue"
1,Not even worth $20 new.,"There's a reason this is available for $20 new, you get what you pay for, or in this case not even that. At that price I thought I'd give it a try, expecting something at least matching the quality level of Legend of the Seeker. Boy was I wrong. What a horrible waste of time. Tedious, repetitive scripts, cheap sets, and horrendous editing, to name just a few of its many negatives. What an unexpected let down from a modern BBC series.I've been an Amazon customer for a long time and this is the first review I've written. I felt it was my duty to warn others to avoid this tripe. Don't be fooled by the inexplicably positive reviews or the interesting cover art, this is junk."
3,Some problems,I had some problems and got the wrong season- not Season one which was what I ordered. But that was corrected in the week. But the copy I got has some glitches in it on one of the disc- even after a couple of good cleanings. Otherwise the program is very entertaning.
1,takes political correctness to a whole new level,"The series sure makes you miss Errol Flynn. It is packed full of violins and bloodshed, I believe I saw someone skin their knee. The only fatalities in this series is when Robin and the sheriff talk their audience to death. So politically correct you want to run out and vote Democratic. The sets and the scenery are nice, but I'm 66 years old now, and I don't want to see a Robin Hood I could beat the snot out of. Richard Greene made a more believable Robin Hood, at least he shot people. Well, back to the series, I believe I'll start rooting for the Sheriff of Nottingham."
3,eh,"Fans of Hercules and Xina will most likely enjoy this show. I find it a little to predictable, follows the Hollywood formula too closely"
1,Will you tolerate this? I couldn't.,"I really wanted to like this show until 10 minutes in- They showed thr clothier and his wayward daughter, and I got distracted..she had perfect overly white teeth, breast implants, bleach blonde hair and MAC style makeup... This production has no attention to detail and it shows... I think I saw Robin's long sleeve Tee at Target.Wardrobe and makeup aside, I just couldn't get into the shallow story lines and predictable plot. I really expected more from this.. But it certainly more corny than classic."
1,Worst Action Series Ever!,"Horrible drivel, the plots frequently don't make sense, characterizations are flat and one dimensional, logic is left by the wayside, poor acting, and a heavy dose of Politically Correct garbage. They don't even try to achieve historical accuracy, African Nobles in Nottingham, Muslim slaves in England, and on and on. Anything as long as the villains are; Christians, men, white people, merchants, lawmen, aristocracy, and on and on...""We don't punish thieves, the Sherriff does that,"" pearls of wisdom from Robin, after villagers capture thieves robbing their village, and then he lets them go, so they can rob Marion's home...Add amateurish-unconvincing dialogue and even more dreadful fight scenes (Robin fighting holding a baby looks so bad as to embarrass the audience for watching), makes this my pick for ""Worst Action Series Ever""!"
5,Great Show,"I have always been a fan of british TV shows - this is a very good drama, great acting, humor and story lines."
1,What highschool theatre club made this movie?,"Not true to story.Interjects modern thought and financial arguments pertaining to democratic republics, ie. propaganda.This is no-where near close to the true tale of Robin Hood.One more ""powerpoint"" arrow sound with the captions, and I'll be convinced a 12 year old made this.Also...all the women wear makeup only found in this century.What a complete joke, I didn't even watch the entire first episode."
3,disjointed,"I got this movie because of Kristanna Loken. Unfortunitly the movie was disjointed. With the insane asylem scenes interspirsed throughout the whole movie. It got to be a distraction rather than a clever gimic. Kristanna did a fine job, one of her best. The rest of the cast was mediocre."
3,Jordan charm,"Product was nice, writting a bit small, but not much can be done about that. Arrived quickly and was a create price."
5,PIT BULL,"Any toy that a pit bull can't rip to pieces in a few hour is quality. My dog has torn up those ""Tough Balls"" and the Kong toys easily. Nyalabone is a quality product"
2,my dogs weren't into it,"this is a really hard toy - no give to the plastic, so my dogs totally ignore it. if your dog likes to chew on screw drivers or something maybe they'd dig it"
5,Great for Power Chewers!,I have a 3 year old Doberman who loves to chew. Nylabone products are the only products he doesn't destroy. He especially likes the double action dental ball cause it's a ball and a bone in one. He carries it around with him where ever he goes!
4,"Great bone, very durable.","My dog got a bone like this for Christmas several years ago, before we had kids, and she really liked it a lot. It lasted quite awhile, too. She is a 35 pound Australian Cattle dog that really likes to chew. Now that we have kids, I wanted to get something for the dog besides rawhide (because the little rawhide pieces kept getting left on the floor for the baby to pick up). The bone works great. The only drawback is that it is pretty sharp and scratchy after having been chewed on, so I have to make sure the kids don't toss it around or throw it on the leather couches. Other than that, I'm glad that it doesn't leave pieces all over the carpet, and that it is more interesting to my dog than a standard Nylabone. We also got the green one with the cylindrical center, and the dog likes that one, too."
2,"I like it, pup doesn't","I got this for my teething four month old german shepherd puppy. She was interested in it for 15 minutes when I first gave it to her but hasn't been back to it since. I'm hoping she'll get interested in it again because I really like the center part for her to chew on. So far however, it was a pretty expensive 15 minutes."
3,hmm,"my dog didn't like this. its really hard plastic, doesn't seem like its for chewing. so it doesn't clean her teeth since she wont use it! she went and buried it, haven't seen its since!"
1,Teeny tiny toy--great big disappointment!,"I thought this would be a good-sized chew toy, as it's purported to be for powerful chewers and is labeled ""regular"" size. Other reviews claiming dobermans, etc., couldn't destroy it added to that perception of the toy's size.Imagine my surprise at having this little bit of nothing show up on my doorstep. It's rated for dogs up to 25 lbs., something the package doesn't clearly show and the product description leaves out. This toy should be labeled ""small"", not ""regular"", and the description amended to clearly state what size dog it's designed to suit.No way will my 55 lb. collabradoodle get this--it's too small to be safe for her. It's also not worth the postage cost to return it. Maybe my neighbors' mini dachshund will like it.Given the size of the toy, the price is not good. I've found the larger sizes for a buck or so more at the discounters."
2,For Beginners,I was hoping for more technical coverage of why and how to trim the jib. This book is more for a beginner sailor. I did not learn anything new and I am not an expert sailor.
4,Actiontec Wireless Combination Device,"This is an excellent modem-router-wireless unit. The only drawback from not rating it 5 stars is its range. I had the unit downstairs with only a couple of corners/walls between my laptop and often would only get two bars on the signal strength. First unit failed after 9 months of continuously being on. Actiontec promptly diagnosed the problem and I had another one in three days. For a combo unit, this is a good one and Tech spt is top notch. I have owned these units for two years."
4,Critical study of the presidential Library system.,"This book compares the various modern presidents' efforts to construct their own public memory. These modern, self-promoted presidents are compared as a group compared to Lincoln who occupies the first chapter. Though Lincoln was directive of his image, it became iconic after his death. Modern presidents construct their images directly before they die through the Presidential Libraries."
4,Terrific gift book for any LSU grad,"When professional soldier William Tecumseh Sherman brought his military experience and organizational skills to Pineville in November 1859 as superintendent of Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy, the seventy students who greeted him found him strict in discipline but approachable and able to put them at ease. The University is now home to more than 31,000 students and it?s doubtful that the chancellor knows many of them by name. A great many graduates, however, will want to peruse this gorgeous volume, both for the well-written text and for the scores of glossy photos. From the Civil War and Reconstruction and the school?s frequent moves to new locations, to black-stockinged coeds dancing during halftime at a 1920 game, to streaking and Tiger Stadium and Mike the mascot, you?ll find it all here."
4,Another winner for Haines,"My first introduction to Carolyn Haines was her novel Touched, which I absolutely loved and rated a 5. I thoroughly enjoyed Summer of the Redeemers as well, but not quite as much, so I rated if a 4. This is one talented and gifted writer, and I look forward to reading more from her."
1,very disappointing,"I bought this book at a remaindered book sale and I can see why it didn't sell. I am a huge fan of southern authors, but this book is far below the quality of people I'm used to reading - Ellen Gilchrist, Richard Ford, Bobbie Ann Mason, etc. I thought t was forced - at times Bekkah sounded 12, at other times 35. The characters were very unrealistic. Effie, for instance, varied between being a mindless piece of fluff to a responsible, enlightened citizen with a social and moral conscience. Nadine, Alice, Greg were so stereotypical as to be one-dimensional. I only finished this because I wanted to find out the ending. The mystery was alluded to on the first page and resolved at the end, but lots of what went on didn't further the story or heighten the mystery. I suppose this is intended to be a coming of age story, but it's been done so much better by so many others - Carson McCullers, for instance."
5,real life,"There's a great story at the heart of this book, but what really makes it compelling is the way the author places the story in the context of a whole life... all the various connections with family and friends, and even with people who begin as total strangers but get pulled in some way into Berkson's quest. I could have read this in one sitting but preferred to dole it out over the course of three nights just to savor the experience."
5,Never Give Up!,"Anyone who has ever owned a classic car knows there is a bond between man and machine that comes with it, whether it is Corvette or a classic of lesser prestige. That bond can drive one to extremes when thieves try to separate the two. The extremes Berkson went to would be perfectly understandable--anywhere but New York, where the fate of a stolen car is usually sealed within hours of its disappearance. Yet he refused to accept the idea that his car was never going to be found in one piece, and his determination to find it by appointing himself chief investigator in the face of police indifferance put him on a path that your average New Yorker would never have the guts to follow, especially with the odds of success being somewhere around zero.Berkson writes in a straightforward, fast paced style that makes this book both a quick and compelling read. And -- oh yeah -- he got the car back, but you'll have to buy the book to find out how. Highly recommended."
4,Great read!,This book is a terrific read. Not only for Corvette lovers (I highly recommend in that case) but for all who love their cars. I think we can all relate to the many feelings discussed in the book which is one of the reasons it is so captivating and hard to put down. I told my husband about it and he read it in one night (and he is not a reader - but he liked this one!). Don't wait to get this one - you'll enjoy each page!
5,Great Recording but revealing,"Great recording! It's interesting to hear Corelli in his late prime. The voice is still strong, but he's very sloppy with timing and care for the score. Milnes has a great young sound but is already scooping his top notes. The one to hear is Siepi. His voice is 100% mature. It's lower range is as dark as night. If you are a Siepi fan, this is a must have."
4,"Good Book, Terrible development environment.","Effective Visualage for Java covers well all the aspects of this incredibly terrible IDE. If you have to use VisualAge, this is the book to get you started. How a great programming language like Java could get shackled with such a deplorable development tool is beyond me."
5,Best Source For Exam,"As a Sun Certified Programmer,I recommend this book for Visual Age Java exam,even for version4.Yesterday, I passed the exam with 90%.I like this a book.Thanks to Scott Stanchfield and thanks John Wiley & Sons."
4,short descriptions,"very brief descriptions of greek gods and goddesses, nymphs and satyrs, cyclops and other mythical beings. There is not much here for longer stories or exploits. Its really more like a dictionary of the gods, but as such it is very complete"
1,Waste of money,"Presented to be clever and witty, the publisher is only half right. This is a half-wit book not worthy of 8.85 plus shipping. Bob, trying to capture the Key West mystique, turns out to be the very type real KWpeople try to avoid. Don't waste your money on 80 pages of nonsense."
5,"funny,factual,great picture of key west life","everyone all over the country, will enjoy bob.after having lived in kw for 20 years, its a pleasure to see a really funny and visual picture of key west life. Be sure to read it, its a high point in a low day."
5,money well spent,"This is a great magazine, very informative and helpful when looking to buy items. While I don't always pick their choice, it helps to avoid lesser rated items/brands that I might have been tempted to buy."
5,Love it,Cant loose with the magazine...everything you need to know it at your finger tipsmakes buying items much easyier...once you order it you will understand why....plus now you dont need to go to the library anymore...
5,For the Price Mavens,"I love consumer report.For all of those whom spend hours researching what product is the best value, works the best, or is the cheapests - this magazine does all the work for you!Every issue that comes out I find out new facinating things that I wish I knew sooner and allows me to be a better informed consumer. Things that I have been unable to make decisions about for months are solved by this magazine.Buying this magazine is worth it because of the money it helps you save in the long run!"
4,Pros and Cons,"Pros:They tell you what to look for when shopping for an item, along with reliability ratings.Cons:They send out subscription renewal notices 6 months in advance, taking advantage of people, especially seniors, with poor memories."
2,Not the best,"It seems a bit outdated and out-of-touch, if you ask me. They seem to come out with sensational claims about iPads overheating and iPhones with antenna issues, but they really seem to be blowing things out of proportion instead of helping consumers. FOr example, the iPad temperature sounds hot the way they report it, but it actually seems much cooler than a lot of laptops."
5,GREAT STUFF!,"This has to be the most objective, informative consumer magazine of all time. Caveat Emptor. Be an informed consumer. I can't count the number of products I've purchased based upon CR's recommendations-- and 99% of the time they are dead-on in their analysis. It's hard to place value on making the right purchase decision-- but the peace of mind alone is worth the subscription price."
5,informative,"Consumer Reports is very informative. They test out different products and write up a review about them, the cool thing is they care about quality and not the brand name. I'd suggest this magazine if you frequently buy things and need to have a guide to inform you which product is the best. Sometimes the issues are filled with stuff that might not interest you, but don't give up because each month is different and overall its a very helpful magazine. This is one of those magazines where I keep the issues for a few months to refer back to when I am ready to make a purchase."
4,"Great Mag, but no web access with subscription!",This is a great magazine but you haft to pay $19 more for access the their web page results. Subscription should come with consumerreports.org access.Aaron
3,Decent Guide,"I subscribed for my mother as she's always reading reviews about different products. She seems to swear by it and has enjoyed receiving it.Just an FYI; it can take up to two (2) months before the first issue arrives after subscribing. This was a partial gift for my mom, but didn't make it there in time (a month after) for her birthday."
3,You have to take the good with the bad,"I've subscribed to consumer reports for a few years and overall I enjoy reading it. The reviews and articles on TV's, dishwasher detergent, cameras, etc... are a good resource. Of course it's good to also consult reviews on sites like Amazon and CNET to get other opinions on technology products. The one thing I can't stand is the liberal slant that is obvious when writing on topics like health care and consumer safety. They're always in favor of government solutions to everything, bigger government, more government involvement in our lives, government is great, businesses can't be trusted, businesses are out to screw you, etc... There are times I want to scream because I feel like I'm reading the Democrat party talking points disguised as Consumer Reports magazine. I'm sure every writer there is 100% liberal."
4,This tape is for those who don't know anything about soccer.,"I read some of the reviews on this tape before I purchased it. Some gave it great reviews, others hated it. I know why. If you know the basics of soccer, this tape is not for you. In my case it was very helpful. The information provided is instructionally sound. I now watch professional games and see why they call it 'the simple game'. This video works for me."
1,This is the worst video to buy if you know about soccer,"This video showed some fundamentals, however, if you are very familiar with soccer. I'll suggest you don't spend your money on this video. This video might be good for new coaches that are not all familiar with soccer."
2,Only for a 1st time coach,"I've been coaching for several years and always like to refresh my current knowledge base with new thoughts and ideas. If you fit this profile, this IS NOT the book for you. This video is just too simplistic for anyone that has played the game of soccer, coached, assisted or watched a lot of the soccer on television. I was hoping for another perspective on instep kicks, throw-ins, formations or something and it just wasn't here. That said, if you have never played or coached this is probably a useful video."
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"As a first time coach, I thought this would be a great way to get some drills for the kids to do. NOT ... If you have seen your kids play in one soccer game, you are already too advanced for this video. My kids could have put together a better training video. Stick with the books..they are much better and have more ideas"
4,2 Morricone Italian Westerns From 1968.,"Ennio Morricone is a compulsive soundtrack writer and these 2 recordings on 1 CD continue his earlier Italian Westerns.Of the 2, Face To Face is Ok, A Professional Gun is much better.It has his trademark whistlerling, which is fantastic and some Mexican singing, which is rough to say the least.The main theme returns again and again, it's hauntingly attractive.This may not be up there with The Good, The Bad & The Ugly, but then nothing is really !"
2,Poor (re)mastering,"Unfortunately, the introductory track on this disc -- the main title of ""Il mercenario"" -- has significant distortion during the trumpet performances.Since I've heard other releases that contain this track with excellent sound quality -- e.g.Kill Bill Vol. 2track (incorrectly?) titled ""L'arena"" -- I conclude there must be something wrong with this particular release.I've skimmed the other tracks, and don't notice any other distortions like that on track 1, but haven't delved into it in great detail. Given the content covered, this dual-album may be a good value if you're not aiming for pristine audio quality."
1,Does not serve its purpose and is poorly designed,"I was looking for a CD case that was not bulky, but protected the CDs inside. Unfortunately, this product met the first criteria, but utterly failed the second. Because of the slim profile of the case, the peg that hold the CD prevents the case from closing entirely, leaving the sides totally exposed. As a result, the cases looked cheap, poorly designed, and did not offer much protection to the CD inside. I returned the product for something else."
2,there are better,"I would not recommend this product, I would recommend DiscSavers. DiscSavers are made of the same material but close and lock way better."
1,Verbatim 93975 TRIMpak CD Clear Storage Cases 200-Pack,"Extremely disappointed with the quality of this product ! ! ! DO NOT BUY ! ! !Most of the cases didn't snap lock (stay closed) causing the cover to open while handeling. I purchased this product last year, and found the quality much better than this year's inventory."
5,Mathy indi/emo...really under appreciated....,"This is one of the few ""indie/emo"" albums that I still listen to and appreciate. FSF embraces both soft and ethereal sonic elements as well as loud, harsh, and angry ones. As opposed to many of these other so called ""emo"" bands that are mawkish, whiny, petty, and narcissistic; FSF seems to have a genuine interest in expressing life as they see it, in an artful sometimes abstruse.The instrumentation is nearly ""math"" like, or complex: plenty tempo changes, angular melodies that not only sound good but can catch you off guard, difficult guitar work... The lyrics are very abstract and may take some time to figure out, but it is possible, and strangely rewarding. If you appreciate poetic if somewhat obfuscated lyrics, soft/loud/screaming dynamics, and a sophisticated approach to instrumentation for this genre, I think you should give this album some serious consideration."
2,what happened to depth,"This album is disappointing. It lacks the lyrical depth of The Moon is Down. The guitar is still awesome, but not as distinct as The Moon is Down. Overall, The Moon is Down is a much better album for those of you who crave meaning and relation in lyrics. Also, check out Dashboard Confessional... Chris Carrabba is amazing with words."
2,...,"Honestly, I dont know why everyone is jonesing over this band. I bought this one giveing it every chance in the world. Sure the lyrics are good, But all of the songs follow a similair inharmonious tone. It gets real old real fast. The new vocal guy does a MUCH better job than Chris Carrabba did but, it doesn't do much for this album. I listened to ""The Moon is Down"" still couldn't figure out why everyone liked these guys, This one totally hasn't changed my mind in any shape or form. Don't by this unless you have some twisted taste for bad music.2 stars just because they recruited a singer to fit their....style?"
1,Insincerity as a band name,"The title of my review says it all. This is not the Further Seems Forever of The Moon Is Down. My one star review is not a comment on the band's new singer or style. I haven't listened enough to the new songs to judge that. I'm just warning people not to expect anything similar to the band's earlier work. I don't know why they didn't just change their name, because if I didn't know better I'd say the music from The Moon Is Down and How to Start a Fire had been written and performed by completely different bands."
2,Its just not very good.,"I really liked the moon is down, and Im not really comparing this directly to that album. Further seems forever have completely redone their sound on how to start a fire and it sounds newer and seems to keep with the trends of where punk is going, but they just dont seem to implement their talent very well. Another reviewer said that its more screamy and I agree but it sounds more like a new age dream theater than a another thursday. The lyrics I really didnt like either, I felt they were trying to be really deep but just didnt pull it off, sounds like bad poetry. Overall I was disappointed."
3,a wicked cd,"i cant believe yu people! Yu put dashboard confessionals with FURTHER SEEMS FOREVER?! D/c is the worst band...besides good charlotte.i mean c'mon FSF is the best band...besides all my other faves. Ive listened to emo/punk for the longest time, and this is just crazy! This band is awesome and wicked and crazy and kinda poppy. But besides that, its sick. Another band yu should definitely support would be stars hide fire. DO NOT CONFUSE GOOD MUSIC WITH BAD ONES!!! this is one of the better ones. Thanks."
5,...Chris who?,"I must say, as a fan of FSF's first record ""The Moon is Down"", I am utterly blown away by ""How to Start a Fire"". Paralleled only by Thursday's ""War All the Time"", this is by far the greatest album released all year.With the departure of Chris Carrabba, I feared the worst for Further Seems Forever. However, I can now honestly say that new vocalist Jason Gleason is a FAR better fit for this unique and talented band.I simply can't get enough of this album. My top picks are ""I Am"" and ""The Sound"". Anybody who doesn't own this little piece of gold should drop what they're doing and go buy it immediately."
1,Umm... yeah... good album title? ....,"One spin of this steaming pile and one can understand why it wasn't entitled How To Make a Good Album. We're glad you boys know how to start a fire, someone e-mail me when they know how to record a good record."
4,good listen,The best thing that ever happened to this band was when that tool from dashboard left to pursue a 'solo' career. Since his departure and the arrival of their new singer they have gotten considerably better...I like their new direction and the singing voice is way sweeter.
2,Mmmmm.....ediocre,"Okay, so about a year ago I bought this CD after much thought and deliberation, I listened to stuff from the moon is down and I loved it, but turns out they got a new singer who IS good, but they music and singing just get monotonous. It just is completely the same. They are releasing a new CD very soon, and they got the sense field singer, which is a good band, so maybe he'll bring some fresh blood into the band that was previously mono-emo.I should've bought the moon is down. I tried hard to like this CD, I really did. I have pulled it out numerous times after i bought it (a year ago) and still dont like it. Didn't grow on me. Lets see how the new CD shapes up."
2,Chris Carrabba- The Band's Neccesity,"when i first heard 'wearing thin' off of FSF's cd Moon is Down, i was blown away. i could not stop listening to the song. i heard more songs and grew to like the band. after a while i had heard that chris left to do dasboard. i went out and bought this cd without listening to one song... that was a mistake. on the previous cd, carrabba brought life to the band with his powerful vocals and the music was much more upbeat. with this album it was not that way. no dont get me wrong, jason can sing.. but as for the musical part.. there is none. this album really slowed down to a more mellow tone compared to Moon is Down, with an except to one song, 'Pride War'. Thismade me regret buying the cd. if youre into mellow music- or the exact opposite of Moon is Down... buy this cd."
2,F.S.F. Turned Into Mediocre Radio Rock,"Yeah, the new singer can sing, but there is a definate lack of depth to the lyrics. If you enjoyed Further Seems Forever due inpart to the contribution of Chris, you may be let down by this new installment. The heart and the spark of the band left when Chris left for Dashboard Confessional."
1,"Horrible, Terrible......Save your money","If you want to know what this Album sounds like? Okay, take their first album (Moon is down), Make carraba's voice a little more winier (if possible) and make the songs sond exactly the same, and there you go. It does not even sound like they tried to grow as a band at all, like they tried to duplicate their old album. No thought was placed into it, no creativity, no time, and it shows. You can buy it if you are a hardcore FSF fan, but then again those people probably already have it. I would give this album 0 stars if I could."
3,eh..,this cd has its ups and downs. its not my favorite but its good to listen to every now and then
3,The middle of two extremes,"Everyone needs to relax. Yes, this is not the same FSF we knew in their last release, but it is still a quality group. In The Moon is Down, FSF had an unforgettable group of songs that can't be matched by a later FSF album, and, in my opinion, Chris was a better leader for them. But i won't be hasty and say that this album [isn't good] because its not exactly like the old one. Its a good album, no doubt, and just because it is different does not make it better, or worse. If you like FSF because of The Moon is Down, dont get it. If u want a good emo album, from a still developing band, get it."
4,"pretty good, start to finish","i eagerly awaited this ablum... looking forward to listening the new material they had put together. i had seem them live a couple times in the summer/fall of '02 (in FL, before i moved to TN), and had seem them numerous times during the strong arm years. they always bring a good live show. this cd has some good rock grooves. my favorite so far is: against my better judgement. coming from the success of the group's first album, many would figure it to be too difficult to come back in solid and true form, which they have done brilliantly. only reason i didn't rate this a 5/5 is at times it was difficult to distinguish some of the riffs through the over-amplified distortion... if they had softened some of that distorton, many of the songs would truly shine- holding their rock banner high. heck, and for 10 bucks,it's worth it anyway. get it."
2,Boarding school adventures,"A 16-year-old Navy brat heads off to the Maryland boarding school her mother and grandmother attended, intent on having a good time and living up to their warm memories of the place. Her hot temper and tendency to dismiss people get her into trouble, but she quickly befriends the class leaders and has a good old-fashioned time learning to ride."
3,Really???,"I thought this was going to be a new Shrek/Monsters vs. Aliens halloween special. The first two episodes are new. The pigs episode was ok, but not that great. The monsters vs. aliens episode was really good and would make this the only reason for buying this. The third episode, the Shrek episode, was a real let down. It is the Shrek 3D movie that came with the Story so far collection which included Shrek, Shrek 3D, Shrek 2, and a bonus disc. It is supposed to happen between Shrek and Shreknew 2. I really wish they could of put out something new. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the Monsters vs Aliens episode."
4,Enjoyable,"This DVD contains three episodes: The Night of the Living Carrots (Monsters vs. Aliens characters), The Pig Who Cried Werewolf, and The Ghost of Lord Farquad (both Shrek characters). Kids (ages 4 & 9) both enjoyed these new episodes. I'd also recommend the previous releases of Scared Shrekless & Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space (available in a combo pack) as short DVD treats for Halloween fun."
3,This was okay,"It was not worth the money. I bought this for our family and my three year old. she liked it okay, but thankfully it is not on the repeat 100 times a day list."
2,does the job but gets me sick to my stomach,"This definitely aids you where you need it but it gets me sick to my stomach (I never have issues here) and i get the chills. IF you are in a pinch get it, if you have the time go get something better from a pharmacy"
4,wonderful book and record,"This is a wonderful read. An evocative novel about a string quartet and a sad love affair, which evokes the musical life as well as can be imagined and the nature of tragic love. The book leads one to want to hear the music(I went to the record store to purchase the pieces I did not have) and this record contains them all. A fine pair of complementary gifts."
5,none,"As soon as I read the book I had to dash out to buy the C.D. Loved the book and loved the music - just superb!Being a Mancunian who has lived in Australia for 21 years I would love to know what the author's connection with Manchester is? Can't seem to get on to his web site to direct this question. He obviously knows Manchester very well and mentions many places familiar to me including the Central Library, Bridgewater Hall, home of the Halle orchestra. No mention of Manchester in the Bibliography. If it's possible to forward this on I'd appreciate it.Many thanks"
1,bah,"This review covers episodes 2 to 4 which are very much alike.I was delighted with the first one: gone were the womanish, delicate characters so common in other yaoi, replaced by two strong, witty males involved in dangerous adventures.I do not know why but with her second episode the author, instead of pursuing this fun-filled path, gradually making her two men fall for each other, decided to take a very serious turn for the melodrama.Taki has a heart rending -and uninteresting- past that comes back to literally hunt him. Gone are the fun, the humour, the light hearted adventures, replaced by endless tears and guilt;we are back in the obnoxious routine of a genre made to please romance-loving straight women more than gay men.I guess I should just give it up..."
1,Lasted For Almost 2 YEARS!!!,"BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION!!!!Id advise to not buy from this company at all, since our daughters room was purchased exclusively though them, and 2 years later drawers are broken(Actually wood broke)and everything shows extreme signs of wear. To be completely honest were only in her room maybe 10 % of her life, so for this kind of wear and tear is just ridiculous. I guess that spending around 1500 dollars for furniture isn't adequate anymore.Thanks a lot DELTA.Wondering why nothing is made like it used to be?This is the perfect example, lets spend hundreds of hard earned dollars for something that will break as soon as the company is no longer liable for it.I ADVISE NOT TO PURCHASE!"
2,Disappointed,The three Venetian pieces were purchased for me off my registry. This piece however arrived with a cracked leg & because of the damaged leg the whole dresser wobbled. We were very disappointed. We have a replacement coming. Hopefully that one is in better condtion. The two other pieces; the crib & the baby chest arrived in perfect condition & look great in the baby's room!
1,Simmons customer service = TERRIBLE,"Do not buy a Simmons product. They have the worst customer service! We purchased a similar Simmons Unit in January. We noticed that a drawer was cracked. We were told that it would be no problem to get a replacement drawer. Today is April 20, 2003, we are STILL awaiting our drawer. They have not responded to phone calls or e-mails. What a disappointment. Don't let this happen to you."
5,INNOVATIVE--REAL GENIUS,Greyscale is a group to watch. Their music will soon make it's mark in the industry.
3,Full release grip,"I installed these grips on my full set of club. I used them for 3 weeks and decided to remove them after having problems holding on to the club.I was very persistent when trying these grips, I believed in these grips. I feel the problem for me was the bottom of the grip was to small and if I had built the bottom of the grip up with about 4 wraps of tape they may have worked out fine.If you are going to purchase these grips I would recommend you do 1 at a time building the bottom of the grip to fit the size of your hand."
3,I should have known better,Got this a few years ago. No major problems but the chipset does not have adequate cooling. I had to mount a fan directly to the heat sink to prevent crashes.
5,a classic of European literature,"Its a classic from a relatively unknown literature from part of the world that is still in our heartland. Extremely moving and beautiful stories about universal themes, with a poetic style of great writing. The translator does it justice."
2,Hard and noisy,"I concur that this wedge is extremely hard; it has no give like standard memory foam. Additionally, the zipper grasp on the cover is huge, and if you move the pillow in the night it makes a really loud clinking noise--I've already disturbed my husband several times and I've only had the pillow for two nights. I haven't tried an alternative, but I would recommend not starting with this wedge if you are shopping around."
3,Libbey Vina Round Wine Goblet 6 piece Set,The glasses are of right size for red wine. The only draw back is that they are heavier than I thought they would be!Good value for money
2,Too heavy for me,"I purchased this set because I liked the size and nice balloon shape of the glasses. Unfortunately, they were a bit heavy for my liking, so I ended up returning them."
3,have to be careful,These goblets are very big and heavy. You have to keep one in both hands. The rim is so poorly profiled that you have to be careful to not spill your drink or it makes you look like you were dribbling.
1,I should have listened .....,Many of the commenters on this product mentioned how big the glasses were -- I should have listened. I sent them back and found a more manageable size at a local store.
5,Wonderful Wine Glasses,This was by far the best deal on the web for these glasses. They arrived intact too. Their large size lets the wine breathe and gives a good presentation of all of it's attributes. I've recommended them to all of my friends. I bought two sets of these and two of the white wine goblets.
2,"broken, due to poor Manufacturer's boxing","I would normally have typed this review in the 'packaging' feedback, but since the 3 of 6 glasses came shattered, I realized the manufacturers box allowed for WAY too much room to move around. Even with a 'fragile' sticker, they were bound to break. Very disappointed.The OTHER 3 glasses, actually appear to be nice and big red wine glasses, I'm sure they will be fine after whiping the glass off of them from the other broken 3."
5,"Big, classy... Freakin awesome.","I've seen a lot of reviews that say these are BIG. Yes, they're big, but they're wonderful to pour into, pleasant to drink from and they just look cool. I would not say they're ""too big"". I like the size a lot. If you're curious about how much they'll hold, just measure some liquid out in a measuring cup and you'll see. They're 18oz, but of course you probably won't want to fill them to the brim with wine. These are your typical ""oversized"" wine glasses and they fit a nice, comfortable amount of drink in them.Really, only problem regarding the size is storage. I don't have a rack for wine glasses so these just go in a cabinet.. They take up a ton of room. I wouldn't knock them down a star for that though.I've put them through my dish washer many times and they come out happy and un-chipped. Seem very sturdy and they stand up nice and stable. Nice stems on them too for holding."
4,Good buy,"Inexpensive, attractive, easy to maintain-- they get the job done! No issues have arisen with these glasses. Definitely recommended."
3,Decent but not a ChaChaGlass,"These glasses are nice, but you can't beat the designs of ChaChaWare!This Holiday Season I recommend 100% American Made glassware at [...]"
5,Very good deal for quality wine glasses.,"Libbey Vina Round Wine Goblet, Set of 6These wine glasses are of a very good quality and if you are a red wine lover and enjoy entertaining, these are great glasses at a good price."
4,Nice.,"They are very nice. Nothing fancy, but a good wine glass for everyday use. They were for my wife and she picked them out."
3,Terrible quality,"If you're looking for nice wine goblets, these are not even close. However, they do hold liquid and are inexpensive.Major negative points:Stems have very noticeable mold flash (you can see it and WILL feel it).The bowl is wavy when looked through.The bowl has tactile lines from poor forming techniques.The rim is finished with a thick bead of glass.Very thick, heavy glass.Uneven."
3,Beautiful glasses.,The glasses were a smaller than I thought. my mistake. They made a wonderful gift. If you have larger wine glasses please let know.
2,flawed product,"Glasses looked great at first, I didn't inspect them but just took one out to see it but as I was washing them I saw one glass has what looks like a stone embedded in the side of it. Now my set of 6 is a set of 5."
5,"This book is powerful, instructive, and brilliant.","Ayers book should be read by all educators who work with young people forgotten by the system. His case studies are brilliantly drawn and teach us a great deal about ""juvenile justice"". It has provoked discussion of poverty, violence, and social change. It has changed the thinking of many of my students for its clarity, insight, and hope."
1,Vector Electrolysis Hair Removal,"This product took forever, at about 30 seconds per hair, you could spend the rest of your life doing this painful process. Then after using it about one month, it stopped working at all."
1,Does it work?,"I don't know. I've had this over a year and still couldn't tell you. It's very, very time consuming and difficult to do on your own."
5,Clear and Present Analysis,"This is one of the most comprehensive, thought provoking and to the point books on terrorism I have read up to now. The author writes in a clear and concise way on the moral questions relating to terrorism and secession. He does not stop at the obvious and dares to take - well-reasoned - positions which might not always be what everybody would like to hear."
2,Waste of money,I bought this book because the author teaches at San Diego State University and gives open book tests to increase sales of his book. The book lacks an interesting quality but it does define terrorism in a way that hasn't been looked at previously.
5,I hope there's more..,"While this is a bit expensive for an historic recording, it would be worth paying twice as much to hear Toscanini conducting an excellent orchestra with warm sound. Not as grating as his NBC performances, and because of this the final of #2, for example, sounds more driving and focused. With a little luck, we'll get a few more of these hidden gems to pop up."
1,"Horrible, just ask 3 of my friends!","It's really our fault. We already knew of one person that had this phone, and it was horrible. However, the price was very appealing, so we thought we'd try it out. Then, after we started having problems, we talked to a couple other people who had the same phones. They had the same exact trouble. The problem is, sometimes, it simply does not work at all. It is the worst phone I've ever owned."
1,This phone sucks!!,"Don't buy this phone! I bought it when it first came out (so it was quite expensive), hoping that it would be better than my other 900Mhz phone. This phone is nothing but static. Not-to-mention you can hear other peoples conversation even after you change the channels numerous times! Another annoying thing, is that after it hits 40 on the caller id; you only see the number when the phone rings, if you try to look for it at a later time it's not there! Like the call never existed. All-in-all, definitely not worth the money. Especially, not what I paid for it!"
1,Short-lived phone,"Brand new out of the box, phone had an unimpressive range of not more than 400 feet. The answering machine's electronic voice is slow and cumbersome. After just a few months of ownership this phone started to have serious sporadic problems. Several friends have left messages that the phone apparently never recorded. I'd really like to know how many important messages I've missed because of this phone. The speed dial does not always work correctly. Considering all of these problems, the phone is not usable. I'm very displeased with this phone and plan on returning it as soon as possible. Do not buy one."
3,pretty good,"I have had my phone for about a year and a half now. I like it. It has a lot of nice features, without being too pricy. The only problem that i have encountered is that i have had continuous problems with the battery on my phone. Since the the third month of ownership i have had issues with it. (the time/date voice is a little annoying too), but my main issue was the battery."
2,Disappointed in amount of children-sung songs,"After purchasing the Wee Sing Halloween and LOVING it...I was disappointed when I played the Christmas CD. My daughter was as well...there aren't very many songs where the children are singing. If my daughter wanted to hear adults sing Christmas songs, I could just turn on the radio. I highly recommend Halloween but I think that they could do better for Christmas."
2,Halloween Wee Sing much better,I bought this after having bought the Halloween wee sing and my kids loved it. This one is disappointing. A lot of the songs are sung by adults unlike the Halloween music which is fun and sung by children. Some of these Christmas songs are sung by children but overall I wasn't very impressed with this cd. Most of the songs are slow not fun songs. Not that I'm opposed to the songs but for a children's cd it's not very fun. My kids always wanted to listen to the Halloween cd on but they don't really care about listening to this one.
1,Extremely Dissappointed,"Having been long-time fans of the Wee Sing franchise, we expected nothing less than the high-quality, fun and energetic music that we'd previously experienced. The Wee Sing for Christmas, however, was extremely dissappointing. Not only are the fun and light-hearted songs few and far between, but most of the songs are sung by adults. Whatever this is, it's not an album for kids, and, in my opinion, not even for adults. It's just boring and mediocre. Do not waste your money by adding this to your collection of children's music. It's not worth it."
2,Wee Sing For Christmas,"Not as good as Wee Sing For Halloween. I expected more songs oriented toward young children. Fun & funny, rather than classic Christmas."
5,good choice,"songs are sung by kids, nice voice!very nice and clear song book, excellent!it is really worth to buy"
4,Short and fun,"The songs are short, but fun. I love the finger plays that are included. The only problem I have is that the book is hard to follow with the cd. I love all the songs and enjoy singing them with my 3 year old. She asks for this cd throughout the year."
4,"Nice, but short songs","I remember loving this collection when I was a kid. I don't recall the songs being shortened back then, but maybe I forgot.... Anyhow, the songs are great and there are a TON of them, but a lot of the songs have been shortened even though the songbook has all the words. My kids don't mind."
1,Wee Sing for Christmas,One star only because the song I wanted and that is supposed to be on this CD is NOT! Please inform whomever from the producers of this CD there is No Little Drummer Boy song there.
2,NOT for those interested in English Country House Decoration,"This book was surprisingly disappointing to me, a big fan of ""English Country House"" decorating, as illustrated in books by other Colefax and Fowler associates (Chester Jones, Roger Banks Pye). I bought the book on the strength of the author's Colefax and Fowler connection, only to find that the author is a designer at one of a number of subsidiaries of the corporate Colefax and Fowler Group, and apparently has never worked for the Colefax and Fowler design firm. As a result, her style is nothing at all like traditional Colefax and Fowler, with its period furniture, lush fabrics and liberal use of trimmings, antique accessories, paintings and engravings. If that is what you are looking for, don't buy this book. Instead, look for ""Colefax and Fowler"" by Chester Jones or ""Interior Inspirations"" by Roger Banks Pye."
3,No cables included,"There are no cables, thus you will likely need to order a SATA power adapter & SATA cable. I bought a HP 9040n 4 months ago, so I assumed everything would be available, but there were no cables included and my CPU unit did not have the right ones. Thus, now I am ordering $10 more worth of cables to be able to install it. Just a clarification on the other review - this is not a burner."
2,not very good,Asus dvd does not read disk no software who would sell a product with out it makes no sense.Will not download from asus site.
5,"Great watch, great value","My husband needed an upgrade from the sport watch he wore through grad school, and this was a great fit. At 5'8"" 175 lbs, many mens watches look big and awkward on his wrist. This one does not. At $60, it was a great value and is very good quality. His only negative comment was that he missed being able to check the date."
5,Best Watch Ever and the Cheapest Price Ever,"Saw this watch at a major department store for $110, checked Amazon $70, checked back again later that night AND IT DROPPED TO $61... uhh... can we say ""sold?""I love my new watch. The face is actually thinner than the band! super lightweight! Stylish for dress or casual!"
1,Broken when arrived,It wouldn't keep time. This is the second Skagen watch I've purchased for my husband and both have failed. It appears what was once a great product is becoming not so great. Beautiful watch just didn't work.
3,"Nice watch so far, hurts my wrist. (early review)","Let me start off by saying, I LOVE the look. It's a great looking watch. Not loud either.My issue with this watch is that the crown jabs my hand whenever I move my hand up. It's also a little difficult to put the strap on. The strap itself feels like it will tear or damage easily. The earlier reviews lead me to believe this is indeed a fragile strap/watch.For these reasons, I don't use it as my daily driver.Looks great, though!UPDATE:I tried using it a little more often, but it is a pain to wear. The strap started getting ugly too. I'd recommend staying away from this watch."
2,"Looks good, but too fragile!","I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loved it. It's great looking, not overwhelmingly large, with a slim profile and simple but classic.However, after having it only a short while, he dropped it facedown on a vinyl floor, and the crystal cracked. The cost to repair the watch is too high in relation to the original cost. I don't believe I'd purchase another Skagen watch."
2,Pretty...pretty fragile!,My roommate got one for himself and his girlfriend and I got one for my dad for Christmas. All three of them broke! I need some Orbitz gum for my dirty mouth after having to pay them $40 to fix their fragile watch. They are slim and nice to look at - if you can keep the crystal from cracking.
2,Didn't work,"Loved the look of this watch and it had favorable reviews. Came promptly after ordering it and thought what a handsome watch. Had it for a day and it stopped working. Then it would work off and on. Thinking it was the battery, I had the battery and seal replaced to no avail. Returned the watch and am still waiting for a refund."
5,Love this watch,"This watch is thin, elegant, and comfortable. Lightweight, you don't even know you are wearing it. This is my second identical watch."
4,Super Thin skagen Watch,"This is my second Skagen Watch, quality product and love the low profile. I wear long sleeve shirts and my huge watches always got caught on the sleeve and made me crazyyou'll love this product"
4,Ma montre Skagen,"Cette montre est très jolie, j'aime les momtres minces et Skagen fait du bon travail à ce chapitre. Ils pourraient avoir encore plus de modèle pour plaire à tous. Moi, j'ai choisi le modèle le plus ""décontracté-sport-nature"" que j'ai pu trouvé mais j'aurais aimé avoir encore plus de choix ou mme mieux, pouvoir dessiner moi mme un modèle qui aurait été encore plus lisible (les aiguilles plus larges...), jouer sur les matériaux...Daniel Dostie"
3,"nice watch, elegant, but costly in the long run","This is my favorite watch, by far. However, it has its issues, the most annoying one being the fact that the leather band is a proprietary format and it costs $25+shipping on Skagen's website (sometimes they offer free shipping). And the leather band lasts about a year. After 2 years I started buying generic 12mm leather bands and use a box cutter to shape it. They last about the same, and some even look the same, design-wise, but, oh well, it's not quite the same - there is the sharp cut edge that looks a little odd.Then, there's the well-documented instantly shattering crystal. I just heard a cracked glass noise and then I saw it was my watch. Without me hitting anything. Ouch. However, when I contacted Skagen, they didn't admit to anything, they just said ""please send it to us for repair"" so it cost me $6 (shipping) to fix it. 5 years later, the second crystal still holds. Not 100% scratch proof, but not shattered either."
5,Slim - fashion,"I am very satisfaction with my watch. This is a watch slim, Luxury, very fashion. I love it so much"
1,"Decent watch, proprietary band costs too much","I have a similar version of this watch, a 331 series. The problem with all Skagen leather banded watches is the proprietary strap. You have to go back to Skagen to get a replacement as none are sold on the open market. And you cannot order a strap from them, you must send your watch to them, shell out $32 and wait 4-6 weeks to get it back. If you add the cost of shipping+insurance to send it to them, you're out around $40 for what is a poorly made strap. What a 'bargain'I know this all to well, I just went through it a this month with my Skagen. Never again; when this strap goes so does the watch. Do yourself a favor and avoid their watches. The watch itself is nice and keeps excellent time, I just refuse to play their silly game."
4,Great fit and really slim,As advertised. Really enjoing it and have gotten more than a few compliments. Great look for the low price. No complaints.
5,Love it,Love it!!! The only problem I could forsee for some is it will not lay flat. Band is permanently curved.
5,Will,"Bought in Dusseldorf (Germany) airport shop during holiday in 2005. Fantastic watch, great looks but not gawdy, super thin and light weight. If you like heavy clunky watches this isn't for you. Battery lasted 6.5 years. Band started splitting last year and trying to find replacement band, since they are unusual, in how they attach to watch case."
4,A great dress watch,"It is an understated dress watch with a refined look of an expensive dress watch. My only complaint is the watch seems small on my arm and frame. I am 6 ft. tall 215 lbs. and the face of this watch would be better proportioned to a smaller man with smaller arms and wrist. The stitching on the leather band is a nice touch. This is my second Skagen, and the 1st is larger and I wear it most often."
4,Slim and attractive,"THis was a birthday gift for my fiance' who has not worn a watch for 15 years because they were all so heavy and large faced. This watch is super thin, light weight and very 'euro'stylish."
5,MY FAVORITE,"I JUST LOVE THE DESIGN FROM SKAGEN. HAVE USED THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL ALLWAYS KEEP BUYING. GOOD QUALITY, EXCELLENT DESIGN, AFFORDABLE PRICE"
5,Light weight and perfect for summer!,I bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it! It's perfect for being out on the golf course or wear it with a nice suit. It never catches on his sleeves and he sometimes forgets that he's even wearing a watch. I highly recommend it!
4,quality and value,"I ordered the recorder and book /cd for my daughter, who needed it for music class at school. (I think that sharing the community recorder is just gross! Even if it is ""sanitized"" after each use. Yuck!) The instrument is good quality and perfect for school music classes. Didn't sound nearly as bad as I thought it might :) The color choices make it fun, too!"
4,A tense read,"Two young women, friends from childhood, go back-packing to India - exotic at first, then increasingly sinister. Marvellously vivid descriptions and tense situations, though the emotions tend to be a little over-written and repetitive. But it is a real page-turner: one really wants to know what happens next."
3,"not memorable, but a time passer","Losing Gemma had great potential-i loved the whole idea of it, but it wasn't executed as well as it could have been. the beginning was great, the middle kind of fell apart, and then the ending was just...odd. the writing was good, but the plot, after reflection, wasn't spectacular. a good read, but not a favorite."
1,"Poorly written, predictable ending, derivative plot - skip it!","Losing Gemma starts out with a good premise - what happens if you go to India with your best friend, then come back without her? But that was where the suspense died. The pace of the book was off, the characters were cardboard cut-outs and Esther, the main character, was annoying and unbelievable. But the main thing I find truly surprising was how flat and dull Gardner made India seem. I also doubt very much if she's spent much (or any?) time there, as it read to me as though she had simply picked up a few colorful descriptions from a DVD on travelling in India.I would have loved to have given it a couple of stars at least, as the plot idea was original, but nothing about the book brought that originality to light. Pity."
3,"Started great, lost it halfway through","This had an excellent, gripping start. Others have pointed out how tense and absorbing the first half of the novel is. Unfortunately, it hits a lot of bumpy patches and never quite pulls itself together. Too many conincidences occur, and the story never resolves, just sort of disappears."
5,GRIPPING TRAVEL FICTION,"THIS IS AN EASY FLOWING WRITTEN BOOK , GREAT MIX OF TRAVEL AND FICTION WITH TWISTS THAT KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEATi READ THIS IN 2 DAYS , I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT LOSING GEMMA AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ABOUT THEM TRAVELLING MORE AROUND INDIA,BUT THIS BOOK WENT TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND DEALT WITH THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GEMMA AND ESTHER .. AN EXCELLENT TWIST TOWARDS THE END , SAD BUT UNDERSTANDABLE .. ENJOY !!"
2,Descriptive but lacking,"I'm still trying to figure out how this was translated from 12 languages. Yes, the scenes in this book were wonderfully descriptive but the story as a whole was, ""eh, so so"" at best. I would have liked to see more of Gemma's character before the end and then maybe I would have understood her need to do that. As far as I am concerned, there were a lot of story holes and complteley unbelievable incidents particularly surrounding the ""death."" I won't spoil it for anyone who wants to read it but YIKES!"
2,let down,"This story was a disappointment for me. Besides seeing the ending coming from a mile away--I mean, how many hints do we need??--the narrater has a tendency to say the same things a hundred different times. ""I felt so guilty about Gemma,"" or ""I was nervous about Gemma"", and that kind of thing get repeated and repeated till you almost find yourself skimming. Her reemphasizing her emotions at every moment was a serious case of telling, not showing. In short, this book was no ""The Beach"". But I will say that it had a good premise, and the author never pretends to have any writing style. She is very matter of fact in her story telling skills, with little pretension. Still, I think I could have used a lot more complexity and mystery in the way this story was told. Bottom line: potentially excellent plot, poorly executed."
5,EXCELLENT READ,"This is the most interesting, and gripping book I have read in a long time. I could not put the book down, and finished it in about 4 hours. I have recommended this book to nearly everyone I know and everyone enjoys it as well. Have a great time reading this interesting and powerful novel!!"
4,"It's ok. Probably should take a lesson or two first, though","This book is fairly inspirational, and includes a lot of good information. But it's not for the ultra-beginner. You should at least watch a video or take one lesson before you dive in here. For example, if you don't know what all of the individual slapping/tapping/muffling techniques SHOULD sound like, you won't be able to tell if you're doing anything correctly or not."
2,"Ok, but not a book for someone that already has rhythm.","I found this book to be pretty much pure rhythm exercises... if you already have rhythm, you don't need to buy it, just play the Congas.I will admit the teaching style is good (if the student does not already have rhythm!) but I always listen to the audio sample first, and I ended up skipping through the whole thing until about track 34... once you do that, yeah the rhythms are good but it's nothing you can't do with your own imagination.:("
1,Who was Polaroid?,"This is another product by a fly-by-night company without buyer support. Like one of the other reviewers I bought one in 2006 and it will not work with a computer running Microsoft XP. XP has been the standard for at least six (6) years. Like other companies Roid should have removed these unusable products from retailer's shelves. Both Budweiser and the grocery store remove expired products, why not this company? There are no updates that will work with the XP and it has 97% of the computer market. If I had bought this from Amazon I am sure that my money would be refunded without even having to return this nonworking artifact. I am sure that now that Windows Vista has been released none of Polaroid's current product will work with it or be supported with updated drivers for Vista."
4,Inverter,"This inverter works well for single low power applications like small tvs computers ect. ""Johan"""
5,Excellent resource,"This is a fine, detailed book explaining how to plan and build an indoor climbing wall. The book is organized and methodical in it's presentation and includes every aspect of the planning. Chapters include:1. Why and where to build a home gym2. Planning your climbing features and gym3. Budget and materials4. Framing and Building5. Insets, features and textures6. Crash pads and flooring7. Handholds and footholds8. Hold installations, routesetting, and wall maintenance9. Training10. Legal and insurance issuesThis book has a huge amount of ""no-nonsense"" information for one small volume. A good investment for anyone interested in building a climbing wall."
5,It's the best.,"I don't know who designed this ""monster"" but they must have had an anteater phobia. Anyway, ""Trumpy"" checking out the kid's pets, ""winged potatoes"", ""long eared potatoes,"", while the kitten is chewing on his snout,is priceless."
5,Joel is the best,This is one of the funniest mst3k ever. Joel is great and so funny. Never get tried of it.
3,"Cheesy, but really funny!","Mystery Science Theater 3000. What can one say? Well...I'll tell you. This Cheesy, but hilarious movie has probably the funniest moment in history. Of course not everyone has a love for cheesy movies, but for me. Well, this movie by far out does the others. After watching this movie you will know who trumpy is, and why Huzzah! is a more commonly known phrase among Mystery Science Theater 3000's fans. This is a must see for the real Mystery Theater 3000 fan."
3,Attention Mike Nelson fans!,"Being a huge fan of MST3K, but never having seen the episodes with Joel and 'bots (instead of Mike Nelson, although he was writer at the time), I ordered Pod People, Mitchell, and Cave Dwellers and found them to be sorely disappointing. These movies were cute and interesting from a historical viewpoint, but unfortunately not even close on the funny scale as any MST3K with Mike on a bad day. Amazon for some reason advertises these movies as starring ""Mike Nelson"" but be advised that this is not the case. Note as well that robot Crow, is much different than in the episodes starring Mike."
3,They really tried . . .,"I have to give them kudos for trying, because it's obvious that Joel, Crow, and Servo try their hardest with brilliant wit and sidesplittingly funny comments that should go down in MST3K history among the most quotable lines ever, but the fact is, they couldn't save this movie. No, not even the MST3K touch could make this movie watchable. Pod People is the worst movie ever, and not even the charm and wit of Best Brains could make it tolerable. I absolutely cannot watch it."
5,Just another outstanding MST3k,"In this episode Joel and the bots are forced to watch one movie that seems more like four, and of course none of them make any sense. But as usual they make the movie not only watchable but incredibly hilarious. My favorite line is ""Delicious kitty, looks like a potatoe."""
4,"(Man, that last scene was really goofy..)","Imagine being stuck in a room with padded walls in some strange European country for 48 hours with songs by Morrissey and the Cure playing nonstop. This movie will invoke similar emotions. The little kid's voiceover is extremely unnerving. Some people say Manos was the worst MST'ied movie, but I think this one is twice as awful."
3,It Stinks!,"If you like movies where the opening credits have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie, you're gonna love Pod People. It was tough deciding which I loved least--the evil red-headed step child or Greg Brady's rock band. I love all MST3K episodes...I just loved this one a little less. The episodes saving grace was Joel and the bots' performance of the Brady Band's ""Gearin up and Ready to Roll"". Or was it ""Giddyup I'm Ready to Go""? Or was it ""Idiots, I'm Ready to Grow""? Hard tellin, but whatever the title was, I had my zippo lit--waitin for the encore. Not my favorite episode, but definitely not the worst I've seen."
2,Bored from the beginning,"Didn't watch but 15 minutes of it before switching to another movie. Although a fan of Mystery Science Theater, this wasn't worth the time."
4,Good Toy,I have a picky cat and she actually likes this toy. The only thing I have to say is that those little toys hanging on them with them being on elastic when they fling from the cat letting them go watch out for them to hit you.
4,"Not sure what to expect, but loved this film.","This film tends to be grouped with ""giallo"" films. It's more of a thriller. It does not have all of the ingredients known for the gialli.I love this film. Twists here and there that actually were surprising. If you can find it, get it!!!!!!!!"
1,The killers are our guest,This movie is not worth the money. It is shot on a low budget and the acting is bad. It drags along and never builds up to anything that make you want to keep watching it. They must have had a short of actresses because they have a dude playing a woman. I give it one star because Is seems like it was shot in one day. The killers are our guest is not worth watching.
4,Easy install providing you don't use the CD!!,"I followed Jeremy Stiltz's review advice and it installed easily.I have a Netgear router and a Cannon 170 fax/printer on XPI accessed the router interface by typing the URL (IP) that is printed on it (the router case) into Firefox's http etc thingy at the top of the screen. I had previously powered up the print server and connected it to the printer. The IP of the print server came up on one of the menu items. Something like ""attached devices"" menu.I followed the rest of his instructions and it worked - even though my Printer/Fax was not listedIt is not possible to reserve a static IP on the Netgear router and the print server does not use DHCP. I don't know if this is going to cause a problem if the internet or router goes down. I suspect the Net gear will always assign the print server the same IP anyway.It works and I am happy that my wife can print from her computer without mine being on!"
1,Did't work for me,I bought this with the hope of making my Canon MP830 wireLess. Set up went fine until my printer had to recognize the server ...ng. I found out then it doesn't work with all canon printers........had to return.
1,Not worth the trouble,"I use a MacBook Pro running Lion. My hope was that this little box would eliminate the need to repeatedly connect my printer via USB, but I have had nothing but trouble with it. After doing some research, I've found many Mac users had trouble with it as well, and while some have posted possible solutions, I don't have time to mess around to get this thing to work. Very disappointed in this purchase. I should also note that the Mac setup is of no help whatsoever. You have to use Windows to even locate the IP address of this thing, and even then it's not recognized with a static IP. It worked for a day with DHCP but after the weekend now it cannot be detected. This is a waste of money if you use a Mac. Just buy a network printer."
1,IOGear worthless,I could not get it to work. customer support was never available. Trying to get a refund but they sent another!!
1,Biggest POS ever.,"I'm so surprised that others rate this item at a 5 star. I'm only rating it as a 1 star because I couldn't go lower. I have a Windows 7 Pro and a Windows SP Pro network setup. I need both PCs to talk to my printer. This print server was supposed to easily fit that bill, but no matter how hard I try I can't get the software installed. When I click on the Installation Wizard, nothing happens. I disabled my Norton Firewall... still nothing. I downloaded the driver from the IOGear website... nothing happens. On either machine! Tech Support is like talking to a 4 year old... they simply read from a script. Requests to escalate the call fell on deaf ears. Absolutely worthless!!!"
1,Potentially Useless for Mac Users,"I have three Macs and two printers connected to a LAN router. I added my Epson inkjet printer to the router using IOGEAR's print server.After several hours of frustration and a call to IOGEAR tech support, my Macs still cannot send data to the printer. The printer queue dialog box says that the print driver processed and sent print files and all is just dandy, but the printer never blinks its green eye.The very nice gentleman at tech support said that my router is not set for DHCP. He was of course unable to give me any hints on how to do that, if it is feasible at all.The IOGEAR Web site and manual are pathetically useless. Web searches yielded no helpful clues.I'm stuck. Maybe you will be too if you buy this for a Mac LAN.Fred"
5,"IOGEAR USB 2.0 Print Server, 1-Port GPSU21",Easy install! Worked with out any technical expertise. Installed using the disk. Would recommend. Our printer was not on the list. Okidata ML 420.
1,Did not work with all computers in the household,Print Servers are tricky and you need to make sure that (1) they work with your particular printer - and (2) they work well with Windows 7 - this print server works well with my printer - but only on Windows XP computers - - and since most machines are Windows 7 - that is a big minus -
1,A dead ringer,"It worked only briefly, inspite of the easy installation, and had to be returned for a refund. The endless time spent troubleshooting this contraption was an exercise in frustration. It is cheaply made and not worth the high cost, the trouble, and the disappointment."
1,Not worth it,"Easy to install, and good form factor, but I am constantly having to unplug it to reboot it, it hangs frequently either right at the end of a job, or before ever beginning."
4,works fine if you ignore the instruction manual,"I have a Brother HL-5240 running through this product on Win 7 64-bit. When installing, I had to select ""Yes, I want to change settings"" and then ignore the instruction manual to select DHCP instead of a static IP address. Then, once the print server was installed, I had to deselect ""Use Printer Offline"" from the printer settings menu in the control panel (i.e. Devices and Printers --> See what's printing --> Printer pulldown menu & deselect ""Use Printer Offline"". Totally nonintuitive, but once you do this, the product works great. As usual, the engineers knew what they were doing, but the marcom folks barely had command of the technical detail."
1,Does Not Work,Product did not work. Setup software could not find the print server. Did not work with either Windows XP of Windows 7. Do not buy this product.
1,Big mistake,This device REQUIRES DHCP. If you don't run DHCP you're out of luck. Most TCP/IP print servers allow you to connect to a default IP address and reconfigure to your network. Not this one. The setup software is completely dumb. If it does not see the device it doesn't report it so it leaves you hanging. This is a cheap toy for home networks and it may work on about half of them.
2,Returned Product My Money Was Not Returned,"IOGEAR USB 2.0 Print Server, 1-Port (GPSU21)Sent the Product Back But Daniel Chang Never Sent My Money Back"
1,OOPs,"I was looking for a Print Server to go with my Canon Pixma iP6000D. The IO Gear server does not work properly with the iP6000D. No feed back from the printer like ink status, probably paper status, etc. I will probably move this server to my HP LaserJet 1200."
1,Struggles with the basics,"I installed the product shortly after receiving it a few weeks ago. It is great when it works, but it really struggles with mid to large documents. After several tries, I'm going to have to return this one and try a competitor.Steve"
4,works well enough with a Canon Pixma photo printer,"The only problem is that Windows (Windows 7 64bit) usually believes that the printer timed out... at least until the picture prints. Considering that there are so few choices for small appliance network print servers, it's good enough.I didn't use any of the software they provided to set it up and had no real problems."
1,"Get Netgear PS121, it actually works.","I don't know what's wrong with this device. It is simply taking a signal over TCP/IP and translating it back into USB for use by the printer. Tech support took a bunch of info from me then said check the driver and compatibility list. This makes no sense, this is like saying check that your lightbulb is compatible with your extension cord. I have an HP P1006, straightforward laser printer. Not listed, unknown to IOGear. Didn't work. Makes no sense to me, a 20 year networking guy who has installed numerous devices on networks. However, I am a cheapskate, so bought this on price. Ended up getting the Netgear PS121 which worked right out of the box. At the same price. Stupid me."
1,Worthless,"Setup is easy. The documentation is minimal but straight forward. I ran through the setup process. When finished, the computer running XP never saw the printer online. I never was able to successfully print using it. Back in the box and it is outta here!"
1,Not Compatible,"Not compatible with Canon ImageClass D800 series printers (at least not the D860). First thing tech support did was direct me to the compatibility list buried deep on their website to show me that the D860 was not on the list. (Basically saying; ""You fool, you should have checked our list""). Then they proceeded to run me through a number of different tries to see if it would work anyway. This turned out to be a waste of time...they concluded finally that it was simply incompatible. It might work quite well with other printers but I would go to the website and research compatibility before purchasing."
3,"Great device, Horrible documentation","The IOGear USB 2.0 print server works great in my environment. I have a mixed environment with 2 linux machines, two windows machines and one Mac. The management of the print server is done via built in web server and it is really easy to set up but don't expect to be able to use the included media. Even with my firewalls off I was not able to use the included search tool to find the print server.Instead I wound up using the Iogear website to figure out how to add an IP port for my printer which pointed to the print server. This wound up working great.Printing via Linux was a snap. Printing through the Mac required loading some Gutenprint drivers that my mac did not seem to have.Again, excellent little device but plan to spend some time looking up online documentation as the one that ships with the product is useless.Your mileage may vary."
3,Had problems with HP P1006,We purchased this to solve sharing issues with a HP P1006 printer. I'd used aLinksys PSUS4 PrintServer for USB with 4 Port Switchin the past with some success and wanted to see if this less expensive option might also work. The web interface for the server is quite a bit clunkier than that of the linksys and it lacks the extra external ports meaning I had to dig out a spare 5-port switch to plug in next to the print server. Ultimately it did not work - probably more of a function of the drivers and/or printer than this server.
3,Good solution - lousy support,"Finally got this working, after a very frustrating and unhelpful chat session with their online support. I was getting the error ""The segment of the print server you select is different from your computer."" Turned out all I needed to do was temporarily disable the Windows OneCare firewall (just during the installation process). Hope this is helpful to someone who runs into the same issue.It's now working great - aside from the lousy support, this seems to be a good solution for what I needed (allow shared network access to a Dymo LabelWriter that's not dependent on any one computer being around)."
2,Almost only counts in Horseshoes and .. well you know.,"I read the reviews with the problems and the solutions. I've been messing with personal computers for over 30 years so I figured ""I can handle that.""It worked well on two computers but for some strange reason one of the Windows 7 computers would just not see the server. I used the IP address method and tried several ways to access it but they just wouldn't work. Very strange... So, its on the way back to Amazon. They are great!Solution to the ""problem"", replace the inexpensive USB printer with a new network attached printer from Amazon, of course."
1,No Instructions for Linux (Ubuntu) Users,"They advertise that the product can be used on a PC with the Linux operating system. However, they offer no software support nor does the user manual even mention how to get set up with Linux. They mention Mac and even IPP, but not one word of instruction for Linux, other than they support it. Ubuntu Linux is the new and upcoming OS of choice for many PC users. Any company that does not offer service support for Linux (Especially Ubuntu) obviously has not come to terms with modern computing."
3,Works ok,"Finally works ok with my HP Laserjet CP1215 after 3 hours of confusing installation. Make sure you disable ""bidirectional support"" in the sharing settings under the ports tab. If you don't, you'll have unintended multiple copies flying out of the printer and can easily burn through a ream of paper before you know it. I can't stress enough-- make sure to disable BiDirectional Support when using this print server."
1,Doesn't work,"Print server doesn't work. The print server does recognize the queue but cannot attach to the printer. Tech support hasn't a clue.They say the printer is not compatable, or maybe its the driver, or maybe its a bad print server. I did look at the list of printers, and the model prior and after mine is listed, so I figure, what the heck, it should work with mine.I would buy this thing only if your printer was absolutely listed. Its my opinion that if you are lucky enough to have a printer that it works with, its probably then OK, but other wise, it may not work."
2,"Product is ok, Support is nightmare!!!","I would have give all 5 stars if the customer support was ""technically"" supportive. The print server itself was working quite smoothly in a LAN. However, it was not available for internet printing. reason: the print server only recognize the router only, not the external ip address. When contacted ""technical"" support, I got to know that some dump guys are sitting in the iogear support and they do not actually know anything about the product technically. only they could tell me that everything is given in the instruction manual huh? if it is so why should I call the customer support? Then they started blaming my network/ remote network etc. Reality is that they do not know what they talking about!!!!Bottom line: If you are looking for a print server that is to be used only within your LAN, it is the best one for you for that price. Do it yourself, never expect ""technical"" support from IOGEAR."
1,no way to uninstall the software,"I purchased this product a few days ago. Today, I hooked up everything and it didn't work with my HP-5600. My fault --- I didn't read the details regarding it no working with multi-function printers. I am giving it 1 star because there are no instructions on uninstalling the software. I didn't feel like rummaging around in my XP to uninstall it by hand, so I just did a complete restore of my system from a backup i had made a few days ago.1 star for no uninstall."
1,Did not work,My printer would not work with this device. Their web site showing compatible devices was two years old so it was no help.
2,didn't work for me,"This did not work for me. Spent about an hour or two. gave up and bought a wireless printer --- difference in price wasn't that great, and saved me the time."
1,Disappointing,"Bought this because I was having no luck networking my Lexmark X6170 all-in-one with Vista to XP. The X6170 is listed in the compatiblity charts published on the iogear.com website. Had no trouble following the instructions in the set-up, but could not get the computer to communicate with either computer. Called iogear tech support (on hold for a long time). Tech said that multifunction would not work ... only printer function. OK. Had me manually reconfigure the tcp/ip ports and incurred several errors. Had to turn off the bidirectional to get the printer to print 1 test page that the printer paused after every 2 lines (even on draft mode). Could not print any more. The queues would not purge -- status would stay at 99% after each print. Had to reboot after every print job to clear the queue. Put it back in the box and shipped back to Amazon."
1,Nothing But Trouble,"I was able to install right out of the box...then after about 3 weeks I had to reinstall windows xp on my computers and the printer server no longer works. I already dumped the boxes so now I can't return it.I've spent hours trying to make the printer server work again, but no luck. Waiting to hear back from tech support. I found the list of supported printers online and I see that my brother HL-5040 is not on the list...of course, it did work for 3 weeks."
4,Works fine with MFC6800,"Purchased April 19, 2012Recognized my Brother MFC-6800. Has built-in web page for configuration via network (no software needed).Needs a bigger buffer and is a little slow but works fine. Coaxial DC jack is sensitive so sometimes the power disconnects if it is flexed a little bit. Connect it. Place it where it won't be bumped or tugged and it will be OK."
2,I guess it works for some,Will not work with my fairly old (8 years) hp all-in-one laserjet. No scanning through the server. No faxing through the server.
2,Inoperative with Mac Mountain Lion,"Due to a change in Apple printing protocol, this print server does not work with OS 10.8 (it's OK with 10.7). In fact, none that I have tried work in this environment, so it is more an Apple problem."
3,NOT WHAT I WAS WANTING,"I WAS MIS LEAD A BITI HAVE A PHONE LINE IN MY MOBILE HOME IN THE UTILITY ROOM ONLY AND THEREFORE THE DSL/WIFI MACHINE IS IN THAT LOCATION.THIS IS A WINTER HOME SO I NEED A PRINTER THAT HAS PRINT HEADS IN THE CARTRIDGES AND THEY ARE NOT WiFi CAPABLE, SO I WAS TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING I COULD PLUG INTO MY HP D4360 PRINTER THAT WOULD MAKE IT WIFI COMPATIBLE SO I DID NOT HAVE TO PUT MY PRINTER IN THE UTILITY ROOMSO I STILL DO NOT KNOW IF THEY MAKE SOMETHING I CAN PLUG INTO MY PRINTER TO RECEIVE A SIGNAL FROM THE COMPUTER TO PRINT"
3,"Works flawlessly now, but had initial set up problems","Needed a print server when the internal networking failed (no replaceable network card) on our HP 2605dn laser printer.Our set up is 1 iMac + 1 docked Powerbook + DSL modem/router/switch/Wifi etc.The BIG initial frustration with the IOGear print server was the need to enter its IP address into the ""Print & FAX"" area of the Mac system preferences.Nowhere does the documentation tell what the IP is, or how to get it.As a last resort, somewhat akin to kicking it, I hit the small reset button on the thing. Lo and behold! It had the printer spit out a page showing, among other things, its IP address.Plain sailing after that. All is forgiven. Has worked flawlessly ever since.BTW the IP (for mine at least) is 192.168.0.13.IOGEAR USB 2.0 Print Server, 1-Port GPSU21 (Silver)"
1,It does not work,"Not advertised is a limited compatibility issue. If your printer is not on their list, you are screwed. There are no patches or firmware updates. I contacted their tech support and was told this."
1,Old Printers,"This thing is complete junk unless you have a printer that is ten years old that isn't an all-in-one printer/copier/scanner. I tried an HP and Epson printer and each one would do the same thing. Print the document 3 times, then freeze before finishing at some point so then I would have to cancel the print job, unplug the printer, and restart the computers otherwise the print job would keep trying to print over and over again until the printer ran out of paper. It did the same thing on both printers."
5,Great Little Print Server,"I wanted an inexpensive print server to allow the four computers in my house to share a printer. The GPSU21 fits those requirements quite nicely. There was an initial problem with my network setup, but a quick call to IOGear's support easily resolved that problem."
1,"Appeared to install, but could not print","We tried to install this print server using two different printers on two different networks. The installation CD seemed to install on both systems, but we were never able to print to the attached printers.The box claims that this product will ""easily connect your printer to a network."" Well, it was easy to connect the cables, but that is as far as we got."
3,"Win7 install very easy, XP not so much","Physical installation couldn't be easier: just plug stuff in. The software wasn't too bad to get going, especially for my Windows 7 machines, but I had a heck of a time getting it to work on the XP machine. I don't have any Macs or Linux machine any longer, but it supports lpr, IPP, and Appletalk so there shouldn't be any problems with those.Given that this is almost $40 and a much better new network-enabled printer is just over twice that (check out the Canon Pixma MG5220) I don't really see the value in this thing. I ended up returning it and getting the new printer instead."
3,Be careful when you use multiple print server,"I have 2 printers served by 2 IOgear printer servers.There is no problem installing the 1st one. The problem happens when I install the 2nd one.If you use the default LPT1:, you will lose the 1st printer.I have to try (and error) several times to get both print servers intalled properly by using different LPTx:"
5,IOGear Printer Server,"Great printer server, easy to set up and works great with my printer. Had a hard time finding a server that would work with my Canon printer. Great price and very happy with it."
4,Excelente,"Excelente, se instala con facilidad aunque preferiblemente hay que asignarle un IP fijo; tiene un wizard que facilita la instalación. Se instala la impresora y ya!"
1,SUCKES BIG TIME !!!,"Ok.. If you have bought it... Too bad... But all is NOT lost... The web manual sure sucks.. BUT1) Install the product as suggested so that you get the web interface access first.2) Skip the ENTIRE Manual save the last part..3) The product ONLY works on IPP... So dont worry ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.. Set up IPP only and get working...4) Dump your old printer, return this device and go for a 100$ Brother Network Printer... It comes with a BUILT in server and prints perfectly and it doesnt NEED USB.. Although it does have it....Have fun Guys !"
1,This is a piece of JUNK,I bought this to network my laptops and desktop together on 1 printer. After 3 days of trying every configuration I could find it NEVER worked. It was difficult to set up and the installation instructions give no troubleshooting assistance. Don't buy this piece of crap!!
1,"Wanted to love it: bad design, worse support","In order to use this on my Mac, I need to know the IP address. The manual won't tell me what it is.Called the company, waited on hold for half an hour, finally was told the IP is dynamic and that with a Windows machine, their software will help find it, but for a Mac, need to use my router to find it.Oh! Your brand of router is new to us, we don't know what to do. Wait until Monday and maybe someone who is smart will call you back.Sigh.Buyer beware."
1,Incompatible with Vista and some HP laserJets,This print server DOES NOT work with HP LaserJet 1020. The seller did not bother to post a compatibility list online. Too bad.
2,IOGEAR,"Be careful of this device, make sure your printer is on the list of devices that can be used with it. other then that the setup was easy and if my Canon MFP c555 was on the list i would have kept it, but i had to send it back.Best of Luck"
5,Good print server for home,"Bought it, loved it, works great. I read the other reviews, and took their advice. It sets up quick,( 10 minutes) no problems. I will offer this advice. Keep it within sight only because if you have a power outage, it needs to be reset to let your network know it's there. This is not hard. (electric power supply): unplug it and plug it back in to the unit after 15 seconds and you are back to printing. It seems to have no delay, I have 3 computers using it (one wireless) and it is a champ. I will buy IO Gear again."
1,Info On IOGEAR Print Server Misleading,"The info on Amazon & on the IOGEAR Site was very misleading. I quote from their website:""IOGEAR's palm sized 1-port USB Print Server allows any networked computer to share an USB PRINTER.""It does NOT say that it doesn't work with multi-function printers.My wife bought me one for Christmas and upon hooking it up I found that my PC did not see it.I did some Googling and then discovered that it was not compatible with this type of printer.Very misleading Info on the part of the manufacturer."
2,not a good product,"i cant recommend this. it is large, clunky, and as far as i can tell does not do the charge/discharge cycle which it promised. i say this, because the display is unreliable, and if you switch the batteries to different slots, the same readings do not follow the same battery in the new slot. it also gets hotter than i like. i rarely use it, and only when i can watch it and feel how hot it is getting over several hours. i would not leave it plugged in overnight. it does seem to charge the batteries, according to a battery charge tester i have, but i don't trust this unit and don't like it."
1,super thin!!!,"I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic. It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded. Why didn't they use the padding on the changing ""pad"" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags."
4,I like the pattern,I really like the pattern on this changing pad. It matchs up my diaper bag; this is the only reason I bought it. I wish my diaper bag comes with this changing pad so that I don't have to spend extra money to buy it. Really I don't care about the pocket.
5,Supurb Video,"Have always enjoyed the movie... and the DVD is very good quality. Excellent perspective on the Shakespearean play ""Hamlet""."
4,"Great movie, bad recording..",Great movie. Classic.The recording is not so good. It was fairly bad and washed-out back in the '90s when I owned the VHS tape.
5,"Great movie, troubled download","I happen to love R and G are Dead. It is the story of how Rosencrantz and Guildenstern spend their time while offstage in the play Hamlet. They do some amazing things, like discover a ball falls faster than a feather and perpetual motion.I had a bit of trouble with my download and it took two days of googling to find a website that had a quick answer to my question. I tried to download this for an entire night and a morning, only to find later in the afternoon that the problem was my virus protection system. I had to turn it off for my download to start. I wish Amazon would post this more clearly in the troubleshooint section."
4,Hamlet revisited!,"Tim Roth and Gary Oldman gave a mesmerizing tour de force performance playing the role of two puckish characters, into a series of adventures in the royal castle around the figure of Hamlet.Perhaps an excess of artistic minimalism didn't let the film achieved a major conceptual dynamism.But its original and risky proposal is an invitation that well deserves our attention."
5,In Search of Rose and Guild,I too am trying to find a copy of this video. I've seen the movie and the play and it adds immeasurably to my enjoyment of Hamlet. Oldman and Roth are fantastic and the writing is excellent. Here's hoping the studio pulls it's head out of it's a** and rereleases this movie.
5,One of the best movies ever made - why can't I find it?,Where can I buy a copy of this video? Who can I contact to tell them what a stupid decision it was to take this excellent film out of circulation? Any info is appreciated - I'm at wpss@iglou.com. Thanks.
2,Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"A few funny parts, but not terribly exciting. You spend half the movie trying to figure out what's going on, which probably is the point."
3,Movie or play??,The movie was a necessary watch for a Brit Lit class otherwise I would not view it. It is helpful to be familiar with Hamlet since Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern were minor characters in that play. It would also be good to have read this play prior to the movie or you would be totally confused.
4,Wonderful wordplay from Tom Stoppard!,"Another movie that got mediocre reviews (including zero stars from Ebert!), but I liked it a lot. Then again, I had never seen it before except on film, whereas most of the reviewers were comparing it to the play."
5,My favourite movie of all time!,"There is no way you've come to this page by accident. Before the days of dvd, I used to rent this movie from the video place. Repeatedly.I don't know how many times I've seen this movie. It remains as fascinating, clever and witty as the first time I saw it. It is the same masterpiece it was when it was released the first time.But if you've come to this page by accident, this is the best movie ever made. Funniest, cleverest, most unpredictable, most intriguing. It is well acted, well written, totally immersive. Pure genius. If you're not convinced, rent it. You will want to see it again and again. Even more so than ""The Usual Suspects"".If you buy only one movie on DVD, this should be it. If ever a movie was worthy of five stars, this is it!"
4,Very Shakespeare,"A little Cerebral and a little slapstick, and all Shakespeare. It is how Shakespeare would have written the story of Hamlets friends."
5,LOL,"I love this movie! Its witty, and funny, and art-sy, too. It tells the story of Hamlet through the eyes of the bit parts of 2 of his friends. Being hamlet, it turns their witticisms into a dromedy. I reccomend this to everyone!"
3,Is it only two thirds of the play? Or closer to half?,"I am apparently in a minority of Stoppard fans who think he screwed up badly in adapting the play for film. Yes, stage plays are quite dfferent from movies and often have to be rethought for the screen, but I don't think that's an excuse for throwing out a very large percentage of the play to make time for dull silent wandering around and a few intellectual sight gags. If you've only seen the movie, you have _not_ seen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. I can only conclude from the reviews here, however, that if you don't know what you're missing, you may not miss it."
4,Vastly innovative work of dark comedy,"Stoppard adapts his brilliant play into a brilliant film with flying colors. The tricks he plays with sound and perception in the film are as intriguing as the actual dialogue, and Richard Dreyfuss delivers a breathtaking supporting performance as ""The Tragedian""; a performance I was so taken with that I had to take the roll myself when I directed a short version of this play locally."
5,"Excellent, I hope and pray that it becomes available again.","I saw this for the first time right after I finished a class in Renaissance drama at Cal State Hayward. It is full of inside jokes for any one who has studied drama or Shakespeare. Garry Oldman, Tim Roth, and Richard Dryfus perform with such energy and passion, that this surreal study of Hamlet takes on a wonderful life of its own.This is the story of two of the smallest characters in Shakespeare. Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are the two friends of Hamlet who are summoned by the king to find out what is wrong with the prince. This film tells the entire story of Hamlet from their point of view. With amazing writing, this story is full of surprises for even the most jaded fan of Shakespeare. I'll never forget the `conspiracy of cartographers' or the game they play on the tennis court. I hope this tape becomes available again, because I need to own it."
2,"Classic movie, but no subtitles and no captions","I love this movie. It is my girlfriend's single favorite movie of all time. I was excited to see it had come out on DVD and ordered it for her as a present. But I was shocked when we sat down to watch it and the closed captions wouldn't turn on.My girlfriend is hearing-impaired. We've watched hundreds of DVDs together. I've never found one that wasn't closed captioned. Many are both captioned and subtitled. But not R&G.; The shocking thing is that the VHS released in 1996 *is* captioned! I assuming we have ""Image Entertainment"" to thank for removing the captions?"
5,Gary Oldman is fabulous!,"Straying from his type cast role as an evil villain, Gary Oldman adds comedy with a sense of Shakspearian theatrical flair. A superb performance."
4,Discoveries for the young...,I enjoyed it but it's going to be gifted to a young relative of mine who has just made the discovery that (insert his gasp of stunned amazement here) Shakespeare is good.
5,"No matter how hard you try, you still end up dead.","Tom Stoppard sheds whole new light on Hamlet by viewing the play through the eyes of 2 of the lesser characters in the play.Rosencrantz and Guildenstern appear with little knowledge of their past because being a bit part, Shakespear didn't think there was much of a point in creating an elaborate past for them. Stoppard may carry this a little overboard by having it so no one including themselves are sure which one is which. I can't recall the guys name that plays Hamlet but he is excellent and would be worth seeing in the actuall play. I thought the movie was both hilarious and disturbing."
2,Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are better off dead!,"I had heard of this movie years ago from reading and hearing the reviews of various film critics. That should have told what I was getting into. This is an Art Film, not a regular movie.I found the movie to be only somewhat amusing and very confusing. This movie is based on a great idea: tell the background story of two minor characters from Hamlet. While it is filled with some great dialogue (most lifted from Hamlet) and a few great scenes (I particularly liked the one at the beginning with Richard Dreyfuss as the Player King and his troupe of slightly mad actors), it also overly complex and, for the most part, almost incomprehensible.The extra DVD with additional material and interviews of the cast and director interviews was even worse than the film. This is not really worth your time and energy. Comedies are supposed to be funny, or at least entertaining, and this was not."
2,not that bad,"In my opinion, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, was an okay film. There were slight alterations from the true Hamlet as well as from the play itself when the movie was created. In this movie, Hamlet's ""to be or not to be"" speech appears before the ""get the to a nunnary"" speach. I could not see any signifigance as to why those two scenes were altered. Another differance bewteen the two was the form of comedy. In the play, the humor comes from what the characters say. In the movie Stoppard descided to make the actions more funny than the words behind them. The casting was very good, and I enjoyed watching them act in this film. I would not recomend anyone buy this movie, however, if you have nothing better to do, it's not that bad."
1,Poor condition,What I saw of the movie was enjoyable but the DVD was scratched and in very poor condition.
2,canal + had this video programmed,"The fact that the coin kept on falling on his head everytime, said it al:This movie is timeless and NOT availableI saw this film for four aor five years ago on the filmchannel in Holland, now called Canal+,Please I want to sea the film again"
1,Profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film.,"Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of ""heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads,"" is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see."
1,Too difficult,"I am an educated person, but I have not read much Shakespeare and unless you have an English major this movie is NOT for you. The so-called ""genius"" of Tom Stoppard makes ""fun"" of things in old English that were not funny in the first place.Only recommended to English scholars or those who think they are really smart."
5,An exceptionally delightful film,"I've seen this film more times than I can count and it still delights me each and every time. Its wit and humor far surpass anything I've see on the screen. If and when we might be lucky enough to see it offered on DVD, I will be one of the first in line - and I will buy several - just to be sure I'll always have a copy.If you haven't seen it - watch it. But pay attention or you'll miss so much wonderful dialog."
4,Love Stoppard. Please re-release!,"I fell in love with this video a couple of years after seeing my first Tom Stoppard play. Given that he was what helped make Shakespeare In Love a great movie, SOMEBODY should see that his works are still popular and re-release this video. VHS is fine with me."
3,"Not as good as the first trilogy, but pretty good.","The books are getting very mealoncholy. Bernard still loves Gloria and his wife, but is torn between them. His wife is a wreck and he's practicaly being forced to take her back. Also Deighton confuses the reader because now Fiona's dead sister may be alive in a Stasi prison. Still even though the plots gone down hill the next novels worth checking out to see what happens to Bernard."
3,Spy Stories,"Len Deighton is the master when it comes to Trilogy spy stories. One cannot help but pull for Bernard Sampson (and Werner) as he enters a new adventure in the almost long forgottton ""Cold War"". If you have enjoyed Deighton's other works, you will no doubt enjoy this book and the others to follow."
3,Only for school...,"The only reason I got this book is because I am a student in ASL. If you do not have a teacher to explain things to you, or you already know ASL Grammar, this book is confusing! I do not recommend it. It is written in the 1980's and most of the signs in the book are outdated, and racist. You NEED a teacher to show you the right signs, explain what our doing, and make sure you dont use the racist signs.The pictures are hard to understand.In order to learn ASL well you need to take classes, because there is more to it then just memorizing signs: the grammar, the culture, the community, and so much more."
3,it ripped,i bought it for my new kindle fire it lasted a couple months but now the part where you put the flap in to close it is starting to rip
4,When you need at outside look at YOUR neighborhood,"Van Amerongen cartoons are sarcastic, original and amuzing, all adds to a refreshing point of view on life in this modern world. Sometimes the jokes are hard to get on first browse, but it's certainly worth a second glance."
5,A Cleaning Sound,"PLay this on loop while out of the house. Set-up speakers in your garden and play for your plants during the day (let them sleep at night, quitely!). Chant His name and feel your chakras clear up."
3,Not for me,"I was excited to receive this cd and took it to a friends house for a weekly meditation group. We ended up turning it off. The sounds on this cd seemed to be more about getting on our nerves than about peace and relaxation. The group didn't care for it. But it seems as though many do find it enjoyable and relaxing. So give it a try if you like, it just wasn't for me."
3,Very Nice,"I found this while I was shopping online and listened to a bit of it and decided right away I had to have it. Now that I have it I still like it, but it's a bit long and when I listen to it for a long time it does something really weird to my hearing,almost like I have tinnitus. So I only listen to it with out ear buds and for short periods of time. I think I would like it better without the tuning fork background. I have other pieces of music that have the same resonant sounds at the same decible levels that do not disturb my hearing. Try it you might really like it....."
4,"Joe Mooney ""forgotten genius""",I remember hearing Joe Mooney mant years ago and had forrgotten about him until I rediscovered his name when browsing CDs on Amazon.What a pity there are so few recordings of his prodigious talent available today.
3,The Croc is great....the rest .........humbug,"Here we have a pretty good monster story that eventually getsbogged down by too much character devellopment that we dont carefor, stupid script writting, stupid descisions done in the movie. Without giving too much info,,,here's a example...themonster gets killed...yippee, everybody turns around and leaves without checking closesly that yes....its dead.Anyway, im glad Roger Corman stills got his hands in movies, but he should stick to monsters and leave the dramas to others."
5,dinocroc,"This is a very good movie that I saw.It has gore,creature violence,terror,action.And the most important thing akinda happy ending.So do more goodreviews for this movie ok."
3,DinoCroc,"This is one of the better direct to TV movies the SciFi channel has created. It had reasonably decent acting, fair special effects and creature design, catchy music, and a good storyline. The conclusion is a bit underdeveloped, but overall this movie is quite watchable if you enjoy B science fiction movies. When I think something is a possible addition to my library it has to be better than facepalm, and I wasn't finding much to be critical of in this one. If you enjoyed this, be sure to catchLake Placid (Widescreen Edition).CA Luster"
4,Enjoying very much,"Great selection with one caveat... personally, I would have enjoyed having a few more vocal numbers intermingled. However, the music selected for this collection is nonetheless very good and something that I am sure to listen to for many years to come."
3,Just okay,"I bought two big band compilations: this one and ""Big Band Magic."" The second was far better in selection and quality. And, it had 48 cuts in only two CDs as opposed to 50 on three CDs."
2,Herky-jerky NZ new wave,"This 80s trio's most well-known for what's the strongest song on this nineteen-track compilation of their complete works, ""There Is No Depression in New Zealand."" This muscular, post-punk tune benefits from an assaultive base, a wry delivery of an ironic lyric, and a steady propulsion. The rest of the tracks, however, show a steady slog through unvarying takes on XTC's tribal rhythms, Magazine's claustrophobic ennui, and the Talking Heads' lighter global-light tunes with nods to reggaeish and funky beats. None of this has worn particularly well.The album seems to never end, and the similar sludgy pace of most of the songs weighs down whatever clever insights the lyrics might contain. The band is accomplished at what they do, and the vocal and bass-playing abilities sound confident, but there's nothing that makes this band stand out from any other group elsewhere in the early 80s, unfortunately. For completists of NZ rock only, alas."
5,I Can't Believe It!,"I give this book a 5, but after i read it I got so excited for the 4th one. I checked here, and saw the giant price mark for it, and just got ticked off. Now I'll never be able to read it unless I search high and low for it... which I was hoping I wouldn't have to. It's a 5 dollar book... and just for one copy of the 4th one is just a big hole in my allowance."
1,This Jump Drive Sucks!,"This drive is horrible! It barely fits into the USB drive. I liked it for a bit, but now it is a hassle. Also, it is not the size it says online. It is about 4 inches by 2 inches by 1 inch. it is horrible. don't get it. I would suggest the Lexar Media 512 Jump Drive Elite."
4,An excellent introduction for foreigners.,"I recently spent Thanksgiving week in Taiwan, visiting relatives, and brought my American fiance along. We both enjoyed this book because of its humor and usefulness.I liked the fact that it pointed out certain things/practices/habits that are exclusive to the Taiwanese culture. For example, it talked about the traditional ""wet market"" (a.k.a. farmer's market). So, my fiance asked if we could go to one, which turned out to be very fun. It basically gave me some ideas of places to show him for tourist spots.This book helped him to be better prepared for adapting the Taiwanese style of living for a week. As for me, it helped me appreciate my own roots more. I truly recommend this book. The usual sight seeing tour guides are dispensable. This one is just the opposite."
4,Good introduction to Taiwan; can be read through quickly,"I've been reading a handful of books around Taiwan and China; relating to their history, business, traveling there, etc.This was a nice, concise, easy to read (especially skim) account of things. While it's not always on the mark 100%, I think it errs on the side of caution which I appreciate. A nice read."
2,Disapointing,"I was disapointed by this edition of the Culture Shock series. Taiwan, as exotic a place as you can imagine, must be full of specific cultural behaviors. And the entire book only said to be alert and aware of them. There were no specifics. For those of us who are looking for specific do's and don'ts when traveling, this book was largely useless."
4,Taiwan Culture Shock,"This book provides an excellent introduction to the different culture in Taiwan. Since our son will soon be marrying a lady from Taiwan, we thought we should learn a little more about her cultural background."
2,not what I was looking for..,"I didn't like this book, we are planning to go to Taiwan to pick up or adopted daughter and I was hoping to learn about the culture to pass on to her. This did not have much about the family rituals and traditions and had alot of business info instead."
2,Glen Campbell Bad Times,"Not a good period for music in general. A lot coke snorting during the late seventies and early eighties made for uninspired performances and this is not an exception. Virtually no highlights to speak of throughout this show from Dublin. The recording isn't especially good either. Strange because just three years later I saw Glen do a show in Caesar's at Lake Tahoe that was a ripsnorter, seemingly minus the coke. Of this Dublin show, it was not particularly well sung, the songs were played too fast and there was none, I repeat none, of Glen's usual flashy guitar work. Also, the disc didn't play on my regular machine and I had to play it on my DVD recorder. Not recommended."
3,Quality made holster.,I bought this for an XDM .40 cal with a 4.5 inch barrel and 16+1 capacity a large gun by most standards. The holster itself is well made using quality leather and good stitching. I can only speak for the XDM but if your planning on concealing under a button up or polo this isn't the best choice. It does work well under a jacket or outside the waistband without a cover garment. It takes a bit longer to place on and off of your belt than other belt holster due to the design. If you want a holster for open carry or the range or concealability isn't your prime concern than this holster will serve your purpose.
4,Service as great but expensive shipping fee,My daughter loves webkinz and especially dogs. I bought two webkinz from this vendor and service is great. My only complaint is the outrageous shipping fee - it cost as much as the two webkinz. Vendor did indicate to me that other vendors increase the price to make up the lower shipping cost. It is true for some vendors but it is not true for all vendors as I checked around. I would like to see shipping charge to be reduced.
2,Cd not exactly what I thought,I purchased this audio CD for a person who has a CD player but not a dvd player. The CD only plays on a dvd device and not on a cd player.
3,"Toto classic ""Africa"" gets sampled in a JoJo pop hit","With such a brilliant 80s classic backing it up, this song should have catapulted to major radio airplay and chart success, but somehow, the melody and downtempo rhythm track doesn't live up to the quality of the song from which it borrows. While the 7 minute WaWa club mix sounds promising when it begins, the thumping electro/filter house beat is all it really has going for it. The Toto sample is mostly dropped until a small break in the center of the song, and JoJo's vocals are pretty much just sampled and washed out in the mix. There's just no real hook to be found. Bummer."
5,Fantastic!,"A fast-paced look at the events that occured in Charleston, at Ft. Sumter and around the nation leading up to the Civil War (or the war of Northern Aggression as we call it in the South : )A great study of the stalemate that made up the days preceding the conflict and an indepth look at Robert Anderson, the officer in charge of the Federal forces at Ft. Sumter."
4,Good worms-eye view,"A nice very detailed history of the few critical months at the beginning of the War Between the States (as we say in Georgia). Contains interesting details of life in the US Army and in Charleston not found elsewhere to the degree that you feel you are actually there. The author shifts easily back and forth to Washington DC for higher-level decisions. Interesting character sketches of Major Anderson and others involved in these perilous times. I would have given this five stars but for the author's weird tangents (McDonalds likes to fly the American flag? ""It takes two to tango, but only one to do the twist""? etc.). He has been hanging around academia too long and occasionally slips in these bizarre little asides. Second only to Winik's April 1865 (describing the other end of the war) in this year's crop of War Between the States books. Buy it and ignore the groan-inducing little cutesies."
5,Looks like a GREAT game!,The Monkey Island Trilogy games are the Greatest Games I have Ever played on my Pc! Monkey Island is a legendary part of Advenure gaming..And now they have it in full-color high-quality 3d!!This game is A MUST BUY!
5,EMI - Is this a last try for the dying genre ?,"Well, I don't think so. Escape from Monkey Island can make it alive again. It is the the title of fourth Monkey Island Game where updated Grim Fandango engine with elements of Obi-Wan engine is used to create interface and settings (It means that we won't use mouse anymore). There are over 60 auditioned voices. Some of them we have already heard (like Dominic Armato's). Some of them are used on ""old"" characters from MI1 and MI2.The humor is outstanding and music one of the best ever heard on computer. So, what are we waiting! Let's sail to the Carribean !!!"
3,"Good game, crashes too often","I enjoyed ""The Curse of Monkey Island"", so I was anxious to try Escape. The interface is not as easy to use as the last game, and traveling from one site to another takes more time than it should. I believe there are fewer puzzles than in curse. Also this game does crash often, so save early and save often. Fun, but the 3D is a waste as it causes the crashes and adds nothing. Just not as much fun as curse."
1,Would be awful nice if I could play it,"I have been a fan of the Monkey Island series for the longest time, and I sincerely love all their games. But the latest is a big disappointment. B/c it requires a 3D card, I can't play it--it's awfully hard to install a 3D card on a laptop. I was really looking forward to playing the latest installment of Guybrush's adventures, and I'm crushed that I'm not able to. I fear that Lucasarts is going to alienate a large portion of their audience."
2,i hated it :(,"australian devoleper,hostile take overs, giant robots, resturants, banks and tellers, it feels like a bad episode of something, and this part is at no way connected to any MI series in my mind,becuse MI is all about pirates and high seas adventures, not to mention the controls wich is really bad since they took the mouse off, better luck next time lucas..."
1,Dont bother with this one,We spend 2 days trying to make this game run on our system. Now it will but its very slow and full of bugs. The fact the game comes with a troubleshooting guide that is about 100 pages long should all tell us something. At Lucasarts website there is already an update you have to download in order to make some of the parts of the game work ( they call it minor problems..LOL). The controls are sheer horrible and the 3D characters look and move terrible. I agree with many others that they have been rushing this one to get it out in time for christmas. All in all a huge dissapointment. After all I am a huge MI fan and my heart skipped a beat when I saw they were coming out with another one. But now I wished they had not. Really save your bucks on this one and lets hope Lucasarts learned something from this.
