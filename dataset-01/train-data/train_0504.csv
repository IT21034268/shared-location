3,Where's the Rohan theme?,"Just like the first two, this is a gorgeous score and I love everything on it. I have one big quibble, though, which is that the CD is heavy on the tear-jerking sad tunes and very light on the herioc music. The track entitled ""Ride of Rohirrim"" has none of the stirring battle charge music from the incredible scene in the film, but rather is a short montage of sad melodies with only hints of the Rohan theme, my favorite from the trilogy. Much of the uplifting music from the film is missing; buy this CD only if you're willing to sink into the dark side of the films and miss the heroics. That said, it is beautiful music and worth having."
5,The good and the bad,"As everyone else has stated, this is a wonderful score, I highly recommend it.However, i'm VERY disappointed because the music from the RoTK trailer is NOT on the soundtrack. I think the trailer music is one of the greatest scores Shore has ever composed. I REALLY hope that the RoTK trailer music is on the enhanced soundtrack, as it is said that it will contain many soundtrack ""rarities""."
5,.....Outstanding,"I have enjoyed Shore's music with FOTR and TTT. ROTK pretty much keeps to expectations and stands on its own. I could almost smell the action as I heard the music - Shelob's Lair really has an Ungoliant feel and had me on edge, The White Tree is regal on a grand scale, and Cirith Ungol dark! Like a master magician Shore has weaved another brilliant tapestry deftly using themes from the grand scheme of LOTR to keep this album vibrant and smooth. Lennox, though good, just does not provide the climactic finale as did May It Be, or Gollum's Song."
5,Nothing short of spectacular,"While I truly love the music from all the Lord of the Rings films, this is the only one that I listened to before the film and was actually riveted, just by the music. The other ones meant more to me mostly after I had seen the films, but with the Return of the King, I was captivating and enthralled from the start. Boasting Billy Boyd's truly ethereal delivery of a passionate and haunting song, Aragorn's piece (with melody written by Viggo Mortensen himself!), awesome themes for The Pellenor Fields, Twilight and Shadow and The Grey Havens, and Annie Lennox's Oscar-bound ""Into the West,"" this soundtrack is a winner from start to finish."
3,Not the best of the trilogy.,I'll be brief and say that I consider the ROTK soundtrack to be the weakest when heard on its own. Overall the music is better suited and appreciated when accompaning the film. I don't consider it to be as outstanding or memorable as The Fellowship of the Ring or Two Towers soundtrack.
4,Trailer song,"Just to answer a question about the song in the ""Return of the King"" trailer... that song is actually taken off of the ""Requiem for a Dream"" soundtrack- you can find the song there, though I can't remember the name of it."
5,Great score!,"This is the first LOTR soundtrack I've listened to from start to finish, so I can't compare it to the other 2. This is also the first score I've heard from this composer, so I'm not comparing him to other works either. What I am comparing this score to is all the other scores to ""saga films"" that I have listened to many times. (The Star Wars, Harry Potter, Narnia, Back to the Future and Indiana Jones films.) All in all, I thought it was a great listen, from start to finish with only a few slow spots. I'm definitely going to eventually get the other 2, but I figured I'd start with the film with the most action since I particularly enjoy scores to action sequences. I'm not going to go into details of certain tracks and what-not, but I can tell you that if you enjoy music from epic sci-fi or fantasy films, this score does not disappoint."
3,Decent Book - FAKE PHOTOS,"It troubles me to no end that books that are to be taken as scholarly would stoop to using FAKE photographs....in this case none other than the famously fake tornado on the cover....to sell the books. I wish I knew if a) the author, being well-versed in the topic he has written about, KNOWS the photo is fake and is trying to hype his product or; b) he is ignorant of such? I am not sure which is worse? Until consumers cite their disgust with such ploys we are doomed to not knowing what is real and what is FAKE even in so-called non-fiction or ""scientific"" text. The publisher should be ashamed."
3,Did the job,"I used these to decorate for a party. I thought they would be larger. Not so. They are small. But they did the job. Cute, but small."
2,Look bigger in the picture,Two stars because what I received wasn't what I saw on the first picture. It really was my fault for not researching it more.I felt disappointed but I had to use them since returning them would probably be expensive too. They look nice but like I said not what I expected. If you want apple sized lanterns these are it.
3,paper chinese lanterns,took some effort to get the paper lanterns to stay on the mini lights and get them hungonce in place they stayed on the lightssame issues bringing them down but nice for the price
3,difficult to assemble,Assembling these laterns was quite difficult. They rip easily. I don't think i will be buying any more products like this.
5,Love it!,Delivery was super fast! And it came with one extra lantern as an example with a spare light bulb! I'm really happy with this purchase.
5,What a gift...,"I bought this for a friend who had been checking a similar set that was hanging above our dinner table at a restaurant a few months ago.Not only was delivery prompt, but the item itself is exactly as described.I assembled the lights, yes, some assembly required. There is a spare lantern cover, in case one of the other ones break. I thought this was a GREAT idea... especially since these are authentic paper lanterns and can rip easily. BE GENTLE while assembling. Do not force anything, and don't stick any metal pieces through the paper cover. (I did by accident, but it was a tiny tear...)Worth it! Especially as a gift for a friend obsessed with cute items like this."
3,Misleading colors,"As mentioned in the review right before mine: the colors of these lanterns are not as pictured. Unfortunantly, that review was not posted before I ordered these. I was especially looking forward to the soft purple and green lanterns. These are actually very bright yellow, red, blue, and lime green. Good deal for what it is, but not what I expected (or wanted)."
1,"Poor quality, impossible to assemble","I was completely disappointed with these lanterns. First of all, who knew they would arrive unassembled? They were so difficult to put together, and they came with absolutely no assembly instructions. The paper in the lanterns is so thin that when you try to insert the wires that convert from flat to round structures they all tear. It was a mess. In addition, after I finally got one of two lantern sets assembled (which took two weekends)and hung them up outside (with many torn and disfigured lanterns), the light string went out after two days! The return policy was only for two weeks from date of purchace (and it took over a week for them to be delivered), and the ordeal required to ship them back to the vendor was outrageous. Needless to say, I had to keep these defective, unusable light strings. I would never recommend this vendor nor order anything from them again!Disgusted."
3,little paper lanterns,"These are very difficult to assemble. It felt like an anger management test, really frustrating. After I got the 4th one assembled, it seemed to go a little easier, I thought, until I poked a hole right through the little lantern. You have to put the metal hangers inside, and it's as if they just won't fit. They are small, about a 3 1/2"" diameter. You just have to ""wrestle"" with the hangers, 'til finally, they go in place.I must admit, they were really cute, once they were all done, but I dont' want to try that again. I completely destroyed one lantern, and tore 2 others through the process. I think the assembly is something you have to practice and get good at, and I don't think the manufacturer should expect people to figure it out, as you can't help but tear a couple in the learning process. No instructions for the assembly, just for the light replacement. They will work for what I bought them for, but I would not buy them again unless they were already assembled."
3,Thought they were bigger. They are pretty small.,We had some bigger ones of these that we bought at Bog Lots. The lights ran on batteries and the batteries died after about an hour of use. So we bought these and were expecting them to be about the same size as the others. These are smaller than a softball to give you an idea of the size. Otherwise we are very pleased with them.
1,Not a worth its money,Just to let everyone know its 4 in wide super tiny the picture shows big paper lanterns cord to short to let it hang them in air u need an extention cord to hang them on ur ceiling they are a super rip off dont buy them
3,Takes Me Back,"After listening to the Juke Box website I wanted instumental music from the 60s. I found this and it isn't exactly the selection I wanted but it works. Takes me back to the 60s, pretty cool."
2,Disappiontment,"The book is very general! There are not very many specifics about any of the reels. In fact,I personally own several reels from manufactors of reels listed in the book that are not even listed. I was very disappionted. If I would have been able to review this book in a book store,I would have not purchised it!"
3,What do they want,"As a new novelist, my journey to find an agent who will accept my work is a new challenge for me. I found this book quite helpful. What I did do is purchase a couple of books and chose different areas from each book to build my cover letters, my queries and my synopsis. I honestly don't believe one book can meet all of those needs.Joe Smiga"
3,Authors Didn't Update The Book,"Give `Em What They Want was published in 2005. There is no mention of Amazon Kindle. That came after 2005. All the information on who publishes your book is outdated because of that. But somehow the book seems even more outdated. The drawings look very retro and show men in suits and ladies in dresses with hats. The clothes look like the late 1940's or the 1950's. They couldn't be later than the early 1960's. The text mentions typing and SASE's, including a mention of licking stamps. This couldn't have been written later than the late 1970's, especially when it mentions that self-adhesive stamps were new at the time. I'm right! I just googled the question. The post office first introduced self-adhesive Christmas stamps in 1974! Case closed. The authors could have done a better job of updating the material."
5,The American Statehouse: Interpreting Democray's Temples.,"My 56 year Annapolis residency has led me to an in-depth love affair with not only the ""oldest state house in continuous use"" but also the one in which the dome's architect, in 1785, was the first to incorporated the ""double dome"" principle, as used by Christopher Wren in London's St. Paul's cathedral to symbolize The Creator's cosmic power, in order to symbolize the ""earthly power"" of the State, when the ""separation of Church and State"" was a major issue put to rest in our democratic form of government."
5,Bought it as a gift,"Bought it for another person (clinicist who works with genetic disorders). He had already the 4-th edition, but was looking to buy the 2010 one. Claims it helps him a big deal during his practice, as well as likes the price."
1,Thing has to be smakced to be quiet..,"Ok...it works pretty good, tranfers air into the PS3..and fits on the PS3 just fine..after about 2 weeks this cooler started humming really loud, I started getting pissed off at it..so I hit it, and it stayed quiet...about another week, i had to hit it twice to make it shut up...im at about 5-6 hits now....I just wonder how many more hits before it just breaks..."
1,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this product. It does not even properly fit the PS3, it hangs off the front and does nothing to cool the back of the playstation where it is needed. The product was grossly misrepresented on Amazon's site and I was unsatisfied."
1,God help me,"The worst part about this book? How about the depressing fact that the time I wasted reading it is gone forever? Pity this man's family, and pity any poor soul who wastes his/her money on this worthless drivel (I, fortunately, borrowed a copy from someone else, which is the only thing sparing me the financial insult to my injury of time). Stay away, at all costs."
1,Can't Believe This,"I read this book ages ago - I can't believe the back and forth reviews. Did you notice that D. Hunter is the one responding about how great this book is!You can see his writing style ...congratulations Dave Genesvese,Shawna601 and Sean Rourke all alias names for Darren Hunter!I read it to see what the guy says next, but perhaps no one should extremiate this guy's lack of soulful inflections and insanities. He needs to grow up."
1,Horrible,"It was recommended that I read this book, and what shallow reading from a shallow person.Not only do I agree with the other review, he does come across too conceited and while he boasts of his significant other(who must put up with alot of these behaviors, he makes fools of both of them.He needs to learn that you get what you give especially if you work or your involved! (lack of work in this case - and lack of fidelity)If you want to read a good book, or a funny book, this is not the one."
4,this is the work of pure genious,"i also bought this album for ""butter of 69"" but not because i mistakenly took this for only cibo matto's work as the reviewer above does... because i heard the talent of all sorts of my favorites when i heard that song. the moment i heard the ""butter of 69"" song in my friend megan's car i recognized the bubbly vocals of the girls of cibo matto and then i realized who else was on this album... sean lennon, mike mills, a member of jon spencer's blues explosion... it is quite wonderful. the pumping guitars, the raw and bubbly vocals combine into a frightful yet beautiful masterpiece."
3,decent disc not close to viva la woman,I really bought this cd for butter of 69. That's pretty much all i got. I like a few of the songs such as 9mm but I wouldn't get this cd just because you like viva la woman. This is a much harder sound and it doesn't have as many vocals.It has a lot of guitar and it is not very smooth. I am definetly glad to finally have butter of 69 because it's my favorite song.
5,CLASSIC STUFF,THIS CD BLEW ME AWAY. MONO LISA IS A THEME OF MY SPIRIT. GET THE CD AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. 18.00 IS AN AWSOME PRICE BUT NOT MORE
3,pretty shoe,this shoe is fun and pretty. fits a little snug. i could have ordered a 1/2 size bigger. looks really nice on tanned skin.
4,This is Great,"Have used this picnic bag, And it holds the cold in well. Love all the extras as well, have used them all.Will buy this for a gift for others."
4,"Great, roomy pack","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents and they love it! Very good quality, and the perfect size for 2 people."
4,Bargain-priced home theater receiver,"I purchased two of these units and am using one of them in my current system. For the price, the sound and operation is very good. The remote codes programmed easily into my DSS receiver remote control, making for a very easy system to use."
3,"Great videos, but DVD does not ""Play All""","I have the same problem as the reviewer from San Antonio -- the DVD does not ""Play All"". Perhaps it is a bad pressing, since we are in the same state. I also returned mine for a replacement, and still had the same problem. After one video plays, you must return to the main menu, select the album, select the video, select your video options, and select your audio options to see another video. Once that video ends, repeat the process. It's a pain."
4,Misleading but Great,"Sorry, my last review sucked. I hadn't even bought the cd yet. Now I have. Well, for one thing Amazon's track list is WRONG. The actual track list is:1.Under The Bridge2.Give It Away3.Californication4.Scar Tissue5.Soul To Squeeze6.Otherside7.Suck My Kiss8.By The Way9.Parallel Universe10.Breaking The Girl11.My Friends12.Higher Ground13.Universally Speaking14.Road Trippin'15.Fortune Faded16.Save The PopulationYeah, so if you have already ordered it your in for a big surprise, because unless mine was a defect (Which I'm positive it's not) the tracklist is completely different.At first I was dissapointed that Aeroplane, The Zephyr Song, and Can't Stop werent on here, but then I realised it is still a great cd! I mean have you ever heard a bad Chili Peppers song? The DVD is great as well. It DOES feature videos for Aeroplane, The Zephyr Song, and Can't Stop. This collection is well worth your money.Peace out."
4,CHILIS STILL RULE!!,"GREAT! EXELLENT! the CD is pretty awsome it definitly has the greatest hits. The DVD is also amazing, although i was hoping for some other videos like breaking the girl, or my friends (old version) or some other old videos, but still this is a great stuff for collectors!!!MUST BUY IT!"
3,Audio quality leaves a little to be desired...,"I think the compilation is great and the DVD is wonderful to have but I think the sound quality on the CD is lacking. I don't know if it's my stereo but I tried it on our main system, our mini-bookshelf system, and in my car and the quality was pretty much the same....very average and very flat. There was no punch to any of the music. I heard one of the songs playing on the radio and it sounded great so I have to wonder if it's the CD. Other than that, although that's kind of major, it's a pretty good collection."
3,Red Hot??? Luke Warm More Like It,"It's Nice To Get the Red Hot Chili Peppers music videos on DVD, BUT... My Friends? Nope. Breaking The Girl? Nope. Warped? Nope. What's up with the incomplete collection? Should be titled ""some of our greatest hits."" It's amazing to me that after two music video DVDs by the Peppers we still don't have those videos. :("
3,"Great videos, but DVD will not ""Play All""","(...)-- the DVD will not ""Play All"". Perhaps it is a bad pressing, since we are in the same state. I also returned mine for a replacement, and had the same problem again. For each video you want to play, you must go back to the main menu, select the album, select the video, select your video option, and select your audio option before the video plays. It's a pain."
3,Weird,"Let me start this by saying that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are my favorite band of all time. I have loved all of their 8 previous disks, so naturally I would love this CD right? Not really, while the songs themselves are awesome, I would have to say that this CD is a little strange. The order of the songs is what makes it strange. Hearing ""Californication"" played right after ""Give it Away"" is strange. This CD would be better if the songs were in chronological order so you could see the bands progression. I also think that the single ""Love Rollercoaster"" should have been on here. The new tracks are really awesome and leave me ready and waiting for the next chili peppers album next summer."
2,I am immortal and I can not die,"Filmed in the 70's this is a latecomer to the sixties formula big brother paranoia films.An experiment is performed to see if ""truth"" can be told with the hope that the results can correct all the ills of mankind and pollution to boot. The subjects are carefully chosen based on the objective.Unknown to our guinea pigs and testing staff, the experiment was usurped by the military for nefarious purposes; anyone objecting is dispatched.Naturally the computers and guinea's are not suited for the plan. This is a brain teaser as everyone has to confess they lied. More insidious is the fact that the computer can not understand that the subject does not believe he can die and sets out to prove this. This becomes a compressing problem.How will it end? Or will it end? What would you do in the situation?"
3,Mind Warp,"I got this under the name ""Mind Warp,"" and decided to get it only because it looked like it could be okay. (Well, why else would we rent it?) The story is pretty basic. Two doctors stick four people in an underground lab and start doing mental tests on them with these brain-machine computers. (Spare the constant ""beep-beep...beep-beep"" from any TV show.)Nothing really happens. The film's first twenty minutes is about an escapee from the lab who has a file showing all that goes on. Apparently, these tests are pretty much illegal. He eventually gets caught and killed off. Then the four people (a war veteran, a priest, a girl, and some other guy) are tested on. It's all really boring until finally they all start going mad and either killing themselves, or each other, until the abrupt and pretty unsatisfying ending.Really. It isn't very good at all. I found it in the horror section, and hopefully if you do, too, you will just see it. But it has nothing to offer."
3,Ok...,"I think this is the pistol I have, anyway, this gun is a good gun for starters. It's pretty acurate, but its also pretty heavy. The magazine that with mine was pretty hard to load without a speed loader, so if you want this I really do suggest getting a speed loader."
5,"I'm wondering if she's still ""SINGLE""?","Kim Coles and her adventures in dating had a lot of highlights and actually had me wondering if these guys existed. From the time that she sneaked to see a guy, to her high-school mishaps and college meltdowns, from her marriage and divorce to dating Mr. Right and Mr. Right Now, Kim is very frank about her experiences and is not trying to scare people, but get them to look past the rose-colored glasses people tend to look thru in order to see what they want to see. As for the men, she left behind some pearls of wisdom that would help us to locate and relate to the woman of our dreams, instead of just feeding on the fantasy. Sure, she's not an expert on the subject of dating, but she had enough to say to put it on paper, and she said it very well. Funny and thought provoking, a fine piece of work."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"I loved this book! It reminds us that being single is not a disease we should avoid at all costs! But sometimes it should be cherished, and that the behavior is normal afterall."
4,Too Funny,"I have enjoyed this book. It is full of fun loving material. As usually Kim find humor in things that are not normally taken ""humorously"" If you want a good laugh on your way to work or from school, get this book a de-stresser."
1,Don't do it! It's just not worth it!,"I've been trying to force myself to get through this book, then I thought WHY AM I TORTURING MYSELF? If the author can't do a better job of writing than this, she really ought to stick to acting. The book is just full of cliches and silly, simple stories of how and who not to date. It's certainly nothing novel: don't date a man who doesn't brush his teeth, one who doesn't bathe, one who gives a stray dog to his mother as a birthday present, etc.DULL, DULL, DULL. I was thinking of donating my hardback copy of the book to some library--but, I just don't want to put anyone else through the pain!"
3,Hmm...,"This book had it's funny moments, but it was not nearly as funny as I had hoped. A lot of these jokes/senarios, we have all heard before. A worthwhile read if you really like Kim Coles in general. Not so worthwhile if your looking for a really hilarious book with fresh new humor."
3,Doesn't fit well,"We have the summer infant changing pad and this cover doesn't fit it well so the sides are showing. It seems to be of pretty cheap quality. However, I do like the navy and the terry cloth is soft. I would not buy it again."
1,Introduction to the Old Testiment,This would be a very good bible study except for the fact that it is tied to a video that was more than we could afford.
2,For those who like golf simple and aren't troubled by imprecision,"If this book had been even ten percent as good as people claim, there never would have been a golf instruction industry at all. I have had it in my own library since 1956, and every few years I pick it up again and try to figure out what the fuss is all about. If you must buy this book I urge you to consider one tiny revision. Instead of whacking with your right hand at the last second, get your hands ahead of the clubhead as far as possible (like he says), hold the angle of your hands which got them into that position, and get your right knee in before your clubhead hits the ball, which it will do a whole lot better without your right hand's voluntary help."
2,"Ok, but not that great.","Armour's book contains some decent basic tips, but he often comes across as a pretentious snob who is speaking down to the great unwashed masses of golfers. That takes away a lot from any enjoyment of the book. There are better books out there."
5,Best Book On Golf...,Probably one of the best instructional books on Golf every written. I highly recommend this book for anybody interested in learning more about the game of golf or improving there game.
1,Snowflakes on the sea,Was a very good read enjoyed every minute of it Love all her books excellent writer can't wait to read more
3,The Day of The Triffids,"The novel has an excellent opening. The hero appears to be the only one left who can see, in a world gone blind... then the strange plants begin their attack on humanity. There are some very imaginative and thoughtful elements featuring throughout the book and Wyndham makes the seemingly absurd plot convincing. In summary, the book is extremely readable and has a satisfying 'feel-good' ending. It does however become somewhat dissapointingly nostalgic."
3,Worth a revisit.,"An important book from the 1950's, one that I remember affecting me strongly as a teenager. Well worth a read now although a bit stuffy by modern standards."
4,Very good,"Over a week passed since I got a message that the books had been sent. I emailed an inquiry, but got no answer. After I received the books, I realized they came from overseas. If I had known this I would have been more patient. This information should be made more clear.The books were in excellent condition and made good gifts."
4,Have you seen the movie?,"Well, this is the book that started it. I really enjoyed this book. Naturally it goes further into the reason as to why the ""Triffids"" started in the first place. However, I must say that the movie starring Howard Keel (""Showboat"") was excellent as well."
4,Not a pleasant way to die.,"It is interesting to read stories that were written 40 to 50 years ago. This one starts fast and doesn't let you go until the end.Just the prospect of almost every one going blind gives me the chill. To be attacked by murderous carnivorous plants is an horror added on terror. This is a story that could be remade in a movie. It could be much better than ""28 days"".Wyndham is very good at describing the different ways that people would react to such an holocaust. The principal character's quest to find his new love is very well integrated with the story.You can almost see the thousands of triffids waiting at the gates for you to come out. Read this book please and if you know a movie producer, give him your book."
5,Something new under the sun,"This novel is remarkable for introducing several ideas, and for setting new benchmarks for other speculative novels. Wyndham doesn't bog himself down in the technical details of the end of society, instead he focuses on the human effects. Perhaps more telling, he allows his characters to muddle about and take their time learning how to live in a decimated world., thus enabling the reader to constantly consider ""What would I do?"" An apocalyptic novel unlike any other"
5,As a child this book set my imagination on fire,"I discovered ""Day of Triffids"" when I was around 11 years old... too many years ago for me to mention. It was the first John Wyndham book I read and probably my favorite. It's a close call but another Wyndham book, ""Chrysalids"", is another close contender for that title.I wont waffle on about the story line in Triffids its covered comprehensibly by other reviews. Suffice to say the book is classic sci-fi, mixed with light scary horror and oodles of imagination. It sets the readers mind alight with terrific ""what if"" concepts.Highly recommended."
1,"Terrible edition, ignore the publisher","I'm giving one star not for the book itself (which is great) but for its really horrible edition. As others have mentioned, it's crawling with typos and mistakes as if there was absolutely no proofreading. Skip this edition, better buy a paperback."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Somehow, an astronomical event has caused the overwhelming majority of the population to become blind.If that wasn't bad enough, mobile, dangerous plans called Triffidsare able to take advantage of the disdavantage. Without sight humansare extremely vulnerable to these predators.The narrator avoided blindness, by being in a hospital with bandaged eyes.From there, we have an examination of this disaster scenario, and what would happen."
3,Killer weeds,"Before there was Doom, or Aliens, or Night of the Living Dead, there was the Day of the Triffids. Written at the beginning of the Cold War, this sci-fi drama explores the fate of a human society where the masses are blinded (literally) and being stalked by predatory plants. The latter were created by the Russians (of course) thru genetic experiments. When comets pass by Earth and blind the majority of the human race, the triffids get loose and start feeding on humans.The book is a quick read; easy to follow and quite exciting. I first read it years ago and still remember it. The book is worth reading on two levels. First, it is quite entertaining. Second, it is a good attempt at describing what happens to human society when chaos reigns supreme."
4,Worth a read,"Well worth reading much better than the old film. I heard about his books on the First Tuesday book show, never read at school as so many people seem to have."
3,The best apocalyptic novel I've read,I purchased this as a Kindle special and was quite happy that the purchase turned out to be worthwhile. This novel is a good apocalyptic novel with strong characters.
4,Old school sci-fi,"In order to read this book and enjoy it, you have to put yourself back in the time period in which it was written. This is a 'classic' sci-fi novel. Its dated.First of all, you have over reaching elements of early space exploration (Sputnik), the cold war, and limited communication. If you think about the plot and the meteor shower that opens this story and the subsequent blindness worldwide, its sort of stretching plausibility. But if you go with it and read on, your in for a historical treat.Im sure your aware, The Triffids are these carnivorous plants that humans originally planted for the oils they produced. Only when everyone went blind, the plants were able to break out and hunt down the humans. They could think collectively.This is sort of like a zombie novel before Romero and Night of the Living Dead. This is also written as a memoir... from the point of view of a survivor. Its well done and holds up well."
4,Favorite movie source,I have recently decided to see how many of the movies that I have always loved were based on books. This is the book that got me started. I have shared it with others and we love the comments on society that are very true for today!
2,"Kindle Version is Terrible, Story is Great","The errors found in the kindle version are not by the original author. Rather, the spelling and grammatical errors are from whatever program transcribed the paper text into electronic form. Many of the errors will be a word like ""naive"" that is incorrectly spelt ""hal-e"" or something like that, where the program was approximating the figures.I do recommend reading the book itself and hope the mistakes in this kindle version do not deter others from enjoying it."
3,Was probably more original in its day,"This is a good story of so-called apocalyptic sci-fi. The beginning of the story hugely lacks in credibility, and the triffids are a really way too obvious examples of technology developed by mankind without always weighing the possible negative effects (nuclear holocaust was THE big theme, back then).But the post-apocalypse part is among the better ones written.Also, and this is welcome, Wyndham CAN write, I mean he can write in proper English, with more than a basic vocabulary, which turns the book into literature, wheras, very unfortunately, most sci-fi today is so poorly written, than even when it contains great ideas it just is not literature."
4,Dangerous plants,Interesting read. Old SF novel that talks about the fears of the time (apocalypse from space). Story is told well but I felt the reaction of the blind people was a little unrealistic in that they were more non-functionally depressed than they were hysterical. The triffids were interesting creatures that were never really explained to my satisfaction.
2,Dated tract,"I understand the role this book has played in apocalyptic writings and has heavily influenced many writers and directors who have drawn on its themes, but... still couldn't get into it or much care for it. I found the book to be very dated in its cultural relevance and more or less a tract on the authors ideas about how to create a society in his own image, which bears some resemblance to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young's thoughts on the subject (which Wyndham touches on). Lots of internal and external dialog and exposition without resolution. It's written as a first-person of course, but I found the approach frankly tiresome. Kind of like reading Ayn Rand - you want to jump over big chunks just to avoid amateur philosophy. I suppose I'm happy to have read it since it is somewhat a touchstone of this oeuvre, but there are better options out there (The Road, A Canticle for Lebovitz, even The Stand) if you are looking for musings on the end of our current civilization."
2,"unremarkable prose, poorly executed plot","Glaring grammatical and editing errors detract from a hastily constructed plot built on a series of flimsy contrivances. The author explores an end of the world motif, mankinds degradations and obligatory redemptions against a backdrop of killer plants and blindness. Disappointing at best."
3,"Dated, but still worth a read","The Day of the Triffids shows its age, particularly in its treatment of the female characters, but is still worth reading because it informed so much of today's science fiction writing. On the whole the characters are long-winded by today's standards and spend more time discussing philosophy and literaure than people in a similar situation would likely do. The triffids themselves are a brilliant bit of imagination by the author. Check it out."
4,Still fun after 40 years,"Day of the Triffids is many things. Most are well covered in other reviews. I fist saw the movie 45 or so years ago, and read the book about 40 years ago. It is a fun book to read. That may be somewhat odd to say about a post apocalyptic novel, but the book, while dealing with a serious subject, is not depressing and has enough mystery about the how things will turn out to keep you avidly reading.I think we have generally forgotten the tension that existed in the 1950's - even though it was not all that long ago. Day of the Triffids is definitely a product of the early Cold War and helps remind us how real the possibility of large scale destruction was."
3,"For a 1950's PA book, not bad at all","I really enjoyed this short novel, its ""english"" take on the end of the world , especially having been written in the 50's, is refreshing, i hope youll give it a go..."
2,proofreaders wanted... apply within.,"Fantastic book, just needs a real publisher with proofreaders on staff.Check this out...""The Tynsham people had the means to fetch supplies was in London. A couple of loads would not make a great deal from towns where there was no sign of the disease that of difference to them either way, so in the end we went as we had come.""Yikes.No author's work, let alone a great one, should be treated this way.Do it right, or not at all."
1,Not the book - the lack of proof reading,"Great story, spoilt by what must be no proof reading of the OCR-ed print edition. Disappointing and will make me avoid the Rossetta Books Into Film editions in the future."
4,Old sci-fi at its best...,"I love old sci-fi movies -- especially those made in the late 50s and 60s. This book was reminiscent of those old movies. It had the same character build-up, the sense of despair, and horror at what was happening, which was countered with the determination of the individuals to survive no matter what the odds.The book started off well, and continued on in the same vein, giving enough information along the way to paint the picture of what life might be like if nature turned on us and another form of life took over.The story is told through the eyes of Bill Masen, one of the lucky ones who survived the first events and retained his eye sight. Through his eyes we see mankind turning on each other, we desolation, and we experience fear. Fortunately, we also see hope and the will to live through a story well told. I recommend this book."
5,Great Golden Book,Another great book for my Granddaughter. She has a small collection of Golden Books and this one was an Easter present.
5,Just as wonderful as I remember it!,"I was thrilled to see this book is back in print. I remember loving it as a child, and I love to read it with my kids (ages 4 and 2). I also bought it for my 18 month old niece for Christmas and it brought back memories for my sister. The story is a heartwarming tale of a rabbit family imagining what their baby will grow up to be. The illustrations are fabulous and I recommend it to anyone with a small child."
2,DOES NOT HAVE TRITIUM!!!!!!,IT DOES NOT HAVE TRITIUM !!!! It will glow but you must charge it with a flashlight and will only glow bright for a little bit. Everything else is really nice about it! Very lightweight! My only gripe is the misrepresentation of the marketing of this product. I'm keeping it but I really would have preferred one with Tritium.
3,Quality speaker wire that is not for novice installers,"The speaker wire appears to be good quality. You can definitely spackle or paint over them because it is so thin. My issues with this cable are 1) the included instructions aren't very clear @ all, 2) terminating this cable with regular speaker terminals is not possible. A special kit from Cables Unlimited is required for each end and @ the time after my purchase no pictures were provided for them on their website.Amazon did deliver the item quickly and it was packaged well."
2,Speaker Wire Okay...Packaging was horrible!,"I had purchased the Ultra Flat Speaker Wire to add 2 more speakers to make up a 7.1 system...the wire was just fine however, upon receiving the wire I found that the plastic packaging for the wire was opened with cuts through the plastic and the parts were all over in the shipment box...it seems that it was opened before...not happy with this sale!"
1,PLAYED OUT,"I don't get how people act like this is a new style.I guess they havn't heard Ministry ""land of rape and honey"" or ""The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste"" or anything from Big Black (thats why steve albinis famous) or SPK ""opus die"" or the revolting cocks live album. or Godflesh's first few albums.Digital Hardcore is marketing an old played out style under a new name. I saw them live and I was so impressed I walked out in the middle. I sold this CD because it really really sucked.Get those ministry CDs and then tell me if i'm full of sh*t. or if alec empire is a supreme biter."
3,Stop the riot!,"I have mixed feelings about this CD. Songs like 'Speed', 'Atari Teenage Riot' and 'Into The Death' are brilliant techno/punk. Other tracks descend into raging noise. They are angry, they have strong political beliefs, they need to make the music a little more accessable if they want the message to be heard. Overall it just gives me a headache to listen to the whole CD."
1,what a w.a.s.t.e.,"sure i got this album. this is what it sounds like: AIIIIIIIIEFHHHHHHHHTRDGHHHHHOUESAA this is awful. pure crap. how can anyone take them seriously? they have absolutely nothing to say, their lyrics are laughably bad, their sound is played out. if you're looking for a loud sound, try some jungle instead. or stick with some post rock (salaryman, trans am). if you want a pissed off, INTELLIGENT sound, get the manics 'the holy bible' don't bother with this"
4,got gabber-punk,"First of all, this cd IS way better than 60 second wipeout.I first heard ATR on a tape my cousin lent me. After listening to the first 10 seconds I was like ""dude, this is so breakbeat"". Then ""start the riot"" shot off fast..... It was fast, loud, aggressive, and it wasnt all punk or metal. The beats were hard and the screaming was screeching, I loved it. I was like ""dude!"" I wanted to hear more stuff like it, which is kinda how I got hooked on gabber/hardcore. After that my life consisted of only school, work and gabber. Now all I listen to are dudes like Omar Santana, Delta 9, Ron D. Core, DJ Tron, Rob Gee, ATR, and anything else on Industrial Strength records."
3,Mixed,"I love the speed and the power, but some of the tracks are almost too (hmmm) bloop/bleepy for me. If ATR keeps with tunes more like ""Destroy 2000 years of culture"" and ""Start the Riot"", these pissed-off computer geeks will keep me coming back for more."
5,Pasta Bellisimo!,"My husband makes all of his pasta with this flour. Whether its lasagna, mezzaluna, fettucine - it's always perfect and gets rave reviews."
2,Misleading,"This seller was very misleading I was under the impression I was getting the students edition version of ""An Introduction to Literature"" but I got an ""Examination version"" which come to find out is the copy that instructors use and is NOT to be re-sold (clearly says so on the spine). While I was slightly upset by this, it turns out it has the same material as the normal book and was in good condition."
1,Misleading,"I ordered the 13th edition and received the 5th edition. The order was clearly placed for the 13th edition; it had the caption, picture and everything, when I ordered. Then When I received the wrong book I e-mailed back to see what happened and they replied that I didn't see their small caption at the bottom that read 5th edition. This captioned was not available when I purchased the book."
2,Helpful for my Lit class. Book VERY POORLY MADE!!!,"This book was very useful for my Introduction to Literature class. (Naturally) Contains works from many of the great authors.I am VERY,VERY disapointed in the overall quality of the book. DON'T BUY THE PAPER BACK EDITION. Get it in hard back if you can. With my copy of this book, as well as, the copies that belonged to several other members of my Lit. class, the binding broke and the book fell apart. Now I can't resell it."
3,Dense and Difficult,"This is the hardest Balthasar book I've read -- which is saying something! I didn't do myself any favors by reading this over the course of many months. Still this is the densest of Balthasar's works I've read -- I haven't dipped into his famous Trilogy yet. I found his exegetical discussion of the Resurrection to be a bit disturbing. It seemed to give too much credence to the potential of embellishments and shading by the Gospel writers. The other complaint I have about this edition is that it uses endnotes rather than footnotes. Perhaps this is because Balthasar is prodigious with his notes, but I hated having to flip to the back of the sections to read the notes and by the final part, I simply read them after I'd finished the body of the section."
1,not very good,"The sound quality of this CD is poor, the tone is flat. These are good musicians, but if you want sharp horns and snappy banjos, you'll be disappointed. I recomend looking into ""The Firehouse Five Plus Two"", they are great, and the recordings sound terriffic, espescially given their age."
3,Strong,"Its a strong cologne. Not fully masculine. If you like a fresh, aqua smell then forget this. It is long lasting but I din't really like the after linger smell. If you like Hugo Boss colognes, then you may like this. If you like the silent gentle smell, then its not this. I was looking for silent gentle but strong, I thought a unisex cologne may do it, but its a bit too strong here."
5,What a book!,"This is one of the best books about chess problems I have come across. An even better book by the same author is The Enjoyment of Chess Problems, maybe the best chess book ever written. I enthusiastically recommend that you get a copy. I got my copy through the Amazon used books and I am very satisfied."
4,"They do the job, but not perfect","Not very experienced with the filters, but this was my first try.Pros:Do the job wellVisual indicator is hard to beatConsDont last very long. They run out within 1 hour of continuous use with my PC compressor and spray paint using HVLP gunYou have to take out the orange ""stopcorks"" before using them. I didnt know till i got no pressure...then had a hard time getting one out...no instructions to remove them of course didnt helpWater sometime drips on the work surface...should probably have a better mechanism but dont know what other alternatives are out there...i guess i will experiment and learn"
5,Brilliant,The Eye of the Storm is one of the best films. A stellar cast that deserves accolades. I'm quite stunned that it did not receive an Oscar nod for best picture. A must see...add it to your collection.
1,Long- tedious-dull and somewhat creepy family drama,"I liked the cast, so I thought I'd give it a try. Too long- too talky- no dramatic movement- led by cast of weirdo personalities. Don't bother...zzzzzzzzzzzzz."
5,"it means encore, the Disco King told me","Bis is fun, smart if not intellectual, & very danceable. Having met them on both their visits to Australia I have found them to be nice w/ no rock star pretentions. I don't listen to them all the time but when I do, i don't regret it. This is a diverse & amusing album & you can see that a lot of effort & enthusiasm went into making it. Monstarr for instance is a good anthem for those who don't care what others think of their image etc...."
5,A good tune with revolutionary lyrics,"I first heard them on MTV's twelve angry viewers, (one of my favorite shows because you can see some lesser known bands) and I immediatly fell in love with the smart, and lively beat to ""Tell It To The Kids"" I bought the album the following day, and was shocked to find every song, good as, if not better than, tell it to the kids. Fans of the popular rock star Beck will get a kick out of them. I highly recomend it."
2,Not as pleased as I expected,This book is not exactly what I was expecting. It is more of a book for grandparents to enjoy personally. It would make a great gift to give to first time grandparents or any grandparent for that matter.
2,Not what I expected,"From reading others reviews I thought this would be a perfect gift for our parents. When I read it I thought the poem through out was kind of goofy. I thought it would be a book ABOUT grandparents that would be cute to read to the grandkids. It was more for grandparents and I didn't think it would keep my kids entertained & I couldn't see our parents sitting down to read and re-read this book. I'm sure it's perfect for some, but it wasn't what I had expected...the book was returned."
5,A gift any grandparent would love!,This book is a wonderful story about the joys of becoming a grandparent. It's an especially nice gift for brand new grandparents.
4,Great Book for New and Old Grandparents alike!,I purchased this book for my in-laws who are going to be new grandparents this august! I taped a picture of my pregnancy test in the back of the book. It was a great way to surprise them and it's something they can enjoy reading to their future grandkids!
3,Not for the casual listener,"This album is very different from anything I had ever heard before, and if I had heard it first, I would probably never have bought any Buffalo Daughter CDs. I would recommend starting with the album ""I"" before jumping into this one. If you liked ""I"", you may like this one as well. If you buy this and give it a chance, I would recommend some trendy chemical amusment aids to assist with digenting the material."
3,A Mixed Bad,Blunt Object captures The Bad Plus in all their glory and disgrace. There are funny and strange versions of Blondie's Heart of Glass and Queen's We Are The Champions but nothing invites the listener into the private joke.This is the absolute worst version of My Funny Valentine I've ever heard.[DW]
3,good for some!!!,"This book has some interesting projects and i like how it is organize. WHat i don't get are some of the projects it has, i mean it is suppose to be about modern furniture and i really don't care about wheels and some oold fashion pieces."
5,nice product,"i bought this product often. it is great toner for any kinds of skill and of course for any seasons. feel gentle, moist. smell great."
4,"Squeamish readers, beware!","I won't repeat the plot as ""Goblyn Queen"" has done a fantastic job. I would just like to add that this is the goriest, grisliest book I've ever read, bar none. Despite that it is science-fiction and much of the plot is hinged on technology that doesn't exist, this book is so realistic and dark and gruesome that I felt slightly queasy, like I was actually witnessing the dehumanization told of in the book. In that respect, it was extremely well-written. It was also horrifying. Rather like the novel equivalent of Batman: The Dark Knight."
2,Not a good read if you aren't into heavy techno talk,"Wolverine is my absolute fave X-men, and I was looking forward to reading this until I actually started reading. The book relies heavily on scientific techno jargon that I found boring with little action going on for Wolverine who seems to spend most of the book drifting in and out of memories that were only half lucid. While it can be interesting to learn about how and why he had the adamantium bonded to him, I wasn't really wanting to go as in-depth technically on the process. Great if you're a scientist or techno geek, but bad if you were just looking for a fun read. There are much better books out there that actually show more action and have less textbook explanation of things. Very disappointing overall."
3,Not so great,"Never got this model, was substituted for other, suposedly a better one, but the mayor problem was I hate the red color of the display and unfortunately i could not change it, no settings for that............. very dissapointed."
5,AWESOME PERFORMANCE FOR THE PRICE,"This product is way underrated. It has the features of many high end decks costing much more money. The color LED display is awesome. The power is outstanding. A MUCH BETTER DECK THAN ANY ALPINE, SONY, KENWOOD ECT. IN ITS CLASS PERIOD NUFF SAID!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best Nail Glue I've Ever Used,"I've been dealing with acrylic nails and nail glues now for 25 years, and this Big Bondini Hypo-Allergenic nail glue is the best I've ever used. Most importantly, I am so allergic to so many chemicals, and this glue didn't faze me whatsoever, as far as being harsh or causing any allergic reactions. The glue also held better than any other nail glue I've ever used. My only problem with it is that I live in a big city and despite researching all local resources, had to order it, i.e., read ""pay shipping,"" Other than that, it is a great, great product."
1,Big Bondini,"Big Bondini was a total flop. I bought it because it was hypo-allergenic and I am sensitive to other nail glues. Well, I could NOT tell a difference. I reacted just as strongly to this one. Very disappointed."
3,Golden Dome Doldrums,"This is a pretty standard by-the-numbers sports bio. Pat O'Brien's account of the legendary coach is flat and one-note. The game footage, whether documentary or re-enactment, doesn't inspire much awe. Ronald Reagan livens up the proceedings somewhat as star player George Gipp but his appearance is fleeting. I'm a fan of the Fighting Irish but this picture didn't get the juices flowing at all. Rent ""Rudy"" instead."
1,Knuke Rockne,"Was not pleased with item. It skipped constantly. i received a refund from seller but was told this item was purchased at the ""Dollar Store"" franchise. It seems the seller lost on this transaction and that doesn't seem right. The seller was honest and straight forward. They deserve better than this."
4,O'Brien plays Rockne,"Earlier in my life, I actually saw Pat O'Brien in person at a summer playhouse in Denver and he reinacted a few of the speeches, which he did of Knute Rockne in this film. It was great to see them again and now I can watch over & over, anytime I want. Also, a young Ronald Reagan plays a very interesting ""Gipper"" character. Didn't realize ""the Gipper"" was a walk-on at Notre Dame, ... or is that part just a Hollywood fantasy? Loved the old football footage."
5,Forget Rudy!,"Rudy is a legend in his own mind! He may have written a story that captures the spirit of young dreamers; however, Knute Rockne is the real deal! As a double domer from a domer family, Knute Rockne, the movie, was played in Washington Hall to the incoming freshmen at ND every year. Ronald Reagon portrayed the good side of the Gipper (domers know the naughty side) and it's a true inspiration. Rock, Gip, and the real ND players left it on the field of play and this movie tells the story of Notre Dame football's rise to legendary status. And, the campus shots are wonderful and the stuff memories are made of."
5,A Classic,"If you love Football and Notre Dame and stories of great coaches and their positive influence on young men, see this."
3,"Plenty of gaskets, as long as you don't need the broken one","Thermostat and gaskets I needed were fine. There was one ripped gasket in the package, luckily I didn't need that one."
3,Bach stories,"Hello, I am 12 years old, and as a 12 year old I thought this book was educational and funny. If I were interested in learning about music I would love to read this book. I disliked it though because it teaches kids to disobey your boss."
5,"Absolutely a MUST HAVE ""heart-wrenching"" Book!","This book is utterly captivating! The author literally pulls you into her life and heart-felt feelings as soon as you start reading it. She shares her experiences, her love of husband and family, as well as her intermost thoughts at the most perilous times of her life. She shows complete unselfishness in her ability to lead her family through all the ups and downs of ill health, surgery, death and heartache; while still trusting the lord with upmost faith. This book is a must have book! I would recommend this to all adults and children alike, as it provides so much strength and courage for all of us to use now, or to hold it into our hearts to use later on if we need it. This book would be great in our school libraries to build great character traits for our children and grandchildren."
5,Silicone valey,Pure House exoticness. Most of the songs would sound perfect in an acquatic/tropical enviroment and porcilon white tiles on the walls.
4,THE BOOK FOR PHYSICS,"I never bought the Halliday-Resnick book when I studied several Physics courses as an engineering undergraduate, but today, several years after graduation, I am considering buying it because of its immense value as a reference book (and my work doesn't have anything to do with Physics). I still remember all the other books quoted HR at some point. The weak point is, however, that for students who need step-by-step, spoonfed explanations, this is not the book, as it requires the reader to have a good level of Maths."
4,Four stars,"Explains most parts of physics very well. Slightly confusing chapter organization and smaller text size, but otherwise a good read."
2,Not Worth the Price,"As a fourth year college student the price of the book, for its content, is outrageuos. There are no real explanations on how the problems are solved, or even how they were derived. It is like push the ""I believe button"". I borrowed their third edition( Physics Part2) from my college library and wondered why they ever changed it. The fourth edition is an extremely condensed version and is hard to follow. Though they cover a lot of required material this book is lacking if a student wishes to learn from the book without a professor's aid.."
4,Excellent-this keyboad needs no repair,"Money Mark's Keyboard Repair reminds me of early 1970's experiments like Sly Stone'sThere's a Riot Goin onor Timmy Thomas'Why Can't We Live Together. These two artists used the organ's rhythm box as a backing track in their pre-digital work.This album won't be mistaken for a 1970's keyboard slice; you'll here a digital sheen identifying the music as modern. But these are delicious miniatures, simple little organ confections with melodic lines. Understated yet full. Like sketches from a master painter's notebook."
5,24x24 White Poly Mailers,Best product ever. We use everyday in our family business. Good quality product and the price is the reason we keep coming back to reorder.
1,poor quality,These mailers are said to be very strong and some of the best. They are so wrong these mailers are junk i might as well just ship thing in a grocery store bag. If you are sending boxes inside the bags then these are not for you.

5,No doubt about it...,"No doubt about it: this is the best written, best produced, best acted television show ever made. Each season, ""The Wire"" moves from strength to strength, resulting in a powerful ensemble work in which each character is given their due, and every scene has purpose and dramatic heft. I'm a fan of a lot of classy shows -- ""Buffy,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Deadwood,"" ""Freaks And Geeks,"" ""Lost,"" ""America's Next Top Model"" -- but none of them has had such a consistent track record. There hasn't been a slack or weak episode of ""The Wire"" yet, and the show just gets better and better. Comparing it to ""The Sopranos,"" for example, I'm shocked by how far down Tony and his crew have fallen off my radar... HBO allowed that show to devolve into a sitcom, whereas ""The Wire"" remains a taut, intelligent and richly clever drama... There's humor, too, but this show has real impact and depth.I'm just bummed I have to wait so long to see Season Four!"
5,Best show ever.,"This is the best TV show I've ever seen. I envy those of you who haven't seen it yet, as watching it for the first time was truly a wonderful experience. This is modern day Shakespeare."
5,It isn`t over!!!!!!!!! Say it ai`nt so,"A little denial on my part . I caught one show of the wire in the first season. I liked it so much I decided to surf for reviews of the cast and plot. After reading here, all the good reviews and rotten tomatoes, IMDB, ect. I purchased season one. I now have three season . And I do not want it to end. Ever, period . This collective is perhaps the most entertaining dialogue rich graphic urban grit of photography ever on any screen . Just is and amazing combinations of good people bad people, intertwined . Everything just came together in these work's. If you have the attention span of a six year old it might be just a little urban eye candy. Pay attention this series blazes A true light in the cinematic hinterlands. I wanna give it a ^6"
5,The Wire season #3 is the Best season for the best show,"Brings the focus back to the streets of baltimore, where season 2 was trapped between the waterfront, the street and prison and lacked focus. Season three starts strong and gets better."
5,The Wire season #3,"Season #3 is just as good as seasons one and two. I can't wate for season four. The actors are spot on with their roles. It is easy to belive that what you are seeing is real. The wrighting and story are great. You will want to watch all three seasons in correct order to keep the story line stright. And as with seasons one and two, put mom and the kids is another room when watching as it can get a wee bit randy and rank at times. I love this show, and don't ever want it to end. It is worth your time and money. Sit back and enjoy the ride."
4,"Review of My DVD Purchase of ""The Wire)",My husband actually ordered the dvd. HE LOVES IT! The turn around time for your deliveries is exceptional. I am also impressed with the turn around time when payment is made by check. Keep up the good work!
3,"A solid, if not better season","For better or worse, the third season of the Wire continues to have the same problems the first two seasons of the wire had. The slow pacing of the show, heavy handed dialog, and too many story lines to count continue to hold the show back from the greatness it deserves. Despite this, I found the subject matter in season three, ""reform"" or the lack thereof, extremely resonating and intriguing enough to keep me watching. I just wish that by season three more action and drama was utilized.As a documentary, lecture even, season three of the wire is great to watch. As a TV show thats moving and compelling, not so much. Maybe next year."
1,The Wire 3rd Season,The quality of the DVD's was good. However I did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons. It seemed that the story was setting up for season 4.
1,Bad Quality,Frequently buffering or simply cutting out- was not expecting this for an online video product I purchased. Unlikely to try this again.Thank you.
2,Slow moving,"The whole point of the wire is to be a very realistic interpretation of what these cops go through on an everyday basis. While I appreciate that, the series can be very dry and slow at times, certainly not what you would expect from a cop show."
4,The Wire Review,This show is unique in that it is so realistic that you think you are getting a personal inside look at street crime in the city of Baltimore. It is also fascinating to see how police deal with the declining problems of an inner city in America. The show draws you in after the first episode and you have to tune in each week to watch the story unfold. Can not wait to see season four.
5,I need the 4th Season!,"The Wire is a great show! After the 1st season I was hooked. Season 3 doesn't slow up. I would rank season 2 & 3 a slight step below Season 1, but they're all great. I can't wait to get Season 4 & 5 and finish off my collection of one of the greatest TV shows of all time."
5,The Best Season Ever!!!,"I am a huge fan of The Wire. I didn't really get into it until the middle of Season 3. I was so fascinated that I had to purchase the DVDs of Season 1, 2, and 3 to make sure I had seen everything. I believe that Season 3 is definitely the best thus far....."
5,The very best,"This is without question the best show on television, hands down. It's beyond me why so many people gravitate to HBO's other shows and overlook this gem. Don't make the same mistake!"
1,Shows the convictions of the former pope during his life time,"Many people believe that the former pope stood for the Word of God. If you read the book and honestly compare it's content with what the Bible says, you will find, that this was not true. Otherwise the book is a waist of time and it will be better spend if you read the Bible itself."
5,Inspirational,"This book is a look into the thoughts of a brilliant man, Pope John Paul II. It is very beautifully written, and easy to understand. I must admit to not wanting to read a ""religious"" book, but once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It really is an inspirational book for all people. A MUST READ!!!"
5,Crossing the Threshold of Hope,"This book is wonderful. Pope John Paul II answers a lot of questions in this book. If one wants to know why the Catholic church is the one true church created by Jesus Christ, then get this book.What I didn't like about the paperback is the fact that it is very narrow and difficult to hold comfortably."
2,Wrong ones,I order these a while back. These are NOT the correct sleeves/caps for my Cruzer Micro. The image that they provide is the one that I have but they caps they sell are for a different version of the cruzer's.
5,I like them,These coasters are very nice looking and work good at soaking up the sweat. They are heavy and stay in place
1,TERRIBLE!,"This British version of the Phantom is the worst I have ever seen. Right at the beginning of the movie, as soon as they show a shot of the ""Opera House"" You can tell that they shot the film at a rate just above a high school. The idea that the Phantom should have a servant is completely out of whack. Also, they could have done a better casting job on Christine, and they could have at least used her real last name. I also comment, the ""St. Joan"" opera was a piece of garbage that someone bagged out. I deeply protest that the Phantom would actually HIT Christine! HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOVE WITH HER!!! In conclusion, about the only thing related to the book is, Christine's first name. That's all."
1,Horrible!,"I cannot believe anyone in they're right minds would even enjoy this movie, its nothing but, putrified garbage that needs to be left in whatever film vault it fell out of!"
4,Oldie but Goodie,I still like this version of the Phatom of the Opera than all the others! I wish it was on DVD...
3,CHANEY'S VERSION IS STILL THE BEST! STILL OK 2 1/4 STARS!,"I must admit that 'The Phantom of the Opera' has never been my favorite horror film. This Hammer version in very short which is a good thing but, it really just lays there and does nothing. It's an OK watch for us old horror fans but, it is not the best version of this film and I rate it 2 1/4 stars. Amazingly, the silent version starring Lon Chaney has never been surpassed. Forget about paying top dollar for an old VHS tape. This is available on DVD with 7 other Hammer Horror films. The DVD transfer is very good and you can pick it up cheap, about half the price of what second market sellers are asking for this one film on VHS. It's called Hammer Horror series and has a picture of Oliver Reed's Werewolf on the cover."
3,A good watch.,"Although the film deviates from the original novel quite a bit, it's still a worthwhile watch. The music is good and even though the plot is changed, it's still cute. There are a few things that require quite a suspension of disbelief, and parts of the plot rather irked me, like the Phantom's nemisis getting away with stealing his music in the end, and that I was never sure whether he really loves Christine, or just wants to tutor her. Still, the movie does have it's good points, and for those who like the gorey horror movies there is a bit of blood in there."
3,Bought This For One Song,"iTunes doesn't have the English version of 'Coming Home', so I bought this album. I don't get why Peter Schilling was so big in Europe, I don't think he's that great. The title track is pretty good but I heard that it was produced later; it's got a rhythm similar to New Order's, True Faith. All the other tracks are fair to mediocre."
3,I agree with Music Fan,"Hey, I love Major Tom too, that's the only reason I was even looking at this CD. But honestly, Peter Schilling isn't a hidden gem, at least not until he makes some better songs than these. :) I love Major Tom and the title track for this album, but I could have lived the rest of my life without ever hearing the rest. :D"
4,sci-fi rock,"Peter Schilling was a visionary. He has followed in the footsteps of David Bowie in his imagination. The Different Story is a great pop song...I am pretty sure Limahl is featured on it. Major Tom is an 80's classic (4-3-2-1)..we all remember it. Other standouts include the Noah Plan, Berlin (a hauntingly beautiful song, years before it's time) and The lone Survivor. Buy this record...I think you will be very suprised. And for Peter Schilling fans, it's all we have. Peace."
5,One of the best cds ever made !!!!!,"I bought this cd about four years ago and I have constantly played it (it is now a standard in my home) the songs are in a electric dream state that stays within a science fiction theme The lone survivor, a World of Lust and crime, The noah plan.... everyone I have played the cd for has purchased it for themselves... do yourself a real favor and get something unusual.. you might enjoy it as much as me...."
5,a lot of fun,"My friend and I had to do volunteer work as seniors in high school. We heard Major Tom on the radio one day, bought this cd the next day, and listened to it for about two months straight after that. Some of the songs are dark and full of emotion (city of night). Some really make me laugh (US under Disneyland). I loved this album. He's got a great voice."
5,This Album Deserves More Respect Than It Received,"While not all the songs Peter Schilling did were great, it's his production quality that makes the difference. The album, ""Error In The System"" had some of the best production quality for synthesized music ever done. I'm putting this review here because this is the American Version and I don't have the German version of ""Error In The System"" (maybe I should get it sometime).I read one review of the album which said ""Error In The System"" became the album by which all albums with synthesizers were judged afterward and I believe it.Peter Schilling shouldn't be classified as a ""One Hit Wonder."""
1,Deception in Description of Product and No Response from Seller,"The DVD was advertised as ""Like New"". It arrived in sealed box, however the quality was unacceptable: many deep scratches, large blank video and audio areas. The seller never responded to my email. The return policy not included on Amazon. I disputed the purchase with my credit card. Very dissapointing experiance with buying over the Amazon.com."
4,"Good grammatical tips, easy to navigate","As a professional writer/editor, I rely on my resources like this one for my daily work. This book covers important topics and uses good examples."
4,An ideal reference for the grammatically challenged.,"Whether you are brushing up on your grammar, or you were never very good at it, ""Grammatically Correct"" is an excellent reference. It is clear, concise, and easy to follow. I agree with a previous review that the chapter should be listed at the top of the pages for easy flipping, but it's something one can easily forego.This book covers a wide array of common oversights not just in the world of English grammar but spelling and punctuation as well.There have been times where I have argued with my computer when it flagged something with a grammatical error, but I now know what it was talking about.This reference has proven to be very useful both at home and at work."
2,Okay but Flawed,"First, my hardback version came poorly bound and the pages are likely to begin falling out soon. Second, the book indeed presents some good grammar rules, but it is rather simplistic overall (i.e., 8th grade like), so do not expect anything too great or cool grammar constructions to impress your peers. Lastly, I found several grammar problems in the text itself (e.g., on page 90 it states ""These [should be there] is essentially no difference in meaning between these pairs of sentences""), which is quite shocking for a grammar book!"
2,"Poorly organized, difficult to navigate","There may be some very helpful information in this book, but it is near impossible to find any of it. The index is missing some seemingly obvious entried, and the the table of contents isn't all that helpful either. You'd be better off with the Chicago Manual of Style, which contains everything you could possibly want to know, and is much better organized."
2,Incomplete,"Anne's newer book is much more complete. I don't usually need a book on grammar because I don't normally write formally. But I do need a good reference book for those times. In this book, important items are omitted that are included in her newer book of similar nameGrammatically Correct: The Essential Guide to Spelling, Style, Usage, Grammar, and Punctuation. For instance, try to find anything on verb mood in this book and you'll be disappointed. Interestingly, the word, ""verb,"" doesn't even show up in the index. Hmmmm... and I thought this was a grammar book."
1,style,"The book begins by essentially quizzing the reader. I don't care what the rationale for this is. If you want to feel further discouraged by grammar, this book is for you."
1,misleading title,"Despite what the book title ""Grammatically Correct"", this book is mostly about punctuation usages. Grammar is limited to a thin, single chapter. There are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages, let alone correct them.I would recommend ""Painless Grammar"" over this title."
2,Grammatically Correct: paperback,"I am certain that this is an invaluable book for those needing writing help. Yet, there is an extreme drawback to this book, for no matter how well written this book may be, the paperback version is produced with a mere 8 point font throughout-making the book seriously unreadable.If you need the writing help I suggest you spring for the more expensive version of the book, or better yet just buy the latest edition of Punctuate it Right! by Harry Shaw."
4,"Good information, needs better index.","I am a nontraditional college student, and have forgotten quite a bit about punctuation and grammar. I needed a good reference for my writing classes. This is a good source, and walks the reader through each concept, but you cannot find information quickly. For example, I needed to know how to set off the name of a ship; does it go in italics, or quotation marks? I had to guess and look under each to find the answer. The answers are there, and this book has become valuable, but it needs a better index."
5,A Must Have,These LED headlights are a great purchase. I bought one for myself last year and used it frequently when looking for items in the attic and other dark areas. I was so impressed I bought them for my two adult sons as gifts. They are usually on sale and I highly recommend these headlights.
4,Good product for the price,"I am very happy with this product. I have an LL Bean headlamp, but like the output rays on this one better. I also like the red light option."
5,"SUPER bright, super tough, a joy!","These lights were incorporated into a stage costume. They were super bright and the switch from red to white was easy to do with the big switch. The lights got kicked around A LOT, but stayed bright and functional! A well-made product, I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for such a light and I expect to buy these again! Thanks for such a great product!"
3,50/50 chance of working,I ordered two of these head lamps and only one of them works. the other one was flickering after 10 minutes of use. think they would be great...if they worked.
4,Nice headlight,"Nice headlight for the money. Great for that night time dog walk. I wouldn't want to wear it for hours on end, but for less than an hour - fairly comfortable."
5,It is as advertised,"Good product, does what it says it does. I have found other uses for it than what I originally intended (morning walks in the dark). If you need to work in a dark place, eg under the sink, it is perfectly suited to shed light on your subject! Good value, would buy it again."
4,Nice product.,Gift for a nephew for Christmas. He was happy to receive it. I was pleased especially with the brightness of the lamp.
3,Yeah it's okay,"Well, you get what you pay for... It's doing the trick but the plastic body is really flimsy! Almost broke when I tried to open the battery compartment. Really poor quality but the LED is really bright, fairly comfortable. Bought it mostly for emergencies around the house requiring the use of both my hands..."
3,Good in the Dark,This headlamp works well on camping trips when you need to have hands free for other activities. The white light is bright for easy visibility in the dark. The red light option is especially good when you are entering/leaving a tent and don't want to disturb your fellow bedmates.
5,Perfect for camping or night time excursions,"The red lamp is very handy at night to enable your eyesight to adjust to darkness quicker than traditional white light. The headband fits snugly and the toggle switch is easy to use for on/off or choosing the white or red lights. Lightweight and the angle of the lights is adjustable, so you can point the light in the direction to best suit your needs."
4,Excellent for the Price,"I use this light for increasing illumination in a dark space, like inside a chainsaw fuel tank or down an herbicide applicator tube. I also use it for predawn work either to briefly light an area or to keep a light on an area I am weeding. The white light is nice and bright. Ability to use standard rechargeable batteries is good and the red light is useful when I don't want to attract too much attention. A top of the head strap would keep it from slipping and make it 5 stars but a light with a top of the head strap wasn't in the budget."
4,Good lamp,I got this because it has the option to use a red light which I needed for a ghost hunting trip. (so as not to mess with the recording equipment.) It worked very well. The white light is super bright and the red light illuminates enough to see in the immediate area. Good lamp for the price.
4,Fair to good buy!,"That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!"
3,Great buy for the price,Great product. Used it for camping and my kids loved it. Not as bright as I would have liked but still did the job. The only issue I had was the switch. I would sometimes have to mess with it to stay on. If you pushed it a little too much to the right or left it would turn off. Other than that issue it was good.
3,Helpful in dark places,I've been able to use this to do yardwork after dark. I purchased one with three LEDs for my mother--probably better choice.
2,Not even close to 30 lumens,"Ok, it's a handy little light that is very easy to use. The switch goes right for white, and left for red. It works fine in a very dark room or when doing close up work, like the inside of a computer case, or tying up fishing lines. However, it's not even close to 30 lumens - more like 10 - so don't buy this thinking it's going to light your way to paradise. It's not even very good for any outdoor uses beyond arm's reach.There are better options out there for the price. The Energizer 7 LED headlamp is far superior to this one, for only a couple of dollars more. The Energizer 7 does throw 30-50 lumens, and has more switching options, and is much sturdier. Go for that one instead of this one."
4,"Bright, comfortable, and adjustable.",This is comfortable and did come with batteries. It is very bright on the light setting. It also has a red light. I tried to read with the red light but I can't. The white light is better. It can be angled up or down.
5,handy,Comes in Handy Post Sandy!!!great hands free light when you have to worry about holding handrails and opening doors. would buy again
5,I carry these characters with me,"This book has left me with a profound connection with these characters, and so when I closed the cover of the book for the last time, the characters remained with me. Beth, Akiva and Tsippi have been so richly drawn, and as well, Jerusalem itself is a character, with descriptions so vivid a photograph develops in the mind's eye while reading, and I go along for the journey along with the characters. So when I closed the book, the characters are now here with me, as they now go along with me on my future journey."
4,good easy read.,It takes you back to the city of Jerusalem and into the lives of jewish women as well as religious men. The study of torah is beautifully expressed. recommend.
3,worth reading,"In many ways, this was a wonderful book. It depicted the deep care that Orthodox women have for their faith. It also showed how difficult it is to chose a ""match"". Men, too. A life match is not to be chosen lightly.I have one small problem with this book, the condition that one of the character's has does not exist, as far as I can tell. I tried to do research on asperclonus.....and found nothing. Nothing that will not be a problem in reading and enjoying the wonderful story; it may save the interested reader resarch on what does not seem to exist."
5,a delicious read! a rare treat. could not put it down,"This book was absorbing from the very beginning. Lovable characters including all their flaws. Reminded me we are all a work in progress. Also reminded me that when the time is right, anything can happen. Not some cheesy novel, this is gorgeously done but not overdone. Ruchama's humor throughout kept me glued to the pages and relishing what was coming next. Leaves you with a better understanding of people overall...."
5,Seven Blessings,"I really enjoyed this book. After just recently losing my husband and mother, this book seemed like a balm to my soul. It was an escape into a culture that takes the L-rd and his commandments seriously. It made me want to move to Jerusalem and be a part of it all, however unlikely, since I am not Jewish. How wonderful to read a book about love and marriage without all the worldliness and sinfulness that usually goes along with most stories with these themes. Thank you, Ruchama, for an inspiring and uplifting read."
3,Unedited is better,"I had stayed away from Barbara Steele films, since they were all blasted by reviewers stating they were disjointed, didn't offer anything new and others. I read that the completed version of Nightmare Castle was available and liking horror movies figured it was worth a shot, as it is considered her best horror effort. It was better than I expected. The film has a moody atmosphere and has a decent horror plot and a satisfying ending. It isn't a classic, but you do get to see what got the world interested in Barbara Steele. It is dubbed"
3,"Good Barbara, poor quality.","An amusing, not so scary little film. Barbara Steel is always good though so worth watching if you like her. The quality is not good however. Grainy and a poor transfer."
2,"Through Amazon, you can buy from J&R, Delphi SA10224 SKYFi 3 for $27","Through Amazon, I bought Delphi SA10224 SKYFi 3 (portable unit) for $27 (car kit and shipping included). Price is after a $30 rebate from J&R.; It is a more modern and smaller unit. The home kit is extra; Check fatwallet for coupons.I have an old Tao2go that still works, but it is almost obsolete and too big to be portable."
3,good design,"The engineering of this is a little sub par. The back panel barely fits on. The nails have to be angled just to make it fit. It is designed heavier, with oversized pieces where not necessary. I will say that at least it is mainly made up of true plywood and solid wood, not particleboard or fiberboard. I bought two the same, so I know that one was just not a manufacturing defect. For the price, the quality of design should have been higher, but it wasn't. The packaging is not good either. The corner of the box was crumpled, so a corner of one the pieces (the top) was also slightly crumpled."
5,Right up there with Flatland,"Thanks to whoever conceived the idea of publishing a combined version of Flatland and Sphereland - I would probably have never read this book otherwise - its under-known and under-rated. As a satire, Flatland is arguably better, but as a popular math / physics book, I find Spherland of a much higher quality. I would go so far as to say that there is no better way to understand conceptually the notion of a curved space than to read Burger's analogy. Get it before it goes out of print!"
3,I loved the special features,"The special features on the DVD were great. From the ""Make up an injury for big ben"" game to the ""How to fix a superbowl, narrated by Roger Goodell"", best ever."
3,Commentary,When I first watched the games I thought that it was interesting that they had the local radio guys doing it instead of the CBS/ABC broadcast team. Most sets have the network broadcast. Then I realized that the NFL probably didn't want John Madden explaining to the audience how the refs were handing the game to the Steelers on a silver platter. I'm sure the original Super Bowl broadcast is probably harder to find than the Ark of the Covenant.
2,help..!!,"two aliens in humen form..a fugitive and a cop..both fly down to earth following each other..they blow cars..kill cops..take a lady doctor hostage..the rest of the film was suppose to b a suspence flick..where u dnt know who is the bad alien and which one is the good alien..it just doesnt works..it doesnt thrills you..doesnt scares you..doesnt even makes u laugh..still interested..go watch dolph lurdegens ,""I come in peace"""
4,A terrific book,"I really like the energy and thought that went into this book. Sanbonmatsu takes up the real concerns of progressives today -- what can be done to change the political directions of the world, and to make the world a better place in which to live. I especially liked his critical review of postmodern theory, theory that is clever but, unlike the work of Marx, for example, offers no hope or solutions to the critical problems in the world. The author provided a compelling critique of this line of work. Just wish he had a better set of solutions than he offered at the end."
4,Model Aircraft has good detail for price,"I would like to start this review by saying that the XB-70 Valkyrie item I purchased is not a toy, it is a model airplane that has to be assembled and on the box it is rated age 14 or older. The review questions on Amazon refer to it as a toy.The model has pretty good detail for a model I paid less than $10 dollars for, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
2,very disappointed,It reminded me of old fashioned granny perfume smells. No offense. It was just too powdery smelling. And not very distinctive.
1,"1,000,000 stars for the show. 1 star for the price.","I've bought all the seasons in this site, I have the fourth season on pre-order. I bought season 1 back in June at 25 bucks, a month later, got the third season at 40 bucks and a few weeks ago I bought the second season at 40.49 bucks, add 39 more bucks for the fourth season and what do you have? 144.49 dollars!!!!! The price on the first three seasons bundle-set is just plain stupid!!"
1,I agree,"Don't get me wrong, I love this show. Call it an addiction for me that no 12-step program could ever cure, but I'd have to be 10 kinds of stupid to buy this set at this price when I can buy the first & second season bundled, and buy the third season separately, and pay much less. I'd recommend buying all seasons of The Wire.....but not like this.1 star, because there's no ""no star"" option."
2,Knew As Little At The End As i did At The Begining,"Greer Gaeson was a quiet and reserved person who became Queen of the metro lot by playing mainly in custome dramas,albeit that her most famous role was in The Miniver Story.She wanted to play contemporary roles,and when she did,in ""Adventure"" she came a cropper from which her career never recovered.Now neither she or her films are well remembered which is little surprising.The problem with this book is that it tells us very little.Hardly surprising when the author mainly relies on fan magazine interviews and MGM press handouts for quotes of Garson.So for example we dont really know what possessed her to marry her first husband or divorce her second.Why arent we given some idea as to why she never had a child.Would it have interefered with her career?What did she leave in her will and to who.I just found the book to be rather uninteresting and uninvolving.For fans only."
3,OK,"This movie just seems to be missing something and I'm just not quite sure what it is. Its entertaining enough, but a little hard to follow. Definately a rent it before you buy it movie. With a Cast of Stars I was expecting more. But who knows, you might like it."
3,A fun watch... if nothing else is available,"I don't think this show was a horrible as most of the reviews make it out to be. Okay, I'll admit that it's not a GREAT show, but it's a cute little one-timer that's enjoyable late at night.Owen Wilson (how did he become famous with that nose?) plays a small time con who's bouncing around Hawaii trying to make a quick buck or two. As in all of his roles, he does such a comfortable job of being fun and easy to watch that he literally saves the show. Add to that a light-hearted resort owner played by Morgan Freeman, a grungy, wife cheating thug played by Charlie Sheen, and top it off with an unexpected twist at the end, and you've got all the ingredients for a fun ninety minutes.It won't be the funniest or the most memorable comedy you've ever seen, but if you make a double header of the evening with a suspense thriller and a bowl of popcorn, it will be a great night.Enjoy!"
3,the only reason why i watched the movie,"The film was ok, so i gave it 3 stars, but the only reason why i even wanted to watch the movie was because of Sara Foster who is drop dead hot, the plot was ok, the jokes were funny. 3 stars overall."
1,WHY MORGAN FREEMAN HERE?,"Remember ""The Quick And The Dead""? I wondered why such an all star (Hackman, Stone, De Caprio, Crowe, etc) cast would appear in such a mediocre play -one of the worst movies ever made-; well... I tought that was it, one blunder in film history is ok! But...here we go again: Morgan Freeman, my hero!, one of the most respectable and underrated actors ever, ouch!. I bought the movie because of him! Don't get me wrong: his acting is simple impecable; just a natural born actor. But the movie, oh no!, a comedy with no humor...a thriller with no suspense. Why Morgan? Why?Not everything is bad: Foster's anatomical display is the highlight and Bebe Neuwirth looks very hot and adorable.Fortunately, is a short movie. And it will probably be also short lived."
2,what happened?,horrible boring movie that neither funny nor entertaining.though one actress: Anahit Minasyan is very pretty. thats it!!!don't waste your money on this either to buy or to rent. its a really bore. its stupid and dull.
2,owen? come on!,"am i the only one who is sick and tired of owen wilson playing the same damn character in every single movie he makes? yes, i understand that the clueless hero is a hysterical character to watch, but it's only funny once in a while. come on, owen! snap out of it. give me something else for a change."
4,Just a laid back island movie,"If you put this DVD in expecting a riveting, nail-biting caper, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you want a funny, light-hearted movie where the splendid island backdrops are an omni-present character of the ensemble cast, this is a great movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a rum drink in hand."
1,WHAT CRAP THIS WAS!!!,"I couldnt even stand to see the whole thing! My god, Owen Wilson is a good actor, but definatly not in this bullcrap, dammit! Theres basically NOTHING going on but what's his name and what's her name going out, and ita a horrible date! DONT BUY IT, DONT RENT IT, STAY AWAY EVEN IF YOURE A DIE HARD FAN OF OWEN WILSON OR MORGAN FREEMAN!!!"
2,Not the best,"Many of the books in this series are better than this one. The selection of items and pictures is odd, and the mirror on the last page distorts baby's face like something out of a funhouse. Skip this one in the series."
3,Adult view - just ok; Child view - love it!,"I have never been that impressed by this book, although, to be fair, I'm not really a big fan of novelty/touch books in general. However, I have to say this was one of my daughter's favorite books when she was about 6-12 months old. She wanted to read it over and over and over. Now she's two and hasn't touched it in more than 6 months, so I'm going to pass it on to another child who can love it more.Not a bad gift.. there may be others in the series that are better though -- there isn't much variety in this one (the curtain and the towel are similar experiences, as are the kitty and bear fur). I think the touch book concept is sound for that 6-12 month age range, but maybe explore some other books before buying this one."
2,Not one of the better Touch and Feel books,"Compared to other books in the series, this book is my daughter's least favorite. The items in the house are boring, at least for an infant (OK, even for an adult). Would you rather see a baby rabbit or a hanging towel? And who still hangs their clothes out to dry? Many of the textures are almost the same (the fur of the bear and the fur of the cat, the towel and the curtain). I think the cat picture is actually repeated in another book. Check out Touch and Feel Bathtime, Farm, and Pets instead."
3,"Good Race, Poor DVD","This was for sure a good race. However, going 2 and a half hours without the graphics from the 'on air' broadcast is pretty bad. Not knowing what lap or place your driver is, gets frustrating. So this product gets 3 stars for being an incomplete DVD."
5,2000 Winston 500,Fantastic Great Race Miss You Dale Sr Proud To Have This One For My DVD Collection Will Watch This One Over And Over
5,If there's one new discovery in the horror genre...,"this is it... an impressive, well made serious feature"
3,Will work for some,"Unfortunately I have a large gap between my door and frame. I was hoping this magnetic stripping would do the trick. And I think it would have worked if the magnets were stronger. If I go outside and physically stick the stripping to the door sliding my fingers all the down the stripping, it stays. But unfortunately just by closing the door it doesn't work. I think the product will work for most provided they don't have a large gap."
5,This one is right on target,"These tapping exercises and phrases are right on target for me. They get to core issues and I have begun to see some results already. Also, I do the exercises right before I go to sleep at night and I sleep much better!"
3,It's good but not great!,I guess I just expected too much. I should have read more reviews before I made my purchase. I will know better next time
4,Circle the Caribbean with Jimmy,"You can't take a road trip to the Caribbean but if you could, this is the book you'd pack. Jimmy Buffet took an extended trip with friends and family to a number of fantastic places.I've been to a couple of the spots, as a tourist. Jimmy had the chance to travel the region and share his experiences with us.Makes a good gift for a guy who likes to travel and explore."
2,"Oh, How Self-Centered He's Become!!","OK Jimmy. We get it now. You're the fabulous Jimmy Buffett and we're not. Enough already. This book is not so much autobiographical as it is bragging. ""Don't you wish you could live your life like me"", Buffett seems to say. Enough with the ""he who dies with the most toys, wins"" credo and stick to your music. Better yet, sell all your ""toys"" instead of ""selling out"" and get back to the basics. Your music has suffered for years because of the swelled head. As in his music, Buffett has peaked early in his attempt at writing. Stick to telling short stories like ""Tales to Margaritaville"". We already know how stinking rich you are; your legions of Parrotheads made you the success you are today. No need to brag and rub our noses in it."
3,No More Hang-Overs for Mr. Buffett,"I bought this book not because I am a big parrothead, just because I am interested in the locales he has traveled to. He wrote this in diary style which I like much better than the normal layout. He journals his travels through the tropics. I admire Buffett for his sobriety and honesty about his wild past. Buffett claims in this book he had to stop drinking because the hang-overs became more like recovering from surgery. (tequila will do that!)It does get a bit egocentric here and there, but then again he deserves that I guess. Read it for the fun adventures he has visiting locales around the equator and the vivid descriptions. 3 1/2 stars."
5,A Wanderer's Fantasy,"Reading this travelogue was the most fun I've had in a long time. I've always fantasized about touring the back ways of South America just like some 1940's adventurer. Jimmy does just that. His is a fine culture study of Latin American locales interspersed with autobiographical bits about Buffet himself that every good Parrot Head should know.I still want to do a tour like this myself one day, but unless I become independently wealthy, I may have to settle for rereading this book. Fortunately, it's a vivid and fun narrative, so it might be just as good as a trip down the Amazon."
3,Travels with Jimmy; ride along with Parrothead #1,"While not a literary work of art, this book is a good read for a beach vacation. Accompany Jimmy on his travels through the tropics as he comments on middle age, fishing, flying and having fun."
4,This book is a must read for all Jimmy Buffett fans!,"I would reccommend this book to anyone who likes Jimmy Buffett and books about adventure. This is a very adventurous book. It seems that after everything he does to get out of something, he gets back into it or another problem arises. He is descriptive in telling about things that happened to him and the places he went to during his trip to the Caribbean. If you liked his other books, you will love this one. It is easy to follow and makes you want to keep reading it. Once you start , you won't want to put it down. If your into Jimmy Buffett, and adventure, read this book. You won't be disappointed. Submitted by: Robert Everett END"
4,"""How I spent my winter vacation"", Jimmy Buffett-style","Only someone with the motivation - and means - of Jimmy Buffett could have pulled off such an effort without it sounding like the ramblings of a spoiled rock star. Fortunately, Buffett the author is as talented as Buffett the songwriter; Parrotheads everywhere will no doubt laud this work, both for its insights into Buffett's life, as well as for its obvious value as a travelogue. We join Jimmy as he celebrates reaching the half-century mark in such exotic locales as Costa Rica, Cartaghena, the Amazon and the farthest reaches of the Carribbean island chain. His observations about life in these parts and the balance that he attempts to maintain as father/husband/rock star/pilot/fly fisherman make for entertaining reading, and his writing style - in brief ""stream of consciousness"" bursts - is as straightfoward and enjoyable as a cold beer (or rum drink!) on a hot summer day."
5,Just like that special fish - a real keeper!,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book with the same anticipation as any of Bubba's CD's. I was not disappointed. Maybe it is the fact that I maintain a summer home in the Northern Caribbean (Gulf Shore, AL)or that my daddy flew an albatross as a Coast Guard officer, who knows. All I know is that it is that this book takes me to the beach and the islands whenever I want to go. I was so disappointed to finish it that I was ready to read it again immediately, but I will wait until I go ""Back to the Beach"" next month. Jimmy, see you at the Flora-Bama.Fins Up! See all you Dallas parrot heads on September 24."
5,"If you live by his music, you'll love this book!!","This book reiterates everything that he sings about in his wonderful songs. I especially loved reading the sections that dealt with his children (swimming nekkie in a waterfall, etc.). Jimmy helps us dream and, with the help of this book, he stretches the dream just a little farther. I also think that non-Parrotheads will enjoy this book."
5,Another laid-back beach book by Jimmy!!,"He has done it again! This is definately the book you want to take to the beach and relax with. He tells his stories of flying, fishing, singing and all of his other passions in life. He really lets the reader in and does a great job! Another enjoyable read by the king of fun and adventure!"
2,Still Waiting For Buffett Biography,"If you were hoping to read a Jimmy Buffett biography, you will still be waiting after you complete ""A Pirate Looks At Fifty"". This book is not for the sun-bleached parrothead hoping to read about Buffett's sailing days. In ""A Pirate Looks At Fifty"", he babbles on endlessly about flying and fly-fishing. Maybe he was hoping to gain a new following of pilotheads."
1,Boring/repetative,"Who cares how many planes, houses and hunting lodges he has or the fact that he makes pancakes for the kids. Its a pretty much rub your face in it. I'm rich your not"
2,WELL...,"The first half of the book made sense. The rest is just a history and a daytrip of the Amazon and the Islands he flies over. He lands on a couple but sort of zips by them way too fast. If you want a much better description of the Amazon, read John Grisham's 'The Testament'. I really think he should've concentrated more on either doing a traveloge or a biography. This mixed bag gets annoying flipping between Central and South American history and his life. He should've gave us the bar stories of his life in music and on and off the stage or a really good story of his travels that made him into the man he is. Not a small combination of the two."
2,Written In Response to the Unauthorized Biography?,"Jimmy Buffett's ""A Pirate Looks At Fifty"" is a disappointing book because he couldn't decide whether to write an autobiography or a travel diary. His stories of his travels didn't excite me that much. To me, it was just a way to brag to the reader about his toys and his wealth. I don't fault him for these things; he's earned them, but it just got old after a while. I would have loved more of a retrospective of his life (to date) from his standpoint, since the unauthorized biography written about him a few years ago was very poorly written. I think Jimmy needs to ditch writing books (his novels/short stories aren't that great either) and lousy musicals and get back to what got him where he is today, and that is making entertaining music which tell great stories in (usually) less than four minutes."
2,Jimmy can do better than this!,"I am very disappointed in this offering from Jimmy Buffet. It is obvious that he had a contract to honor and just cranked this book out. Margaritaille was funny and adventurous. This is just a diary and not a very interesting one. I am one ""parrot head"" that won't be buying any more of his books. I doubt I will finish this one."
5,Great Stories From A Great Storyteller,"Jimmmy Buffett tells great stories through his songs and his other books. This is a definite addition to any Parrot Heads library. Even non Parrot Heads will enjoy this trip through the Caribbean, and stories from early in his career."
2,Superficial Boredom,If you like airplanes and Jimmy Buffett than this is the book for you. I found it rambling with uninteresting details such as his packing list for his trip and the contents of his flight bag. Its not well written and if the author wasnt Jimmy Buffet than noone would read it. I do love his music and was hoping for more of his life's juicy details. You know he has tons to tell but isnt sharing.
2,"Disappointing, just an advertisement for his CDs,concerts,et","I found this book to be disappointing. Jimmy serves up the same old stuff, barely warmed over. His near constant references to his songs, concerts and earlier books serve as thinly disguised advertisements for those other products. I wish Jimmy would become a little more original."
2,Tres Ya Ya No,"This book reminds me of Jimmy's Margaritaville souvenier store/resturant in Key West--all style and no substance. I don't doubt that 25 years ago, he was sincerely a vagabond poet/pirate, but come on, how much of a vagabond can you be on a Grumann Albatross packed with family, friends, servants, gear, and people willing to fly your two kids back to Florida for a few days so you can fish? I am happy Jimmy has the sort of lifestyle than enables him to spend money foolishly, he's earned it. I just don't choose to read about his methods of doing it. I'm disappointed, it seems to be Jimmy has sold out, when he really didn't need to. What makes it even more sad, is the fact he hung in there all those years, resisted becoming a Yuppie sellout, and now that he's fifty, he's reversed everything he's accomplished in the past. The book was a nice piece of mind candy to pass a few hours with, but don't take this book on vacation with you--it will only make you feel discontented."
1,"disappointing,particularly for a parrothead",please return to the imaginative short stories that you weave so well.this book appears to be a way to get a long central/south american vacation paid for by a publisher.i had to force myself to finish.
2,"Big, big disappointment","As an avid reader, this book took me the longest to read in quite some time. I couldn't believe I have been reading this since July and I have finally finished. What a bore! The first few chapters on his planes and turning 50 were Buffett all the way, but once his journey started, it bored the hell out of me. My wife read this first and she is a huge Parrothead and she even struggled to get through this inflated tome of ego and geography. This book should have been subtitled: ""A trip with a middle-aged ex-hippie man with his toys.""Sorry, but this is not the classic all those Parrotheads are claiming it to be."
2,Not as engaging as I hoped,"I love Jimmy Buffet and had high hopes of a rollicking read of his life and trevails around the Caribbean. I found the book fairly disjointed without much continuity and spending too much word space on some very mundane things. This probably would have been better with a good cowriter. I became bored with it, and didn't quite finish it."
2,A Pleasant but Empty Book,I like biographies and I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan but I just couldn't get interested in this book. He uses his sea-plane and travels as the literary vehicle for this book but his heart just doesn't seem to be in the whole thing. My guess is that if he wasn't on the hook to produce another book this one would not have been written.
3,"Interesting life, boring vacation","I enjoyed very much the autobiography portion of Jimmy's book. He leads a most interesting life as you can imagine. His life experiences relate very well to us who lead more common lives. He is a very good writer and the stories he tells are most enjoyable and fun. I really enjoyed this book until the recount of his extended Caribean vacation, which as it turns out, wasn't very interesting. Unfortunately, it seems that about one third of the book was devoted to this boring trip."
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge Parrothead, but I just couldn't get into this book. I either want a real autobiography (about his whole life, not just about a trip he took with stories from his life randomly inserted) or another great work of fiction like Where is Joe Merchant? Skip this one, and wait for the next."
4,A fellow Pascagoulan finds his memories quite nostalgic.,"Having grown up in Pascagoula, Mississippi and gone to U. of Southern Mississippi a few years after Jimmy, I relate to his stories of the Coast in the 60's and 70's. I sure as hell wish I could relate a little more with his trip to the Carribean with his whole crew, including friends, nannies and aircraft crew. But ya know what? I would do the exact same thing if I was a star."
2,Maybe you have to be a guy?,"I am a female Jimmy Buffett fan and was looking forward to reading about his music and his life as a musician in this book. Instead, I get stories about fishing and plane crashes. I couldn't even finish this and I very, very seldom quit a book in the middle. Maybe this was designed to appeal more to his male fans, or nonfans interested in travel, but it didn't do anything for me. Next book, Jimmy?"
1,an unreadable ego trip,"A treatise on how to be boring, patronizing, and egotistical. Don't waste your money."
2,Highly Disappointing,"A Pirate Looks at 50 is a lackluster effort by my musical hero, Jimmy Buffett. This is not the definitive autobiography parrotheads were hoping for. It seems like something he cranked out to fulfill a contractual obligation with a publisher.Where are the colorful stories that come through in Buffett's music? The details of Buffett's life that we read in this book are mundane, such as the lengthy account of what kind of duffel bag he likes to carry (really!). It also seems that this is a sterilized version of his life, like he has cut out all the unseemly parts that would make for interesting reading.Stick to Buffett's fiction or his music and avoid this disappointing book that is very difficult to read and will burst your impression of this musical legend."
1,Marvin Gardens must be rolling over in his grave.,"I did not realize how rich Jimmy was until he told me. I didn't realize how famous he was until he told me. I didn't realize that he has traveled the world until he told me. Jimmy...get over it. I understand that people change in their lifetime, and musical tastes evolve, but what Jimmy has evolved into is an embarrassment. What he once did for the love of his art is now done because he knows faithful fans will buy whatever he puts out. Your time has come and gone. It's a shame that you sold out."
2,"Boring, where are the pearls of wisdom?????","I have always enjoyed Jimmy Buffet's music. Changes in Lattitudes Changes in Attitudes is one of the best albums I have ever purchased. His version of Biloxi is wonderful. I purchased this novel to learn more about the author of such great music, however after reading this book all I can say is boring. So you grew up Catholic, so you got divorced, so you can fly a plane, so what! Where are the inspirational aspects of your life that lead you to write these songs? Where are the contributions to society you have made? Please Jimmy stick to music, fly fishing, and your family."
1,An understanding of every pirate in your life,This book gives a unique birds eye view into the lives of those in our life that have a sense of freedom and adventure. I vicariously lived thru him as I turned the pages. Great book!A Pirate Looks at Fifty
5,This is a great book!,"I am only about 50 pages into the book, but what I have read is brilliant. BUFFET IS GREAT. I love the book becuase it tells the real story of his life from the guy who lived it. This is one of the greatest books I have ever decided to read. I can't wait to finish this book. PARROT HEADS must read this book!"
4,"Entertaining, rambling, and fun","I own no Jimmy Buffett music, but all three of his books. I found this to be less entertaining than his previous two, which I loved, but that is primarily because it's true. Fiction is more fun than real life! But Buffett here provides great summer escapist reading, especially for those of us who work too hard. Jimmy reminds us to take the time to have some fun. He and I have different perspectives on life, but he is a greatly appreciated incentive to relax and enjoy the ride...."
3,Not as good as his others,"This book was good, but not the type like his others that I just couldn't put down. Also it was labeled as a Autobio. It is not really that. It has a little about his but it is really on what his thinks of life and things that occur in his adventure a cross the Carribean Sea."
4,Excellent!!,"For all of those people who don't have time to sit down read everyday, this book is perfect. Each chapter is a story of it's own. This book is great for a Jimmy Buffet fan to really learn more about the man behind the music."
3,Stick to the travelogue.,"When Jimmy writes about the Hemisphere Dancer, and where it did or did not land, he is at the top-of-his-game. Even his stories of New Orleans, and his early days on the road are funny, entertaining,and interesting. But, when he begins to write about his philosophy of life, and how we are destroying the planet then the book becomes boring, and redundant. I still enjoy Jimmy Buffet as a storyteller,and would probably buy his books in the future.If he sticks to what he does best...tells a story."
3,Had potential but fell short,"As a Parrothead I was excited about this book especially after Tales from Margaritaville, and Joe Merchant. I enjoyed the historical background, (what little of it there was) and the stories about his early years before he made it big. I enjoy his music but frankly I don't really care what he does on vacation."
3,Does Jimmy really know about flying?,"Jimmy's flying stories and logs have so many apparent inaccuracies and misapprehensions (that an experienced pilot wouldn't commit) that I believe either that Jimmy gets all his technical aviation thinking done by his employees, or someone else wrote the book. And the story of buzzing the parasailor is simply horrifying -- if committed in the US it would be more than enough for a license suspension."
2,crass,"If you are looking for a real life story by a guy who has made really big bucks and spends them, this is it. If you want to read his good works, check out his two other novels."
3,"Although interesting to pilots, this book is disappointing.","I was really looking forward to this book, but it was not what I expected. I loved his previous books - so perfectly parrothead! But this one...unless you really get off on reading about a pilot and his love for airplanes (okay, and fishing too), this book is going to be sloooooow reading. Sorry, Jimmy...I expected more."
3,"interesting enough, but.................","this book was interesting enough if you want to know more about fishingthan Jimmy. Yes, I know he loves to fish, but I wanted a little morebackground."
4,actually liked it,"I was prepared to hate this book. If you have ever spent much time in Key West or even walked up and down Duval Street a few times, you become sick of Jimmy Buffett. It seems there is a Buffett song being played in every bar and there are three or four or more bars every block. However, I had read Tales From Margaritaville a while ago and seem to remember liking it. This is not the autobiography I thought it would be. Buffett comes across as likeable and not shallow. He can write and this book tells the reader more about him than anything else he has done. While still not a fan of his music, I recommend this book as well as Tales From Margaritaville."
4,It's Good To Be Jimmy,"As an longtime Buffett fan (dating back to the mid-1970s), I test drive everything Jimmy puts out, sometimes with great pleasure and sometimes with a little disappointment. A Pirate Looks At Fifty is an enjoyable read, especially while at the beach (or simply wishing you were). Buffett has lived 50+ years that most of us can envy, with a smile, and this book lets the reader vicariously participate. It's a bit heavy on seaplane and fly fishing technicalities, but full of great writing. Let's just hope Jimmy follows through on his hint that a forthcoming book will chronicle his early years in New Orleans."
4,Eye-opener for a Yuppie looking at 30.,"Buffett's book is not perfect or very ""literary"", but it sure was fun. It is perfect reading for the beach. More important, it is very revealing and thought-provoking for yuppies turning 30. Throw away your briefcases and live!"
5,Loved the book - wish I was there.,"I picked up this book because it looked like an exciting travel adventure story - I was right. I was never a big Buffet fan (Margaritaville is the only Buffet song I knew) but after reading this book I have become a Parrot Head in training. Jimmy seems like a well rounded, well read man who enjoys his life - what a pleasure to see.I didn't read this book too fast because I wanted to savor all of the experiences and adventures. I enjoyed the details - this made it more personal. I also loved his little bits of philosophy about life and kids and learning the background of some of his songs make me want to listen to them all.More, please."
3,Where did he find the time???,"... to do all this? If this all true, then I'm jealous of his life, and ashamed of mine! Between the office, home, little-league, homework, etc my life isn't as interesting as the copyright notice in this book."
4,Enjoying life and still confused- at 50,"Much wheat, little chaff. To be read in little bites. Much like a Jamaican meat pie, tasty but just barely filling. More to be read between the lines here than a list of facts- more of an analysis than a real clear statement. The feeling I get is that it is ok to have fun, ok to still be confused and maybe we all need a few more toys and time with kids to appreciate life. It is good to know that when I'm 50 I will still be as confused as I am today, and was 25 years ago. Just like Jimmy."
5,A pirate looks at fifty,"Takes me back to my own memories. Fantastic adventures, love reading about the time and places. Easy and fast reading, can't put it down at times."
2,Arrrggghhhh!!! Name Droppers R US!,"I absolutely LOVED ""Joe Merchant"" and ""Margaritaville"", so it was with baited breath and joyful anticipation, that I cracked open ""Pirate""...and began to read. That was MONTHS ago, and I'm STILL trying to get through it. Why Mr. Buffet has to resort to constant name dropping, people quoting and song quoting astounds me. Take all that away, and you'd have a book the size of a small magazine. Countless times I've had to stop myself from cursing out loud, and hurling the book across the room! Maybe I can finish by the New Year! Too bad. Stick to FICTION Jimmy...It is infinitely more entertaining!"
2,"For the first time, Jimmy has let me down!","I am a huge Buffett fan. I go to his concerts every year, I have read his other books, and one of his CD's usually isn't far away. However, this book was quite a let down. It is extremely slow and deals mainly with his vacation. We parrotheads want to hear stories about being on the road and interesting people he has met. There were too many boring stories that just didn't go anywhere."
1,A terrible book,"Simply put, this is garbage with a cover on it. Those who can finish it are to be praised, but certainly not this exploitation of a following. Sorry, Jimmy, you ripped us off on this one."
1,Not what you think it is.,"I bought this book to read ""at the beach"" thinking ""what could be more fun than Jimmy B?"" Well, War and Peace, maybe. Jimmy's accounts of air flight preparations, customs entries, and wave heights on the ocean did nothing for me. I really wanted to know what a 50 year old pirate/singer thinks about!!! Instead I found Jimmy to be a rich rock star who needs 10+ people to assist him in search of his youth. The book is at least 100 pages too long (mostly from his details of fishing and airplane guts). You know what? He made me glad to be almost 50 and NOT the manager of a musical empire in need of an escapist adventure. I still love his music, but won't ever think of him the same way. Buy his music, leave the book on the shelf!!!!"
1,Egomaniac tells all - poorly!,"He really *IS* a pirate! He ripped me off for about $20. Between naming off every one of his friends and acquaintances and showing us how worthless our pitiful, ordinary lives are, I was unable to find anything to like about the book. The least he could have done was share his ""Famous Dad Pancake"" recipe.I thoroughly enjoyed his other two books. They seemed to have been 'written'. This one left me feeling that he and his buddies sat around one night after a few beers sketching out ideas on bar napkins, then hastily 'assembled' the result before the buzz wore off. It has almost turned me into a _former_ parrothead.The only redeeming part of the book had to do with his relation with his father. I guess there really is a little humility wrapped in all that ego."
1,It bites,"Quick, someone grab the pen out of his hand! How can a person who's been so many interesting places and done so many fascinating things write a book that reads like your mother's grocery list. Who cares about where you bought every boat and plane you ever owned--tell us where you were when you wrote Let's Get Drunk and Screw! Seriously, it was a waste of my money."
1,"I can't STAND you ""parrotheads""","It makes me absolutely ill that Jimmy Buffet breathes the same air as me. What a dud! And how can you actually take a BOOK he's written seriously?! Find some decent music, find a good author, and go away!"
1,Self-absorbed and not worth the time or money...,"Actually I lied to amazon.com when I selected the ""Own the book"" box. I did own a copy but threw it away after reading 3/4 of the way through. I didn't want anyone else in my family to waste their time on this pulp fodder and I was embarrassed that I had spent money on it.In my youth I was a fan of Jimmy Buffett and thought that I would give this book a read. He himself let it be known early on that he wrote it to fulfill a book contract and then proceeded to amble along almost as if talking to himself. This reads more like a diary and diaries are for the writers, not the audience. That so many people would give this such a high rating (5 stars?!) shows that Hero Worship is alive and well in the US of A. If this is a 5, what are we to make of real writing?Oh, and YES, I did ""get it""."
5,What a crappy poster!,"Look at the crappy poster design for this outstanding movie. I just hate how Western versions of Asian films ruin the look and feel of a good movie. The poster makes it look like this movie is a love triangle of some sort or a cheap police crime story. If you can get a copy of the original DVD release in Hong Kong (3 movies in total), get those instead. The posters and covers are much better. They have removable English/Chinese subtitles as well. This is probably the best Hong Kong film of the last decade, so it's worth a shot if you're interested. There's great character development and interesting plot twists that will keep the audience intrigued until the last moments."
3,Its missing something,"I saw this movie about two weeks ago, when I first saw the movie The Departed when it hit theaters. That movie was Classic. I loved it. But then I heard about how it copied off an Asian movie called Infernal Affairs. So I had to watch that, too. Well, I rented it, and I have to say The Departed is much better. One reason is that I got very confused in some parts of this movie, some parts it seemed like something was missing. Or it didnt tell the story smoothly, something else was missing that was told better in The Departed. The Departed is an upgraded version of this movie, I didnt really enjoy the acting and the holes in the overall story of Infernal Affairs."
3,nice cover,"first of all, i have to say something about the cover of this DVD. the girl is never in the movie. but to attract buyer to buy this DVD, she is shown on the DVD cover. so we are having ""fake covers"" now. that's just fantastic.for the movie itself, it is about being undercovers, in the police and in the gangster world. they call it ""the eternal hell"" -- what the title ""infernal affairs"" means. well... big deal. we all choose our life and live with it. don't like it? we don't have to live like that. we have choices. no need to be an undercover and then complain that it is an ""eternal hell""."
2,Infernal Affairs,"If you are a martial arts fan like myself, and you expect to see martial arts action in this movie, you well be very disappointed. There is ZERO martial arts scenes in this movie. The plot of the movie is very good. There is a lot of suspense and drama as the moles from each side gang/cop attempt to uncover each other. Most of us in the States buy Hong Kong flicks for the EXCELLENT fight scenes, so I don't need to buy a Hong Kong flick for suspense and drama with no fight scenes. Movies like these are a dime a dozen in America. I think this movie is the exception and not the rule."
4,infernal affairs A+++,"this is a great movie, those familiar with the movie 'the departed' will deffinetly see where scorsese got his refferance from. the stories are similar to each other almost in every way. but i really enjoyed it alot. u wont be dissapointed."
3,Didn't change my life,"I expected, based on the reviews and critical rep, to like this more...while I was modestly entertained, I wasn't riveted to the screen, wasn't blown away - maybe there is a culture gap, but I just didn't get it. On the plus side, there are some great acting performances, particularly from the always excellent Mr. Leung.."
2,The subtitles are very poor,"This movie is very poorly subtitled, at least the version streamed by Amazon. Characters will talk for a minute and you'll get maybe three words of subtitles. Entire sentences are left out. I feel I missed half the movie."
5,Gripping crime thriller....,"This is the original smash-hit Hong Kong inspiration for ""The Departed""...only 50 times better. An absolute must see. Tony Leung is great in this and even the often stiff Andy Lau deserves some credit. Anthony Wong Chau-Sang and the always energetic Eric Tsang both take the cake for their superb acting.One thing that just irked me is the hot chick on the cover of the Miramax re-release of the DVD. That piece of arse is none other than Elva Hsiao (or Siu if you prefer Cantonese). She's a famous Taiwanese singer and *snicker ahem* ""actress"". Elva was in the movie for no more than a total of 5 minutes. Then why is she on the cover? Hey, sex sells. Slap a hot girl on the cover of anything and it'll sell. Only problem is, ""Infernal Affairs"" is an awesome movie that has nothing to do with sex and stands in its own right."
4,Like the movie - this is where the Departed was ripped off from.,"This is the original movie that Scorcese ripped off to make the Departed. If you liked that film, you should at least see this one."
4,Insteresting like The Departed,This movie is as interesting as the departed starring Matt Damon and DiCaprio however somewhere in the middle it got ambiguous
3,English Subtitles aren't Entirely Correct,"The disc itself plays fine, but the English subtitles for the movie aren't entirely correct. If you know even some Cantonese, then you will get irritate reading the subtitles. I.e, If someone is saying something like, ""Your mother made dinner already,"" the subtitle would say, ""The Thais are waiting"" or something like that (scene when Inspector Lau calls the Triad leader). And the subtitles will be like that for the entire movie. I would recommend turning off the subtitles (but if you need them and don't understand any Cantonese at all, then it will not bother you). Other than that, it's a great movie. I like it more than The Departed (the American adaptation)."
1,"Product nice, company difficult to work with","If you need to do anything other than order with this company, make sure and CALL them. I sent them an e-mail within three minutes of my order accidentally being submitted. I was informed, four days later when I called after receiving a notice my item was sent, that they ""don't have time to answer all their e-mails."" Clearly they don't even read them."
1,Not made well,"What a piece if garbage. The thing arrived with an important piece of plastic broken, which I tried to fix with Krazy Glue but didn't work. That aside, the antenna on the remote broke within hours of use, and the door to the battery compartment was a pain to remove. It was even difficult to get the batteries into the thing. In the short time we did get to fly it the removeable cockpit part kept popping off. Even if it came intact I wouldn't bet on this thing lasting more than a few flights before breaking. Don't waste your money, and I only hope I can get mine back."
3,An Introduction to a Fascinating Animal,"An introduction to an animal that children are often fascinated with, illustrated in Arnosky's wonderful style with lots of information about the characteristics, habits, and varieties of sharks. From a creationist perspective, this one is unfortunately marred with an explicit evolutionary reference saying sharks have swum in the oceans for millions of years, and they haven't changed much in all that time. A judicious parent with a sharpie can easily excise this comment, however, and the rest of the book is quite interesting and straightforwardly informative."
2,hmph,"another fans service diguised as something eits not. Basically like Ikki Tousen its basically a showcase of complicated and detahced plot,and busty hot chicks. at times i wish it was just about the chicks.The dialogue usual showcase of the flat and dull to the annoying and grating. While all the while laying out corny jokes thorughout.WEll i guess the creaters think they can mix fan service with big scaled nonsence action to keep us distcrated from the dead tired and over familair set up(even as a comdey it bores with old tired jokes).IT even says on the back of friggin cover in bold letters ""fan service""."
1,big boobs,"these girls have the biggest boobs. this show has absolutely no point other than fanservice. If you actually like the show you must be on crack. This is a mecha show,but they dont even need the mechas mizuki can battle them off with her boobs. this show is a piece crap and no one should buy it."
3,A very decent read.,"Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this book. But it is one I will not re-read very much (if ever). It is just a little lacking. But a good one time read."
5,Great Jazz,"I love this CD, it's classic jazz at its best. Favorite song has to be It Don't Mean a Thing but really the whole album is, well, lush. If you have a jazz loving friend this is a great gift."
5,Their name say's it all,"Great to hear there's still some honest alt-country, roots rocker's left out there. This group first caught my attention on the Fred Eaglesmith tribute disc, and this debut doesn't show any signs of them slowing down anytime soon. OFB play a fiery hillbilly, alt-country brand of music that's based in acoustic, but catches you with catchy electric lead guitar work that is punishing. They know how to write great songs too. These dudes, along with a group called Fortytwenty are the pride of a great label ""Slackjaw Records"" that deserves some attention. Check out their site, and you'll get a glimpse of two great new groups."
3,winner of the x.j. kennedy poetry prize,"I'm not sure how this book won the X.J. Kennedy Poetry Prize. The collection isn't uneven, I found most of the poetry to be bad or dull. There are two great poems in there: her prose poem ""The Wind"" and ""West of Tucson"" and I'd also say ""Irish Holiday"" is worth noting. This book is nothing like her latest, Brave Disguises, which is a phenomenal book. But I can see in this collection how she is developing the voice and poetics she now has. Be forewarned, there is little narritive or even much linear structure within this volume. The Surface of Last Scattering seems to be saying something, the problem is, I'm not quite sure what. Check out those three poems I mentioned, then just skip to Brave Disguises--you won't be disappointed there."
2,The Lame Picture Show,The best thing about this movie is Bo Hopkins as the sinister sheriff. He's reminiscent of a lankier Vic Morrow with a slow Sothern drawl. Other than Hopkins there's nothing else to recommend the film. Lackadaisical direction by Jack Starrett. By the numbers script. Unimpressive acting by anybody not named Bo Hopkins. Seen it before action and car chases. Perfect drive-in fare for those not interested in watching the movie. Except the scenes Bo Hopkins is in.
4,Interesting flick on the Texas landscape,"If you like movies in Texas, this one is for you. It has a similar theme to a fair number of 1970's movies: Payback. Pretty Susan George is very good, always seemingly ""caught in the middle"" - ever see Straw Dogs? Bo Hopkins is an excellent actor, particular in Sheriff roles. He has that aura about him - he has a Southern drawl, laid back, calm most of the time, but then he'll explode at any moment. Cool. Throw in some police chases and a murder, a shady Morgan Woodward, and there you have it. Must see for Hopkins fans."
3,Small Town in Texas,"I bought this because I am a John Karlen fan and there isn't a lot out there beyond Dark Shadows where he has much of a part. There are a few, but this isn't one of them. It's okay if you like car chases but if you are looking for Karlen, it doesn't offer much. I will say that when he is on screen, he doesn't disappoint. Bo Hopkins is fine and Susan George is good and the movie is okay if you're a Timothy Bottoms fan. The movie is typical of some movies in the Western U.S. with everyone wearing cowboy hats and everyone acting like they're still in 1865."
4,IDAHOMAN,I thought this book was very informative and well written. This is the perfect book for a first time sailboat buyer. For the first time sailor it is easy to read and understand. I would recommend this book to all the new sailors out there who are anxious to hit the water.
2,Jade Drop Earrings,"I wasn't expecting a lot from these earrings, and although they are generally what I wanted (to replace stolen ones) the quality of the jade was not good. The jade was much darker than shown in the photo and had darker streaks besides. However, the price was very good. I'm sure I saved at least $100."
2,To advanced for the instructor on the dvd,"Namaste........Normally I would never do this and I feel bad writing it, but I have been parcticing yoga for almost 10 years now and this dvd is by far one of the worst I have worked with. I got it because I love Hawaii and the instructor is Hawaiian. The dvd is definitely not a beginner one, however it is too adavnced for the guy teaching it. He has a hard time getting into some of the poses and his transitions from one to the next are also not the best. For the price I paid ($25 with shipping) I was expecting a video of much higher quality. The voice over does not match the mouth movements and the music is just plain distracting. If you already have other dvds I would say get this one for something different but if you are just learning yoga defiently look for another video......sorry again to the guy who made the video"
3,Award Winning Movie Themes of the 80s,"After having collected Awards Winning Movie Themes of the 50s, 60s, and 70s, this CD is somewhat of a letdown. It was nice to hear the familiar melodies of that era, but somehow, the music is not quite as engaging as in the previous CDs. The quality of the music production was ploddingly adequate, no more and no less."
5,Great Moisturizer,"The product is a very nice moisturizing lotin. The ingredient ""squalane"" was reccommended to me by my dermatologist. Try it, you'll like it."
2,disspointing.,"i am very disappointing with this lotion. I have relatively dry skin, but The fat cream did not give skin the rich and soft touch, it's hart to absorb. Do not recommend this item."
1,Piece of no good stuff,"This is the worse eletronic product I have ever had. The CD player makes a sound like it is about to take of. I had to send to repair. After 6 months of use, it started to make the same sound. It also does not play any ""old"" DVD. It has to be a perfect CD and DVD, very clean no scratches, the it will play it. It is not programable.The Radio is hard to program. Not easy to follow with remote control.The tape player eats all my precious old tapes. Already lost one, very rare tape. One of our treasures. It had a value of US$150.00. More expensive that this player. It is only a year old and I wish I could get some money back for it. I can't even give it away because is so bad."
1,badly designed CD player,after a couple of months the CD player went belly up -the CDs are held by a plug with 3 spring loaded tapered tension plugs and it comes off ruining the CD.Definitely badly designed.Expected a better product from Philips regardless where it is made (China)
5,Dr. Bonner Trys to Spread The Truth,"Dr. Michael Bonner is the only medical author I know of who emphasizes the seriousness of dental and gum disease, and its impact on cardiac health. Though others have written about the topic, Dr. Bonner sounds the alarm, and gives the reader a protocol which can reverse oral disease, and promote a return to vital health.What I learned about the impact of C-reactive protein (Crp),and the tests he tells you to take to identify it, and the steps you need to take (how to keep your gums and mouth healthy)to lower it have been potentially life-saving for me. Clearly written and well organized, I rate it 5 stars."
5,oral health home run,"This is an interesting, fun to read, and very important work for anyone and everyone interested in a holistic approach to improve their health. It caused me to reflect on the many patients whom I have cared for as an Internist over the past twenty years, and to lend thought with regard to the state of their oral health and its relationship to their overall health. To say the least, the advice is straightforward, safe, and easy to follow, and Dr Bonner has apparently taken the creed ""First Do No Harm"" seriously as he dispenses his logical formularies and advice. I am recommending this book to my patients without hesitation."
4,Great,"I like hip huggers best and this comes a little higher on the waist which is why I did not give 5 stars. However, it is a great fitting product, light weight and I would recommend it."
4,The Only Ones,"These have been my favorite and only panties for many years; they fit perfectly without binding, chafing or rolling, but are still attractive. I hope they are never discontinued."
1,afscott76,"4/13/07 Product used to come from Vietnam (or may still?) but this batch came from Honduras -totally different product, different color, different material. So money spent for nothing. I will have to look harder in order to get the Vietnam manufacturer's product. Oh, also, the Vietnam manufacture says Size 7 but the Honduras Size 7 is really Size 8 --a whole inch larger around the waist!"
1,beware ordering from herroom,"i have worn olga scoop underwear for 20 years. i will keep buying them. however, when i bought 9 pair last november from herroom, i noticed over the months that the little elastic strings were coming out of the underwear, short ones and long ones. they get all tangled up in the wash. in short, they are falling apart. i contacted herroom customer service and they told me that they would not be able to exchange as their policy is that the product must be unworn and unused and within 30 days. i wonder how one is supposed to find out that they are defective without washing and wearing them. so keep buying these underwear, but don't buy from herroom"
5,Good product.,This is a good product. It is true to size and seems to be of good quality.It arrived in a timely fashion and I was pleased with it.
5,Perfect Panties,I have been searching for these panties and was so glad to find them on Amazon. After reading the reviews about them being made out of a differnt fabric I was affraid to order them. I just ordered a few pairs to see what everyone is talking about on these reviews. Their crazy!!! These are the exact same panties as I have been ordering for years.Stock up while they are still available!So happy that Amazon carries these. Im ordering a bunch more.
2,Runs large,"Very pretty. Ordered my normal size, but this product runs big. Very little elastic in the lace and creeps as you wear it."
5,Olga Scoops are difficult to find,"I was pleased with the product and the speed of delivery. I believe the lack of colors was because the item is being phased out. My derriere is a five , so I misguaged the size (6). Rats!"
5,The best undies!,I've been wearing this style of undies for years. They are the most comfortable I've found. They never ride up giving wedgies and they cover to just about an inch below the belly button. Love them!
2,Know Everything Before You Buy This,"Be sure you understand all the elementary calculus principles backwards and forwards, all the properities of logs and natural logarithms, all the trigometric identies and properties, differential equations, and have a strong math background. This book lacks explaination. It statements are very broad and followed by very few select examples that are partially worked out. Be sure to understand the vocabulary of mathmatics. I found the concepts of advanced calculus rather easy but the way the books expresses the material makes the course first appear impossible. Each problem should take no longer than 10 minutes tops. Some students in the class spent hours for several nights in a row working 1 or 2 problems. This is a waste of time."
1,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed. Arrived only 1 pair. Where is my last 11?And another problem is that, sticks are not good quality."
5,"So many insights on ""things being"", you have to take notes","Jeremy Campbell performs an absolutely brilliant work, linking and polishing all the important concepts about every level of the universe, in such a way that even when they are the most arcane and ""for-initiated-only"" in their respective fields, they become crystal clear and ebulliently alive through the pages. I actually HAD to take notes carefully quoting him, in order to preserve the understanding and the wonder conveyed by the exact writing. An invaluable piece on the uniqueness of information that is a truly unique piece of the richest information itself. A book to be read many times, especially good if you are a scientist battling with specific facts every day and would appreciate to refresh your perspective of what is the universe all about."
4,great read.,"This book is a study of Intensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP), the author was a student of its originator Dr. Davanloo.I read this book as a follow up to Dr. Davanloo's original work and found this helped to solidify the core concepts of ISTDP.Its a fascinating subject and one that this author outlines very well with multiple case studies, well worth the read.J"
3,Intensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy:Theory and Technique Synopsis,Item being reviewedIntensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy: Theory and Technique SynopsisThis book is very interesting. I recommend.
3,"well researched, but emotionally flat","The best thing about this book is the research involved. Maxwell did a great job adding lots of little details that give the book a fine edge.The plot was fair. Some plot holes and some other nice twists so it was overall a mixed bag.However, the romance was just blah to me. I've dated an ex-military man with the scars to prove it and Shane Crowe was a pale imitation of the real thing. Throughout the whole book, I kept thinking of people I have known in real life and how flat these fictional characters seemed.Although there are well written short erotic scenes, I just couldn't get into this book at an emotional level because I didn't believe in the characters.As a fan of Maxwell's unfinished pulp science-fiction/fantasy series ""Fire Dancer"", I hope I can find more of her books that resonate with me. This one wasn't it."
4,"Good, but a reprint","For new Maxwell readers, this will be a treat. For other Maxwell readers, be aware that this is a reprint of an earlier publication date."
5,Simply Among the Best,"Right up there with ""Man on Wire,"" ""Pixar Story,"" and ""The Boys."" An inspiring, feel-good story about how the world's biggest underdog overcame odds to become the world's biggest media empire."
5,An Excellent Documentary - a Must See,This picture is both charming and profound. The documentary perfectly shows how it is that a group of talented people can come together and create something wonderful and inspiring - and then how they can destroy it through ego and selfishness. The whole thing was very Shakespearean to me - and the honesty and insight with which the inside story is revealed is unheard of in Hollywood. This is not a fluff piece. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in how Hollywood or any business involving creativity works - or doesn't work. I've seen it twice and I was moved and enlightened both times.
3,Old-Fashioned Nostalgia,"Any Disney fan should see this documentary.It's impressive because it manages to tell the story of what was going on without bells and whistles, or any of the fanfare that usually gets thrown along with any Disney-flashback sort of film or featurette. They didn't shy away from the realities that have been very-well hidden up until now. The fact that Don Hahn was able to do this really impressed me because I didn't think the Disney company would let him get away with it.It's not the best thing ever made, but it's very enlightening and very humanizing."
4,Great Info,"The footage is pretty old and some looks like it came off a VHS, but it has some great information about the history of Disney. They touch on Pixar but only briefly. I love animation, Pixar and Disney and this was fun to watch."
3,Viewing Disney History,"Having a interest in all things Disney, I was looking foward to viewing this latest video concerning Disney's History. Although the video includes many never before seen events and meetings, I was somewhat disappointed in it's style. Basically you have two employees of the Disney studio using their personal video cameras to record a typical day at the studio during the Michael Eisner period. They record areas of the studio rarely seen, but also repeat footage of the same areas only at different dates in time. The overall video is informative, but lacks the usual Disney style. I guess I was expecting something put together by the studio, but instead received a video of behind the scene footage put together by two employees!"
2,I guessed I would love it. I sure was wrong!,If you want to watch a fun disney documentary--- Watch the Boys.I had a hard time maintaining interest.Walking Sleeping Beauty almost put me to sleep.
4,"Good, would have been better if not done by Disney","I enjoy the Disney-produced docs about Disney, includingThe Boys: The Sherman Brothers' StoryandWalt & El Grupo. This one is no different. However, as documentaries they would be so much better if an objective source produced them. This one, though, is probably the best of the best. It confronts its issues pretty well, and brings its topic to life."
4,Left out a couple things...,"I love documentaries but I honestly had no idea if this one would be worth me watching or not since there are only a few disney animated movies I actually really like. Well, I did end up really liking this film, I thought it was really fascinating as well as entertaining. I just wish it would have gone back even further into the earlier years and hadn't been cut off at the Lion King and would have gone into the other animated films up to whenever they made the documentary (2007 I think). The only negative thing is I was waiting for them to address a couple of the ""rumors"" and subliminal things that some of the animators supposedly got fired for but they never did mention them...such as the person that drew the penis on the castle on the original Little Mermaid VHS cover or supposedly writing the word sex in the sand in Lion king that they tried to later say stood for special effects. Oh well, it was still worth a watch for any artists and people who enjoy disney films."
3,Aled,"I just wanted the song that is sung in Emma (the one with Gwenith Paltrow-really liked the movie with her in it), ""Do you not see my lady?"" I love the melody."
5,Great Iowa History Book,I bought this book after my older brother told me about it being his sixth grade textbook for history (he graduated in '77). Not only did it help me to learn more about stuff I thought I knew but also learned about stuff I should have known. Wish I had been interested in history as kid but such is the way of most people. A great read for Iowans!
5,Classic TV Show now a Classic Movie!,"Very entertaining blast from the past! The movie definitely has a different feel than the original show but it also adds some great elements that probably would have been censored back in the 70s. If you are a fan of the tv show, this is a must see!"
3,John Barnicle of Dummy told me this was his favorite Ben Stiller movie,"I was talking with the members of Chicago punk rock trio Dummy after a show, and their guitarist John Barnicle kept butting in talking about this movie. He said it was his favorite Ben Stiller movie and to ""just wait till you see their outfits"". Anyway I watched it and it was fine. I mean the outfits were kind of funny, but nothing you don't see in the trailer."
2,Dumb,"This is a stupid remake of Starsky and Huth I thought it was going to be good but it is not.It looks fake just terrible 70s stuff I did not get it,and it was not enjoyable at allActing 4/10 Direction 1/10 Action 3/10 Story 2/10 Entertainment2Total=2.5 out of 10 Fingers"
2,Very Boring!,"I rented this movie recently and I was told it was an action/comedy. If you ask me, it is more of a drama/action. It is not really a comedy. I got very bored during this movie. If you are into dramas and actions you'd like it. But for me, it was a waste of time and money."
3,"In the right mood, I laughed out loud","This movie stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as Starsky and Hutch, undercover police detectives in ""Bay City"". They learn to get along and break a cocaine ring headed by Vince Vaughn character with the aid of ""Huggy Bear"" played by Snoop Dog. I must say, I'm a bit snooty about movies, and this movie was pretty stupid, but it made me laugh out loud. Not many movies do that. Recommended."
1,Simply horrible.,"I cannot find words to describe how disappointing this movie was. To make Hutch corrupt was a mistake, and to make Starsky such a geek was ridiculous. It was Ben Stiller, not David Starsky's character we were all watching. And Ben Stiller has only one character. Yes, he's a funny guy, but he is one-dimensional, at least in the movies I've seen.Three sittings it took us to just get through the movie without falling asleep on a certain part. Ugh. I hope hollywood does a better job with The Dukes of Hazzard!Spoofs are fine, but this one was really not what America wanted to see. They are making these ""remakes"" of TV shows into movies so that they are ALL spoofs and poke ridiculous fun at shows that many of us grew up with and loved."
3,Fair,"I have not seen the original Starsky and Hutch series, and the movie doesn't peek my interests. The movie was funny (at the expense of half-brained situations), Snoop should not be Huggy Bear, and Huggy's overintelligent bodyguards weren't too funny either. I watched the movie twice, but it didn't grow on me. This is a pure rental, but if you could borrow it from a sap that bought it, you would be in an even better place."
3,Not funny (but should have been),"I was excited to see this movie when I saw the previews, but I was disappointed. I used to love Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, but I've tired of their stagnant comedic performances - they always play the same characater! And Stiller is so mechanical and angry these days, it's unnerving to watch."
4,Nostalgic fun,"Todd Phillips take on the classic television series is a retro nostalgic look at the style and fun of the 70's. Ben Stiller does a funny and classy job as Starsky and Owen Wilson is great as Hutch. Their chemistry makes this movie as fun as it is with their great timing and fun outlook at the material they have. They were great together in zoolander, and they tear it up again in this film. Snoop Dogg is great as Huggy Bear and does steal the movie a little with his performance, and Vince Vaughn is great as the typical retro 70's villain with mustache in tow. The Direction by Todd Phillips stays in line with the flashy style that made that bygone time such a memorable one, and the look of the film stays with the tone that was the bench mark of the series. Look for Will Ferrel to make guest appearance in this movie as a prison inmate, and look for Carmen Electra as a cheerleader who falls in love with the guys."
2,"Yup, just not that funny.","Worth a chuckle if on TV late at night, but that's about it. Not a huge let down, but you expect more. Just not ""zany"" as it wants to be. The DVD extras are fairly lame as well, as most DVD supplements are becoming. If you really want it... buy it used from some rental outlet."
3,Good enough but....,"Not as good as it should have been. I've been anticipating this one for some time (and I'm sure it went through many incarnations before it came to be what it is at the moment). In any case I'm happy that it came out the way it did. Still... there's been a lot of films playing off the 70s of late and I thought that this film took a lot of easy jokes that I've seen before in films that we're frankly much better (check out ""undercover Brother"" and the much overlooked independent release ""Shafted!"" that seemed to predate much of the current wave of 1970s nostalgia). In any case, a good effort and I hope they make a sequel that takes it up a notch."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE EVER,STARSKY AND HUTCH IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. LOL FUNNY.I THINK IT WAS COLL TO HAVE SNOOP DOG PLAY HUGGY BEAR.I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE 5 STARS BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD MOVIE FOR ANY BODY.(BUY THIS MOVIE)
2,eh...,"It has its moments. Problem is, they are kind of few and far between. This movie is right along the same lines as something like Joe Dirt - it's something to watch when you have nothing else to watch. Also, the retro 70's thing is getting a little old."
3,Predictable laughs,"I enjoyed Stiller and Wilson's sendup of the fashion industry, ""Zoolander"", so I was ready to go see this one the weekend it opened. The movie turned out to be a pleasant diversion. The laughs were very predictable, which made the movie seem much longer than it was. The real jewels in the crown for this movie were Snoop Dogg's karmic turn as Huggy Bear and the appearance of the genuine Starsky and Hutch team in the last frame. I recommend you see this movie, but wait until it comes out on DVD or VHS and rent it instead."
5,GREAT GREAT MOVIE,I think Stiller and Wilson did a great job protraying the old show Starsky and Hutch. I just can't wait until the next one comes out. Go and see this movie if you have not already done so. It is funny and has action in it what more do you want. I think that this was is one of the best cop movie out at the moment. I think we all needed a movie like this so we can laugh at what we use to watch when we were kids. I really recommend this movie to anybody.
4,Not Too Bad!,"I have to admit, I was not expecting much from this movie. My expectations were pretty low, but what I got was a much better film then I expected. While it dosn't capture the feel of the original series, the movie is still entertaining.Alot of the movie is standard and mediocre cop comedy and satire, but there are choice moments that stand out, mostly due to Ben Stiller hijinks and Owen Wilson reaction. Huggy Bear's character, played by Snoop Dogg, serves as the typical minority character relief, but even so, Snoop Dogg comes off as very humourous.Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson may not be a convincible Starsky and Hutch, but they indeed do serve as an entertaining time to spend an extra 2 hours."
2,Boring,"From the reviews and recommendations from friends, this movie looked pretty funny. Apparently, my friends are mush more easily amused than I am.This movie sucks, hands down. It is boring, slow, and lacks action. There were several funny parts, coming only from Owen Wilson. He is a funny guy. I think that Ben Stiller is annoying.I rented this movie and found myself turning it off after about 45 minutes, from sheer boredom. I rarely ever do this during a movie.So, just don't buy it or see it. A complete waste of time.-Davis"
2,"Two and a half, really.","This movie has some charm. Not much, but enough. Enough to make it a pleasant ride. The whole thing starts off slowly, though. I was ready to give up after the first twenty minutes. But give it a chance.The plusses? It keeps the corn to a minimum, there's a nice rapport between Stiiller and Wilson (although they were much better in Zoolander), and the script eventually becomes whimsical enough to be engaging. There's also a nice cameo by Will Ferrell.I guess one question needs to be raised. What the heck happened to Juliette Lewis? She's reduced to a pathetic role without even so much as a couple of decent lines. One would think that an actress who had such a fast start in Hollywood would retire before taking on a role like this. But, I suppose the money was good and maybe she has a big mortgage payment."
3,It was alright,"The movie was boring in the beginning, then it started getting funny in the middle to the end of it.Snoop! Stick to rapping, this has got to be the worst acting ever made from the Doggfather. What's with the golf clothes?Next thing you'll hear his latest album called Snoop Golfy Dogg and latest single, ""Ima Give Ya A Hole In One b33ach!""Sorry pony lovers, you don't want to watch this movie, if you can't stand a pony getting blasted by a bunch of bullets.Props to Owen Wilson! You da man! Carmen Electra and that one blonde chick from Roadtrip-You should've made it to be Paris Hilton & Carmen instead.Overall, it will leave with you a few laughs."
1,Don't waste your money,"This movie was very stupid. It was a waste of my time and money. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but in a half full theatre, I didn't hear anyone laugh once for the whole movie. Sometimes really bad movies have good soundtracks, but the soundtrack for this wasn't even all that great. The best part of the movie was when it was over.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! You'll thank me!"
2,Terrible....,I thought this movie was awful. The humor seemed weak to me. I like Ben Stiller; but was disappointed. The plot bored me. It was way too simple.
3,More fun that it has a right to be,"Starsky and Hutch is more fun than it has any right to be, even if it does depart from the series in many ways. Stiller has Paul Michael Glaser's mannerisms down to a tee (he even has Glaser's bizarre run, like a hyperactive duck doing a windmill impersonation, down to perfection) but otherwise is another of his trademark anal neurotics while Owen Wilson takes Hutch even further away as a laid back dude not above a spot of robbery to supplement his salary. But it is funny, good natured and doesn't outstay its welcome too much. The only real bum note is giving the final glory to Snoop's terrible Huggy Bear, a charmless, boring and lazy performance constantly outshone by his own bodyguards."
4,Bacardi and Cola-Do It!,"Hysterically funny, and you might feel dumber after you watch it, but it is a classic!"
2,"OK Movie, but it sure ain't the Original S&H....","This fairly amusing spoof, homage, whatever you want to call it, was an ok movie, but nothing special. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or an action drama, and ended up being not much of either. It doesn't hold a candle to the original series at all, nor to the original stars. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, while likeable, can't possibly begin to match the chemistry of their original counterparts. It's like comparing classic Coke with new Coke- change the formula, and it just ain't the same. The best part of the film was when Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul finally show up at the end- what a nice treat to see them with the Torino. It makes me wish they were the stars of this movie. It's a shame the movie execs did not go that route. Still, it's worth seeing if you're a fan of the show or just plain curious. Just don't expect too much."
3,"kind of stellar, could have done without Snoop Dogg.","why is it that every time a movie is put out, a rapper or a pop trash star has to be in it? rap is not my favorite kind of music, and I almost fell asleep watching this. besides Snoop Dogg, Ben Stiller was acting. Ben Stiller can't act to save his life. Ben Affleck should have played the part of Starsky. I commend Owen Wilson for his acting ability though. Owen was in the movie ""Armageddon"",so the part of Starsky should have been played by Affleck, or even Adam Sandler, or even Jim Carrey."
2,VERY DISAPOINTING,I RENTED THIS MOVIE WITH GREAT HOPE THAT IT WOULD HAVE ME LAUGHING THE WAY OLD SCHOOL DID. IT FELL WAY WAY SHORT. VINCE VAUGHN WHO IS SO FUNNY TO ME WAS NOT FUNNY. ANY MOVIE THAT CAN MAKE WILL FERRELL BORING IS A TOTAL DISASTER. OWEN WILSON TO ME WAS A SURPRISE AND WAS GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. BEING THAT IM NOT A FAN OF BEN STILLER I WONT EVEN COMMENT ON HIM. THIS WAS JUST A BORING MOVIE TO ME AND WAS A TOATAL LET DOWN. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I WERE YOU
3,The Real Starsky and Hutch,"The movie failed to deliver the friendship and loyalty the original TV series of Starsky and Hutch gave us. The series was the first to deal with homosexuality, drug addiction, rape, child abuse, etc. The real Starsky and Hutch -- David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser -- brought their real-life friendship to the screen. And they're going to show it off again on March 23 in Los Angeles for a special in-person event. For more information, visit sur con 2013 and leave out the spaces between those three words. Then add a dot before the com and away you'll go! Come see the boys in person."
2,not worth watching,"After watching about 5 minutes of this movie, I cut it short as we found it not to be the least entertaining"
3,lame,"I can't believe anyone liked this movie. It was boring. It wasn't funny at all. It was everything bad that I don't feel like typing.The only good part was a scene near the end where the car... I won't spoil it. It's not like I have a problem with the actors. I just had a problem with the lack of an interesting plot and the absense of humor. What was passed off as humor did nothing for me. Hey, maybe it's me. I have the problem, I guess."
4,Wild wacky adventure in the '60's,"Having never seen the original Starsky and Hutch shows I was absolutely clueless on how these two men worked in their relationship. Starsky played by Owen Wilson is definatly in a turnaround in this role, as he usually plays the rather clueless and brainless man of the hour. Point in case I Spy and the shangia noon/knight series.Ben Stiller is as always Ben Stiller, no more, no less. The movie is a crackup, there is just no two ways about it. Snoop Dogg is an interesting character, although I was a bit on the clueless side about his role. It think they needed to explain what he was just a little bit better. fashion statement or detective. Or both. I'm not sure.One of the best parts of the film is where Starsky and Hutch break into the enemy's territory by playing Mime's. Wherewith the mimeless Starsky tells the crowd that he'll do the climbing wall motion one more time. Watch it, you'll see what I mean."
2,Had to give it less than 3 stars...,"Even though I found this movie enjoyable and had no real ""beef"" with the story line, acting, soundtrack, etc. What I had a problem with is that I rented this movie thinking that I'd get a bunch of laughes out of it and that it would be a comedy like some of Stiller's and Wilson's other movies like two of my favorites, zoolander and meet the parents. That is probably the only reason to not really like this movie. Considering that it really isn't funny at all with a comedic cast that would leave you to believe it would be I had to give it less than 3 stars."
4,"Quite enjoyable, but not the duo's best","Another stellar performance by Ben Stiller as he plays the likeable, but always in the wrong place Starsky. Owen Wilson plays another one of his typical roles and plays it well as the laid back, sarcastic, dumb blonde Hutch.If you are in the mood for an easy to follow feel good movie with some great laughs, then this is the movie for you. The general plot is that Starsky(Ben) and Hutch(Owen) get caught in trying to catch a kingpin while encountering Will Ferral(A homosexual dragon-lover) and Vince Vaughn(A drug Lord)."
2,The Trailer for the movie was the BEST PARTS,"I couldn't wait to see this film after seeing the Trailer,but to be honest,this movie was a real let down,and I love Stiller and Wilson working together in so many funny films ,but ""Starky and Hutch isn't one of them."
3,Sweet Emotion,"Good film. Good acting. Limited story especially since I have no clue what Starsky & Hutch was all about. In any case, watch this film if they're showing it on television or rent it. Do not buy because it's not really one of those films you buy. Some scenes were funny and it is just the perfect movie for the ""three star"" grade. Cheers.Want a 5 star comedy film? Watch Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle."
4,Funny Funny Funny,"I never watched any of the original Starsky & Hutch, but being a fan of Todd Phillips, Vince Vaughn, and Ben Stiller I loved this movie. Snoop does a great job playing Huggy Bear. If you want to laugh and be entertained then you should get this movie."
4,"If you like cop shows, the 70's, Ben Stiller, or Owen Wilson","...this is for you. I personally like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The movie is entertaining, although not quite full of laughs. There is some action, a dance-off and some car stunts. This is a good way to spend a few dollars and hours, but I wouldn't go as far as buy it."
2,Stiller/Wilson Chemistry is It,"This is somewhat forgettable a film. Only the antics and vibe between Stiller and Wilson save it. Snoop is Snoop. And the car is cool. But the two of them make this, after all why else was it made(?), and thats it.The extra features on the DVD are pretty dull, a few wisely deleted scenes(-though one features an amazing butt), some mockumentary about how everyone hated making the film(-this gets old very quickly), outtakes of Stiller and Wilson and the rest stopping takes because of laughing(-reinforcing the uselessness of such features) and a short Snoop segment featuring him in his various 70's Huggy costumes.Rent this, don't buy it."
2,Movie Forgotten About Very Quickly,"I watched this movie, with the intention of a good laugh and seeing some very cool 70's action.I was very dissapointed with it. I could count the funny incidents on one hand and I think I had to wake up my wife when it was over.It does have it moment's, but will certainly not go down as a classic - not that the movie should be avoided at all costs, as it is not quite a Battlefield Earth type of bordem but I would hire the movie to watch rather than buy it...I don't think it would get to many multple viewings....."
1,BEN STILLER THE DORK!,"Why is it almost every movie Ben Stiller the dork is in sucks?He's so corny! If I could put my hands through my t.v. set, I'dechoke him! This movie had a couple of funny moments, but nothingworth remembering. (Ben)-dover, please don't make anymore movies!"
1,Could have been great...,"I was 13 years old when the series originated and have seen every episode several times. I have purchased seasons 1 and 2 on dvd from Amazon and was at first concerned that the show would not be quite as enjoyable as I remembered. The fact is that viewing these episodes after all this time I find that the original series was really great and that Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, Antonio Fargas as well, not only acted well but that the action was top notch. Which brings me to this movie. I like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, both very talented guys. This could have been great instead it was full of low end cheap dialogue and situations. It has absolutey nothing to do with the original series regarding wit, character or integrity. It shows these chacters as bafoons. Hey I enjoy senseless bad taste as much as the next guy but it has to be at least funny. Don't waste your time with this movie, watch the original series."
1,If you're going to do something -- do it right.,"I'm not a purist who can't abide a satire of a classic TV show -- I loved the irreverent Brady Bunch movies -- but I found little to laugh at in this lame outing.The Brady Bunch movies were funny because they captured the essence of the show and then infused the satire. This movie captures the look and feel of the 70s, but Stiller and Wilson are NOT playing Starsky and Hutch. They are playing Stiller and Wilson in Starsky and Hutch clothing.Starsky was not an uptight, humorless stiff as played by Stiller and Hutch was not a crooked, bribe-taking cop as played by Wilson!I'm not an indignant fan who says ""How dare they!"" Just a fan of the old show -- I was a high school girl during its intial run and their posters adorned my bedroom wall -- who feels that if you're going to parody S&H;, get it right and don't simply use the premise as a vehicle for Stiller and Wilson's familiar schtick.Not recommended."
2,SOMETHING BEYOND THE RETRO FASHION FEST WOULD'VE BEEN NICE!,"More of a costume party than a real film, with more 70s references than plot points, Starky & Hutch is mostly about Stiller and Wilson playing dress-up, jiving with each other and making countless 'insider' jokes about the mod/pop culture of 30 years ago.And when they run out of ways to make fun of afros and other sundry items of retro fashion, they resort to leering at bimbos (enter Carmen Electra and Amy Dumb), making what starts out as just harmless junk into callow, obvious junk.Most of the 'jokes' seem targeted at the 13-18 year-old male demographic. On a humorous scale of 1 to 10, it scores a magnanimous 0.5 -- idiotic and disturbingly reliant on a conversance and affection for a television show that most of us remember as being about a red Grand Torino if we remember it at all.Two stars for the occasional funny moment that sneaked in."
5,fine book,"This book is a fine instruction on the Catholic faith. It would be much greater coming from a priest rather than a book. I have yet to find such a priest, it's left to the laity."
1,"Great Film, Lousy DVD. Inexcusable.","The film is quite good, I'd say 4 stars. Not Barbara Steele's or Antonio Margheriti's best (that's probably Black Sunday/Castle of Blood), but a very good, enjoyable film.But this DVD is really lame. For more, see the other review here, but suffice it to say, these guys obviously encoded an old worn-out VHS tape with bad audio built-in and acted like it's a serious DVD. No, it's terrible. I guess if it's the only way to see the movie it's worth a rent on bargain day, but otherwise forget it, and avoid releases by this company. Even worse than Alpha video. (I never thought I'd ever be saying that!)"
2,Only Buy This Used,"The company who released this is charging way too much for it. If it was a cheapie $7.99 (or whatever) DVD then I wouldn't complain. I love budget DVDs ( thank you Alpha Video! ) but, the list price of this release is insulting. VERY poor quality transfer, VERY. Its a shame too, Long Hair of Death is a great flick. Cool period setting, good production design, engaging story, spooky, its my favorite Barbara Steele movie. If you've never seen it before and are desparate then buy it used or on sale. Shame on you Eclectic DVD Distribution!.......ya jerks."
2,I wish they would offer Sunset Ride Album for sale on CD!!!,"I had an album by (LP)Zypher that I gave away as a gift (after I recorded it on my reel-to-reel) The album cover had a cartoon type airplane flying into a south pacific type sunset. I believe the album lable was Warner Bros. and the title was ""Sunset Ride"". It was one of the best (female vocal) blues albums I have ever heard. It there anybody out there who knows of this album. Maybe it was just a dream!!Jeff"
1,Another request for Sunset Ride,"Unfortunately, the best Zephyr album, and one of the best of ALL albums, in my humble opinion, is Sunset Ride, and is yet to be released on CD. A roomate of mine in 1973-4 in San Francisco let me have her copy when our house broke up, and I've played it to death, warped and all. Please, music gods, let's have it soon..."
3,"Latin Lovers, Latin Others","Here is a noble attempt at inscribing a Latino presence within the trendy ""love"" anthologies making a belated (but welcomed) splash in the gay writing market, yet this collection offered a dangerous view of the Latino male as object (not subject) of desire. Still it is important in that it fuels the dialogue about how the gay Latino serves as agent for the non-Latino author's fantasies. This is a must for any queer studies curriculum that analyzes how race and gender connect, and how the Latino body continues to be exoticized even by marginalized literature. An interesting read."
2,Double dissapointment,"I had a lot of illusion on buying this movie for my self. I saw It before purchasing it from Amazon, however I experienced a DOUBLE DISSAPOINTMENT1- This DVD does not provide options for other languajes, at least subtitles. I need it with Spanish subtitles like the one I saw before purchasing2- The DVD was either broken or it broke the very first attempt to release it from the case. I certainly know that one needs to push the center buttom of the case to release de dvd. I did and yet I came broke out of the case.This is the very first dvd (and probably last) that I purchases from amazon..."
1,The Secret,The DVD is non-functional. It worked once and no longer works. I am arranging for an exchange. I will rate your service on several blogs.
2,This is just silly,"This is just silly.While of course I do understand that like attracts like, that is just the beginning. Creation is more complex than that. There are 3 components of creation in this world that we live in. Thought word and action. Thought is the beginning which should lead to word which is more concrete and more powerful than thought, which leads to action which is then more concrete and powerful in this world than either thought or word.If you have (clarity, intensity, duration) of (thought, word, action) in this world you create. That is the formula. That is how you become a powerful creator in this physical world of time and space.Unfortunately this program takes just one piece of that formula and expands it as if it was the entire universe. Hogwash. This program claims that clarity of thought is the whole answer. Well it just does not work that way.Good start, woefully inadequate.BTW - great marketing!"
1,unsatisfactory product,"I am very upset by the quality of the DVD ""The Secret"" as it is not not working and contacted the company and they are least concerned about their coustomer service."
1,Money Machine,"I received this unsolicited email today:""Unlock the Secret to the Healing CodesLearn how altering your subconscious mind, your misconceptions and your beliefs can dramatically improve your health and change your life.""Dr. Ben Johnson, one of the teachers of ""The Secret"" will guide you through the missing piece of ""The Law of Attraction"" that was not shared in ""The Secret.""Unless someone is illegally using Dr. Ben Johnson's name, this ad says it all. Why would anyone participate in the making of a dvd purporting to tell you ""the secret"" and then send out an email telling you that they didn't tell you the REAL secret in the last thing they sold you and that the REAL secret can only be found through purchasing more of the author's materials?Enough said."
2,Lacking,"I saw this movie and while I dont dispute the role of positive thinking, I feel as if the movie prays on peoples insecurities. I found it very disturbing that it focused so much on people's attraction to wealth and money. While touching very little on true spirituality.This is a movie for anyone who is not willing to actually take the time to read anything about true spirituality. Anyone who really wants to learn ""The Secret"" is better off reading any number of books and authors like1. The New Testament.2. Any book by Thich Nhat Han.3. Any Book by Mother Teresa4. The Gospel of Thomas5. Any Book by Father Anthony DeMello6. The Tao Te Ching7. The 7 Spiritual Laws of success8. The 4 Agreements9. The Art of Peace10. There's a Spiritual Solution to any problem.To name only but a few.If its such a wonderful secret why do they charge so much ?It seems as if Big Budget Movies Cost less on DVD.Just a thought."
2,Ugh. I paid $30 for an infomercial.,"The idea of the law of attraction is interesting and I plan to learn more about it, as I haven't decided yet whether ""I believe."" However, this DVD is a painful piece of crapola -- an infomercial that makes wild claims without more than the merest, barest, tiniest hint of factual support. It doesn't help, either, that it clearly has aspirations of being the next DaVinci Code. Ugh. If you can, borrow this DVD from a friend. If not, rent it. If not that, try to buy it used (I can't imagine that there aren't a lot of them for sale). It was painful to watch -- and that was true despite the fact that I'm *granting* that the law of attraction *may* be true. Did I mention, ""ugh""? The extra star rating (2 instead of 1) is attributable to the interesting topic, not the way in which it was presented."
1,Materialism and Selfishness at its best,"""The Secret"" tells people that all their dreams can come true if they want it enough. If they just keep thinking about it, then the magic genie (the universe) will grant their wishes. It is selfish and ignorant. Positive thinking does a lot to change people's lives, but they are making the changes, not the universe. I am a Christian and believe that God does change our lives, but we ultimately decide how our lives unfold due to our decisions and attitudes. ""The Secret"" is a scam, made up from faulty philosophy and science to get people to give them their money. Go ahead and watch the video if you want, but then do the research. I guarantee that you'll see why ""The Secret"" fails and how your thoughts really impact your life."
3,A Get Rich Scheme,"I'm giving this film a 3 star rating because as a documentary, it is good and well put together. I've watched it several times and I feel duped by Rhonda Byrne because all she has managed to do is give all the people who participated in the film, a forum in which to get rich. It's a get-rich scheme for them, not us, the viewers! And, I wonder why Ester Hicks isn't in the extended version???"
5,can you feel it--I can,I bought a copy of the Secret after watching it a friend's house. I had to have a copy of my own. I know what you're thinking but it does work--it's just sometimes you need a little push in the right direction. If you don't already have a copy of your own you will want to have one after watching it.
1,Shame on the producers and all invovled in this video.,"Hyping matierialism is just plain nasty. The only people benefiting are the ones involved in making this nasty thing. I have only one thing to say to all who think ""things"" will bring them everlasting happiness....and this is a quote from a song...""you can't pull a U-Haul behind your hearse""!Happiness is found within - yes, positive thoughts help a whole lot, but ""stuff"" isn't going to magically appear without good old fashioned work! I know some people who have a lot of ""stuff"" - huge house, big fancy cars, big huge boats - and you know what? The more they have, the more they want, and they are NOT happy!!!Marcie - Yoga Teacher"
3,Only 3 stars for the movie and 5 suns for the message in it.,"I thought the film was rather ok. But that was because I am terribly interested in the subject. For some reason my whole family (not at all interested in the power of the mind) left the room. The movie is exactly like the book; all the time people (famous, or not so famous) tell you how ""it"" has worked for them.So this movie has no plot or story (or on the other hand many). They (my family) watched the march of the Penquins and the Weeping Camel, just to say they are not barbares. The Redfield movie I also found interesting, but clumsy.I found the book more encouraging, but thats because I like reading"
4,ENTERTAINING AND THANK GOODNESS IT IS!!!,"Yes, we have all been exposed to many of the ""secrets"" that this dvd has to offer. However, what a smooth and entertaining way to tie it all together. Much of the information is helpful and watching it on video does add a new layer of absorption to the ideas. These ideas are not original but it makes you feel confident that you really do control your destiny. I knew that already, but it shows you a fuller picture...baby talk sometimes in our busy lives is neccessary. There are so many ways to spend money and some movies made today are so full of NEGATIVE EMOTIONS. We gain nothing after watching those videos...buy this instead.I guarantee that you will enjoy it and feel good about your life or be clearer about the changes that you need to make."
2,The Secret (Extended Edition) DVD,I was rather disappointed with this product. It takes what is otherwise a fine message for living and dilutes it through the use of schmaltzy visuals focused on materialism.
3,So-So,"Although when I first saw the cd I was taken in with it's message, then I started to think about what exactly had this Rhonda written? Nothing! the Whole cd was narrated by all the people to enhance their programs. This is not to say that it doesn't work...it might...but 90% luck is envolved for sure! She was no where on this cd and their were no revelations about her ""trip"" into this fantasy."
5,The Secret,This is a very powerful DVD and I think everyone should have it and view it periodically to stay focused on living life to the fullest. When life is happening we can get side tracked and not be focused on how things are happening until we are stressed. People should view this DVD from time to time so they don't forget just how to live life to the fullest; get the most out of their experiences.
2,"Same concept, just packaged differently","I should have known that this was just hype, but I bought it anyway. The content is nothing new, just packaged differently. Other authors have been writing about this type of subject for years. Have some faith, and you will get the same results."
2,A new version of the same old thing.,"This DVD reminded me of my days watching Depak Chopra and others of the same ilk. I wonder why there is such a buzz over ""The Secret""?"
4,good not great,"I was really excited to get this video, and I do feel the principal is true about the law of attraction. When you watch the video, you can feel the truth of it and think ""I always knew this!"" It encompasses what all the great leaders and teachers have been trying to tell us throughout time. My only critique would have to be that its focus is mainly based on getting material things rather than spiritual; however you can apply it to spiritual things as well. I watched the dvd ""What the bleep do we know"" and found it much more gratifing, and interesting to note- two of the teachers of The Secret are on this film as well."
1,Hocus Pocus Poof,"Like majic this DVD gives you a quick run down of what you can do to make billions and buy that jet you always wanted. Oh, did I mention you can cure aids if you post a sign up on your mirror and chant words that you write down? It is amazing how gullible people are. I think some churches of prosperity have to take the blame for this. Telling people they can have anything, but, the only person who really gets the bulk of the, ahem, ""blessings"", are the ones telling everyone else they can have these things. Rhonda Byrne is rich...every one in this video are millionaires, and, you can catch them hanging out at marketing, seminars, workshops, and the like. They'll be at these marketing events honing their skills learning techniques such as, ""how to grab the emotions of people to get them to whip out their credit cards"".All of these people are former sales people and current marketers. They know, ""the real secret"" and now that I shared it with you, so, do you."
5,Good Movie,This movie is good and is right up there with What The Bleep Do We Know.Make sure you get the original copy with Ester Hicks or you wont understand what is being said as there are alot of copies with Ester being deleted so that copy is not worth buying. With out Ester Hicks the secret still remains the secret..The universe has infinite possibilities. Most people today live in lack and have been so conditioned to see lack everywhere when there is really all abundance. What we think about we bring about and how you feel determines what you experiece. Check out Abraham Hicks web site for real time workshops all over the USA.Life is suppose to be fun. The Law Of Attraction is the most important law of the universe.
1,don't want even to give it 1 star!,"I absolutely would not recommend this dvd - it is like watching a bad advert for something ridiculous. Do not waste your money, there is nothing here common sense hasn't afforded you already! Oh dear!"
5,The Secret Revealed,"Fabulous portrayal of the power of thought and feeling. I guess a lot of folk just know deep down that """" as a man thinks, So shall he be"""" The Secret is to know how to harness this process and with practice anything you want is there for you. A wonderful film that you will probably watch over and over again and really want to share with others."
1,disappointed,"everyone makes so much out of this---all i see is a bunch of people trying to profit off of a timeworn cd. oprah wants to say LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME, and others are just trying to make a buck. if they really thought what they say then why did they make the price so exorbitant????????"
3,The book is better,I have both the DVD and the book on CD. The book is a superset of what is on the DVD and is great to listen to in the car.My only problem with the material is that she/they make statements that they claim are facts but never give the sources for the information or substantiate it in any other way. This has the same feel as listening to reporters state incomplete (biased) statistical information to backup their opinions on NPR.
3,Fast-soul-food,"I want to rating 5 because The Secret IS GREAT, but I have rated it 3 because it is presented in a very ""fast-soulfood"" way and I don't think it has enough substance. If you are ready for substance read/listen to: Wayne Dyer/C. Myss/Nieal Donald Walsch/ Louise Hay/Debbie Ford"
4,The Secret - Extended Edition,"Very interesting concept. Nothing really new, but an affirmation of what I've always believed."
3,Selfishness in a box,"My impression of ""The Secret"" is that its is an inspiring, thought-provoking message that boils down to ""happy thoughts yield happiness,"" which is increasingly supported by research in positive psychology. Unfortunately, the presentation focuses a lot on gaining wealth to the detriment of other things that can make you happy. Wealth may be one of these, but I got the impression that the makers of the secret inserted their own reasons for making this DVD into its content."
4,The movie lacks depth.,"Yes it is a good movie. It got people thinking and talking. The movie seriously lacked depth. It seems watered down for the masses which is a damn shame. And what they were talking about is not a secret at all. No one is keeping this information from us. We just werent seeking it out. The original movie had Abraham with Esther and Jerry Hicks. They should have left them in, they are the missing element in the movie. That would have given them some depth and heart. After I watched the movie I honestly felt like I was watching a long infomercial. But the content and purpose is good, yet a teaser all the same."
1,Nothing Substantial,"I also heard about this book from co-workers and was curious but very open minded. After reading it I don't get the hype. Outside of the basic truth that our thoughts affect our behaviors and vice versa (in other words it is important to think positive and to love yourself) there was nothing of substance, nothing to really hang your hat on......basically it is the author's thoughts about how the universe works. Thoughts are okay but you need to back it up with substantial support if you are going to ""sell"" it to folks. If a refund was offered I would be shipping this book back today. Also it did contradict itself in places and did not make complete sense in others....Look elsewhere if you are looking for wisdom or original thinking. I am disappointed that this one made it past the publishers."
4,Very well presented,"I'm a self-improvement junkie. However, after many many years, I've finally realized what THE SECRET is trying to say (as well as all the other people) - it is all about your thoughts. I liked the presentation so well and wanted so much for young people to learn this much sooner than I did, that I showed it to the English classes I had been substituting for a week. About less than half the students paid any attention, but if only one was able to make the most of his/her life as a result, I am happy.More products like this really should be directed toward young people before they form very bad thought habits. This one is presented well enough that a young person so inclined would find it interesting."
4,A great eyeopener,This video was a great eyeopener. I truly believe after watching this has me relize how much greater my life will be. I truly reccommend this video to anyone who wants to achieve more in all aspects of your life.
3,Part of the story,"I really enjoyed this book and tape. It does speak to me. Problem is it is not the whole story or answer.You have to follow your path, do your personal work, work toward healing those wounds and thenthe miracles start to happen. You CAN manifest anything you wish by giving it energy. Just don'twant everyone to be disappointed when it doesn't manifest the way they want it. You will get whatis for your greatest healing from the Universe.[...]Kirstin"
3,Thoughtful,"While there is not much new here, sometimes we need to be reminded of what is important and that we need to love ourselves."
1,Bah... no secret here...,"This is a documentary trying to make you believe there is a ""secret"" about how to attract and obtain more positive things happen to you in your daily life told by certain individuals such as authors, actors, mathematicians, visionaries, doctors, scientists, religious characters and some that apparently experienced ""The Secret""... ok if you want to believe everything said in this video. The star is for certain of the individuals being interviewed to make us believe such a thing because they are truthfully entertaining (and you have to select at least 1 star), plus you want to listen until the end just to see how much BS they can really talk about in 90 minutes. My last words are that I'm thankful I didn't pay for this infomercial!"
5,An opportunity not to be missed.,"Wonder why things rarely work out for you? Everything you try seems to fail? Maybe you have been cursed with 'bad luck' because you never have enough money; relationships never last; businesses go to the wall?This dvd will enlighten you for sure. Every time you watch it you will feel happier about life and more confident about your future. And don't worry - it has nothing to do with religion, either.This is a 'must-see'. I would give it 6 stars if I could."
5,The Secret,"I am a big fan of positive thinking. You do bring to you what you say and think about. I have read the book, heard the audio, and seen the movie. I highly recommend this."
3,A Lot of Hype for little content,"The information in this DVD is far from new, in fact, Esther Hicks was in the original and it is my understanding that she withdrew her support when there was disagreement about the presentation of the material. She and her husband, Jerry, have been writing about the Law of Attraction for over 20 years, so it is far from a ""secret"". But marketing can sell repackaged, old products. Suffice to say I was underwhelmed by the content and openmouthed with admiration at a marketing plan that even ropes in Oprah."
5,WOW!!!,"What a revelation!!! For me, just a confirmation of what I've done all my life, but for many others I refer the movies to, it's a real shock, and most importantly, a real help in making their lives better. Wanna know what positive thinking means? Watch it! Fantastic!"
3,Great for those with VERY open minds but certainly not for everyone,"I recently just started to take an interest in the law of attraction and philosophies about consciouness, sprituality and quantum physics. I think there's a lot of interesting perspectives from several interesting people on this DVD. But there are some individuals who come across a little more like car salespeople rather than intellectual scholars, doctors and scientists. I also think the dramatic ways in which a lot of the concepts are presented and visually depicted throughout history and the epic-sounding music and sound effects actually hinder its ability to establish credibility. That aside, I think the core message of ""you attract in life the things you think about most"" is very important for anyone to understand and embrace even if they question the validity of everything else that's presented."
3,The Secret review,The book does teach some good practices to keep a positive attitude and definitive help to improve the way you face things.On the other hand I found some of the testimonies difficult to believe maybe with less testimonies and more theory was a better.
5,MUST SEE THIS MOVIE,"AMAZING. IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS MOVE, TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS ---BUY THIS MOVIE. ITS AMAZING. LIFE CHANGING."
1,The Secret,There are several places when the video messes up. I was disappointed. I haven't had any previous problems with quality before.
5,My item arrrived in pristine condition.,"I received exactly what I requested, in a timely manner, and at very reasonable cost."
3,Interesting and helpful but not new,"While this information wasn't especially new, it was a great reminder. I run decluttering and time management workshops for a living for Inspired Honey(inspiredhoney.com) and so I like to have a break once in a while give my mind a tune-up (like my car). While this information is certainly not new. See the book You Can Heal Your Life written decades before or What the Bleep Do We Know or even lots of ideas from Proverbs in The Bible), it is still interesting information. If it gets people analysing their thoughts more and being more in control of their choices - I'm all for it!"
1,complete garbage,"what a waste of money!!! The ""power of attraction"" will solve all your problems. Of course!!!!!!"
3,Eh . . .take it with a grain of salt,"The Secret definitely leaves you with something to think about. I think there is value in positive thinking and putting that energy out to the universe. But the video is a little hokey. I feel that it's dumbed down for the masses, and I think I'd buy into more if it wasn't so focused on achieving material goods by ""applying the secret""--we all should know that is not the key to happiness and inner-peace."
3,Oprah Convinced Me,"Starts off super corney; I nearly shut it off. The content is not much more than I saw on the Oprah Show (how I found out about this). It's all in what you want to take out of it. I kept waiting for something more; something worth my purchase price and time. I didn't get it. The basic concept is a positive attitude will bring great things into your life and we know that already. Having this DVD touted as the Secret to a happier, more financially rewarding, better life was misleading to say the least. Maybe I was hoping for the magic answer and there is no such thing. Yes, you will have a good life if you see the world in a good light but they go so far as to say the bad things in your life come your way because you bring them on and of course that's not always the case. They make a few very good points that will be beneficial to those who take their advice. For me, if I had it to do all over again I would not purchase this item."
5,The Secret - DVD Review,"If you're ready to change your life, buy this video today! If not, keep doing what you're doing and watch me take off!! The techniques and examples are extremely clear and consistent with my Christian views. I've already had several postive experiences after practicing and implementing the life stratgies presented."
2,Not much of a secret,"The overall message was a good one, but I didn't need to spend $40 to find out. And frankly, 20 minutes in this thing turns into an infomercial on how to get rich. Also, I didn't appreciate hearing blame put on people who get sick, as if the reason they got sick was because they didn't think positively or because they didn't truly belive that they would get better. Like, how do you account for those positive spiritual people who got cancer from the environment they lived in? Thoughts are very powerful but they cannot overcome everything and this video pretty much claimed that thoughts could overcome anything. Another thing I didn't like were all the ""miraculous"" stories that were told with no fact or proof to back them up. To me, this video is a HUGE hit to Opera's credibility. I will never trust her again."
3,Verbatim Copied from Cody Horton.,"Cody Horton wrote several books back in the 1990's regarding the Law of Attraction. This is a nearly word for word copy of Ms. Horton's works. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it for the visual effects and it does drive home its point."
1,DVD order,Sent the wrong DVD. I will have to either buy a new copy or return the existing one and re-request the correct copy again.
3,DVD,Was worth the look at but found the book of more value as it got you thinking about what was being read. All in all would recommend both to anyone interested in this subject.
5,Very motivating,"I watch this movie every year around the beginning of the year to start the year off right. Very motivating, helps with positive thinking, really works if you use it! I've given it to multiple family members who all use ""the secret"" now, too."
2,secret revealed,The powers help those who help themselves. This notion is as old as the hills and we certainly didn't need a movie to tell that all over again.
2,The Secret,For people who like this kind of documentary it is good enough.Otherwise it is just for curiosity.
4,Positive Influence,"Worth watching to get you out of negative thinking. Some of it is a bit far-fetched, but can also help to motivate you to think about how you want your future to look - and how you need to begin thinking to make it happen."
1,I encourage everyone to question the reality of this program,"I first watched this movie when it first came out and I was hooked. I truly believed I could do anything just by thinking about it. However, nothing can be further from the truth. You can't get everything you want by wishing and ""sending vibes,"" you have to actually WORK AT IT. Of course they mention ""oh, yes you have to do something than just sitting and wishing..."" but it is the actual WORK that you do that gets you where you want to be, NOT THE WISHING. The secret, I believe, is just another pseudoscience that replaces the placebo effect. Everyone thinks ""wow, I sent happy thoughts to everyone and I got the job I wanted!"" But the reality is you got the job because you applied and were chosen. The real ""Secret"" is you have fallen victim to a logical fallacy."
1,You have to work for what you want.,"You have to work for what you want. The universe does not care what you want! This movie is mental illness. Waste of time.James A. Ray was a major part of this movie. On Jun 22, 2011 - James A. Ray was convicted of three counts of negligent homicide in his followers' deaths at an Arizona ceremony. On November 18, 2011, was sentenced to two years in prison. The secret really help him, and his his followers."
4,It is a feel great movie,"This movie is wonderful, i have been given self confidence and for years I felt bad about myself but this movie opened my eyes, and for you haters out there..........you don't have to accept what it is saying, but that is your loss."
3,A bit too much hype; Try other Books,"I have listened to the audio CD & watched the DVD and the secret is NO SECRET. If one is a beginner maybe it would be a start but if you have been reading and looking for personal and spiritual improvement books previously,this CD is no more than too many superficial platitudes. I did not find it that deep in its approach to questions of personal and spiritual growth. Indeed if you are looking for some books or audio CDs, I would storngly recommend 1) The ""Power of the NOW "" by Eckhart Tolle and 2) ""The Law of Attraction"" by Jerry and Esther Hicks. These books or CDs are much deeper in their appraches to how we can view our reality and achieve both personal and spiritual improvements. Try them and you will not be disappointed. In the truest sense you shall acheive clarity of purpose and inner calm/joy."
5,The Secret - DVD edition,"I like having the visual and putting faces to name. I also purchased the audio CD. I watched the DVD first, then listen to the audio to reforce lessons. See my review of the audio for more info."
2,Not what I expected!,"I expected the ""Secret"" to be something life changing and opening up something spectacular with in myself. Instead all I got out of this was think possitive and your life will change. Well I have always been a possitive thinker."
1,Just a slicker version,"No matter how old I get I can't believe that P.T. Barnum summed it up in just a few words,"" There's a sucker born every minute""Vincent Peale said it better in the book ""The Power of Positive Thinking""It just goes to show that people are not reading as much today as they have in the past. Instant gratification! DVD's, video games etc., etc."
1,disapointed,When I opened this item I threw everything away. I know stupid of me so I didn't know how to reach the one I purchased this from. The DVD was defective.. it kept stoping and skippig. I had to keep trying to run it again. I was disappointed. I thought it might have been my player even though it wasn't very old. When I swapped it for another DVD I had it played fine so this one purchased was defective. If they wanted to replace this item with one that works I would be glad to rate it again.
3,disapointed,Nothing was said that Esther Hicks ws not in this extended version of the secret. If I knew how to return it for the version with her in it I would. I coulden't believe that the extended version was a outright lie and had less in it. The naming of it as the extended version so that they could reproduse it for more commercial gain by excluding Esther from the dvd is a scam to the public and I will not be endorsing anything from the secret to anyone.....
5,Fabulous Product,"""The Secret"" is more than I would have expected! I love it, it inspires me as I listen to it each day! Many changes have happened in my life and has brought me closer to God by listening to ""The Secret""!"
3,"Motivational, but worth all the hype","This is definitely motivational material. I think it is a mirror of Christian faith and what the Bible teaches. However, it does not replace Christianity; it compliments it. One must be careful to not put their hopes in things or events that are absolutely inconceivable. This is not magic."
2,Secret,"A waste of good money! Only teaches you as if it is not knownalready to be a positive person in your outlook to life andgood things will happen to you. Somewhat true but come on,common sense tells you that a A positive attitude = confidence= people are drawn to you and great things will happen sincepeople like to be around positive happy people. So word ofadvise to those who want to purchase this, save money, bepositive and you will have good things happen to you and theadditional funds from not purchasing this for something youreally want."
2,Read the book,"The Secret is not a secret at all. The movie is an obsticle to the exercise of having the life you deserve and still care for your fellow man. Be thankful in all things. It is so simple and yet seemingly impossible to get started. Plow through and you will amaze yourself to the point of disbelief. This is another hint to what the Bible was really saying. Read the book or get it on CD, CD set is best by far. Avoid the DVD."
1,Stupid,"It is a good thing to have positive attitude and thoughts, but simply being positive will not get you what you want in life. You need hardwork+good luck+being positive, to have good things come true.This movie puts too much emphasis on positive thoughts, and not saying anything about hardwork. The implication of with merely postive thoughts, you can accomplish anything in your life, is very wrong."
1,Rubbish!,"All the attractive forces from these ""illuminated"" ones and yet all I felt is extreme repulsion of tripe and hot air. Sure there're microscopic grains of truth any halfwit could dose out: you've got to want it; think as who you want to be; want that million? get your behind off the couch and do something about it. Right, the real secret? write some books or make a film but make sure to leave plenty of ambiguity, sprinkle some cliché here and there, recruit some success-story-for-hires to lend it credence and respectability, wrap the whole thing in a shroud of mystery and promise of imminent revelation, and voila! call yourself a philosopher, a spiritual crusader, an entrepreneur and watch the dough rolls in. I'm surprised Deepak Chopra wasn't invited but maybe he was - I just didn't watch it that closely. Boys are we ever ""at a spiritual crossroad"", ever so close to the Ultimate Secret, the Ultimate Answer (42 by the way)."
2,A liberal point of view...,"I think this is a good movie to watch ... once.It has some great ideas and positive thinking however, it continues to talk about a 'higher power' and it never gives God credit. I really liked the idea of focusing on the positive. If you are into politics then you will see this video is biased.If you are bored and like PBS type movies then I think this is a great thing for you to watch. I watched it twice and the 2nd time was hard to sit through."
1,the secret,Actually my choice of stars would be at the minus level. This is a poorly disguised blatant self serving INFOMMERCIAL. It is boring to the point of tears. I don't appreciate being preached to. I thought I was purchasing entertainment. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I have studied and used this information for eons and maybe it does have some value in reaching the masses who might be looking for this information. But it certainly was not for me.I am returning it to Amazon today with this review attached.
3,The Secret DVD,We enjoyed the DVD of the Secret...however...I could have purchased it cheaper at SAM'S or BJ'S!
5,Great Program,"If you are a skeptic, once you get over the passionate delivery and just listen to the actual theory and program it is hard to deny. I have seen this in action although I never called or canned it ""The Secret"" it is simply consistent habits and thought processes of successful people. I highly suggest everyone either watch the DVD, read the book, or listen to the CD's."
2,A Secret All Of Us Already Knew,I think we all know that we have the power it takes to will ourselves to get the things we want in life. I tuned into the Oprah show to see what the big deal was about The Secret but it's something most of us have already been taught by our parents or school and alot of us from religion. This dvd just shows some interesting other ways to ask for the things you want in life. If you really need help with that kind of thing then this dvd might be a good place to start but the majority of us already know the secret and I bet you will be surprised that you do to.
2,"Save yourself $30. Here's the ""Great Secret""","The Law of Attraction.Like attracts Like, at least in this producer's head.In the rest of the REAL physical universe, opposites attract.If you REALly want to know how the laws of attraction work it's no ""secret"", just take a look at a battery. One end has a ""+"" symbol on it. The other end has a ""-"" symbol on it and the ONLY reason it supplies electrical current is because opposites attract.The only reason any of us are here is because our two parents, who were the ""opposite"" sex, were ""attracted"" to each other.There is nothing ""metaphysical"" about the secret. It's a waste of $30. I'm ashamed to admit that I got caught up in the hype after Oprah peddled it twice on her show."
4,An interesting way to look at the universe,"My daughter-in-law had a copy of the Secret and I have since given a copy to my daughter who is in the midst of a divorce. She has been through so many hard times and her thinking patterns are all compulsive and NEGATIVE.She has dwelled on the past and wallowed in her misery for over a year. She has really had a rough time! The Secret is helping her get focused on her future and the better things in life. It basically is helping her retrain her thinking.The movie does a lot of good, but the book ties it all together, so I would buy both. The book is a jewel! Watching the DVD over and over and applying the principles will bring results.Many of us need help in pulling out of depressions and with negative thinking. The Secret is a way out of the darkness that can be applied to life.I am a Christian, so for me, God works; but I still appreciate the Secret's message. I am going to apply some of these secrets in my life to sell our house!"
5,All that is good with the world,"Regardless whether you believe in ""God"" or in ""The Universe"" or in a ""Higher Power"", this is a great way of learning how to form a positive outlook on life. The news media today is nothing but hate and death and crime and socialism. Buy this DVD and the CD and make positive images and gratitude your daily routine. I watch the DVD a few times a week and I listen to the CD's everyday during my commute to work. I'm happier, I'm calmer, I laugh more and I can handle life without getting stressed to the max. My beautiful Wife and I LOVE this DVD and the CD's."
1,is God excluded from the secret?,"This DVD is purely new age. It reinforces the power of the mind over God . God is not viewed as the creator and the master of our destiny. It is a shame how people think that we can replace God. There is not secret.There is revelation in the Bible. If you want to read a good book , buy the "" Purpose Driven Life"". Life is not about you, It is about God.They should have called it the SECRAP"
4,The Secret,If you are searching for something in your life I highly reccommend this DVD. You will develop a phenomenol change in attitude.
1,All about stuff,"Only the materialistic crybaby need watch. If you believe thought is more powerful than action, then this movie is for you. What a marketing scam."
1,Tried to vision this as a good movie but it did not work.,At the beginning I said to myself--this must be a great movie because of the great reviews. After thirty minutes of boredom I said to myself--this has to be a good movie soon. Then after an hour someone slapped me and I realized--this movie is B.S.
2,Wasn't sure what to think...,"Purchased ""The Secret"" on a suggestion from my wife. I wasn't sure what to think other than, ok, as long as I only think good thoughts, everything will magically be great. I understand Oprah endorsed this but isn't everything already great for her?I don't necessarily recommend it unless you have some very deep belief in positive reinforcement and it's effects on the planet earth."
3,The Secret,"This DVD did have a very good message, but it was very repetitive. I got the point at the very beginning of it, and it continued to hammer this point over and over."
3,Ok,"This has some good theories that I've found in other self-help books and in speaking to life coaches, but I am not sure if it is exactly a life changing secret. For example, having positive thoughts and visualization are elements that I've heard emphasized in other settings. However, I felt the dream board idea was good as a reminder to self and to help in visualization. So overall, the movie is still nice to watch and to give you a little positive boost, but the extent to which you can and should apply it to your life is still dependent on yourself."
5,Life Altering!,An absolutely incredible and inspirational video about how live and love your life. You will come to appreciate yourself for who you are and its an overview of how to attract positive expieriences in your life. You'll LOVE IT!
2,over rated video,"Video can certainly try to change your way of thinking, but we all have this knowledge inside of us. This video was over rated with the press."
3,excellent information,I really liked the content but thought the presentation was a little creepy. The DA---DA---- dada music. I'm sure that many will not be disturbed by the way the information was presented but personally; I had to force myself to continue watching it. It was worthwhile though and I'm glad I stuck with it. I will watch it more.
1,What a sham,"In the movie she speaks of how she discovered the secret, how it changed her life, and how she just wanted a way to get the message out to other people. Now that's a load of BS right there. Think about it, if I have some form of knowledge that I truly want to share with others to help make their lives better, am I going to create a ""mysterious"" DVD and sell them for $30 a pop? Worse yet, it originally came out at $19.99 and incredibly soon thereafter they pulled those off the shelf and came out with the ""Special Edition""? Oh c'mon!!! There's nothing special about it, except it costs $10 more.If you haven't already bought this, I would highlt advise against doing so. You're much better off purchasing a book on the law of attraction, not some form of media hype that gets a disguised label of ""The Secret""."
1,Lose this Secret,The SECRET to not using critical thinking skills.The SECRET to having absolutely no chance of genuinely understanding or experiencing existence.The SECRETE to admiring smug pseudo-gurus who want your money and admiration over your welfare.The SECRET to following exactly in the wrong direction.The SECRET to losing
1,the secret is.....,PT Barnum was all wrong; he forgot to figure in population growth. The secret to my success would be a mailing list of all that purchased this package of goods and market to them. Easy sell.
3,Another Secret Movie,It was good - it was The Secret - it was more about this topic and I would recommend it but am actually getting tired of the topic. If you are new to this topic I strongly recommend this....
3,Hmmmmm,"Sorry, this wasn't quite what we thought it was. Seems to be narrations by this person and that person. Thought it was a full length movie of some type. Oh well better luck next time!"
1,Crap,"This book is just another waste of paper, I bought the book and the dvd and then i sold it here, I learned nothing."
5,Interesting,I bought this after a friend recommended it. I found it to be interesting to listen to. I'm happy with the product and the seller.
3,DVD small damage,"DVD came a little scratch, had one part that the DVD player had to skip over damage area, other then that, it was fast service."
1,What a waste of just about everything....,"Minus 5 stars is more like what this ""thing"" deserves.... let's be polite and call it an infomercial. Same principle: they repeat and repeat over and over again, ad nauseum, (yes, I accumulated these redundant terms to give you an idea what to expect!), what a great ""secret"" they are going to share with the rest of us. And what a tremendous difference it will make to mankind if only we all knew about this. The bottom line is, it is all a lengthy litany of sales praises, and nothing substantial in it.I am the persevering kind, so I went well into it, over half an hour, although I was sure after 5 minutes that this was pointless. But I wanted to be absolutely sure... it is a flick for suckers.So, if you have a life and if you have no time to lose, watch something educational, exciting, funny or philosophical instead. You'll be glad you did!"
3,INSPIRING,This DVD really makes you think about the power that thought has over your everyday life......the power of your mind having control over your life. what a great concept. I am going to try it!!
5,One of the best...,One of the best documentary that I have ever watched. If people follow and beleive on what it says in the video they will have a much better life...Highly recommended...
3,Rent before you buy,"The DVD is a good reminder to have a positive attitude about life and to not think negative in any way. It reinforces the truth that many people don't find themselves worthy of the wonderful opportunties and things that ""the universe"" has to offer. The Secret teaches to ""Ask, Believe and Receive"". Didn't our grandma's already teach us this ""secret"" and tell us to do it every night before we went to bed? I would suggest you rent before you buy to see if it is a DVD you would like in your personal library."
1,Way too cheesey!,"There are some interesting concepts here, particularly the idea that your thoughts create your reality. But this feels like one long, cheesey infomercial. (One of the ""experts"" featured tries to make a point by saying that nobody knows how electricity works, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.) And it's so intensely focused on acquiring material posessions, money, trips, etc. I've gone to a seminar called the Landmark Forum in which there is a much more intellectually rigorous examination of similar concepts, and it was a powerful and meaningful experience. This is dreck. I'm going to return my copy."
5,The Secret (Ext Ed),"Put your bias and previous misconceptions aside - open up - and just sit back and soak it all up. I just realised after it all that I had a book previously on this subject and hadn't applied it and had forgotten all about it! I recommend also reading ""Excuse me your life is waiting"" by (I think the author's name is) Lynne Grabhorn (or something like that)."
5,Who Knew?,"I've only watched this once so far - I need to see this at least 3 or 4 more times to grasp all the ramifications this DVD offers. I find the message wonderful, uplifting, exhilirating, so full of hope. I plan to map the remainder of my life using The Secret. I recommend it to all who are confident enough to take command of their own lives and live it to it's fullest potential."
3,Decide for yourself.,"In theory it sounds great, but you would have to decide for yourself if you believe what the secret is all about.The only way is to get the book or DVD. I got the DVD becuase I dont' particularly care to read, unless I have to.I would either borrow the book or DVD if i could before spending the money."
3,Visaulize your new car while people starve around the globe,"I gave this a three because as far as this particualr ""secret"" goes, which is story told throughout the culture in various forms, it's not particularly well done.But more importantly, this story of""get what you want"" and more, more, more is one that Americans should carefully consider. Is it true? I don't know. But if it is, then doesn't it seem more appropriate to visualize world peace, as they say, then to focus on consumer goods and accept the words of ""experts"" who say that you don't have to care how you get them? I guess the people who are working in sweatshops around the world and watching the destruction of their natural environment to satisfy our visualization just aren't vibrating on the right frequency of desire."
3,The Secret,"Overall, it is an inspiring DVD, but something is missing, like mention of taking action in order to make your dreams come true."
5,Glad I saw it.,"Great information contained on this DVD. Kinda cheesy at some parts, but I realize I wasn't there to watch awesome special effects or acting, I was there to hear a message, and that message hit me hard. My life is in a state of transitional change, because I saw this movie. A positive change I may add.Thank You! I'm soooooo glad that I discovered this movie."
2,Disappointing,It was built up to big this BIG SECRET and it was just different people talking about putting the positive out there and it comes to you.. I am sure they are laughing all the way to the bank
5,Very well presented and powerful truths,"This ""Secret"" if understood and practiced in a person's life will transform nearly every phase of a person's or a family's life! Powerful concepts!"
5,We LOVE it!!!,"My husband and I absolutely love this movie and we also have the book. The secret is very simple to learn and use, you just have to want it! What could possibly be wrong with wanting to better your life? I highly recommend the movie and the book!!! I have watched it several times and never get sick of it."
1,The Secret to Steal your Money!,This is just a way for someone to steal your money. Come up with a simple concept and try to make it all mysterious just so people will waste their money on what should be called a Lame Infomercial. Simply ridiculous!
1,Brain Candy For The Gullable,"Seems like there is a NewAge (pronounced like sewage) hawker on every corner these days. This gang of psuedo-smarties from the likes of an over-channeling Ramtha really go the distance to make their snake oil look like science. Just about everything in this ""film"" about quantum physics is wrong or taken out of context.The ""Secret"" is anything but and looks like a bad corporate motivational film. And I love the ""experts"" especially the cute little Indian guy that has solved the Unified Field Theory - gosh a guy smarter than Hawking, Einstein and Heisenberg who all failed in their attempt! The piece reminds me of something a Fundamentalist film would look like - complete with Adam and Eve riding herd on dinosaurs.If you have no clue about quantum physics, this is NOT the place to start or before you know it you will be dancing naked around a tree on a full moon chanting, ""I am God, I really am, give me money Oh Great Me! I wish therefore I get."" Malarky!"
1,fools gold,"a friend recommended this to me and i ordered it from amazon. i have yet to finish it. like another reviewer, i was bored silly. the focus of what i did see was on materialism. how to get money and prosperity.the problem i have with this philosophy is that it reduces god to a magician, our faith to ""if we do it right"", ""if we are good"", then we are rewarded. in the christian tradition, that philosophy proven wrong by the death of jesus. he was not prosperous or financially wealthy. neither was ghandi. the buddha renounced his wealth. all credible religious traditions reject the concept of ""believe and the wealth will follow"".this philosophy is put out by ""snake-oil salespeople"". they must be laughing all the way to the bank -- they themselves have attracted money and we poor schmucks who purchased it have lost it. however, i'd rather have my soul than money."
4,The Secret,"Very Good DVD. Amazing Information! I feel they could have changed some things up though, by putting the God stuff at the beginning instead of the end! As we all know, we couldn't do anything without him! Would recommend this to anyone and everyone! But, I really liked the book better!"
1,A Terrible Movie,"This is a terrible movie. It's not entertaining, informative, or motivational. I had never heard of this and from the description I thought it had something to do with physics. It does have a physicist in it but he's a crank, just in it for the money, or both."
1,Please...save your money and your mind.,"I read this book long ago. It is, simply put, witchcraft repackaged. One of the central things I have and am learning? Life is not, never has been and never will be about me. Life is about making God happy by being like His Son Jesus Christ through Holy Spiritual re-birth and renewal - plan and simple. This is what we were made for and we can only experience true and lasting joy through confession of our sins, repentance and faith in Jesus Christ the Lord. May God bless you with this...Peace"
1,"Secret, I think not!!",The major tenets of this approach could have been thought up by a 5-year-old trying to maneuver around his mother's restrictions. The photography and dramatics made the product appear like it actually had something to say -- of course it did not!! I was quite disappointed that its major theme was not any better than what I can get from my local fortune teller.
1,Put it into practice.,"The Secret really isn't that complicated so here is what I suggest: instead of spending 30 bucks on this movie, go out and buy as many PowerBall tickets as the price will afford.Then, believe that you've won. I mean really really believe it. Know it. Act like it. Be grateful to the universe that you won the lottery. Keep it up for the entire week until the night of the drawing.Did you win?No?You must have done it wrong, bub.Now you know The Secret!"
1,Is this what we're reduced to nowadays?,"Don't. Just.....Just don't.Terrible. Awful. A woman conned my friend and I to come to her place to watch a movie. It was this. It was so, so, so bad. I felt like I was in an alternate universe where this was acceptable. So bad."
4,Good,"It is a little hoakie, but overall I do believe in positive thinking and it is a good reminder of how to apply that principle."
4,The Secret shares good insight on finding happiness in life.,"The Secret shares good insight on how to find happiness in life. The movie shares a lot of good ideas on how to focus on the things you want to bring into your life, along with how to do this. The only downfall of this movie is that it focuses quite a bit on having money as an essential part of being wealthy. I think that more time should have been spent on relationships and inner peace. Overall, this is a very good movie though and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new outlook on life."
4,Thought provoking,"I enjoyed watching The Secret. It's message reminded me of the movie, ""What the Bleeb Do We Know."" After watching it, you're motivated to start trying out some of the principles in the DVD. It's a good use of an hour and a half."
1,The Secret,"Very unhappy with the purchase, I expected a film instead the video is made up of short scrips, a waste of money."
2,Click your heals three times dorothy,while I don't dismiss that positive thinking and feelings are good for your life its a far stretch to say you can have all that you desire by simply wishing for it.I found it interesting with the author of chicken soup for the soul talking about how he lives in a 4 million dollar home and travels anywhere he desires and how wonderful his life is while he was pumping his book in the back ground with chickens on the back drop (subliminal advertising 101).So really bad things that happen to good people are a result of their negative thinking? This is dangerous thinking being presented as it places blame on victims. Take it in stride and not to the point of I can be a millionaire if I close my heals and click three times.Going through life in a positive manner is definitely beneficial to your well being but it wont bring some magical gifts from the universe.
5,its all what you do with it,"Change the way you think, change your life. This video is like a stepping stone, you will get out of life the effort you put into it. I wish people who think they have ""bad luck"" or are ""cursed"" would give as much attention to thinking positively as they affirm each day that they are ""doomed."" Be positive and believe that you can change your life through a change in thinking. The possibilities are endless."
4,Great Motivational DVD,This DVD was more then I expected. I have watched it several times now and find something wonderful each time. I watch it on days I need a lift and its amazing how much I get out of this.
3,Caroline,"The Secret is quite interesting, although it is more geared to financial happiness rather than internal happiness. Despite this I feel that they communicated the key messages effectively and I would recommend to view it. Please don't think this will change your life but it will make you aware of your negative thoughts and gives motivation and tools to help change these thoughts if your willing to put in the hard work."
3,The Secret,It was okay but I guess I just don't beleive all that stuff. I've tried to change my way of thinking but I don't know how you are to stay positive all the time with all the things that are going on in the world.
3,The Secret DVD,"like all products of this nature, ie, addressing success,prosperity, andself improvement, this item has much to offer to guide a person on hisroad to prosperity."
5,Thank You!,Thought-provoking and insightful; this is exactly what the world needs to focus on at this moment in time. I have watched the movie twice and found more information with each viewing regarding how to incorporoate the law of attraction into my life thus changing my life for the better. Now that I have been applying the principal of positive thinking I know I am on the right track as I have been getting validation on a daily basis. I highly recommend this to anyone who has been searching for answers and for those who are skeptical I offer the challenge of trying this approach for 30 days. You have nothing to lose and everthing to gain--your thoughts create your world so turn those dreams into reality no matter how out of reach they may seem. Outstanding!!!
5,Magnificient!,"This DVD is magnificient! From the moment I saw it I've been intrigued. I saw it everyday for 6 months. I just bought one for a friend. In fact, I bought 2 for friends of mine. I have a group that I introduced to The Secret and they couldnt get enough. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Not only is it a great to see but applying what you see is a must and a plus! If you put the things you see and hear into practice, you won't regret it! The day you watch it will be the first day of the rest of your wonderful life!"
1,Did anyone see the Larry King interview?,"Larry King did an interview with one of the men instrumental in ""The Secret"". King asked him about people ""attracting"" consequences to themselves (through vibes or some such hocus pocus). King specifically asked the guy if Jessica Lundsford attracted her murderer. The Secret guy answered that each of us attracts our own outcomes and that there are NO exceptions. This is just plain wicked and callous in view of what happened to that child. Stay away from ""The Secret"". I know I will. Bad ""vibes."""
1,Waste of time and money,"A friend of mine lent me this ""movie"" taking about how it was the greatest thing he'd ever seen and how it's going to change his life. I'm a big fan of motivational speakers and self-improvement teachings and have completely adopted a ""Constant and Never Ending Improvement"" approach to life. So, when I hear someone say such powerful things about some form of teaching, I'm immediately interested. This ridiculous pile of garbage is nothing more than a doctors amazing knowledge of marketing techniques and new spins on old ideas. This ""movie"" takes old school neuro-linguistic programming and makes the watcher/reader focus on the smallest most insignificant area of themselves. I'd be surprised if half of the watchers/readers of this horrible excuse for a money making scheme actually pull anything from it. Pass on this garbage and invest in some running shoes."
3,Not necessarily a secret but good nevertheless.,"Having attended metaphyical churches for over 20 years nothing in this DVD was new to me but it was interesting nevertheless. I do believe that the whole Davinci Code/Holy Grail type of introduction was overdone and the emphasis on materialistic things was somewhat unfortunate. And I am sure some may take offense as to how they portray illnesses. But hopefully if you are watching this DVD you are open-minded enough to overcome what I feel are the film's shortcomings.Overall, though, the message is great and it does work. Maybe not as dramatic as in the film, but once you start the practices ""The Secret"" discusses you will see a change in your life.If you have done even a modicum of reading into spirtual self-help, I am sure you have come across the concepts depicted in ""The Secret"". However, just as many professional certifications require continuing education; spiritual growth needs to be reinforced from time to time as well."
2,2 thumbs - down.,"I was unimpressed with the focus on material things throughout the entire movie. The concepts of getting what you give, reaping what you sow, karma...are not novel ideas and I would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for more than a new bike, ring, car, money, etc."
1,Byrne Should Have Kept this 'Secret' to Herself,"Many of these reviewers have made great points about how bad this movie, book and philosophy is, so I won't step on their good input.Want to know the real secret? everyone who buys or rents the movie, reads the book or listens to the audiofile are doing exactly what they're getting mad about!I can see it now... Byrne is sitting by her mailbox, imaginging checks in the mail from people who buy into her garbage... and it works! Beacuse people just want to see ""what all the buzz is about."" Guess what? She gets a cut of everything, so you're making the philosophy true - for HER.I suggest reading the only book anyone needs to know the truths of life, and it's no 'secret.' READ THE BIBLE!"
2,Some parts are argumental,"One of the main ideas in the DVD was ""the laws of attractoin"" they say that if you think money you will get money. Like attracts Like. But a simple primaryt school experament can show with the use of a magnet that opposites attract. I do not think that if you simply think posotive about something that you are just going to get it. I think that you should work hard and be re-warded for it.I do not agree with another comment that was made about GOD not being in the movie. I think that the movie was aimed for everyone and not just a specific religion. When you think about it god plays a role in spirtuality and not a massive role in mentality. A crazed killer can say that god is one with them but that their spirituality speaking not the mentality of the person.Overall though it is a good dvd to watch but it's one of those movies just like religion you either take seriously or not."
1,Waste of money,"I had several issues with this movie. First of all, I think a 10 year old could of done a better job putting a movie together than these people. Secondly, how can these people leave GOD out of the total equation of how the universe works? This should sound warning alarms for any Christians out there! Thirdly, they state that the secret behind the SECRET is the Law of Attraction: That like attracts like. They even quote quantum physics. However, anyone who has studied physics knows that like does not attract like, opposites attract. Perhaps they were thinking about the chemistry concept of Like Dissolves Like; I don't know. Needless to say, I agree that people should conduct their lives in a positive manner, but also understand that GOD is in charge, not us. This movie is dangerous."
1,The Secret is from Satan!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There's nothing wrong with positive thinking, but the so-called ""experts"" in this dvd cross the line!! What they say about God is false and this system they're trying to pass off to you definately qualifies as a CULT!!!! Beware of this!!"
1,waste of money,It's more self help without really saying anything new. Basis is positive thinking but also blames you for everything bad in your life. You drew it to yourself. How cruel to those with real problems that are absolutely not of their own doing. It's garbage.
1,Life changing,"I recently attended a convention with over 14 thousand other people. One of the biggest topices of discussion in all our conversations with others, was THE SECRET. It is no longer a secret. From the executives in the company all the way down the line, The Secret has changed people's attitudes and lives. I have never been so close to so many positive and like-minded people! There is the real secret, associate with and emulate what you desire. BE it, and it will happen. I have watched or listened to The Secret over a dozen times, and hear something new every time. It has become part of my life, and a WAY of life that will only bring good things to me and all my family."
4,Enlightening,"This dvd really tells us what we already know...its really just a reminder of what we need to do to succeed in life. I found it to be very inlightening, and when i find myself retreating back to a negative thought-i just watch the secret again..."
5,Whether you think it works or doesn't. . . your right.,"People who watch this have their mind made up on whether they believe it or not before they even remove the shrink wrap off the dvd case. But for those that are interested in the science or quantum side of ""The Law of Attraction"" there was a real good dvd released a few years ago which layed the foundation for this type of thinking and it's called ""What the Bleep!? - Down the Rabbit Hole"". I recommend the Quandam special edition its got loads of extras, three double sided dvds worth. Anyway I saw The Secret applied it to my life and saw results, I introduced friends to it and as expected those who belived saw results and those who didn't,didn't. Anyway I'm no poet so I'll be off just figured I'd share my opinions, peace and humptyness to all."
1,The Secret Never Was a Secret,"Too much hype for a concept that is known by any other number of names, with the same message. Metaphysics for the masses. Too many people are not going to understand all there is to this and will be disappointed."
3,Discovering the life you were meant to live,"This is an interesting read...but nothing more. I recently completed a study called BLUEPRINT FOR LIFE. The study first walks you through exercises that will help you discover what makes you unique. From this foundation you will create a ""life blueprint"" containing goals and action steps for five key areas of your life: RELATIONAL - PHYSICAL - FINANCIAL - CAREER - SPIRITUAL - giving you a set of personalized plans for your life. I now have something to keep me on task and striving towards my goals...I know that some of these items may change throughout my life...even throughout the year...but it has given me a sense of purpose and direction. Check out their website if you want more information.Blueprint for Life Kit Discovering the Life You Were Born to Live"
2,dvd,This is so commercial and exaggerated. The only ones getting rich are the producers. Positive thinking is wonderful but wishing will only get you so far.
1,Engage your brain! Please!,"Really? You can lose weight by not looking at fat people? Really?!From the other perspective, you think that starving - let along hungry - people don't visualize food and eating?The whole premise of ""The Secret"" is offensive. I don't know how these people sleep at night for coming up with this stuff, let alone robbing people of their money to read it or watch the video.(And I did watch this video ... more than once.)"
1,Just added to someone elses millions,I joined the crowd like a sheep and bought this to see what all the hype was about... Sadly all I did was add a few more dollers to someone elses million $ bank account.
1,They're profiting from INFOMERCIALS now??,"This was utterly TERRIBLE, in my opinion. The basic infomercial level production values were there.But rationally, morally and in many other ways this was one of the most frightening symptoms of a pathological society I have ever seen. Sorry to pan this so badly, folks. See it for yourselves and make up your OWN mind. I'd like to see things that espouse POSITIVE virtues (as opposed to greed and selfish thinking) make the charts instead of this dreck. Instead - just choose to be a good person. With every decision you make in your life - ask yourself the queston: ""can doing what I am about to undertake POSSIBLY hurt anybody another person or diminish the quality of their life?""I can't support this, sorry..!"
5,The best intro to the law of attraction.,"The first time I watched The Secret I was introduced to mind altering information. I loved the way it was presented. It was very educational, extremely entertaining and totally inspiring.I later found out that the authority figures who appear in the movie are great teachers and through them I discovered even more and continue my education to this day.Some people complain that the information presented doesn't delve into all of the steps necessary to manifest the life of your dreams. But this was not it's purpose. It is a fantastic introduction and if you choose to continue on your journey and wish to become an expert you must expand your education beyond this movie. There's only so much that a movie can do, and what this movie is here to do is to touch, move and inspire you which it does so perfectly."
2,"Be careful, there are TWO versions of this movie","This has been pretty well reviewed, but what I didn't see mentioned is that there are TWO versions of this movie, and I bought the wrong one in my opinion. The original version contained Esther Hicks / Abraham, and this extended version cut out all her scenes. You can google the UTube presentation for why. While I liked The Secret's overall positive message and that it's getting out to a broad audience, I do agree with it's detractors that it's very surface and pretty hard to put into practice (it's an MTV-style gloss-over). But I'm mostly annoyed that I didn't get to see the one presenter I really wanted to see and who has been discussing LOA for years longer than anyone else in this video. The original version of this movie is out of print, so instead I purchasedIntroducing Abraham - The Secret Behind ""The Secret""DVD."
2,"Good prospect, but a little dangerous","So I wonder, still. If the ""Law"" of Attraction is all about intent, and particularly about good or bad intent getting you exactly what you put out there -- as 'like begets like' -- then... what about all of the other creatures of nature? When something bad happens to them even though they've put nothing but 'good nature' out all about them? Isn't nature good? Are there actually good and bad creatures of nature, or just those we perceive as such? Are blue caribou good and wolves bad? Are doves heavenly and snakes devlish? Aren't they a few steps away from eachother in evolution? Have we come right back to the old lost religions, all over again [...]"
3,Not really anything new,The secret is not really a secret. It is kind of like positive thinking. I think we all really know the secret but just forget it sometimes. If you believe good things will happen to you..they will. The authors have the secret...they're making a lot of money off of us!!
5,A Reminder Of What I Use To Believe In,"When I was in my mid-teens until age 21 I thought a lot like this DVD. I know it works because it did for me then. But I went into the Navy at 21 and from that point forward I sort of forgot all about ""The Secret"". To be in the military you are trained to not think as an individual but as a team (for valid reasons). So now I am 47 and what do you know...it all came back to me. There are many other sources that explain the various ways The Secret comes to be, but I enjoyed this DVD because you have several living examples of how The Secret is a success! I recommend watching this DVD if you want to put your life in order. If you are genuine in making a positive life change...you cannot fail. Seek other sources for more education, but this DVD is a good place to start and get prospective. Some have mentioned it's a waste of money...their opinion. I don't agree. Good luck and much success to you all."
2,Story half told,"This book is the ""kids"" version of ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill.I personally do not think that one can think and desire money and mix it with emotion and magically 'poof' it shows up. I believe that whats said above combined with putting your plan in action is what makes it happen.I do not believe the brain has special powers (though I do know that we emit brain waves and people could sense our emotions) to make a car appear, but having the desire, faith and putting your plan into action in getting that car is what makes it happen.You be the judge."
3,The Secret,"Interesting psychology. Don't believe it can really cause good things to happen magically. It can point a viewer in the right direction to recognize good happenings in our lives. It held me spellbound as I watched it, but it was a little long to hold my attention."
2,dont waste your money,"we bought this expecting to hear ""secrets!"" ideas, and tips on our bringing more health, weatlth, and love into our lives. The ""secret"" is based on the think good thoughts, and good things happen to you! NEver ever think bad thoughts and no bad things will ever happen to you. there..I saved you the money to buy this thing. If you really insist, go to the public library, and RENT IT FOR FREE! Trust me, I am on of the most positive people in the world! I am extremely optimistic, I still have MS, and while I am not poor, I am not rolling in it either. Do parking spots appear because I expect them to? NOPE! Does money rain from the sky or cars appear because I stand and expect them too? NO! It is nice to use some of these principles to help you feel better about your life and help you guide your life into a better direction, but dont buy it expecting it to drastically change your life."
4,Much hyped but worth the buy,its not rocket science. thats the great thing about this dvd. most of this we all know. the problem many of us have is that we get into bad habits. watch and re-watch this dvd. it may help you kick those bad habits and get you back on the road to success. best of luck.
1,Nonsense,"While this had one or two truthisms, such as a positive attitude helps with success and healing, for the most part it is a repetitive and unconvincing piece of work on the theory of ""The Law of Attraction"" leaving you feeling cheated.If you want a real valuable insight into personal happiness try a 12 step program. I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews before purchasing."
4,I've got the Secret!,I bought one for myself. Then bought one for everyone I know for Christmas. Great message.
4,The Secret,"I enjoyed watching The Secret and it made me wonder about my everyday interactions. I am more aware of my ""being"" and the outcomes of my life. I definitely recommend the video and I'm glad I purchased it."
5,Excellent!!!!,"What an amazing revelation and inspiration. Every child, woman and man should be guided to watch this movie and live by its teachings. This movie will blow your mind and change your life. A must have!"
1,Doesn't even deserve THAT much,"Total and utter nonsense BS. Another ""self help"" ""method"" aimed at an overindulgent self-obsessed society, and the worst part. PEOPLE ARE BUYING IT?! Please, for your sake and the sake of human kind, don't be sucked into this nonsense. Don't succumb to laziness and selfishness.Only this that can be said for the lady who started this is that she really knows how to make money.'I guess there really is a sucker born every minuet. Or more."
1,Don't buy this because it is number one on the list...,Made a mistake by buying this dvd...waste of money and time...don't buy this dvd just because it is number 1 on the most popular list...i think a lot of people made that kind of mistake...this dvd is just stupid...telling people that they can achieve anything as long as they believe themselves...
5,I love the Secret!,"I first found this video at my local library. It helped so much with realizing how everything fits together, I wanted to keep it to watch over and over again. I'm so glad I found it on line! It has helped my personal perception of my environment."
5,this is a must for everyone,This book is for people who want to take charge of their own destiny. This should be played in school.
5,Must See!,Highly recommend to anyone! This is no self help crap but about the Law of Attraction & Einstein believed in it so thats saying something right there. Just get through the first half or so & everything will start coming together & being logical. You don't have to be spiritual or religious for this either!
5,"The Video Reinforces The Book - 2/13/13,.....","The CD is just very reinforcing of the book. Sometimes, for me in particular I can be more of a visual learner than a book learner. However, both book and CD really have their own unique interpretation or portrayal of ""The Secret"" and I would recommend both. There's a positive change coming! :-]]"
5,Excellent,"I could not be happier! It arived quick, it arived in excellent condition. I would buy from here again!"
5,LIFE CHANGING,"the book has changed my life, and the movie is even better. It has a lot of examples to better show you how the law of attraction works. For those negative reviews on this movie it's because the viewer doesn't understand how to apply the secret. but to each his own right?"
2,"Old stuff, new packaging","I heard about the laws of positivity and negativity attraction years ago. Old ideas. Good ideas, but nothing new. And the movie is more hype than value."
3,secrets review,"An excellent introduction into owning your own power. Perhaps a bit more onthe spiritial aspect would have been good, but it reaches the public, its a start."
3,The Age Old Secret,"Useful information, but its been around for years and is simply repackaged here in a different form. I'm not impressed with the constant repetition of how you can find your perfect mate, find the perfect job, or get rich. All fine goals, but good grief, do you really think that its A Secret? Go read the book Illusions by Richard Bach instead."
2,There is no secret.,"Like alot of people I feel I was suckered in to purchasing this product. Would I recommed it, absolutely not. The only secret is how much the author is laughing all the way to the bank and how they took an old idea, wrapped up in a new package and sold it to millions."
4,The Secret Review,"At first I was hesitant about theThe Secret (Extended Edition), thinking it would a waste of time. However, after the first twenty minutes their presentation started to make sense. The approaches they take have been used all over the world since ancient time. But it has had different names and has been taught differently.As a martial artist, I could see the similarities of this approach to martial arts especially the mental discipline.This is a great tool for mental development."
5,Great DVD,I really enjoyed this DVD. It is a big eye opener. I highly recommend it to anyone who might be interested in finding out the bigger picture of life.
5,LOVE!,I LOVE The Secret! This movie changed my life! This is a must watch for anyone who is truly seeking change their life by simply changing their thoughts :)
4,Useful insight on how to attain a great life,"The Secret contains useful information on how to channel positive thoughts to attain great things. It is true that our thoughts determine our feelings and feelings influence our behavior. At a first glance the process seems easy but like everything else it requires time to get used to thinking and feeling in an optimistic way, and to practice the little steps of the creative process. I would recommend watching the film several time to a get a good grasp of its message.However, I believe there's one very important thing this film is missing which is how to get rid of the emotional baggage that is causing the negative thoughts. Getting rid of insecurities, guilt and shame from the past is not easy and requires dedication, willingness and in many cases professional help. Thus, I believe The Secret can be extremely useful once an individual has unburdened him or herself of most of those old beliefs and is ready to soar!!!"
5,Very good Film,"Its very good film, I bought it for my friend on his birthday and I think it's one of the best presents you can make! This film you should see several time (7-10 times) to understand its really Secret and make it real."
2,Warning: Not The Original Version As Claimed,"Be careful when ordering this particular DVD from this vendor. I was hoping to receive the original (Esther Hicks) version as advertised and instead received the ""extended"" version which is significantly different."
4,Half of The Secret,"The Secret is more of a Self Development workshop than a movie or documentary. As a therapist and trainer with Australian Institute of Self Development I recommend it to many of my clients. It has a grabbing theatrical start showing the secret being being hidden, coveted and suppressed over the ages then settles into an explanation of The Law Of Attraction. Essentially it teaches how our thoughts create or attract whatever we focus on. Having used and taught Attraction for over 7 years it does work.However The Secret fails to give the viewer any effective means of changing limiting thoughts, beliefs and emotions and so is missing ""the other half of the secret"", so it's like a hot sports car with the transmission missing. For that you're going to need to learn NLP, EFT etc.Still The Secret is an effective tool to get this simple powerful concept out to the masses, and that it does very well. Russell"
3,WAS IT REALLY SUCH A BIG SECRET?,"Having read the Secret, I was not as disappointed watching the DVD since I like being able to put a face and voice to words in a book. Being well read in the wonderful works of Dr. Joseph Murphy, Louise Hay, John Gray, Wayne Dyer, and several of their contemporaries, I did not find the Secret to be the new revelation that marketing would like us to believe it is. If you are a fan of the aforementioned teachers, you may just find yourself thinking that you've been there, done that, and continue to do it having already learned the secret from others or even MOST IMPORTANTLY - from the teacher within yourself."
1,works like magic.........,"works like magic........You to can be the next Howard Hughes, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, James Arthur Ray....{To expound and propagate concepts is simple.But to drop all concepts is difficult and rare. NISARGADATTA MAHARAJ}"
4,Better than the Book,I thought that the information presented is better than the way it is presented in the book. It's a great tool for those already on the path of fulfillment.
5,amazing product,"if you are interested to change your life, look what is this material about, It's amazing and has a great teachings!!!"
3,Something is left out....,"I have manifested many things since learning about the law of attraction. I enjoyed the secret, but it leaves out one important condition. It tells you what you need to do to brings things into your life, but it never tells you how to do this. Read the book, ""excuse me your life is waiting."" It hits on all the same issues but it tells you how to attract things and most importantly how not to attract the things you don't want."
2,Repackaged Pseudopsychology - No Secret,"A friend and colleague read the book and said it really changed her outlook. I was hopeful that The Secret would at least be something new. It's not. Don't get me wrong, there is value in creating a vision for the future. Envisioning yourself succeeding, ""seeing"" everything down to the detail and tapping into what that successful ""future you"" has to ""say"" are all good practices to help you get where you're going. But the secret is, ""Its no 'secret'.""Unfortunately, like most repackaged self-help pseudopsychology/pseudo-metaphysics this puts a fancy wrapper on stuff people were writing about in the 1920s and before.An interesting question that this psychology fails to answer is ""Why then are so many miserable people successful, and so many successful people miserable?""Watch the first 10 minutes if you have AmazonPrime, otherwise move on."
1,Stupid,"Waste of money- all this is is common sense- you don't need to buy this to understand that if you think positively and do good things, good things will happeto you"
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie is just a total waste of time. The entire premise is based on unreasonable, unscientific, highly subjective, and quite ridiculous claims."
1,total waste of my time,"The title and rating ATTRACTed me to view this video. But five minutes into it, I found this is a total waste of my time."
5,Thankful,The best choice I made in my life this year because it has changed my life.Im grateful to have this information
5,Cannot play on my DVD player,"Love the message in this DVD, it is easy to follow with humour and clear explanations. We will all take what we want from this kind of thing, so those with more narrow minds may think it is rubbish but in my opinion that is their loss. I have used this kind of 'mind power' before with amazing results after reading 'The power of the subconcious Mind' by Dr. Joseph Murray. BTW the DVD does not play on my player, but plays on the laptop....but this is not a problem. ENJOY!!"
4,GREAT WAY TO LIVE YOUR LIFE,If you want to change your life this ia a very great way to start on your way to a more peaceful and happy life.
5,Simply Amazing,"Prior to viewing this film I had been searching for the answer as to how the successful become successful and rich. Rhonda and others answered my question precisely. This film explained simple steps for achieving total prosperity. I watch this film daily. I have purchased the book as well as other books that were recommended. Also, some of the information that I viewed in the film was a confirmation of what I had been thinking, therefore it gave support to my thoughts. Bravo! I give this film 5 stars plus. E. Roberts. PA"
4,If You Believe.....,"I read the book about a year ago and was non-plussed. It was small, short and glossy with a huge serving of elaborate graphics. The DVD is slightly different from the book in that it doesn't blame the Holocaust on the Jews or obesity on fat people as does the book. In fact, the DVD shies away from the ""group think"" message that if bad (or good) things happen to groups (airplane crashes, 9/11) that the entire group must have been on the same vibrational plane or wavelength.The book is all about individuals making their life better through visualization, goal setting and sending out their thoughts and desires to the Universe and letting the Universe give it to them.It's a ""feel good"" movie on one hand (""I can make it happen"") and, perhaps, a bit depressing on the other (""Why isn't it happening?"").Very high production values, splashy graphics - true eye candy. It's worth a look. Hey, it's only 90 minutes."
5,A must see for everyone!,"The Law of Attraction is working whether we understand it or not. I have to watch this almost daily, because I learn something new each time. I've just given my personal copy out, and now I have to re-order more. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to change their lives."
5,The Secret,"To those who have such an opinion on help aids and do nothing with it shame on you. This is again one of the best reigniting pieces of work that I have seen in a long time. It does tell the story of success and how wealth is truly made. I have heard in the past that ""A"" Students teach ""B"" Students to work for ""C"" Students (I think it was Napoleon Hill) and this way of thinking and living is a prime example. Not only thinking, but a secret that is yelling so loud that very few hear it, or too close to the trees to see the forest, and grasp it!Well done piece of art!"
5,Life changing,"I liked the movie better than the book, as a visual learner was so much easy to digest. If you can change your attitude, then you can change your life :) The Secret rocks!"
1,Biggest boondoggle of the 21st century,"Don't waste your money on this ""infomercial"" which merely serves to enrich the pockets of those interviewed. I didn't learn one practical thing - it's all theory. And sure, when something doesn't materialize, these folks are all full of rationalizations telling you where YOU went wrong!! Google the words Mind Power News instead and find the Mind Power News website and sign up for a free no strings attached 30 day Mind Over Money program which gives you concrete steps to follow--it's a program that produces results if you are interested in truly prospering. The real Secret is -- ""The Secret"" is a rip-off!"
1,I was duped,"the video version of The secret was 80% fluff and 20% substance- I was led to believe the video would tell all, but have since learned that it is only the first in a series of videos (Joe Vitale was on Larry King Live and said there will be others)- I didn't know I'd have to buy a series to learn the secret- I feel like I've been to used to contribute to the authors' financial happiness- I didn't see it coming"
5,The Secret to your key,"This is a movie that must be watched, heard, listened to and contemplated about in accordance to your current situation over and over again.Rae Ann Cicchi"
1,huh?,"How refreshing. Yet another attempt at convincing people that accountability is a thing of the past. If you have a bad or compulsive thought nagging at you and its not in your best interest, you may as well indulge your whim because you cannot control the mystical powers that are forcing you towards acting on your self destructive thoughts or habits.While it is true that a person is much more likely to achieve their dreams with focus and a positive attitude, I hardly think that it is a secret. Just good `ol common sense, motivation and attitude are required."
3,Good message,"It's not nearly as well done as the movie ""What the blip we know"". It makes me very happy that movies like this one are still being produced, but ""the secresct"" needed more elaboration."
5,Great marketing!,"Great marketing for an old idea-the power of positive thinking. That said, Rhonda makes no secret of the fact that philosophers and scientists have known about this idea for a very long time-it just needs new packaging for a new generation. I'm a little troubled by the people who think that this book and DVD endorses the idea of ""wishing will make it so"". They must have missed the part about your ""actions"" lining up with your thoughts. It's not just wishful thinking, it's being more aware of how you can sabotage yourself with negative thinking, and how you can become more powerful my monitoring your internal dialogue. Like any philosphy, you can take what works for you, and leave the rest."
1,"Common Thread ""Fraud""",Search the names of the people in the opening sequences and you will find a common thread between them. There is not much more needed to say than that
2,"Why is this ""Info-mercial"" so popular?","I watched about 10 minutes of this before I realized it was not a mockery.If you're into the whole ""believe it and it will become true"" nonsense, then this is right up your alley. Otherwise, look elsewhere for entertainment."
3,Can I say NLP?,"Nice, well produced and somewhat entertaining, if a little dramatic a times. But if you're familiar with the concepts of NLP / Tony Robbins etc, there's nothing new here. It's all about visualization, anchoring, framing, outcome based thinking etc.."
2,Cheesy,"This movie is very cheesy. It sends out a false message that you can get anything you want if you just wish it. Of course it doesn't go into detail that you have tomake it happen, work hard for what you want. It makes it look so ""easy"" just think about it enough and it will be yours.Ok. I believe that negative thoughts can bring negative energy, and good thoughts bring good energy and all that. However the movie could have been made more realistic.There are some good points in it, if you watch it long enough to get through all the B.S."
1,Don't Bother,"I can save you $30. Think positive, or how 'bout this...do unto others.This is really a suckers deal. Shame on Oprah. She must have a stake in it. This was a waste of time. There is no ""Secret"". Go to your library and check out the Power of Positive Thinking. This is nothing more than a rehashing of old ideas. You want negative thoughts? Buy this DVD.I guess I should have listened to my ""inner voice"" when I handed the sales clerk my VISA card."
2,Exactly what was expected.,"I used the Secret (both the book and this video) for a Wednesday night Bible Study at my church. We were doing a 10-week Cult Study. So, I chose the Secret for one of my resources while discussing the New Age Religion. It was exactly what I expected and was actually very clear regarding the ""gospel"" it is preaching. The basic line runs: you are in control, you control your destiny, you can even control your environment. One of the ladies interviewed actually said plainly, ""you are god."" You can't get much clearer than that. Nor can you contradict the Gospel of Jesus Christ more severely than that.

4,Thought Changing,This DVD spells out in detail a different way to look at your personal situation. Instead of sending thoughts that are negative out into the univere it instructs you to turn around the thoughts you are sending out into positive thoughts. In doing this the universe receives only your positive thoughts and then sends them back to you granting your wishes. When you think possitive it improves your whole outlook on life.
1,A Plea for Thoughtfulness,I beg people to be thoughtful about what they read. To toss off criticism of this book as negativity is cowardly. If as the author claims there is a scientific basis to the law of attraction please subject the idea to scientific scrutiny. Show scientific evidence that the message works. If converts decry this challenge and insist that articles of faith should not be scrutinized in the manner I would refer them to genuine philosophical sources like Saint Augustine who strongly encouraged that faith be carefully examined lest it wither in to nave supernaturalism and superstition. Reason is prone to error and so is faith. Both require careful analysis. Both are important as we were reminded in a recent Encyclical. Faith and Reason are the two wings upon which men ascend to the contemplation of truth. Both require thoughtfulness.
2,Positive Thinking Gets You a Long Way,"From a psychological point of view it is not easy to control and monitor your feels every second of the day. The film has great potential; however, I highly doubt the great minds of past and present never had a negative thought or feeling. Many people are motivated by failures and negative thoughts to do great things. The film does not cover this spectrum and I believe its loses its creditably."
3,The Secret,"It all comes down to perspective. Do you look at a glass of milk as half full or half empty? All this DVD does is suggest that you look at it as half full. It is true that the more positive approach you take towards life, the more positive your life will be. How-ever, It suggest that all thought becomes things (the laws of attraction) and that if you want something, All you need to do is ask the universe for it. While this positive outlook is certainly more healthy than the alternative, it is not actually realistic. If it were,I would have won the lottery by now. Dam the universe!"
3,Secret,"I think that you have to ""do something"" to make things come to you. It is inspirational anyway."
2,critically misleading,"There is truth in the power of positive thinking. But this video pictured a child receiving a new bicycle simply because he wished for it and an adult a sports car. I live by some of the principles discussed but I know for sure that you do have to work for ""things"". I looked forward to ""the secrect"" and was left totally disappointed. My husband and I have been succesful and I personally believe this video is misleading and unfair to a lot of those looking to it for strength. I advise watching it to form your own opinion. I have simply given my opinion."
5,The Secret,"Wonderfully done, beautifully coordinated. This is the answer to the question, ""How do I get what I want?"" This is the firm foundation on which to build your life, and how to accept and create the joy that life offers. This may be your first introduction or a reminder of things once learned but forgotten, either way it is a ""Must have"" for anyone on the spiritual journey of life."
1,salesmen,"this movie is a selling product for public speakers and motivational speakers. Life is simple, use what you have, whether it be a g-d given talent or something you have worked and practiced hard at. be thankfull and go to WORK. Life isnt fair, its life, its your choice."
1,This is the stupidest thing ever...,"If I could give it negative points, I would. Not only does it state the obvious, by beliving in yourself is the likely way you will succeed, but I find it damaging to popular outlook on life.The messege is, ""don't do anything about what's wrong in your life, instead believe it's wonderful and you will feel wonderful!"" Riiiight, like let's think global warming isnt real and that my tumor will heal itself without medical attention? And der, if I fool myself into thinking life is great and I'm having the best time of my life working 8-5 in a cubical and avoid all thoughts which could possibly be negative, then I'll be a blissful fool.Arugh, what a way to promote stupidy and inaction."
1,Could you be MORE gullible?,"Impossible to believe, except that the anti-intellectual forces in the US have been running rampant for years....this is absolute nonsense, whether or not Oprah or anyone else endorses it. So, to follow the reasoning of The Secret, the Jews who died in the Holocaust brought it on themselves with negative energy? And old Adolph himself must have been vertiably pulsing with positive energy? Cancer victims and AIDS patients bring on their own diseases due to their thoughts? And Donald Trump is filthy rich because he wished, very effectively, he was? No, although it might be comforting to think that all you have to do is wish for something and it will come true, Peter Pan is a fairy tale. The TRUE secret here is that Americans have become suckers for the ridiculous. Do NOT believe this nonsense, and don't perpetuate it. And yes, I am a very successful person in both my relationships and professional life. Exercise your brain, not your wallet!"
4,The Secret From a Biblical Point of View,I purchased the Secret with the intention of comparing the material in it to that which is found in the Bible. Not a surpise to me was the fact that much of what is said in the Secret can be traced back to the wisdom of the Bible.The teaching of the Secret recognises a universal law at work but not the creator of the law. Who is the God and Father of Jesus Christ.
4,Motivational,The book is very motivational indeed. I agree with its message of staying positive in your thinking.
2,Overblown 'What the Bleep' Wannabe,"I read the other reviews and started not to buy this. I should have followed my gut instinct. I really loved ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" and have watched it countless times. This movie is edited in the same style, with, I think, less qualified speakers. Anyway, it does not matter how much you think...even ""believe"" you will win the lottery, I didn't...I mean, you won't! To be fair and not incurr too much bad karma, it does have and make some good points, however too few to justify the price...and the hype.Learn from my mistake--get this for $1.50 at my next garage sale. It will be there and it's worth about that."
5,Nothing new yet packaged for our shortened attention spans,"Who cares...I believe in attraction and mindfulness. It can't be quantified like gravity but really, how could anything any of these people have professed in this movie cause harm. If you don't get it, you don't get it. It could cause I guess disappointment for someone who thinks they will have a Ferrari land in their lap if they visualize it for five minutes. The Law of Gravity you see immediately, the Law of Attraction simply changes your environment slowly. This really is cognitive behavioral therapy---event------>perception of event---->feeling----->behavior------->an environment attractive to that behavior=your life"
4,Take it for the positives.,"It's a good film, isn't very explanatory about how to get to ""The Secret"". I'm sure it's because there's just not enough time to do so in a film like this. I'd say that if other's ""poo-poo"" it, it's because they aren't willing to try to change there life for the better. But that's my assumption. Watching this has increased my income, so I am not going to complain!"
3,Too much Materialism,"I like the book for it's emphasis on positive thinking, but it was focused primarily on material gains rather than peace of mind. Some of the accomplishments set up unrealistic expectations.I had cancer 17 years ago. Was that my fault? I believe a lot can be accomplished with belief and hard work. NOT EVERYTHING can be accomplished with belief and hard work. PEACE OF MIND CAN be accomplished with belief and hard work."
2,The Secret,"There are some interesting ideas, but I did not like the sensational theatrics surrounding them. I wish I had bought the book instead --or maybe I should have skipped both of them."
1,How did I attract this?????,"If you have lived under a rock, never heard of Tony Robbins, Deepal Chopra..., never been exposed to any religious text or teachings, or positive thinking in general, never read a self help book, then this might be a ""secret"" to you. If it is, your DVD player is probably too complicated for you to be able to watch this anyway.If you enjoy e-harmony, or ""get rich with no money down"" commercials, you will love the feel of this ""movie"".If you are already on-purpose, of at least on the path, this will feel like pre school material.Buy ""As a Man Thinketh"" by James Allen, or ""Creating Affluence"" by Deepak Chopra instead of this if you need a start. Then move on to Tony Robbins.Oh yeah, I attracted this because a friend recommended it. I should have payed more attention to my instinct, and reviews like this one."
4,The Secret II . . . Coming Soon?,"This week on Larry King Live, he interviewed several contributors to The Secret. One of them, Joe Vitale, inadverdantly let it slip that a sequel to The Secret is in the works now. The tentative title will be something like, ""The Secret II: Taking Right Action""If that's the case, it will surely provide more answers and clarification to the questions and doubts many viewers are struggling with.The Secret embraces both Eastern and Wesern spiritualities. But the teachings pull largely from basic Buddhist (all sects) practices and beliefs - including reincarnation, the awesome power of stillness and utilizing unseen Divine-to-human energy systems.The Secret as it is, cannot possibly cover its intense and profound teachings in one, two, three - or more - books and DVDs. I suspect there's a lot more to come."
1,What a joke I feel like such a sucker,what a joke - I feel like such a sucker - warning warning not worth it at all - dont buy
2,So who is keeping the secret?,"Great trailer and theatrical storytelling. Very much in the same vein as DaVinci Code, but really they release no secrets. Disappointing there was not even a top ten checklist for this. A series of great ideas not fully explored, just things to consider, perhaps, well maybe.This is a clever marketing tactic to just tell you to get ready to buy yet another in the ""series"" of secrets. There are any number of motivational speakers that are just as ""revealing"" and really do give real-life lessons to realize and checklist your goals and desired change.Save your money and find the secret while you ""awaken the giant within"". But you didn't hear that secret from me - mums the word!"
5,The Secret,I really liked this cd. It gives you a lot to think about and how to change the negative thinking. I value The Secret as a sourceful self-help cd.
1,The Secret,"This is a lot of hype about nothing. Common sense tells you that a positive outlook on life improves our chances of success in anything we do. This DVD just states over and over that if you believe you will attain wealth or any other goal in life, it will happen. Nonsense. I had heard so many talking about getting this DVD or book, I had to try it. A positive step in obtaining wealth is to save your money instead of buying this DVD."
4,The Secret,"This is of course information we all know on some level. Being reminded of positive information in creative ways is always a good thing. We are now a very visual society so having this information in this creative form in my opinion is good, especially with the book to refer to."
3,The Secret - not that much of a secret...,"I bought this DVD because of the ""hype"" that it has created. While the content is certainly uplifting because of it's potential to create a positive attitude amongst those that see/listen to it, I did not find the material new. It's what has been taught by many a philosopher over the years. I also think that if you take the advice at face value, it has the potential to create false expectations."
5,Secret II - The Law of Polarity,"They will come out with the second version of this - because there is deeper work to do .... in the words of Debbie Ford ...""you can't put ice cream on poop"" - most of us have so much poop inside our heads that we need to address that first - trying to out muscle it doesn't work - check out her books:The Dark Side of the Light Chasers"
4,It could be more complete.,"The book, The Secret, goes more deeply into the work that has to be done in order to make the secret work. The DVD is wonderful, but needed togo more in depth. This is a study that is important, and we need all the help we can get."
5,Revelation,"This video will be a revelation to many, articulating beautifully what many have intuitively considered or experientially encountered. What one does with the information is entirely subjective, but it is hard to imagine anything other than a positive influence."
1,How to Get Rich,"Wanna know the real ""secret"" to making lots of money and being happy? Duping a bunch of New-Agers into paying money for a load of absolute poo. ""The power of positive thinking"" (quotes because it's the title of a very good book on the subject) has NEVER been a secret. If you want something badly enough you'll find a way to get it. But the so-called ""secret"" of this movie goes further than even that! It suggests that if you concentrate real hard on the Hope Diamond and really believe you can have it that it will appear in your living room!!! This is one of the stupidest cheap claims out there. John Edwards, Miss Cleo, and the makers of The Secret are only out there to take advantage of your beautiful willingness to believe and steal your money. Please, think positively and believe that you can achieve wealth and happiness in your life without spending money on this abyssmal film (or the book it was based on)."
4,outlooks from different perspectives,"If you practice manifesting or want to learn more about it. Thenthis is a really good movie. I first got this because a clienthanded me the movie. My wife, daughter and I sat down and watched it.It was pretty good. Most of the stuff you may have heard of before ifyou have read a personal development book; but they do give differentoutlooks from different perspectives. That is really the key tothe whole thing. The different perspectives. The core of this movie isthat what you think about you can achieve. I found that it does workas long as you add some massive action. All and all it's a great book- but make sure to put it into action or you will just waste yourmoney.Matt BacakAuthor of Secrets of the Internet Millionaire Mindand The Ultimate Lead Generation Plan"
4,ENJOYED GREATLY,"THIS WAS A GREAT DVD, BUT IT MOVIED SO FAST THAT THE BOOK HELPED ME TO GO BACK AT A SLOWER PACE AND REALLY LET THE INFO. SINK IN."
1,Law of Gravitation?,"Sorry, I was being facetious. This film works like a Tony Robbins infomercial meets fuzzy New Age philosophy. The so-called ""Law of Attraction"" is a double edged sword -- for everything you attract into your life, you are pulled back into someone else's gravity. Sometimes this is good, often it is not. Planets and suns operate under the laws of gravitation (the attraction of two celestial bodies to each other), but one body or the other goes slightly awry."
3,Positive... but,"It's a nice positive message, but the movie is a bit long and repetitive, and some things don't make sense. For example, they talk about being able to get ANYTHING you want, including health and youth, yet some of the interviewed people look old and fat..., for example."
3,It's not new information,"While I agree with much of what is said, it has been marketed beautifully, and fulfills the creators desire for wealth. Like attracts like, ""do unto others"", karma, the boomarang effect, it's all the same. If you look for the best in life, you see the best in life. Be optimistic!"
1,The Secret (Extended Edition),What a joke. A great lesson on how to take a meaningful concept and rape it for all it's commercial potential. I think that is the secret!I am disappointed.
5,The Secret to living your dreams,"""The Secret"" is a great introduction to the Law of Attraction. Anyone interested in achieving their life of their dreams could benefit from watching this a number of times. Even if you're familiar with spiritual laws the illustrations provided might help you see a new perspective. And if you're new to these principles, you can find one of the teachers that you resonate with and dig in deeper. Over all a great movie about living the life of your dreams."
5,Loved it!,"I watch this film over and over, especially when I begin to feel down. It reminds me to focus on gratitude and then my life starts looking better."
3,Too Much Hype - And Good Lesson At Same Time,"This hour and and a half documentary could have been summed up in a half hour.It goes on with all this intensity - and sound effects as if they are causing total world peace. A bit over blow. And they try to cite the 'National Enquirer' as a reputable news source. Comments also by James Canfield - co-author of the somewhat lame 'Chicken Soup for the soul' books. A very good documentary - but way too over-sold. Too intense, the music and sound effects - it's like watch an evangilist give tomorrows weather. Scott MacNeil"
1,Can't give zero stars,"You'll like it if you're really gullible and not very bright. Since you're probably not like that, just skip it."
1,Not even close,"Mind over matter has been a well known cliche for a long time. If this were true you would only have to think of an apple and it would appear. Grounded in reality, you'd starve to death before anything in this movie became reality. Bits and pieces of quantum reality has been blown out of proportions to make a dollar, or more clearly to use you - scam you into giving money for this. My criteria is altruism is best, and if someone knows a big secret that makes life better it would be free. As everyone knows, ''buyer beware.''"
1,Was painful to watch,I am grateful to see this movie has so many positive reviews as that means it has helped quite a few people accept the message that it brings. Personally though I didn't care for the movie. I would imagine most of the other 1 star ratings also convey my feelings.
3,not what I ordered,"I specifically searched for and ordered the DVD of ""The Secret (ORIGINAL EDITION WITH ESTHER HICKS) and I received what I already had: ""The Secret"" only. The DVD is good, but NOT what I ordered.It was NOT the edition with Esther Hicks."
1,Be Careful With Your Vibrations.,God help anyone who can believe this rubbish. When we belch or break wind we set up a vibration. Do we not have to be careful to set up the right vibrations in this way if we are trying to attract success?
4,Why all the buzz? This has been in books & videos for years.,"While the information is good, I don't understand why everyone is acting like this is groundbreaking. These teachings have been taught in tons of best selling works such as ""As a Man Thinketh"", ""The Great Within"", ""Message from a Master"",The Magic In Your Mind"", ""The Magic of Believing"" ""Think and Grow Rich"", ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"" not to mention anything by Neville, Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes, Earl Nightingale, Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Stuart Wilde, Louise Hayes and many others. I find their marketing of their product deceptive calling it ""The Secret"" and saying it's been hidden for ages until now. Baloney! The title should have been called,""Same Information, New Packaging."""
1,Very Poor Concept,"I read some of the bad reviews, but since I'm into motivational speakers and learning about self improvement I decided to try this DVD anyways. I didn't even watch till the end. It really was a waste of money. They talk to you like you're uneduacted---One example is speakers saying whatever you think about most that you desire WILL come to you because you want it so much...as though it just happens magically. They show a boy really wanting and dreaming about a bike and then finally getting it as a gift just because he thought about it so much. They didn't show the boy thinking AND working to get it. Just thinking about it and looking at a picture of it. As though your mind has the power to make things come to you without you having to do anything. It was very odd. They didn't even go into depth. You need ACTION and PRESERVERANCE in addition to thinking and focusing on what you want...but this was not at all conveyed...disappointed."
1,Please mail me $3 and all your dreams will come true.,"If you want something, you will have it, if you want it enough.I really want a sports car - granted.I want a sports car - sorry you dont want it enough.Am I Wrong?"
1,"Oh, good lord...","Was this whole thing worked up one night over cocktails on a bar napkin? There's no secret here, just a bunch of talk that, in the end, means nothing and gives nothing; least of all a secret. Yet somehow this warranted a book _and_ a DVD? Amazing.The secret here is that people have been bilked out of money for a lot of fluff and nonsense."
2,It's OK ...,"The SECRET is anything but that. If you believe in God, Allah, Buddah, and Jehovah, you already know the secret.Love all."
5,A Tribute to Avarice,"One of the best comedies I have ever seen. If a new car is the one thing that will make you happy and solve all your problems, this is the movie for you. My favorite part is when ""Chcken Soup"" Jack Canfield is speculating that he is now living the life that everybody dreams about. He seemed sincere enough. Of course it would never occur to him that he is trapped in a nightmare. Having such a thought would be ""Negative."" That is the message of this movie. Don't be negative, be materialistic!!Don't be scared away by the documentary's supernatural tone and trappings. There is absolutely nothing spiritual in this laugh-a-minute classic. Although mostly talking heads, this movie is never boring because what these people say is so side-splittingly hilarious.A Must See."
5,Uplifting and inspiring,"The DVD is basically all the people who contributed to the book saying word for word what the book says, so; if you're pressed for time or just can't seem to get through the book I highly recommend getting the DVD. It was kind of cool too seeing the actual people themselves deliver their messages of positive thinking and believing in it, it kind of gives it that extra push, like a little personal cheerleader telling you to give positive thinking a try."
3,The Secret,Incredibly enlightening and eye opening no matter what your religious beliefs may be. This book does an excellent job of presenting century old concepts into perspectives that are easy to understand and apply. Highly engaging and motivating.
2,Can YOU keep a secret?,"You probably already know the ""secret,"" and you will certainly know within the first few minutes of watching this video. This movie contains information that's been available for many years from various sources. There is really nothing new here. But, it's REALLY worth watching. Bottom line: I like this movie, but rather than buying it, I recommend borrowing it from a friend. If you ask around, someone you know already owns it."
4,Makes you want to read the book,This was a very stimulating DVD. It caused me to want to read the book to gain more nuances.
4,The Secret,My wife and I have watched The Secret 4 or 5 times and loaned it out twice so far. Great concept.
1,Self - motivating pie in the sky.,"Yes, if you're down, this DVD might lift your spirits and make you feel energized...but nothing more. It is a fairytale and a daydream."
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"What a waste of money and time all for the same old message in a new package. Run from this movie and the book, it will not give you the answers of life, it will only waste your time. I have never heard so much bs in my life as whats on this movie. I will sell mine on EBay I hope for whatever I can get."
1,Odd happening -,"The book is excellent, the video mediocre at best. I tried to send the book to my children, but the order was filled with DVDs. This seemed strange to me because I ordered ""Hardcover"" editions. They claim it was my mistake. Not the end of the world. Hugh Looker"
3,Never got it,The buyer contacted me to tell me it was unavailable and I was promptly reimbursed. No feedback because it was neither good nor bad. Bad that I didn't get the DVD but good that the buyer wrote to tell me and gave me a refund without me asking.
5,A MUST SEE!,"I rented the movie first from Netflix...why not? I am paying for a membership, right? Well, it was SO GOOD that I bought the DVD that day. Not only did I buy one for myself, but I bought 2 additional copies and sent them to my best girlfriends. I have watched it 3 times within the past week and I am sure I will watch it again tomorrow. The first time I suggest you just sit back and take it all in. After that, be ready with paper so you can take notes. I have learned something new every time I watched it. It really has changed my outlook on life. There is power in positive thinking and the Law of Attraction. A must BUY, not just a must see! Oh and I glanced at the book in the store...it is the same as the DVD, but to me not as powerful as someone talking to you."
3,The Secret,"I thought the basic premise was good. It was a bit staged and a bit longto state one basic principle ""The Law of Attraction"". Interesting to watch. Gave food for thought."
3,The Secret is to start early in life,"To train your mind at a late time in your life, seems to be a constant battle. I believe in the concept, I am going to keep an open mind. Maybe if you watch this a few hundred times you may ""get"" The Secret. I believe it may work if utilized the way it is to be intended."
4,Secret review,"This DVD contains a lot of practical information about how to begin to take responsibilty for the state of your life. I'm not sure I buy into all the ideas, but the overall idea of gratitude can make all the difference."
3,The Secret,"I believe the power of advertising has propelled this book and dvd into the top best sellers. I was very disappointed in the overall message. The power of positive thinking has always been my guide for a successful life, but the message they are giving is too extreme and is the way for the author and the message givers to extract more money from the gulible viewers."
1,88 Minute Hot Air Balloon Ride,Everything has been said before...and the info in this redundant 80 minute infomercial could have been stated in half the time. Overblown and over hyped film of something that is common sense.
3,An honest open minded review,"I swallowed my ego and watched this after the persistence of a friend his message ""a single good point would be worthwhile"". I watched it, and while they were times when i cringed in pain in hindsight - there is a positive message been shared and I would recommend this to people who have started their inner search. People who are depressed, unhappy and clueless about their lives, it is a starting point for them. Helps one believe in their own abilities. The basic premise I took from it, ""If one is focused with a positive attitude and keeps at it, surely they will succeed"". Yes nothing new here, but a different way of reinforcing and drumming home the point."
4,Secret,"Took a little longer to recieve it than I had thought. It got delivered to the wrong address or someone took it I don't know. I emailed them and they got right back to me. Sent me another one which I recieved in a couple of days. Good quality DVD, customer service from amazon was good same with the dealer."
4,Extrapolated What I Wanted,"Overall, it was great for daily application. I too see positive results. Many of these philosophies and principles I was already aware of and believed - it was a reiteration of sorts. I didn't agree with each statement, so I mental substitutions when neccessary."
5,Amazing life philosophy,"The ideas and inspiration included in this DVD could change the world! What can possibly be wrong with the notion that we are what we think about? That we create our own realities, and that the only thing we can really control is how we think? Personal responsibility is taken to a new level here, and it is refreshing and desperately needed in today's world. While I find Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting, one of the best books ever written on this subject, I think The Secret will expose this philosophy to millions of people who will not be able to ignore their power any longer!"
3,Keep in mind...,"The point is the secret can be boiled down to a 30 second sound bite, but since they want to sell videos they hammer the point home by making it appealing to the most people using the magic 4, money, sex, power, God. Don't lose site of the simplicity of the message because you don't like the messenger.I liked it it reminds us to be thankful for what we have and to be positive."
5,Inspiring,An excellent movie if you are willing to see things in a different light then your used to. Enlightening for people open-minded enough to accept it for what it is.
5,I Found this video to be useful both mentally and inspirationally!!!!,"This video helped me to focus on what I needed to change in my mind to be a much better person for my family and for myself. It helped me grow into somebody that I want to be rather than somebody that I can't stand. There are many things in this world that can help with your spirtual sense, but when you see it in action with the people that believe in the Secret you can tell that they have overcome all the down trodden emotions that people experience everyday.When you mind is at ease you are at ease. Thank you to producers in creating this work if it doesn't work for success it will work with emotions and the mind. I really appreciate the fact that these people that are on this movie took the time to give us the tools to change."
5,Excellent,It's really quite complete. The response to some of the criticism is found in Byrne's second book The Power where she takes time to equate the process with love.Either way the Secret movie if you pay attention addresses the concerns. What I find interesting its its inferior intellect and inferior experience that can't see what is good in this offering. Its people who take their low bar lives to be a benchmark that have a negative take on the movie. Its excellent.
1,NO SECRET,BALDERDASH ... In a few words .. tripe that has been debunked ... a total waste of your time ... and certainly money !
2,like the book better,found the book to be a bit better for me because the people in the DVD struck me as odd.
4,"""The Secret"" DVD","This DVD is very compelling to watch and learn about ""The Secret"". I haven't read the book yet, but I liked the way the DVD was put together. All the presenters are very engaging speakers."
3,"Good movie, poor recording","The movie was complete and appeared to be in new condition, but the digital recording is jumpy and makes it difficult to watch. I'd seen the movie previously so I just need it to listen to as a reminder, more than anything, otherwise I would have returned it. In general it's a movie worth watching if you haven't--just try to pay attention to the non-materialistic portions. This movie is a bit heavy on the money part of wealth and happiness."
3,overrated. something better out there,"people would learn more if instead of this, they bought ""the secret behind the secret.""this was included in only the very first printing of ""the secret.""there was a copyright dispute.but this part is actually the real deal.it is by jerry and esther hicks,i believe."
3,Unfortunately brutal,"Interesting concept, but seriously flogged to death in what seems like an eternity. If you need motivating or are incredibly depressed this might work for you (I can't think why else you'd want to see happy people saying the same thing over and over again).Wouldn't mind seeing someone try a ""Secret for Idiots"" 10 minute summary being circulated for free on the internet, but then again, that's why this was made...... easy money on a lot of hype.Curious why [...] seemed so enamoured with this - but maybe she was raving about the book."
3,A feast for the eyes,The trailer for the DVD is incredible. The content defines the book. The interviews of the presenters are well done and classy. the method is convincing and encourages the viewer to watch numerous times.Great for those of us who rather watch then read!!
3,Good motivational video,The power of posative thinking has always interested me and this video simply supports my belief that you can influence the things around you. Good for those who do or can believe in this philosophy.
4,"Good Info, Cheesy Presentation","There is a very infomercial feel to the DVD, and the information is pretty consistent with lots of other material out there on the same subject. It's a good watch but you can't take it all too seriously, the examples and claims made are a bit much and if you have a room full of people there will no doubt be a 'heckler' or doubting Thomas in the crowd to make some comments.There is some good advice to take to heart though, and if you apply the attitude and intentions you should see an impact on your life, but you can't expect anything like the claims in this DVD to happen. They need to add a little bit of reality to this show in order for it to be taken more seriously, but overall I feel inspired after watching it."
1,Wow. You idiots will believe anything.,You accept claims without evidence. You don't search for truth on your own because you are lazy. You are so desperate that you will believe anything that makes you feel good and worthy. You are mindless shells who are easily guided.
1,Worthless.,"I had a lot of trouble with this video. I tried to take it seriously, and I tried to give it a chance, but the more I watched and heard, the more disgusted I got. Positive thinking is a hugely powerful thing, but this is like a bad joke gone wrong. It's time to come back to reality and take a heavy dose of pragmatism.The only ""secret"" here is the secret of how to make a lot of money by selling people a lot of ""feel good"" BS. I imagine it's working wonderfully for the authors/creators, while they enjoy our hard earned money."
2,The Secret,"There is no secret here. Books like the ""Power of Positive Thinking"" have been around for decades. The secret is to write another book on the subject, but not coming up with anything new or novel. Just another gimmick to make money off the vulnerability of people. The secret has always been to remain positive and optimistic. Duh.Real Scientist"
2,Good production but no secrets revealed,"This is all old hat. I can think of several books that suggest the very same ""secrets"". Some suggestions are far fetched and I shook my head in disbelief. That aside production values are high. This is a well done compilation of speakers and some famous quotes thrown in for good measure.There is some annoying repetition, the same idea is said in ten different ways as if the speakers are addressing some nit-wits. The bottom line is that this DVD is well made and well marketed (as is the book) and hence all the hype."
2,"Nothing New, Not well made","My wife loved the ""Opera"" show about The Secrete so much that we both wanted to get the video. We were expecting more information about the author's personal story but instead the video is made up of shots of the speakers giving their speeches and it comes across as a low-budget documentary.The production is so poor that it's hard to watch it all the way through (cheesy, repetitive and sometimes boring). The content is very similar to original ""universe"" thinkers such as Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich"".If you've never explored self improvement products maybe this could help, if you can sit through it. This is not worth the $29 in my opinion. Get it used at a discount if you really want to see it. This is just a money making/marketing gimmick with no real applicable answers to the curiosity generated by the Opera show(s). This is pure marketing with no real value."
1,I wouldnt recommend,"when I received the DVD it looked to be in good shape, however it skips pratically the entire movie, making it impossible to watch."
1,History rewritten by a pseudoscience cult,Historical recreations are shown. Vague new age philosophy amounting to make a wish and you will get rich and happy. Famous people of old implicated in unproven allegiance to this schizophrenic pseudoscience. About as believable as the Force in Star Wars with as many followers and same nonsense without results. Perfect for dull cult of Oprah followers.
3,I ordered the wrong item,"I thought I ordered the book. But the movie helped me save some time. The movie is still good and inspiring. It has its funny scenes. I just hoped they would have it in spanish as well, now i have to look for the spanish version"
5,Now I know the Secret,"First I purchased the book, then the DVD. The DVD can be watched over and over. Easy read; Highly motivational. Heartwarming. Life changing."
1,If it's so great give it away.,"If the secret is so great and powerful then _GIVE IT AWAY_. Publish it for free, everywhere, for everyone. If you're a master (or mistress) of the *SECRET* you certainly won't need the MONEY from the sales of books, DVDs and copyrighted materials. If you, the author or instigator of these presentations, are so in tune with the powerful creative forces of the universe then you can actually afford to pay to produce these products yourself and give them to those in need of your enlightenment. You could even afford the postage. Just give them away for the good of all mankind. But above all, do anything EXCEPT prey on people's need for hope. But, having said that, I do have to acknowledge that it IS a time tested, rock solid way to make money. Maybe that's the real SECRET."
3,"Worth watching, but I'm not convinced","I think it's worth watching since it presents a lot to think about, but IMHO, I think it's a bunch of BS. Mind overr matter, friends :)"
3,Nothing New,"It's not bad; it's just that after all the hype I expected something new, fresh and exciting, and I did not get it. The packaging of the product is innovative but the ideas are not. Motivational speakers (and mothers) have been saying the same things for years. I also was not impressed by the string of ""experts"" paraded across the screen. However, if your mother never taught you that your attitude to life determines the quality of your life, you can learn something from this video."
5,The Secret DVD,"I purchased this DVD for myself and my wife, after watching it we ordered one for each of our children. ""The Secret"" is something everyone can understand and use regardless of your current situation, successes etc. We actually stopped the movie several times to comment, that we knew this was true from past experiences....I would recommend that everyone have the DVD and watch it over and over and over."
2,"Hmm...interesting, but at the same time kind of rediculous","Now granted, I have only seen the first half or so of this film, but I watched it and now know the ""secret"":THE SELF-FULFILLING PROPHESYEssentially, the movie features dozens of people reiterating over and over about how ""what you are thinking about becomes reinforced and determines what you will become"". Perhaps this is an astonishing idea, but it is a pretty basic psychology concept. This isn't to say that the idea doesn't have merit, because attempting to filter your thoughts - be optimistic - will affect your behavior and experiences, but the film was just too hokey and ridiculous. Everyone referred to this concept as ""The Secret"" and made it seem like the best thing ever. Maybe this would be interesting to you, but it was a bit too preachy for me, and seemed like it was made for people who easily conform and have no prior ideas about a concept like self-fulfilling prophesy."
2,Not buying it,"I guess there are some good ideas in this ""new movement""; for example, positive thinking never hurts and being grateful for what one has is a good thing. However, blaming victims for their misfortunes is ridiculous. What about the victims of 9/11? Did they collectively exist on a ""bad frequency""? What about the kids who are victims of sexual predators? Jessica Lunsford, Samantha Runnion, Polly Klass, etc. Did they bring that on themselves? It would be nice to think that we control our destinies, and to a certain extent we do. But it is a false sense of security to think that we have control over every aspect of our lives.Take the good advice from ""the secret"" and do with it what you will. If it makes you feel that you are a better person then your world might be a better place for it."
1,ha,"i've only seen the preview and I must say that if you need a bogus dvd telling you ""the secret"" to success...wake up call: you're lack of will, confidence, and intelligence are the only things in your way.but i guess the weak-minded need some hope and inspiration once in a while."
1,Are they serious?,"I saw this at a friends house, although admittedly, we just saw parts of it, because while this was hilariously funny, it was also utterly boring. A complete waste of time. Please people, use your mind, and leave this one where it belongs...."
2,"oversimplified and hyperbolic, but it couldn't hurt","For lifelong losers who respond well to slogans and soundbites, this video is truly the answer to life, the universe, and everything. For intelligent, happy folks who already know the golden rule, The Secret is a nice reminder of the benefits of good karma and positive thinking, wrapped in a shroud of melodramatic mysticism."
5,excellent service,"I ordered 5 DVDs from this company. When I received them after 4 or 5 days, one of them was a bad disc. I emailed the company about this problem and was informed that I would be receiving a new DVD in the mail soon. It arrived within three days. I give this company 5 stars for reliability and promp service."
1,disappointed,"i am so disappointed because i am not able to open any of the 3 cd's kindly help me as to what i should do,"
2,The Big Secret Before You Buy: It Doesn't Play on Computers,"I was excited to watch the DVD, and very disappointed to find that it won't read on computer drives. It gives a message, ""Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because the disc prohibits playback in your region of the world. You must obtain a disc that is intended for your geographic region."" What is this? a bootleg version? I did get to play on a friend's home-theater.The movie itself is a little corny with use of stock-footage, such as a a romantic couple eating strawberries on a picnic blanket or Alladin releasing the Genie. There is also some ludicrous conspiracy theory that the ruling powers and free-masons over the years have keep ""the secret"" from the public. In spite of all this, the movie reveals profound insight, is a good beginning into the Laws of Attraction, and is inspiring to change your life- if you believe. I do."
1,Worthy of a Burger King tie-in,"How was the producer ever able to secure the participation of so many competing self-help product-peddling marketers and bring them together under one superstore roof called ""The Secret""?What a line-up of ""teachers."" Joe Vitale, ""metaphysician."" Michael Beckwith, ""visionary."" John Demartini and Bob Proctor, ""philosophers."" These titles appear to be misnomers when you check out their actual credentials. Their Web sites make them seem like ... well, something less than spiritual teachers.At the affiliated online superstore -- dear God! (and, yes, the link is ""Secret Superstore"") -- one can buy genie lamps and gratitude rocks [note to self: start selling stones from driveway]. Did I miss the Burger King tie-in?How dare they abuse the good names of the Buddha, Emerson, etc., in this grotesqueness.I don't disagree with the idea of the ""Laws of Attraction."" That's old stuff. However, this particular application is the very definition of crassness."
2,Interesting concept...,"I bought the DVD - it was OK. It took a few times to actually sit through and watch the whole thing. (I found it a little bit boring.)It makes things almost ""too simple"" and although they say things just ""work itself out"" I just feel that more planning needs to be involved in actually getting what you want.Otherwise, I do like the positive message it sends. I do like the idea of the law of attraction and I am looking into reading more into that."
4,If you have Experienced it ..then you will get the meaning,"To fully enjoy what is being presented here as a ""secret"" you need to have the life experiences to build on. We are given hints of this ""secret"" in our daily life and this DVD helps you to multiply those. Very helpful for anyone who wants to start a social or environmental entrepreneurial venture. As in my own case I started an organic tortilla chip company in the shape of a Whale's Tail that gives 10 percent back to ocean conservation. The principles in the ""secret"" have helped me to overcome difficulties in this rewarding startup business."
2,a documentary of a religion,"I watched this because it looked interesting. I can sum up this movie in one sentence though, and I'd already heard the sentence, so watching it was a waste of my time I feel. This sentence is: Think positively and positive things will come to you. This documentary is an embodiment of this sentence in a religion for people who don't already have one. And I don't have anything more to say about it than it was well-done for what it is."
2,Not what it advertised,"I ordered this particular DVD specifically because it said Esther and Jerry Hicks were in it. They were not and I was most dissapointed. I know that there are two versions of ""The Secret"" - one with, and one without the Hicks' Please make sure you send the right one next time!"
1,Don't Be Such A Bunch Of Suckers,"I can sum up the attributes of this book up in one sentence -- ""Don't focus of negative thoughts for they'll create a defeatest enviorment with which you'll live."" Very true. Now for the rest of what is espoused I have a few other comments. Utter nonsense. Pandering panacea. Wishful thinking. New Age drivel. An insult to anyone with a logical mind. Easy answers for a self absorbed generation. There is such a thing as circumstances in life. If someone experiences tragedy it isn't necessarily because they brought it on themselves. It someone has a stroke of luck it isn't because they're more enlightened. If all it took was focusing on what we want in order to get it everyone who walked into a casino would walk out a winner. This program is a make believe solution for taking control of your life. You want to take contriol of your life? Stop reading stupid junk that sells you a pipe dream and work on making yourself more productive."
1,The Secret? _The Power!_,"Positive thinking is good but goes only so far.Goodness is good but goes only so far.Now receive the power of _The Power! What it is, How to Get it--Now! How to Release it_.It's found here at Amazon. Search for: The Power! James Bramlett"
2,"Change your thoughts, change your destiny","It has a powerful message about how to change ones thoughts, however I don't really think the concept is anything new. Its very positive, but felt that it was a little supferficial and it's over priced.I would recommend watching it, but not worth buying."
1,Never got this Movie really caint rate it,I Never got it Please check for me Thanks.It Looks really good but i would still like to receive it.
2,No secret.,"Something that has been well known for millennia can hardly be labeled a secret.Manifestation, as presented, has been highly simplified and dumbed down for the masses.On a positive note, ""The Secret"" has surely created a lot of revenue for the producers."
2,Very Elementary Teaching,"The Movie is about a Secret - a secret that's been around so long that it isn't a secret. Many, many teachers, ministers and writers from Buddha and the Bible to our modern day sages, all have told us the same things. This information is of a very elementary nature so if this is your first exposure to this type of material, it is enjoyable. If you have traveled on your spiritual path for a while, you may feel as I did, that the whole movie runs like an infomercial."
3,"Positive message, but sometimes shallow","The overall message of this DVD is quite positive and helpful--basically, people should spend their energy focusing on the positive things in life. As this happens, you are more likely to actually see more of those positives, and stop the downward mental spirals of pessimism, depression, negativity, and misery. However, there are some very shallow messages about happiness coming from materialism. I.e., the more you focus on some material goal you want in life (like a bigger salary or a new bike) then suddenly you will find yourself getting. The ""Law of Attraction"" will automatically bring you those things that you focus your mind on. It's like a 'power of the mind' message. And the more things you have in life, the happier you will be...so think of those things and they will come to you. Sometimes the DVD's presentation of this concept is even quite silly and far-fetched."
5,We all have The Secret,"I have the book and the DVD. I have shown then Book and DVD to friends, and now I can't get them back. Once one perons borrowed the DVD and another borrowed the Book, all my friend have THE SECRET, which make good positive energy around me. All my friends have said, they feel like a better person knowing THE SECRET!"
5,THE SECRET IS OUT,"I FOUND THIS DVD TO BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL FOR NOT ONLY HELPING MYSELF, BUT TO SHARE WITH OTHERS. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME...AND IT'S REALLY SIMPLE IF YOU APPLY YOURSELF."
5,Thought provoking; life changing,"A wonderfully done movie; The law of attraction has never been explained and taught so well. The only negative is toward the end, a New Age viewpoint is mentioned regarding humans being divine. This New Age viewpoint conflicts with a Christian's belief that God lives within us if we have accepted Jesus as our personal saviour. It is not necessary to agree with the New Age view in order to gain a great deal of insight from this excellent lesson in applying the Law of Attraction to your life."
4,The Secret Book on CD,"I really enjoyed The Secret on CD. I took it on vacation and it made a long drive fly by. I think having the book on CD makes it easy to check in with it, so if your having difficulties in one area you could play that chapter and refocus. I hope that everyone can employe the law of attraction to their lives, I personally believe that it works."
4,Worth seeing,Putting aside the special effects of the Da Vinci Code and all the whispering (what are they saying?) there is a lot of inspiring information here - Jack Canfield has always been one of my favorites (pre-Chicken Soup)
4,Spreading the Secret,"It was a good program. Could get a person started down a different path. I am technically challenged and had trouble figuring out how to get out of the trailer into the main story,,,but that is probably not the fault of the dvd. And I finally did get to the rest of the story. The presenters were interesting and convincing."
3,Secret Visual,"The secret movie was not what I thought it would be, but I enjoyed it all the same. I own the audio book and the movie is basically just the very same dialogue of the book, minus Rhonda Byrne speaking. I've been using the law of attraction and it works, although its not always easy to think positive, it helps when you think that negative thoughts only invite negative things; something we all know anyway."
3,speedy; doesn't play in my xbox had to watch it on my PC,"The product was sent almost instantly after ordering it, which is much appreciated. When I recieved it I attempted to play it in my living room where my large flat screen is. I use an XBOX 360 to watch movies but it wouldn't play. Up to this point I've only been unable to play burned movies with my XBOX. Either way, I was able to watch it on my computer so all was not lost."
4,okay but package dented,"The DVD still works but was packaged in same box with Kinitrex and Food Mill.As a result, the pointed edge of the Kinitrex punctured the case of the DVD (The Secret). The DVD still works, but I was disappointed that I was giving it in in a case which has a hole/dent in it."
5,the secret,my daughter loves this movie so i ordered it for her she really enjoyed it so glad i found it
5,WOW,This presented some very powerful and insightful ways of viewing and interacting with the world around me. It has certainly changed the way I think about things.
3,The Ultimate Infomercial,"This is simply a self help movie with cool special effects. It's worth watching (or even just listening to in the background) yet whether you'll get anything out of it depends on how receptive you are to self help programs. I would say it's not worth buying though. It does as most programs of it's kind focus heavily on financial gain so if you're not motivated by money it'll seem more like a load of bunk. It's ideas are really all about positive lifestyle and attitude, which is not much of a secret."
4,"A MUST Watch for the ""New"" Seeker!","If you are just getting into spirituality and positive ""vibes"" then this is a GREAT movie for you. The super negative reviews that say it's all a bunch of BS (so to speak), are simply from those who haven't truly understood the message. They do not believe that ""thoughts create things"" and so they review the movie poorly. Also, it's not the right fit if you are already well on your spiritual path, but that does not take away from the great impact this movie CAN have on those just getting their feet wet. :) I would, however, recommend adding books likesomething like God: Six Weeks to SpiritualityandThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenmentto your arsenal, so that you are not limited by a lack of information. :)"
3,"Cheese, Anyone?","The Secret is an incredibly cheesy movie about the law of attraction, mainly, if you think about it hard enough it will come to you. Although the main concepts presented in the movie are for the most part correct, the ""whys"" they insert behind the concepts are questionable. Also, the whole idea of the thing being a ""secret"" is a hoax meant to invoke curiosity. It is so full of cheesy nonsense that it is hard to take the thing seriously, especially when they have ""visionaries"" talking about it. Overall, though, the concept can't hurt and isn't exactly WRONG.I wouldn't buy it again, but it was ok."
2,Watered down version of Law of Attraction,"The first, original version of ""The Secret"" is far more superior to the new extended version. For in the original, Esther Hicks, speaking for Abraham, shows us the principles behind Law of Attraction. The producers of this film decided that the general public weren't ready to hear this message, so they deleted Esther out of the film, and re-made it, with a watered down version. The problem is, without an understanding of how this powerful law works, it leaves the viewer thinking that ""taking action"" is the way to go...where Abraham has stated clearly, ""All the action in the world won't amount to anything, if you haven't lined up your energy. I reccomend the book: Ask and it is Given and or attending any of the Abraham seminars."
2,Good information but a bit hoaky,"This DVD is entertaining but a bit too hoaky, almost informercial like. I do like the message and point but it's a bit much! I watched it once and got rid of it since I don't think I could handle a second viewing!"
4,"Simple, powerful and at your disposal","I must say that I never gave The Secret a chance. I'm not much of a reader and I learn more visually than any other way. After watching this, I must say it's a good watch, however it isn't anything out of the ordinary or new. The aspect in which it is presented is clear and simple, yet because of that people will question it. No one now a days will give something a try if it seems to simple, there needs to be a catch or some sort of method to it other than what's presented. Just give it a try, be more positive and focus on what's good, not bad. I give it four stars, simply because I was already aware of the idea."
2,Bad promo for a good concept,"I so wanted to have a ""The Secret"" party because I believe in this concept so much. If you do too, find another channel to explore it. Positive thinking is a wonderful concept. ""The Secret"" is nothing more than a money making scheme for the writer/s. It talks about money more than how to attract happiness. I found it unrealistic, boring and more like an infomercial offering the end all be all hype. Get rich quick bogus schemes. They've taken a wonderful concept, and turned it into a hoax. I was so excited that I bought the extended edition and the original. Stop it, please. Stop messing with peoples' lives and wasting our time."
2,If you've ever been part of a 12-step program...,"This book and CD are simply the elements of any 12-step program. I watched Oprah today and sat there nodding at everything I've learned in my own 12 step thingy...So for those who have addictions, predilections, negativity, etc...join a 12 step program, pay a dollar a meeting and save yourself the cost of this stuff. It's all out there--virtually free for anyone who wants to get off something harmful and find serenity and happiness in life.If not? Spend the money and enjoy the same ride!"
5,The Secret,This is the best money I have ever spent. I watch this dvd every morning. It makes my day. I am buying 20 of them for Christmas gifts for my friends. Merry Christmas!
3,my opinion,"The video's content and message is good. The format is a little bit too exagerated, in my opinion. The message is useful and powerful but the film setting is too intense even stressful."
3,The Secret DVD,"As always, I received this order promptly from Amazon in good condition.However, I was disappointed in the DVD Content itself. And maybe that is because of my own misunderstanding of what the DVD was about.I had expected the DVD to be about The Secret in movie format. Thought I might see people living and applying the secret.However, it was just the authors reading the content of the book to you. So, either read the book or watch the DVD. Don't really need to do both."
2,Leaves out alot,Alot of information is left out. You can't just wish form something and it appears. You have to take action and work for it to make it happen.
2,offensive,"Generally, an offensive, hard-sell presentation of potentially useful information. Positive thinking and gratitude are good and healthful practices, but the so-called secret encourages readers/viewers to identify with consumerism and overindulgence as if that is the focal point of life to which we should all aspire when such practice, in reality, can only lead to further disatisfaction when more is not enough- and, truth be told, it never is. For a practice with lasting rewards, read ""God Without Religion"", which offers techniques for freedom from dependance on false securities along with a philosphy of self that is inclusive of all humanity."
5,Money Well Spent...,"I've always been told that ""thought creates reality"", but never really took it too seriously until recently. Now I've seen it happen. You create what is your life. I'm telling people about this movie, the simplicity of it. Sure we're all here to learn our own ""lessons"", but this is like being given the answers to a test ahead of time. You can change your life! Yes, I'm metaphysical in my beliefs, being that there's more than we're being ""told"". I wanted answers, real answers not just made up ones to fill in the blanks. This simple to understand DVD will change your life....if you let it."
3,only half the answer,"Pretty much everything said in this movie is true. However, the way that the law of attraction is presented struck me as base and superficial at times, and might very well appeal to our lower selves. Many speakers in the movie made it seem as if their primary goals were to simply realize material wealth. In my humble opinion, there are much more worthy pursuits that we should dedicate oursselves to."
3,A intro to those curious about Law of Attraction,"If you seen ""What The Bleep..."" this has a simular feel. This dvd should be used as an introduction and to help encourage those who are drawn to the possiblity of the ideal behind the Law of Attraction. Uplifting but does not clearly go into details about how to apply application of this Law."
4,The POWER of BELIEVING,"I purchased The Secret after I seen it on Oprah. I've never done that before - bought something I seen on TV...but the Law of Attraction is such an interesting concept. Simple, but interesting. I'm very glad that I made this purchase because each time I watch it, I learn something new. This DVD is not something that you'll watch once,put on the shelf,and forget about. It captivated me, and anytime I'm feeling doubtful or overwhelmed with anything in my day to day life, I pop it in the DVD player, and it helps me to put things in perspective. The Secret is practical and relevant - to EVERYBODY."
3,Nothing that has'nt been said before,I gave this DVD 3 stars only because of the presentation. Good merchandising. It is probably good for someone who has never heard we are what we think. However it is a good positive motivator for all of us who slide back into negative thinking. Now if there could be a magic wand that could keep us on the up at all times that would be something. This DVD does not have it. The same thing can be read in the book for alot less money.
4,The Secret,"This DVD is a eye opener. For people fighting depression this will help. Stop thinking with the devil and think with the genies, in other words think positive instead of negative and the positive will win everytime."
2,secret to capitalistic gain?,"i have to agree with others about the capitalist end of this video. the fact that most people in the video were wishing for things versus spiritual quests was a bit annoying. i laughed out loud at some of the scenes, especially the uberdramatic 'historical' scenes- hysterical is more appropo. get this video is you need something to achieve shallow self expression- you may get what you want!!the person who was commenting on the boy wishing for a bike was exactly on target! why didn't the kid 'work ' for it? i suggest the book parenting with love and logic to have that kid see what the true meaning to life is-you want it? you work for it!good luck to those seeking positive vibes from this dvd, at least the premise is positive if not farcical!"
1,This is not the original material and I am sorry I bought this...,"This not the same as the original and it leaves out some of the ""how to"" aspects and examples.I regret that I purchased this item. I bought this for a gift which I won't give now.This version is now very superficial.It is not the same as the original and I didn't realize it before I purchased.I made the mistake of getting the book too and that is also a revised edition.My suggestion is to save your money and get the original Edition online.I am really disappointed in these revised items, especially since the original was so very good."
5,i seen the light!!!,my husband and i recomend the secret to anyone who has ever wondered how to get their life on track or wondered how to get foward in life
1,Disgraceful,"If you want to believe this rubbish, why not queue up for the Scientology recruiters right away?They have the same way of promising so much, and promoting so well to such a large target market. And if you meet someone who doesn't believe and refuses to believe, well it's their loss.This is one of the most disgusting, pseudo-scientific, psedo-psychological programs/lifestyles currently doing the rounds.The implication that anyone who is struggling is responsible for their situation is reprehensible and shows like Oprah and Larry King are just showing where their so called journalist credentials lie ($$$$$) by even having it on their shows.It is propaganda for the vulnerable and gullible.Instead of encouraging an original idea or even real action, this absurd and well marketed doctrine is little less than a money spinner, collecting cash from those that can least afford it whilst the creators and promoters fill their pockets."
3,Sure it's Good,This Video DVD was suggested by a friend. I have not watched it yet so have no idea if it's something I will enjoy or from which I will gain knowledge. I trust this friend's taste and am sure it will add inspiration to my life.
2,The secret reveled twice over,"You should either read the book or see the DVD, not both. I read the book first then saw the DVD. The DVD is the book spoken out with pictures. I enjoyed the book but the DVD to me was dull and uneventful. I recomend reading the book but I would skip the DVD."
1,Disk Was in 2 Pieces,Disk was completely snaooed in 2... I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MADE IT OUT THE DOOR! And when I decided to send it back I wasn't going to get a full refund so I didn't even waste my time sending it back. I got an email from Amazon saying they couldn't help me.
1,vague,this turned out to be just mumbo-jumbo---and no offense to mumbo-jumbo intended! WIsh I had read reviews before wasting my time!
1,talking heads without experiential inspiration,"the ""Secret"" format lacks passion and imagination...it fails to reach the Intelligence of the Heart"
2,Eh.....read below,"There was once a man who convinced 10,000 people in a village he could show them a guaranteed way to make 100,000 pounds.He charged 10 pounds for attendance.Once the crowd was there... he got up on a stage stood in front of a micraphone and said....""to make 100,000 pounds all you have to do is get 10,000 people to give you 10 lbs each"" and walked off the stage.True story - all though the numbers might be off....This DVD is pretty much the same thing..."
1,Nothing New -,"Your perception of reality is guided by your attitude towards life. Look for good things and you will find them. This is a great message -- but a secret?? No. This information has been around for many, many years.Here's the rub -- wishing for material objects? Too greedy, too selfish.The DVD shows people thinking positively about money and things and getting them -realistic, I think not. Where is the work that you need to do to get these things besides just thinking about them. What about learning from the past so you do not make the same mistakes again.Another issue - Positive thinking to be cancer free? This is frightening. The woman was saying how she did not have any chemo but had positive thoughts about being healthy. Positive thoughts are very helpful but I would not want anyone who has cancer to forgo traditional treatments. Positive thinking and alternative methods can help but please have what the doctors prescribe."
5,The Secret is Life Changing - for those who desire change!,"A friend wanted me to watch this ""movie"" - I suggested after the holidays - another friend wanted me to read ""The Law of Attraction"" - again I said after the holidays. My Doctor handed me a copy of ""The Law of Attraction!""I was beginning to take notice of a PATTERN! I am not slow... but I have goals and there were some I was already working on!I saw the DVD - The Secret - then I read the book - The Law of Attraction! I don't care how you do it... you must take the time to permit your life to change - if you want it to!Very Impactful!"
4,DVD is good - but book/audio is better,"I am a firm believer in The Secret. My girlfriend bought me the audio CD's as a gift and they changed my life. I listened to them in my car during my commute. I ordered a copy of the video/DVD, and was a bit disappointment. There is so much more detail in the book and the audio CD. But if this is the only thing you can get, then get it. Trust and believe in it, its REAL."
2,Don't do it,Just don't do it - unless you can get a used copy for super cheap and you want a good laugh. Not totally without interesting material but it is chock full of cheesy content.
3,"Bad video, Great Message.","This video has a great message, the power of positive thinking. If you have ever had a negative thought, you realize how much that can bring you down. I do think that positive thoughts bring positive actions.However, the presentation of The Secret is more like an infomercial. It has bad lighting, cheesy special effects, and overly tanned, white teethed metaphysical personalities. I agree that it is difficult to believe the hype when you have non-creditable people spouting about get-rich-quick scams.Nonetheless, Think positive and you shall reap in the rewards. Bad video, Great Message."
1,Hoax,"This is the biggest hoax ever. Positive thinking is good, but to claim that through Quantum Physics, man has the power (enery) to affect the world (energy) around him/her is proposterus. It is also incredible that they use Jack Canfield (played by an actor, check the credits) in front of a chicken soup for the soul poster. They never say that this is the author of the Soup series, but the trick is not lost on the observer. Be very careful with these liars. Think positive, but don't give your money to scoundrels."
1,There's a seeker born every minute...,"Oh, the injustice of having to give even one star in this review...""Thoughts become things"" and the ""power of positive thinking"" never fails to sell -- or stand up to critical thought or evaluation. That such a flashy, glib, and facile sham could become a best seller shouldn't be a surprise, but it is a disappointment.Of course, if you get a bunch of self-satified people together, they will tell you their dreams became reality. It's like interviewing only the winners at a casino. Wow, so maybe if they, like, did some creative visualization, all those starving people around the world would have full stomachs?"
2,What?,"I can't believe we bought this, let alone sit through it. If your really that curious, pick one up at your local movie exchange. Then once you've seen it, thow it away. Same old hippie mantra, re-packaged."
2,It's no secret,"I don't believe that people can ""will"" things to happen. God is the ""secret"" and He isn't a secret at all."
2,The Secret,I wish it would be this simple. I find it not believable. I ordered it because my son suggested it. It's going to be his. I guess it's working for him!!
1,how does one vote ZERO?,"NOT EVEN Stupid people should buy this - heck especially not them, they might believe it. This books tells you that you can wish for anything and the universe will give it to you - and the author believes that a person raped is a person that wanted to be raped. The Jewish people killed by Nazi Germany and vicitms of Genocide wanted to be killed.I have wished this book away for 6 months and it still has not gone away. See, the concept is just dense. Dangerous for the weak of mind."
2,"Interesting, but mostly a marketing ploy","The Secret contains some interesting and compelling ideas about the power of positive thinking, but I think overall it's an amazing marketing ploy that's making the producers a LOT of money. Which is brilliant! But since I purchased it and watched it, I sort of forgot about it. I'm generally an optimistic person anyway, so it wasn't an ""a ha"" moment to see them talking about how putting vibes out into the universe makes it come back to you on some level. However, the way they indicate that wishing for something as specific as a bicycle will make it appear in your life is sort of ridiculous. If that were the case, every kid in America would have a pony. :)"
4,Very appropriate,A different movie that brings great tips to our lives by simply saying the obvious ... what we think is what we are. It challenges the human mind and habits by offering a possibility of becoming happier and healthier.
1,Don't drink the Kool-Aid,"I was presented this DVD at work and I found it disturbing. A gimmick to say the least, but the real issue is that I felt like I was being indoctrinated into a cult -- I had to leave about half-way through.I don't have a lot to say about it other than that it's a waste of time, money and thought, but do yourself a favor; sort the reviews for this product by helpfulness rating. It may have 4 1/2 stars average, but you will find that the VAST majority of helpfully rated reviews reveal this product to be what it is -- garbage."
1,New Age Garbage,"Oprah - you let me down with this one girlfriend! The power of positive thinking can only go so far. Oops, I just save you $30.00! If you believe that positive thinking can make you rich, than this is the video for you. If you want to join the rest of us here on earth, than save your money. Maybe these guys are part of a cult...."
5,As a man thinketh....,"Absolutely Fantastic!This DVD shows that most of us are as in control of our lives as if we were all ten-year-olds driving the highways in fast cars, this, because we execute the most powerful forces, our thoughts, without really knowing what command they have over us.Another analogy is, we are like the child with the loaded gun. The power of your thoughts has brought you where you are right now, be it good or bad. If you do not despair at the wasted thought power of the past and rejoice at the discovery of new life, after watching this DVD, your life must be complete already. This is changing the world for the better; I am so inspired by this message because it brings hope, love and the possibility of life fulfillment to everyone."
3,Same old....,"Good movie, but same old secret we all have known. Think positive and you will have positive things. Think negatively and negative things will be. But not worth the money to buy a movie about the ""secret"" our grandparents have always taught us."
1,Waste of Money,This was the same message repeated over and over again. Think positive and you will get money and material goods.
5,No doubt - it is the best early punk collection,"Absolutely no doubt - this is the best video anthology of the early punk rock. What you've got here is 20 songs by the most prominent performers from 1976 to 1978 recorded live in Manchester and London (the Pistols, the Jam, Joy Division, the Clash, Siuxie, the Buzzcocks, Iggy Pop, the Stranglers, the Penetrators and more). All footage is given here without annoying interviews, interrupting snippets and historic perspective baloney. If one wants to own a punk video collection this is the most reasonable start.This was released on VHS in 1992 and to this date sadly there's no DVD version."
4,Needs to come with directions,My grandson loves this gun but the first week was a pain because there were no instructions on how to load the gun. Contacted the manufacturer and they sent a private e-mail explaining how the gun loaded. Was very impressed with the customer service.
2,Disappointed,While this rifle looks really authentic...it was totally disappointing. The rifle came with no instructions on how to load the tiny plastic balls. The durability seemed really cheap considering that it cost $30. I would not recommend this to someone else.
3,Cotton sateen king sheet set,"I was disappointed with these sheets. Brand new they looked great. The size is right on.The color lovely. But, the wrinkle after wash/dry is horrible. I have to hang them on the line or iron (not my thing)or they are a wrinkled mess. And king sheets are hard to handle."
2,Transylvania - today 1966,"Real name of the film ""La sorella di Satana"" and Sorella is played by Joe 'Flash' Riley. That is why we watch the film. Oh yes there are other actors as Barbara Steele; however no one would buy a movie because of that.My star rating is a two. However there is no telling for taste. If you like witchy women with bad completions this can be a good addition to your film library.Innocent newlywed Veronica (Barbara Steele) meets Count von Helsing (John Karlsen). Due to a little mishap her VW goes into the lake and she is displaced by the Witch of the Lake.What should have been a straight forward bad witch movie turns into a slapstick auto chase with such lake-luster dialog as ""is he able to talk"", ""No he is dead"", ""then he is obstructing justice.""If you like the original Keystone Cops you can appreciate this film.They are only missing a good title song like ""Get me to the lake on time."""
3,One for Michael Reeves' admirers,"This film is most likely to be appreciated by admirers of director Michael Reeves, whose first film this was. He went on to make the superior The Sorcerers and then his brilliant, gruelling masterpiece Witchfinder General. His creative growth as a director between these three movies was incredible, and had he not sadly died after completing Witchfinder General, it's generally considered that he would have gone on to be one of the finest directors in Britain.That's the perspective in which you need to see She Beast - the first effort of a budding genius who was learning his craft. It's not a great movie, but essential for completists."
1,Horrid transfer!,"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound. This is in reference to the Alpha DVD release. The Movie gets 3 to 4 stars from me personally."
3,Unwatchable Transfer Looks Like MUD!!,"I wonder why any movie with BARBARA STEELE on DVD (with the exception of SYNAPSE'S stunning CASTLE OF BLOOD) has to look like crap? I mean this one takes the cake...of course it is only $, but I found it unwatchable.And the truly bad pan and scanning treats you over and over to BARBARA STEELE'S amazing talking nose. I guess they did not think in anyway about the framing.Also the sound is hideous, the print is completely faded to the point of almost black and white at parts. And it looks like swamp mud, what can I say. It really is not worth the bucks...wait until someone puts out a decent copy.A lot of ALPHA'S releases are fine but this one is just really horrendous. The print quality is much scarier than the witch in the movie."
5,You'll Be Pleased,"I am very pleased with this dvd of a true classic of the esoteric - you'll be too. The transfer is excellent compared to the older, dark and unwatchable one from Alpha Video. Now, watching the Dark Sky release, I actually can tell what the movie is about! The picture quality is very good, and makes this dvd worth adding to your video library. I have watched it three times already! I love this movie! If you like Fearless Vampire Killers or a Vampire Happening, or the Dracula Saga, you will appreciate She-Beast, especially the print from Dark Sky!"
2,A big disappointment,"Love Barbara Steele, hated this movie. Ill fated attempts at humor. If you are intrigued by the cover, this is a scene that never appears in the movie."
2,Not that great - more of the same,"I'm disappointed with this CD. It's more of the same from Yanni. He's doctored up his old songs and is re-selling them, again. There are a couple of nice tracks. The remake of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons in ""Storm"" is interesting. Overall, I would not recommend this album."
3,Not the same as the DVD,The CD was not in the same order as the DVD songs. Plus the last song during the concert (which was the most exciting one to watch) was not included on the CD. CD misrepresented the concert.
1,Disappointing!,"Skims through the topics, very vague! Not enough detail about the process. Very STRANGE looking presenters. Not recommended."
4,Ancient Mysteries--Destoyed!,"This book presents itself as an encyclopedia of the mysteries of the ancient world. First of all, the authors of this book tale a very rational view towards the subject matter. They present all of the theories for each ancient mystery side-by-side. When you see them this way, you can start to tell which ones are reasonable and which ones are just pure speculation. To be honest, the authors really dig into and destroy a lot of theories, but when you look at the evidence, you have to agree with the authors. If you're a true believer type, this book may not be for you, but those who are just interested in an overview of the unsolved mysteries of the ancient world will find this a very informative and interesting book to read."
5,A great book for newcomers to archeology,"I had bought this book a while ago but not had time to sit down to read it. I am glad I finally did. It is a very well-documented and carefully balanced examination of many issues in archeology. As a non-expert, I found the treatment and the language very user-friendly, unlike other books where authors use terms without defining them. I have learned much from this book and really appreciate the authors' combined expertise and balanced approach. I know some reviewers have found errors or omissions but these are minimal when balanced against the gains to a novice reader. It's a great book to read straight through, or to dip into by chapter or topic. This is due to the excellent internal referencing by the authors to related chapters and themes."
3,Ancient Mysteries slamming the competetion,"This was a very interesting read, untill you realize that the authors have turned this book into a platform to slam Graham Hancock's research in almost every other paragraph. For the theories and subjects to supposedly be approached with an open view, you can bet the money you spent on this book that the authors will take an opposing view to anything Hancock has written. The space that could have been filled with interesting points and observations are instead filled with repetitious slams against Hancock and anyone who may support his theories and oppinions. It would make a great read, if you care to muddle through the finger pointing and biases twards others research."
4,Duncraft triple-tube bird feeder,"Good design for letting the smaller birds eat without interference from larger ones or squirrels. Metal cage is a little soft, but I knew that from having another Duncraft model. Saved $30 compared to buying the same model at a local pet store. Arrived sooner than expected."
1,misleading,"The bag is 50 pounds but the price is for 3 pounds. $120 is the real price. BE careful if you order, it is very misleading."
3,Written for younger girls?,"The title states this is written for the younger girls...and the two main reviews mention Grades 3-6 and 2-5. While I agree that the most of the content and text written is perfect for this age group, the one topic of ""ma$trbation"" is not what I would consider appropriate for a 9 yr old."
2,"""I am disappointed in the talk of inappropriate topics in the book""","I bought the book because it was highly recommended by Amazon customers. Well, little did I know that there is talk of masturbation! Yes, it is 'normal' and yes I will discuss this when the time comes. But an 8 year old does NOT need this information right now. In my opinion, this book should be for older children who have had the sex talk NOT 8 year olds!!!!! Also, the book talks about how the vagina responds to ""sexy feelings"" and produces lubricant. Way TMI for this age!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buyers, be warned."
4,good but...,"it was a good book to help me talk to my daughter, but i couldn't rate it a 5 because I don't like the idea of it teaching young girls how to use tampons. It could just be me but i didn't think that was right. But overall it covered all the bases and a few i'm sure I would have missed."
1,hate it,I'm a Christian and I really hate movies with cursing this one is in the trash. I did receive it on time.
1,Advertised Company through film!!!!!!!!,"When i baught this film and saw the low class of the company advetising their company through out the film,I thaught I was watchig a cheap USA or TNT film.When you buy a dvd there should be no advertising of your company on the bottom of the film.TASTLESS!!!!!By the way the movie itself is just ok the action sequences low budget and the acting barely ok."
4,"Eastern Cherokee by Blood, 1906-1910: Applications 1-3000","The book was received in great condition. Information is exactly what I was searching for, just wrong application numbers. Was needing in the 26,000 and up range, that was my mistake, but the book is still extremely helpful and full of great genealogical information."
4,Big loud and heavy,"Starting with the Yamaha rv2700 receiver and the Yamaha DVD player 2700 - monster speaker wire to these bad boys and you will be amazed. Stereo comes alive. They are really big. Really heavy, geeks dream so buy the wife earrings whilst you throw down 600 or so for a very cool really loud ride. Guy these will rattle the walls. Still come off clear. In case you're wondering the center cs360 with a sub and rears make a very strong powerful home system."
5,Great consistency and aroma,"This is for my pregnant wife's feet. She often has end-of-the-day pains, and I wanted to get her something special. It smells amazing, and comes out in a thick cream, so you don't have to use as much each foot rub. The only drawback is that the smell is a little overwhelmingly mentholated. It's almost like rubbing vick's vapor rub."
4,Great for Foot Massage....Not Foot Reflexology,"For a foot reflexology treatment, I find this product to be too greasy. I need to be able to ""finger walk"" on the client's foot. If I use the smallest amount for this purpose, it works well. On the plus side, that means the product should last longer. It's great for foot massage. It has a wonderful scent and leaves the client with refreshed feet."
3,Hmm,"Download the sample tracks, don't let me decide for you. Oh, and in case you didn't notice, most of these reviews were made by the band. Elvis doesn't even recieve that kind of praise."
3,The recording technique needs work.,"I listened to all the clips, and the songs are all ok, but the actual recordings sound really tinny and fake. I can't tell whether or not they're using amps. My guess would be they're not. Where's the midrange guys? But great music nonetheless. If they can manage to sound like an actual band, I predict success for the Seventh Season."
2,"Goes further than most books, but too many flaws","This is not a good first book on ADO.NET but could be useful for someone wanting to learn some advanced techniques and willing to tolerate far too many typos. On the positive side, the typos are of the obvious kind and easy to spot. Unfortunately, they show that very little attention was placed on proof-reading. Also, I found that new concepts were introduced with little of no explanation."
2,"Repetitive, uneven, and full of poor grammar","This critique isn't so much about Mssrs. Chand and Talbot as it is about Apress. The quality control used in the publication of this book was atrocious. The book was obviously rushed to print (come on guys, you're new to a market with some tough competition, so use your spell checkers and hire professional proof-readers with experience in technical publications!) The writing style is too conversational and colloquial, reading more like an undergraduate end-of-semester project report than a professional reference text. Properly presented, the approximately 850 pages of information could be reduced to about 600.That said, there is a lot of good information here. The authors have tackled some tough subjects (the section on creating custom data providers was especially helpful, but their treatment of the currency manager could have been more in-depth). My advise, however, is to wait for the second edition."
2,"Good content, very poorly written and edited","Disorganized and packed with grammatical errors, spelling errors, and confusing or downright nonsensical sentence fragments, this book is incredibly difficult to read. An example, from page 13: ""Using XML, it's easy to program XML files...""That said, this book does have some interesting content. Were it not for the total distraction of the poor writing and total lack of editing, I would have enjoyed this book quite a bit.I'm extremely disappointed, as I generally find that APress books are of very high quality. Avoid this book; there are much better titles available."
1,Waste of time,"I can't put it in words how disappointed I am with this book; it's a complete waste of time. I've heard the rumors about M. Chands author capabilities, but now I know for sure: he can't write nor does he know anything about the subject he's writing about. I have bought plenty of Apress books in the past and I am more than satisfied with most of them, but this one goes straight in the bin where it belongs."
2,Not that good,"I went through some of the previous reviews and I liked what I saw. but, this book just isn't that good, it has several flaws, inexperienced writing, poor subject knowledge, and a handful of typos. Just not a good book."
5,Magnificent,"I bought this microphones for personal use, parties at home. I never thought It was going to be such a magnificent product. Every one is amazed by the professional sound of this michophones. Three of my friends have ordered this exact model after trying mine.I'm so proud to own them."
5,A reader from Atlanta,"I have just discovered this very charming book The Thanksgiving Ceremony. In these extraordinary times ""new traditions for America's Family Feast"" is a glowing jewel. I am reminded that ""it"" is not about polished silver, starched linens, the right amount of sage in the stuffing, the side dishes, desserts or wine selections, who gets to carve, and whether or not you-know-who will embarrass everyone. ""It"" is about our past and our future, fellowship, commitment, joy, perseverance and progress. And about faithful thanksgiving - every day.Thank you - Ed Bleier - for writing this book. Our family will read it together on Thanksgiving Day."
4,An Excellent Resource For An Overlooked Ceremony,"After years of being vaguely disturbed that Thanksgiving had descended into a football-food orgy at my house, and at the homes of relatives, with little to no recognition being given to the origin of the day, I *love* this book. I am so grateful to the author for taking the time to research and create the rituals contained therein. I intend to implement the readings at my own table this Thanksgiving, and Mr. Bleier, THANK YOU."
5,My Health is alwasy Better in November,"While this work is dated, it is an excellent look at the South Carolina of its day. It is well written, well sprinkled with humor. The chiches often in use in that day are used often and add a certain gentle sweetness when compared to many of those coarse ones in use today. Altogether as pleasant read."
3,different fit,"These pants fit differently than the older Astro. Tighter through the waist and thigh, several inches longer in length, and lost the tapered leg (so fit is much harder to get right when buying online). They did however keep the perforated material so they breath better in key areas. Too bad they changed the design that made them so popular..."
4,Hitting Close to Home,"This book was a great read. I recommend it for anyone with any background. However, the refences to Detroit did make me feel right at home reading it. I loved the leading lady's struggle with her christianity and the ending that teaches us to live each day as if your not promised tomorrow!"
4,HOTTTTT!!!!!!!,"I found the book to be thoughtful, thought provoking as well as entertaining. I've read many books and this one ranks high in my personal Top Ten. To the author, I look forward to reading more of your stuff. Thanks for sharing your talent!"
5,blu-ray pack,"excelente pelicula, muy escalofriante y con bastantes momentos de terror, lo mantiene a uno sentado esperando loq ue sucedera a continuacion."
3,Not the series' best.,"Monkey Wrench, the fourth volume in the Tyler series, is the story of Susannah, a local television personality in Milwaukee who comes home to Tyler at the urging of Joe, who is concerned for her grandmother's health. Susannah's grandmother thinks she's dying and is quite anxious to get Susannah married off and Joe seems like an excellent candidate. It was a very sweet little book, but I was a little irritated with Susannah's willingness to chuck her life in Milwaukee and marry Joe after knowing him only two weeks. Of course, a lot is packed into that bit of time, as it always is in these types of books, but it still seemed rushed. The writing was a little pedestrian, but you can't expect a whole lot from a Harlequin. It was a quick read and I had fun reading it. Still interested in the town of Tyler and the mystery of the Body at the Lake."
1,Single most frustrating product I have ever used,"There is NO way to remove non-adhesive part of the tape without spending the better part of an hour picking and recutting the end. Look for another product--the manufacturer has obviously never tried to use it, or they'd know how difficult it is."
1,not what i wanted,"Says on the back it is only for permanent installation of carpet, and 'may' leave residue. I was looking for something to secure an area rug, but don't want residue. Disappointed in the information provided."
5,Much better than Sofia,"In contrast to Sofia, I could relate to and sympathize with the characters of this story. Also unlike Sofia, Tamar was not shallow and the plot had a clear direction. I will give Ann Chamberlin another chance with ""The Sultan's Daughter"""
2,"Great idea, very poor execution","This book has some great ideas but the characters and the plot are very thin and implausible. I kept waiting for some of the threads to tie together or the motivation for ANY of the characters to be developed but it never happened. This book would have benefitted enormously from some editting and feedback, it reads like something published by a vanity press because no real publishers would bite. The character of Sara is almost developed but the others, especially Mark, seem extremely shallow and to suddenly change personality and action at the author's whim. I was very disappointed at the end of the book."
1,Dont even bother reading,"I grew up in Bergenfield, knew the ""burnouts"" as she called them and was shocked at how Miss Gaines took the facts and twisted them for her own profit, she never spent more than 1 day in town, I never heard of her prior to this book, what about the real story? What about the happenings BEFORE this took place and WHY? Just another worthless adult making money exploiting the children that were unable at the time to speak for themselves.Well done Miss Gaines, hope you sleep well at night........"
1,Shallow look at this subject.,"I was really disappointed with this book. I was hoping the author would spend more time talking about the individual characters, and draw some conclusions and ideas from this -- instead she was just constantly throwing out reasons for teenage angst based on her _personal_ experiences. It seemed like the intention of the book was to show how she would uncover something interesting by immersing herself with the kids... instead she spends most of the book talking about herself instead."
1,Former Bergenfield Burn-Out Hates This Book,"My name is Scott Roberts; and I lived in Bergenfield in 1987; I smoked dope with Cheryl Burress and friends. I was a part of the burn-out ""culture"" of the time.This book, Donna Gaines' analysis, and the majority of press reportage about Bergenfield and the mentality and sociology of the people who lived there are flat-out wrong. Gaines' misguided self-serving book is a proof of observer bias; she went in there expecting to see something and when it wasn't there she altered things to make it work the way she wanted."
1,AS COOL AS A NARC,"Gaines is a condescending, overblown hack who strokes her own ego through a series of punk rock name drops in an effort to inflate every maladjusted teen into James Dean or Sid Vicious. This self-serving book was written exclusively to validate her own hipness - which is outdated at best. (Although she'll tell you otherwise - over and over and over.)"
4,Great book to start with,"Well I knew a little basic things about webpages. Words like rollover button or frames weren't new for me. But I didn't know MX yet. Therefore I have to say it is a good book to learn MX. Although I miss a wider range of tricks and deeper knowledge.But I have to say it's made for [beginners]. Every single hit on your keyboard is documented. For Windows as well as for Mac...Buy it, but I think it wont be the last book about MX you'll buy."
1,"For Database Connected Dynamic site work, AVOID THIS ONE...","Building a dynamic website, I bought this book expecting clear concise information on database connections, drivers, languages and such for my database connected site. Nada - nothing here to help me. I could not find any mention of the Ultradev Dynamic side of the updated MX Dreamweaver application. I particularly needed help setting up OLE Data Base Connection which wasn't mentioned.As an introduction for a beginner the book is a conn. Unlike New Riders ""Inside Dreamweaver MX"" by Gutman Ayers and Booth which is sweet as a nut and ever so easy to understand. Buy it instead. Also look out also for the new Friends Of Ed ""Foundation Dreamweaver MX"" coming out in October. Their Foundation Dreamweaver and Ultradev 4 was brilliant."
4,An excellent starting point,"I purchased this book to assist my staff come to terms with Dreamweaver. I think it's an excellent beginning, and even picked up some helpful infomation for myself too.I would highly recommend this book and would have given it 5 stars if it had a chapter on how to integrate with Fireworks.This book is well written and and has lots of diagrams too.Unlike other books I've had over the years, Dreamweaver MX Training from the Source allows you to engage at the point where you want to engage and do the lesson(s) you need. Other books mistakenly presume you've joined them at Lesson One.Another feature that I like is that in each chapter there are sections of explanation, instruction, notes and tips. This means if for example you are ""brushing up"" on a particular topic, you don't have to read the whole chapter to get a sense of what is being said, the explanation section may be enough."
4,Great Boot,"I specifically bought this boot because it could be resoled. I grew tired of hiking boots that had to be replaced when the sole wore out. Boots should not be made like running shoes. I was leary however, because my previous experience with danner combat boots was less than desirable. This boot isn't the same as those were. This a well made boot and after the very short break in period (30 minutes a day for 2 weeks), these boots are as comfortable as tennis shoes. I look forward to backpacking in these this summer."
2,Informative But Slow And Not Entertaining,"Naturally, one wouldn't expect a book on the history of the bar-code to be particularly entertaining. This doesn't even manage to fulfill my lowest expectations. Still, the content is valuable for an understanding of how standards come about, and also some tidbits on the future applications of barcodes. I read this for a class I took on information technology and policy, and there are a host of far more interesting books on similar subjects that I would recommend before this. I suppose this is supposed to be an exclusively academic read, so perhaps I'm being too harsh. Then again, the content and writing was too simple and accessible to be very esoteric--so maybe I'm not. Whatever. Regardless, don't buy this book unless you're wildly interested in the history of the bar code. If you are, see a shrink too."
2,Disappointed,"Haven't read the book yet, but expected something less flimsy looking. Bought as a gift, and disappointed in the appearance."
2,Not worth the money.,"The toy is small, and the squeak died almost immediately. I bought it because I liked the idea of replacing the squeek. BUT, replacing the squeak was VERY difficult. All in all, I am very disappointed in it and wouldn't recommend it or the other toys like this to others. I bought a couple of these Kong toys with the same result. The dog likes them, but no more than any other squeak toy."
1,Easy to rip apart,Im disappointed in this toy . I bought the smaller duck version of this kong plush toy and my dog loved the duck . This toy is stuffed and I though it was supposed to be plush and not stuffed . My dog tore this apart in one sitting and I'm not happy about it . Why isn't this built the same as the duck!?!? I have found kong toys hit or miss and it's too bad the don't stand up like they claim.Ps I got a small Boston
5,Dog LOVES it,"My shih tzu loves this thing but he did kill one of the squeekers within a week or two, but the replacement squeeker was easy to put in! Wally plays with this thing everyday and gets very aggressive with it and it's still in one piece so that makes me happy!"
4,doggone happy,bought this for my dog and so far he has not destroyed it. I am happy with this purchase. Item arrived as described. Delivery was prompt. Would purchase from this seller again.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"So I got this toy because it is a Kong brand product - strong, tough, or not. My Corgi destroyed and I mean DESTROYED this toy two minute are I gave it to him. I didn't even get to throw away the packaging before there was stuffing strewn about my living room.Very Disappointing."
3,this is an ok toy,The toy is adorable and my dog liked the crinkly stuff inside. She was able to rip it apart within an hour though.
5,Excellent toy!,"This toy inmediately became my puppy's favorite! it's lightweight, has two squeakers (one that can be reaplaced), and is comfy enough for her to use as a pillow. I would recommend this to everyone!"
1,Destroyed in 5 Minutes,My dog (a lab mix) destroyed this in 5 minutes. He did seem to enjoy every minute of ripping out the stuffing though. In general it was a waste of money.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this toy for my 6 month old Austrailian Shepard. She took out the squeaker and all the stuffing in less than an hour. The frog body is still in tact, so the stitching appears strong; however, in the head (where the sqeaker is) the fabric is much to weak."
2,hoping for more,"We hoped these guys would provide more than a few minutes of joy for our dog. He's not a toy destroyer, but within 10 minutes, little froggy had his squeaker pouch removed, and much else besides."
3,really small,"This really is small...I don't know why but I was expecting it to be bigger...I thought I read the size carefully but didn't, that is my human error not the companies.I do love the fact it has velcro on the back so you can change the squeeker if it gets broken."
3,Good for awhile,My dog liked it but it lasted only for a couple of days - just like any other toys he had.
3,Indestructible??????,"It was quite cute -- but I gave Tine (beagle/lab mix, 10 months) the frog at 3:00 and when I returned at 5:00 there was stuffing everywhere (yes, there is stuffing), the squeaker pouch was off in one corner, and the frog was inside-out. Too bad... it was cute."
1,Definitely not a quality KONG product.,My Frenchy Pug shredded this frog in less than a week. Most KONG toys are very durable and they are about the only manufacture that I can rely on for a durable product. This frog failed in every aspect of being durable. KONG COZIE BLUE DOG is a much better choice for a dog that tends to destroy toys.
2,Disappointing experience,"Don't be fooled by the ""KONG"" name on this toy. This toy in no way lives up to the reputation of the tough Kong rubber chew toy. My 15-lb. dog destroyed this frog in about 15 minutes. It comes with an extra squeaker which is nice except with the toy ripped to shreds I really don't need the extra squeaker. I've had much better luck with the Kyjen pet toys."
3,Kong Frog,"My dog has already torn off a leg. Now we call him ""three-frog."" I think this would be a good toy for a small dog, not my 84 lb. Akita."
3,A little different than what we thought it would be,"It's not made as well as the Kong Cozie stuffed animals. Our little 9 pound, Maltese was able to open the back part, where the squeaker is kept. Also, the fabric can be chewed off very easy. Again, I do not think this is a bad toy, just not the right toy for our breed of pups, maybe a pup that does not have one goal, which is tearing apart a toy in a mater of minutes."
4,Decent toy,"Although it only lasted about a week before it was gutted and torn, my dog really enjoyed it. No messy stuffing and he'll still chew on the left overs when he's bored. I cannot say if it lasted longer than his other toys but it was really cheap and kept him entertained."
5,CAUTION! Be sure you're getting the frog pictured!,Ive been buying this toy for my dog for over 3 years and it is excellent quality. Its my dogs favorite toy. It lasts for months and months. Unfortunately It looks like Kong and Dr. Noy have discontinued this particular frog and replaced it with a much cheaper version that is made of completely different materials. I ordered the frog pictured in this review (The discontinued version) thinking that I could grab one of the few old versions that are still out there. Entirely pets actually sent me the new version which is far inferior so be sure you're getting what you paid for. Luckily Entirely Pets gave me a full refund.
2,lasted less than a week,our dog biggie is notorious for destroying any stuffed toys. this one lasted longer than other ones (usually gone in 10 minutes). this was in part due to the fact that we watched him with it and tried to deter him from destroying it so fast. but within a week this lil frog didn't last. we no longer buy stuffed toys for him - only hard rubber - it's just a waste of money to buy these and have the stuffing all over the floor!
4,Good for destructive dogs.,My 1 yr old Welsh Corgi loves to rip stuffed animals to pieces. This frog however she's learned to play nice with. The only thing she got rid of was it's eyes so far. I've had it for a few months and that happened just recently. She usually just shakes it around and launches it into the air so she can chase it pick it up and repeat. The squeaker is also removable (very nice). I'm giving it a 4 because I don't think it would hold up to all dogs and you need to still watch over them while they play with it but there's no denying it's lasted longer than everything else. One thing though is you should wash it fairly often after a short amount of play the hair on the doll gets matted from slobber and when it dries it feels really prickly. I don't really care since the dog doesn't but it's pretty gross lol
5,"KONG Sitting Frog Dog Toy, Small, Green","My dog, Pepi, just loves this toy. It was a 5th birthday gift for him in July. He immediately began carrying it around with him everywhere in his mouth and trying to hide it here and there. He goes and fetches it and sometimes we play throw and fetch with it. The material is so great as he doesn't try to chew the stuffings or destroy the toy as sometimes he does with other stuffed toys. It is just the right size for him also as he is a toy poodle. The toy came in a timely manner and in mint condition."
3,Not super durable but not bad.,My puppy killed this in about 3 weeks. I was not not unhappy but expected it to be a little tougher carrying the Kong name. My puppy is a Cocker-poo so this was actually on the large side for him but it still died a horrible mangled dog toy death.
4,Frog toy for puppies,"I ordered this frog toy in October, 2009 for my jack russell terrier who is 2 years old and very hard on toys. He shares this toy with our 7 month old jack russell terrier and it is holding up great. I am very pleased with this toy and am getting ready to order two more."
5,It sounds silly but my dog really loves this.,This is my dog's little buddy. He carries this silly frog around with him everywhere. It has held up really well. I am thinking of buying a back up one because I dont want him to be heatbroken if this one somehow gets lost.
5,Really great album,"LIsten. This is a great album for a Santana fan. Everyone keeps saying Shaman was weak, and offering their opinions on what could have made it better, but all it boils down to is Santana's guitar playing. He makes the guitar speak, and that is all tha matters. This album has all of Carlos's talent packaged up and presents it very well. Some people don;t only listen to the vocals, they listen to music. THIS IS MUSIC."
3,"Podias hacer mejor, Carlos","I think we all feel pretty much the same about Santana. They are brilliant, and he is a legend. He's one of those few guitar players we will recognize from 2 notes. Well, we also know pretty much the same about MOST Santana albums. The jams are fantastic, and once in a while he gets an absolute CLASSIC in there (e.g., ""Evil Ways,"" ""Oye Como Va,"" ""Black Magic Woman,"" even ""Smooth""), but they are hardly consistent. Well, THAT'S THE CASE HERE, folks. I really like the first track, and tracks 8, 10-12 are good material. You just might want to watch out for the rest of it. The mix of ""Smooth"" here was horrible, and Carlos is lucky he didn't put it out instead of the single that was the big hit. The general quality of the remainder isn't as bad as that, but certainly not his standard quality. You might want to use your MP3 option to get the few songs you are certain you like. At least Carlos chose the right option for this: Put it on a rarities album!"
1,Mine lasted less than a year!!,"This was a perfect sized wine cooler for us and it is nicely assembled. But until it stopped working last week it reset itself every time there was the slightest glitch on the power lines. Not enough to mess up the digital clocks or TV but this thing would let out a beep and set itself to 52 deg.A few weeks ago it started resetting itself quite often without any reason and last week it started going crazy, beeping every few seconds, and finally one continuous beep until it was turned off for the final time.Too bad because it could have been nice to have."
3,"This works for DVD's , but there are better options out there","This CD/DVD wallet is essentially for CD's. The DVD disc can be stored in top section with bottom to hold the insert, but it is not held in place or covered with plastic. Atlantic makes a great product for DVD's and is sold at Target...not sure if Amazon has it...!"
3,Nice but zipper issue is annoying...,"First, I generally prefer Atlantic Disc cases to other brands. They seem to make the best stuff. I have several other models by them, but they all seem to have been discontinued (or at the very least Amazon has stop selling them).This could have been a great case - but the issue with the zipper pull that other reviewers has mentioned is annoying. When the case is open, you have to hunt for the zipper pull so you can shut it. That's lame, and my other similarly sized, but very different design Atlantic case doesn't have this issue.Ultimately I decluttered this case.Still, besides the zipper being hard to find when the case is open, it's pretty nice."
2,different than I thought,"The pendant is really cute, but has a silver skin back to increase the brightness. The swarovski's jewelry what I see in stores do not have this device."
3,Its Okay,I will expect more from his next project because this one was not what I anticipated. It was not the style of worship I was looking for.
4,Urban Praise,"I was pleasantly surprised with how good this CD was. Not what I expected. It was more traditionally than I thought with a contemporary flare. Can't always ""judge a book"" (or CD) by it's cover. The lead singer has an awesome voice!! It was very good."
5,"""OUTSTANDING"" Better then the last Motion Picture I saw for $17!!!","With out question, This is as good as most of the recent Motion-Picture I paid TOP DOLLAR to watch!!! This is what TV should be! what a great job of writing, filming & acting. So, FIVE STARS from this viewer and if you think you might, Just MIGHT want to see this...do yourself a favor and give yourself a treat and rent this series. You will NOT be in RUE of spending the (first) $1.99...If you are regreting spending 2 bucks for this... you have been living under a rock for to long.So, please feel free to refute this review...actually....you can't... it is that GOOD!"
4,the second episode,"I missed this on tv, so I bought it off amazon live. It's a good early episode in this hit show. The only complaint I have is that the show doesn't have any customed villians. Well one that is on the island. But the green arrow is only as good as his villians and he needs more radical villians. And the press would have dubbed this guy the arrow or green arrow, not the vigilante. That's what they do. Minor faults in a great show though. This is a well acted show too. Top notch."
4,This is a great show,I saw the previews for this show and thought it might be a cool show to watch. I downloaded all the available episodes and am totally hooked.
5,awesome,great new tv superheroes show perfect casting for amell and well hopes to see more of this tv series on cw
5,surprisingly good,"Arrow wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be another cheesy take on a DC Comic superhero, but was pleasantly surprised with the mature and sometimes dark story line. Outstanding new show!"
4,So far so good... Hopefully the start of a great run,"So far, ""Arrow"" is well-filmed and well-cast, and the actors are holding their own. Emotionally damaged heroes with deep-seated daddy issues have much more appeal than the suavely swashbuckling ones who have it all figured out, and Stephen Amell strikes an intriguing balance between traumatized playboy and razor-sharp vigilante that just might keep audiences coming back for more. With its strong-willed leading lady and quirky sidekick waiting in the wings, the show is definitely worth investing in the next episode or three (or five!) to see how things develop."
5,great,one of the best takes on the comic book hero lines .Well done on the parts and casting since smallville
2,not unless you're fourteen,"The actors are attractive and wooden. Good series for adolescents who are more into clothes, cars, gadgets, and romance, with a now-and-then bloody fight to break the monotony. As to ""Arrow"" himself: I am reminded of a review of Talullah Bankhead in Cleopatra: ""She displayed the gamut of emotion from A to B."""
2,Entertaining but not going to task your brain.,"Writing is not very good, story line is sketchy, acting i pretty weak. They are all very good looking though."
2,Wooden Acting,"Stephen Amell seems like he'd be a good guy to have a beer with, but he doesn't project much of anything else on the screen. No anger, no outrage, no affection, no enthusiasm, just ""I'm a nice guy"". That's still leagues better than what everyone projects, which is angst and fecklessness. It's hard to care about any of them.A few of the story lines are pretty good, others rather stupid, even if you accept the premise of a comic book world. The screen writers apparently feel a need to end each episode with a syrupy moral lesson, each of which is forgotten by the start of the next show; it wouldn't do to have the characters change and grow.I'd be surprised if the series lasted more than the first season."
5,My New Favorite Show,"I love this show! It's great escaping with this show. Also, Steven Amell would be the perfect Christian Grey for the 50 Shades of Grey movie."
5,Great show!,"Such a great show. I can watch it in HD on my laptop and the quality is great. No skips, no problems. Very good buy. Worth it!!"
5,Review on Arrow,"very entertaining, love the action. Also how they don't have him win every time. Hope it is back for another season"
4,Entertaining,"Based on the DC comic book hero, Green Arrow, the series takes a modern day stab at the green hooded superhero. Other than making me feel grossly inadequate in physical prowess due to Mr Queen's repeated shirtless escapades, I have no complaints. It's a fun time passer."
5,Episodes 1 & 2,"I love the premise of this show! It has action, drama, romance & a great storyline! A keeper for me"
5,Love this show!,"My hubby really enjoys superhero anything, and I usually watch because I have to. But we REALLY love this show!! We are mature, in our late 30s/early 40s, and honestly, almost never watch the CW for obvious reasons. But this show surprised us - it is well-written, has a great cast, interesting plot. I've never seen Stephen Amell before this show, and he is really great! (And cute!) I recommend this show highly!"
4,Good first season,Good first season. Good but it starting to get predictable in the story lines.! ! ! ! ! ! !
5,Great action TV show about the origins of Green Arrow,For the archer or action lover this is a great show that shows how the Green Arrow was born and matures to his crime fighting super hero status.
5,Fantastic Series,"My daughter and I were avid followers of Smallville. When that was discontinued, there was nothing to take its place until this terrific series started. May it go on forever!"
5,Watch more than the first episode,"Based on first episode, I was not sure whether I would like this show or even bother to continue watching. I really liked the way Green Arrow was written in Smallville and the way Justin Hartley played it, so it was a bit of an adjustment to accept this different version. Having watched several now, I plan stick with the series. Story starts off slow, but they are now building the back story and character development very well. Stephen Amell as the lead was a good choice for the tone of the show and direction they seem to be taking the story. Another plus for the show... the actors Paul Blackstone and John Barrowman. Both of these actors have been in other scifi or fantasy genre shows and are doing great with their characters in Arrow."
5,"Taking Names and Kicking *******......well, you know the rest....","This one has to be the best super hero adaptation since Smallville. It follows the mythology of the original somewhat. However I'm fascinated by the obsession this character has. Much like a certain Dark Knight we are familiar with. After being stranded on a desert island, he comes back to civilization. The main character's deceased father left a list of names. His only living son must track down and eliminate them to save his father's company and his legacy. Little did his father know that the people that worked for him were all in organized crime. Not only do I like this show, I plan to buy the DVD when it is out. I can only hope that this one lasts half as long as smallville."
5,Sooo Great!!!,"Easy to get into, wish there were more than 9 episodes in a season. Love the martial arts and not bad to look at."
4,Terrific Program!,"I am so pleased with this program, which could have easily been a re-hash of batman, Superman, Robin Hood and so many others. The unique take on character elements of each is quite entertaining. Great work!"
3,"Started off good, but there almost nothing different from week to week","I enjoyed the first season and thought this might go somewhere. Unfortunately, if you've seen one episode, you've seen them all. This angsty, teen-oriented superhero show is about a guy who methodically takes out every major criminal in his town cause his criminal dad told him to."
2,Sorry Acting by Lead Star,"The lead is so wooden, it's painful to watch. The story originally was interesting but now, borders on silly. Arrow's sister rocks!"
3,"Arrow, The complete first season","Interesting cast and plot, along with some action packed scenes. Why didn't they just call it The Green Arrow ?"
1,Vigilante serial killer,"Very intriguing concept and the actors are pretty decent but the show bogs down after just a few episodes in the sheer number of nameless henchmen the ""hero"" kills while leaving the criminal bosses alive with only a warning, and the constant character inconsistencies that seem inserted only to keep the story from imploding."
1,silly chick-flick,"A guy gets back from 5 years stranded on an island, and he says to his sister, ""you were there the whole time?"" Don't wait until the 7th episode to figure out this is a dumb chick-flick. Crappy acting, cookie-cutter cliches and nonsensical plot."
1,TERRIBLE!,A few good action sequences does not make up for truly lame dialog and one of the world's worst acting!!!
1,lame and cheecky,It was lame and cheecky. The action was miniamle and the story was not interesting enough to follow the series.
1,lousy player,"The movie is great!highly recommend it, BUT DO NOT TRY AND WATCH ON AMAZON. the player is lousy, does not work. customer support is useless, ad does not help. Told I may not meet the system requirements, I do. Told I may have the wrong software installed. ONLY IF YOU TOLD ME THE WRONG ONE! unable to watch on amazon, so I had to watch on a competitor, which worked first try. Wish I could get my money back, at least it was cheap."
5,Good Start,"What a refreshing twist. Daddy was a bad man with a conscience. Mommy is in it up to her ears in evil also. Coincides with the new DALLAS TV show, I guess. Nice to have a superhero with no powers but those he gets from practice and hard work.Good arch story."
4,Solid Series,Good and entertaining! Pretty good character development with several different people to root for and against. You have to suspend your disbelief a good bit but when isn't that true in the super hero genre. Solid.
5,Good show,I think the show has alot of potential. The first episodes caught my attention quickly. Hoping the rest of them are just as good. Like shows made from comic books.
5,"Excellent , entertaining...","A series with the right combination of action, suspense and comic book adventure. A solid hit for fans of this genre."
5,Excellent Product,"Great show, unfortunately missed the first two episodes so downloaded them from Amazon in HD, excellent price works great on my iPad!"
4,!st time to view and now I will watch it on tv,I liked it. It was enjoyable and I will start watching the program. I had not seen it prior to my purchase. Now it has me interested.
4,Great fun,Loved watching this. Packed full of action and a great story line. Stephen Amell is an amazing athlete and sooo hot!
5,Great,The second I was done watching the first season I immediately wanted to watch the complete second season. I just hope they don't get stupid with it like so many others do.
5,Great new show!,Wanted to watch the first episode and it wasn't available on demand or The CW website. It's a great new show!
3,"Great show, slow download","This is a fantastic episode, and we enjoyed it most of the way through, but it took us half an hour to watch the last three minutes because the download became so slow."
4,I only purchased the Pilot Episode!!,"The pilot was very promising. The rest of the episodes are available on Hulu, and are well worth watching. Entertainment in the finest Superhero fashion."
5,Great,"It started out good. The plot drew me in, and each episode makes the series better. Well done. Interesting that the hero doesn't have super powers and he doesn't call himself Green Arrow. I like that he simply paints his face for camouflage to better hide half of it in the dark of the hood, and doesn't wear a lone ranger mask. Very different."
3,Arrow - might as well have given credit to DC and called it Green Arrow,"..Or change the outfit to purple and call it Hawkeye for Marvel comic fans. The show is okay, but not as good as I had hoped and certainly not original concept or storylines at all."
3,"Above average, but sometime predictable",I like this show but it is few and far between with the unexpected plot twists. Some of the plot lines are being stretched out to long and others receive too little attention. Biggles is a great character but receives almost no time on the screen.
1,Not worth the buy,"This product is not worth the buy. I agree w/ the above seller: installiation is a nightmare. Disk changer doesn't work w/ exsisting equiptment. made a purchase of this from ship2you, they eagerly took the $$$ from my account, but where in no big hurry to credit my account 2 1/2 months after i sent the product back. Im still waiting for a refund. The product is big & bulky & doesn't fit if you have limited space to put it in. Not worth all the $$ to ship it back, the headaches, and an installation nightmare, unless your an installation expert..."
1,More trouble than its worth,"I thought this CD changer just plugged into the cigarette lighter. Imaging my surprise when I saw it need to hook it up to power, the ignition and the antenae. I shipped it back but lost a restocking fee and the high cost of shipping. I feel this was misrepresented in the information provided."
5,Med-Surg Nursing Text,"This book was very complete, organized well and came with a CD. I am a retired RN and wanted it to stay abreast of the changes in Nursing. I have had a few friends come to me with nursing questions about their care and I don,t want to give them faulty information about their care or suggest something that may have been found not to be helpful or even harmful. This book met that need. Though it was used, it arrived promptly in excellent condition (including the CD, which had never been opened) as the seller described. I was very pleased and would buy thru Amazon often in the future."
4,Excellent introduction to developing a critical eye,"MacAuley's book should be required reading for any new writers looking to improve their technique and style. It is easy to understand and very informative with a host of examples of good technique in practise. Even better is the section showing examples of poorly written segments by good authors.After reading this book I gave a copy of it to my friend, an aspiring novellist, and it opened his eyes to thinking critically about writing. A must read for those who have not already undergone intensive workshop training, etc."
5,Great book for any writer,"This is a classic!These writers are very thoughtful and comprehensive about aspects of getting into the ""shifts"" of narrative views and such that are often lacking in these kind of books. They also don't insult the reader by making it a ""gosh golly"" dummys type presentation. It's one you will re-read. Another great writer is James Woods - ""How Fiction Works""."
2,Book awesome/constant typos awful!,"All of the Miss Read Thrush Green books I have downloaded for my Kindle contain NUMEROUS typos. Some books every single page, others a handful per chapter. Love Miss Read. Very poor quality due to typos. Have suggested this be corrected prior to this review."
4,Life in a village,When life gets too busy i like to pull up a Miss Read and relax. Varied characters are added in the books but the core characters remain a comforting same. They age and situations change like in our own lives and the village works together to take care of their friends.
4,a guatemalan story!,Our family has enjoyed this book.We spent 8 months living in beautiful Antigua last year and this book brought back memories for us!As a mother of 5 Guatemalan children - I found this book a delightful way to introduce our children to the tradition of Semana Santa ( holy week).We have enjoyed Ms. Carling's book and would recommend it to anyone hoping to introduce young children to the traditions found in Guatemala.
3,Actually wrong item,"The review is very good, i liked that the hat arrived sooner rather than later. It arrived in time for Father's Day. However, it is the wrong hat he wanted the official hat, you wouldn't happen to have that or tell me where on the website i could look so that he could pick it out."
3,Interesting tangent,"I think what must have happened here is that Marion Bradley and Julian May had different ideas when it came to a sequel for Black Trillum.And this IS a sequel to 'Black Trillium, not to the other two books in the series, Blood Trillium and Sky Trillium.In terms of the direction the series takes I much prefer the direction taken in May's sequels rather that this one.This book focuses on Haramis needing a replacement archimage, being old, and near the end of her days. She finds some of what she is looking for in a decsendant of Anigel, however she finds her work to be cut out for her in that Mikhayla has other ideas than becoming an traditional archimage.This is a good book, well written, but the reason why I rated it 3 stars is because the other sequels written by May fit the original story more suitably and are, I think, better.This is a good book to read if you are a fan of Bradley's work."
2,Definitely not up to par with other books by M.Z.B..,"I was very dissapointed with Lady of the Trillium. Though I have not read the other books in the series, I found that it was not nearly as well written as I would have expected from this superb author. It did have an intriguing story-line, but the synopsis was very misleading, for there were no real enemies trying to ruin things. It also didn't have near as much detail and it skipped from one event to another and from one year to another. Most unordinary of all, M.Z.B. didn't take the time to let you really get to now the characters. I found that this book definitely needs some work."
4,"Captivating, though quick, read","Having not read any of the Trillium series, I was a bit skeptical about being able to get something out of this book. However, as a fan of MZB, I took the chance and was not disappointed. Of particular fascination was the relationship between Mikayla and Fiolon, who share a special psychic bond with each other, and the struggle of each of them to assume their respective magical responsibilities. Definitely worth a read!"
3,Be careful!,"Be careful when ordering this CD! The selection of songs indicates that there are 2 CD's, but the product details specify only 1. There evidently are 2 versions of this collection with identical lining and pictures, except that the 1 edition has 29 songs, and the other set has over 50. I thought I was getting the larger collection but wound up only getting 1. Look closely at the the fine print at the bottom of the cover picture before ordering."
1,Morbid,"I thought by the cover that this foreign film was a comedy. It was a sick movie and was disappointed. Unless over the top violence is your thing, I highly suggest staying away from this film."
3,"Good case, but short on extras","This is a super nice looking case that is well padded. However, there aren't any internal dividers to separate cords from the player. And there isn't any strap or anything to keep the player from sliding around on the inside. There is one tiny internal pocket that is perfect for the remote control to the player or earbuds, but cords won't fit there. There is an open-access pocket on the outside of the bag that is big enough for the car adapter, but the AC adapter is too bulky to really fit there. There's plenty of space inside, so I put the AC adapter in there with the player. You have to wrap it well to keep it from clunking into the player, though. I have a 10.2"" player, and this case has more space than I need (It's roughly 2x the size of my player) and fewer pockets than I need. The DVD sleeve holds 8 disks. I'll be able to make this work, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,It's OK,"The case is very well padded, but the inside pocket will hold the earbuds but not the remote for my DVD player. I really like the duel headphone jacks.The player slides around on the inside, its a 10"". The external pockets; one holds the dvds the other will hold the carcharger the 2nd set of earbuds and you can cram the wall charger in it. The problem with this is now its bulky on the bottom so the bag does not set flat. I will be revamping this bag to make it work for me.(Was a xmas present from the children, otherwise would just buy a new bag.)For looks; greatFor use; yuk"
4,Not what we needed,"I was looking for a case that would hold a 10 inch portable DVD with a large body. This would have been perfect except we also needed it to be able to strap to a head rest. Beware that this one does not have that capability. Therefore, I returned it. Otherwise, it is a nice sturdy case from what I could tell"
5,Holds a lot and resists squirrels,"I purchased the Duncraft Safe Haven bird feeder a couple of months ago and I have been very pleased with it. I had earlier purchased a plastic squirrel hood and a long pole from which to hang it from a tree branch. This combination has worked extremely well. The birds love it, with the small ones going inside and the larger birds hanging from the cage and leaning forward to reach the seeds. Now and then a squirrel manages to make the acrobatic set of moves to get themselves onto the cage, but the fully metal construction seems to be sturdy enough to survive the experience, and about the only seeds the squirrel can get are those that the birds had dropped into the bottom tray. Not much of a reward for their work, and they eventually admit defeat and drop off. It is big enough to only need to be filled about once a week, which is much more practical than the smaller feeders which seem to need almost daily attention."
5,Exactly as described.,"Feeder is metal - not wood or plastic. Easy open top to fill with seed. Have only had 1 month, so I have not needed to clean it yet. Seems sturdy. Just what I needed."
1,No better than a cheap feeder.,"We were excited to find this feeder, but the use of it has proven to be a let down. First off, when it rains, all of the food gets wet and spoils. Once that happens, you will get your next surprise. There is no way to really disassemble this feeder to get it completely clean. The best you can do is to remove the cage, top and the bottom plate; everything else is together to stay. This makes cleaning difficult and incomplete.I thought that Duncraft would stand behind this feeder, but they said that since they didn't sell it, they won't exchange it or take it back. So, you are pretty much on your own purchasing it from here as we did. I guess that is true of any retailer that sells their feeders then.I would stay away from this feeder and keep looking."
1,Wrong Bag,"I did my best via Amazon emessage to the seller, to determine what bag I was looking at. Even so, I was sent a bag that was too small, and NOT the Powerflex bag, the seller I assured me I'd get. What I received was a TLK bag --- well constructed, but not what I'd ordered here, based on the seller & the Amazon item photo. The same photo I still see as I am typing this! My best guess is the TLK bag would fit a mini-Applause guitar, certainly not an Ovation medium/large bowl as I was told. If you're looking for a deal on a budget priced bag for any Celebrity model Ovation---this is NOT it."
4,western,very good western movies bought for wife she like anything that has to do with Louis L'Amour well worth the money.
3,"Sacketts, Conagher, Catlow","This Louis L'Amour Collection was a Christmas gift for my husband. We watched the movies and were pleased with The Sacketts and Conagher. We did not care for Catlow. For such good movies as The Sacketts and Conagher,the collection deserves a better third movie. Usually Yul Brenner movies are pretty good, but we were disappointed with Catlow."
3,fun when you're in the mood,I'll play these again someday - sometimes a simple story of good guys and bad guys with charismatic actors hits the spot
3,Simple western fare.,"Loved the Sacketts book series many years ago. Louis L'Amour wrote prolific good, action packed, simple ""good v bad"" westerns; actually the same western with different titles most of the time.I really liked the ""Crossfire Trail"" dvd and tried these on a whim. ""The Sacketts"" is good, ""Conagher"" is a quiet, gentle, character driven tale, and ""Catlow"", which had the most potential as the funniest, action packed novel of the three, is poor. It should have been much lighter and comedic, but is just bland, wooden, and episodic. Still a really cheap price, one good film (Sacketts) one gentle but forgettable film (Conagher) and one poor film (Catlow), made more disappointing if you enjoyed the book. Basically simple westerns and a fair deal."
1,Disappointed,I preordered this dvd assuming that it will have something new or different than older version. it's the same thing with new dvd cover. Pls do not waste money for old stuff in new packaging.
4,"Meanwhile, back in the States...","This volume of The Spirit Archives features Spirit pages from January to June, 1943. Will Eisner was in the Army at the time, so he didn't work on these comics. They were drawn by Lou Fine, and scripted by writers like Manly Wade Wellman and Bill Woolfolk. It's not as good as the comics by Eisner, but it's still a solid crime fighter comic book."
5,Unentitled Review.,Bill Drummond is a funny man. He is a gripping and vivid writer. If you have low boredom tolerance you will be satisfied.Hope Bill Drummond writes more.
3,"Important Content, Grotesquely Expensive","Buy this book used and in the original 1960's format for under $10.It cost the publisher no more than $7.50 per copy to publish this book, it should be sold on Amazon for not more than $30.00 (Amazon keeps 55% of the retail price)."
2,slightly adolescent,"When I first read this book, I was on my honeymoon and thought that it was hysterical. Then, since I loved it so much and so did my husband, I read it again and couldn't honestly figure out why I liked it. It seemed incredibly adolescent and just dumb. Some of it was still silly and satisfying, but it just wasn't as funny as I had first thought. Blame it on the newlywed hormones, I guess."
5,OMG,"I have to say that I laughed while reading this book, it truly is funny. Did it reaffirm my faith? Not really, but it's kind of cool to think that the Son of God had a sense of humor and a devilish sidekick."
3,"Some great one-liners, but not a book","This is a weak book by a good author. It tells the story of Jesus' middle years in a half-comic, half we-are-all-one sort of way. The premise is interesting, but the book reads like a collection of one-liners produced by a group of writers for stand-up comedy.This was a book club pick and I found it hard to get past the first 50 pages."
5,Laugh out Loud Fun,"This is one of the funnies books I've ever read. It is laugh-out loud kind of a book, that will get you looks on a NYC Subway. I always wondered what did Jesus do as a kid and Christopher Moore's imagination tells a great story. Since I've bought the book I've been lending it to all my friends and co-workers. If you want a fast and funny read on a gloomy day, this is the book for you."
3,Biff and Christ's Excellent Adventure,"A pleasant stroll through the life and times of Jesus the Christ. Seems like an entirely more probable story than the one contained in that other book (the bible). Christopher Moore offers us a much more entertaining story than the one written so long ago . . . and, this one, unlike the first is totally believable as all the errors of the first are corrected."
2,"5 Stars for Vonnegut, Adams, C.S. Lewis, ""Nice Try"" to Moore","An excellent premise for historical fiction, yet Moore seems to have missed the essence of Christ's character.Where did Moore go wrong? He stayed true to the Gospels and dismissed the rest of the New Testament books, on the premise that ""Josh"" could not have known them. ""Josh"" though was is and always shall be, according to Gospel John.Kudos to Moore, however, on integrating what is now known as Eastern religion into Josh's understandings.As for a recommended read, try ""The ScrewTape Letters"" by C.S. Lewis for something witty yet more resonant with reality."
1,"Less Moore, Please","Make no mistake, I thoroughly loved Chris Moore's previous novels and own them all. Have read the others a few times and they don't pale with re-reading. BUT Lamb is simply too lame.It reads as if it were written by a manic sophmore trying desperately to make bad jokes and succeeding. Moore can be terribly witty and absurdist, but in Lamb he's dragging his [posterior] for jokes. Sorry, Chris, but this is drek.What's happened to your sharp sense of humor? Why is this written as if you were lazing in a hammock and giggling over your own ""cleverness""? Huh? Whatever you do, DON'T WRITE A SEQUEL!By the way, it has nothing to do with the content or irreligious tone of the book, I'm fine with that, but the style just simply sucks wind."
1,Frat-Boy Humor is right!,"If you have the entire Beavis and Butthead series on DVD, this is the book for you. If you were first in line to see Dude, Where's My Car?, you'll probably enjoy LAMB.I, however, am not a 15 year-old and found little to be amused by in this story. I picked it up because I believe nothing deserves a good spoofing as much as the bible but was disappointed to find the author obviously straddling a fence: wanting to poke fun at Christianity without angering a single soul, a difficult feat even when attempted by a more skilled writer. Maybe if he had just gone for the jugular without worrying whose toes he might step on, he wouldn't have had to resort to juvenile Tom Green type humor."
1,Lamb is Lame,What constitutes effective delivery of discernable humor in this book to some and not others...like me...is puzzling. I thought the attempts of humor fell flat. It was like watching a really bad sketch on SNL...only the sketch just went on and on and the viewer is locked into a straight jacket of anxious pity for all involved. I teach Middle Schoolers and I think even they would deem the humor in LAMB is lame.
1,Don't waste your time,"I read this book on a recommendation from my friend. She said she has never laughed so hard while reading a book. I went into it expecting something great, something at least a little bit amusing. I was so excited when the book showed up in the mail, and couldn't wait to start reading it. I think that the premise has great potential, however this book is a major let down. It's really not funny nor amusing and so incredibly poorly written, you can't even rely on the writing to carry you through. Honestly I think that my 12 year old brother, could write a more interesting book on this subject. After the first couple chapters the book became a chore to read and eventually I just put it down all together (let me assure you this is a rarity, I typically breeze through books in 2 weekends)."
4,a new way to think,"I feel like this book gave me a new insight to the teenage years of Christ, what could have happened, what might of happened. If you read this with your mind open you will enjoy it."
3,The Plot,"The introduction to the plot was quite interesting but then the situation went on so boring and the ending was quite traditional. I didn't feel the crisis and the climax of the plot and probably that's why the resolution was very traditional.The setting of the Novel was pretty good though, and the characters were well presented. With no doubt, the auther is very creative and innovative.The book contained couple of wisdoms that the reader can benifit a lot from if applied in real life.The Novel is so comic and I did enjoyed the humourous tone in it."
3,simply funny,"Christopher Moore's wit is more than enough to make up for anything he lacks stylistically. My only complaint was the somewhat unsatisfying end-but then, I'm not sure how I would have ended it differently. Although in closing the author gently pokes his own work as though hopefully attempting to extract more depth than just Funny, Lamb ends up an utterly simple tale without much to say in any greater context, despite the fact that Jesus is the novel's protagonist-but it certainly is Funny."
4,"Imaginative, intelligent, tries too hard","- Liked the imaginative way of looking at the human side of Jesus.- Felt very forced after midway as if the author had 5,000 penis jokes and felt pressured to squeeze in every one. I get it, OK? Sometimes overusing a gag kills it.- A very intelligent writer, might introduce different religions to the beer pong crowd who might not ever have the urge to investigate something deeper.- Very funny in parts- I was a bit disturbed about Biff's treatment of Mary. Mother of God aside,as a female, any friend who has a crush on your mom and brings it up all the time and hits on her would be considered very gross in real life, not endearing at all.- The book could have been cut in half, would have kept the originality and humor without getting forced and tired."
5,Incredible,"Christopher Moore has accomplished the impossible: Written the Jesus story as a comedy, without insulting him or in any way denegrating his mission.It was not until I finished reading it that I realized what a great book it is. No one knows what happened to Jesus before he was 30, but Moore makes up a funny story that almost could fit into what we know of Jesus after that age. He actually plays the part about Jesus' ministry fairly straight--he doesn't deviate far from the Gospel accounts; no mention of Jesus and Mary Magdalene being married (although they do love each other, without ever sealing the deal), nothing about escaping the cross as some have suggested, and Jesus really does heal people. Jesus maintains his humor throughout the story, all in the modern American idiom.One of the most humorous books I have ever read, and inspiring in many ways."
5,Biff is THE MAN,"I laughed out loud until it hurt - and it felt great. I would never have left xtianity if the followers I encountered were full of the good humor Biff displays. For all of the laughs, there are also insights to be gainned here as to how to answer the obnoxiouly overused question of WWJD?"
4,Jesus Had a Best Friend,Hilarious look at the fictional best friend of Jesus in the missing first 30 years of Jesus's life. Light and full of fun!
5,Lamb The Gospel According to Biff,"I've read this book before. This is Christopher Moore at his best. He is obviously well read on various subjects which are obscure or even unheard of by many. Rather than showcasing this fact he actually covers it with humorous and witty dialogue. This book is so fun and entertaining that it really is hard to put down. If you are offended by tongue-cheek or 'in your face' religious humor, this will not be for you. As for the rest of you, enjoy this remarkably good read."
5,Moore at his best,"I have to begin by saying I am a huge Christopher Moore fan. He's not for everyone so I'm careful who I give him to. With that said, I absolutely loved this book. It was funny, thoughtful, and with all the usual Moorian character fabrication, he developed a believable teenage Jesus and his wayward, delinquent friend Biff who tells the gospel. In my mind, Moore has two types of books, those that are totally weird and get more & more far fetched as the plot develops (like Lust Lizards of Melancholy Cove) and then this type, which is more thoughtful as well as funny (I put his book Its a Dirty Job in this category)."
5,Hysterical,"One of the best books I've ever read. I actually laughed out loud several times. If you're familiar with the Bible, you'll get most of the references. Be advised, that there are parts that may come across as sacrilegious. So if you're a die-hard Jew or Christian and you are easily offended by comments about either your religion or your religious beliefs, you might want to give this a pass. But if you can remember that this is a story intended for humor, this is a great read."
5,Can't Go Wrong,"Christopher Moore has cornered the market on light religious satire with his ""Lamb"" and after having given this gift twice and losing a losing a third, loaned copy, it feels safe to say that if you're looking for a gift for someone with a sense of humor, shop no further. The book stands well on its own but the faux-bible cover and gilt page edges could easily make this one of the most prized elements of any home library. You WILL NOT be disappointed."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!,"Overall, I enjoyed much about this book. It was at least 100 pages too long. The author took the low road, by using profanities and profane incidents which interestingly enough he tries to absolve himself somewhat with an afterword. I am a Christian with a great sense of humor and even an ability to laugh at ""blasphemy"" if I know it is in fun, but with the amount of obvious knowledge of the Scripture by Mr. Moore, it is too bad he didn't stick to his obvious story telling talents without selling out to some of his lowbrow antics in the book. I might read some of his earlier works, but I would have a hard time finding people to recommend this book to wholeheartedly."
4,Irreverently Funny,"Christopher Moore delivers an irrevernt, often laugh out loud account of Jesus (Joshua)and his best friend Biff when they were kids. Many humorous situations interspersed with biblical and historical references make this book well worth a read."
4,"""I'm good with weather.""","I'll start this off by saying that you will not like this book if you're not looking forward to laughing. As a matter of fact, if you can't take a good joke, you'll probably hate this book.That being said, I love this book. This is coming from a college student who is already a couple grand in debt. I'd say a smile is overdue. And it has been delivered.As a believer, I know how this book can be taken offensively. I mean, come on. Jesus learning Jew-Do (Judo)? Clearly, that's heresy and suchstuff.Okay, maybe it could've done without the obscenities. But all the same, it's a fun read if you can see it as what it is: FICTION."
4,Funny book with a message,"This is the most surprising book I've read in a long time . . . maybe ever. I expected the normal LOL humor of C. Moore, and I got that. If you think laughing at irreverent humor will send you to hell, you better pass this one by. For instance, when Joshua (Jesus) refers to his disciples as the ""dumbest sons of bitches that ever lived"".On the other hand, you will come out of the end of this book a LOT more knowledgeable of the historical aspects of the Bible and how some of the stories have been misused over the years. You will have a better understanding of the shared roots of Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. AND you will hear the story of Jesus told in a way that will touch your head and your heart. I wish I had read this book years ago. Very enlightened and VERY hilarious. How Christopher Moore pulls both off is truly amazing."
4,Wonderful,Brilliant. Moore manages to pull this off in a way that is not offensive to anyone. Very good read for an airline trip.
3,"Interesting Idea , Poorly Executed","The basic concept of Lamb is almost genius. Moore's somewhat irreverant take on the story of Jesus adds a human-ness to the characters that has probably never been imagined by most people. Moore is generally successful at keeping the story close to the historical version, so that the story remains believable and doesn't become too ridiculous.However...Instead of using real humor for his book, Moore seems to be totally preoccupied with sexual-perversion-type jokes. Having just finished the book, I'd estimate that about 80% of the attempts at humor are of the lame ""Porky's"" variety. After all the research that Moore did for the book, that was the best he could do?If you simply cut out all of the unnecessary and pathetic sex jokes, the remaining book would probably be pithy and witty. Maybe someday Moore will come out with an edited version."
4,Most Likely My Favorite Book These Days,"Christopher Moore writes one of the most hilarious books I've ever read, mostly because he takes his normally outrageous ideas and puts them into an arena that everyone knows. Last year I saw it as a staff favorite at Barnes & Noble while on family vacation (I'm sixteen), and I must say that this novel is entirely different from all of Moore's other books. Reading other Moore books has sort of changed my mindset on this book and made me look more favorably upon it. Biff is the ultimate underdog who, despite being a smart ass, is entirely devoted to his best friend and the girl of his dreams, so much so that the inevitable part of the ending is poignately sad. Lamb is a completely hilarious novel that makes me actually laugh everytime I'm in church."
5,"Jesus Loved Bacon, Pass It On",Christopher Moore's research and extrapolation of the Bible and all of the other cultures explored in the book is obvious. Bif is a delightful narrator and the read is very entertaining.
2,not for me,"I started it but didn't care for it so didn't finish it. My daughter likes it and says when you grt into it, it is funny."
1,A weak high school writing assignment,"Poorly written. Attempts at humor are sophomoric and, worse yet, not funny. I tried and tried but just couldn't finish it."
3,Sketchy and Lightweight,"It's my own fault that I was looking for serious scholarship and not just off-the-cuff invention that wasn't even very funny. The author obviously doesn't know his subject. I much preferred THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JESUS CHRIST ""as told to"" Neil Elliott,which found humor in reality and daily living, which was a meatier read and gave you a feeling of fullness when you pushed yourself away from the table. Moore's book is for people who want an intellectual meal out of cream puffs. But that's just me."
2,Glimmers of wit but gets old quickly,"That pretty much says it all. It's like a fusion of ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" meets ""The DaVinci Code"" meets ""The Simpsons."" The best parts were with the angels. I especially liked the angel who discovered T.V. and wanted God to send him back to Earth as Spiderman. The book is researched and pleasantly irreverent, however, so not a complete bust."
5,book,My daughter wanted this book and I was so pleased to find it. She was really pleased with the book. It arrived as promised. I enjoy shopping with you.
4,Lighthearted Satire with some Depth to it...,"I flew through this book pretty quickly, as its lighthearted and colloquial style of relaying ancient events kept the pages turning.The book's layout was inviting, and so was the content. A high degree of familiarity with the Bible and its passages is not required to enjoy the book and its references.Moore deserves a good deal of credit for his clever approach to filling in the more sparsely recorded years of the New Testament, in a way that is fun and edgy while not being disrespectful to anyone's beliefs.Thumbs up."
4,Funny read,"This story is about guys relationships with other guys, humility, courage, loyalty, libido, and the stupid things guys do. The setting (the story of Jesus's best friend) contributes to the humor and makes the book feel irreverent, but taking the book seriously (regardless of your religious views) would be part of joke."
4,Typical Moore,"Very entertaining with just the right amount of depth, humor and blasphemy.Eight more words? Really? Make the Amazon review process less of a pain."
4,Worth reading,"I'm almost sad that this book is fiction. I always liked imagining that Jesus had a best friend by His side throughout the majority of His life. I could go on in a lot of detail, but I fear the response of fanatics from both sides of the spectrum, so I will just say this: Read this book if you, like me, imagined that there was at lease one human being who didn't want anything from Jesus; he or she just wanted to be His friend."
4,"Funny, unique approach that pays no disservice to its subject","It's hard to get offended reading 'Lamb' as Moore treats the titular character with respect while portraying his human side, and of course letting Biff do all the dirty work. Those of faith will easily dive into the book, relishing in a story about a man who, while divine, is still a human with all the same anxieties, fears, and desires. The book takes a somewhat odd turn in the middle that I felt pushed it a little too much into fantasy, but in retrospect it did add a lot to the story and broke the book up into three acts. The end was particularly moving, and the change in tone and tempo appropriately brought a new perspective to one of the most-told tales.In terms of writing style, the book is conversational and it is easy to shoot through. You can pick it up for five minutes and make progress or two hours and not grow weary."
5,Probably as close to reality as any of the gospels,"After 2 millenia of copying, translating, changing to fit the politics of the day, and fitting to our current mores, it's pretty unlikely that the 4 biblical gospels as we know them hew to their original content very directly. Add to this the fact that even the original versions were likely written for specific communities in specific states of belief, unbelief, and often turmoil, and the probability that we can extract a real image of Jesus the actual person and charismatic leader is unlikely.This book, in my opinion, is Christopher Moore's masterpiece to date. Certainly tongue in cheek, but it actually winds up respecting the message we are all searching for in the good news as much as most contemporary writers, and even adds to the trove of insight.A one line summary, ""relax, being God incarnate doesn't have to be a totally tight butt, stressed out experience.""A great read."
5,"Eloi, Eloi&#65533;what a great book!","I'm in between classes at Miami University and I just put down ""LAMB"" - my first Chris Moore read. If this is ""frat-boy"" humor, I better pair up at the party house for some studies with this guy. I can't believe the guy at Publisher's Weekly even read the book. The next buck I get from home will go into the coffer for another Chris Moore classic!"
3,Lamb. The Gospel According to Biff,"I is a different approach to traditional tales of Christs time. I don't find it particularly compeling, as in I can't put it down. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a more contemporary and down to earth version of the bibile."
5,Wonderfully Wacky,"Wonderfully wacky humour that made me laugh....made me cry. Had me reaching for the quote feature on the kindle to highlight quotes to think about later. Helped me with a problem I was pondering over. Wish Biff was around to make us all laugh more - we could all use a sidekick like him. Personally, I find that books that help you look at your own faith and others from another view point only make my own faith stronger. This is after all a novel. I found the author's depiction of Joshua delightful. I wish that I had not finished the book because I enjoyed it so much - wish I could give it 100 stars. Will have to just go off and play with my own otters on my own Pacific Island instead. Congratulations on a fantastic book young man.....anyone under 100 qualifies as young....over 100 you have to think about it."
4,The Fellowship of the Gospel,"Biff plays Samwise to Joshua's Frodo, only much more hilarious. A thoroughly wonderful and imaginative story on Christ's missing years."
4,What would jesus do? for the first 30 years of his life.,"This book is a fun (and profane) look at Jesus' young life. The gospel according to Biff. I liked it. It entertained me and lent some human life to an old tale. Is it the great story ever told? Not really, but for my money it never was. I think Jews and Christians alike could be offended by this...actually Buddhists and Confucianism folks might have some issues as well. Isn't that what religion is all about - instilling your issues in your young. So, take a journey on the religion roller coaster and entertain an alternative perspective. It's OK. Byt he way I am getting to like this guy -- moore that is."
4,You Haven't a Prayer In Keeping A Straight Face,"Mr. Moore states it very well in his afterword, ""If one's faith can be shaken by stories in a humorous novel, one may have a bit more praying to do."" I believe there are two reasons the book is so popular and funny. #1: The book creates farce in an area (religion) that makes many people uncomfortable. There's the I-can't-believe-the-author-wrote-that reaction to some of Mr. Moore's material. Because he's writing about Jesus and the clan, some readers will bust out laughing and others will be deeply offended. Even if you are not religiously inclined, there's plenty of absurd, off-color material between its covers to tick off more sensitive souls. And reason #2: the guy has a very quirky, creative sense of humor. It's rare for a book to cause me to burst out laughing so often. Take it for what it is, a funny work of fiction. And to anyone who believes this lighthearted novel should be shunned, it's your loss."
2,Not his best,"I'm a Moore fan and had high hopes for this book, but my hopes were not realized. Moore pussyfooted around the story of Jesus, but was so careful and reserved with his humor that the end-result reads like a weak ""Life of Brian"" with the funny parts removed. Add to this an afterword apology for the potential affront he may have offered some readers and you have quite a letdown of a book from an accomplished comedic author. Moore can do better and has proven it in the past (when he does not need to be concerned about insulting established institutions). So, give this one a pass or borrow it from a friend and wait for him to get back into the groove."
5,"oh, but Josh dies!!!!","I loved this book!! It's a laugh out loud type of book that makes you want to cry and laugh at the same time. The only sad part was the ending...Biff's best friend had to DIE and the story ends! What a bummer! We all know he dies, but Moore's story keeps it fresh and the reader can't help but love the relationship btwn the two best buddies.Why did he have to die and end this book?!"
3,"Good Book ""Spoilt"" by Bad Word..","""Lamb""This is a very good and entertaining book,,, Totally Ruined by theuse of the ""F"" word...I am in no way a prude and have often been known to use the f wordon many occassions, but it's use in this book really spoilt thewhole thing for me, just as it has for the two friends that Ipurchased the extra copies of this book for..."
1,Meek.,"Exactly the kind of novel you'd expect from an author who thinks Biff is a funny enough name to carry you through the first 50 pages. After that, you're pretty much on your own, wishing the building would collapse, a flood would wipe out your library, or, by chance, you'd bought a funnier book."
1,Starts out good...,"I purchased this book blindly because it sounded interesting. As I read I really like the book, and I thought it was going to be an awesome book. And it was at the beginning then things changed. I don't want to ruin the story but as soon as the boys started learning lame Chinese stuff and then the Demon, ewwwth. I put it down. I am not into the Chinese stuff at all, and I completely loath scifi stuff. I think a lot of people will like the book, but it just got stupid to me."
1,Crap,"This book is crap. I've never read a book I haven't finished until this one. The only reason I got as far into the book as I did, which was about 3/4 of the way, is because I'm in a book club and felt I should finish it but just couldn't. If you believe in Jesus Christ at all, don't waste your time, it's offensive."
1,hated it,"If I wanted to be assaulted with F words, I'd pick up the latest bestseller. This book was disgusting. Now, I don't think there's a Christian alive who hasn't wondered what it must have been like to be with Jesus during his 30 unchronicled years; I certainly have pondered that question myself. I was hoping for an imaginative and humorous exploration of the possiblities that might have presented themselves, but what I got was tired drivel loaded with humor on the level of a 5 year old. This book was horrific. Normally, I'd pass this on for someone with different tastes who might enjoy it, but this one went straight into the trash can along with old coffee grounds. I hope the coffee grounds weren't offended."
1,"Odd, Boring and too long audio",I was so bored after the first of 6 audios that lasted over an hour that I stopped listening.
1,Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff,"I assumed that since this book was supposed to be a ""Gospel"", that it at least would not have any foul language. Obviously, I was wrong. Because of the foul language, I didn't even see much humor. I read four chapters, but couldn't waste my time reading any more. I would obviousely never buy another of Christopher Moore's books.I""m sorry I wasted my money and my time. I would have given it zero stars, but you didn't have that choice."
5,Great Author,Chris Moore is a true genius. This was the first of his books I'd read and was immediately hooked. Wonderful works of satire; reminicsent of the late Mr. Vonnegut.
4,A Messiah and miracle worker with a sense of humor,"Moore created a tough challenge for himself as a comic writer by putting a fictional spin on the life of Christ, especially the years between His childhood and ministry that are a wide gap in the Gospels. Yet he succeeds brilliantly in giving the iconic Messiah and miracle worker a human personality with a trait some of His most dour, so-called followers centuries later still lack - a sense of humor. The number of grammatical errors and occasional factual goof (in his epilogue Moore refers to the Book of Revelations, instead of Revelation) are disappointing. Yet, overall, his research is meticulous. For me, the narrative stalled in the middle - where Moore has the Messiah in the Middle East learning Eastern philosophy from the three wise men. Still, ""Lamb"" is memorable and thoroughly enjoyable."
5,Absolutely bloody fantastic.,"This is the best book I've read in a long time, and I read alot of books. It's hilarious, well-written, and the characters are very well developed. It's appealing whether or not you're very familiar with the Bible, and although some of the parts are mostly entirely fictional (i.e. when Jesus goes wandering off to the far reaches of the world), they provide a very rational, albeit hilarious, explanation for what he does in his lost years.Moore researched this book very thoroughly, and it shows. It's an interesting and absorbing read from beginning to end, and I guarantee it will make you laugh out loud at least once, granted you have a sense of humor about religion. I'll tell you what I tell all my friends: READ THIS BOOK!"
