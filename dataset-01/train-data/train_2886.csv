1,Trouble with wireless signal,I got this router for the usb part and never thought I would have trouble with the wireless signal. I have my notebook in the same room and could not get a full signal out of the router. I went back to my Netgear router and the signal was excellent. Not with the Linksys. It was just good. Went to another room and the signal was very low.I took the router back.
2,problem with sharing files over internet,"As of this writing, the feature as advertised in the box is simply not available. Perhaps one would be able to share files over the internet in the next firmware upgrade."
1,Storage is Useless & so is Support,"This router seems to route the signal just fine but the storage feature is weak. Whatever I copy to the external storage device has date of 1970 because the router cannot get a ""current time"" through the router setup page. I have called and emailed Linksys about the problem several times over the past 3 days. They acknowledge the problem and tell me that they are sending a firmware update that is not on their website but for some reason can't seem to send it. I get a bunch of fumbly reasons as to why they can't send it - ""our Manila office is working on it, my supervisor is on break""Wait til they work out the bugs on this."
4,Works well (with some additional work),"I use this router with four computers, two air port expresses and a USB drive. By upgrading to the latest firmware and re-formatting the drive to NTFS I was able to get the USB harddrive working correctly. The documentation does leave something to be desired, but with some searching the Linksys knowledge base I was able to get things worked out."
3,I've seen better birthday books,"Since this book did not have any reviews, I was hesitant to buy it. Instead, I got the book from the library. I'm glad I did not buy this book. Many of the party ideas are so-so (a bit boring, if you ask me). The cakes are neat, but seem like they would be very labor intensive & probably would not end up looking as nice, as many of the recipes use fondant icing. I've never used fondant, so I'm sure any cakes I made using these recipes would be a recipe for disaster! I'm going to stick with some of the other books that have gotten higher reviews, including the Family Fun book, which has a ton of fun ideas."
5,All Time Best Kid's Book Ever,"I have three grown daughters. Each rates this as their favorite book when growing up. It was such an important one for them, that when I found some Blue Faience Hippos at a museum shop, I bought one for each of us as a keepsake.The illustrations are gorgeous, the story makes us cry every time. Still. Yes, we still read it. This book is a gem."
4,Fantastic,"It is a bueatifull story, great art and I love hippos anyway. I have one of the hippos shown. WOW"
1,Great Looking Watch But A Dud & Poor After Sales Service,"I bought this watch and it arrived with what was initially thought was a dead battery. I was promised for months by Watchisland that replacement batteries were sent which never arrived. I eventually bought a new battery myself and the watch still doesn't function. After that they promised me a new watch which still hasn't arrived after 5 months. Now they have stopped replying to my emails. In promising me a new watch, they told me this model was no longer available but i still see it advertised in their catalogue. Be careful buying from this company."
3,Decent for price,"Good for what it is and the price, but tis was purchased just as a backup emergency. Very hard to get any leverage,"
3,Great camera but for the zoom noise,"I got this camera several years ago and LOVE it - except for one problem. When taking video footage, there is a grinding or clicking noise that happens when you zoom in or out. This is quite audible during the playback of the videos. At most times, the grinding literally sounded like a buffalo grunting (we were in yellowstone at the time) one of my friends said. It is very obnoxious when you are trying to take video of things like weddings, your child sleeping or pretty much anything that you want to be able to hear what is going on. Also, who wants a grinding/grunting noise during video shots?Kodak says that there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the camera - when I sent it in for a $120 fee - and returned it to me.Since I take a lot of video, I gave this camera a 3 stars due to this problem."
1,buyer beware,"I bought this camera a little over a year ago, it was great at first and got some really nice pictures. After a bout 6 months it started to act up, Since then I have had to send it in to kodak three times. The camera will no longer focus and I am upgrading to a real SLR...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHEAP CAMERA... I lost some really important moments to blurry pictures because of this camera."
2,A little disappointed,"Is is just me or has anyone else experienced a grinding noise coming from this camera?? Right out of the box, it sounds like a little motor wants to shut down. Is this normal?? I didn't expect the camera to make any noise aside from zooming in and out. Please let me know if anyone else has experienced the same thing."
2,I think I just wasn't lucky enough,"I bought this camera on April 2007, and I have to say that I was really excited with its performance. I took great pictures, considering my amateur level. Unfortunately, by November 2007 it got broken.Without any notice, from one day to another, it showed a 'tick'. The image in the viewfinder or LCD goes up and down continuously, making a still pic or exposition almost impossible.I wont give one star to this camera because during the time I used it (about 6 months) I thought it was great for its price. For the time being, I will fire my last shot to Kodak US, since the local repair center couldn't fix the problem... =( (I got the camera via Amazon, I live outside US).Wasn't I just lucky enough?='("
4,GREAT CAMERA,"HAVE HAD THE CAMERA FOR A MONTH,EVERY THING WORKS GREAT WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANY ONE LOKING FOR A DIGITAL,IT IS MY FIRST AND HE ONLY THINGS THAT I MAY GO FOR NEXT TIME IS MAYBE MORE PIXS BUT A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE MONEY AND I HAVE EVEN TAKING PIC WHILE RIDING ON MY BIKE AND WITH THE IMAGE STABLIZER THAY STILL COME OUT GREART"
5,very good camera,"I bought this camera to replace an older fuji model. Can't say how big an improvement it is! The image stabilization is a god-send! The only thing I've got to say negativly about it...the digital zoom is a bit hard to control, but for most things, the regular optical zoom is plenty.Very good camera, and I would highly recommend it as a great starter camera."
2,Bad picture quality,"I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low. You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black. Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level! What a disappointment. I am going to try to return it."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,"When I ordered this camera from AMAZON the price was comparable to local establishments. The only reason I ordered from AMAZON was that there was a tag on the web page that said if you order this item you will get a free SD 512 memory card. This also appeared on the Kodak Z650 add on AMAZON. I did not recieve the card and when I inquired to AMAZON they answered that a card does not come with the Kodak Camera. Well, I knew that! The card was a give away from AMAZON not from Kodak. My biggest mistake, aside from ordering electronics from AMAZON was not saving the web page to prove my claim. Watch out for the bait and switch. Now AMAZON can do it too."
2,Unreliable,Owned this camera less than 1 year and its in the shop for the second time. Customer support was okay the first time but sucks now because they put me on hold for so long that I didn't get the issues resolved. I'm willing to try another Z612 before switching brands because I love the picture quality and the ease of operation.
4,Great Camera,"I am happy with this item, at the price paidI am delighted with the quality of the Pictures taken so far"
3,"Easy to use, except the zoom","I've had this camera since 10/06. It is very intuitive and easy to use with the exception of the zoom, which is very jerky. This means that instead of being able to zoom until you are satisfied, it jerks past where you want to go. When you try to go back a little, it jerks way past where you would want to stop.I am also having to return this one to the manufacturer for repair under warranty. When I try to do video, the camera makes grinding noises as it tries to focus and you can hear the noise on the video. I sincerely hope that is not how the camera is supposed to operate.But the images from the lense and 6.1 megapixel camera are excellent and Kodak software is easy to use."
1,"Some nice images, but some very blurry","I got some very nice photos with this camera, and some very disappointing ones, too. Even not using the zoom, I ended up with some very blurry pictures. This is not my first digital camera. I am unsure as to whether or not the camera is broken. Judging from other reviewers, I am guessing I just got a defective camera."
2,Not Very Sturdy,"I have two large lab mix dogs and while it was tall enough, this item is not very sturdy and is easily knocked over. I had to move this from inside to outside, due to the fit of the bowls and spillage. They barely cover the frame, so it's easy for the dogs to knock the bowls out of the holders. If the unit base was more sturdy, I would have been much happier. It also has a tendency to rust quickly."
3,it's quirky and a conversation piece,But really for those who are into quirky type of things. There's not much bang for your buck.
3,It's ok,Not really what I thought it would be... next time will go to a Book Store to puchase items like this
5,usable for pair of plastic glasses,Yes a good product - I bought it to use for removing coating on two pairs of glasses - one turned out very fine and the other pair only a little better than before - fast and good shipping - thank you :-)
3,Packaging !,"Hello, I didn't have the chance to try it yet,But the package came with a piece of Blond hair,Did not really appreciate that ,felt dirty"
5,girl reviewers don't get this book,"the girl reviewers don't get this book, at least i don't think so. ok so i'ma guy, so maybe i don't know what they know. but why do they go on and on about jasper? dorjan is the best fantasy hero i've ever read, not jasper. butsomehow dorjan gets no respect, or at least not the kind ov respect he should have with all his powers and what he does in the book. ok so that's it,i guess read it and decide."
3,"Cool ideas, no development.","I read the reviews for this book and decided to go against the naysayer and read it. At first I had very high hopes for this book. I'm always on the lookout for new ways of creating a magical environment, this book didn't completely disappoint. Some really cool ideas were brought forth here. They just were not fully developed. Had it been more thoroughly developed, this book could easily have been a captivating 600-plus pages. As it is, it is what my mom and I call ""a slider"", doesn't take a lot of time and thought, doesn't stick with you, doesn't effect you much, just a way to pass some time while you are looking for that truly amazing book to come along. Even though the target market is young adults (I believe), I think young people these days are a tad more sophisticated and could grasp a more fully developed plot and character."
2,A Huge Departure from Seer and the Sword,"If you were in love with the pure, vivid world that Hanley created in The Seer and the Sword, approach Healer's Keep with caution. Those expecting a smooth continuation with the series may find themselves disapointed. Healer's Keep throws the reader into a new sort of place where magic is no longer a rare and mystical thing, but something found on every page; full of rules and protocol. I was disappointed to see such a promising series get bogged down into the complexities of one of those sprawling systems of magic so common in mediocre fantasy. Perhaps drawing on the life force of the rest of the novel, it sucked the spark out of characters and plot, leaving this read far less enjoyable than its older sister."
5,loved it,"I loved it even more than The Seer and the Sword. There was so much going on in this book, I could read it over and over. The dream stuff, that there were four main characters and each one was fabulous. The plot is not the same old thing you've read a million times before, it has stuff in there completely different."
5,Worth Every Word,"This book hits a nerve with me! Evil people can prey on the innocent. What happens when they do? What kind of character is needed to overcome the experience of being preyed on? This book addresses these questions. It's so important for kids to learn about these sorts of things. I felt the characters were real people kids could relate to--and so could I, (an adult), which is why this book went so deep with me.A correction on the previous review is due to the cover artist of the paperback version of Healer's Keep, Greg Spalenka. The previous reviewer mistook Mr. Spalenka's fantastic original artwork for 'computer graphics'-art credit listed in the book. (They also mistook Ms. Hanley's wonderful storytelling for 'bad writing'.)This is an excellent book that I think offers great insights into the world today. Well-written and very entertaining!"
2,You have got to be kidding,I bought this because of all of the rave reviews on the book. I feel compelled to give an contrarian view...I like simple recipes but the ones in this book are extremely primitive .. not at all worth the $$
4,fruit picker,bought it as a gift and they used it as intended so it was a good investment for them to have.
3,European point of view,"There are 2 parts on this movie that, from an European guy's point of view, made me rub my eyes in shocking awe:1.- A KID asking for votes for Obama over the phone! A KID!!? (around 8 years old). How can a boy understand the world of politics, and support a candidate (ANY candidate) when be knows nothing about life! I'm pretty sure this would be illegal in many countries in Europe, even if he's doing that ""job"" for no money and out of symphathy.2.- Check out this sentence: ""We just got word that Oceola Townshi and Owen County...that the clerck there is not allowing people to vote if they don't have ID, whick obviously is illegal"" Wait a second! In Europe it's illegal to vote WITHOUT ID!! Which make more sense..."
4,How Our Brilliant President Was Elected,"WARNING: Highly biased review. I'm a volunteer for Obama 2012.Back-stage access, some intimate views of the campaign process and something I had not seen before: inside the Iowa caucus rooms. I hadn't really thought about it before, but the caucus is the exact opposite of the secret ballot. In Iowa, you literally stand up to be counted.Get a good taste of the ""Yes We Can"" enthusiasm from 2008, because we've got to do it all again in 2012. Yes, we can and we must."
2,Not quite what I expected,"As I am researching my family tree, I thought that this book would be helpful in putting the peices together. Unfortunately the methods used to transfer the origional text to this version are very inneffective. I realize that it was describes as such prior to purchase, but was unaware that entire paragraphs would end abruptly or words would be unidentifiable. Also despite having some valuable information about the Hanna orgins in Scotland and Ireland, anyone looking to this book for information in regards to the Hanna family of Washington County, Pa be aware that, according to this book, there is no documentation. Don't waste your time or money."
2,a long essay mostly on 'Blood Meridian',This book is more of a long essay (100 pages?) mostly concerning 'Blood Meridian' which I think is the least interesting of the so-called 'Western' novels. It does contain interesting material and a lot of research went into it.
1,Horror-able Quality,Photos are terrible quality. I can not believe Forry would allow his name to be associated with such a poor effort.
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY!!!!!,I love Forry to death and was looking foward to an incredible archive of photos. What is in this book are horrible scans. First off the cover of the book was not printed at 300 dpi and lines are all jagged and blurry. The photos inside are barely visible. I'm shocked that Forry let this out being a publisher himself.
3,Wonderful archive - not so wonderful reproduction,"I'm a bif fan of vintage fandom - the type, pre-internet, where things had to be searched down and when a ""find"" was all the more exciting because of it. The material contained within the pages of this book is A1 quality - views of the Ackermansion in its heyday, Forry with a host of fabulous fanatics - truly wonderful stuff. However this material is let down by poor quality reproductions. One review states there are new and improved higher resolution photos - I'd hate to have seen them before the ""improvement"". All this said, the book does warrant a purchase for Forry fans and those interested in vintage fandom."
2,To The Publisher: Get A New Xerox Machine,"This is actually a nice photo record of Forrest Ackerman's visit to our planet - 70+ years and counting. Problem is, a number of the photos are poorly reproduced, and from what I could tell, not because of the originals. I still recommend it though if your a die hard Ackerfan."
5,A Building Adventure,"Producers Kelly and Rosana Hart have come up with another winner. They've already given us the definitive video on alternative architecture, ""A Sampler of Alternative Homes,"" but this is their personal story. From a base of sand, cactus and brush in Colorado's San Luis Valley arose a beautiful home made almost exclusively out of crushed rock and old copies of the local newspaper. There were mishaps along the way, true, but Rome wasn't built in a day, so there's no need to impose stricter standards on earthbag houses. As the cost of conventional construction materials and the levels of carbon in the atmosphere continue their disturbing rise, this visionary DVD points to a future where buildings (one of the largest contributors to global warming) don't hurt the very Earth they stand on and the new worth of those who just want a little shelter."
2,Not so great,"I liked the idea of an FM radio built into the mp3 player and the FM Transmitter sounded cool too. It's a tiny little package that works great playing MP3's, loud enough with good sound quality. In FM mode you don't get nearly as much volume as when playing MP3's, but it sounds OK. The FM transmitter function is useless and sounds terrible. Overall, I was not pleased enough to keep this and will look for another."
1,"For once, I agree with the Crumudgeon","Usually I don't agree with the Curmudgeon, but I'm willing to make an exception (I do like Madonna, though, so this is my second exception). This is the most mind-bogglingly ANNOYING thing to ever (dis)grace the charts. My GOD! If the cheap synths don't turn u away, then the mutant-sounding beeping will. I long for the day when this evil craze is over, so music can finally take a breath of fresh air."
2,"I Can Take The Radio Edit, Just Not The Other Versions","""Axel F"" by Crazy Frog is one of my favorite songs lately. It isalso a popular ringtone and beat out Coldplay. I hear it all thetime on Radio Disney and it is good, but slightly annoying. I can stand the radio edit, however, I cannot stand the remixes! The radio edit is the real version of the song and the best oneon here. The bounce mix is not all that great, and I say about the same for the instrumental bounce mix. The resevoir frog remix, OMG! This is just terribly awful. I do enjoy the video, however as it is just plain hilarious! Though I would say you would be better off downloading the original off of the Internetand refraining from this CD single."
3,Just can't get enough of it!,"This is a great chance to see what music is all about! You may listen to one track sevral times and it gets stuck in your head...some people would think of this as a bad thing, but considering that Crazy Frog gives you entertainment and a good laugh all packed into one CD it's great! I'm the living proof that it's worth it all the way through."
2,K'Nex Electronic Arcade,"My 10 year old son spent every day for 3 days after school stopping only to eat dinner building this game. After all of that hard work, we could not get the game to work properly and had to take it back. Too many of the moving parts worked only part of the time or not at all. I felt so bad for him after all the time he spent and he was so disappointed."
1,doesn't work,"I read many of the reviews before purchasing this gift for my extremely bright 14 year old son last Christmas. He enjoys building things, and has the K'nex ferris wheel on his bureau. He spent many hours of vacation putting it together, and could not figure why it would not work. Last week (mid-September), he dismantled it, put the k'nex pieces in a box, and threw away the arcade parts. This was an expensive waste of time and money (and it took up a lot of space in his room). The customer reviews are here for a reason, heed them!"
2,Worst Knex toy so far,"We have had years of experience with Knex toys, typically they are incredibly thought out and lots of fun. Knex Electornic Arcade is a disaster. Once again the instructions are great and as always the pieces are a bit difficult to snap together, but the finnished product is awful. The pinball game is pitiful. the center wheel bearly spins due to poor design. The flippers are designed with a flaw that catches the ball which make you have to move it back on the board to continue play. The internal serial jacks are suspect as well, making for intermittent electrical connections. Knex is a great toy, just not this one."
5,Awsome!,Great toy. I encountered none of the problems mentioned in other reveiws; the center spinner spun freely and at high speed and the ball seldom if ever gets stuck. I am experienced knex builder and found this toy to be of their usual high standards. I would recommend it.
3,more memoirs than recipes,"This cookbook was more memoirs than recipes. There were very few recipes for very common swedish items such as swedish crisp bread ( a staple). This is NOT a reference book. It is merely following a wealthy woman's travels while enjoying Swedish food. Her memoirs were somewhat interesting, but it became repetitive towards the middle of her book. Some of the recipes were accurate."
4,More Questions Please,"If you enjoy playing Trivial Pursuit this game is not for you. Although the questions will challenge you, you will soon discover that you are repeating the same questions before the night is over. For the price one should expect the number of questions that came with the Genus editions."
2,NOW you'll know it all.,"Keep in mind that most Trivial Pursuit games and card sets come with 6,000 questions--NOT the mere 1,000 this set offers. With two people playing, you can start to get repeat questions within the course of a mere 2 games. The questions themselves are not bad--they are challenging--but the set really should cost about $2.50, not $20. I was pretty thoroughly disappointed when this set arrived, and I'd discourage most people from buying it."
2,"[Trivial Pursuit ""Know-It-All"" Edition]","I thought I was getting two boxes of cards as I did with the other editions (i.e., baby boomer, silver screen, rpm). Instead, for the same cost, it came with less than a half a box of cards in the same sized box. I had also thought, given the title, ""Know It All"", that the questions would be really tough. The questions are no harder than the original genus edition. I am VERY dissapointed with this version."
2,What a Waste of Money...,"Although the game is entitled ""Know it All"" Edition, I was bitterly disappointed with the level of difficulty. Expecting a challenge, I was greeted with the same old junior high school type general knowledge questions. What made things worse, was that after only one and one half games, the other player and I had already come back to the beginning of the deck. This edition would have been more aptly called, "" A Few More of the Same Questions for an Exhorbitant Price""."
1,Not the same caliber as the original Trivial Pursuit,"I don't know if Trivial Pursuit sold the rights to its brand name following the success of the original game or what, but (in my opinion) NONE of the other TP games has ever measured up to the first.Unlike the original, where well-written questions were often intuitive (if you thought hard enough) or at least very interesting if you didn't know the answer, the questions in this game are poorly phrased (and at times misleading) and BORING!!!What a shame!"
1,Complete waste of money,"You're paying ... for half a handful of trivial pursuits that you'll exhaust in one game. In addition, the questions aren't at the same level as normal Genus edition -- they ask questions about people and things you probably haven't heard of. Jeopardy champions would have difficulty answering these questions."
1,Such a Disappointment,"For years, if Iris Johansen's name was on a book, I bought it. She had beautifully developed characters, original plotlines, and something different to bring to her genre. This is just a cheap romance novel; I'm stunned she would put something like this out."
4,Sexy Sedikhan Story,"This is another wonderful Iris Johansen romp through the desert. Daniel (huge barbarian mercenary, VERY sexy) is sent to rescue Zara (sweet innocent college graduate) from terrorists in Said Ababa. He mistakenly believes that she is David's lover (David, hero from Touch the Horizon). However, she is not and her secret past causes some miscommunication that almost tears them apart.If you have followed her Sedikhan series, this is a must have. This also sets up Philip & Pandora's story in ....And the Desert Blooms (#126). Great sex, fun characters and exotic locales...what more can you ask for?"
2,The plot changes... and changes,The book's plot first tells us about some kidnappers... and you'll get zilch about that story.Then the love story starts so abrupt... that you won't believe it.After that you'll hear of her problem... and you'll read a dull story.And then you'll finish the book and that will be perfect because you'll not have to open it again.
3,Good Read,"Like most of this author's earlier romances, this is Category-short, sprinkled with humor, filled with characters that you can invest in, and laced with an intensity that tends toward melodrama, yet always manages to please.I love these old Loveswepts off Johansen's backlist going digital, but I only buy them when they are on special. The prices are usually ridiculous: two and three times what they cost when I first bought them 25 years ago. They are double what they would be if they were a new Category being published today! If she and her publisher would drop the ebook prices to reasonable, I would re-buy every single one of them."
5,Great book,I first read this book in 1985 when it was first released. It was as good than as it is now. I reread it because I just finished reading Blue Velvet where Daniel first appears. In that book you get Daniel's background. Blue Velvet was a good book too and was a sequel to White Satin. All 3 books were 5s.
1,Bell door,"I bought this product due to it say 8 inches by 8 inches on the product description but in reality is 1 inch by 1 inch, they need to fix that."
4,Mini farrier with the right gear!!,"Another real life moveable doll that adds reality, fun, and education, to breyer horse collecting and play.Put collecting first,and play second.Rough play may render item short lived.I would also say the vet for the girls and farrier for the boys...??Love the little horse shoes."
4,jake farrier,"Jakes tools are very small and are easy to lose,but I have not lost any of them.I keep them safe in the barn.I have had the doll for about seven months.He is great!"
2,Not an interesting read,"Author assumes she knows all about the reader's attitudes. Only one point of view is given in the book - assumes 100% Dom 100% of the time. Bad language is used in the book - the points could have been put across without using bad language. However, the best part of the book was the chapter on tools used in the trade.If this was my first book on Dom, it would have been my last since this book would have removed any / all interest. I will not keep this book in my library."
2,Maybe mine is a dud?,"We bought this swing three months ago and almost immediately, the orange fabric came off of one side but since it's decorative, I didn't think it was a big deal. Then I started noticing little white pellets in the carpet (our swing is inside) and it turns out that the seam on the side had also come undone. It is going to break my son's heart, but I am returning it as it is too expensive to keep if it's not going to last us another three months.However, since no one else has mentioned having problems with the craftsmanship, I will say that my 3 yr old son LOVES this swing and it seems to be very, very comfortable as it molds to his bottom. Not to mention that the wings are super cute."
5,swing with wings,"Awesome swing. Love it and more importantly the grandkids do! Very durable, so unique and comfortable. Kids pretend they are a butterfly and bumblebee on it. Best swing ever."
3,Ordered THREE times. Each book damaged!,"I REALLY wanted this book as a souvenir. It's an excellent book! Gorgeous photos! But I could not receive a copy from Amazon that wasn't badly damaged. Had to go through the hassle of returning & re-ordering, until I gave up!"
3,Two out of three aren't bad!,"I knew what I was getting into when I bought it...you don't go buying a three pack of any sci-fi (sorry SyFy) movies without knowing you're getting a set of b-movies...Hybrid was the most interesting of the three, with it's blending of typical werewolf story and mystical experiences, I liked that one a lot.Hellhounds was the one I was more interested in initially, it's more fantasy than horror/sci-fi. The Hellhounds of the title are barely in it, and quite frankly not as important as the sword & sorcery theme of a descent into the underworld to rescue a lost love while dealing with treachery and jealousy. Nothing spectacular, but not a bad bit of fantasy fiction.Grizzly Rage was, to be frank, just stupid and bad. It is the worst stereotype of the carefree kids do something stupid, get in trouble, and do more stupid things repeatedly while being stalked by a grizzly bear who does very few things the way an actual bear would."
5,Grizzly Horror,"Grizzly rage is a marvellous movie, The performance of the actors is great and entertaining, The story line is different and worth 10 out of 10 for the entire movie, sit on your edge of suspense and wait for things to happen. I loved the bear as well. Robyn"
4,Better than a rock!,I really liked the idea of a multifunction spare key hiding place. Everyone has seen the rock to place you key in. Most don't look real and if it gets kicked over anyone can see your key. This gives me more unusual place and a functional thermometer.
1,So wrong,"This entry is messed up in so many ways, I barely know where to begin.The photographs show two completely different saw blades, one with 40 carbide teeth, one with 140 steel teeth.The 140-tooth blades are not part of Milwaukee's Endurance line.The review is about another blade entirely.The manufacturer's description talks about C3 carbide, while it is clear that the featured blade is plain steel.If I ordered this item, I would have no idea what I might actually get."
5,Sharp,"These blades are sharp and look like they can rip through anything. They arrived earlier than expected, minimally wrapped but well protected. I am waiting for my circular saw (Milwaukee) to arrive on Monday. My last circular saw was fairly new but had a hard time cutting through pressure treated 4""x6"" lumber, that's why its being replaced. I'll write a more thorough review when the Milwaukee worm drive saw arrives. The blades appear to be very high quality but only using them will indicate how good they are. The price was very good, I may order at least two more."
3,A Poor Imation,"This book is a rather weak imitation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Written in the first person, it causes the reader to feel rather stupid. The unnecessary romantic insertions are nothing more than a concession to the current publishing house requirement of sexual episodes. The author's knowledge of Victorian London is extensive as is his acquaitance with the literature of the period.The unreal detective leaves the reader cold, as does the plot."
4,Well done!,"A very interesting book in light of the times in which we live. The story is told by Llywelyn, which gives it a humanity and personal view as he talks about his fears and insecurities. Barker is an enigmatic, but we learn about him as does Llywelyn. I very much enjoy developing relationship between the two characters. The author has clearly done his research of the time and includes a literary figure as a secondary character. The writing is excellent with some of the best first lines, in the prologue and first chapter, I've read in a long time. I would read the series in order but this was a very good read in, what looks to be, a wonderful new historical mystery series."
3,just about average,"This was an o.k. book. It didn't help me very much, but it had good tests. They made a lot of mistakes, which could have been avoided. The writers probably didn't put their best into it."
4,light up pens,Satisfied with the product and the speediness of shipment. This item is not easy to find.
5,super engine...grasshopper replacement,Don't let the picture lead you to believe that's what you will receive. It will come as the red model pictured elsewhere on this site. It will work for a grasshopper replacement. Minor mode works like champ. Previous engine was a 16 HP Vanguard and was 18 years old.Stick with briggs and you can't go wrong.
1,not useable for my audience,I did not feel that the topic fit with the animation. It simply would not work with a general audience. Perhaps it might work in some specific situations?
5,"Totally blows away any of these ""popular"" bands..","Though this isn't really ""black"" metal, it's got enough influence to be classified as that. No, it's more like ""dark"" metal, meaning it's a whole lot more evil than horrible little bands like Dimmu Borgir or Cradle of Filth. ...And so the Night Became has some death qualities to it meaning it's pretty brutal at times,and peaceful and beautiful at other times. This is a long CD, about an hour long, yet it doesn't seem to drag at all. There's so much diversity on this album it's incredible. Standout songs are ""There's no wine like the blood's Crimson"", ""Warrior of the Cresent Moon"", and ""...And so the Night Became"". You definitely need to get this album, and may i also suggest ""Shadows of Old"" and the new ""Ascension's of Terror""."
5,Wow....,"This may very well be the most perfect album ever made. The intro is a bit lackluster, but it's far more winding and morose than is the norm for black metal. I like how they do the tribal drum thing for a while, then you hear the sound of falling rain, and then a thick layer of heavily distorted guitars rips into you with the force of a steamroller. Aeternus has the heaviest, most crushing guitar sound of any black metal band I've ever heard. Awesome. The drums are flawless, but the real focus of this album has to be the guitars. Simply amazing. Aeternus is simply crushing, and yet, they use more acoustic guitars in one album than most black metal bands use in their whole careers. I just love the medieval sounding acoustic track that closes out the album. Bottom line is, if you're looking for a really obscure black metal band that should be far more popular than they are, then get this cd. It doesn't disappoint."
1,Please be aware...,"Please be aware that Sun Bear is not well regarded among Ojibway peoples. He is considered to have been a ""plastic medicine man,"" which means he willingly adopted the new-age stereotype of Shamanism (knowing it to be artificial the whole time) to gain credulity and favor among non-Native disciples/customers. His work is not accurate in any representation of Ojibway--or any other indigenous--tradition, and Sun Bear was not at all active in the ceremonies of the very people he claimed to represent."
5,FABULOUS JUICER!,"This machine exceeded my expectations! It is unbelievably quiet, the juice is yummy & healthy, the pulp is good for smoothies & soups, and cleanup is a piece of cake -- nothing is greasy, so you just scrape the pulp into your storage container, rinse the parts, brush the screen with the included veggie brush, & put it in the dish drainer. Why bother with the dishwasher? One tip: buy the cheap bags of the little apples. Another tip: if multiple people want different kind of juices, do the simple sweet ones first, followed by anything savory or exotic -- then clean just once. My goal is to use it at least once a day ... I think I'll go buy some tomatoes right now!"
3,Not the best product.,"The concept is great of juicing your way to health but the design has alot to be desired. If you're not careful, you will wind up with pulp all over the walls. So not only are you cleaning the juicer but spending extra time cleaning the walls too. The info-mercial raves about how little pulp there is in the collector unit but what they fail to show you is how much also accumulates on the underside of the top piece of the unit. The big selling point was the 3 easy payments. I thought about returning it within the first 30 days but figured since I paid so much for shipping, I might as well keep it and deal with the shortcomings. Juicing is still a good option.Note: I also have another Braun juicer from 20 years ago or so and it still works great and there's no chance of the pulp hitting the walls on that one. The only thing with this one is that the chute is very small. I will be taking this juicer to the office so I can juice at work."
2,Powerless Juicer,I purchased the jack lalanne`s juicer and only used it three times and the motor stopped and just started humming while I was juicing some beet roots. When I tried to restart it all it did was just hum and would not start back up. So I returned it back to amazon. The only good experience I received was the no hassel return from amazon which will keep me as a customer. I had also returned an instyler product before with no hassel. After returning the juicer I purchased the breville juice fountain elite. It cost more and now I know why. It is totally awesome and extremely powerful and easier to clean. My recommendation would be to spend the extra money and get way more than you will pay for. Watch this juicer in action on [...] with Martha Stewart.
2,so disappointed.....,I bought this juicer about a two weeks ago. It worked fine at first and then it started stalling and the motor started getting louder by the day. It stopped working at one point so i returned it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,juicing is the way to go.,"I bought this product a few weeks ago and have been using it ever since.I find it easy to put together and take apart for cleaning, you must be careful with the bin though or you can have the fibrous part of the fruits and vegetables all over your counter.I would recommend this product to anyone needing a juicer.The juice is realy delicious and fresh."
1,Motor died after 30 uses,"I purchased this unit directly from Lalanne's website. My elderly mother had a lung transplant in 2008. I bought this for her, to improve her health with a wider variety of vegetables and fruits. She didn't care for juicers because the juices can be very acidic and hard on her stomach. I used carrots, apples, celery, beets, and many other foods following Jack's juicer book recipes. I made two 20 oz juices ONCE A WEEK. By week 15 the motor burned out. I called the factory and told them what happened. They diagnosed the problem apologized. I never registered for warranty work so I gave up on getting a warranty replacement or repair. The other issue was the location of the juice spout. It was way too low. All of my glasses are standard tall sized. 5 oz is not acceptable. I had to put the machine on a big phone book. Silly. I don't recommend this juicer for anyone."
5,Awesome juicer,This juicer was a great investment in my fmailies health. The motor is quiet and it performs great. I am very pleased with my purchase.
5,One Great Juicer,I really enjoy the Jack Lalanne juicer. I find it very well made and easy to clean although it takes a few minutes to do so.I just spray it with kitchen sink sprayer and that's it. I'm a chronic pain sufferer and I have to take medicines that at times bind me up.Since I've been using this product my fiber intake has gone up considerably which has solved this problem. And their are obviously many other health benefits of juiceing.The one draw back is you have to be careful of your calorie intake because of the sugars you will naturaly get from some of the fruits.I do believe that the benefits far out way the draw backs as long as your aware of them and I highly recommend juiceing as well as this product.Sincerely - Marc Richard
2,"Ads are enticing as always, product not different from any other!","Compared to a standard economical Juicer that I had before and using for years, this is not any better! Juicing is same, but the worst part is the motor get jammed every time. Not that good!"
4,"Very quiet, great juice","This works very well. I love how quiet it is and how quick and easy it is to clean. I have not had another juicer so I do not know if the amount of juice it gets out is high or not. Note, it says not to put bananas or avocados into the machine but what I do is after I have made juice from apples, carrots, oranges, etc., I will cut a banana up and drop it into the juice and use a hand immersion blender to mix it in so not a problem. We've started having a juice every day which equates to at least five servings of fruits/ veggies. Awesome."
1,real disappointment,too heavy to even lift from the box and Massive! too large for my kitchen. I returned it.
4,I liked it. So much to clean up!,I liked it...... There was so much to clean up! Now I use a vitamin. It is much more simple.
2,Jack it does not live up to your name,"I thought this was going to be a great healthy change. Unit is nice. It does not juice every type of fruit. You have to cut up alot of the fruit/Veggies in order for it to juice. I am not sure who stated clean up is a snap. It is a pain in the ass. Time consuming and the plup is all thrown away. What a waste that is where most of the nutirents are. I had it a couple of weeks and totally not satisfied, call them up and stated I was sending it back and the bottome line was I would get about 32.00 back out of the 140.00 I paid due to shipping and processing and all that crap. I just kept it and it sits on the bottom of a pile in my garage. Probably where is belongs. What a major disappointment. Anyone who says its great ect... is out of their minds."
3,Jack LaLanne Juicer,I knew this product because I used to own a Jack Lalanne juicer and I loved it.Unfortunately I had to return this particular kind because the material was not what I expected.The company responded quickly for my return and gave a refund right away.I was pleased with that.I'll still recommend Jack Lalanne juicer to everybody.
1,Buy Omega,"It is a wonderful looking machine, but it doesn't work. There is an automatic shut-off switch and you cannot keep this machine running.As soon as I fed a carrot into the machine, it stopped running. Then you must wait 10 minutes for it to operate again. This occurreda number of times. I called the tech and he gave me instructions, but I could not keep the machine running. After much frustration, I gave up and returned it. I bought an Omega juicer and it is wonderful. It works! If it does jam, there is a reset button on the bottom of the machine, no waiting for 10 minutes to run again. I did not need it because the juicer kept running. It was the same type of juicer as the LaLane model, but it just works. I never did see how the LaLane juicer works because I could not get it to keep running long enough. I admire Jack LaLane, but whoever designs his juicers had better go to square one."
4,Jack Lalanne's JLSS Power Juicer,"This juicer works surprisingly well. Have tried various juicers before and was very dissatisfied. I had lots of citrus (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit and tangeloes) to be juiced and was finished much sooner than I expected. The pulp and rinds were perfect for my compost pile and the juice was excellent fresh as well as frozen."
2,disappointed,"I am very disappointed with the Jack juicer. I don't mind the cleaning and think its much easier to just hand wash instead of dishwasher, but my disappointment is in the pulp. I get alot of wet pulp most of the time. I thought there'd be less pulp and drier as the commercial claims. I'm concerned about all that wasted nutrition thats going into the trash instead of in my stomach. I'd love to ask him why he makes these claims about % more juice than other juicers et cetera. I like the juice and like that its fresh and without added sugar and all sorts but theres so much waste!"
1,Wasted fruit and money.,"I have to agree with others who have said this machine is wasteful. When Jack mentions you can extract more juice for just pennies I thought, ""Hey why not give it a try."" However, after trying this product we can't justify the cost since we buy organic fruit. By the time the juicer is done most of what you and I would eat ends up in the pulp collector and we're rewarded with only a measly amount of juice.Not to mention that there is over six pieces to clean after each use. Moreover in the TV infomercial Jack puts whole fruits in the juicer with piths, leaves, and even the stems. In reality, the instructions advise you against doing such a thing. Overall, in the long run it would be more cost effective and healthier if you just stuck with your blender."
2,Very disappointed.,"Although this juicer does have some nice features notably a large spout and quiet operation, it only works well on hard, firm foods such as celery and large carrots. It jams with the small carrots and it is absolutely lousy at spinach and broccoli. It basically just cuts up spinach into small pieces and spews them out into the bin for the fiber. Our eight-year-old miracle juicer even with its small spout and noisy motor does a much better job!"
1,one carrot and the motor blew-very dissapointing- I should have listened to the reviews,"I did a lot of research on juicers and all signs point to not buying this juicer. But the infomercials made we want to try it. So I bought one at a decent price and after spedning a good deal of time putting it together and learning how to use it I put one carrot in it and the motor blew, smoke came out, and my JLL juicer was dead.I almost gave it a second chance by getting a replacement but after more research and contemplation I decided to go with the Breville and it is awesome!! Save yourself sometime and don't buy the JLL juicer."
1,Stopped Working After 2 Weeks!,"I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago and used it maybe 3-5 times per week. Not a whole lot. I juiced carrots, apples, lemons, cucumber, pear, grapes, blackberries, blueberries, celery, kale, beet, radish, strawberries, & red cabbage. Nothing too crazy. Well, the last time I used it, I was pushing a carrot down the mouth when it suddenly stopped working. I figured it just needed to cool down, so I unplugged it and didn't use it for a couple of days. Well, I'm now ready to use it again and now it completely will not turn on! It is plugged in and the switch lights up, but no movement w/ the machine whatsoever. It hasn't even been long since I purchased it! I am wrapping this thing up and returning it today. Words cannot describe my frustration w/ this crappy device! Save your money/time...don't waste it on this particular juicer."
1,"Don't buy, it's junk!","This is my second juicer. This machine is aggrivatingly unusable. The motor is very weak, it jams with everything I've put in it, including soft stuff like cilantro and celery!! The plastic chute starts getting eaten by the blade with a moderate amount of pressure, which means I hope you like little bits of plastic in your juice. Another irritating design is that the juice spout is so low I can only get a short glass under it. I guess that doesn't matter now because I'm not going to use it any more anyway. You also need a special tool to remove the blade, which comes with, but makes disassembly annoying. Better not lose the tool!My first juicer, a little beginner Juiceman Jr., held up for over 10 years and was way more powerful. Would still be using but the chute cracked (my fault) and parts are no longer available :-("
1,Juices your counter,"This is a really really bad juicer! Mine leaked all over the counter. We were going to trow it away, but my wife decided to give it to a charity with a note inside saying what a lousy juicer this is/was. Save your money for something far better than this - it's underpowered as well and the parts are cheap cheap cheap. Complete rip off!"
1,very poor juicer,"I've only owned one juicer before so take it for what its worth. I just purchased this and used it for the first time today. I wasn't expecting much and still i was disappointed. the spout is too low to get even a small mug underneath is. also, the spout keeps clogging up. I mean every 2-3 seconds. and when you look at the pulp it's really wet. you'll see whole pieces of grapes not cut up. I consider this product absolute junk."
2,Not really what you expect,"I bought this item at [...] and it is good to juice oranges and carrots or any kind of hard vegetable or fruit, but when it comes to green leafy vegetables does not work at all, you will end up with all the leafs in the pulp container and 0 juice as a result, wasted money. This product is advertise as a dishwasher safe, but when I putted in the dishwasher the chute shrank and then every time I push down some fruit or veggie it doesn't come up easily, so end up really being a nightmare, I called Jack La Lane and they said I have to buy a new chute even do I have been only a few weeks with this product. Please buy a slow masticating juicer, much better juice quality, easy to clean, not any dangerous blades or parts, not noise at all, great quality."
1,Failed in less than 3 months,"I gave this as a gift to my Mother-in-law, and less than 3 months later, the unit does not work any more. It will not turn on. What's worse is that the seller is ignoring my request for assistance. If you can't do anything, at least tell me, don't just ignore me. I would not buy this product, or from this seller again."
3,dont turn it on without food in it.,"I bought one a while ago, the instructions said not to run it with no food in it, I obeyed that rule always, then one day I turned it on accidently for one second when it was empty, and it never worked again, too delicate, I lost the machine, and my money, so be careful, it could happen to anyone."
1,"Terrible juicer, and even worse customer service","This is not a good machine. The less expensive model is better (I have personally owned both). The thing blocks all the time making juicing a very long process... which first thing in the morning is not good. And then the motor broke twice, and each time I had to pay $40 for them to ship me a new one. Well the last time they sent me a defective one! In the end I trashed it and will invest in another brand. I am tired of having to keep giving them money for their crappy product. This brand is garbage- literally!"
4,LaLanne JLSS Power Juicer,"Ordered this when my old juicer, not a Jack LaLanne juicer broke down after almost two years of service. This one seems to be better made with more stainless parts. It runs a bit slower than my previous juicer but works very well and I think it's going to last longer than the previous one. What I like is it has an automatic shutoff if it jams and so far that has not been necessary but it is a nice feature."
3,Disapointed,"I have had a Jack Lalanne Juicer for many years. I recently upgraded to the deluxe stainless-steel model believing that the stainless steel would be on the inside where the juice is formed and captured. I was disappointed to find out that the stainles steel was on the outside only. I do not care what the outside finish is, my concern is the material that comes in contact with the juice. .Jack Lalanne's JLSS Power Juicer Deluxe Stainless-Steel Electric Juicer"
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm shocked by the good reviews for this thing. I suppose if you are only juicing small apples and small carrots it would be fine. I should have done more research before ""upgrading"" to this machine. By appearance it looks industrial. I've only used it twice and am very disappointed with it and plan to return it.I juiced Kale which was almost impossible and got gummed up; carrots were difficult - they were moving constantly because the part that pushes them down is too long so you can't stabilize the carrots while they are juicing; cucumber ended up sideways and so a large piece of skin kept was lodged on the blade and kept other veggies from juicing properly. All in all a bad experience.Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Misleading Advertising,"When I received this product and take it apart I realized it was not so easy as they show on tv, to make different kind of juices, and also has so many parts to clean, that even if they said they were dishwasher safe, they would take almost all the upper part of the dishwasher.Also there were some fruits you cannot use and others, like bananas, totally forbiden.A complete fiasco and I returned it the following day.Sincerely, Alda Lagomarsino"
1,Motor of juicer just stopped not even finishing 1 glass of apple juice,"It took a while for my Power Juicer Pro to arrive since my cousin had to ship it from the US to the Philippines where I live.I was so excited to use the juicer but we haven't even finished making 1 glass of apple juice and the motor just stopped. It wouldn't start again and we don't know what to do. If we send the item back to the US through courier, it would cost as much as the juicer so we made the most expensive half glass of apple juice ever! There's no quality control and I wouldn't buy Jack Lalanne again!"
4,achieve expectation,The machine works well as expected as explained in the user's manualI enjoy using itI need to learn how to make use of the pulp and fibers
2,Bought and returned without using!,"I just bought this juicer last night from Walmart for about $130 Canadian. It's a nice looking flashy juicer, but after reading all the mixed reviews, I've decided to return it tonight. In fact, I went out and bought the Breville Juice Fountain Elite 800JEXL. It's over twice the price of the Lalane juicer, but the fit and finish is exceptional along with the performance and quality. Reviews here on the Breville are stellar. The Breville makes the Lalane juicer look and perform like a toy!So it's a few extra bucks more. Isn't it worth your health?!April 17, 2009; The Breville Juice Fountain Elite is working out just stellar! This juicer squezes out jugs of juice from it's variable speed motor (up to 13K rpm) in just minutes! REAL stainless steel materials and excellent set-up make it sturdy and a snap to clean up! I'm glad I didn't waste my money on that weak motor plasticy-parted La Lanne unit!"
1,wasteful machine,"I find this juicer very wasteful, it leaves the pulp extremely wet and it does not matter what type of vegetable or fruit is use. I don't recommend this machine to anyone."
2,Too much pulp left,"From watching advertisements for this product, I was lead to believe that it did not leave as much pulp as other juicers. I don't know what other juicers they are referring too but I was unpleasantly surprised at the amount of pulp being left behind. I returned the product for that reason."
1,"Jack Lalanne's JLSS Power Juicer Deluxe Electric Juicer, Stainless/Black","I have requested that your company refund my money and or credit my account for the $120.99. I haven't received my juicer and I want a credit. You shipped it to someone else it has been over a month, and I am not paying for it. As far as I am concerned I won't buy from ammazon again....please deal with it!"
4,Lotsa juice,"My sister bought the Jack Lalanne juicer for my mother, but she did want it so she gave it to me. I had been wanting one for a long time and was happy to get it. I am not disappointed. I haven't had any problems except for having to take everything apart to clean it every time and getting some of the pulp off of the mesh screen. Other than that, it works great! It makes a lot of juice and it's sturdy. I haven't had any problem with the motor or anything else, so those who did must have bought a defective one. I love it!"
2,product ok,"This product was just OK, if there were not so many parts to clean, it would be much better. Makes a lot of juice. Just OK"
1,"Only looks pretty, performance is horrible !","Totally agree with other 1-star reviewers- waist of food and money. If you care to get the most from your veggies and fruits (especially if you pay more for organic ones) -you don't wanna throw away the pulp that is so moist that you can squeeze more juice with your bare hands!.. Handles poorly hard vegetables like carrots and beets, only VERY small apples can fit whole without cutting, chokes a lot..-overall- bad experience!Do not recommend ..."
3,Not As Shown on Infocommerical,The shoot jams & boggs down. I have to stop & clear then start up again. This is no my first juicer.
4,Good Unit,The juicer is indeed very quiet and juices well. The only issue I have is that there are too many pieces to clean.
1,fairly good juicer; nasty customer service,"I think this is a fairly good juicer; but, the pusher was broken when I received it. It fills up with water when I wash it and the water stays inside the pusher without being able to come out. Customer service said I would have to pay 4.99 plus shipping and handling for a new pusher even though it was defective by their fault. They told me I would have to pack the whole machine and return it to where I purchased it if I would not agree to pay for a defective part that was their fault. I also gave it the 1 star rating because most of the machine is plastic made in China. Toxins from the plastic could supposedly leach into your juice. Also, toxic customer service is not a plus either."
1,"upgraded looks, same performance","The ""deluxe"" juicer is exactly the same as the regular Power Juicer except that it is black and silver. Note I say silver, not stainless steel, because most of the metalic parts are plastic. The motor is the same, as is the controls. Save your $$ and get the regular or upgrade to a Breville which gives you more juice with a finer grater and variable speeds for different fruits and veggies."
1,Lalanne's Juicer is Bad,The juicer looks good but that is about it. I was in a hurry when I purchased it but I wished I would have heeded the advice from the bad reviews for this juicer and purchased from a different manufacturer. I've only used it a dozen times and the rim cover broke off - it was glued on to the housing. The machine is poorly built: plastic coating is peeling off; parts are cracking and falling apart - it is all plastic; the motor is very touchy- it shuts down in the middle of the cycle and you have to take it apart to start it up again. Avoid this juicer or you will me very disappointed like I have been. I feel like it going to break down any time even though I have pampered it like a baby. I love drinking fresh juices so I am prepared to spend more money and purchase a better quality juicer. There are much better made juicers on the market!
5,Simply amazing!,"I went to a computer school for a 4 month class and wasted so much time, this dvd really only talks about whats important, hardware software everything and its really cheap its 2 dvd's in one case no complaints :-)"
3,Second chance at love.,"Bonny Fairley had been destroyed when her beloved husband, Timothy, decided his life in Pilchuck wasn't for him and neither was marriage. Bonny hasn't wanted a man since. Worried about their aunt-by-marriage, the Reilly twins take out a personal ad in the local paper. Bonny is not grateful until her ex-husband returns to win Bonny back. To keep her mind off Tim, Bonny decides to contact the men who respond to the ad.Tim seems to expect Bonny to forgive him instantly for abandoning her and must learn that while he now knows why he did what he did, and learned to move on, Bonny has not done either. Another good tale of life in Pilchuck."
5,Explorer Taillight,"I accidentally broke my truck's tailight when backing out of a very tight spot. Went to the junk-yard to find the part, but couldn't find any. I looked here and found a very cheap part, that fit my truck perfectly. Upon receiving it, I intalled it in three minutes, and now my truck looks brand new. GREAT BUY!"
5,Very Pleased,"auto store told me 84.99, ford dealership told me 95.00, collision centers told me 70.00.... can't beat $35.00 plus free shipping.. light is an exact match and literally took 3 minutes for me to unscrew my broken light housing out and replace it with this new one. i couldn't be any happier about this purchase.."
5,Tail light for 2002 Ford Explorer,This item arrived in 3 days. Opened the box and was very pleased with the quality of this replacement part. I saved better than half the price of the same item if purchased from a dealership. Had the new part on the vehicle in less than 5 minutes. I cannot tell the difference between the stock lense on the right from the replacement on the left.
1,Not good,"This is the same exact diaper as http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005N2QPZE/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i02. I do not recommend this item. The adhesive on the tabs does not always keep the diaper secure. Also, every single one we used leaked because the diapers shifted every time my dog squatted so she was able to urinate straight out of the tail hole; I think it is because the portion of the diaper that goes on her back is too long so it creates extra room allowing the diaper to move (I did buy the size recommended per my dog's waist measurement)."
4,She can bring you from laughter to tears and back again,"Slyvia Hotel is a personal CD which highlights the sensitivity of the artist. Highlights from the CD include The Days and Nights are Long, the title cut Slyvia Hotel and, for fun, check out Unworthy and the hidden track The Bank. A wonderful collection of songs.....so, pull up a chair and enjoy. Worth the long wait from her previous gem Mrs. Pinnochi's Guitar"
2,Disappointed by this one,"I love Cheryl Wheeler but this is the first CD of hers I have not played over and over again. I suppose maybe if I did it would grow on me, but I have not as nothing really caught my attention, other than the title as I like the Sylvia Hotel. Nothing much to say about this one, I'm afraid."
2,Yawn!,"Since WUMB came dangerously close to becoming the Cheryl Wheeler fan club I thought I might try an entire CD to see if they're on to something. What a snooze. Here we have her staple ""life on the road is lonely"" songs. The title song is good and she should have left the others out. Then we have some Michael Smith wannabe humor. O.K. let's take the guns away from schoolkids. We're glad to know where you stand Cheryl, how do we do it? Let's hang a mediocre lyric off a clever title twist in ""Right Way to Do the Wrong Thing"", that works all the time in Nashville. Boring, boring, boring. Where are my Patty Larkin discs?"
2,This is mostly filler,"Folks buying this one on the strength of the excellant title cut should watch out. The rest is throw away novelties and shallow song writing. Although she has a way with a ballad, Wheeler shows little of it here. There are a lot of strong female folk artists who have moved beyond songs about their cats and tunes based on The Mexican Hat Dance. Pretty lame."
1,Cheyl's worst yet,Its a mystery that someone who put out what I believe one of the best CD's ever by anyone (Driving Home) could put out such junk as this.
1,Mantovani Lovers Beware!,"Those weened on the Mantovani sound will be gravely disappointed with the arrangements on this CD. The overlapping lush string sound of the maestro's arrangements is missing from Roland Shaw's proclivities toward woodwinds and brass. This music can only appeal to those who actually like elevator music with little creativity and novelty. Ironically, many associated Mantovani's music in the late sixties with the elevator sound. This CD only lends credibility to those critics. Before his death, Mantovani knew that only certain songs were suitable for his string orchestra. He generally stuck to popular ""classics,"" not just popular as these selections are. For uplifting music that is strictly Mantovani, look elsewhere, for this music only takes Mantovani's name on a ride down."
2,Oh Geez! Why me!,"My daughter begged for this doll, and it had to sing this particular song. So why in the world do I get the one where the batteries are dead and that use some sort of watch battery that I can't find.I just don't understand why the batteries are already dead. Was one of Amazon's employees playing with it in the warehouse?Otherwise she's really cute, and not cut to the proportions of Barbie at all.My daughter had a really hard time finding clothes in Barbie's wardrobe that would fit her. ""Mommy, was is Hannah so much fatter than Barbie?"" LOL"
2,Noisy Doll,"I purchased this doll for my granddaughter who is 6. She loves Hannah Montana. She was excited, however, the singing by the doll is disturbingly loud and there is no way to lower the volume. It made us adults very annoyed to hear the same song over and over. My granddaughter, however, loved it. If you like peace and quiet, I wouldn't recommend this doll. There is a switch that allows you to play half the song, so that is a help, but Hannah sings too loudly!"
4,Made my little girl happy,"Hannah Hannah, Hannah is all we hear thanks to the Disney channel and my litle girl has been tickled pink since she received this along with a few other Hannah items. Great toy for little girls and so far seems to be pretty durable at least my 2 year son has not tore it up yet"
3,Could have been better,"This is an extemely cute doll. My daughter loves Hannah Montana and was thrilled to get it. However, the batteries were dead when we got it. The doll only made a deep murrering sound, kind of scary actually. We had to spend an extra $[...] to buy 4 watch size batteries to get it to work. Keep that in mind when ordering from Amazon. You can not test it before you buy it. You just mind end up sinking money into a brand new item. I would advise getting this doll from a normal retail store. That way you can test it and be sure it works. Especially since replacement batteries are hard to find and very costly."
5,5 Star Cards for Dogs!!!,"I am very excited to tell everyone that these cards are great!!! I gave a card to my moms dog (a Shiba Inu). He usually doesn't eat any sort of rawhide (very picky eater) but he was very excited about this one. He ate it right up! I am planning on ordering more to send out for Christmas, we'll see how other breeds like them!"
4,Nearly flawless compilation,"""Elements"" is an all-too-brief overview of this influential musician's remarkable career. Beginning with material from bands many have never heard of (Toe Fat, for example) and ending with recent recordings, Hensley's songwriting and keyboard skills carry a common theme, even in what now seems like an unlikely choice in Blackfoot. Of course, any true fan will find omissions that seem inexplicable, such as Stealin'; I was particularly struck by the absence of material from ""Glimpse of Glory"", one of his finest solo efforts. Perhaps Hensley's embrace of Christianity was too controversial for modern mores..who can say? While anyone interested in Hensley's career may have most of these selections already, ""Elements"" represents an outstanding introduction to this remarkable artist."
3,Home Made,"This book has a lot of Data, but page 171 is missing and has been replaced with page 26 but upside down."
3,"Good overall, but a lot of uninteresting articles.","This edition is merely excerpts from three older editions. Some of the articles are highly interesting. Few are hilarious. I have read this edition from cover to cover, and would recommend it but would advise to skip over many articles."
5,I love K'NEX,"I have had a KNEX set for 10 years or so. My daughter has always been envious of mine, and I don't let the kids play with it. She received money for christmas and bought this set. She has had a lot of fun putting together the models, however there are a couple of models in the book that there aren't quite enough pieces to build. If this were the only set in the house, it would be very disappointing to get as far as she did, then have to disassemble and start with another project."
4,Great gift for the nephew,"At first, I was a little hesitant since the gift is for my 10yr old nephew. It turns out that he loved it. It has a ton of gizmos and gadgets. My favorite attachment was the laser/scope. All in all - an excellent purchase. As a recommendation, do not buy a jug of pellets smaller than a 6k jug. By the end of Christmas night, the 8k pellet jug was already 2/3 of the way empty. I also recommend getting a magazine with a larger capacity. My nephew had to reload often."
3,"Looks great, breaks easy","For the money, it was worth it, it shoots okay, and looks great. Great starter BB gun. Do not plan to do anything with it other then display it, and do not drop it, the barrel will break."
4,Automatic King,This gun is the best gun ever!!!!!! It comes with a flash light and comes with scope. It is awsome!! The only thing that is a little bit bad about this gun is that there are alot of small pieces to assemble and a bit heavy. The laser is not included but over all it is awesome.
3,this gun is decent,ok the gun ok only thing is it only for beginners the stock has a large steal piece in it replace that with wood cause stock will break from the steal the hop up unit isn't that great and it the mag only holds 43 rounds backyard wars it ok for on beginers but not skirmishes
5,Awesome M4A1 airsoft gun!,"For all you COD fans, this M83 is really close to the M4A1 in COD MWII. It has two settings - semi-auto and full-auto, if you like to spray bullets around. Easy to load, and hasn't jammed at all since we have had it. Comes with a bunch of cool extras - flashlight, laser sight, and reflex sight. If you buy this, I recommend you get the extra mag since one mag holds about 40 pellets and on full auto it will run out really quickly. This is a definite good choice for anyone who is a casual airsoft user who wants a realistic military style gun."
4,Airsoft man,"This gun is great when I got it I was surprised at all the extra features that came with it. My only issue with it is the low capacity magazine (45 rounds) If the gun cam with a bigger magazine I would love this gun for the price but, it doesn't so thats why I'm giving it four stars.Great Gun"
4,"Decent gun, cheap price","I got this gun for my 10 yr. old and he has enjoyed it so far. Doesn't shoot quite as fast as advertised, which is fine with me so that no one gets hurt in their air soft wars! Sometimes the BBs get clogged and he has to dislodge them. It comes with a lot of fun accessories, however the instructions for assembling them is hard to understand. The lazer fell apart before he'd even used the gun and we haven't figured out yet how to get it to work. Overall, he's been quite pleased with the gun."
2,Beginners Gun,"This gun was okay when I first started using it. It's really a backyard gun, and should only be used for beginners. I had it on my bed, which is about two feet high, and it fell when my dog jumped on, the barrel broke. The spring in the magazine also broke. There are better guns out there, but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard, this is the gun for you. The sight is a pretty nice feature."
3,Eh then more Eh?!,"When i first received the item i was quite surprised at its weight, extremely realistic, but that pretty much ends the realism there. Everything is plastic, everything except maybe the mag which is like some plastic infused with tin foil or somethin but its pretty heavy. If you plan on going full auto then plan on buying a few more mags because you will need them. After about 2 hours of use i noticed that the bb's started to curve to the left, even with hop up off. on that note the hop up is extremely over corrective the bb's go about 10 feet then almost a 90 degree turn upwards, extremely insane. The only way the hop-up could be of use is maybe trying to shoot a squirrel while aiming at the ground."
2,The m16,"Well, when I ordered this thing, I was pumped, but when I got it and tried it it, I was pretty disappointed. The mags are probably the most irritating mags to reload, especially in battle. They are the type where you have to put the tube in and push the bb's down. You will have to buy at least 3 or 4 extra mags to survive on the battle field. Also, not only do the mags not hold very much, but the gun also has very little range and power(around 30-40 yards). I found that the only good thing about this gun is that it comes with a nice package. It contains a red dot, silencer, acog scope, charger, batteries, only one mag, grip, manual, and a few more little things. If you are really into air soft, I would advise not getting this gun, but if you are a beginner and you're looking for somewhere to start, go for it if you want something that is pretty inexpensive."
4,?????????????????????,does this gun have a charging rod and also how long does it tak e for it to chARge anhow many yards acan it shoot?
1,The Worest Deal EVER!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY WHAT EVER YOU DO!,"OK so i got this gun for christmas and i open it and i'm so excited. Then i play with it, its working then i go to charge it boom. 8 hours later its dead the gun will not work. I checked the battery it has full juice. I had my dad and uncles look and try to fix this for about 2 hours they could not figure it out. Currently my uncle is going to take the gun apart and try to fix it. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN OR ANY OTHER TOYS OR AIRSOFT GUNS FROM THIS COMPANY! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS IT IS A RIP OF AND THE COMPANY HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER REVIEWS! That is my review and i am a kid and im doing this on my moms name"
1,Arrived Broken!,"Let me first say we know how to operate airsoft guns...we own a few already. This gun never worked. It was my son's birthday gift; needless, to say it was a major disappointment. The return procedure is cumbersome to say the least and there is no guarantee it will be fixed or replaced (and we're to pay the return shipping). We would have been better off flushing $45 down the toi-toi. I don't recommend this gun."
5,good gun,this gun clip holds 40 45 rounds thats not bad the guys in vietnam holds 20 but they put in 16 because 20 bent the spring to far and doest push up and u want it more realistick real life you dont get a thousand rounds enless you have a m60 eneyways sens this gun has a hop up it shoots far enuf were i play {cattails} we get like 10 feet from e chuther we play with all tipes of fps 135 200 300 400 u should get this gun i won many wars with it we play with 20 peopleits not the gon its the person using the gun its all about takneek people with 300 fps guns arnt proply good so they buy high powerd guns kuz they suckand u can go to shorty usa click mags and for 10 bucks u can get 2 mags for this gun and thats with shipping 10 bucks good dil
1,sux,this gun sux. the fire setting swith jammed and the gear box snapped withen one hour. a complete waste of 30 bucks. never buy this
3,OK GUN....BAD ACCURACY,"THIS GUN IS A GOOD GUN ALTOGETHER, BUT THE ACCURACY IS NOT SO GREAT. AT ABOUT 20FT THE BBs BEGIN TO CURVE UP. THE GUN SHIPPED FAST, BUT IT BREAKS EASILY. I HAD MINE FOR FIVE DAYS BUT ON THE THIRD DAY THE BARREL BROKE OFF. IT ONLY HAS ABOUT 200FPS. IN MY OPINION ANYONE COULD GET A BETTER GUN, BUT THIS WAS GOOD FOR THE PRICE."
4,Good first-timers gun,"This is a good gun with long battery life and is easy to load. The only problem is that it has low fps of only 250, which makes it less accurate and less painful for opponents. Plastic parts. Hard to find battery. Still good gun overall."
3,M16 AEG,The only con I have about the product is the fact that no matter how much you play with it the red dot never centers with the target and the BB's tend to go up the farther you are from the target. (tested with .12 and .22 BB's) Over all is a great weapon for the cost and I hope I can get a bigger mag for it. Really good product overall.
4,Decent product,"Ordered this for my little brother for Christmas. He loved it instantly when he opened it. He is 11 years old, he loved all of the accessories it comes with too. He immediately took it outside to shoot. The only reason it looses a star from me is because it broke after just a few minutes of play, it stopped shooting far distances. Whatever was wron with it was easily fixed though, my husband had it working again in a matter of seconds."
5,advanced or not great gun,"i bought this gun for battles in the woods with my buddys and i works great pick off my friends for 50m away!!!!!!! this is a great gun for any one shoots hard, shoots fast,and best of all this is my most accurate gun i have and i own over 17!!!!! so all in all great gun, best machince gun i have if you want a machine gun buy this one"
4,Well M16-you get what you pay for,"I got this gun 2 months ago and it has been really great. I wouldn't take it to an professional airsoft war place because it just can't compete with the $200 guns they have. It has good range, although I have to use .20 grams because the hop-up is really good and they'll just go straight up. I was running and hit the tip on the ground and it broke off. No biggie- it looked flimsy anyway.Pro's:Durablegood rangeGood ROFGood FPSCons:mags not high capTip brokeOverview:Good mid level gunHAVE FUN!!!"
2,WHAT!?!?,"Okay I ordered this gun as a Well M16 RIS AEG what I got was a Double Eagle in it's packaging M83 yes there pretty much the same. But my question is, is there a difference??? Anyways this is a bad job on the posters. I think..."
1,m16 reveiw,The gun failed 3 weeks after receiving it. I have sent it back to Hot import toys almost 2 weeks ago and have not heard anything back. I am very dissatisfied with your product. I want another gun or my money back!!!!!Thank YouSteve
1,You don't know what magazine capacity is!? 13 year old kid from AZ,"Dude,or dudett, a clip is called a magazine, second capacity is how many bb's the clip or magazine holds. Don't get this gun, get the high power electric steyr, I shoots like 260 FPS with .12 grams, the mp5 sd3 and this gun only shoot about 200 FPS with .12, that's bad. The high power electric steyr is the same price, and a heck of a lot more powerful than this gun or the mp5 sd3."
1,Too Big!!,Don't waste your money on these oversized books! They are reprinted way too big to handle and read. I will not buy any more or these reprints!
3,"BERTRAND TAVERNIER, OPUS 1","*** 1974. Loosely based on Georges Simenon'sThe watchmaker of Everton, THE CLOCKMAKER was co-written and directed by Bertrand Tavernier. Earned the 1973 Louis Delluc Prize and two awards during the 1974 Berlin International Film Festival. The son of an ordinary French clockmaker commits murder. His father tries to understand why. Not bad but more a social study than an investigation movie. Hence, one can be annoyed by the numerous references to the French social climate of the early seventies."
4,Opportunity Lost .. flaws -a -plenty .,"The Band does no wrong . they were /are the best .My question is why put inferior live tracks on here .. when so much is missing? ..Aw Mercy , Plum Nellie (one of the most greasy distorted organ grooves of all time)Studio version of Red Beans And Rice ,Booker-Loo, One Mint Julep from the 'And Now' collection (this CD is very highly priced on Amazon should you want it for your collection).a couple more...Foxy Lady , Born Under A Bad Sign ,from Soul Limbo album , and 'The Beat Goes On' from 'Doin Our Thing' which is also fetching astronomical prices as I write this .. I am just scratching the surface here ..I look forward to the day when we get a really well thought out collection put together by someone who cares about the MUSIC .I was at The Stax -Volt Show in Manchester U.K. in 67' So I know this music quite well ."
4,The Background Soundtrack For Those From the Early 70's,"Of course Green Onions is here. It's a Greatest Hits boxed set after all. The title track is worth the price alone. Don't recognize the name? If not you'll know the tune for sure when you hear it. The Blues Brothers helped make it a comeback monster in their movie (why wouldn't they, half of their band is half of this band). You'll recognize plenty of the other tunes on this set even if they weren't all hits for these guys. As an extra treat the third disk contains live performances of some of these hits that are truly enjoyable even with the presence of Neil Young (not a big fan). To quote an advertisement slogan from about the same time as these songs, ""Try it, you'll like it""."
3,Love the color and fit,But the fabric left me itchy so most of the time I have to wear a tank underneath. It also started pilling after a wash. But the fit and style made it wearable.
3,nice price,"Nice, warm, inexpensive cashmere sweater. Very stylish. Size runs a little on the small side."
4,TRIBULATION Time Again!,"Even though The Crown Prince Of Reggae has stepped forward into The Promised Land this release is a strong reminder of the power of Dennis Brown's voice. The title cut ""Tribulation,"" is classic D-Brown with a crucial bass-line which makes yah body wanna move and groove to de riddim. ""Heartbreaking Girl,"" is on de ""flex riddim,"" so Lover's bettah be ready to get up and slow dance;""This Love Of Mine,"" is the D-Brown classic re-done inna fine fashion which makes you sing-a-long wid de Crown Prince who passed July 1, 1999. ""Love Keep Us Together,"" is a keeper you will play over and over; ""Make It Easy,"" is proof that Dennis' crooning style deserves maximum respect. TRIBULATION Time Again, no matter where you come from this to shall pass, but the legacy of Dennis Brown will live on through his music and I'm glad I purchased this CD!"
5,A fascinating look at the Zodiac from Christian perspective.,"This book is a complete surprise. Although the author spent many years researching the Zodiac, he points out very obvious facts that most people overlook. The book is easy to read as the author steps through each sign of the Zodiac and describes the original names of the stars and the symbols they represent as well as many Biblical references. The final conclusion is that the gospel is spelled out in the Zodiac. It starts with a Virgin with a baby and ends with a Lion destroying a serpent with many more analogies in between. A very thought provoking book."
5,Well written and researched.,William Banks has done an excellent work in writing this book. He avoids (often and wherever possible) the ramblings of confused myths and fables going straight to the heart of the issues. A Definite + for students of Biblical Astronomy and something any intermediate student of this subject should own.
1,Not a good learning tool,"This does not teach everyday situation vocabulary. It should have used some real life common situations so the learner could start using what they learned. It is based on making reservations at restarants, hotels,and a professional business office party meeting people. The places I go eat do not require reservations, I seldom need to stay at a hotel, and can't remember the last business party I was at if ever. It would be difficult for a new learner to figure out how to use the few words it teaches. I bought this to give to a new Spanish friend but it would be a waste of her time."
1,Overhyped and Misleading,"This product is useless except for learners who pre-possess a high degree of English proficiency. The situations presented are few and highly unlikely to be of any use in learning conversational English. Are you ready to make reservations over the phone? Do you have friends or a job that requires you to travel and meet business associates. If you answer yes, you don't need this. If you answer no, this will not help you."
5,Beautiful,"Beautiful, emotionally R&B; moving songs about the lives of Marines.Frank Wagner says God has inspired him to write Praise songs along with Patriotic songs.A rare musical talent.In God We Still Trust (was written to address the current war in Iraq, as we pray for our soldiers),Home is Where you Dig It (was written as a tribute to Vietnam soldiers who fought for our country. Every event mentioned in the song actually took place. The song was written by officer Terry Jones with assistance of The Singing Servant. Terry Jones served as a platoon leader with D Company, 1st Battalion, 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) from November 1967 to March 3, 1968. ""Home is Where You Dig It"" is factual and autobiographical)You Can't Kill Freedom (was written to address terrorism)Stand Up America (was written to address terrorism for 9/11)"
1,Warning:Fragile,"I purchased this pressure tank without seeing the tank in person, my mistake. The cover flange is hardened plastic and trying to screw a galvanized pipe into the plastic even with teflon tape seemed stupid but the company should know what its doing. Of course wanting it to be tight you screw it in tightly and place the tank where you need it and begin the plumbing process. 3-5 minutes into the job I hear a crack and sure enough the plastic is shot. Now I have no water system and the website says the replacement part is out of stock and it will be two weeks. Guess I'm not the only one having issues with this part. Don't think I can hold it that long. Hello gas station restroom. I would not buy this product again unless it was the only option or the take the plastic out and put in a more sturdy substance."
2,Milwaukee circular sawblade,"This saw blade is not the one in the large picture. It does not have the carbide teeth that the one in the picture does. If it were a Milwaukee metal cutting circular saw blade with carbide teeth it would be about three times the price of this saw blade. this saw blade may work OK for sheet metal but will wear out quickly if used for thicker metal. Also the burrs that are created when this saw blade is used for thicker metal are about 1/4"" long and very sharp and must be removed from the edge of the metal and will catch on the table of a table saw if this blade is used in a table saw."
3,Has the mettle for thin metal,"If you want to convert your circular saw to a metal cutting machine, you won't end up with the ideal tool for that purpose. But if it's an occasional need, give this blade a try. It does a good job of clean cuts on thin ferrous materials. I haven't tried it on anything truly heavy but so far it works as I might expect. You can also use it on metal framed items, but it's a compromise. You don't want to chew up a wood blade on a metal framed wooden item, nor would you want to continue cutting wood with this blade, but I've tried the more cautious approach of using both types with the depth set appropriately for each.When I first wrote this review, existing reviews were based on purchasing errors because this blade used to have the wrong picture associated with it. The picture is now correct and you should get the blade pictured, not the wood blade that was formerly pictured."
4,a pudding,"As my mother tongue isn't English, it is a bit difficult to read this book first. However,the situation starts getting better after the few pages. I enjoy reading this poem aloud just like playing words. I'd love to read this again during leisure time . The feeling of it is just like tasting a pudding slowly, unforgettable and reminds me lots of fairy tales and fables."
2,Just OK,"I had heard the song Tree Fallen on Pandora and thought I would purchase this CD for my wife. After listening, Tree Fallen was really the only good song on this CD. Most of the songs are repetitive."
4,Good athletic tape,"This is a much nicer tape than standard athletic tape that you can buy in your local sports store since it is porous and breathable. My only issue is that my doctor had the tan version, but I've been unable to find that online. It sticks really well, so I would recommend a pre-taping spray to ease removal."
3,Not bad,"There isn't much to say about this book other than it was a worthwhile read for a Diablo fan. The story wasn't really all that impressive, but it was good enough to get me through a long plane trip. Worth the money spent and the time to read it, but i won't be reading it again any time soon."
4,Love the Diablo series...,"...so I might be biased. This was another cool book, though not my favorite. Still, very worth reading if you're interested in the Diablo world."
4,One of the best,"I have my copy (9th edition) open next to me as I write this review. I used it as an MBA student at the University of Tennessee, seen the new edition in the bookstore and still use it as a reference today. The book continues to reflect the breadth and depth of knowledge the author has for corporate finance.I have one qualm: revisions should have an emphasis on the latest in their field (unless you have a book on dead English poets! ). Where this book is unshakeable in relaying the fundamentals to the students of finance, it could possible use more information on areas like EVA, CCV, derivatives, etc. But then again, this book is about fundamentals, right? Regardless, a great book."
2,Slovakia - Heart of Europe,It is ok for a child's book. For $31 I did not expect a child's book with approx 60 pages. I thought it would be a regular adult book with 300 or so pages
2,this is not doin' it again!,"When I bought this product, I thought it was a CD ofconcert footage. It has maybe 2-3 partial songs from the concert, but it's mainly interviews. I was fortunate enough to see them this year and I really wanted a concert CD."
1,Beach Boys,"That is a group that should retire NOW....they are done..i just cringe when i see them ""perform"" on television....very painful to watch.if you buy anything by the Beach Boys new? forget it...buy the ""old stuff"" , better performance."
1,Beach Boys Rip Off,If you enjoy a bunch of old guys sitting around talking for an hour this is the video for you. Basically this should be the bonus material on a full length DVD. You get very little live music from the tour. Not sure why they choice not to document the full concert? Instead they appear to just want to rip off their fans. Not a good buy!
1,Concert Video Please,"I will not buy this video. The Beach Boys recently played a full tour that included over two hours and almost every significant song. No reason at all why that concert, which was wonderful incidentally, shouldn't be released right now!"
5,Doing it again,Great DVD highly recommend Love it great remembering the show and the great wonderful Beach Boys. Fabulous good vibrations special
1,Unusable!,"Don't buy this thing... When you pull a shelf out, it's almost impossible to get it back in. What a bummer! I finally put it out on the street."
2,Disappointing,"I'm obviously in the minority, but I didn't find this book very helpful. The approach described in the book may be well suited for people just beginning their careers or entering/re-entering the workforce mid-life. However, I don't think that the advice in the book is really geared toward the person who is established in a career and seeking advice on how to realistically make a change. I wish I had not spent my money; there are definitely more helpful books out there."
5,Very nice indeed,I didn't expect this high quality for such a low price. I picked up a cordless Makita and use this for more precise cutting with less ripout and it does the job extremely well. I ordered two more just in case all of you buy out the rest of the stock!
2,Colloquial german,"I found this book interesting , but limited. The colloquialisms were not adequately localised to regions, which is important and were somewhat dated."
3,Cute for a sports themed Snoopy nursery,"The mobile is cute, but the wind up is a pain. It lasts a few minutes and it is noisy especially when a baby is trying to go to sleep. The Snoopy, football, basketball and soccer ball all seem to be well made, but the Snoopy is heavier and seems to hang lower. I was able to pull the string up and tie a knot. Our nursery is Snoopy themed, so it worked for what we needed. Being a new mom, I would not purchase a wind up mobile. Spend the extra money and get one that you can either plug in or runs off of batteries."
2,ok,"Got this to match the bedding set, but am not impressed with the mobile itself. The music box sounds like it is decades old, and the attachment piece to the crib needed to be modified to fit on my crib. Cheap construction"
5,Superb Figure,"This is an excellent sculpt of Thor in one of his armored periods, the joints are good, with none of them being loose out of the package. The figure makes an excellent addition to my Marel collection."
2,Unexpectedly disappointing,"I went through college with Nat Gonella's music, which was consistently well up in the charts and MELODY MAKER polls. This CD contains none of the jazz numbers that made his recordings so good. His trumpet playing is tepid generally throughout and the famous trumpet duets that he played with brother 'Bruts' are notably absent. Nat was a standout trumpet player but this was sadly lacking in this CD. For the price, I cannot honsetly say that it is a waste of money (it's a 2-CD set), but I doubt if it will ever be played again in my foreseeable future!"
4,Replacement,"I always liked this series and after losing the books in a move, I felt the need to replace them."
2,A little to child like for me,"First off you can get the whole story of the 5 books from the prophecy on the first page. I didnt want to believe it would be so predictable while reading it but lo and behold no suprises here.The driving force from this book is the characters i must admit they were great and there interactions brilliant, warm and very funny. My two stars go to them i wish i could read about them in a story that doesnt involve the systematic travel to every part of the world following a mandatory killing of a big evil baddie after which all women and men marry each other and live happily ever after.read if your focus is on loveable characters rather then fresh, unpredictable plots"
2,You can skip to the end...,"If you take my advice, you will flip the pages and just start reading whenever you see ""Polgara,"" ""CeNedra,"" ""Garion,"" or ""Bel-anything."" That way, you can finish the book in about a half hour or so, and you will save yourself some of the most tedious war descriptions ever put on paper. After all, the whole war thing is just a diversionary tactic so that Garion can fight the ""dreadful"" god Torak (so dreadful that he quakes in his sandals when Pol turns him down for a date. Sheesh.)If there is no real point to the war scenes, then all that is left of the plotline is the final showdown, which has such a predictable outcome that there isn't any point to that, either. About the only thing you can say for the Eddings team is that at least they got the thing finished. It probably should have stayed in that bottom desk drawer."
4,The End of a Great Beginning,"The Belgariad, and specifically these last two instalments of the series are the end of a great beginning to the fantasy of David and Leigh Eddings. Garion's quest reaches it's climax and all the pieces of the prophecy come together like a well woven tapestry. The story may be conventional. It follows the quest archetype very well. However the characters are fantastically developed. The Eddings make them real, and that makes it easy to be more concerned about what happens to them. The writing is excellent in my opinion, and the plot is tightly woven. I will say however that Eddings seems to improve every time he goes back to a set of characters, and I highly recomend the Mallorean after you finish the Belgariad. In my oppinion Eddings just keeps getting better."
5,The Belgariad,The books were in excellent condition. David Eddings's story of Belgarion keeps the reader enchanted throughout the series.
1,Why Volume 2 and not 1 as well?,"I love this series totally and want to read it again with my kindle, but volume one isn't available ??? why is this? The book itself is 5 stars but I'm not happy at all that the volume one is not available .. why get 2 when one can't be bought?"
4,The Endchancers review from James,in book five Ce'Nedra and Aunt Polgara have the army together and they are going to fight the people of Torak the evil god (the child of dark). While they are doing that Belgaraion (the child of light)and belgarath went to the iron tower so that Belgaraion and Torak can fight to the death. before the fight Durnik the blacksmith dies and Polgara go berserk on the will that Torak is useing to get her to be his bride.

3,Good Teen Novel,"Read these books time and again growing up, recently decided to read again after probably 15 years. Still enjoyed from a nostalgic point of view, but as an adult these are just children books."
5,David Eddings,David Eddings has definitely earned his name in writing. I have read many of his books and I don't plan on stopping until I have read them all. I strongly recommend reading his books if you are a fantasy lover.
5,Apologies & corrections from the Author,"Hello to readers.My face is red. In my last note, I mentioned an upcoming fantasy novel that will be published by Ace in February 2000. Sorry to say I got the titles mixed up and out of order. The trilogy is called THE SWORD, THE RING, AND THE CHALICE. The first book out will be entitled THE SWORD. Again, my apologies to everyone for the mixup. Let's blame it on the fact that I'm busy writing at present and getting absent-minded as well. Also, for those of you who really loved the Ampris adventures, you might want to check out some of my older sf titles, written under the pseudonym Sean Dalton. Happy reading!"
2,Far below my expectations of LucasArts,"I picked this up almost as soon as it was published...and wished that I hadn't. The character development is weak and the dialog is very poorly written. The last quarter of the book is okay, but hardly good enough to warrant the purchase price. Skip it."
3,Fell a little short,"This book started out great, but after about 250 pages, it's as if the author suddenly realized it's time to wrap things up. Nothing significant even began to happen until there were about 100 pages left, and then it happened too quickly to be convincing. Some of the characters were underdeveloped or just plain unnecessary, as were some of the sub-plots. Overall, this series is definitely worth reading, but I can't help thinking that, after a LOOOOOONG wait for this final chapter, it fell short."
5,I Loved the books!!!,I love the books!!!! I read book one and book two and I couldn't wait till book three came out!!! Iam really excited!!! Can't wait to read this one!!!
4,Works,Decent Quality muffler at a low price. Everything looked and fit as described and went together quickly. Would Recommend to others and would buy again.
5,Essential Rose-Marie,"For breadth of your collection, Rose-Marie's three cd set is the best choice. But if you have the cash to buy two of her albums, this one is a close second...her rendition of ""I'll Fall to Pieces"" gives you chills, it's that good."
2,Not nearly as good as classic stratego,"My son has been asking for the original game having played it at friends houses and wants to get rid of this version. There's many flaws here compared to the original game...1 There's only 20 pieces per side but the 2 player board is the same size, leading to a lot of awkward open space2 The pieces are very hard to see from any angle but straight behind them, meaning you have to elevate the board to play the game3 The cards fall out of the slots in the pieces- we have lost a few and are frequently having to reassemble piecesAs I'm now being forced to go back and buy the original game, I figured I'd post this review as a warning to others."
2,NOT THE REAL STRATEGO,"When I first found this item on Amazon.com, I was ecstatic. Four-Player Stratego was a dream. I opened the box and found out that the pieces, rules, and board are all different from the original Stratego. This game is nothing like Stratego so stay away."
5,Excellent place to start,"Although I only have about 12 of Red's CD's, the low number is not from a lack of desire. This CD is a fantastic compilation of some of Red's groovier tunes. It is set on the backdrop of some impressive sidemen. This is a great place to start of those unfamiliar with Red Garland. Trust me, you'll soon have all of the CD's from which these tracks were taken and then some!!"
4,"Excellent series, slightly marred.","Overall this is a great series.Unfortunately it is somewhat ruined by having Jon Steward instead of Hal Jordan.Hal Jordan is one of the flagship DC characters - he is Green Lantern - yet he is given short shift.Jon Stewart is a minor character on the level of say, Gnort, yet he persists in bossing his betters around. Furthermore he interferes in the relationship between Hawman and Hawkwoman and treats Vixen terribly. In fact he is completely out of character with his comic book version.Before the end of the series I was praying that he would be killed by Lobo, which unfortunately does not happen.Why he is even in the series, other than in a minor cameo, is a mystery.Other than this annoying set back the series is fairly true to the comics and well worth it."
3,"Not on Blu Ray, why?!!","My subject line says it all. Like I'm really going to fumble with 15 discs. WB could easily release this on a 4-6 disc blu ray set. Once again, Warner forces me to wait on a series I'd otherwise would purchase. If you're a Blu ray fan, hold out."
5,SUPERB SERIES,"THE BOX SET SAYS IT CONTAINS 91 EPISODES. IT'S ACTUALLY LESS THAN THAT. IT'S 64 EPISODES. FEW OF THESE EPISODES ARE 3 PARTERS. OTHERS ARE 2 PARTERS. I COUNTED ALL THE SHOWS. IF 1 EPISODE IS A 2 OR 3 PARTER, U HAVE 2 SAY THAT ALL 2 OR 3 PART EPISODES IS ALL 1 EPISODE. U CAN'T ASSUME THAT PART 2 AND 3 OF THE SAME EPISODE IS ANOTHER EPISODE. IT'S A CONTINUATION OF THE SAME EPISODE. THAT'S WHY THIS SERIES HAS 64 EPISODES, NOT 91."
2,justice league,Bought this for my granddaughter who wants to see super hero women! too bad it wouldnt play!! not worth the return cost.
1,treating superman & batman like garbage one episode at a time,this series can not possible get any worse then it all ready is. they should never and i do stress never i boy do i stress never should have put batman or superman in this pathic series. They should have just put the five of the others dc comics chracators in this show if they had done that then this series would have been much better. trust me stick with the batman and superman animated series at least those shows do justice to the two most beloved charactors in the dc universe.
4,Fantastic series But tin it came in gave truble,"The series as a whole is fantastic and the issues with the box art for vol one and two that others have pointed out seem to have been fixed at some point.But the problem I did have with the packaging was the metal tin that the cases came in. It may have been damaged during shipping but I had to pry it open, thus ruining it, in order to get the cases containing the DVDs out. The art on it is great but something made it just about impossible to get the cases out.Otherwise it is a great series at a great price.*edit* Getting to the last disk of the first season of JLU shows that the episodes on that disk are out of order. Not just single story episodes either but rather episodes that deal with the over all season. Can be avoided if you watch the episodes from the episode menu but still annoying when you want to watch the entire disk of episodes."
2,Great show badly packaged,"The discs do not follow the storyline and Volume 2 is actually the first incarnation and Volume 1 is the second.The animation is great and the stories solid. Individually, each is great. The packaging leaves much to be desired, thus only 2 stars."
2,hidden agenda,This book is just OK. The writter seems to have an agenda and trys to get you to draw conlusions from some of the parables that aren't there. The idea should be to bring out what is in the parable not smash you own idea into the text. If in the end you understand the parable different than the original audience you probably have missed the author's intent.
3,Usual textbook,"Very detailed, rather boring at times, but that's probably due to the topic. Explanations of detailed concepts are a little brief and kind of fly through. Covers a lot of material well."
2,Not worth it,First of all this book is too academic and second everything that is there in this book can be found online. The content is definitely not worth the cost. I bought this book only because my course adviser made is compulsory.
1,This item is not as described.,"I purchased this for my son's birthday because he want a camoflage toy gun. The description said the gun took ""rolled caps."" I bought those for it. The gun came with no instructions, and the caps were impossible to shoot with it unless one person held the cap in the exact position while another pulled the trigger. I would not have been so disappointed had I paid maybe $10 for this, but for the price I expected more."
4,Wierdly funny and gratifying,"Reading Eduardo Mendoza must be a whole experience in english. I have done it in spanish and he is simply one of the best writters in Spain. Not only for his deep knowledge of the ""catalan"" very particular way of being, but for his amazing talent to make people laugh trough a really well done literature. This particular book makes you share a crazy adventure, an impossible story that the reader ends up believing in it. This is the very first case of a derange patience who will leave his mental illness hospital to solve a mistery. And once is started the story, the reader wont have the strength to stop the book. Only laughing tears may do the miracle to close the book for an instant. A must yet not his best book."
4,Probably best for fans of short stories,"This book has a bunch of short stories. It has a lot of nice graphic art samples in it that that instructional design person in me howls over because they don't relate to the story. There is a bathroom thing with flow chart. I liked a number of the stories I read in it and I've read about 2/3 of the book. I just can't read short story collections the same way that I read fiction. It is something that I've been picking up though, rather regularly, to read the stories. The book has just enough height on it that it won't sit the spine out on my book shelf."
1,Not Sir Thomas,"Just chiming in to say that this is definitely not the Beecham performance. I own the Beecham on a set of Melodram LPs out of Italy, and just listening to the opening bars would convince anyone that these are different performances. And, of course, there is no mistaking Welitsch's distinctive voice. The LPs, by the way, all things considered, are quite decent sounding and without significant technical lapses."
1,The Wrong Performance Indeed,"Not only is the gentleman from Pensacola correct, but if one listens to the sound clips given here by Opera D'Oro, they are unquestionably from the 1957 performance. There is no mistaking Inge Borkh's voice, and the whiny Aegisth of the vocally washed-out Max Lorenz sounds nothing like the magnificent Wagnerian tenor Walter Widdop."
3,A bit noisy,"I love the extra heat, particularly first thing in the morning; it really warms the place up. But the blower is noisy and cycles on and off all night. I'm using it in a one room cabin so there's no getting away from it."
1,Worst sound system I have ever heard!,"This sound system is just junk. Two little dinky speakers and that's it. This is not an item you shold be interested in. If you want to feel the walls shake get a sub and some satellite speakers and hook those puppies up. Now that's power. If you want to hear an anoying pew pew sound than buy this. I sure don't.A concered reveiwer,Jordan SnitzlerCalgary Herald"
1,BLAH!,"Nope, you dont want these. Why?, you ask....1. The Magnets in the speakers + the processor chip in your PS2 = Bad Mojo.2. Speakers Generate heat, PS2 Generates Heat add those two together and you have a overheated PS2.Now it would be better if the speakers werent so close to your PS2 but they are as close to it as they can get.You may not exp. problems right away, but you will."
5,the best game ever,when i bought this sound system i thought it was going to be dumb. but afterusing it a couple of time s it got great i give tgis five stars because it is the best playstation 2 machine there is also it really does make your game surround sound it makes i tso the sound is in front and back and sise to side that is why i gave it 5 srtars because it is the best play statrion 2 thing there is the end
5,good regency part of a series,"i enjoy regency novels by patricia veryan, all her series romances are gopod the all belong together."
1,Poor quality and support,"I purchased this power washer approx. 18 months ago, have used it less than 30 hours total and maintain it perfectly. It is used just for home use. I just noticed a leak between the pump body and the head. Upon inspection I noticed water had even leaked into the pump body contaminating the pump oil!! I drained everything, got to looking at my parts diagram and disassembled the head from the pump body. The diagram lists a simple 3 O-ring and gasket kit that turns out they want $150 for!!!!!! You have got to be kidding me! I submitted a request through the Generac e-support site and was told 'ya that sounds right'.The Honda engine is tops, but a power washer is kinda useless when the pump is a piece of junk, and you are taken for a ride when you do have problems."
4,Identity,"Visually this book is great - however it is only meant to be visual resource as it only contains samples of peoples work. Each company used as examples of good identity programs in this book show visually what they each had come up with and also names the designers and client and gives a breif review of each company's choice of design/text/logo for their identity programs. The book is great for giving visual ideas - but lacks any real text about what identity is, how it can be successfully implemented in order to give it a good place on the market etc."
5,A Great Lesson in Taking Chances in Music !,"I love Tal , He isnt Very well Known , Because He took a Break in the 60s , But His music is Different then most , He like everyone else of His time came from Charlie , But He took it to another place , I had a chance to see Tal play and Met him , it was a Wonderful Time , The Book on Tals Playing is Also a Great Learning Tool as is the Hot Licks Video , if You Dont Have These , Shame On You !"
5,Tal cooks on all burners,"If you haven't heard this guy, do yourself a favor, get this disc. It is real good listening, unique, he is really like no other - a must for any fan of guitar. Well done, a real nice addition to the library."
3,This is not bad for the money,"I purschased this Phillips cdrw about 2 months ago. It was very easy to install. I have used it almost daily to burn music off the web.It is very easy to use the download time is quick (I have Cable),and this cdrw can handle it.I had bought a diffrent brand about 8 months ago was not even able to install it .I threw 80 bucks down the drain. You have to read the install instructions before you buy them,or you will be lost.Phillips makes it easy.This is a good and reliable Product."
4,Simply Slang carries on the Illinois tradition of power pop,"I don't why it is, but Illinois seems to be the breeding ground for power-pop bands. First it was Cheap Trick, then Enuff Z'Nuff, and now its Simply Slang. I first heard of them from my roommate who constantly played ""Angeline"" over and over and over again for a whole month! Well, after a while, I was hooked too. Simply Slang has great songs and a very cool style. Forget the trendy stuff on the radio. This EP will remind you of Cheap Trick's classic debut-very rough and straight ahead. My only complaint is that it's only four songs. Nonetheless, I gave it four stars-One star for each track. A strong debut from a great new band."
3,Good old fashioned working class rock-n-roll,"These guys are great-You gotta love a band that borrows from George Thoroughgood, Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Bon Jovi and mixes it all together, with great results. Live 4 the Weekend is an anthem of the ages! The sound on this cd is very clean and realistic, not over-produced like most of the crap that passes for rock these days. The singer sounds like Alice Cooper meets Mick Jagger, while the band plays in a 80's Kiss style (minus the keyboards). The cd is worth the moola, if you can get it for less than the ridiculous $8.99 Amazon wants for it here. I paid five bucks for it at a local mom and pop shop here in Providence."
3,"Engaging, addictive stories that are always bizarre.","These short stories are gripping, I could hardly put the book down. They are nonsensical, but in a perfectly reasonable way, life is very odd, and in this way Murakami's work is reflective of our times. If you read Wind Up Bird Chronicle, and not this, then don't be surprised that the first short story is pretty much the first chapter of that novel."
3,Good but not the best,I have read a good deal of Murakami now and this was not his best. however while reading it i realized that how the translation is done makes a huge difference. this book has a different translator for each story. for novice Murakami readers i reccomend Kafka on The Shore and The Wind up bird chronicles.
2,The Elephant Vanishes,This is a very unusual book. I can't say It was one of the best books I read but once I started a short story I couldn't put it down.
4,Good,"Unlike most anthologies of short stories, those by Haruki Murakami are generally very interesting. None of the stories in this collection seemed like filler, chosen just to make sure that there were enough stories to fill a book.Instead, I reached the end, and felt a bit sad that the ride was over already. Other reviewers will have, I am sure, talked about what the stories are, so I won't bother.I will just say that you should not expect a normal story arc in any of them. Some have it, but if you expect it going in, you will only be disappointed. Instead, take Murakami by the hand and let him be your guide into his head and his worlds. And simply enjoy the ride.Buy it, read it, lend it, keep it. It is a good book.Harkius"
3,A Fluke?,"Perhaps it is because this is a compilation of earlier works, or perhaps because the scope of short stories is limiting, I found myself a little disappointed with this book. While I am without a doubt a Murakami fan (I absolutely loved A Wild Sheep Chase; Dance, Dance, Dance; Hardboiled Wonderland; and Kafka on the Shore), I found the stories here lacked the complexity that I have come to enjoy from Murakami. I did enjoy some of the stories here, but, over all, I found the book a little lacking in depth."
3,Not too bad,"This is a good collection of short stories, I love the writing style of Haruki Murakami. Especially enjoyed the short story ""The Kangaroo Communiques"", a joy to read. Some of the short stories felt too short though, so now I am reading Kafka on the Shore, another really really good novel."
3,Thought provoking and somewhat surreal,"Some of the short stories in this book are insightful, while others are surreal. These stories touch on themes involving relationships, fate, and our own self-image. Give that these stories are translated from Japanese, it is interesting to see how familiar the characters and the settings feel. Is this a reflection of the homogenization of cultures, or is it a reminder that we really are more similar than our cultural differences suggest? These stories have many layers of meaning that can be used for analysis."
2,Don't bother. Pointless stories and unlikable characters,"If you get a chance to read this, don't. I listened to the audio version of the book and had to force myself to finish it because it was a selection of my book club. I kept hoping there might be some thread cleverly connecting the stories, but except for the character of Noboru Watanabe, who showed up in different guises in a few stories, that thread never materialized. Many of the stories seemed like so much navel-gazing, letting us in on the private thoughts of unremarkable people. While I, too, might have thoughts such as ""Do bugs get cold?"" I hardly consider them the stuff of literature. It's not that the quality of the writing itself was bad. Rather, the stories were boring and pointless."
3,wow..,There were so many stories that I simply couldn't bring myself to read every single one. But I've read most of them and my favorite story is the one with the boy and the girl 100% perfect for each other.
4,John McClain before LOOPER,I just like anything with Bruce Willis. This is good but i do like other films by him better so I would give this a three & a half!
5,Amazing concept...,"While this movie was amazing, I can't help but think I've seen a movie with this idea before. I just can't remember what it was. However, after watching this movie I can't help but think that society as a whole today is almost living like this to a certain extent in their online lives. Especially those that can't tear themselves away from online video games and ""avatar""-based chat programs.If technology this advanced ever becomes available, I can imagine most of society embracing it unfortunately."
3,Worth Watching,"A good story line that doesn't go the distance, and the ending is somewhat predictible. But it is entertaining. At the risk of seeming shallow, I say that had they added some skin it would have improved the movie."
3,where's the beef?,"It's not easy to be kind to this movie when the best thing about it is the wig Bruce Willis wears in the pic. I gave it 3 stars and that may be stretching the point. I did not feel the movie was good and on the other hand I did not feel the movie was bad. I want to be drawn into a movie, invest emotions, good or bad. Not this pic never happened."
3,"Entertaining, but short","The concept behind this film had a lot of potential, but wasn't as fleshed out as it should have been. I enjoyed the film and found it entertaining (mostly because of Bruce Willis), but it was short.It was a hoot seeing Ving Rhames in a character you'd never expect to see him in.Good for a rainy afternoon viewing."
3,"""Been done before"" sci-fi flick","If you take bits of ""Minority Report,"" ""The Island,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""I, Robot,"" and add some ol' ""Die Hard"" Bruce Willis to the film, you get ""Surrogates.""Only 1.5 hours long but not enough story to get you really involved. Def. worth seeing at least once if you're a fan of the genre, but def. not a keeper."
2,pretty cool concept but lame action movie,have to admit the concept was kinda cool but it was a very lame action movie hardly any action in it there were things that didnt make sense like if your using a robot and the other person is using a robot how does that solve anything like wars if someone gets hit u just plug in a new robot or robots having sex with robots how does that do anything for anyoneanyway save yourself the time and skip this movie
4,An Awesome Action Film!!!,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. The film takes place in 2017, and everybody uses a remotely-controlled androids called surrogates. Bruce Willis stars as an FBI agent named Tom Greer. Tom is investigating the murder of two people who died when their surrogates were destroyed. How could this happen, and who is doing it? I highly recommend SURROGATES!!!"
3,Average sci-fier,this is a pretty average sci-fier. Good special effects and of course Bruce Willis is always fun to watch. He will try any kind of movie.
1,Very dissapointing,Worst Bruce Willis movie that I've ever seen. Very dissapointing. I do not recommend spending money on this movie. .
2,Didn't like it.,"I really enjoy Bruce Willis, and watch all his movies. This one I didn't like. The story matter just didn't appeal, although Mr. Willis does his usual to make the film fly. I just can't get myself to recommend it to anyone, unless you get it for free."
3,Worn out plot,"OK, but seen too many with too little real plot like this one and would like something with a new plot"
1,Waste of time and money,I like Bruce Willis action movies. I watched this movie because he was in it. Bad decision though... watching it was a total waste of time and money.
1,No!,This is NO doubt one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. Nothing against the cast its just Terrible!
1,Insulting and waste of valuable time,"I think action stars like Mr. Bruce, Mr. Rocky, Mr. Arnold have to know when to say enough. I watch about 30 mins of this boring and flat bad dialog of a movie. In one scene Mr Bruce is this 30 something super robot jumping over great distances and next he is this 60 something old man who can hardly walk into a crowd without scaring himself. Next you have have Mr Ving as the savior of the world < Sorry I only know one savior he is not it. One scene in the movie a found very insulting & offensive was someone tied or nailed to a cross. At that I turned off/deleted it from My DVR list. There must be a 1001 other movies that are for rental or viewing on TV and I am always amazed at what some consider entertainment. I give this movie a 1 star rating and I am being kind when I do this. I would also recommend it as non buy sooner or later it will be at your local discount store for couple of dollars"
3,"Nice video, audio and extras.. but the movie is lacking.","Picked this up after being interested by the trailer - looked like a fun movie that just got undeserved criticism.I have to agree with the others though - the movie was entertaining, but not as much as it could be. The idea wasn't unique and didn't really draw you in to the movie. The movie ran just under 90 minutes and left me with the feeling that this was a cut-down version of it (a 2-hour version might have worked better).The video and audio were very good (especially considering it's a recent release with a bigger budget), the extras were decent (a couple features and a commentary) but not great. It's a nice demo disc, but not something you'd want to watch more than a couple times.Movie: * * * (out of 5)Video: * * * * (out of 5)Audio: * * * * (out of 5)Extras * * * (out of 5)Overall: * * * (out of 5)"
3,It's Decent,"I didn't have a problem with the movie; though it's something I would expect more from Lionsgate versus Touchstone. It's sci-fi, has a little bit of action, somewhat thought provoking, Matrix meets iRobot, and has a less than memorable script. The character development isn't important enough to really harp on the acting and the story is somewhat predictable. It's a middle-of-the-road movie. If you enjoy low budget Lionsgate B movies, you'll like this Touchstone movie."
3,INTERESTING BUT NOT INDELIBLE,"Based on a popular graphic novel. There's an interesting focus on a worldwide culture that uses mannequin versions of themselves to function in the outside world while they stay home linked up to a virtual reality machine. Their surrogates, as they are known, always look better than their real selves. Real surprise there. The story was rushed in Act 3 when there should have been more meat. Even though there were some big names in it it didn't measure up to greatness yet it was somewhat likable. Sci Fi types will appreciate it more. MY GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: August."
4,Surrogates I different,This movie is pretty good. It is different think that people would be so lazy and scared to come out of their house at they would use a robot that looked like them. The really bad part is they would hold jobs like police or beautition. Amagine walking you robot to a beauty parlor to get its hair done will you lay in bed being a bum.
4,A New Twist and Refreshing,"This film puts a new twist on the standard robot movies. Somewhere between I Robot and the Stepford Wives. I found it very interesting in premise and filled with good performances through out. It's not one of the dazzling special effects laden thrill ride so many movies are today, it doesn't try to be or need to be. Perhaps because it tells a story and has a plot, it doesn't need to rely on an overload of special effects to hold the audiance. While I have some minor criticisms of the storyline, overall it was well written and Willis gives a strong performance as an ""everyman"" trapped in a world where he doesn't necessarily fit in. So if you're looking for a good thought provoking movie, I think you'll enjoy this. If you're looking for flashy non stop special effects, you might want to look elsewhere. Four stars. Good job."
2,made for TV?,"The movie had an interesting concept but was poorly executed. Fans of Bruce Willis' action flicks won't find that here. There is no mystery or suspense. The whole movie falls flat. Disappointment from beginning to end, but watchable, thus the second star."
3,Better than Expected,"This director made T3. It was suck. He also made U-571. It was good. Now, Surrogates, it is very good. I like this kind of movei, and am satisfied with this si-fi plot. OK, some says that there is no originality. But I could enjoy it. Good enough.I found Rosamund Pike is amazing."
4,Good,I don't think I have ever seen a Bruce Willis movie that wasn't good. He's wonderful....the idea was futuristic and good....not quite as exciting as his Die Hard movies but excellent.
3,WHERE THERE'S A WILLIS,"It's to Bruce Willis' credit that this movie ultimately entertains. Also it's economic 88 minutes running time keeps things moving. The scary premise of living life through surrogacy is well defined and the ending creepy. Bruce plays the world weary cop as well as you'd expect, but Radha Mitchell, James Cromwell and Ving Rames are kinda wasted. I still found it an entertaining diversion."
3,Mildly entertaining,"An okay sci-fi thriller. Filmed in my back yard (almost literally)it has some good action and FX. Concept is fine, but overall it feels a little sloppy and underdeveloped. Diverting for a bit, but there is something about it that just felt cheap and lazy."
2,you can do better than that Bruce,This is not acceptable as a classic Bruce film. I am totally disappointed. The plot was all over the place. no favorite main character to hang your hat on. It was a sloppy job. Hated it!!
3,Intriguing plot but the execution is lukewarm,"It could have been a gripping thriller! The plot is original and interesting to me. In the movie, anybody could create a handsome and rich replicant of himself in the on-line world. The replicants can interact with each other like dating, etc. The original idea to me is that one day, a killer started killing the owners of these clones via the rerplicants themselves! However, the directing and the action are just average.It's worth watching once."
3,Tedious at times,"Some slapstick comedy as the Nazis prepare to conquer France in 1940? Yep, but it's all a bit forced, with the usual litany of madcap mistaken motivations. It's clouded by some nonsense about a scientist who has discovered ""heavy water"" which could be made into atomic bombs if the Nazis get it. The several romances here lack heat. It's fun to imagine that Bordeaux was like this before the war, though. I had to pause this many times over several days to get through it."
4,Bon Voyage,"J'aime bien le film ""Bon Voyage"". Les acteurs et le metteur en scene ont tres bien. J'aime bien l'intrigue. Je vous recommend ""Bon Voyage"" a tous personnes parce qu'il est tres bon."
5,entertaining movie,this is one of the best movies i've seen so far this year. i hope ebert & roeper don't forget about it. has some of the best cinematography i've seen in a movie in a while. this is a really funny well-made movie.
5,enjoyed it,i was pleasantly surprised when i saw this film. it's a world war 2 comedy\drama in french that really entertains its audience. one of the better films i've seen so far this year. i hope ebert & roeper don't forget it.
4,Very Entertaining!,This was such a fun and hilarious movie. It's a bit fast paced and keeps you watching so you don't get too confused with the lives of all the people while they intertwine.
5,"An irreplacable shining star Kevyn Aucoin, He will be missed","This book incapsulates a genius and his gift of insight and ability to create such mind blowing beauty. The book tell of his childhood and goes through a multitude of experience that shaped his life and nurtured his personal creativity. It also shows a number of his clients and people he has worked with and they offer comments and goodbyes to Aucoin, who has died recently. It is well rounded and very hard to put down. I have all of the books related to him and recommend them all to anyone who is in advertising, fashion, beauty, and commercial art industry. His story is one of struggles and accomplishments. It is tragic that we lost this brilliant, intelligent, inspiring individual, it is evident that he was just getting started."
2,STATE OF GRACE feel to it,STATE OF GRACE feel to an Irish mob type of thing on the west side of ny. ends kind of too cliche-ish. good writer though. hopefully the next one will be a little more original
1,I wish I could speed this CD up.,"I have all the ""remembering the fifties"" series recordings produced by Jack Jezzero and Sam Levine, and they are great. This is the only one of the series that was not produced by Jack & Sam and it is a hugh disappointment. The music on this disc sounds to me as though it has been intentionally slowed down, like a 45rpm record being played at 33 rpm. I bought this CD after owning the other albums in the ""remembering the fifties"" series, expecting the same high quality as Lovin' in the Fifties, Rocking in the Fifties and Moonlight in the Fifties. In my opinion this album is not near the equal of the Jezzro & Levine productions. If you are a fan of the fifties era rock music, than I recommend all the albums in the ""remembering the fifties"" series on Green Hill except this one."
3,Old Translations,"This book collects old tanslations. E.g., Chamisso's ""...Schlemihl"" is in a 19th-century translation by Henry Morley. A more recent trans. is Harry Steinhauer's 1977 version in German Romantic Stories (Continuum, ed. Ryder). Stifter's 'Brigitta' is in Edward Fitzgerald's 1957 trans. (cf. Helen Watanabe-O'Kelly's 1990 trans.), Storm's 'Immensee' is C. W. Bell's trans."
1,Unseen,I received a defective DVD that only repeated the introduction nonstop.I returned it and requested a replacement (in writing) but received a refund instead.
5,LOVE IT!!,Absolutely love this model. One of the most outstanding breyers in my collection. Totally worth asking for.
5,We are NOT...,"writing reviews about the Spirit and Family Classics Set from Breyer. However, we ARE writing reviews about Breyer's Traditional Spirit.When, and if, you get this Spirit, make sure you get, or have, Breyer's Traditional Rain from the movie. They make a lovely couple, I'm sure, even though I don't have either."
5,Funny and true!,I have had this book since it was first published. And it is funny and hits home. I just love it. Marlyn Schwartz knows what it means to be Southern.
5,Pleased Southerner,Received product in excellent condition and in exact time as quoted. I would highly recommend! Great sale.
3,While it is a good book...,"I was a bit disappointed overal in this book. While some things did have me chuckling to myself (knowing I did this) a lot of it had no relevance to main-stream Southern ways. Maybe I didn't get the concept. The book did not have as much ""substance"" as I had hoped. For instance, I don't care much about debutantes or beauty pagents or the ""Junior League"". (I had never even heard of the Junior League until I read it listed in an obituary in my local newspaper!) There is plenty more to include about the South than who's in what pagent. Bottom line, this book is humerous, but it takes a lot more to be a Southern belle than what Maryln includes in this book."
1,"Worst ""book"" I've ever read","Unless you like laughing at other people's lack of intelligence and compassion, this book is not for you. It's absolutely ridiculous how these women act. I don't think they understand what elegance and decorum is about... Much like a person who follows a rule without understanding its purpose."
5,my life . . .,"I hate to admit to it, but this book chronicles my REAL yet LIBERAL life- ahh, yes- you can still lean left yet lead the life of the ridiculous :) (I say that with great affection) I voted for Obama in 2008, but can't get away from my South(ern) Texas roots- I was a Kappa Kappa Gamma; was presented in the Tyler Rose Festival; bowed as a debutante; and donned a crown as a duchess in Fiesta- (whatever to the ladies in Charleston)- My silver pattern is Francis I, crystal is Lismore and I am damn proud of it- wonderfully humorous book yet makes me proud to be a part of the madness- cheers!"
4,A good book but not the condition I was expecting.,"This book is fantastic! I had a well loved copy that I lent to a friend and it has since gone missing. I thought I'd get a used replacement which was listed as being in 'very good' condition, maybe my expectations were too high, but dog-eared pages and a handwritten note in the front cover don't qualify as 'very good' condition to me. That being said, no amount of dog eared pages or notes from strangers can diminish the quality of this book which gets me belly laughing every time I pick it up. This is a great gift to buy for any southern woman or anyone who wishes they were one."
3,"Easy Spirit Women's Piers, Navy","The shoes arrived in excellent condition and were very nice, but they were too short. I always buy a size 8 in an Easy Spirit closed shoe. My advice would be to order 1/2 size larger in this shoe.Thanks,Betty Kelly"
2,Cheap looking and thin material,"I wasn't impressed with these shoes at all. They look cheap and have very thin material. Didn't even try on both shoes. What a shame, since it's surprisingly hard to find navy blue shoes. I'll be sending them back. I also ordered the Easy Spirit Traveltime Mules and they are totally the opposite - well made, sturdy, and pretty comfy."
5,comfortable shoe,Comfortable shoe that will wash. I have this style in three different colors. I'm between a size 7 & 71/2 and I needed the 71/2.
2,"OK, but verify size and flow requirements",Bought this to be able to attach my BBQ to my 5th wheel propane tanks. The hose diameter is too small over the 15' distance and the resulting loss of pressure results in a very small flame.
1,Installation,"According installation manual I have to make a space between gas heater and magic heater 12'' minimum or 24"" maximum. But, right now my gas fired heating boiler has dome type draft hoods. And I know for dome type draft hoods such as the funnel-shaped device the manufacturer of the boiler specifies the required distance from the bottom edge of the hood to the top surface of the boiler. If the draft hood is installed too close to the boiler top, or too high, too far above the boiler top, it will not work properly and the system may be unsafe. If I install the magic heater between gas heater and draft hood, this required distance will be much longer. Magic Heat instruction does not explain that. This Magic Heat can not be install on Weil-McLain Gold CGa gas-fired water boilers or other with dome type draft hoods."
4,Fun for wee ones,"Now your little one can play make believe with their very own plush pocketbook crammed with fun little versions of ""big person"" items. The credit card, cell phone, lipstick and mirror and more are perfectly sized for little hands, there are no hard parts whatsoever, nothing can break or fall off the pieces. All the accessories fit nicely inside the purse, and off you go on your daily adventures with your little person happily toting their very own purse!"
4,Great Chritmas Present!,I got this purse for my neice and she is going to love it! Its going to be a chritsmas present so i have't been able to see her reaction yet but I can't wait. She loves purses so I am positive she will love this. It has all her favorite things. Such a girly girl!
5,Unique!,"This personal, behind-the-scenes account of the occupation of Japan is the only book I've come across on this subject in spite of my interest in WWII history. I found it to be educational and fascinating."
5,Awesome!,This is exactly what I was looking for. The item works great. The customer shipped the item very quickly. Awesome!
2,Stupid purchases 101,"I wish I knew what to do with this. I guess I am really a stupid person.My grandson plays with his Nintendo 64 all the time but when I got thisI wasn't sure what to do with it. You think someone could tell me??It arrived in great condition, and came quickly but I still haven'tgot it out of the box."
1,Accessory Review,This product was not usable or even helpful. It glitched many of my Nintendo 64 games and caused my system to corrupt itself. It was nothing what the reviews I had read said it was. I am not pleased with this product nor will I re-purchase it.
1,DID NOT WORK,"TERRIBLE PRODUCT. I plugged the memory card into my controller and proceeded to play a game for 6 hours, assuming my progress would save. When I turned the game on again, the game said ""memory card error."" I attempted to remove the memory card (not easy as the grip is terrible) and reinsert it, but still nothing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
3,Good,"EDIT: I finally figured out how to access the data managing screen (or whatever you wanna call it). Hold down ""start"" while turning the unit on. That will bring you to it and from there you can delete anything. Nintendo could have made this more accessible, I think."
5,N64 Memory Card,It works great. It was like new out of the box. I've greatly enjoyed actually being able to save my games and be able to play them without leaving the N64 on for days.
3,Cheap plastic and low memory capacity,"Not the best memory card ever, but at least it does it's job. Will not save on games with higher memory requirements. I would not recommend this memory card."
3,Not as advertised,"The picture is misleading, the actual product is twice as long and covered in ad stickers. It functions just fine as a data storage device, but it juts out of the back of the controller in an ungainly manner. I feel I got my money's worth because it is cheap. However, the photo makes it seem like you are getting a reasonable facsimile of the original Nintendo brand product, which it is not."
5,It works,It saves my games and that's all I can ask for. Good product for the money spent. Filler words here.
2,Game card,The transaction on this was very smooth.The product came on time and the price was right.The only problem I am having is the memory card freezes up my game console every time I try to save the game.So really I am not satisfied with the product.This will not be the last time I buy from amazon though it was a good transaction.
2,DONT BUY THIS,"There is a reason why this product is so cheap, because some of them dont work. I had bought 2 and out of them only one was functional. Another note worth to consider is that it does not match the description or the image. My advice would be to buy a memory card for that is actually made by Nintendo instead of buying this brand ""Performance"" but i suppose you can try your luck cross your finger and hope you get one that works."
4,Pretty cool!,"My son is 7 yrs old and we like this a lot. It's interactive (in Batman's voice, ""Tell Me The Secret Code"", ""Access Granted/Denied"", ""Tell Me The Secret Code Again"", etc.)Inside has secret drawers. You can program a number pattern to open it, or use voice recognition. We have difficulty getting it to recognize his voice but it's still very fun. He ends up opening it with the numbers instead. There is a hidden reset button if you forget the password, or want to change your voice."
3,Neighborhood Watch,"Very easy reading. Ended a lot better than I had expected (no Sci-fi stuff). The main character (Kristin) didn't seem too intelligent, just paranoid. The husband (Teddy) had a lot of mystery behind him. Overall it wasn't too bad."
3,Good Thriller...,"I felt this book was a good, not great thriller. It could have been better, in my opinion, if the heroine was a bit more sympathetic. Especially at the beginning of the book, she came off as somewhat ""touchy"" and I didn't really like her very much. So I didn't really care what happened to her. As the book went on she got better and the ending was better than I'd anticipated.Would make a fine ""Movie of the Week""."
4,Enjoyable read,"This book was pretty good. It's not a suspenseful page-turner, but the story flows pretty well and I wasn't bored reading this book. I liked the characters well enough. I would recommend this one."
4,EZ-Start,"Starts first pull every time. We bought this Generator to power a Trailer (& house during rotating blackouts). Since the 5th Wheel only requires 30 Amp service, this Generac powers everything at once: A/C, Water Heater, Refrigerator . . .Although it is quieter than our lawn mower, it's still a bit noisy when run all night. We also looked at Honda Generators. In general, they were quieter, but MUCH more expensive. (Would have been 5 stars if it were as quiet as a $1600 Generator)."
4,a busy builder,this is a very nice and powerful generator. ive had at least six saws running on it at one time and it always carries the load. other guys i work with like honda but they dont have the power that this one has. there is one reason i wont give this 5 stars and that is there is one more of these on my jobsite and we both have problems with oil leaking. it is a small leak barely noticeable but it is still a very annoying problem. other than that i would tell everyone to buy one.
4,Only one suggestion and one wish . . .,"This is an excellent product that proved and paid for itself several times over during our June, 2000, flood, but you must count on being physically healthy to start it, especially during cold weather. We're saving our pennies to buy an electric start model and are hoping Generac will develop a remote starting option so we can get at the generator through our electric garage door when the power is out."
5,Outstanding,"Just ran my 400XL for 56 hours straight due to hurricane Isabel and it ran like a champ! Have had this unit for 3 years and it is quiet and reliable starter. Runs for just shy of 13 hours on one tank of fuel, while powering my refrigerator, freezer, microwave, sump pump, TV, and living room lights. This unit never came close to shutting down due to overusage. I highly recommend this generator."
1,Junk,The Genrjunk they put in motor homes are JUNK. I have had mine for 1 1/2yrs and it is going to shop for the 6th time. Was running and the ehaust pipe fell off on Ground. So had to drive 350 miles to get it fixed I hope will know tomorrow have appointment.
1,This is a Toy and not for Horse collections,"I purchased this horse as an addition for my Horse collection and found that this was a TOY and not appropriate to add to my collection.I was very disappointed and will give this to my grandson.Also, I have paid less for nicer quality model horses, so if you are adding to an existing model horse collection, pass this by(...)"
3,Mixed review,"I purchased this book because I was searching for information on orgasm. My opinion of this book is mixed. The first chapter is an excellent source of info on female anatomy. This chapter, in my opinion, is the only part with outstanding in-depth information of relevance. Chapter two is about the history of sex. The author goes back to Freud and elaborates on views of sex over the years. As another reviewer commented, this chapter contains quips about how women's sexauality has been repressed. Chapter three deals with female ejaculation (was not impressed with this part). Chapters four & five are about self exploration. The book is a quick read. The valable information in this book is contained in chapter one and also in the extensive list of resources in the back."
5,How to enjoy your female body,"I bought this book as a gift for a friend, after having owned my own copy for a few years. It is a very valuable tool for learning the ins and outs of the female body. I thoroughly enjoyed my book and highly recommend it to other women and the men who love them."
1,Socio-political commentary or a review?,"I think the reader from Ibiza fails to understand the difference between editorial comment and book review. Did she in fact read the book, since her only substantive comment refers to Mary Jane Sherfey's out of print title? Those of us who have read this book have the right to express an opinion. Attacking those of us male for some perceived complicity in wrongs against women is stupid; if we're all boors why would we read such a book in the first place? No my complaint is that this book simply fails to deliver on it's promised coverage. Read the book through and then re-read the introduction and you will wonder if you somehow missed about a thousand pages or something.I'm all for men and women reclaiming a knowledge and reverence for sexuality (male as well as female sexuality which our editorialist seems to fail to understand goes a bit beyond ejaculation). Unfortunately this book does little to encourage us to transcend to old battle of the sexes."
4,a male's opinion,"I ordered this book so that I might bring greater pleasure to my wife. Not being female, there is a certain portion of the book which is not directed to me, which is fine. There are some lovely little tidbits (sorry for the idiom!) in the text which I intend to explore in cooperation with my partner. That should be fun.There is little of a graphic nature in the book, so males looking for stimulation may be disappointed.The Clitoral Truth should help bring joy to many women. So be it."
3,Not as creatively jazzy as other Adair albums.,"I wish the play on the keys was richer and creative as other Adair albums. Except perhaps for the Stardust, the rest are honestly quite boring, average adlib similar to humming the tunes yourself."
5,Wonderful toy,"I just gave this toy to my 1 year old niece and she loved it. Her 3 year old brother also played with it for quite a while. It is durable, and there are many things they can do with it. She was busy with it for almost 2 hours. Each day she would pull it out and play with it. I can't say enough about this toy! If the child can not put the shapes in their slots, they can push it through the other side. She likes reaching inside and pulling the shapes out easily. I like that the shapes, once put in don't come out unless you want them to. This is a GREAT toy!"
2,Go for the original.,"This book can be an entertaining way to be initiated on a fascinating time of history if you have no idea of the French history or French revolution.However, if you are not totally unaware of the facts, the book is very shallow and almost totally based on the ""memoirs of the Sansons: From private notes and documents, 1688-1847. By Henry Sanson"".As one can expect, the original source is way more interesting. It gives a remarkable inside of that time, written by the real executioner who was actually living the revolution and not by a quasi ""tourist"" from New York almost 150 years later."
5,A Legacy of Excellence,For anyone who wants to learn of the history of the Sanson family this book is a great point of reference. I plan to read it more than once.
3,Haunted Kansas,"I love ghost stories, but I found this book to be ok. It was very boring and probably would not buy it again."
4,Quenced my thirst for wanting to hear more stories,"This book was a gift for my 30-year old daughter. She said the book is an easy read. It contains a good representation for haunted stories throughout Kansas. Her favorite ones were where there was one main story with other versions that were told through the years. She liked that they weren't bad enough to effect her sleeping except for one about a dog and a pitchfork that she started reading and wouldn't finish. She wished she had read the many stories about Atchison, Kansas, at the end of the book before she went on one of Atchison's Haunted Trolley rides, because the book filled in many holes of the stories told and would have made the tour even more fun."
4,must have,this is a must have album for blues collection. I gave it 4 stars only because I think they could have cleaned up the sound a little better on older recordings. But it is indeed some of John Lee Hooker's best recordings.
4,Nice Intro,"I was pretty J L Hooker stupid when I bought this. I only bought it to have a copy of 'Boom Boom'. But this is pretty good stuff. The guy who is mainly into hard rock and heavy metal is finding this very good. There are a lot of good songs encompassing his career. If you are just beginning to delve into the blues, pick this up."
3,john lee hooker still a great one,what a great chance to hear many of the master's hits.I wonder how this would all differ (maybe Mose Allison would know) if blues masters were here today and might be able to earn a deserved good living.
5,An outright thrilling album.,"If you were looking for the essential, the definitive, the musical picture of the man, this is it. He has a singular deep power in his voice, a fearless intense blues guitar style that is hypnotic elegant and surprising. And his songs will pick you up and shake you."
2,This is murder of culture,"this is the most awful thing one could do to another peoples culture. For the first place Rumi was not indian nor pakistani so why is it the music that is not at all anything like middle-eastern(but a bad mixture of indoamerican) is played. If you want good sufimusic go and buy Shahram Nazeri or Shajarians CDs which you can find in AMAZON.COM , those are the real sufimusic and you can even hear rumi's songs as they were written in his native Persian..Do not satisfy Deepak by buying this CD. And if you want to understand the meaning of the poems buy Rumis' books translated by Kabir Helminski , do not pay the people who not deserved to be paid."
4,Inspiring,"Although I bought the CD with some trepidation (included are readings by Madonna, Demi Moore, and Goldie Hawn), it's a great CD. Rumi's inspiring words of love and spirit shine through the whole time. And the music in the background is wonderful."
2,This is a commercial cheap work from Chopra,"I admire Rumi, Sufis and Persian poetry, and I am glad to see that Rumi's love poems inspire humans from various countries and cultures in our century. But this work, Gift of Love, is not to my taste. It is a cheap work -- a commercial work from Chopra. The music is not authentic -- it is neither Persian or Turkish (where Rumi lived, danced and made poems) nor an American pop music inspired by Rumi. The booklet that comes with Album is also cheap and I could not understand why all pictures are from India! In the booklet Chopra claims that as a boy he was fascinated by Rumi's poetry. As a person who knows India quite well, I strongly doubt this: Very very few Indian Hindus (adults let alone boys) read Islamic/Sufi poetry. Oh well, who cares about this: Now that Rumi is a trendy poet in the US, why not make some fast money."
4,"Beautiful, Moving, Let Rumi Touch You!","This is one of the most beautiful CDs out there. Put it on, close your eyes, and let your spirit soar. There seem to be two groups who have written reviews, those that analyze the music in terms of culture, commercial success, and character profiles of those involved, and those who open up to it as musical poetry and let it move them as a beautiful work of art. I am of the latter and it's really an incredible work. I would give it a five but one of the songs has a stressful/minor tone that doesnt belong with inspirational Rumi poetry. But I highly recommend this CD!"
4,If only I could feel and have the Gift of Love!,"As I sit in my tiny apartment, the music of Deepak & friends, includes Madonna, I listen with bated breath for the beauty of the words of love by the poet, ""Rumi"" as they are spoken over the group of up-to-date Indian music. The cd has tremendous warmth, pleasure, and eroticism. The first song to me is the most beautiful and romantic, almost to the point where you might want to cry but then Madonna speaks in her husky sexy voice and you just want to turn to your lover and kiss, hug, make love with candles and sandlewood incense all night! While I listened to this cd I was reading the last chapter of Anatomy of the Spirit by Caroline Myss and it was the most perfect complement to any stay alone evening. Too bad it was not longer ..... forever...."
2,Not what I expected,"I didn't know this was a reading on poems. I thought it would have more music. For me it was kinda hard to understand Deepak when he talked but I could understand the others. I like reading much more than hearing the CD. Although, others might find this CD perfect. Just my thoughts."
5,a gift of love indeed!,i am lost for words. this cd is a truly amazing. i love every track...all i can say is i am just filled with love at the moment. i highly recommend this.
4,I love the Poems by Rumi,I love the poems. This first volume has more emphasis on the poems as oppose to the second volume which has great instruments and poems.
2,Small Poems are not why Rumi is famous??!!,"It is interesting that westerners are so Islamophobic that they totally omit Rumi's most important work about Islamic Mysticism (aka sufism) which is called the Mathnawi ( a six volume Poem).The Mathnawai is Rumi's best work and has been translated in english beautifully, while being itself a work of immense and sublime beauty. Since it is about ISLAM, and God, I guess it is not worth touching.'Mathnawi' is what made Rumi immortal and put him on the map, Not his 'Love Poems' to be mutilated by some pop-psychs and of all fake people 'Madonna'."
2,Rumi poems drowned in loud music,I'm a Persian. I've read and heard Rumi poems since I was about eleven. I don't mind that Rumi's poems are mixed up with music from India. However it would be more delightful if the music was Persian too. The cd is marketed with a stress on Rumi poetry but it seems to me that Deepak is more interested in letting Rumi poems carry his music. The voice of the readers of the poems is most often drowned in high volume music such that I have problem hearing what they are saying. The two stars are for the poems and the readers (that can almost be heard!).
4,"A Magical, Mystical, Musical, Meditative Mantra...",The first time I heard this CD A Gift of Love I was getting a massage and my massage therapist had it playing in the background. I immediately connected with the mystical music and the magical mantras that various artists were singing/speaking. I was on a mission to purchase this CD for myself! I looked everywhere and fortunately found in on AMAZON. I received the CD within a week of ordering it and am extremely satisfied! The only thing that could be improved upon is it could be longer. The CD itself is around 53 minutes which seems a bit short to me. Otherwise I love it.
5,Gift Of Love: Deepak & Friends,"This is an exquisite CD. The poems, music and the beauty it all encompasses makes it a superb CD to hear, enjoy and meditate on as you drift into it."
5,This is truly poetry in motion...,"As a long time lover of Rumi's poetry, I was more than pleased to discover it has now been put to music with the great chorus of friends and celebrities that this CD brings to the heart and soul. Rumi is nothing less than Love on fire, pure and simple. This music and the soft voices reading this work move one in ways only a fine combination of poetry and music like this can do. Bringing to this world a richness that we rarely hear amongst the clamor of our hurried times. Reminding us in the traditions of all the old world religions that Love is, indeed, the greatest power in the universe!"
5,Great Crate,"In the past I have used the old stand by wire crates for my dogs. I recently got a new puppy (a Maltipoo) who is smaller than the dogs I have had in the past, so I was looking for a smaller wire crate, when I found this. I love it! This crate is easy to take up and down. When visiting relatives, it is very easy to pack up and take with us. With soft sides, I frequently find the puppy leaning against the sides as he is sleeping. The ""walls"" on top and around the sides and front make it really easy to see what is going on inside the crate. I bought the small, which gives him plenty of room to move around. At night I have him sleeping in a small airline crate. He is getting too big for that, so I am thinking of getting the extra small for night time use."
3,Down to Earth is missing,"This re-mastered CD left off what I consider the best song from the original LP which I owned years ago, which just happens to be the title song, ""Down To Earth"". I was very disappointed."
3,ok,"I probably didn't enjoy this book as much as alot of members of the Church do/did. I found it repetitive and overly descriptive. I enjoyed the actual historical parts and some of that did move me to tears. Truly, I am just not fond of the way it was written.I apprecite the author's attempt to make it interesting, but I feel the handcart pioneers stories are enough on their own. They don't need fluff. It felt like it was written for 5th graders. Which is ok I guess, just not my style. Could be I just don't like historical fiction.I'm about to tackle another book on the subject I hope I enjoy more. Not historical fiction."
2,Just as good the second time around!,"When I first read this book, I was overwhelmed! I read The Work And The Glory, so was familiar with the author. Gerald Lund made me a part of the handcart trip, and a member of each family. I am enjoying it again, and just as overwhelmed as the first time! It reminded me of the strength of the Mormon Pioneers. This is a book that will stay in my library, so that I may read it several more times! (I meant to put 5 stars!)"
4,fire of the covenant,"Interesting story. Its well written,@ researched,and easy to read. I wanted to keep reading tosee what was going to happen next to thesepoor people. Quite the story."
5,What the fire for the covenant can produce,"Excellent novel. Although the book is lenghty, the reading is exciting and fast paced. It is based on true accounts of the handcart companies whose members walked from Iowa to the Morman's promised land of Utah in bad weather and good, warm and extremely cold pulling wooden carts behind them containing everything that owned in this world. Very few people, if any, in todays society would undertake such a journey as this. Regardless of your religious views, you cannot help but admire these people for their resolve and tenacious."
4,A great intro to reggae,"I recently got interested in reggae music and wanted to expand my horizons beyond the great Bob Marley. This compilation of tracks from Island Records artists is a terrific sampler and it exposed me to a lot of great reggae artists that I was otherwise not familiar with (Toots and the Maytals, Jimmy Cliff, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, and many others.) The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that some of the newer tracks (from the 1990s) are a little weak in my opinion. If you are looking to explore reggae though, this is a good place to start."
1,CD was blank!!!!,"This was a gift, consequently I was not only angry but embarrassed as well to find out the CD was blank. This was such a highly regarded radio program...I expected their product to be the same. $17 wasted."
1,NOT SENCO!,"Generic, broken in hundreds of little pieces.Packaged in a white box (no name) way too big so if you enjoy inserting ten staples at a time... buy these."
4,Worked great on the floor,Worked great on the floor. As long as you do not hit any nails or screws underneath then it will bend and you have to pull it out or bend it over which is very hard to do.If you are puting down a floor you need this one so it will not rust.
4,Product works fine however....,"As others have stated, Amazon packing robots need to get their act together. Package completely open and loose in the box with other items. Thankfully mine were still in long strips...needed to tape the box back together. Senco glue on the box was dried out too...so it didn't hold together well anyways on its own....Staples worked perfectly in Bynford stapler."
1,"Cheap, stupid SONY.","How any engineer in his right mind can design a television in this day and age with NO AUDIO OUT boggles the freaking mind---especially when the total hardware cost for a headphone jack would be about 25 cents. The sound on this behemoth is atrocious---steely, ear-piercing, and so wildly varying as to be inaudible one minute and shaking the walls the next minute. And, of course, since there is no AUDIO OUT you can't play it through better speakers.If you are a deaf shut-in or the Unabomber then this is for you. If you have another person in your house---or a neighbor within 100 feet, do yourself a favor and buy a more complete set. SHAME ON YOU SONY for unleashing this on the public."
2,"I regret the purchase, this model has a known issue","I wish I'd read more reviews before purchasing this set. The minimum volume on digital channels is loud and irritating, too loud to hold a conversation, to use the sleep mode, to read a book, or browse the web with the tv on in the background. (In loudness, it's equivalent to turning up the volume to 50% of the full range while playing a DVD.) This happens using an ordinary indoor rabbit-ears antenna, not through a cable box, satellite connection, surround-sound system, or any other device or amplifier. It applies to all programming on all digital channels, not just commercials. Sony Tech Support seems to be unaware of the problem, but I've found it mentioned in several consumer reviews."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Got this from bestbuy with 3 year onsite warranty. After 13 months started making strange beeping noise. Got it fixed twice, problem still persist.Picture quality is not at all that good, I see bright spot in the center.Do not waste money on it. Sony SUCKS."
1,"Not available, AMAZON!!!","AMAZON!!! If a product isnt available and you say it is and I pay for it with my personal cc info, thats bad business! Shame on AMAZON...!"
1,Terrible Product,"Product and Sony support were absolutely horrible. After 3 months, no picture or sound with standby light blinking. I followed manual instructions and then contacted service providers. Sony had two on website, one with disconnected number, the other would not work on TV. Next step, onto the live Sony chat. Only thing they could tell me was to review the user manual and then gave me the same two service providers I had already tried to contact. Next step, onto the home service call in number at Sony. The service person was able to tell me that the number for one of the service providers listed on the website was the wrong number. Thanks. Could not resolve issue or find another service provider in Northern Virginia - outside DC???? Next step, placed TV on curb."
2,Better versions are available,"This is a mediocre telling of Prokofiev's story (which it incorrectly calls a folktale). With only a few pages, you're better off not reading this book at all and just listening to the story and music on a CD recording. If you're looking for a decent Peter and the Wolf book, though, try Ian Beck's excellent version."
4,Family Pictures,"I have read many children's books; this book however, isn't really a book for reading. It's greatest attribute are it's pictures. It does have a small descriptive paragraph opposite each picture in both English and Spanish, therefore making the book accessible to many different children. It is a great multicultural book; you can learn about the culture and traditions of a Mexican American family. It is a good book to develop multiculturalism and can be used in many ways in the classroom."
4,The Best,This is a book with rich colors and rich story in both languages to serve the Latino population or the English speaking pop. You will enjoy the story and appreciate the beauty of the culture.
5,"Wonderful performance, well directed presentation",David is just terrific here. The presentation is very professional. Camera coverage of the performers is most satisfying. Sounds good as well. Wish it was longer.
2,Caffeine Overload,"If you love coffee this is a book for you! There were more casual references to making coffee, types of coffee drinks, quality of coffee, caffeine and side effects that there was hardly room for a mystery. While other books from this series have been engaging this one lacked focus. It started with an interesting concept that was lost along the way. Short shrift was given to her family life that has been so interesting in the past and certainly Julian is more than ""our family friend"" for sure. I have loved this author from the start and look forward to her next book with hopes she goes back to incorporating the characters we already love."
1,Loosen your belts,"It seems all they do in this book is cook and eat! This is the second only book I've read by this authour. I could care less about the receipes, I'm not going to try any of them. And those women that had nothing better to do with their time and husband's money than shop, shop, shop for so much stuff they had to rent additional storage places. I did enjoy the description of the scenery in the Aspen area, but that was about the only redeeming aspect of this story. Talk about spoiled kids and pampered wives, I'm glad I don't know any of them. I'll move on to others than can really keep me interested in their mysteries."
1,Chopping Spree,"I love Diane Mott Davidson's books and not only own all the books but also all her books on tape. Ms. Davidson's story is wonderful as always but I was very disappointed BARBARA ROSENBLAT DID NOT NARRATE THIS ONE. Didn't realize that until I received the tapes--I WISH I'D SAVED MY MONEY. Joyce Bean is an ok narrator I guess but her reading of this book is lifeless, flat and boring when compared to the energy, character voices and humor Ms. Rosenblat pours into her readings of this series. I don't know which character is speaking most of the time. I had so looked forward to the release of this tape and it never dawned on me anyone but Rosenblat would narrate, so I didn't even check that out. Next time, believe me, I will and won't purchase any that don't include Ms. Rosenblat."
2,This is getting old.,"I've read, and enjoyed, the other Goldie Schultz books by Davidson, but this one is the least enjoyable. The characters are increasingly 2 dimensional and it's time to add a little more depth to them. At least there is nothing of Goldie's abusive ex husband in this book. That is a relationship I am getting very tired of reading about. Goldie's son, Arch, has become a whiny, rude, abusive (at least verbally) and thoroughly repellant character who needs to have his behind paddled, not his every whim indulged. Most 15 year olds would not be allowed to indulge in this type of behavior with impunity. The plot in this book is disturbing - a group of people who find acquisitiveness and one-upsmanship more important than friendship, kindness or even civility. Even Marla, Goldie's old friend, and one of the more interesting characters in the books, has succummed to this type of behavior. I doubt I will be reading any more of Davidson's books."
2,Going Down,"I have read all of Diane Mott Davidson's books starting with "" Catering To Nobody"" and have really seen her grow as a novelist and mystery writer. However, the last few books have shown a definate decline and have been a real disappointment. She seems to be making up for a lack of plot by trying to make us drool over rich, expensive food. (Why doesn't Goldy weigh 300 lbs?)The characters in this book are also poorly drawn---Tom is spineless and does little but cook while allowing Goldy to solve the crime by breaking numerous laws, Ash has turned into a completely self-centered, materialistic, spoiled brat, and Goldy herself seems to live to indulge the brat while enjoying the abuse he heaps upon her. She also solves crimes by going where no caterer has gone before. I think I have had enough of these senseless stories."
2,not the most enthralling read,"The writer's attmempt to distract the reader w/ recipes and the preparations of thereof,proved to whet my appetite-for food only!The first few chapters moved at an incredibly slow pace. It got to the point that I put the book down to break up the monotony! The book also lacked depth, which I've come to expect from a mystery.My opinion of the book was very low;it was a generic and unexciting read. I felt that if a reader wasn't looking for a mystery that he could sink his teeth into, but just wanted to sharpen up on his cooking and baking skills, then this book would be for him. However, I became more generous w/ my opinion toward the end of the book when I actually started becoming interested in who was really responsible for the crime. The ending was actually more satisfying than the other parts of the book. If you're a patient reader, and love to salivate over descriptions of mouth watering dishes, you may enjoy the book."
3,Enjoyable but flawed,"I have read all of this author's mysteries and find them enjoyable and entertaining, but with one big flaw: Arch. Or perhaps I should say Goldie's responses to Arch. This relationship mars the enjoyment of the books. On the other hand, what can one expect from a teen-ager whose father is a pathological liar who is in jail for assault, and whose mother has absolutely no respect for the laws against breaking and entering, forgery, concealing evidence (and that's just in this book - in previous books her lawbreaking would certainly have landed her in prison. Not even Tom would be able to protect her.) And why doesn't she trust Tom with the evidence she uncovers?I guess the best way to read these books is to consider the characters caricatures of real people.I have never tried any of the recipes in these books, but one or two in Chopping Spree actually look eatable. At least they are not all diet foods. I get very tired of the menus that are fish, pasta, and more fish."
3,Chopping Spree,"Davidson's books are easy reads and good for vacationing, but no mind challengers. I've found that, after reading several over the years, I'm impatient with the main character who often comes across as a bungling, stupid ""female"". Not a good strong female role model. Luckily, the plot lines are at least interesting and the recipes make for a nice side bar."
5,I love this series...,I have a combination of the hard copies of this book and the Kindle version. LOVE the book.Could the Kindle folks PLEASE CORRECT THE NAME to MARLA from MARIA? It is annoying! Every D. Mott Davidson book on Kindle has the same defect. I think there is another one (name inaccuracy) but I cannot recall which one it is.LOVE THE BOOK! WHEN IS SHE COMING OUT WITH HER COOKBOOK????? I WANT THEM ALL!Barb G
3,not the author's best,"I have been reading the Goldy series and while I enjoyed the book, I have read better. I wish less was said about her bratty son and more about her husband. On to the next in the series"
1,Disappointing Effort,"Living in Colorado, I have been reading this series from the beginning. Although it was never the best of the genre, it was a fun, light read. Now, it is boring, with characters who are totally unbelievable. Looks like it is time for Ms. Davidson to call a halt to Goldy (and especially her son and ex) and try something different."
2,THIS JUST SHOULDA' BEEN CHOPPED,This refers to the audio version of the book - I almost felt as though a ghost writter had written what I was hearing. The narrator was not at all as good as Cherry Jones and for some strange reason Diane has resorted to some less than nice language that was not in the earlier books (that I have read and I have not read them all). Too bad - this just doesn't rise to the level of her other books - a big disappointment.
2,Not so hot -- worst of series,"B""HI've liked all of the Dianne Mott Davidson books, but this was the weakest, by far. What a snotty kid Arch has turned into -- made worse by the fact that the new character, Liz, also has a spoiled brat. The both need a dose of Dr. Laura.It's one thing to create unsavory characters to heighten tension, it's quite another to fill the book with them. In this one, there's no one to like -- It actually occured to me to wonder who really wrote this thing.Maybe it's time to leave Goldy and Liz to their futures of bailing out their kids -- literally -- and focus on Julian, instead. He's the only one to have his act together.So-so plot, annoying characters, not especially interesting recipes. I won't be looking forward to the next one quite as much...."
3,not Davidson's best but still enjoyable,"This latest in the generally excellent culinary mystery series by Diane Mott Davidson, is a little less inspired than some of her other works. Even the recipes are more mundane----a quiche recipe you could find in a lot of cookbooks, a roast beef with burgundy recipe that has also been around a long time.Goldy Schulz' teenage son Arch is in a difficult period now, and readers will miss his tractable sweetness of earlier books. Julian is in---catch this---JAIL as a murder suspect. Goldy's best friend Marla appears infrequently, as does her stalwart cop husband, Tom. For much of the book Goldy is on her own, trying to withdraw (without much success) from her twin pleasures of caffeine and chocolate, even as she suffers from various injuries incurred in the course of her investigation of the murder.If you're new to the series, read some of the earlier books first to get to know Goldy, Tom, Arch and company. This one's a lesser light among many bright books."
2,It is time for Arch to move on,I have read every one of these books about Goldy Shulz. I could hardly finish this one. Goldy doesn't seem to realize that Arch is actually abusing her verbally. At this point Ms. Davidson should just write Arch out of the series (he could go to college or in the military). His existence doesn't add anything positive to the story lines and in fact I had to make myself finish this book because his antics were so annoying.
3,Good flick,fairly good classic movie. Waited for over two years to get it on Netflix and it was never available so I bought it just so we could watch it. Now I'll turn around and sell it to someone else. Seller shipped promptly.
5,Black Ice - My Favorite,"I have purchased these 3 packs previously at twice the price from local auto stores. I combined these with another larger order and got free shipping. Of all the Little Tree scents out there, ""Black Ice"" is my favorite. It's not overpowering, but you pleasantly know it's there in the background. One tree will last about 2-3 weeks."
4,billy joe obviously knows nothing,this is a great first book. Im sure Im interested to see the next one.
1,garbage,i would'nt advise purchasing this controller. Like all things now a days it's made in china while that's not the draw back feature of this device the cheap construction and weak durabilty of it is. after just a few hours out of the box the thumb controls begain to go bad. eventually causingme to toss this $15.00 + S/H in the trash bin.
3,Not Ella's best...,"This CD is not really Ella's best... the sound is rather poor, and in some places the arrangements could be more tasteful. It is worth getting, but to new listeners I HIGHLY recommend the excellent ""Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie."""
5,Partnership with God,"This is a must read for those interested in true revival. I also thought it quite true and eye opening that Finney dispells many incorrect beliefs about revival that exist today even though the book is over 150 years old. The first and foremost is a parable he tells about farming. Tell a farmer that he should not sow seed, till, water or weed because a harvest is a sovereign act of God and we will all starve. Yes God makes the harvest grow, but man has his part. Likewise a spiritual harvest does not happen without man doing his part. There has never been a revival in the history of the church that broke out without being birthed thru people's intercession and seeking God. A main reason the American church is starving is because they are not willing to work with God for the harvest. This is a real eye opener and a great place to start for those seeking revival."
5,Excellent and powerful,"There is a common theme among Finneys lectures that stands out to me, and that is the importance of the here and now. If you read this book prepare to deal with the topic of ""revival"" personally and immediately, for that is exactly what he asks you to do. When you contrast the principles of revival that Charles Finney outlines in great detail and conviction, it will bring light and correction to the revivals of the present day. I highly recommend this book to any one who is interested in revival. You will draw many truths that will allow you to experience this necessary experience, even if its just on a personal level, for these truths can be applied in your own prayer closet, or as it was, nationwide as seen in Finneys time."
1,Headhunter revivalism!,"This whole book presents revival (and salvation in general), not as a gracious miracle given by G-d according to His sovereign will and time, but rather as something that man must 'promote' by his own means, using the Holy Spirit almost like a common tool.Mr. Finney was a modern-day Pelagian - he did not believe that man was totally corrupted by sin (Romans 3), and so logically built his false theology upon the premise that man can and must effectively earn and promote his own salvation, as well as the salvation of others, through regular, systematic means such as the ones presented in this book.If you want a better review of the kind of false 'revival' that Finney is describing, read the book, 'Revival and Revivalism' by Iain H. Murray."
1,product does not match picture,As the picture shows it looks like you are getting the table. When I ran it up on the net for portable picnic table this picture of the table and umbrella showed up. I got confused. The umbrella showed up at my house for a huge amount of 24.00. I sent it back but they charged me postage. I will not use this company again.
3,Beware of the recipes,"I baked the German chocolate cake. Frozen grated unsweetened coconut was impossible to find... So I found unsweetened coconut. Cooking the frosting for 20 minutes turned into a dry frosting after you added the unsweetened coconut... other than that the cake was amazing I will bake it again, I will have to find another recipe for the coconut pecan frosting... if the directions would of given a temperature to cook the frosting to that would of been more precise."
1,Do NOT try this at home...,"This is a beautiful book with filled wonderful ideas. However, the recipes are very bad. I am an experienced baker who attempted a few of cakes with along with a chef, whose history includes an honors degreee from the French Culinary Institute in NYC. We both agree - the recipes are just plain bad. The directions and instructions are not only vague, they assume you can get from point A to point D. If you want to make the cakes in this book, find the recipe elsewhere. I would actually like to know how the author made the cakes in the photographs, because she certainly did not rely on these recipes alone."
5,Wonderful cookbook!,"We received this cookbook as a gift, and I have have enjoyed reading the stories behind the cakes and the visual presentation of each cake is fabulous. And then we made the Comforts Coconut Cake with lemon curd filling. It might be the best cake I have ever eaten, and mine looked as beautiful as the picture in the book. I brought it for a family dinner and got rave reviews. And it really was easy to make!"
2,Just OK,"DVD is short in playtime and contains alot of the ""less popular"" songs. My kids are HUGE Backyardigans fans so I ignored to bad reviews this DVD had received... wish I hadn't."
4,I recommend this book,"I took an online class over the summer and used this book. Eventhough the teacher was not helpful, the book was. All the exercises were extremely helpful and the text was simple and easy to read. I would recommend this book for any who has to take this class."
1,Not What It Seems,"I clicked on a link for a paper-back version of the actual text, this is just the solutions to the problems in the book. Entirely unnecessary. Mostly Amazon's fault."
1,Does NOT come with a Tutorial on CD,"I purchased this book brand new and full priced because it is listed as havinga MathXL Tutorial on CD. I felt the aid of interactive instruction would be beneficial. Since having recieved this book and inquiring of Amazon, I find the book does NOT come with a CD but with an online address for a website with instruction which costs and ADDITIONAL $35.00 to access. The title is incorrect and misleading, and making this transaction with Amazon has been disappointing. I will think twice before I make another.Finite Mathematics (9th Edition) (MathXL Tutorials on CD Series)"
2,Drivel!,"Absolute Drivel! This novel tells the story of an heiress, Miss Susanna Chadwick, that runs away from her evil uncle and ends up stranded at the home of an impoverished Baron Lindale. In less than a week she decides to marry the baron, and he decides to marry her and both ""fall in love.""There is absolutely no chemistry between the hero and heroine. In fact, I cannot even determine how they fell in love on such short acquaintance. Then to compound matters, the heroine vacillates between marrying the hero. I will marry him, no I won't marry him, yes, I will, etc... It is the worst farce. The only saving grace to this whole book, is that Ms. McRae writes well, even if the content of her book is awful. She has written better novels. Save your money and don't buy this one."
4,"This one has narration and ""A"" list stars","Unlike other similar videos available on amazon, this one has narration, shows ""A"" list mainstream actresses (not obscure ones) and covers both the 70's and the entire 80's. You can probably find a lot of these scenes on the internet if you search hard enough, but I liked the idea of having the clips handpicked for me and presenting them in this context was perfect, besides you don't have to worry about viruses and spam this way. Image quality of the clips was pretty good too."
2,jimbo reviews celeb skin,It was ok I guess. Some scenes disappointed me the lighting is too dark or it did not show any good nudity. They selected scenes that don't show clear view of celebs. Don't bother buying it.
3,Good review,"It was as expected, butt it could have been more in depth. Each section was a little short, and could have been expanded beyond the basic this, that and thats enough."
3,Fun for a short time.,"My twins received these for Christmas and they loved the time they spent painting and decorating the trucks. However, the trucks are not of top quality (think inexpensive plastic similar to what you would find at the Dollar Store) and my sons quickly stopped playing with them after the decoration part was over. So, while the concept is awesome, the product may be a little overpriced for what it actually is."
5,monster trucks,"I was snowed in unable to leave my home, it was my grandsons 4th birthday and I am in OK , He is in CA. I was so happy to fink this give on line with free shipping. little Charlie loved his birthay present, and I was pleased with the promptness of sending the parcel out to him."
4,GOOD CREATIVITY WITH THIS TOY.,"Purchased this kit for my grandson's 9th birthday. He had a great time designing a truck with his friend. Great to find an educational toy that also brings out his creativity. Now he has his ""own"" monster trucks to add to his growing collection. This Amazon toy was delivered with great speed and at a good price."
3,Stickers don't fit on Trucks!,The creativity fun that I thought I was getting for my son wasn't that at all! The stickers that come with the trucks are too big to fit on the truck body!! The only ones that worked were the stars - all the others were too large to fit in the small spaces on the trucks! The paint is OK - it did not cover as nicely as it could have. My son only painted one - it was not that exciting for him because it is very difficult to actually paint words or any kind of picture. I also had trouble helping. The trucks themselves are fairly durable and unique. I would recommend this only for the trucks - not for the creativity of decorating or personalizing them!!
2,Looked cool in the picture,"Extremely disatisfied...The trucks themselves were actually pretty good. But dont waste the extra dollars for the stickers and paint. The paint was dried out and we had to throw it out and the stickers dont fit anywhere on any of the trucks like you would imagine, they are way to big. Overall they tried to do something cool that didnt work out."
5,monster truck legos,My grandson LOVED this item ! He has spent many hours with his friends playing with this Lego set. I hope to purchase more Lego sets for him in the future.
4,Stop teasing us ...,"I love this show! I hope CBS decides to produce DVD sets of the last 2 seasons! It is irksome to have to wait so long to complete my set! If there are no plans to release this show traditionally, they should consider making it available MOD! For a company that claims to put their shows on a pedestal this is hardly a shining example! To give credit where it's due though, CBS does the best job of transferring their shows to dvd! Check out the DVD box sets of the original Mission Impossible, Hawaii 5-0, and Mannix! They all look incredible!"
5,Amazing Series,"Seriously one of the most ingenious drama series of ALL TIME! It has something for everyone: action, comedy, romance, mystery, and inspiration. Definitely a must-see."
4,Decent DVD boxset for a quality 90's TV series,"This second season boxset played virtually fine (I tested each chapter of all 22 episodes on the five discs).I remember watching the first season of Early Edition (well most of it) on ITV back in the late 90's and it was a lot of fun and a warm drama. It's just a shame that it only lasted four seasons and didn't last longer.There was a delay in the UK for the second season. Eventually Sky One premiered it in the UK (along with the third and fourth seasons). I only caught the first two episodes, the season premiere ""Home"" and ""Faith"". So I'm glad that CBS DVD have finally released the second season on Region 1 after a twelve month wait.Fingers crossed they release the third season around the same time next year (around June/July 2010), with episodic promos for all 23 episodes if possible, and the alternative ending to the second season episode ""Hot Time in the Old Town"" as DVD extras."
5,I really liked the series and need to buy the last one.,"I have loved Kyle Chandler for many years when this series first came out and was happy to see him in Friday Night Lights and he is the main reason I bought the entire 5 seasons of that. I do want the last of this one too. He is a good actor but what is better--he plays good men and I adore a good man, never having been lucky enough to have found one myself."
4,Really Good Pedal!!!!,"I would say that this is really a good pedal to buy. It could be used for many different sounds for many different styles. Sounds good with a clean tone. But not too good with a distorted amp. But probably could be used with an overdrive pedal or something like that, because mine sounds great with my zakk wylde overdrive pedal. But its atleast worth a try. I really recommend it."
1,Zero stars,"This remote ""forgets"" the code you've programmed into it and has to be reprogrammed constantly or it will stop working on your device. I have to program mine at least once a day. Buy something, anything, else!"
5,PREPARE TO BLAST YOUR SPEAKERS,"I'M A TRUE FAN OF THE BAND. SO I HAD TO GET THIS CD ALSO.THE CD IS GOOD.MY ONLY CONCERN IS THE MUSIC WAS RECORDED WAY TO QUIET.SO ANY FAN WILL HAVE TO PUT THEIR SPEAKERS AT TO FULL VOLUME JUST TO HEAR IT.OTHER THAT THAT, IT'S A GREAT CD"
4,Only 50 pages of XML,"Disclaimer: I just got this book and have not read it yet.It has about 280 pages of HTML stuff and 50 pages of XML. I expected a little more XML, so I'm decrementing 1 star for now."
4,Very Cool,"Well, As A guy who has his own web page, I find that it is very important to have a neat looking website, in order to aquire an audience. However, getting a website to look excelent, requires hard work. So, After Checking This Book Out At the Borders Store, I thought this book might be a nessecity for my webpage. Basically, HTML is the origin of all web designs, and anything computer related. This Book Has NEVER let me down, and has become my new best friend! At First, I had to re-read a lot of things in order to get everything straight, but now its a lot easier! I think you should get this book, because believe it or not, It WILL pay off in the long run! Your shooting yourself in the foot if you DONT get it !!! So, what are you waiting for? Get This Book!"
2,Only okay...,We saw the Barra's in Nova Scotia in October 2011. They were great. This album is only so-so compared to others we have.
2,Just okay,"I wanted to love this book. It was given to me by a friend. But it disappointed me on several levels. The war story part is intriguing, but the veracity of the account is suspect (feels like it must be fictionalized in some way). The personal account also feels forced, as if the author doesn't really have that much of her own story to tell, so she had to tell her dad's. Finally, the whole subplot with the weird guy in mirrored sunglasses ended up making no sense and it felt like a trick. This memoir unfortunately does not stand up to many other great ones. It is not a bad book, just not brilliant."
2,Book jacket blurb lies,"Funny? No. Heartbreaking? Sure, in a way. ""Told without an ounce of self-pity."" Hmmm. I wouldn't say that's true. Who wrote the book jacket? Who wrote these reviews? Probably friends of Danielle Trussoni. Take all of this with a boulder of salt."
1,A me-me-me memoir,"I wanted to like this book, Falling From The Earth, and I ran out and bought it. But I really didn't like it. I found the main character to be unlikeable--- self-absorbed and a little crapulous. (Is that a word?) Especially in the stiff war scenes that supposedly her father told her about in exquisite literary detail and also with the obviously confabulated stalker that she unbelievable tracks down at the end. The book really reminded me of the kind of tall tales people tell on bar stools: long, rambling, and all about me. I agree with the kid (?) who said the memoir was a bit suspect in terms of the truth. However, I imagine that there are some truths about Vietnam (and one's self) that are hard to face. But it makes it more interesting when the author does."
1,Chick Lit,"Dude, I'm a sucker. This book is chick lit masquerading as some kind of commentary about war. The author is so into herself. She made me so mad I couldn't finish it. I want my money back!"
2,Just not that good,"I enjoy memoirs, and while this one has a few good moments, overall it's just not that good. The writing is decent (but not great), the stories aren't all that interesting, and I don't like the structure of the book. It didn't flow; it felt like she wrote a few essays, and then tried to string them together. The parts where she is in Vietnam are pointless filler. I hate to be so harsh, but a memoir needs to be compelling in some way, and this one isn't."
2,A Disappointment,"I was bored with this book but finished it because I wanted it to be better! I kept reading, hoping for something. Never found it!!!!"
5,"Good, but don't waste your money","Really, I don't see why the hell anyone would want to buy this. It's basically the same exact thing as the origional sourcebook, only with more dated rules and one or two historical facts. Anyone with half a brain or a bit of imagination should be easily able to set a Vampire story in the Dark Ages without this book. Even if it IS a really nice book with great art, great print, and interesting interpretations of dark age history.I say don't buy it; save your money for more useful things like the sourcebooks and clanbooks. I got my copy secondhand (In Tokyo, of all places) for the equivilant of $10 so there was no big waste. I pity the fool who shells out all 25 clams for this."
2,Extention hose,I found out you have to purchase a separate regulator for this hose to fit. The hose that comes with my Mr. Heater can't be taken apart by the regulator.So I sent it back. No problems.
5,Much needed,I purchased this hose to allow me to use my Camp Chef weekender stove off the propane tanks on my rv tailer and be able to locate the stove where I needed to place it at the different camp sites. Now I don't have to tote another propane tank around when we go camping and worry about it's safety during travel.
5,One of the best!,"This album is one of my perennial favorites and one of the best salsa purchases I've ever made. EVERY song on this album is really good! Most, if not all of the songs, can also be found on other compilations -- just an indication of how many people enjoy them and how broadly they are appreciated. I've also been to lots of NYC Mambo events -- both in the clubs and at the socials, and these songs often pop up, even though they were released years ago. This album will never get old; you'll love listening to it every time!"
1,"Worked for 4-5 months, then failed","Installed 2 of these, one made it through the winter, the other did not. Washer fluid was used, not water and never froze. These pumps are poorly made, the first one I received leaked off the bat. Amazon returned, today I replaced the other one, also leaking.On a 99 Jeep Cherokee, you have to remove the front header panel and drivers side fender to get to these, expect about an hour just to get access to the pump. ***when taking off the fender, there is one bolt in the middle on the bottom. If you are looking for that last fastener, that's where it is."
3,Don't complain about missing battery,It is not possible to ship a lead acid battery in a ready to use condition. The acid can spill and is very hazardous. Would you feel better if it had a battery but you had to take the battery to a service center to get the acid put in?The only problem is that the information should be better. There should be a bold label stating the lack of a battery and why and also a list of various batteries that can be used. A garden tractor battery would most likely do fine and they are about 20 dollars and widely available .
2,I guess I didn't read carefully enough,"But I thought it was the whole season of Ponderosa, but it was only half the season. I was very disappointed, but still enjoyed the episodes I did get!"
1,Disgraceful attempt to cash in on Bonanza's talent and success,"This was a ridiculous attempt to cash in on the original television series, Bonanza. It was horribly written, and totally disregarded everything that was genuine and beautiful about the Cartwrights as portrayed on Bonanza by Greene, Roberts, Blocker and Landon.If you loved the original Cartwrights, it's worth re-watching Bonanza and forgetting about this terrible ""prequel."""
2,disturbed,to bad this thing was made by someone who hates america and is a radical left wing nut this show has nothing to do with bonanza
4,perfect resource!,It's a great resource if you are new to conducting meta-analyses. I gave it a 4 just b/c it's getting a little outdated...
3,"Nice Idea, Poor Development",Porter provides a nice correlation between warfare and the rise of the nation state. However many of the ideas that he presents do not really come together well. He provides plenty of evidence but does a poor job of pulling it all into a coherent theme. It definitely gets you thinking about the role war played in increasing the power of the state. It does leave many questions. Its worth a shot for the politically astute.
1,Just Say No!,"One star is very generous for this particular CD. I bought this CD thinking I was getting an incredible deal, NOT! It's comparable to circus music. It's like karoke music, no words, totally electric keyboard. In this case ""Music Machine"" REALLY means music machine. There is no Elton John on this CD."
3,alot of fun but work on the quality revell,"alot of fun but the quality overall with revell models is terrible, compared to tamiya, for example. you do pay alot less with revell but it is very much reflected in the product when you open the box. things like more flash, parts not mated with each other well, like the two piece hull of this battleship; the plastic was bowed and with a gap so wide i can slip two house keys pressed flat together into it. i also noticed the detail on the parts themselves are not as good compared to others. so just remember the old adage ""You get what you pay for"" when you consider revell and you wont be surprised or disappointed."
3,Revell USS Arizona Model kit,"I had recieved this model kit as a present for Christmas around 3 years ago, now I have a little time and I started to work on it. When I over the parts and instructions I noticed that the trees of parts weren't cast very well and some of the parts didn't line up well while putting it together. Most of the parts needed a lot of modification to make them even and to look good. At first I thoght that it might have been a bad batch but I had to order some replacement parts from Revell, and upon recieving them I noticed that they too were cast poorly so it wasn't just a bad batch. Over all this kit is good for a starting modeller that isn't looking to spend a ton of money on model, yes, you have to do a little work to make it look good but it was an ok model. I will say if you want a model ship that has a lot of quality look at Tamiya or another model company for a better quality model."
2,Not in good quality,"I bought this model few weeks ago and started to assemble as soon as I got it. The model broke into pieces when I opened the box...this means that you have to figure out which tiny pieces should go where by yourself, and might miss some parts. When you finally assemble your model and find that there is a missing part, that would be very annoying. The bottom parts of the ship hardly fit together, I used a lot of cement.I have some collection of models with different brand since I was a child. I can say that this one is really not worth money. Spend 10 or few more dollars and buy a better one like Trumpeter Model. I have a Trumpeter USS Yorktown and its so good. At the very least, the box is rigid, so that shipping won't damage your model. Also, they wrap the parts separately and carefully, and there is even a small box to put in model planes. If you are still confused, just buy them and find out the truth yourself."
2,Missing Parts,"When i got it i was going to start building it for my brother since he doesnt have the heart or time to build it him self so m building it and then when i get to the Bridge and Sea Cataplates, They were gone! I couldnt find the parts to that one and then i notice it didnt come with it so i dont think i would buy from this seller agian."
3,That Pet's Munch not Munchy Enough,"This is a great toy that I have no doubts my cockatiel will love once he gets used to it. It's dried vine all wound into a ball. I got one from That Pet Place when I placed an order from them of perches and toys for my new aviary (King's Cages). The problem: the one I received from That Pet had maybe half of the length of vine in the ball as the one pictured here.I haven't bought the version from Global Pets, but I sure hope that other balls have more to them. I paid 20% more for the That Pet one over the Global Pets and got half of what I was expecting.Great toy, but be prepared for a ball that doesn't have nearly the amount of vine in it as you see pictured."
3,Disappointed,"I read this book after hearing about it on Good Morning America. I must say that I am not a big mystery fan, but from time to time I will read one and usually do find them an interesting read. This was not the case with ""A Vineyard Killing."" There were ""twists and turns"" that left you wondering but the book just didn't ""grab"" my interest, but I did finish it just to see who the murderer was."
1,The killing in this vineyard...,"...ought to be this series. It's time that Mr. Craig ended what used to be a good series, but what has now degenerated into boring, thin mysteries. Then again...there's no mystery at all...he continues to write this series, he and the publisher make money...and the faithful readers get s------d!"
4,Another winner by Rembrandt Charms!,"Once again,Iam very satisfied with this one.Very fast delivery,arrived in good conition and it's really beautiful.What I really like about this seller is having the choise of various materials(gold,sterling silver etc),so you can choose what you can afford.A little bigger size would be great but you can't have everything!"
1,Save your money ... this book is not useful.,"I purchase about three marketing books each month on Amazon. If I get one good idea, the money is well spent. I have a degree in PR with a marketing minor. I have studied marketing for 20 years and have over 200 marketing books in my library.This books ... sucks. There is really no other way to say it.The assertions are not researched based, some of the ideas are taken from other books, and some of the ideas are out-dated."
3,not very good,"this was a waste basically,and I only paid 4 dollars and some change.Basically a bunch of jibberjab trying to get the listener to purchase other very expensive programs, seminars, etc that im convinced mustbe equally as stupid."
1,Do not waste your money or your time on this book or system,"Monopolize Your Marketplace is about as close to a scam as is possible without crossing the boundary. If I could give this book and system a zero rating, I would. This company has morphed into a variety of different guises over time, staying almost one step ahead of the law and/or bankruptcy. However, they were successfully prosecuted by the FCC and lost. They have filed for bankruptcy. Don't be fooled by the slick language in their ads. It is not effective."
2,Cheap toy - big on price,"If my son was not such a fan, I never would have purchased the items. Cheap plastic- part came off, big prices!"
3,Review of Intec PSone color monitor,"I am very dissatisfied with the quality of this color monitor. The first one had to be sent back due to pixels being burned out. Now I am trying to return the second color monitor because there isn't any power to the monitor. I'm not sure what the problem is with this monitor, but I'm hoping to try for the third time."
1,okkkkkkkkkk,"first of all, dont listen to the rateing because i dont have one of these but i just wanted to post here because i was just browsing the ps section and i saw 5 inch monitor 109.99 i thought cool then doo daa doo scroll down and i see 4 inch monitor 109.99 both made by intech inc and i thought what in the world????? why would you pay the same price for less? that confusses me but oh well bye (hint: get the 5 inch one i bet its better)"
4,good set,"there are Better overall sets but for the price you are getting some classic cuts from the Jackson 5 on here.Michael Jackson back in the day sounded Closer to Ottis Redding than a Kid.good arrangements,hooks&Background vocals make this all tight."
2,Does not fit,I'm sure this item is great and it looked like the perfect item I needed to make my existing Regalo gate work with stairway in my new house. Only problem is that the bolt part of the product is too big and does not fit on my gate. Would have been nice if the listing specified the bolt size. Now have to return and see if there is anything out there for the Regalo.
4,Great for our stairs,"We have a 1 year old and needed to put up gates. However, the bottom of our stairs has rails and we could not use a pressure mount gate that would hold up against a wall. The spindles were perfect to push the gate up against the rail. Keep know that you only get a set of two... meaning one for the top and one for the bottom for one side of the rail."
5,Worked great for my metal banister,"I have one of those pain in the butt stairs with a metal banister on one side that makes attaching a child gate very difficult. I bought these spindles with the kidco gate and they worked great for securing the gate at the bottom of the stairs. One caveat I would add is that I would not trust this at the top of my stairs, if that was the case I would have attached a board and secured the pressure cups."
3,caution,"These did work great so I wouldn't have to drill into my stairway, however, in order to have the pressure gate be secure enough the spindles seem to be a bit slanted now from all the pressure (which I guess can be fixed later)."
5,Love this piece of metal!,"I read all the reviews and was still skeptical. How could something so weird looking meet all these expectations? Well, it does! I have had 2 up for about 5 months now and they work great! I read the review that said its hard to give a piece of metal 5 stars & it's true. It does exactly what it says. The gate is very sturdy even when my 11 month old hangs on it & shakes it! I am very impressed with this product."
3,Does what it should,This is an effective spindle that get the job done. We had an awkward staircase and no gate was able to stay; but the spindle helped me get the gate fixed properly. I'l recommend to anyone having a awkward staircase.
5,Generac Portable Products 1276 30 Amp 6 Circuit Power Transf,Great product. Easy to install. If you look at the front side of the unit you will see the UL label. Get some reading glasses John from Florida.
3,Not quite ready...,"The content on the CD is great but I feel like this CD should have been one more studio album down the road.It does contain their best known radio tracks but they only have 8 singles I think and then it seems like they took one non-single from each album. I know they could have thrown some live recordings, b-sides or material off their first few indie releases to make the album fuller but I really just think that they needed to wait until after their next studio album to release this with 2-3 more quality tunes which we all expect & can count on from Fuel.Overall, it's a good CD especially for someone that is just a casual fan and enjoys the radio hits... they are all on here! For anyone that is an actual fan of the band, go buy the new Special Edition versions of their 3 studio albums for something more."
4,Good but get the Playlist Version...,"You get all these songs, plus the 2 good ones off of Angels & Devils, their song off the Godzilla soundtrack, plus another from the Hazelton EP. Save money and you get 14 rockers."
3,Pretty good for the most part,"The only Fuel song I knew was ""Hemmorage"" so I expected the rest of their material to be similar. Overall, I was a little disappointed. Sure, Fuel is a good band, just not quite the type of music I thought they were going to be. Since I don't know their material, I can't say whether these were the best songs to but on a ""best of"" album but the songs they did use are pretty good, for the most part."
4,I love Naranda,"Naranda is so pretty! I got her AT ONCE. She looks lovely on my shelf. Another very pleasing model from Breyer...one of sixteen+ models of mine. However, I would not used this as a play-toy. The tail is very bendy and fragile, and the horse balances on two feet and her tail, which makes her hard to stand up. Also, at least on my model, the paint was a little soft in one spot so she got a couple of noticeable surface scratches, so I displayed her with her good side up. This is a very beautiful model! Even the whites of her eyes are there!"
5,wonderful model,"This horse is a beautiful model.If you show your models, this one is photo and live show quaity. Her problem is, sometimes she falls down, but this shouldn't keep you from buying her.A MUST HAVE!"
5,Beautiful Saddlebred,"I just got Naranda. She is very beautiful and comes with a special photgraphic card about the real Naranda. The box has a silver-and-red seal with a date and name, so save the box!This is a very beautiful, sturdy horse. The only problem is that she stands on two feet and has to balance on her tail, so she sometimes falls down. I don't reccomend this for young kids as the tail is bendy too. Try Breyer ponies, made specifically for kids!"
2,Well-made but Ineffective,"I ordered a few pairs to try. I have size 10.5 feet, which makes me about average. My feet are flat, hence the need for orthotics.I tried these in several shoes and sneakers, and thought they might reduce foot pain when I am on my feet alot. It turns out that I had much more pain than before. I really thought that these would be great for me, since they are nicely made and very supportive for the price, but no such luck. They will fill up more space in your shoes than the somewhat comparableProfoot Care Miracle Men's, Blue, 2-Ounces Units (Pack of 3). My experience was better with Profoot, so I may try other varieties of that brand.Despite my low rating, I would suggest trying one pair of Dr. Scholl's for a few days. They aren't too pricey and they may work well for you. I can only comment that it was a poor experience for me."
4,Pretty good insoles,"These insoles are of good quality and they seems comfortable. They move a little around while taking the foot out of the shoes so that's a bit annoying sometimes. I am not 100% sure yet they solved my pain problem, but they seems to be helping. I will consider buying some more. These are good insoles."
1,No arch support,"They're advertised as providing a ""flexible"" arch that provides ""customized support"". There's no customization - the arch support is floppy and provides virtually no support."
3,Not what I expected,"I have high arches and needed insoles for my converse sneakers. After a day of walking in New York City, my feet were really sore especially my arches. I quickly went into a drug store and bought the product I should've bought originally, the Dr. Scholes arch inserts. I now use these inside my Puma Mostro sneakers, which are snugger than my Converse shoes, and they seem to work better. So it seems like these work best on snug shoes."
1,YAWN!!!!!!!!,"I HATED this book, it is really awful! I expected lots more exitement! this is sutch a cheezy story, too. I wouldn't recommend it anywhere!!!!!"
3,This book was not as good as I hoped it would be!,"Remember Me To Harold Square looked like it would bring back memories of New York City for me. I have been there many times. But, it didn't capture what New York City was really like. It also wasn't as funny as the description on the back of the book promised. I would recommend it to 5th and 6th graders, but not older readers."
4,Nice Native American Barbie,"This was a nice Native American Barbie Doll, and it came fairly quickly. She enjoyed it, and then switched outfits with other Barbies she has."
4,Ella's Christmas 2011,"The native American Barbie was for our four year old neice Ella. Her older brother had received a Navajo Code Talker GI Joe the Christmas before. Being of Native American ancestory, I have made it a point to give gifts to teach the young ones of a almost forgotten way of life and lifes."
4,It keeps my head and feet moving.,"I'm a pretty big studio Phish fan, and the return of horns is very welcome and add a great layer to Trey's deep guitar. The album is short though, and it nearly dies in the middle (mr. completely?). Yes, Ray Dawn Balloon is better than Radon Balloon. If you're going to download one song, make it the ""hit"", Alive Again. If you download two, make it Alive Again and At The Gazebo."
4,Trey's debut; tastedul but lacks the energy of colaboration,"A bit after Phish's boooming popularity with Farmhouse Trey releases his solo CD that proves that he can still write. He combines improv with studio work to make for some great listening. Phish influences are of course heard in his guitar playing but all the other instruments with new heads and hands give the music a new touch.Overall the evergy of either Phish or Oysterhead is sort of missing. With an 8+ piece band with one main leader it seems much harder to create a solid energy. Not to say this isn't full of great music, and speaking of which there are only 2 or 3 real downfalls to this album. 1 there is some signs of sloppy guitar playing, 2 his attempt at reggea is well... an attempt and 3 he reused Raydon Balloon from Oysterhead and titled it Ray Dawn Balloon.Nonetheless BUY THIS ALBUM! Its an album to all music fans.CAH (sorry if this posted twice)"
5,Brass & Guitar Heaven!,"I did not much of expectations listening to this CD for the first time. Phish is a good band live, their studio stuff is decent. With his new ""orchestra"" he is able to bring the music to a funkier, more rythmic level than with Phish. He jabs his guitar solos in and out of the song structure instead of being the main focus. Songs like ""Push on till the Day"" make you shake your head in amazement with the level of groove that it achieves. The best part of repeat listenings is capturing the different levels of tonality offered. Trey knows how to pick 'em when it comes to players to jam with. These ""backup"" players and singers are top notched, so don't consider this a solo album by Trey Anastasio. This is a big band that rocks!"
4,Vermont Representation,"This is quite a groovy record... It strikes me as having the timeless perspective of Abbey Road with a very different sound. For a solo record from a guitar platyer there is suprisingly little in the way of guitar pyrotechnics. This is a record about musical ideas and arrangements, not about getting away with things that didn't interest other band members. Trey's ever enlarging solo band is playing music that a quartet could never articulately voice. I'm fond of the extreme sounds of the album loving the soft, meoldic numbers like Flock of Words, and Ether Sunday as well as the power rockers like Mr. Completely. The well orchestrated cut of At the Gazebo is also quite inspiring.Most of the songs on the record are your standard length, except for Last Tube and Push on Til the day. Tere's a spot in the push on til the day jam that looses me... but less so with each listen. The 11 minutes or so of Last Tube are great, with some really interesting horn action."
1,Derivative not eclectic,Trey's guitar playing is phenomenal he is a true master of his craft to the fullest extreme of ability he weaves sonic landscapes like tapestries in the kingdom of virtuosic mysticism.He is almost as good as john petrucci.
4,My daughter and her dolls,My 8 year old daughter loves this Pixie doll. I'd have to say that I don't really like the Bratz dolls in general - too much make-up and too ditzy. The Pixie is better than most since it is a fantasy character. We got the Pixie DVD and the story line is better than most other Bratz shows. Too bad Barbie got rid of Wee 3 dolls.
3,Actually my favorite version....BUT.....,"This is without a doubt my favorite version.The three star rating is for every streaming source I've come across. Do yourself a favor and BUY THE DVD. Don't watch it via streaming or you're getting some badly butchured material. I have that butchured version on VHS and I enjoyed it ohsomuch until I rented the DVD one day and saw how complete it really was unedited.Streaming only offers the butchured version. You are missing far too much of the movie this way; huge chunks, hours, are not available. Please rent the DVD and watch the most faithful rendition of Francis Burnett's classic come to life!"
3,OK,I think I would prefer to watch a different movie as this was not the best made movie. I prefer old disney movies.
2,"Eh, it was ok","This version of The Secret Garden was, at best, just ok.The movie flowed too quickly from key scene to key scene. There was no sense of the time that it took for Mary to lose the worst of her contrary disposition or for Colin to become well. No development whatsoever, just boom! Mary's nice. Boom! Daddy's home and Colin's walking. It wouldn't have taken that much extra for the director to show the passage of time.I felt I was watching a recitation of lines...was I supposed to believe that Archibald Craven was mourning his wife? The actor didn't convey it. He seemed rather fatherly for a man who was mourning his wife, ignoring his son, and who previously had not wanted to see his niece. Was I supposed to believe that Colin was sick or that he thought he was dying? It would have been nice if the actors could have conveyed feeling and depth instead of such perfunctory recitation. They might as well have been reading from the script."
4,Question on this version,just a question - is this the version that ends with mary and Colin as adults?
1,Really?,"I ended up renting this because it was on Amazon's critics picks…If there was less than a star rating it would have gotten it! I had to give up after 20 mins.Terrible acting, terrible photography, terrible audio, … WTF?I mean, if you want to waste time that's the way to go"
3,Advance Golf,"As a frequent traveler, I've been a big fan of gameboy golf. I just got the Advance Console and bought the 2001 ESPN Golf Advance. The graphics are pretty good but it's very easy for anyone who has played other golf games (Example: I got a 12 under on 1st time playing). (...) I have played the Mario Golf for Gameboy color for about a year and find that to be much more challanging."
3,Could be Better,Recieved the game today. Was expecting to get a great game. The grafics are good but the on screen golf swing looks like something out of an 80s golf game. I'm sure it will pass the time but I'm not as enthusiastic about it.
5,Awesome talent,"I became familiar with Manfredo Fest first through some Concord sampler CDs, then I purchased four of his CDs and enjoy them a good deal. When I saw this concert DVD on Netflix I ordered it immediately. At first I was a bit let down by the simple staging and the short length of the program (about 8-9 pieces). But, after going through the program once, I had to hear certain songs again, and again, and again. I had never seen either Manfredo or Brain Torff on film or in person. Manfredo's playing is simply top notch and very musical. He jazzes it up while still respecting whatever song he is playing. As for Brain Torff, I can truthful say I have never seen such a talented bassist who used such a variety of techniques. He was the equal of Manfredo, and the two meshed perfectly on all the numbers included. My favorite was Wave by Jobim, and Manfredo of course can play Jobim extremely well. If you like great jazz piano and bass, this is the program for you."
1,Terrible Scan of Original - do not purchase!,"The original ""life and customs..."" book is a wonderful text - that is not the issue. Despite the disclaimer warning that this is a optical scan (and particularly given the $21 price), buyer beware - this text is so full of typos that it is unreadable. Occasional typos would be acceptable, but this text is riddled with random numbers, symbols, non-words to the degree that much of it is unintelligible. I urge the reader to look for a different version - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK, or you'll be returning it as I am.Frankly, I'm highly disappointed in Amazon's quality control on this one..."
3,Hoped for more Easter Island,"Amazing story of a strong woman who battled mental illness for most of her life and didn't let it slow her down. She followed her dream to Easter Island. I do wish there was more about her time on Easter Island, what she felt not just what she worked on, but still a great story."
4,"Well put together, informative","Received the book yesterday and can't put it down. I consider myself an intermediate turner and some of the projects are a little above me, some right on. There are some very interesting shapes that I would enjoy trying. I like the book and would recommend it to other woodturners. It is well above the beginner. I am delighted to add this woodturning book to my library."
5,Excellent from start to finish,This is a fabulous read! I have read it at least ten times and it never fails to keep me spellbound. Laura Black is truly a lost treasure and it is a shame that she is out of print.
2,DISSAPOINTED,NOT AS GOOD AS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.. THE STORY DRAGS ON AND YOU BECOME BORED IN THE MIDDLE. THEN IT BECOMES VERY PREDICTABLE.
2,to much of everything come tonothing,"it was not what i expected, the buyer told me to change my review because it was a bad review, i erased it, but is a copy of a copy and there are not too many pictures and there is not much content"
2,Recording does not work for her,"Because she is a far better actress and performer than singer, this recording is not satisfying in itself. Her vocal range is limited. I would say the same, though not as pronounced a dichotomy, about Mary Cleere Haran. An interesting contrast is Amanda McBroom, whose presence is even stronger than her voice yet her CD's really work because there is more than enough that comes through."
4,Bella!,This series has been one of my favorites. I was not so excited about Summer in Rome when I saw the pictures from the Toy Fair. But she is really exquisite in real life. I'm glad they got rid of the hat and went with the scarf. I think that it's very Sophia Lorenish.
2,Didnt work 4 me,"The bottom lock nut did not work for me. I cranked it tight and as hard as I could and I was still able to turn the nut fairly easily(also loosend while playing). Also the arm is not easy to trip while playing,its very distracting. Switched to the DW Clutch and life is perfect. The lock nut just worked and the arm takes no concentration or focus to trip."
4,He'll bring a smile to your face,this is cute for all ages. My 18 mo old son cherishes this Pooh and drags him everywhere. My elderly patients love to exercise with this Pooh too. He adds a smile wherever he goes!
3,Balkin war memoir.,"memoir by a veteran of the spanish american war who volunteers his service to the greek forces to help free europe from turkish rule.he starts to join the garrabaldi legion, but by circumstance joins the regular greek forces...ends up seeing action during the seige of bizane and is wounded.there is not much written on the balkan wars, as was overshadowed by ww1."
3,Better than most bands out there,"Ignore the other review. His comments say enough to kno not to trust his opinion.This is a pretty good debut from Canada's Daydream Nation. Kind of blissed-out, spacey rock a la Spiritualized, My Bloody Valentine, Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Warlocks, etc.Cheaper at the label's website though. I got it new for $7."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS...,I went for ages hating Sonic Youth because I thought this was their album!! Don't make the same mistake!!
3,BEWARE!! Bought Two Sets Different Shades,"Beautiful plates with just a few flaws. However, I bought two sets and got two different shades per set. The lighter plates were the Churchhill as advertised the others were a brand called Queens, which is a division of Churchhill--these plates were darker."
4,Love it,I got these when they were $13.99 amazon dropped the price to $7.99 they adjusted the price which made it a awsome deal. Not too formal but nice for family Christmas dinner
3,"Ernie Watts is a great tenor man, but.......","This is a great concert for fans of the more modern soundof jazz. I personally am more a fan of the straight aheadmode. This concert is very good, and one can hear Ernie'smasterful delivery, especially on Skylark. But electrickeyboards, and electric basses are not my cup of tea.What I would like to see, is Ernie's performance on hiswork with Charlie Hayden's Quartet West material, it isreally great. Don't get me wrong, this is a masterfulset, these guys are all great, I am just an acoustic-aholic."
4,midnightglory,"midnightglory my black mustang stallion looks similar to this model.midnightglory holds his tail the same way!midnightglory thinks my aunt's 341 horses are his herd!he bullies them around.because he's so big,animals and people fear him!he is a blue eyed kiger mustang and andulisan mix!he has the symbol of a long bodyed dragon holding a star on his fore head!this model gets borning really quick!his value is worth 12 dollars!his overall is 4 because he come with a book!"
4,A must-have for fans of the Warlock series...,"Okay, it must be understood that this is part of an ongoing series and as such has alot of back story holding it up. This book is the continuing story of the Gallowglass family that has it's origins in the book ""Escape Velocity"" and actually starts in ""The Warlock In Spite Of Himself"". This is the story of Gregory Gallowglass, the youngest of Rod & Gwen's four chuldren, and his first steps towards independance. This story also tracks the witch Finister who has been the nemesis of the Gallowglass children for five books now. The story begins where ""Quicksilver's Knight"" left off, with Gregory escorting the witch Finister to the Royal Coven. Stasheff, as always, recaps events from the previous books to fill in any reader who might not be reading the entire series. The story is a fun read, an excellent example of science-fantasy, where ESPers are seen as witches & warlocks and an entire future colony has gone SCA, for real."
2,a bit disappointing.,"This is my least favorite book in the entire series, mostly because I feel like it took away everything that made Gregory so interesting in the previous book. In Quicksilver's Knight, he was an interesting outlier in his family-- the slim, pale scholar who had no interest in warfare (other than strategic/intellectual) and whose magic was powerful enough that he was nevertheless able to protect himself.In this book, he decides that he needs to have muscles if he's ever going to find love, and his mother helps him use magic to make him look exactly like every other male character in the series. Really? Gross.(There's also the whole issue of him falling for the woman who essentially raped his brother, but you can't really think too carefully about sexual ethics if you want to read much Stasheff.)"
4,Tail-Wagging Coffee Table Book!,"This book is sort of a ""coffee table"" fun book -- pictures and quotable quotes, not a lot of data -- but it's fun and certainly a must-have for dog lovers. This is an ideal gift book.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,One of the best novels of our century,"Have read it first, 25 years ago (first Hebrew translation, titled: ""The Satan in Moscow"")Must have read it another 25 times since, and every time I enjoy it more and find new sides and aspects in it. A MUST book."
2,Interesting.,"I struggled with trying to find a title for my review. Although not the first book I read for Bulgakov, could be classified as the last. An amazingly skilled writer who got lost in what he was trying to say. A great book that could have been, unfortunately wasn't because of a confused plot. Very much like a Chagal painting that has too many focal points and still does not draw attention.It seems bulgakov had strained himself in trying to be strange that the story seemed very forced and the excessive detail had somewhat transformed into a long nightmare."
4,Surrealist Adventure,"I went into this novel knowing next to nothing about Russian or Soviet culture, but as it is often cited as one of the most important books to come out of Russia, I decided to give it a whirl. I was surprised by how fun the story was, how slick and cool the characters are. It was definitely tough to dive into - The first few chapters are disjointed and packed with confusing details - but it is worth working through. The details come together to produce a fantastical story that left my thoughts returning to the characters again and again. I cannot say much about the accuracy of the translation, but in terms of reading quality, it was very smooth and natural sounding, which is hard to find in translated stories."
3,Harry Potter meets Franz Kafka,"This book was so convoluted, I could never get into it. All the allegorical stuff going on. I think if it were in context, like read in conjuction with Russian History, with someone explaining the references to Christianity and all the other interwoven tales, it might have made more sense. I'm sure it is very cleverly written, and a significant piece of work, but I didn't enjoy reading it much."
4,Sci-Fi before it was called that...,"a friend of mine reccomended this book to me when i was living in maine...and i read it out of curiosity...bulgakov takes on religion, atheism, the arts, dilletantes, and puts them all on shish-kebob...to me the romance between the novelist and his woman, was the loveliest part of the book. of course, if you like biting sarcasm and satire, you will treasure this also; approach this book with an open mind, and get a good translation..."
4,Well blended Sabre/Fury History,"This book presents an outstanding history of the Sabre/Fury family of airplanes, with techical, historical and operational information blended well into a complete history. To be fully complete, however, I would add drawings or pictures of the original straight wing prototype (rare, but they do exist)... My only other comment is that I would like to see a larger color photo section for the price of the book."
5,Works Great and Easy to setup,I have an original garage door opener from the 1980s that is still going strong. Unfortunately the one remote I have for it is falling apart. I ordered this one not sure if it would work. I was happily surprised that it only took me a few minutes to match up the dip switches to the original remote and works great! I am ordering another one for a backup.
1,There a lot of better options out there,"I have used this for less than a year and I think I threw my money away. Batteries last 45 minutes tops right now. It has locked on me countless times, so while driving, I have to manage to remove the batteries, place them again and wait for the library to show up (this can take as long as 3 minutes!). File transfer is slow (no surprise, its USB) and lately I have been transferring 200 songs only to have it display 32, and there is nothing wrong with these songs. I am very dissatisfied with this product, hopefully this review will help someone in not buying this overpriced worthless mp3 player from here."
1,Nomad Jukebox Poor Choice,Nomad Jikebox has plenty of memory (I have the 20GB version) for a stack of music. Problem is that the supporting software is poor and the sound is difficult to hear during say a plane trip. The open ear phones do NOT provide adequate sound and even on Max volume it was difficult to hear quite passages. I tried to query Creative Labs about these problems but I got no response. Too bad because the Nomad Jukebox is a great idea but teir execution is very poor!
1,Simply awful,"Like many people, I resent shelling out my hard earned money for something which it seems has been designed to be a disposable commodity like an old video cassette tape, which this product clearly has.Creative have produced an apparently amazing concept without listening to the customer...hmmm, now there's a surprise, another corporation ripping off people with products with short shelf-lives, built no doubt by cheap foreign labour and sold at staggeringly high profits. Sound familiar? Just look around...This product was ok to begin with, but performance tailed off quickly as soon as the warranty expired...coincidence? You decide.Creative have seen the last of my money, and I hope others arent as easily conned into buying the latest must-have gizmo like I unfortunately was. My advice? Go with the Ipod, and lets see Creative try being creative with their accounts as their profits disintegrate like one of their poorly assembled products. The revolution starts here!"
2,its alright,"I just got this product about 2 weeks ago and i dont like it. I wanted the ipod really bad but it was too exspensive so i went with a cheap one. First of all the sound quality is great, and that is probably is the only thing i like about it. The reason this is a piece of ... is that the software it comes with is ...up and .... First of all to get your songs u hav to get them through a CD. I have windows media player and i have yet to find a way to convert my songs from that over to creative play center. That really .... Second the battery life is .... It only stores up to 4 measly hours, and half the time it isnt even 4. Its for you to decide but i wouldnt go with this piece of ... they give you."
1,Four Months and Done,I recieved the Jukebox as a gift and at first thought it was great. My only complaint was that it was'nt loud enough and the file transfer was a little complicated. But just when I mastered the applications it went into critical error and would power off right after powering on. I only had it four months when this happened and when I inquired about the warranty I was told that it only had a three month warranty. The unit was never abused in any way. I will never buy or recommend anyone else to Creative products. If you read the other negative reviews you will find similar warranty issues and product failures.
3,Not bad,"For what it is (an alternative to the ipod, for those of us who don't have 400+ bucks to spend) it's not bad. It plays the music just fine, plenty of volume, lots of memory. Transfer rate from hard drive to the player is very fast, and you can que up all the files at once so all you have to do is wait a few minutes. Transfer from CDs is a little slower and I had some problems with it not transfering all the songs.On the negative side, navigating around can be very tedious and it's fairly easy to clear your playlist on accident. Battery life [is bad], ... The charger has no indicator lights so you don't really know if your batteries are actually charging or not.Considering the relatively low price tag and the large amounts of space this is a pretty good buy, as long as you can stand some minor annoyances."
3,Creative Labs 10GB Nomad Jukebox,"It's really nice to carry a lot of songs, but is difficult to navigate and slow. Since it has a hard drive it can skip, but not as easily as a cd player. sound is good. It also has re-chargable batteries (yay for the environment) but you can only use creative's brand of rechargable batteries (something i didn't know until i bought it)."
4,Wonderful Player,"I received this player as a present and was very impressed with the sound quality and ease of use. I was not in the market for an mp3 player when I got it and had no idea of the sound quality you could achieve with it. It has a massive amount of memory on it and it works great with the software provided as well as Musicmatch Jukebox. The only reason I give this a four star rating (it really should be four and a half) is because of the battery problems I have encountered, it won't recharge the batteries it came with. I recently gave up on the batteries and just use it plugged in with a car adapter or the home charging jack. I use it with a tape adapter in the car and it rocks. Overall, a great buy and well worth the money."
4,"Love it, but the User Interface is not intuitive","This is a great product; I have had this item for almost two years and enjoy it tremendously. However, the user interface is not intuitive and I would recommend a totally different interface. If you like to fiddle with gadgets and spend time figuring out what button does what, you'll love it too!"
2,"Poor software, broke quickly","I found the ripping software needlessly confusing and with poor instructions. Still, we put a dozen CDs on it and used it for a few hours. We forgot about it for a few months. Today I went to add more CDs and, after the first two additions, the unit stopped working. ... I am disappointed and would not buy from this company again."
3,Good Read,This book was a fast read and well put together which is ideal for high school students. The down side to this text was that it did leave out some important aspects to the philosophy as a sacrifice to the 60 pages.
5,Super Book...I'm Still Shocked!,"This book is far better than the normal Matt Christopher offering, probably because Christopher is dead and Glenn Stout, the writer, did an excellent job.The book traces Schilling from an infant to his triumphant outing in the 2004 World Series. It details his growth from a blue-haired multi-earring jerk into a responsible, charity-giving superstar. The candidness of the book was surprising in that it's a biography for children, and it makes the book very interesting.I recommend this highly, for grown-ups and children. Especially anyone that hates the Yankees!"
4,Exciting !,"At first I thought...""My god, when does the story start ?"". It takes quite a while until the story gets in motion but you won't be disappointed ! It's a very exciting movie (mini-series - whatever) and you can't get your eyes off the screen. Donna Mills gives a great performance and she looks GREAT !"
2,Oh my.,This is pretty bad. If you thing that Katharine's mother is anything like the American Idol contestant you are wrong. Every song starts off the same with the same piano notes. ECH!!
1,um...............o.............kay.....,"dude.......this flat out sucks..........it's a mixture of wannabe operatic vocals and really bad music. I mean, what's up with the piano being the same every single song! COME ON!!! Anyways, it's obvious where Katharine got her great singing talent.......oh wait......no...it's not....wait...Katharine has talent? Whoa."
2,About what I expected.,"I listened to this out of pure curiosity. Ms. McPhee definitely delivered what I expected her album to be. It's not my style preference, but I don't hold that against her at all. I was more curious about her vocal ability since she took it upon herself to outline her daughters life for her and make her into a star. As long as you know what you're getting into with this type of album, you will probably like it. I didn't- but my expectations weren't too high, either."
2,COULD'VE BEEN WORSE,"THREE BOUNTY HUNTERS [LEAD BY DAVID HASSELHOFF, IN A PRE-BAYWATCH ROLE] ATTEMPT TO RESCUE A KIDNAPPED WOMAN [LINDA BLAIR]. A FEW FUNNY MOMENTS AND SOME OK ACTION SCENES SAVE THIS FROM BEING A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. I ONLY PAID $1 FOR THIS MOVIE AT A DOLLAR STORE AND JUDGING FROM WHAT I SAW, I PRETTY MUCH GOT WHAT I PAID FOR. CHECK IT OUT IF YOU WANT, BUT DON'T EXPECT MUCH."
3,Thermostatic fan fail,This device is supposed to have a thermostatically controlled fan however my unit will run continuously no matter what. The fan is just always on unless I turn the switch to off. I am not very happy about this at all. The heat it throws it pretty good. It doesn't feel very hot coming out of the unit (just a lil warm) but after a few hours there is a drastic difference in the temperature of my basement.
4,"Good heat, noisy fan","We installed out Magic Heat a few weeks ago. It does reclaim a lot of heat and blows it into room. 5 stars for that. BUT it is super noisy. Our living room is not that big and you practically have to yell to be heard over it. Turn the tv up and it's fine. We have gotten used to the noise but there is no denying it is super loud. It is also a lot larger that we thought. Wood stove is our only heat, so this really makes a temp. difference to us, just wish the fan wasn't so noisy."
2,heat exchanger consequences,"let me start out first be stating this is a well built productand i have no complaint with the quality and it performed perfectlyand blows a large amount of heated air into the room.....but what it causes needs to be thought aboutthe blower takes so much heat out of the pipe above it that your vent pipe above itgets very dirty.in my case enough to completely clog my top screen at the end of the vent above the rooflet me also state that before installing it my vent pipe was always very cleaneven after multiple years of use.i always run a good hot fire that burns cleanyou also cannot close your dampner down "" to make your wood last longer "" after youinstall the heat exchanger, you must run it wide open all the time, and it stillruns very dirty......so much so that i removed it..."
1,don't waste you $$$$,"This dvd set was a total waste of time and $$$-wish I had read reviews before buying it at Barnes and Noble. It is just like any other pilates dvd, there are NO modifications for 2nd or 3rd trimester- you are flat of your back for a good 15 minutes! It is common knowledge that women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters should not be flat of their backs. I have 3 other pilates dvd's that I used before prgnency, I purchased this one b/c I wanted to be safe and have the benefits of pilates w/ pregnancy modifications. I was very disappointed. I tried to do some of it-but just got irritated- I also had some pains in my lower abdomin and when I got up off my back I was extremely light headed. I wouldn't recommend this for a pregnant women in any stage of their pregnancy."
2,Intellectual Redundancy,"When an author clearly aspires to be looked upon by the public eye as an ""intellectual"" and seeks to impress others with his extreem wordiness, redundancy of expressions and use of technical terms, he writes not for the benefit of all who will read his work but he writes to benefit his ""intellectual"" ego. Other than this obvious impression, the work is adequate enough for the subject.I was able to purchase this book for just over $5.00 and am not sure I paid too much."
3,Rebus Review,"I actually bought this for my son who is 7 and although, with my assistance, it is fun for him, the titles (answers) were not as fun since they were titles that he was not familiar with."
5,Model 94,This book was just as described. I'm very satisfied with it. Well written the model '94 is a classic rifle/carbine & this book is a classic. Excellent honest vendor.
2,Bigger than they appear.,"I got this item for my second hole in my ears. By the description and picture I expected it to be smaller. I cannot wear them in my second hole, they are too large and their backing is to large.I do however think that they are very cute and plan on passing them on to someone who will use the studs in their 1st hole."
3,Charmed book,"The preview indicated minature, however, I was a bit disappointed it WAS SO small. Still...no complaint on book otherwise."
3,nice,this was a nice little spell book to have. but beware of the size because it is a small one but if you are a fan if the show then you should get it.
1,Lost American Idol over this.,This item doesn't work very well but doubles as the following:1. Non-working Light Saber2. Non-working Police Baton3. Non-working flashlight4. Non-working microphone
2,Misled by Apple,"Audio technology is not my forte, so I figured this microphone with its miniplug would work with my MacBookPro. Apple advertises it prominently on its website and has been skewered by customers who found that it does not work without being first plugged into a mixer or device such as iMic.I did a lot of on-line research and still missed the mark. So now I am wondering what I can use it for -- it doesn't seem to work plugged into my camcorder, Dell laptop, stereo receiver, or PC either. I don't do karoake."
4,Vocals galore and a good acoustic guitar mic,"This dynamic microphone is very good for its value. It came with a tripod desk stand which is perfect for singing and playing acoustic guitar at my computer. Great sound even though it is a bit quiet. This product comes with a cable with a female XLR going into the mic and a 1/8"" end. You can plug the 1/4"" adapter included with to extend the possibilities.I had to go to the local music shop to pick up an male XLR adapter to plug this into my Line 6 Toneport UX2. Now I can record vocals and mic my acoustic instruments with a more professional sound than the $10 computer microphone I was using before. Woo hoo! :-)Wonderful value. This package loses a point for recording really quiet and not including a male XLR plug. Overall, a great buy. This is definitely a ""Shure"" bet. (pun intended)"
4,Great microphone. not so good for computer,"I used this microphone for my DVD player, the effect is great. However, when connected with computer, the sound is a little too low."
3,Heavy Toy,Pooh is very cute - but beware! He is also very heavy and hard. We have 2 kids in the house (3 years and 9 months old) The older one dropped pooh and it hit the younger baby - gave him a nice bruise. Very cute - if you plan to leave pooh in the corner. Not to be used as a stuffed animal and absolutely can't sleep with him in the child's bed.
4,Great TV,"TV is working great, Picture quality is excellent. Only problem we had was the supplier charged for expedited shipping, and the unit was delivered in 10 days. Yes the tv weights 200lbs, but the supplier knows this and if they are unable to deliver expedited, that shouldn't be an option and the customer should never be charged."
3,Clear Faceshield,"Considering the price and not being able to see the product up close, I got what I paid for. If I were in a retail store and had a better selection I would not have purchased this one. It works but the faceshield clips don't hold the shield in place all the time, it needs attention now and again."
1,wrong set you sent constrution set,the set was marked wrong it said farmset on the glued on tag. I didn't feel like going threw the motions of sending it back so I kept it I will no longer order toys on line its not worth the hassle
1,"Bratty, not sassy","These books feature a borderline infantile, whiny, nasty child. When I read Junie B. Jones to my child I felt the need to leave out many of the words and sentiments such as the frequent ""I hate"" and ""stupid."" I will be relieved after I donate these books to the public library. Placing them into the recycle bin is a strong temptation."
1,And we wonder why kids have no respect?,"Amen to all the folks who have written to say they dislike these books! I bought them for my daughter because her best friend next door was reading them, and I was appalled at Junie B's language and her disrespect for everyone, especially the adults and her teacher. How are we to teach children proper respectful launguage and behavior if books like these get such high ratings? Do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THESE BOOKS!"
2,Not always appropriate,"I completely agree with DTG's review. My 1st grade daughter thinks the stories are funny, but I am constantly skipping a word that's not appropriate (i.e. hate, darn, stupid, dumb) and having to explain why these aren't appropriate. Her teacher also reads these stories in class. I can understand being able to relate to a character their age, but Junie portrays most of the behaviors I try get my six year old to avoid. I am now looking for better role models for my daughter to be reading about."
1,Terrible language,I think these books are terrible for young children. The language was so negative and inappropriate.
1,A theme is forming here - the true booklovers hate Junie B..,"but it seems like the parents who want their kids to just shut up adore her. Car rides where everyone was silent?! I could keep my kid quiet too by letting her cram chocolate down her throat for a 9 hour car ride. But is it good for her? NO! Just like Junie B. Jones isn't.With so much fun and interesting literature available - even educational (!) - why waste their time? Teach the children to discern good literature for themselves. Cracking up over Junie B. with them just reinforces her hold. If you HAVE to read it, then do it once (aloud and together) and then trash the book. Talk about how it isn't worth their time, they'd never hang out with Junie B. in real life so why waste time with her now?Spend you dollars elsewhere. You'll be glad you did!"
1,Beware of these books,"If you want your child to acquire misspelling, a warped grammar and bad habits, then go ahead and buy these books. Written by an author who obviously has not mastered correct English language you will be able to counteract all your kids' teacher's efforts. Have fun."
1,Very disappointed!,"I purchased this box set to read with my 6 year old daughter. We started with the first book and I was absolutely appalled. I expected her to get in trouble, but I don't see the humor in a little girl being rude to her friends. I am trying to teach my daughter to be caring and respectful. These books are full of words like ""stupid"", ""dumb"", ""the boy I hate"" and ""the boy I can beat up"". Not the kind of role model I want for my kindergartener. Maybe we'll bring these out again when she is older and can understand that it is not the proper way to behave, but for now, they are off our bookshelf."
5,"The grammar is part of the fun, people!","My daughter absolutely adores these books, and she understands that the poor grammar is just part of the joke. We read the books together, or else she reads them to herself, giggling all the way, and then I snatch them away from her so I can have a turn! Parts of these books are downright hilarious, and parents who are reading them aloud, ""correcting"" the grammar are doing their children a disservice. Lighten up!"
5,Big hit!,For those who like the Junie B. Jones books this makes a great gift. Both girls in the family loved them.
3,Very thin.,"Tiny books, paperback. These books won't last, they're printed on manilla paper. I don't know about the content, I bought this as a gift."
4,Great gift for a little girl!,"I'd never heard of these, but my sister loves them! She asked for a Junie B. Jones book and this was a great deal for 4 books!"
5,Junie B Jones,This was a gift for the 1st grade grandaughter. My oldest grandaughter loved the series and read as many as she could.
5,Enthusiasm Plus!!!,"Thanks to these stories, my eight year old has suddenly developed an enthusiasm for reading. She has been a reluctant reader up until this series came into our lives. She's a counter --- counting the pages, the chapters, how many minutes she's been reading, how much more she has to read. She's a bargainer --- Trying to get out of reading more than one chapter, agreeing to read one page for my two. But finally, thanks to Junie B, she is getting caught up in the story and can't wait to read the next one. She can no longer wait for me to sit down with her and has started reading them on her own! This has been a fantastic summer for both of us, as she has finally discovered that reading can be a lot of fun. She is also happy that Barbara Park is ""still alive"" and hopes to read every single Junie B. book there is. She's read six of them so far -- three just this week alone!"
1,Check these out before you buy...,"I highly recommend you check one of these books out at the library before buying them. You either love these or you hate them. I'm in the hate category. I also recommend you read one yourself before reading it to your child. That way, if you hate them, your child isn't already hooked. And your child probably will get hooked, because these books are hilarious. The problem is that the grammar is atrocious and Junie's behavior is just not something you'd want your child to emulate. Then again, if you're looking for a good example of how NOT to behave these are the books for you. Some say that this is normal kindergarten grammer, but I strongly disagree. My child does not speak that way and neither do his friends."
1,Great Book For Teaching Horrible Manners,"Awful, rude, bad. Junie B yells at her parents and behaves badly. It's supposed to be cute.I read half a book and my 7 year old was embaraased by the rude language and manners. I started skipping over the ""bad parts"" then just skipped the whole thing. Chapter names like ""The Dumb babies room"" etc...Good Book if you want your kid to be rude and obnoxious.Not for me."
1,Not for small children,"My 2nd grader ( who is just learning grammer in school ) came out after reading the first chapter and pointed out several obvious grammer mistakes. She found the horrible grammer very distracting and put the books aside to show her teacher. I am very proud ( but shocked )that my 8 year old has better grammer skills than the author seems to. These books are marketed to kids from 1st to 3rd grade who are just beginning to learn about sentence structure and the proper use of English, yet these books have broken the most basic rules. There are so many wonderful books out there for kids her age I have no problem with putting this book in the trash !"
1,Worst Childrens' book I've ever read,"It's a crying shame that in the interest of getting kids excited to read we think we have supply them with this drivel. What is the point of getting kids to read if they don't get anything worthwhile from the books they're reading? I'd frankly rather have my daughter watching the childrens' programming on TV than learning about ""the dumb old baby"" that Junie B's mother ""bringed"" home from the Hospital. I realize that the infantile prose is deliberate, but it's also not any fun to read. Moreover, every page Junie B. is calling something or someone dumb or stupid. Kids can relate to this? Whose kids!!? The library is full of books with whimsical, imaginative, and artfully written and illustrated stories. Why bother with this garbage?"
1,horrible grammar -- bad example for new readers,"Why on earth a writer would promote bad grammar is beyond my comprehension. In fact, Junie B speaks worse than almost all first graders that I know so it is not even accurate. I had been fixing the grammar as I read the books to my girls but now that my oldest daughter can read she continuously says ""that is not what the books says...""The story lines are cute and fun but I will not read these to my kids anymore nor will I ever buy another Junie B book until Barbara Parks gets a clue and cleans up the grammar in the books."
2,Not a fan.....,"I have a 7 yr old girl that has been trying to read Junie B. books for over a year. The stories are okay, but the incorrect grammar is almost unbearable. It confuses my daughter so much she has to stop reading and ask for an explanation. We will not be getting any more of these books!"
1,Thumbs DOWN!!!!!,"These books are the worst! If I could give it zero or minus 5 I would. As a teacher and mother of 5 children under 9 I think I have some knowledge in the area of chilren's books. Junie B. is a rude, disrespectful, nasty, child. These books don't encourage anything good! We read half of one and, like someone else said, I had to keep stopping and explaining to the kids how wrong she was. I don't agree with the way books like these have bad character traits glorified the whole way through and then have 2 pages of ""a lesson"" at the end. Children simply don't absorb the lesson. We work hard to instill noble character traits in our children and books like these work against that. If you think these are good books for young children something is seriously wrong. I would strongly suggest you don't buy these books!"
1,Too much bad grammar,"Although these books hold my daughter's attention, I don't like the constant conflict and name calling. I also find myself changing words on almost every page. She is too young to understand slang vs. proper English and now as she is developing grammar skills is not the time to hear slang. Unfortunately for me, she knows what shelf these are on in our library. I wish we had never started."
2,Not appropriate,"My 4 year-old was growing out of her picture books, so i decided to get her started on some chapter books. The Junie B. books looked like a good series because the character is close to the same age as my daughter, but i was floored by the use and frequency of words like ""hate, dumb, stupid"". these are not words that i want my children using. Needless to say, we will be looking for another, more appropriate series to read."
1,Your Child Deserves Better,My 6 year old daughter brought one of these books home and I was disappointed it was even available in the school library. The grammar is awful and the main character has an attitude no one should encourage their child to have. There are a lot of early reading books that are both entertaining and educational without leading young children in the wrong direction. Try some books by E. B. White.
1,"As an educator I say these are a no,no","I know reading should be fun. It is however also very educational. Children begin to learn larger vocabulary and correct grammar structure through books. When they are purposefully written in the way that the Junie B. Books are it is very undermining to the greater educational purpose of books. I find it disturbing that so many parents think the antics of the protaganist are ""cute"". Stupid, a word so often used in this series, is the BAD ""S"" word to many KD-3rd graders who will be reading these books. With so many other much, much better choices for young childrens literature(I hesitate to even call these literature!) why parents would choose these is beyond me."
1,Horrible for impressionable kids,"My daughter recieved a bunch of these books for Christmas. While *I* personally get a kick out of them, my daughter has resorted to bad language and wanting to stuff babies into closets (among other things) because that is what this character does. She shrieks out in class, speaks disrespectfully to adults, and makes decisions that are downright dangerous (hiding on a schoolbus during a class trip, eating garbage off the ground, ect). I can go on and on. While I understand that it is my responsibility to teach my child right from wrong, these books work in the opposite direction. I am tempted to throw this trash into the nearest fire pit."
1,AWFUL!,These books are so bad that I contacted the elmentary school librarian and principal about pulling them. That pretty much sums it up! AVOID!
4,Junie B. Jone's Stories,"My son is almost 7 and just starting to read chapter books. We are in the middle of the first book. The books are very cute, but there are a ton of words we consider ""bad"" that he keeps repeating. I know it is all in fun, but I just hope he doesn't think it is o.k. to say them out at school now."
1,What horrible books for children!,"We bought a set of these books for my 6 yr old daughter. We were VERY disappointed. The grammar is horrible and Junie B. Jones is very sassy. I don't think there is any redeeming value in reading a book to my child that teaches her to speak incorrectly and to be rude to adults. Disagree with me? Then ""Hey! Shut up your face!"" - a direct quote from Junnie in ""Yucky Blucky Fruitcake."" I rest my case ...."
1,Bad Example,"If you're a parent of a kindergartener, these books will crack you up. They portray the behavior of an out-of-control kindergartener with amazing accuracy! BUT, don't read this series to your kindergartener! The countless examples of how to act inappropriately are the last thing a kindergartener needs to hear. Read books that will teach your child how to have self-control, good manners, kindness and respect towards others, and to speak with proper grammar. These books teach quite the opposite!"
2,All the things you don't want your Kindergarter to model...,"I picked this box set thinking it would be a great way to introduce my soon to be Kindergartener to small chapter books. Like other parents I found myself editing out words like ""hate, stupid"" etc. Far too many times. Then there are the things that she does in the book that surely wouldn't want my daughter to attempt. Like hiding in the classroom closet, falls asleep and is alone there after school is over...I understand they are for entertainment and not meant to be taken seriously so I am thinking these books MIGHT be ok for an older child who ""knows better"". If your child is younger like mine I would steer clear for a few years."
1,Mimicking poor behavior,"We read the first set of Junie B. stories on recommendation to our daughter. Over the course of three weeks reading the stories we noticed her behavior and manners declining. She was mimicking Junie B.'s language and descriptions of people (""that boy I hate""). We regret reading her these stories and have gone back to the classics - Stuart Little, Heidi, Little House on the Prairie and she enjoys those books just as well."
1,Junie is little brat with poor grammar,"I don't know why so many parents recommended this series.The title character is little brat that use words like ""dumb"", ""hate"", and ""fat"". She has very poor grammar. I think it is supposed to be funny, but I just found her to be annoying and selfish.I am so sorry that I ever bought these."
3,Great stories-Poor Grammar,"My daughter really loves the stories, but doesn't like the reading pattern. she hasn't talked with broken english like that since she was 3, and never used all the slang that is in the book. My husband sat down to read one with her and after the first paragraph went and grabbed a pencil to correct the grammatical errors, which he really thought to be typos, til he got to the second page and realized it was throughout the book. At this point he decided it better for her not to read them herself, but instead to have them read to her so that we could read them grammatically correct. We have since bought her the Ramona series for her to read on her own and she gets the same type of stories and adventures without the grammar problems. We just didn't want her thinking it was okay for her to talk the way that Junie B. does. We have since read one of the 1st grade Junie B.'s and have to admit we appreciate that the grammar errors have disappeared on the most part."
2,"Sorry, Barbara Park, but a little too immature for school","This little girl needs to be demoted to preschool and taught how to interact with normal kids. This is not to say there are no children this wierd, but she's definitely not normal. Perhaps that is what the author is after. However, for children to really enjoy a book they must be able to parallel themselves with the character.I realize this is a huge series with a wide audience and much demand; however, this is a page for my opinion and it must account for something. There are other books with funny stories, adventurous characters, and those who are not funny because they are stupid. If you like stupid, this book is a great read!"
3,junie b. jones smells something fishy.,"Junie B. Jones Smells Something Fishy is a good book, nice book. This book is about pet day at school, but dogs are not allowed. Her parents will not buy her a new pet. I wanted a new pet once but I could not have one. I think 7-8 year-olds will enjoy this book."
1,A relief that I am not alone.,"This set of books is always recommended and revered, but I always thought the language and Junie's actions and tantrums were atrocious. I too found myself trying to substitute words for more parts of the book than we could read. I kept thinking, maybe my daughter is not old enough. Well, I am now thinking she will never be old enough, I mean I am shocked by these books. I agree that it is essential for children to develop a love of reading, but let's do it with Jack and Annie (The Magic Tree House), or Cam Jansen, or something where the children do not act like the deliquents we all hope our children do not bring home as their new best friend!!"
5,"Observant, respectful","Yes, I said ""respectful.""Many people say, these books are inappropriate for children in the target age group, around K through 2nd grade. Many say, they like the Magic Tree House series so much better.Well, I disagree, and here is why - where MTH is patronising, Junie Jones is light-hearted. Where MTH is in your face with educational content, JJ is subtle. And where MTH simply uses characters of early school age and adorns them with artificial, adult-like behaviours, JJ is observant of the way these kids really are, and respects them as characters of the narrative rather than simply abuse them to get a message across.So while Junie B. Jones as a character may not always be respectful, these books as such are more respectful of the kids that read them than are the MTH books.Oh, and they're freakin' hilariuous too."
1,Who needs the bad grammar?,"The story line is indeed amusing, but who wants to teach their young readers with a heavy dose of bad grammar? My five year old uses English with more precision, and although she giggles at Junie's antics, I am disappointed that every other sentence is incorrect. ""Grandma says I'm gonna get runned over by an ice cream truck."" ""After that, I got sended to my room."" Who needs this? I don't think it adds any value, nor does it make Junie more believably 6 years old to have her unable to conjugate a verb. And no, I'm not a grammar teacher, nor a librarian."
5,Junie B. Jones three boxed sets books 1-12,"When a children's book make an adult laugh, you know you've got a tiger by the tail! Our granddaughters, ages 6, 6 1/2, and 7 1/2 spent two weeks with us this summer and in preparation for their visit, I ordered the first 12 Junie B. Jones books, thinking maybe one of the little girls would enjoy them. I underestimated - all three loved them to pieces! They carted them everwhere we went, snickering quietly as they read to themselves. I couldn't have asked for a better way to amuse them during long car rides and before they went to bed. Gramps even cracked up as I read to them in the car on the way home from a long day at the zoo! Lovely books written in a child's voice. But definetly just for girls."
1,I will never buy another JBJ,"Junie B. Jones is the worst children's reading material I have ever read. I was appauled at this horrible monster of a child. I know of NO 5 year old who speaks so poorly to the point it appears she is just unintelligent. Promoting bad behavior and poor speech skills is NOT funny NOR entertaining. After my daughter, age 7, read 4 of these books, we had a negative behavior nightmare with her. She got this from the books. Such as; calling names, saying she hates someone, speaking well under her ability, showing disrespect to adults, just downright obnoxious. Ask me where the books went???? My daughter is back to her old self and I am in search of reading material that doesn't teach a child how to be an illiterate brat, who needs her butt kicked."
1,Just Plain Garbage,"My daughter just entered first grade and is supposed to pick out a book from the library every week to help her learn how to read. She brought home Junie B books two weeks in a row. They are garbage. Twenty five percent of the words are misspelled or misused. Junie B is vile, nasty and rude. By reading such trash, my daughter is never going to learn how to spell words properly or use them correctly. My wife and I have banned them from our house."
1,There are better kids' books out there.,"After comparing an excerpt from ""Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business"" [...] with an excerpt from ""The Great Gilly Hopkins"" [...] I noticed one huge difference:In ""The Great Gilly Hopkins,"" even though Gilly speaks and thinks in slang and with grammatical shortcuts, the surrounding writing is largely grammatically correct.This way, the reader can both get into Gilly's mind and character and also learn good grammar.In contrast, in ""Junie B. Jones..."" there are comparatively few grammatically correct sentences. Even descriptive sentences are written in Junie's poor grammar, including many sentence fragments starting with ""and"" : ""The baby pajamas were very weensy. And the baby socks wouldn't even fit on my big piggie toe."" This could easily be two more or less correct sentences if the second ""and"" were removed.The dialogue is pretty clever by itself. I agree with reviewers who say that the intervening bad grammar is affected and unnecessary."
1,atrocious grammar,"My first grade daughter just received a boxed set of Junie B. books from a Scholastic Press book order. I purchased them at her insistence that these ""books are great""(they have them in her class at school), having no prior experience myself with the series. When I opened them up at random and started reading, I was appalled at the poor grammar on almost every page. While I recognize that the books are written in a childs voice, and are meant to relate to young children, I still find the grammar in them atrocius. Overall the books are very disappointing. I would not recommend these to anyone.Is this the best we can offer to young readers who are learning to speak, read and write correctly???????"
1,Not impressed,"I bought these books because a friend said they were great however I cannot continue to read these to my daughter. Junie is 5 years old but as smart/mature as a 2 year old. Also the language is terrible because she is constantly calling children ""stupid, fat & dumb"" and she HATES everything. She really is a menace of a child and I found the books hard to read to my child (age 5) because I had to keep changing the language. I am very surprised they get such a high rating."
1,Why not a zero star rating?,"I completely agree with DTG9000--the Junie B. books are awful! The character is not a child I would want my daughter to emulate by any means. My daughter is a first grader and having read two of these books, we've had enough of this little stinker's antics and commentary--apart from cheeky behavior, the grammar is inappropriate for children learning the English language, too. What is author Barbara Park thinking?? What kind of education is she seeking to provide?? Give these books a pass."
1,These books deserve ZERO stars!,"I am also at a total loss for words. I wanted a new book series for my son so I thought I'd give the Junie B. series a try. I bought the Monkey Business story and Valentine story for my son because today is Valentine's Day. What a BAD decision. After the first chapter my son was staring at me in disbelief...the character is a ROTTEN girl. I thought maybe it would get better so we read the second chapter. NO BETTER! My five year old son and I together decided this was not a series of books we wanted to read. Junie B. is an embarrassment to young literary characters. There is nothing redeeming about her, and her parents are pathetic!! Do not waste your time or money on these books. Check out Magic Treehouse or a number of QUALITY books series for young pre-readers and early readers."
5,Great for long rode trips!,"Junie B. Jones cassettes entertained my 5 and 9 year olds, when we were driving back from Xmas at Grandma's. I didn't hear them asking when we would be getting home! They listened closely, and want to hear the rest of the series!"
5,PERFECT GIFT,This gift was the perfect way to start our child's reading collection. I sure she will cherish it for many years to come.
5,Best Christmas Present,"My 7 year old son absolutley LOVES these books! They are perfect for his reading level in 1st grade and keep him completely engrossed. This set was one of the ""smaller"" gifts we got him this year for Christmas (we do our family present opening early) and he still has not put the books down!"
3,Questionable words for kids.,"These stories are o.k. with fairly cute ideas, but what concerns me are some of the words. Stupid, dumb, hate, and big fat smelly are used over and over, which I know aren't swear words or anything, but words I don't really want my kids to say\read. When reading, I leave them out, but I won't be buying anymore Junie B Jones for my kids."
1,ungrammatical-disservice to new and old readers,"I was told it is a very popular beginning reader chapter book series so I bought it and started to read it to my grandchildrenI WAS APPALLED!!! OUTRAGEDThe grammar is atrocious- a true disservice to those learning the rudiments of language and reading. Will the author try misspellings and misformed letters next?Joanie B. Jones is supposed to be in kindergarten, but the vocabulary/grammar cutsies are not even those of a two- two1/2 year-old. They are just stupid. This is not an attempt at dialogue or street talk. The illustrations show JBJ as white, and big, and the errors are not street or dialect.For instance [from _Sneaky Peeky Spying_]:""I'm the bestest spier in the whole world""""I hidded in the dirty clothes hamper """"And Mother runned into the room.""""Except for she beated me.""""And we all runned to Room Niine Speedy quick.""That's every two pages. I won't go on.Skip this series."
1,"So I am not alone, thank goodness.","My daughter is in first grade and they went to see a Junie B. Jones play in the theater.. she loved it and she told me that they were reading the Junie B. Jones books in class everyday.. so I got one for her and when I read it, I just didn't know what to think. Maybe it was just me but as I read in one of the other reviews, I found myself telling her that all what this girl does isn't something that she could do. We had to stop very often for me to repeat that ""this isn't very nice"", or ""you wouldn't do that, would you?"". Anyway, I""m glad I'm not the only one.. maybe this book would be good for third or fourth graders who can tell that this is just a fun book to read, sort of like ""catcher in the rye"" for high school students.."
1,Inappropriate for young readers!,"I wanted to like these books, but after listening to my Kindergartner read a few pages, I had to stop her. Throughout the books, young readers will find both glaring and subtle grammatical errors, such as ""me and Grace"" and ""I did a giggle"". Additionally, many of the scenarios and topics addressed in the stories are of questionable appropriateness (e.g., discussing ""cops resting [sic] drunk people."" While I respect creative liberties generally in representing a Kindergartner's use of language, if the purpose of literature is to enhance literacy while also creating rich contexts for such learning, then these books accomplish just the opposite. How can we teach our children to speak and write correctly and compellingly if these are the examples with which we provide them? I'm sorry if I come across philosophically, but I feel nearly betrayed by the professional negligence demonstrated by this author."
3,Not bad....,"I completely understand both sides of the argument about the Junie B. books. Having said that, I'm of the opinion that her bad behavior and terrible grammar are an excellent learning opportunity as well as very entertaining. Quite honestly and very imoportantly they get my son reading. Not everything adults read are proper in language and behavior, we read for entertainment and that's what I chalk this up to. But I'm the kind of person to give her son free reign to her bookshelves because, you know, knowledge is power. And that knowledge can be found in even the silliest of books."
3,Had to correct the grammar while reading!,"Yes, this was a funny little book that my 6 year old daughter got a kick out of. However, as I read it aloud to her, I found myself correcting Junie's poor grammar and wincing at some of the comments she made about other characters in her book.After getting though the box set, I was excited to find a much more suitable replacement. I HIGHLY recommend the ""The World According to Humphrey"" as well as the other ""According to Humphrey"" books by Betty G Birney. My daughter loves them so much (we just finished book 5, I believe there are 6 in all), I have purchased every single audio book so she can listen to them over and over! She's constantly laughing out loud as she listens to this little hamster's adventures as the classroom pet.Hope this helps!"
1,Horrible grammar and bad attitude,I would not recommend the Junie B. Jones books. Not only did the bad behavior and attitude throw me off completely but the horrible grammar often made it extremely difficult to read the story. I am confused why horrible grammar and sentence structure would be used in a book appropriate for school children.
1,I am throwing the whole 4 sets away - they teach bad grammar and bad manner.,"My husband told me that he got so upset reading this book to our 4-year old. He had to edit out the bad grammar and bad words constantly. I opened one of the books and immediately spotted words such as ""hidded"" and ""runned"". I do not think these books are right for young children. We will have to throw them away. I can not believe Random Books published these books."
1,Junie has a bad attitude,"Totally agree with others that this is not a character to like. I suppose the author is trying to make her spunky, but I had to edit every page when I read it to my daughter. I want books to model good behavior not bad. SHe calls people stupid, says she ""hates"" people etc."
1,I don't recommend these books,"I bought the first box set of Junie B Jones at the recommendation of my daughter's first grade teacher. I have read books one and two, trying to give them a chance. As I started book 3 I realized that these books were not going to get better and decided I would return them. The stories have promise but the attitude and actions of the title character are HORRIBLE and I don't want my daughter influenced by the books at her young age of six. If you are thinking of buying these books for your child, PLEASE read one first to determine if you want your child reading about a self-centered, bratty, unremorseful, bratty child."
1,Can't be good for budding readers,"I loathe Junie B. Jones. She is supposed to be ""cute"" by using bad grammar and misusing words. It might be harmless fun for an adult (although I wouldn't think an adult would read these), but it CAN'T be good for a child who is learning how to read. Do you want your child, who is just learning how to read and write, to have bad or incorrect writing as an example to emulate? My daughter was assigned one of these books in first grade and I immediately complained and insisted she be given a different book. Seriously. This is educational malpractice. Don't inflict these on your child."
1,Brenna's Review,"In the smelly bus one Junie's nose gets sniffly. this is probably becase books are her favoritest thing, so when she reads instead of play outside she gets sensitive to things like school buses, dont read this book or any book because if you read then fatty flob stores up in yoour tummy. i know this becaues my friend Nina has a flabby pink tummy from too mujch reading so sometimes I pinch, jab or punch Nina's tummy to tell her not to read so much"
4,Thank Heaven--Season Seven!,"There are truly some REAL good episodes in this season. ""Dark Page"", ""Attached"", ""Lower Decks"" & ""Preemptive Strike""...just to name a few. Truly a must for STTNG fans."
5,"""All Good Things...""","This set is worth it just for the finale alone. I think ""All Good Things..."" is the best episode in ST: TNG. Amazing concept and well directed. This was more engaging of a Star Trek story than ""Generations"" which came out the same year. Besides, its the last season, you might as well purchase this one too."
4,GREAT!... Almost as good as Voyager,"I LOVED this season! It's probably the best one of TNG. My personal preference is Voyager (Female Cpatains ALL THE WAY!... and not to meantion great plots, and a fantastic theme song!!!), but this is definetly sencond best. TOS is dull, TNG's great, DS9 is pretty slow, Enterprise is NOT good, but Voyager is great! If this is your first time watching Star Trek, go for either this or Voyager."
5,One of the Best DVD sets Ever !!!!,I've been a fan of star trek for many years and have say that this dvdset is one of the best star trek items I have ever brought. And I think everytrekker out there with a dvd player should buy this dvd set and the other sixdvd sets NOW!!! Any fan out there who doesn't buy these sets is apatok [thats klingon for idiot] . So in conclusion BUY THIS PRODUCTNOW!!! You won't regret it. Each set is worth every dollar you pay for it.
2,Brent Spiner is a method actor! Beware!,"Yes, your beloved Data is crazy in real life. Method actors do nutty things to play parts. They feel they can't play a role until they figure out their motivation. They crazily feel they have to research their character's professions before they can play them (example:method actress Jody Foster felt she had to study for months what a scientist did in real life before she could play oine on film). They have to really get in the emotional state their character is supposed to be in before they can play the character. Berserk!"
2,Worst of all the series,"I am a total Star Trek Fan and have bought every series. I don't know what happend with the Seventh Season, but it came no where near an equal of the others. It appears to me that many of the standard actors really didn't want to do Star Trek. Most all the episodes reminded me of more of a murder mystery rather than a Science Fiction serious----they seemed to be burned out with the standard themes that has made me a Trek Fan for many years. They moved away from their past successful themes. I missed Whoopee Goldberg. After watching this, I understand why it got canceled."
3,Boldly go...,"I always thought that TNG was far better than the original series even though I liked Kirk better than Picard. The last season was as good as any season. So why only 3 stars? Because I always felt the premise of the show was as absurd as suggesting communism was a workable theory.Fans of the series will appreciate this collection and I recommend it to them. As for the rest of us, just watch them on TV and that's more than enough."
3,TNG Deserved More from the 'top' for the final season....,"While there are some extreme high points in the 7th season, why Paramount decided to 'b' list the show that essentially made them a television force is beyond me... Cutting the budget, and diverting the best writers to Deep Space Nine was just absurd... Instead of maintaining the final season as a tour de force to go down in history, they allowed themselves to be distracted by far too many projects, and sadly, for the dedicated TNG fans (not DS9 fans as yet)our expectations (inspired by what we had seen thus far)were not met.... I remember at the time the episodes were first broadcast wondering to myself what was going on.... I would go further to say that with DS9 and Voyager, the TNG films may have suffered a bit as well...."
1,A mistake by Amazon - this is just part 1 over again!,"Amazon has made a mistake here - this is simply part one again, not part two as it is supposed to be. This needs to be fixed."
3,"The DVD's are great, the box came with a big ding in it.","The packaging was not a box, it came in a bubble envelope and the box has a corner crunched. It did not harm the DVD's inside, but it is a gift for my daughter who collects these things. That was a disappointment, I am not returning it because I need to give it for a gift, but I certainly thought about it."
5,Wonderful!!!,This tastes and looks like the real thing (wheat/semolina) My kids can't tell the difference. I'm not wasting my time sampling all of the others now.
5,The best gluten free pasta,"Having celiac disease for 3 years now, I have tried numerous brands of pasta. I had given up, and then my local grocer started carrying this one.It is the closest to reg pasta , without that funny rice after taste. I only like the spagg. though, the elbows etc still have that funky taste.I even have this with just olive oil and garlic, no sauce needed to hide the taste.Be careful not to overcook it. I find it gets too gummy when overcooked. Also rinse well as was suggested."
5,Good quality,I've been GF for a while now so I can't comment on its likeness to wheat pasta but the texture and taste are both perfect to a GF pallet!
2,I have to disagree,"I'm afraid I disagree with the other two reviews. I thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like. It does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly. It's an OK substitute but there are much better gluten-free pastas out there. Although the Glutino is cheaper, I personally like Orgran pasta 100 times better."
1,buyer BEWARE!,"The one thing that has not been mentioned in any of these reviews is the license for this product. This software cannot be used for commercial use without permission from one of their ""duly authorized representatives"". I'm not sure, but I bet this is a costly proposition. So if you want this product for an amusing game, it's fine. If you want to use it for music that you plan to sell, even if you are including your own playing on it, avoid it.If you think that making loops of your own playing will let you off the hook, no, it won't. The license includes anything made with the software, so even if you want to sell your own music, PLAYED BY YOU, you have to talk to one of their representatives. If they give you permission to sell your OWN work, you still have to put their logo on it, which says, ""Magix Creation"". How nice......"
1,Magix mp3 Maker 2005 Deluxe is a bad buy,"I've had a real bad experience with this product. When it comes to WMA ripping or converting (audio that are bit long, like 3.5 mins plus) it totally fails, it simply doesn't work. The only way to communicate with the company, MAGIX, is to email them. I'm still waiting for a response (I think has been 3 months). Their web support forum is really bad. You just find other people like me, having problems, trying to help each other out. Buyer beware of any of their products, especially if you require tech support."
4,Ultimate Love Story,"Although this is a work of fiction, the story of Jenna Haywood and Randolph Fuller is evidence that ""soul mates"" do exist. This love affair began when Randolph and Jenna were in college and never faltered. Tragedy sent them their separate ways, living separate lives.Later, when Jenna calls on Randolph for a favor (to represent an old college friend on trial for murder) they realize that they are still very much in love with each other even after 12 years of separation. Randolph and Jenna's lives together and apart are infused with lies, deceit and tragedy but their love is the tie that binds. Brenda Jackson's writing is simply amazing.Reviewed by Ronna Walls"
4,Great until around the ending,"Okay, Brenda had me with this book from page one. I couldn't stop reading it. The whole story with Randolph and Jenna was so touching and beautiful. The only thing that got me was when his son by Angela and her daughter by her ex husband hooked up. To me that's kind of gross because Randolph and Jenna got married so that made Ross III and Haywood step brother and sister. Now Randolph and Jenna had a child together making her their half sister respectively. THAT'S JUST GROSS to me. I don't think they should've hooked up. Other than that, I'm glad that they really found each other again after all of the deviousness that went on for far too long."
2,my opinion,i really was angered by the ending of this book. the book was excellent in the beginning. excellent in the middle but the end repulsed me. i just dont c why they ended up like that it was just sickening. i got really upset. i have read several of Brenda Jacksons books. all of which i loved. however i was extremely disapointed with this one. i recommend all of her other books. but not this one......
5,Different and Well Appreciated,"I am a member of the FM Band Book club and I totally enjoyed Ties that Bond. The history lessons were totally enjoyable. I also always apprciate a happy ending. This was very much a page turner, our book club members enjoyed the authors style so much we selected another Brenda Jackson book for our next months book. We selected ""Savvy Sistahs"", have not started it yet but I am looking forward to it."
5,Wonderfully entertaining read!,"This was such a great book. I couldn't put it down once I started getting into the storyline. Not many authors can integrate historical events into such a romantic plot the way that Brenda Jackson can. Many events such as the Black Panther movement and the September 11 attacks are in this book, and play roles almost as important as the characters. There are plenty of primary and secondary characters to keep the plot moving; the book itself is divided into three main parts. This is the first book that I've read by this author and I can't wait to run out to the bookstore and read another!"
5,Great novel,I really and truly enjoyed reading this book. I spent a couple of nights up reading because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. You definitely won't regret buying this book
1,very dissapointed,"The product desciption is very misleading: first, the picture on the DVD cover is a female instructor, but actually the whole DVD is demonstrated by a male (that's not what I want!); second, again the cover pictured is filmed in a beautiful bay, so I thought this DVD was just like another DVD instructed by the same person ""YOGA FOR BEGINNERS"", which ""was filmed on location at one of the most beautiful, tranquil beaches in the world, Half-Moon Bay, Antigua, which adds to the overall experience of tranquility"". But actually this DVD was filmed in a small empty room (so boring background!) Thirdly, since I lost my remote control and this DVD couldn't move fast-forword by pressing the buttons on the DVD player itself, I have to watch the boring interview with the instructor before I could see the real workouts!"
5,All aboard the Love Boat,"Loved this show back in the day. Who wouldn't want to spend time with the crew of the Love Boat and all the cool guest stars. Some of the guest stars include Charo, Anne Meara, Jerry Stiller, Corey Feldman, Beth Howland, Ken Berry, Arte Johnson, Peter Lawford, Jill St. John, Elinor Donahue, Debbie Allen, Dennis Cole and many more."
5,Escapism television at it's best,"Love relaxing to a DVD of the Love Boat, fun to watch what eveyone was wearing and all of the old actors. Too bad they don't make 'em like they used to. Great quality, for the price you can't beat it. If you're a fan, a must, if you're looking for good time '70-ish television, don't pass these up :)"
1,Keys stopped working,"Junk. After a short time, many keys stopped working. I sent it back to the factory and had the whole key-assembly replaced under a recall. Now, after a year of very light usage half the keys don't work again. JUNK!"
1,Threw mine away.,Just as everyone else I had the same problem. On my PCR-30 the keys stopped working after about a year. Nothing else to add really.
2,"Have had 3 of these, keys stop working","I like the size and transposing functions, very useful. But I've had 3 and keys eventually stop working, within a year or so. If you have one, you can get the keys working again by taking it apart and applying graphite powder to the metal contacts under the rubber strip. But the rubber strip is hard to get back on correctly without damaging it a little each time you do it. Since I have 3 of these, I've got some spare rubber strips. Edirol is owned by Roland but is very far from being Roland quality."
1,what a piece of junk,after only one year of moderate use some keys started to fade and then stoped responding altogether. wasted money.
2,Keep on searching!,"I bought this to keep my little one from getting his fingers caught in our Lazy Susan. It installed easily and worked well. Too bad it is plastic...and cheap plastic at that. The first one broke after 3 weeks. The second one broke after two! Before it snapped it really did work well though! I'm on the lookout for something better. If I don't find anything good, I will have to clear out the entire cabinet and then install yet another one of these locks. If the mechanism doesn't get used regularly it won't break. Hate to lose the cabinet space, but at least I won't have to worry about pinched fingers."
1,Waste of money,This product only lasted 2weeks. The adhesive does not stick well. I wasted a good bit of money after S&H and the cost.
4,Easy to install,This a good product. It took me no time to install and works very well for a lazy susan cabinet. I ordered charcoal and it works well for my kitchen. I believe the picture above is some other color.
3,"Nice stuff, but beware of potential double shipping charges","Griot's can be a bit pricey, but it is nice first class stuff. Their boar's hair car wash brush is supreme. Some of their items are unique Griot's products, while other stuff you'll often see elsewhere at a discount...."
3,"Great practice, but not specifically for travelers or students on the go","I totally agree with the reviewer ""J.S."" who said this was a thorough but incomplete book. It's a wonderful practice book with plenty of exercises for beginners and intermediate students, however, if you're looking for some quick vocabulary to use on a trip, this is not what you're looking for. Instead, practice with Pimsleur'sBasic Italian: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)."
5,American wonks are a global menace.,"Chapter four in this astonishingly important book describes incompetence and corruption which devasted Russia when Washington gave Harvard University virtually dictatorial powers to ""reform"" Russia's post-communist economic system. Not only was our ivory-tower privatization a fiasco but we left a shameful legacy of hatred and distrust. Harvard made Stalin look good. As a US citizen I wish devoutly there were a way for us to undo the insult and harm. As a nation we chose to forget what we inflicted on the Russian people in 1918 - by brutal efforts to destroy ""socialism"" which only pushed that reform into remorseless paranoia and terror. Russians and ""socialists"" will never forget it. In the 1990's we blundered again. The rest of this book is anthropology, which - as an economist - I found distinctly less interesting. Maybe that's a fault in me. But for all our sakes I hope it will not discourage people from getting the truth in chapter four."
3,Not much to sink your teeth into,"I was disapointed in this book. There's a lot of ""pay attention to this or that"" but not much actual help. If you have no clue what makes a good composition, maybe it will be helpful to you, but I thought it was pretty top level. ""Light is important, texture is important, balance is important."" Duh."
4,Quite good,I would say the focus is on composing good nature shots. The illustrations and text are well put together.I bought 20 books on photography and have given 1-5 star reviews. So pay more attention to the stars than to the missing elaboration
5,Very good.,"It's a very good book. It is not very academic, it is most artistic ant it makes the diffrerence"
3,"Content Good, Construction, Not so","I purchased this book as a gift for my husband who's learning as much as he can about photography and photo composition. He is impressed with the content of the book and is learning quite a bit. However, after only 10 days, pages are already breaking loose from the glue spine and falling out of the book itself."
3,I can't understand why everyone else gave this book 5 stars,"I bought this book sight unseen, based on the strength of all the 5-star reviews below. My mistake. It's a decent enough book, with lots of nice photos, but in my opion it certainly doesn't deserve a 5-star rating. There isn't anything in this book that isn't in dozens of other photography books, and there's nothing outstanding in it. It's not a bad book at all, but it's not a great book either."
2,Blowing own trumpet,"I bought this booking thinking that it can make me learn few important things but alas all it teaches me is how to spend more on filters and trying to understand the photographs taken by author, We are interested in finding our own creativity but not a borrowed one, this book is such a disappointment..."
5,Great Overview of Outdoor Photographic Techniques,"The heading says it all. Nicely illustrated, covering the basics of outdoor photography. Touches on digital."
5,Great Read for a Beginner Like Me.,Great Read for a Beginner Like Me.Ever wonder why so many photos you took are utter crap?I did and I found this book. It teaches you the art of composition.For all the technical stuff read a blog or something.
2,Very dissapointed,"One of the reasons I purchased this movie was based upon a customer review that was posted on Amazon which gave this movie a five star rating. You've got to be kidding me. I am usually very generous with my ratings, but this movie was pathetic. It is proof that you shouldn't believe everything you read. I loved Heather Beers in Charley, so I was excited to see her again in this movie. The acting across the board was very poor, and what was up with the scene of the dead boy from the 1940's? That was just flat out creapy! Why in the world was that in the movie?! Really strange. Don't waste your money on this one. Take my word for it."
1,Not What It Appears To Be,"I got this movie thinking it was a Christian based film (a movie with a Christian worldview). In the description of the movie it says ""with the faith that inspired them as children"". However, the faith they are talking about is not the Christian faith but Mormonism. Evidently this movie was made by a Mormon group and includes scenes where Mormon missionaries are teaching about their beliefs.These scenes seem to be trying to also evangelize the rest of us to Mormonism. What they are talking about is a different path that does not lead to salvation. Salvation is through faith in Jesus, not the Latter-Day Saints (Mormonism).I would've liked if they at least made it clear somewhere, who this movie was made by-the LDS. Then, I could've understood the real point of the movie, before I spent my money."
5,Solo,"This album is a superb example of contemporary country with strong folk influence. The Owl Song establishes Rick's indrebile vocal range. ""Shot and a Beer Town"" reminds me of Springsteen. This should be the start of a great career following his bluegrass Dog Run labels."
4,Rick Malis is a great singer AND songwriter,"This is a terrific solo effort from a seasoned singer/songwriter. Rick Malis writes powerful lyrics with great melody lines. His stylistic variety ranges from the acoustic,haunting 'Owl's Song'and 'Shot and a Beer Town' to the swinging 'Don't Blame the Devil' to the smoky, jazzy 'She knows the way to my heart'. He has a great voice for all these styles. Check this guy out."
3,Half worked,The whole retractable thing is really cool. It charged my m130 just fine. But it did not work as a data cable
3,Adequate but chintzy...,"Tried to choose from many of this type sold on Amazon. Picture looked good. Arrived very fast. But chintzily made. Difficult to get wires retracted once expanded. In retrospect I would have gone for another, twice as expensive one -- made by a brand I didn't know at the time but know to be quality now.However, it is lightweight -- it does work -- easy to carry in purse for emergencies."
2,guinea pig,"Well I bought this knowing I would be a guinea pig and here it goes. First off it isn't the same product. The one I got is some cheap blue plastic one that allows for 2 PS controller's, which at first I thought was cool. But then on to the disapointment. It works. . . Sometimes. . . Sometimes it likes to let you use the arrow keys. . . Sometimes it says nah not today. *FAIL* On to try another one. I am trying to use this to play DDR. I have Red Octane dance pads and really don't want to spend another $100-$200 on buying new ones that are PS3 specific. Some people's have worked great but this wasn't the product in the picture and it doesn't work for me. Good luck to all you that try this. I REALLY hope it works. . . Especially for the price. . . was $4 now under $2. . . . In closing lets just say it works as long as you don't press 2 buttons at the same time. . . Like you can press Up and Left at the same time but not Left and Right. . . I think there is some improving to be done."
2,It depends on what you get it for I guess.,"I have a ps3 obviously and have purcheased this controller converter with the expectation to use a wireless guitar hero guitar for my playstation 3. The converter worked but only partially. The delay has grown on it's response, the whammy bar no longer works as a whammy bar but as a strummer. But for the price I guess somethings are expected. When I use the ps2 controller with it for some reason the games tend to pause as if the controller has been disconnected. The converter works but expect some issues that you may not want. If you can't handle the converter not doing a perfect job don't get it just get another ps3 controller."
1,Waste of money. Avoid this product!,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this product. But, to my disappointment, this item did not work at all. It never allowed me to play a single minute of gameplay. Dont waste your time buying this. Buyer beware!"
1,I had my doubts,Unfortunately it didn't work. Tried to use it with guitar hero and gran turismo. I think I'll cut the ends off and use it as a shoelace.
2,ps2 to ps3 controll converter,the controll converter was defective. i was VERY upset with this and i will NEVER order from here again!!!!
1,Doesn't work with Ps2 games on PS3,"This adapter doesn't have a ""PS"" button which means that things like dancepads, driving wheels etc that you'd like to bring over from your PS2, won't work. When the PS3 runs a PS2 game it wants you to press the ""PS"" key to register the controller. No ""PS"" button, no work."
4,Works fine,"The dual shock 2 work fine, despising the fact the pressure control not work but the vibration is good!. The DDR dance pad work fine. I recommend this product!"
5,converter review,This is an excellent product.I've tested with 4 games and worked perfectly.The games were:- Uncharted: Drake's fortune- Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 & 2010- Fifa 10Congratulations to the seller.
4,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"If you have a PS3 and you probably do if you're reading this review GET THIS ITEM NOW!!!!! This is a great converter especially if you want to play fighting games on your PS3 both 2D and 3D Street fighter Alpha Anthology no problem, Tekken 5 DRO no problem if I have one complaint it is that the converter has no home button but all in all a great item"
1,Doesn't work with Wireless Guitars,"I bought two of these so that I could play Guitar Hero 1, 2, and the 80's on the PS3, but alas, neither of them worked. For a split second, one worked and then it was gone.It's possible there's something that can be done and I haven't totally given up yet as I really NEED this to work, but I doubt it. If I do find something, I will update this review."
3,Good but Unsure...,I bought this and my wireless ps2 controllers work just fine... my Guitar for Guitar Hero not so much. My PS3 went wacky when I tried pluggin in my Guitar Hero 2 Guitar ... Havent found ample fixes for that yet..
4,PS2 to PS3 controller,My son was son happy to receive this controller in order to hook up his PS2 controllers to his new PS3 gaming system.It works great and we didn't need to purchase new controllers.
1,Terrible.,"Terrible. Does not work at all. This seems to be a scam, because I plugged my controllers in and it only works in the Home Screen. After that, it doesn't even work."
3,ps2 to ps3,"i was really surprise about this product.. it worked on my ps3 just fine ., only problem it doesnt have the ps buttom but i manage without it, also it wont work on my laptop it keeps asking me for a driver ... besides this., it works great for my games on ps3.."
2,"Should be called Rick Steve's ""Denmark""","I am a fan of Rick Steve's series. My first was the Germany book and found it absolutely great on a back-packing adventure through Bavaria and the Mosel Valley. But when I bought ""Scandinavia"" for a recent trek through Kobenhaven, Sweeden, and Norway I was sorely dissapointed.1. The maps lacked A LOT of detail.2. If you stray from the ""Norway in a nutshell"" tour, the book has very limited information on the rest of Norway. We travelled to Bodo and the Lofoten Islands to the north. Wish he would have writeen about them...3. Lot's of voids on where to eat.4. Spent way too much of the book focused on Denmark. Maybe re-title the book Steve!"
1,beware: this is a CD-R,"After getting two different copies of this CD, I can confirm it is actually a CD-R: the back of the disc is green. The label Irecords should have mentioned it; a CD-R has indeed a lesser value than a CD, mainly because it is more likely to have manufacturing defects and has a span of life of 4-5 years.What's more, the sound quality is not good, it sounds like there is no bass. The problem is that bass is one of the features of Kevin Yost songs. It's really too bad he did not stay with Distance or Guidance.I do not want to promote such an item and will not comment more on it. I think that not mentioning this is a CD-R is misleading advertisement, and selling it to Amazon and then to the customers at the price of a real CD is swindle. After the Trojan horses of Sony-BMG, these CD-Rs by Irecords keep unfortunately devaluating CDs."
3,Good unless Grandma is a psycho,"I thought this was a great book to buy as a gift for my mother-in-law when I was pregnant with her first grandchild. It is full of updated childcare tips as well as suggestions for how the grandparents can assist and support the new family without stepping on anyone's toes (advice my mother-in-law was in desperate need of). Unfortunately, the grandmother who received this book from me was offended and thought it best to wait to divulge this information until the baby was born and the sleep-deprived parents were unsure how to react. Apparently she knows everything... sadly she hasn't seen her grandson more than a handful of times and has yet to exhibit any kind of knowledge about children (although she tells me that my 4-month-old will soon be putting things in his pockets and I better check them when I do the laundry)."
3,Incomplete Crankshaft completely enjoyable,"It's a shame that this excellent strip isn't reprinted in its entirety in this collection. At times, it appears only one day's continuity is presented in a story arc that originally went on for a number of days. In future, it is to be hoped these collections will be complete - for Crankshaft is certainly worth it - as I'm sure Ed himself would tell you in no uncertain terms!"
5,Great Resource,This book covers the non-musical aspects of being a band director but could easily be used for orchestra or choir directors. An excellent book for beginning educators but I think a lot of experienced instrumental music teachers would learn from it as well. Highly recommend!
5,A Great Resources for Beginning Teachers,"This books covers a wide variety of topics that beginning music teachers will find helpful (not just band directors). There are ideas for evaluation, written out letters for parents, administrators and formats to follow for handbooks. A great resource if you are just getting started in the profession - one to add to your bookshelf!"
4,Keeps him busy!,I am always looking for new toys and items that are safe and keep my Senegal parrot busy. I attached it to the top of his cage and he hangs on the side of them and chews on the tops. I'm going to move them inside his cage next week and see if he has just as much fun on with them.
2,Vangelis is the composer here - NOT the performer,"The claims in other reviews here that this is the original soundtrack album, are utterly false. This is a compilation of music composed by Vangelis, but performed by unknowns - probably session musicians working for scale.Besides a few tracks from Chariots of Fire, the rest of the CD is a ""best-of"" compilation, with tracks from Antarctica, Opera Sauvage, and others. I suggest buying instead the real music - performed by Vangelis."
1,Horrid tribute album mix-up,"The album with the Catalog number #58438 is a horrid tribute album - just listen to the samples if you want to hear awful music. Unfortunately because of a horrible Amazon mix-up, reviews for this album have been mixed in with reviews for #800020 and #622 (which are just slightly different versions of the Vangelis original)so John Buie's spotlight review is incorrect. Fortunately this tribute album is no longer available at Amazon, but don't spend $36 for it scond-hand"
5,Great CD,"I had the pleasure of seeing Tony at the 2004 Fan Fair in Nashville, where he performed several songs from this CD. Tony has the potential to make it big in country music. My favorite songs on this CD are The Flower Picked Me and Brown Eyed Girl, but I like all the other songs almost as much! His voice is very pleasant to listen to and he just sings, pure and simple, without a lot of vocalizing like other artists. I don't buy many CD's, but I bought his right away and have played it many times in the the month I've owned it. I recommend you buy the CD and give this guy a chance! I guarantee you will become a huge fan."
4,Good book for those that are not self teachers,"A good bathroom read, but I was not super-impressed with this book. A lot of the information in this book is easily found online...if you are looking for it. That being said, If there are those of you who don't like doing your own research, this book is your god-send."
2,"No way 200,000 btu","This is a nice stove but there is no way it puts out the 200,000btu as stated maybe 65,000btu. Poor shaker grates"
4,Great heat output ... not epa,"I have this stove in a RV bus conversion. I designed round heat shield for stove and pipe to get min clearances near wood walls. I used stove pipe pieces (wrap around flat type) with copper pipe for the shield.I put a hole behind the stove with a screen and fan on a cooling thermostat. This gives positive pressure and better heat shield performance. I also made a screen for the open door area to check out the flame without getting embers blown out on the floor/eyes.I thing max output is more near 100,000 BTU ... but when it takes off it turns my place into a sauna ... 100 plus deg F when below freezing outside! You really need a stove pipe damper to keep this thing under control and extend burn times.The best part of this stove is the long logs/wood scraps that it fits .... 30 inches.My reason for 4 stars is that it needs a stovepipe damper and it is not epa cert.It is the best $300-$400 I have ever spent for comfort!"
3,Mighty Mule Replacement Battery,"I have my gate opener hooked up to a solar panel. Its a lightweight aluminum double gate with the main arm and slave arm. I have found in the area that I live that these batteries last about 8 months before needing to be replaced. I have read that you can get a regulator that will stop the solar from charging the battery constantly, thus prolonging the batteries life. For the price of the battery, I havent had a problem with replacing the battery as needed. Its a very quick and easy process to swap out the battery."
2,Short Life,"Purchased two replacement batteries 8/29/12, by 12/31/12 they were no longer working. I live in Colorado and as soon as the tempature drops below freezing, the batteries ability goes to zero. The original mighty mule batteries made ti through two winters, these didn't make it through one. If you live in warm climate these might work for you but if you live where it gets cold, look for another source. I replaced them with original batteries provided by Mighty Mule.Shipping was quick and they arrived when promised, it's unfortunate they just don't work in the cold."
1,Don't buy this book!!,The authors don't know anything about funding new ventures. The sample businessplan that is included should never get any funding from somebody that's not a complete idiot. After I bought this book I will never buy a book that doesn't have a customer commet.
1,A Bad Dream,"This is a book written by, or for, disturbed teenagers. It begins with the wonderful premise that the protagonist's parents have their heads blown off in a shopping mall.After a gratuitous train wreck, it devolves into an unbelievable story of a boy tramping about the woods, making a friend and dodging ""evil"" hunters. The hunters are made more evil by the fact that they sell parts of dead bears to a miscreant doctor.Good triumphs over evil, of course, but not without a pail full of pontification and teenage angst.The moral of this book? Beats me, but a shooter videogame version is sure to follow.Pity the child that reads this book."
5,His Dream Was To Go To Paris,"""In Search of Gold"" is a plainly written tale of a Minnesota pharmacist who is lured to the Copper River Valley of Alaska by the promise of gold. His dream is to eventually take his sour-faced wife to Paris and live happily ever after on his findings. But he was lucky to survive Alaska's Copper River Gold Rush of 1898. For one thing, there wasn't any gold. And the hardships of a totally unknown wilderness were almost enough to kill him. In 1898, many writers wrote in a flowery style that's hard to decipher nowadays. But Horace Conger is wonderfully concrete. This book was put together by his descendents, and is a classic in Alaska Gold Rush history."
5,An absolute must- for any wrestling fan's collection!,"I have been collecting wrestling memorabilia for many years and Lanny's book is my prized possession; not only for his genius poetry, but also the lavish illustrations by Lynne Gutshall make this book a viable keepsake for any wrestling fan."
2,Torn on how to rate this,"I'm not sure how to rate this product. 99% of the film is spectacular. Great insight into how these watches are made, interviews with leaders in the industry, awesome watches etc. 5 star material. But, there is a very small section in the middle of the film about an erotic/pornographic watch. This part is completely indulgent by the film maker - it's not important to collectors (at least this one). And, this very small section really tarnishes a wonderful work. It's just a shame. I'd love to be able to use this film to show other's (friends, family, etc.) why I'm attracted to mechanical watches - but, unfortunately, I can't."
4,Copy??,Does anyone want to sell or copy their copy of this DVD? I can't seem to find it for sale anywhere and am getting pretty frustrated.Thanks!!
2,"A ""Big & Tall"" coat. . . mostly ""Big"" rather than ""Tall""","I'm 5'8"" & weigh 165 lbs. I wear a size 42 regular suit coat & size 34 suit pants. Given these stats, the size chart said that I should order a large regular and I did.This is a very nice coat. Quality leather and nice liner.However, the coat is made for a giant hump-backed pear of a man.Though the shoulders fit and the length was right,the body of the coat was designed for someone with a very, very wide girth. Tony Soprano would disappear in the folds of this thing. I spent a chunk to have the massive tent like folds of the coat-body taken in. Also, standing up straight while wearing the coat causes a leather bubble just below the back of the collar to pop up. It looks like a huge water-cell on an old black dog. I had to spend more to have this built in ""hump"" removed as well."
2,Picture looked better,It is nice looking in the picture but upon receipt it was a little on the cheap cheesy side then the way it shows in the picture.
3,"This is a JC Penney house label ""Stafford"" leather sport coat.","This is a JC Penney ""Stafford"" house label leather sport coat. Stafford is JC Penney's house label for men's clothing. JC Penney routinely sells this leather sport coat for $99.00. My jacket still had the ""Stafford"" label sewn into it when it was delivered. The jacket is a good value for $99.00, but I do think that the seller should disclose that they are liquidating excess inventory for JC Penney."
2,A lot of hype,"I actually go to this dentist and was totally clueless about the whole case since I moved into the area not too long ago. I am an avid reader of crime drama and was excited to read a book that hits very close to home.This is one of the dryest books that I have ever read. The first chapter was pretty good, but then it's just blah blah blah. It took me almost 2 weeks to finish it, when I usually finish a book like this in a day or two.I have read other books by this author, but this one just doesn't match up to his other works."
2,No customer service from seller,"Hello all Final Cut Pro enthusiasts. I ordered the product from this seller and haven't recieved any customer support regarding some specific questions, no phone calls, no returned emails. After paying for the product with credit card, some simple follow up wouldn't be to much to ask when a customer/potential customer is contemplating a purchase (or has recently puchased the item)."
4,Helpful for the beginner,"Although I would have preferred a faster moving and more advanced tape, this Spanish instructional tape helped me strengthen my Spanish speaking and especially my listening skills. A great tool for a novice who is trying to learn Spanish, yet it also helped me, a student who has completed three years of Spanish, to better pronunciate my words."

5,This book is changing my life!,"This is not your ""try harder, think positive"" boring personal growth book. It's different and fascinating! Written in the format of a teaching novel, it takes you on a scuba diving adventure - into your very soul. If you want ""below the surface"" change in your life, read this book!"
3,"Ok, not great","I bought and read this book based upon a single customer review and wish to add my opinion to the mix. Good things: The character developement was fairly well done, and the story is unique. I personally like longer stories, so the length of the story seemed appropriate. Bad things: The story did get off to a slow start with a several hundred page description of the shore leave taken by a group of soliders. While many emotional bonds were made, I got sick of reading about all the drinking, eating, and sex. As a healthy male, that was easy to grasp and seemed beat to death. The technology of this fairly advanced society was not well described, nor were the political situations detailed... Finally, my biggest complaint is that the author used WAY too many exclamation points. Its weird, and I'm normally not a stickler for things like that, but it got annoying. In summary this is an average book which is unfortunately not worth its cover price."
1,Truly sad,". . . that I spent my hard-earned money on this software. The interface is confusing, and unlike the free player/burners you can download off the Internet, it offers no way to access track info on music CD's from the Internet.Kevin, Plano, TX"
5,ARRL Antenna Book,"Book is great, also in wonderful shape. Tons of valuable information inside.Thank You,TonyNashville, TN."
3,Very informative - but very technical!,"This is an ""OK"" reference for those looking for information on a variety of antenna's and applications. Having said that, it is way too technical. If one is looking for ""how to construct"" information, they would be better served looking at other publications that provide a more simplified approach. Most readers will be overwhelmed. I was looking more for practical construction guidance."
4,Good review,Covers the various antennas. I would liek to see more technical specifications and equations. Good antenna book.
5,Ham Radio Classic,"I got my first copy of the Antenna Book back in the 1980's when I was a young teenager who had just gotten his General Class license.It is a fantastic book, a must have for anyone who wants to understand how antenna systems work.The included software and book on disc are excellent.I wish it was a little less expensive, but it is not a purchase any ham should regret!"
5,This Is A Whopper Of A Book,"I cannot imagine an antenna subject on earth that is not covered here. As a fairly new ham with a General license, this book is a bit like taking a drink out of a firehose. It might be wise for the new ham to start with something a bit more basic. However, this appears to be the Bible for those wanting total coverage of the subject."
5,A must have,"The definitive book on antennas theory, design, and construction. If you're serious about building your own antennas then you need this book as part of your collection!"
5,Excellent. I love the music and sound quality.,I play this daily on both iPods and my stereo. Excellent bass and treble quality and I love Webber's music.
5,Easy Listening,"Perfect for light back round music. Perfect for listening in the car or rv. If you like easy instrumental music, you'll love it."
2,A little disappointing,"Being a lover of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, I had very high hopes for this album, however I found it very disappointed. It almost sounds very amateurish and is not engaging in the least."
3,For the Brady Bunch fan who has everything,"I bought this as something of a gag gift for a huge Brady Bunch fan. That is about all it is worth. Inexpensive, but I learned ""miniature editions"" does mean the book is really small. A cute little book, but don't expect to get much from the book in terms of Brady Bunch trivia."
2,Where is the man named Brady?,"This is a cute enough book, most likely intended for impulse purchases at book stores or card shops, full of quotes and pictures from the original series. But not one picture of Robert ""Mike Brady"" Reed in the whole book, even on the cover? It's especially bizarre when you see the familiar group pictures of the Bradys and Mr. Brady has obviously been cropped or digitally erased from the picture. Did his estate object to his image being used? Or did the publisher object to using images of a gay man even though he was an integral part of the show? I would hope that's not the case. There's no indication on the copyright page whether this is a licensed book or not. Either way it's ridiculous to have a book about the Brady Bunch without ""the man named Brady."""
5,"OUTTA SITE, CUTE BOOK!!!!! FAR OUT, GROOVY PHOTS!!!!!","THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!!IT TEACHES ALL OF THE LIFE LESSONS REFERRING TO THE BRADY EPISODES!!!! IT IS A VERY CUTE, SMALL BOOK THAT I CAN CARRY AROUND ANYWHERE!!!I LOVED IT AND I ENJOYED READING IT!!! I READ IT OVER 50 TIMES ALREADY!!! IF YOU DIDN'T BUY THIS BOOK ALREADY, YOU GOTTA GET IT!!!!"
3,where is Robert Reed?,"I loved the mini book and all the pictures, but was perplexed by the lack of Robert Reed pictured anywhere in this book. It makes you wonder if the author is anti-gay. The book would be so much better with pics of Mr. Brady!!!!"
3,Came in handy,"I used this little book while spending a couple of weeks in Greece. While I needed the assistance of English speakers for at least one sticky situation, between the little bit of Greek I learned from friends and this phrasebook, my companion and I got by pretty well. I particularly remember using it in a hotel where the owners didn't speak English, and again while talking with strangers on the phone.However, the book (at least the edition I used) has at least one major boo-boo: the phrase allegedly meaning ""Do you speak English?"" actually means ""Do you speak Greek?""! You can imagine the reactions you'd get with that mix-up, although most people would likely catch the error, as I did. Still, it does make me wonder what other errors I might *not* have caught . . ."
4,Authentic Kundalini,"I purchased this after reading the one and only review of this great DVD.This DVD workout is far superior to anything else I own.I have all of Ravi Singh and Anna Brett's DVD's, however they tend to be geared for the lower end of the scale. Nothing against them, they are very good, but after doing this DVD you will see where the differences lie.This DVD is not easy, but that is the point. You will build up to the work in time, so it is not a DVD one does three or four times, becomes bored to tears and then moves on to something else.I hope more people invest in this one."
3,"Good ideas, bad arrangement","Although this book has a lot of great ideas for activities, it could be arranged better. The activities are not organized according to topic or genre; instead the book is set up like a chart. There are a week's worth of activities on each two-page spread, with an introduction for each week's theme. However, if you're looking for a specific theme, you'll potentially have to check the index and jump from section to section to find it."
2,I did not care for this book...,"I did not like this book and it's layout. I think the concept of having an art project 365 days a year is great, but I think that the pictures were too small, and very hard to see. I am a 5th grade teacher who also is teaching art, so step by step instructions are always a winner for any teacher who is not an art teacher."
2,No good,The sack did not fit my sleeping bag even though the size chart on their website said it would. The quality was low with the stitching being weak. Spend the extra couple dollars and go with the Kelty brand sack.
4,Items of this kind are generally good--THIS review is of the page here...,"Wake up, Amazon!It would be REALLY HANDY for listings of this kind to INCLUDE specific size information about each of the stuff sacks. You list from ""small"" to ""xxxlarge"" without any easily accessible information about what these words mean, in internationally known and recognized measuring units. Minimally, I have two questions: What are the uncompressed diameters of each sack in cm? What are the lengths? (It would also be nice to read something about available straps for compression, too.) We simply don't know, and we can't find out. Without knowing, I won't order."
5,Fits a snuggie,"Okay, okay, okay... I know what your thinking. I am hardcore why do I need a sack for my snuggie?? Well let me tell you friend you haven't traveled if you haven't taken your ole trustySnuggie ZebraorThe Slanket Blanketalong for the ride. I bought the XS size (Extra Small) and while it took the strength of Samson to get that bugger in that sack, my GG Round rock took my beloved snuggie and turned that bad boy into a small lump of potato love. Now sure, I could probably use my Snuggie as a weapon now that it is compressed but really would you want to get hauled into court and have to explained why you assaulted someone with such a cozy blanket? Not me sir, not me.. Buy it now.. you won't regret that decision for whatever you want to stuff in them!"
1,wrong order,"As I said before- I tried to order the movie-DVD and instead unknowingly, ""ordered"" the poster. The poster is nice. I would be happy to mail it to anyone who would like it at no charge. Dr. Harrison"
2,don't buy this.,"this capo is not very good. it's already confusing trying to figure out how it goes on, and after awhile, the grip loosens so your strings start buzzing. get the kyser quick change capo instead."
3,Not as good as I remembered,I had bought one of these years ago and really liked the feel and sound compared the the shrub capos. The ones that I got this time still have that bright ringing sound but the quality is terrible. Still though they are good for a cheap capo.
3,hard to open but good,"The capo works well and i dont have any problems with buzzing on any strings. The only problem, and is a big one, is that it is SOOO difficult to take off your guitar. But the good thing about it is that, with just a squeeze, you can go up and down the neck of your guitar with ease. I would probably look for others, but just be warned, its hard to get off your guitar."
5,Obsessive Compendium of the Original Supes,An almost scholarly tome that I found myself reading sections from randomly when the mood strikes - this is surely a must for the fervent Superman fan and an interesting read for general comics aficionados.
3,Nice but size too big,"I chose size 6, but still big for me. (usu wear 6.) But they look much cuter than the picture. I love them so much. Though the size doesn't fit, I still keep them. Great quality."
5,Best series music,"""Bad things"" from True Blood (HBO) Sunday nights 9PM is the best song from a series this season.Bill K"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"it sounds like he just stopped trying to me. he used to be more subtle and complex, now he's just a mediocre coffeehouse folk troubadour. his voice doesn't even have any character anymore, he more speaks than sings. it's not like he experimented in any new directions, he just gradually lost everything that made him not bland."
5,Wonderful handbook,"I agree with both the previous reviewers. While there is a limit to what anyone can present in this limited format, this is really wondderful for participants and staff alike for any neopagan festival. Those who believe they're called to festival facilitation would do well to read how much of a life commitment this takes. Those who want to simply meet others, can look to discover what events really tug at the spirit-strings and have topics that support the soul. As the years go on it will become outdated but Singer has strongly encouraged double checking and using online resources to try and allay that problem."
1,I would not have purchased this item if I had been told that a step was needed.,Please include a better description of your work out videos and list necessary equipment needed. Since I don;t have a step and do not plan on purchasing one due to lack of storage space - this workout video cannot be tuilized as it was designed to be.
5,As Nice as Previous Seasons,"Like the previous five seasons, this one has the same physical look and layout, four episodes per disk, six disks full, and the last two episodes on the seventh, special features disk. I have to confess the purple of this box is probably my favorite colour, and it really looks nice stacked up with the other DVDs.They changed the clip format for this box set, choosing to go with one screen showing clips of the four episodes back to back. While this allows you to focus your attention on only one screen, it can also be annoying. Season six seems to be in heavy rotation on television, and if you've seen a lot of the episodes the wait can be annoying, but it's worth it."
1,Lame duck episode,"While I am a fan overall of the TNG series, this episode is not one I would recommend watching, even for the sake of completeness. Do yourself a favor and skip this episode."
3,sound track drags,The sound track drags so bad that the music reminds me of an old 8 track tape that got wet.But the show is great
1,Same problem as the others...,"Unfortunately, I have the same problem as the others. This video isn't available to watch, either as a Prime member or just on the instant video either. I even looked to see if there was paid option version for non-Prime members, but can't find it on Amazon. It's just one episode of the entire series, but sadly, it's a Part II of the first part, so it stinks to not be able to see the conclusion. Will definitely update my review once the video becomes available."
4,"Amazon, Y U no have Part 2?","This is great, but there's such a cliffhanger at the end and then it says part 2 is unavailable. Why is this? I mean,after all, we are paying for Amazon Prime, why can't we watch this one episode?"
2,"Love Star Trek, Bad Job Amazon","It appears that Amazon got the video off old VHS tapes that they left out in the sun to warp, then filmed a lousy TV screen to get the final image. The final episode of season 6 is especially bad with distortions in the sound for the entire first 10 minutes. Star Trek The Next Generation rocks, but the video here is terrible!"
4,TNG at it's most playful and darkest.,"While many took note that DS9's premire took a little wind out of the sixth season,TNG juggled with stories that ranged from Playful(Rascals,A Fist Full Of Datas),introspective(Tapestry,Lessons),suspenseful(Face Of The Enemy) to eerie (Man Of The People,Schisms).The highlight of the season was Relics,which James Doohan's Scotty returns after being in a transporter stream for 75 years.The best episode of the season is the two part Chain Of Command which has Picard re-assigned,then taken prisoners & tortured by the Cardassians.The season finale Descent,returning with a new Borg threat ends on a limp note(especially after Best Of Both Worlds Pt 1),but season six was definately an interesting experience."
1,Not available.,"Star Trek - Next Generation - Instant Video - This episode - Season 6 episode 17 is now unavailable. Yet, it's Part II to episode 16. So it's integral! It needs to be fixed - and made available. Amazon advertised that ALL STAR TREK episodes were available through instant video FREE with Prime. This one is not. Please fix. Thanks - Dave"
2,Unable to watch :(,"Like previous reviewers, I had a problem with the audio. However, the video was also unwatchable -- I refreshed and popped out the video multiple times, even tried different browsers, but most of the time, I'd either just get the Paramount splash (frozen), or a few moments of video before the splash returned. Not bad if I just want to *listen* (albeit badly) to the episode, but I can't actually watch it. A pity, because I remember this being a pretty good one. I have not had this issue with any previous episode using this browser (Chrome), so I'm assuming it's the video itself."
2,Bad Audio,"Show is great, but the audio is horrible. Like the previous reviewer, it sounds like the VHS player needs a new drive belt.. I quit watching."
5,Star Trek Next Generation season Six a great season!,"Just when I thought they could not improve over Kirk, Spock and the gang, they did. Season six is when they proved that they were their own Star Trek! Time's arrow alone is one of my fav's."
5,STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION 6TH SEASON,WAS GREAT RECEIVED QUICKLY AND ALL THE DVD'S WERE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION
2,Disappointing Technical Issues,If they had the entire season available . . .If the entire season would play without freezing . . . without dropping signal . . . without loss of connection quality . . .It would have been good.
4,As always - great,excellent series great characters I particulalrly like data. A Rodenbery masterpiece. I reccomend for evertybody on the planet earth todsy
5,Great with some more twists,Starts out with the second half of yet another cliffhanger involving a mystery centered around Data and alot of diferent kinds of plot twists and finishes up with one last clifhanger involving the Borg.
5,Tapestry Episode. Star Trek Writing at its Finest.,Star Trek Writing at its Finest. Each year I watch this episode as a complement to A Christmas Carol. There were many brilliantly written ST episodes and I would place this one among the very best.
4,The last great season of TNG,"Season six was the last great season of Next Generation; seven was just too uneven and lackluster, as the writers moved onto Voyager and Generations.Six resembles five in many ways; a number of classic episodes, plenty of good ones, and also a fair share of mediocrity. ""Change of Command"" and ""Tapestry"" are absolutely brilliant and worthy of mention as among the best in TNG's run. We also get ""Frame of Mind"", ""The Chase"", ""Ship in a Bottle"", ""Starship Mine"", ""Face of the Enemy"" and ""Timescape"". On the minus side of the ledger, there are plenty of episodes like ""The Quality of Life"", ""Realm of Fear"", ""Birthright"", and ""Aquiel"" - all with the common denominator of boredom.Worth it for most Trek fans. All good things..."
4,Good season,"I'm not a huge TNG fan, but wanted to add this to my collection. There are lots of good enjoyable episodes, and worth adding to your collection."
2,Inconvenient and incomplete,"If you seriously collect or sell Hull pottery, skip this book. Only the most expensive pieces have color pictures and valuations, but even for many of these you will only find small black and white pictures, and no valuations. Furthermore, almost 25% of the book is merely reprints from old Hull catalogs, with no valuations included. Valuations are inconveniently listed in the back of the book, which requires a lot of page flipping (very convenient for the publisher, who only has to update this section, rather than the entire book). I get the impression that this book was merely published to profit off the interest of collectors, but not really intended to serve the collector's needs."
3,"Book helpful, but hardly definitive",If I could purchase only one Hull reference it would be Jeffrey Snyder's Hull Pottery: Decades of Design. The Roberts book uses color photos that look they were taken in the 1950's and in at least one case I was unable to ID a piece because of the graniness of the photo. She does include some pieces Synder's book does not and vice versa. I have found using one book to supplement the other the best bet.
3,VERY POOR PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE PASTEL ITEMS...,"I BOUGHT THE BOOK TO IDENTIFY THE HULL VASES WHICH I'VE COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS, BUT I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I OPENED THIS BOOK. MANY OF THE ITEMS WERE ALMOST UNIDENTIFIABLE, DUE TO WASHED OUT PHOTOS OF THE PASTEL ITEMS - AND THE PASTELS ARE THE ONLY HULL ITEMS WHICH I OWN. I WAS HARD-PRESSED TO BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. THE YELLOWS, PINKS, GREENS AND LIGHT BLUES ARE SO PALE, AS TO NOT BE ABLE TO TELL WHERE ONE COLOR ENDS AND THE OTHER BEGINS. IN MANY PHOTOS, THERE IS ALMOST AN ABSENCE OF COLOR - EVERYTHING IS JUST A BLUR. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE NUMBERS ON THE BOTTOMS OF THE VASES I OWN, I'D NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM - CERTAINLY NOT BY THE PICTURES. REALLY POOR EDITING. THOSE PHOTOS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REJECTED AND RE-DONE."
4,Great Resource/Information,"I purchased this book to help me identify a Hull piece that I recently acquired. Unfortunately, this book did not contain information about my pottery, but the book proved to be a wealth of information. I am NOT disappointed! Great pictures and a great guide!"
4,"For the price, it does pretty well","It looks nice, not cheapy plastic like some are. It's not extremely bright, but it is enough to light a small statue. It stays lit most of the night if not all night. I happened to check it at 4 am and it was still lit. I am very happy with it."
3,Good Enough,"I ordered these for my backyard. They look better than most of the Rock-Lights in the category so full credit to them on that, assuming you believe a Rock can have a small solar panel in it. I installed them around my backyard which ranges from good sunlight to tons of sunlight. The ones installed in the part shade / part sunlight area stopped working after a couple of days. I moved all lights to the middle of the backyard where they get tons of sunlight and problem solved. Note: I live in San Diego, so not sure in a cloudy area like Seattle how well these would work."
3,Not too bright.,The rock looks nice and is very sturdy but the light is not very bright. It gets sunlight for most of the day but the light is very dim at night. It does seem to stay on most of the night.
2,Ok for price,I was very pleased with the look of these and for the first few days they were bright and worked well in the application that I was using. I've had them almost a month now and neither one is working anymore
4,"Works fine, as expected.","This solar rock works fine.It doesn't hide itself (i.e. it looks more like a lamp than a rock), but I wasn't expecting anything different.It's not a particularly large rock lamp, but, it lights up with a decent amount of brightness--particularly for a smaller lamp.Compared to some other solar rock lamps, this is a good value."
3,Not Very Bright,These are ok....The one good thing is that they still work. I've had them about a month or two. I just wish they were brighter.
3,This is the second rock I have purchased,"These rocks don't seem to last very long - well, about 1 year but when they work, it's good for me. I have it shining up on my address sign on the front lawn. It's good for someone looking for your address, easy to spot. However, I would like a little brighter light."
2,"10"" or 12""......Help me out here!!!","The title describes the wheels as being 10"", but in the product description they claim to be 12"". We ordered this for a Genrac 4000XL Generator. With a little welding and soldering, my husband managed to make it fit properly. The wheels sure beat dragging that thing around. We would have been a lot happier had the description accurately described the product!!"
2,Pedantic First-Person Narrative Buries the Lead,"I checked this book out from the e-library to try to steer toward writing brief, readable technical proposals. This book tries to psychoanalyze your potential customer and tries to do it in a patronizingly role-playing way. I couldn't get through even a paragraph without feeling annoyed.There may be some valuable points buried in the pedantry. However, I don't have time to filter for them, especially since this is a book about *writing*. I'm looking for another resource."
1,Too basic to reduce to writing.,The tables and diagrams are confusing and too busy. The pyramid concept (having an objective in mind and actually assembling a document to support the objective) could have been written by a college sophomore. The advice given is so basic; I wondered why anyone would even bother to reduce it to writing.
5,What a Value!,"Of all the textbooks I've needed to buy, this was the best value. $1.99 in excellent condition. I always start at amazon.com for my textbooks because they usually have the best prices."
2,Missing Important Stuff,"This book is all right, but it's missing some key parts. For example, it says nothing about reading RFPs. There isn't a chapter on budgets or costs. It says nothing about document design or using graphics in proposals.Moreover, it's written in a condescending tone that gets annoying after about page 5.If you want a comprehensive book on the subject, look at Writing Proposals by Johnson-Sheehan"
5,An Author Responds,"Since my book is mentioned in a couple of these reviews, I thought I would respond.I used Rich Freed's book for years in my consulting practice and MBA classes. It's a great book, and I *highly* recommend it. It's clearly one of the best treatments on writing business proposals available.But comparing my book on proposals to Freed's is like comparing apples and oranges. My book is aimed at people who work in scientific and technical disciplines. Freed's book is written toward business applications. These two books are designed to work in two completely different arenas.Buy this book. As an experienced proposal writer and consultant, I believe it's the best book on writing business proposals. It's truly innovative, and it offers wonderful strategies for winning contracts in highly competitive business environments."
3,A little less than adequate,"The case is definitely a hard case, but the sleeves are so snug that you have to hold the case down to pull out the CD. I was hoping to use this case to carry my CDs when I DJ, since the hanging sleeves and index tabs make for good organization, but taking the CDs out is just too difficult for quick use.If you're just looking for something to store DVDs or CDs for leisurely use, it's a great product."
2,Not what I thougt I was getting,"I got this in the mail today and the picture on amazon shows all of the fittings for a normal pressure washer. You have to go out and buy the fittings to use this with normal pwashing tips. Also, it was't coated in the yellow rubber as pictured. Really disappointed in what I got, and not what I thought I was getting thanks WTF"
3,P21S,"I thought this product will be at higher strength but seems like any other average cleaner you can get at the store. I mean it does the work. If you looking for something stronger, go for the higher stength cleaner."
5,A god send for white wheels.,"I purchased this kit from a local auto detailing boutique as suggested by the employee. I have white wheels and am still stuck with MINI OEM brake pads (they dust A LOT!), so they're kind of hard to keep clean. I was able to put 2-3 sprays of this stuff straight onto the supplied sponge and easily wipe an entire 17in 12-spoke wheel clean. I was amazed. I like that the bottle is reusable so when I run out I can just buy the liquid in bulk.(Note: It doesn't do to well with tar, I got stuck behind a tar truck and literally had chucks of tar stuck to my wheels and had to use a dedicated tar/bug remover to get them off.)"
2,Not a good value,Got about three washes out of the bottle .. still had to resort to a lot of elbow grease.. it works but not worth the price
1,$115 for what???,"Oh hell no! I loved the series, but not for 2 seasons at $115. What idiot came up with that price? So when all seasons come out do they really think people are going to pay $1,000 for a 70s tv show? I don't think so."
1,PRICE IS CRAZY,I REALLY wanted this series but I am in SHOCK at the price for this series. They would sell if they were affordable. WHEN and IF they ever price this correctly they will sell a lot of this series.
2,Price Not Right...,"I was in shock when I saw the price for two seasons of Love Boat series. I cannot understand why this is so high, but probably due to the licensing...so many actors involved, and they aren't cheap...I hope to see this entire series complete someday, with more reasonable pricing. I will certainly buy it then, as I loved this show."
1,High Price,"I love the Love Boat, buy I agree with everyone else, it is priced way too high. I really do want the series, but am very reluctant to pay so much."
1,Too expensive!!,"Hmmm. I'm very surprised they are charging so much, let alone ""splitting"" the seasons into 'vol 1' and vol 2' (that really sucks!) - Sounds a bit too pricey for me.... think I'll wait."
1,Way to expensive,What are they thinking charging over $129.00 for 2 seasons of the Love Boat. I liked the show but at that price they can keep it. West Wing has all 7 seasons and extra discs for under $90.00 Come on Love Boat people get with the program lower the price and but all the seasons in 1 boxed set.
1,Good Grief,"First of all... put the seasons in full, on a disk. This half-season stuff is ridiculous. Secondly, are you FREAKING serious about the price? I'd rather chew glass then be robbed that blatantly. Shame on you! I'll wait until it either comes out on Blu-ray or at LEAST singled disk per season and with an unlaughable price tag attached. Good grief. Unbelievable."
1,Insane price,"Wonderful series, but who on earth decided on the price for this box? Not even the greatest fan of the series should buy at such an unreasonable sum. My suggestion, wait for a complete box set for a normal amount, or leave it be. A disgrace to treat such a great series, and the fans of it, with such disrespect. Do they really want to sell any, with this price I wonder."
1,Terrible writing,"Hard to get thru because of bad writting style. Also, to much name calling and not enough hard facts. I was looking for an unbiased work and instead recieved the opposite."
1,PETA actually MAKES positive changes!,"PETA is a wonderful organization and thanks to them, so many positive things have happened for animals. Whomever wrote this book should be ashamed and embarrassed for putting down an organization that works so hard for animals."
1,A big yawn!,"The bottom line: What's wrong with caring for all beings on this planet? Before you chow down on that drumstick, think good and hard about where it came from.Have some mercy people and for once, think beyond yourself!"
5,Very beautiful,"Was a little bit surprised that there's only 7 pieces. Oh well, I probably didn't read the description close enough. The paper is beautiful, very happy about it."
5,Beautiful!,These are one of the most beautiful origami paper ever! They have a texture that make them have a 3D effect on them. The designs are exceptional and make my heart flutter!
5,"If you have ADD, you need to watch these videos.","Dr. Kevin is nothing short of amazing when it comes to his work with individuals, particularly those with ADD. He presents a compelling viewpoint which is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the perspective on ADD."
4,compact good sholder strap and a bit heavy,"This is my first canvas bag cooler, picnic st so take my review at what it is. The bag did feel a bit heavy of being empty except for plates and silverware. But it looks great. The food storage looks good it has a liner and it is removable for a bit more space. The glasses are a bit small."
5,Malibu Picnic Basket,"Everything we expected in a picnic basket. Quality of this picnic basket is on the high end and is very durable. First time we used it, another couple in our group had the same one."
3,Mirror on America: Short Essays and Images from Popular Culture,Mirror on America: Short Essays and Images from Popular CultureIt was fast then I expected and faster then all the other books I ordered.
3,Sexy Scottish hero and forbidden passion - who could ask for more...?,"Though the sensuality rating is a bit tepid for my taste, it's still a sweet read.Back of the book synopsis:Ewan Geddes, exiled from his home in Scotland to America, reads of Tessa's engagement in the newspaper. Having grown up as a servant to the Talbot family, Ewan recalls the young girl that epitomizes beauty to him. Now that he has made his fortune in the new world, he finds himself in a position to take possession of the things that have eluded him: A beautiful bride and acceptance in the society that fought to hold him down as a youth.Although reconciled to spinsterhood, Claire finds herself once again stepping in to protect her flighty step-sister from herself. Claire and her stepmother plot to have Claire distract Ewan from his prize and determine if his motives are true, unaware that he has amassed his fortune in America. What Claire doesn't reckon on are her own suppressed feelings for the handsome highlander."
3,Wimps wailing about wimps,"net slaves starts with a decent premise...profiling the caste system found in the technology sector (the focus being on PC-based hardware/software firms). The writers select a representative person from each of the 10 castes to profile (taking considerable literary license on the last profile when they were unable to actually interview a CEO). This leaves the reader wondering just how much of the book is fiction and how much non-. If this was the authors' 'big idea', then one wonders what else they have in mind."
4,Great book for all of us Web working people!,"NetSlaves made me laugh hysterically... and I also identified so much with most of the people, I took notes (so I'd know how to deal with MY boss). It's definitely worth reading, and you'll get through it very quickly."
2,amusing and annoying,"As has been said in many previous reviews, the decision to fictionalize the names of companies and players was just stupid. Why bother? But no one has pointed out the worse journalistic flaw -- the repeated use of recreated dialogue and ""scenes"" that the authors couldn't possibly have witnessed firsthand. Yes, I found the tales interesting but the clumsy use of fiction-writing techniques spoiled my enjoyment immensely. There's a great book about real life in the trenches of the Internet, post-1994. This isn't it."
2,Disappointed,"I found some of the sections in this book to be pretty disappointing. The ""Priest and Guru"" section was awful, ditto the ""Gold Digger"" section. I don't know why they went to all the trouble to disguise the names of companies involved - Jeez, it doesn't take a genius to know they're talking about Microsoft, Prodigy, Intel, IBM, et al. Overall, I was very disappointed by this book. Po Bronson does it better."
2,Outdated and coy,"This book is out of date, and I found the authors' habit of using aliases for companys and people and jobs (Aggro Software for Microsoft, Pfeiffer for Bill Gates, etc.) annoying and pointless. There's also a coy, sly tone to the whole thing and the stories don't feel universally applicable. Go read GIG: AMERICANS TALK ABOUT THEIR JOBS AT THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM instead."
2,A little dissappointing,"I really thought the cover and theme promised a little more than the book delivered. They change the names of companies involved but give descriptions which narrow the possibilities, often to only one company. Perhaps they pulled some punch because of this. Would have liked more quick, punchy stories instead of longer sparser ones.Takes on a new resonance now that the bloom is off the internet rose."
2,Hard Work & Disappointment Not Restricted to the Internet,"A bitter book about bitter people by bitter people without the wit or courage to call Microsoft by its real name. The book's driving thesis seems to be that the Internet has a monopoly on low pay, bad management, hard work and injustice."
3,Not bad but a bit dated...,"As someone who's worked in the dotcom industry,I can't help but sympathize with the authors. However,someone made a good point in an earlier review:these guys,like myself,were willing participants. Promises of fat IPOs,100% turnover on ROIs and constant flow of fresh content/product are almost always a bad sign of any dotcom startup. At the time,it seemed like an inpenetrable plan. However,when my boss started doling out paychecks that were from his personal bank account,suffice it to say I got a bit worried. The book is accurate in a lot of ways on the rise and fall of working in the internet biz,but its ""inside scoop""becomes dated as we only have to turn on MSNBC to see which dotcom is closing up shop. It's a quick read,does give you insight on the day to day of the biz but ""Netslaves""is really just a precursor to what is now de rigeur(sp) in the internet biz."
3,"Some moments, basically fluffy","NetSlaves is fun to read and there are stories both funny and sad. Utimately, it is mostly a pathetic rant against corporate life. I am not certain what the point is but it seems like the laments of people playing the role of victim.This is not the 21 century 'Grapes of Wrath' so these comparisons are silly.With all of that said, the last story about the inner-city kid is very touching."
2,Barely worth the read,I looked forward to reading this book and I imagined it to be full of interesting stories. Instead there are only a handful of drawn out bad luck tales about self-destructive loosers willing to work for sadistic bosses. This is a history lesson that points out the extreme exceptions. There are more interesting stories to tell.
2,Just not that great of a book,"The premise holds promise, but this book just doesn't deliver. Changing the company names just gets annoying, but you get the feeling that the authors thought it was ""cute"". The stories themselves aren't very compelling, and the quality of the writing just isn't enough for me to call this a ""good book""."
1,NetSlaves -- Misleading and Disappointing,"Hyped as some insiders' view of the new Net workplace, ""NetSlaves"" provides a limited view of a limited number of people. Most of these people are NOT related to the Web or the Net of the late 90's. As such, the book is completely irrelevant.The annoying manner of slightly changing or disguising company names just adds to the impression that many of the stories are totally fiction (but still not entertaining).If you're looking for a funny, timely book about real people working in web development, maintenance, support, marketing, etc. -- look elsewhere. You'll be disappointed with ""NetSlaves."""
4,A surprisingly good read,"When I bought this book, I half-expected a protracted whine. It didn't turn out that way. The book is a series of humorous and well-written vignettes of life at all levels of the Internet economy. Even if you're not a net.geek, it's worth a look.The main negatives are that authors lean on argot a little heavily in spots, and don't hide their anger at the New Media system. This doesn't prevent the book from being quite enjoyable as a pleasure read, and in fact merely sharpens their wit. It's at least as good as many of the NYT bestsellers I've read."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"A fun, entertaining ride through the first days of a new world. With characters that bring to life elements of the new media experience, this book manages to personalize a largely technical topic. I enjoyed it!"
4,"Good, but not necessarily real life","Personally I don't fit into any of the ""castes"" that are described. While I'd take this as a sampling of the people who've been burned, the stories of success on the web number far greater. This book should be treated as the exception, rather than the rule. Overall though, a nice book!"
4,Not as funny as on the web,"I was really excited when I received Net Slaves for my birthday-- as someone who's been working in the Internet world since it became commercial, I'd nearly hurt myself laughing the first time I saw the Net Slaves web site.Parts of the book are still just as hysterical, but there were some weird changes-- I don't understand why ""Gold Hustlers and Sharks"" became ""Cowboys and Card Sharks"" or why they took the focus in that chapter off the consultants-- it was much funnier the other way.And while some of the personal stories were interesting and appropriate, others were a little too too in the easily identifiable company names.Anyhow, I think for someone who hadn't read the stuff on the web (which had set my expectations really high) that the book might not be disappointing at all. But for me, not as good as I expected."
3,A different book,"The book is a solid 3 star, suited for readers looking for a light overview of the cyber industry's employees (makers and breakers). The author's avoid the technical gibberish and concentrate on the lives of the people making it work (or break). I don't believe that it is a MUST READ, but rather more suited for a liesure reader looking for a few laughs and an inside look at the irony behind all of today's big corporations."
2,Handy/sturdy carrying case.,"Had previously purchased the canvas version, but that started to wear early and quickly. Thought this would be sturdier. One of the shelves was bend and we could not straighten out and the clasp did not 'fasten' securely. When my son tried to 'pack' the item full, the weight would eventually pop the cover open. But if your kid likes Thomas this is a great addition to the collection. Hopefully improvements are on the way."
2,Thomas Train Case - a little bit weak,"We were a little disappointed in this case because it isn't very durable. My little boy has a lot of the die cast trains and about filled the case. Within the first couple of days, the latch broke off. Luckily, my husband is really handy and he fixed it with stronger rivets on the latch. But, it broke right off of the case, rendering it useless unless you can fix it."
5,A good night's rest for little choo choos,I read a lot of the reviews for this item and either they have changed what it is made out of or other children are monsters! I have had no problems with this case. My son loves to line his trains up inside and it makes putting them up and getting them out much easier. My only complaint is that it is not big enough to hold them all! =)
3,Train Suitcase,"My 3 year old was so excited about his new ""train suitcase"" but when we filled it up with all his trains it became rather heavy for him to carry. Since the case is made of metal, it hurts really bad when he dropped it on his foot, has a few dents in it from banging it on the hardwood stairs as he carries it to his room and took out a little chunck of drywall as he rounded the corner too fast with it. Great concept - it keeps all his trains in perfect order - just wish it would have been hard plastic."
3,Great item if only it was better quality,"Well, now this carry case is a goner. The latch will no longer close and the top rim is hopelessly bent. It was fun while it lasted."
3,Could be better.,This case is a neccessity if you purchase multiple trains. It gives you a space to store them in. I have bought two for my grandson. He broke the clasp on the first one. It did last for a year. I just wish they would make a sturdier case. The concept on this one is great - but the case is flimsy (especially for a young child). It bends and dents so readily. Please Thomas give us a better carrying case.
3,Thomas Train Cases will do for now.,"Yes, the train cases are made of thin metal. They could be priced a little better than what they are. They do bend easily and the latch does come off. But until the Thomas people come up with something better, this case organizes both my sons trains for the time being."
3,EXTREMELY BENDABLE,"My son has a huge collection of Thomas Trains;hence, we were eager to purchase a carrier. Be prepared to continually bend the carrier back into shape just inorder to close the lid. The separations bend out of shape easily as well. Since you can bend it back, and it isn't to costly I give it three stars. Hope this was helpful."
1,Thomas Trains do not fit in case,"The wooden Thomas the Tank Engine trains do not fit in this case. The case is way to small for the trains to fit in. I would not recommend anyone buying this item. It is just a brightly painted metal box, that doesnt serve any useful purpose. The manufactor should be ashamed for false advertising."
2,piece of junk,"I gave this to my son for his birthday. The good news is that he loved it. The bad news is that it broke in less than an hour and he's very upset. He doesn't tend to break toys, ever, and he wasn't playing rough with it - just opening and closing. Buy something else; this is a piece of junk."
1,You can skip this one,"Maybe there was pressure to get another book out fast. This was the first of hers I'd read - it is without doubt weaker than the five I've seen since. Over the mountain is a set of cardbord cut-outs. Everybody is either an inbred racist hick bee farmer, or a worthless racist biker or wannabe. There is nothing interesting or compelling about any of them. Back in town, you have the cheap constructs. First, Peter's Army buddy with the wooden leg that must be filled with all the booze and drugs he took in thirty years of marginal living because he can't handle reality. When Peter has problems in his conversion training, the Rabbi just happens to save the moment with a story from his Concentration Camp days. I realize now that this fact was presented in an earlier book. Neither plot line ends up in an interesting or novel way. It seems like after a certain number of pages you are told what happened. Most of her other books are so much better..."
3,Character development getting better.,"In this the third in the series, Rina is in New York considering Peter's marriage proposal. As with her first two books, I find Kellerman's portrayal of Jewish rituals wonderful and informative. However, as far as Peter's conversion to Judaism - he can't just do it for somebody else, he has to want to do it for himself -- and I just don't get the feeling that he is 100% into it, even though she does end up accepting his proposal. As far as Peter's case, in his effort to find the parents of a two-year-old girl that he found wandering the streets in the middle of the night, he stumbles across a quadruple murder. The author made it very easy not to have any sympathy for any of the homicide victims. The book is well written, but unfortunately trying to follow Decker's work life and trying to follow Decker's personal life is like reading two separate books. The storylines are running parallel to each other, and the two just don't mesh."
2,harem,this show is not worth watching twice...it is so so....not real bad but not real good either....watching it once was enough for me...
3,Not for everyone,Im not sure if this has really helped much. I still get hot flashes. Maybe not as intense. I usually take 1-2 daily.
5,Controls flashes,"I am pre-menopausal and have suffered from flashes for a couple of years. I only take one of these per day, and it controls my flashes."
4,The best,As the third season of TNG started we found that the series had become something similar to the orginal since we find the the next generation of enterprise characters to be their own characters instead of the orginal TV series characters spin offs. A must have season for all trekkie fans
4,TNG Comes of Age in Season Three,"Star Trek: The Next Generation moved from puberty into growing adolescence in Year Three with the maturing of the prime characters, the change in uniforms and the standardization of much of the ship's functions and sounds -- without denegrating the story lines in any way. So much was gained and, no matter who or what the cause, episodes such as ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and ""The Offspring"" proved the growth that Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner brought to their characters, which continues through Year Six. Well worth the purchase price!"
4,My Nostalgia Fix,"I grew up watching Star Trek TNG. Now as an adult, I really enjoy seeing these episodes again. The DVDs are great because you can watch as many as you want with no commercials. It's fun to see the ""special effects"" from that decade compared to what we have these days.The DVD menus are easy to use with 4 episodes per disc. They are shown in order of air date, but the episodes are not always numbered in order. (Example: On the first disc, the first episode is 150, the second episode is 149) There are some special features on an additional disc, like behind the scenes production featurettes and interviews with the cast and crew. The last episode of the season is a Part One, which means I'll be getting the 4th season soon...My only complaint is with the packaging. Maybe someday they will come up with a way to package 7 discs without making it 2+ inches thick. I have a hard time fitting it on my DVD tower. The first 3 seasons take up more than 6 inches."
4,Stng 3rd season,If you don't love Star Trek and hate it then I can't understand why anyone would hate it.
2,Amazingly poor quality,"I am actually watching disc 6, second episode and I must say that the picture and sound quality is really bad (getting worse by the disc it would seem). The DVDs do not look any better than what I saw on TV the first time those episodes aired! You also occasionally have sweeping horizontal bars from bottom to top of the screen and the soundtrack volume sometimes goes down. I use a brand new iMac 24"" to view those DVDs. And truth be told, I found the quality of the Rat Patrol first season DVD set to be superior to ST:TNG considering the fact that The Rat Patrol was the very first color show broadcasted on ABC, in 1966. Expect of course the ""new special collector digitally enhanced remastered"" version (with tons of extras naturally) of those DVD sets soon because that is the Paramount way... suck them trekkers dry! I also bought season 4 which I will view eventually but I don't expect any better than season 3. Laters ;-)"
5,Simply the Best,"This is the season that started it all, the year a half-hearted imitation of a legend began building it's own legacy. From the feature film quality episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" to the mind blowing cliff hanger finale of ""Best of Both Worlds"", the third season of TNG had it all. It turned my friends and I from occasional viewers into die hard fans. You can shell out the money for the first two seasons if you have to be a completist, but you really only need to start with this set to have the best of what sci-fi on television has to offer."
5,star trek next generation-third series.,"I know that the series is excellent on tape anyway, and i just know that the sound affects and picture quality are going to be excellant. My husband is a very serious star trek fan and has series 3 on tape. But he is now trying to collect then on dvd,as and when we have the money."
1,For God's sake,If you need to get a Star Trek buy Deep Space NINE or wait for Voyager. Your best bet is to get the Farscape sets or Babylon 5. I have to admit Wesley Crusher is a great character!!! LOL
5,Unparalled Research Into Legibility,"Wheildon refocuses the question of legibility onto how much the reader remembers. This is retention: the only thing that can be scientifically measured and the one thing that cannot be ignored when serving your clients. Wheildon interprets this information to disprove some typographical rules, but he lays down new rules that are often overly simple. He leaves no room for styling that might support the words or for visual appeal. The book will help you understand how much is lost if you allow style to dominate the copy and it has some penetrating insights into how we read."
4,Scientific Research of Comprehensibility,"This book reveals the results of extensive research that tries to demystify ""comprehensibility"", as Wheildon calls it. Most of the conclusions in the analysis only apply to reading material with long-running text. Armed with this caveat, the reader can learn a number of very useful facts about reading behaviour, and what effects different attributes of a page have on the average reader.Wheildon's tone can be annoying, but the book is an easy read, and also serves as a reference."
5,Guidecraft 1st Impressions Clothes Tree,"Great item. Clothes tree made of solid wood construction, very easy to put together, just screw in a couple pieces and you are done! May be used as a clothes/coat rack; but we use to to hang all our dress-up and pretend play clothing."
2,It's only 24 min's long,"It's only 24 minutes long, all the many commercials before hand are probably longer than the ""feature"" presentation."
3,"A secular, robotic Christmas","Christmas takes on a post-modern twist in this video companion to television's popular Rolie Polie Olie animated series. I'll admit being charmed by the concept of ""Clanky Claus"" and the revised ""Twas the Night Before Christmas.""But I can see how the complete secularization of this holiday might offend some parents. (Not kids... kids love this video!) Jingle Jangle Eve?"
2,Hard to follow,"I purchased this book to find out more about decorated stoneware. This book is basically a haphazard listing of pieces that were auctioned off at different auctions. The descriptions are not always above or below an item. Sometimes they are very hard to follow.The prices are the actual auction price. No information on how to tell where a piece is from, that is not marked. No easy way to read this book."
5,HILARIOUS!,"This is the funniest book! I ordered several to give as gifts. Every time, it was a hit with the recipient whether they were of Italian heritage or not!"
3,"not ""italian"", just silly","i'm not sure why i'm the first to comment that this book is 80% universal body language (demonstrated by colorful italian characters)/20% actual italian body language/hand gestures. if you want to laugh at 'translations' of a man holding his stomach and grimacing (""italian"" for ""i ate like a pig!""), or holding his nose (""italian"" for ""you stink!"") then buy this book. if you don't know what a woman rolling her eyes with a dreamy expression means (in ""italian"" --""he's a hunk"") or how to say ""don't touch me"" in ""italian"" (point your ever-handy wooden spoon at someone and flare your eyes), then get this book. the few actual italian hand gestures are ok but there aren't many."
4,Great Party Favor,I have bought several of these books for my Italian friends. Lots of laughs. Enjoy!
4,Does what it is supposed to,"I bought this to do some labeling on my low voltage wiring. Works as advertised, just too expensive for what it is (thus 4 stars). This size works perfect for cat5e wiring. It is a snug fit, but does fit."
3,Enjoyable but nothing new,"Ms. Grant writes a sound story, but it is nothing I haven't read before. The romance element is strongest with main characters you will cheer for. Secondary characters, with the potentinal to really pop, are a bit thin. The world Ms. Grant creates is a bit underexplored and the villian in the story could have played a more interesting role. The opening sequence of the novel is wonderful and overall the book is a fun read. If you enjoy space-faring romance, this is a book for you."
3,A good adventure-romance,"There is no doubt that this book has a great, original, story line. It's action-packed plot and mature characters make for a nice change from your common romantic novels. Jas and Rom form a well matched couple whose relationship and adventures kept me glued to the pages. So why three stars only? Well... For one, I like the presence of sexual tension between the two protagonists, and this, I did not find here. Second, I was slightly dispointed with the ending. After presenting Jas as a strong female lead, she was left in the background for the last bit of the action which was not described. Thus, I found myself wishing for an other 50 pages, in which both Jas and Rom partake in a big finale.Overall, The Star King is a book I thouroughly enjoyed, and I would recomend it, especially if you are getting bored with the common formula found in most romantic novels. However, I don't think I will include it to my 're-read' pile."
3,Overall a Typical Read,"Although I will probably try Ms. Grant's other books, I can only classify this one as decent. The romance seems flat at times, even though the characters are at least passably interesting. There are some refreshing ideas thrown into the mix of standard fare, though the plot line takes some typical outlandish leaps. On two occasions I groaned at cheesy scenes within the romance, and one of the dogfight sequences found me laughing though the author never intended humor.In short, this is an easily read story with a typical plot and an under-developed romance with potential. My recommendation would be to buy it used."
3,Average Furturistic Romance,"...I ordered the book hoping to find an exceptional read. What I found was a book with a couple of neat ideas, likeable characters, decent sex/romance scenes, dull superficial plot, bad pacing, and actions so hard to swallow I throw the book down in disgust a couple of time and only reluctantly managed to complete it. In other words, your typical futuristic romance..."
5,"Great Story, Great Romance, Great Characters","This is a great romance and a great science fiction story. The universe beyond earth as described by the author is imaginative and fascinating. I love the premise of an adventerous woman seeking passage on the first space vessel to have contact with earth. The characters in the book are mature adults (no lame empaths or mystical healing heroines in this sci fi story) who are able to work out their problems by discussing them. The heroine is intelligent, thoughtful, and can rescue herself. And the hero is everything a romance reader wants in a hero - commanding, gentle, respectful, and hot. This is a fascinating, fun-filled adventure - a very satisfying read. I easily rate this book 5 stars. It is part of my keeper collection! If you like sci fi romance, don't pass this gem up."
4,Great!!!,"I really enjoyed reading a science fiction story that was true to life. We would all like to hope there is life beyond this galaxy and this story makes it believable. The other life beings are similar, just more advanced in their technology. And, best of all, I enjoyed reading about characters who had some life experiences prior to meeting each other. It gets very old reading the same story about 18 to 24 year old women and about 30 year old men ... I had already read her ""Once a Pirate"" and am VERY glad that I didn't miss this one! I will be SURE not to miss any of her future books!!!"
3,Average,"I've heard better. Not sure if its because I'm used to another style, but I find accents and phrasings very misleading especially if its meant for the beginner.What I feel is beginners need a steady tempo and not one that's only stylistically correct in the music sense. The waltz style and other expressions used here may confuse the beginner dancer who's already trying really hard to get the steps right...what more struggle with rhythm?Nice expressive playing though. Recommended for beginners with some kind of music background."
1,"OK price, bad quality","PRO)1) The card installed fine and the software was easy to use.CONS)1) Price-in light of the fact that for a little more money, you can get good quality.2) Quality-Just touching the box or speaker cables made the speakers pop.3) Quality, worse-Sound during movies would start off fine but after 20 or 30 minutes, the sound would begin to pop and crackle and get more and more distorted. The only way to fix this is did- and re-connecting the USB connection...repeatedly throughout the movie.OVERALLFound this in a store for $40. Thought it was a great deal for upgrading my laptop's sound and get some surround-sound out of my 4.1 speaker system. I didn't want to spend the $80-$100 on the Audigy PCMCIA card. I couldn't find any reviews of this product online before buying it, so I hope to do everyone a favor. Don't buy this product; it has terrible quality. The only good-quality USB 5.1 sound card for under $50 I've read about online AND EXPERIENCED is under my other reviews."
3,Another more complete version,"There is another version of this video. It is called ""The Word"" by USA Home Video, and it has two tapes in a pack with 188 minutes in a full length feature film (according to the box)."
1,Waste of Time,I can't believe that my wife and I spent three hours watching this tripe. The acting is ho hum and the plot is unimaginably stupid. It doesn't hang together in the least. The rationale for people's actions are never explained and the ending is totally unbelievable. David Janssen was far too old to be the 'babe magnet' dnd seducer his character was meant to portray. Stay away from this one.
1,Terrible quality,This VHS was a bad buy. The quality is so bad that I can not even watch it. I am sure the movie would have been interesting however the tracking was so bad that I had to stop watching in fear that the tape would ruin my VCR.
3,NOT the complete series!,"This edition consists of 3 50 minute tapes. With 3 tapes, you'd think they would feature the complete mini-series. But many character scenes have been cut, especially those by John Huston! Still worth seeing until a better version comes along."
3,"Good record, but the review: a lot of hooey","This is a great little pop record (more than 15 years old now)... but this review? ""Sacred?"" Don't insult the pop artists or the religion with that new age reinterpretation. This is 80s London dance floor boogie, John Travolta dance music with a vaguely Indo-beat. great stuff, but let's keep some perspective!"
2,Eh...what can I say? Not that great.,"Overall, I was interested in the idea of this book, but the way this book was put together is a bit disappointing. It's just one giant list of bad movie lines. True, this is what the title says, but why not arrange it where you get a background on the movie then they give you the stupid lines?You'd have to see every single terrible movie to really appreciate all these movie lines, and who wants to see a ton of terrible movies? So unless you've seen every single movie that they took lines out of, I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,The format ruins the book!,"The authors compiled a huge list of stupid movie lines but ordered it by subject instead of movie! This means you can't flip through the book, find a specific movie, and read the stupid lines from it. This completely ruined the book for me."
3,A few mistakes but overall a fun read,Sure this book has a few mistakes but the author more than makes up for it by his enthusiasm for the subject. I found this to be a very entertaining few hours of reading about a little known piece of the civil war. Don't let the previous reviewers poor comments deter you this is a worthy addition to civil war naval history
2,Disk #1 Manufactor Defects,Season 4 is a terrific season for TNG however the low rating is due to manufactors problems with disk 1. I was unable to play the episodes 'Brothers' and 'Suddenly Human' on my DVD player. Both episodes were extremely jumpy. The picture was highly pixilized and the sound came out distorted. I thought it might be the DVD player so I played the disk on my DVD-ROM to see if the same thing would happen and the DVD would not play at all. I tried cleaning the disk and still had the same problems.
3,A sober accessment - mixed bag,"I disagree with the previous reviews attesting to the greatness of season 4. To the contrary, I find season 4 a mixed bag. About half the episodes are good with convincing story lines. The other half are largely stupid, corny and outlandish stories with poor scripts that should have been rejected for better ones. You almost get the feeling that some of these scripts were written by teenagers. This same scenario plagues the entire NG series. I remember when NG originally aired back in 88-94. I often found myself turning the channel to something else - except when a good episode was on. This could've and should've been better."
1,BORING,"This episode is really lame, it was all over the place, it seemed random and out of place even in a disjointed series. It was neither compelling or interesting."
4,One of the best 2 seasons!,"I haven't actually started watching this season yet- my trek nerd fiance and I are still in season 3. He has said numerous times that seasons 3 and 4 are the best, and so far season 3 is much better than 1 and 2 were, so I suspect this will be accurate... Anyway, if you already have the first 3 seasons, you should buy this one to complete the collection, it would look funny to have seasons 1-3 and 5-7 but not 4, you know? :)"
5,Excellent Season,This is my favorite season. Here the show really took off and had terrific episodes focusing on the characters. Buy it! You won't regret it!
4,Star Trek TNG - Season 4,It arrived in good amount of time and came with bonus material from the manaufacturer. Very satisfied. You will be happy.
5,Two Thumbs UP,"I have been a Star Trek Fan my whole life. Everything from Startrek The Motion Picure to UPN's new Enterprise. I love everything Star Trek. I even own one of Commander Riker's (Jonathan Franks) Original uniforms that was auctioned at a Star Trek Convention. My point is, Star Trek TNG was the best television series ever on television. I now own the first 3 seasons on DVD. If you don't already own those seasons buy them. I have also shopped around for these DVD sets, Amazon has the best prices I have seen, and thier free shipping is fast. As far as season 4 goes, From what I rember of watching it on tv. It was as good if not better than season 3. This is a must buy. I can't wait for it to come out. Also a note to Paramount, if you guys read this note, you should strongly consider doing a Voyager DVD season set too. But when you do Voyager, release them all at the same time, will ya?""Live Long And Prosper"" ~Lt. Spock"
2,More Bad Disc,"I just got this season and was looking forward to watching the episode ""brothers"" for the first time only to discover the first disc is bad and doesnt play. I am begining to wonder if all the products from here are sub-standard quality or what?The Series itself is ok, entertaining but if your a Star Trek fan and like continuity you might want to be careful where you buy it since you can't return it opened and a bad disc is useless. This is the second time I have received a bad disc in a season of a series I ordered here.I ordered Season three of Voyager as well at the same time and it also had a bad disc. I am very disappointed. One bad disc one time is bad enough but two in the same order just enough to screw up both series is crazy. Is there any recourse at all?Very disappointed."
4,A little TOO character driven,"Season 4: I'm not sure what happened with this season, it was good and maybe some of my fellow trekkers will disagree, but it seemed like the writers just wanted this season to be full of one character story lines. ""Family"" is a Picard episode, ""Brothers"" is a Data (Brent Spiner plays three characters for goodness sake), ""Suddenly Human"" Picard, ""Remember Me"" Beverly Crusher, ""Reunion"" Worf, ""Future Imperfect"" and ""First Contact"" Riker, ""Data's Day"" Obvious. It wasn't every episode but a larger chunk than normal. Hence the four-star instead of five."
2,star trek next generation season 4,I got star trek next generation season 4 was missing disc 5 and I was disappointed that this happened with amazon
2,What happened to the packaging?,"I love all of the seasons of the series. I love to collect them, and yes it's been a slow process for me. I was disappointed to receive season 4 in a different box than the rest of the seasons I own. Particularly since the pictures of the box set show the correct packaging I'm used to. Why the change? I'm tempted to return the item and request original packaging, or to at least contact Amazon and ask why it has changed."
1,Pickles and peanut butter?!!!,"Perhaps my tastes are a bit less adventurous than I thought. But whenever I read the recipe for a Pickle and Peanutbutter sandwich, I almost died laughing. (In case you are interested: 2 slices of bread, spread with peanut butter and sandwich 4 pickle slices between them.) Sounds more like a pregnancy craving than something I would serve to my children or myself. Nothing really struck me in this book. Lots of fairly unhealthy fare."
2,Lackluster,"I had high hopes for this CD, which I bought unseen and unheard because samples were impossible to find online. ""Trio Rouge"" got some airplay on world music programs, and I am a new fan of Lucilla Galeazzi, so I decided to give it a try.I was disappointed by the result of this ""experiment"". The performances are bland and uninspiring. By and large, this could be generic pop-jazz and offers very little of the ""Mediterranean atmosphere"" promised by the record label. These three artists may each be masters of their own instruments (tuba, violoncello, and voice), but the sum of the parts is something less than satisfying. Not a disaster, mind you, but a waste of money.Move along, there is nothing to see here."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED BY OTHER REVIEWERS,"VOL. 1 MAY CONTAIN THE SONGS LISTED BY THE OTHER REVIEWERS, HOWEVER, THIS IS VOL. 2 AND IT ONLY CONTAINS UNRELEASED SONGS AND COMMERCIALS."
1,Disappointed in Coltland,"A big disappointment. I own nearly all of R.L. Wilson's books, and bought this out of love for such things. Nowhere NEAR the quality of other books in my collection, it was a big, big disappointment. Not only are the photos not up to par, but the text is horrid. Doc O'Meara apparently writes to make a quick buck -- not for the love of the subject like Wilson."
5,revolutionary book to improve views on life and other people,"This is a very short, yet very comprehensive book on how to improve your view on life, people around you, improve their view of you, the art of persuasion, the art of bringing the best out if yourself and others around you. best short self-improvement book i've ever read."
3,Pro and con,"Pro: It gives helpful advice on how to deal with difficult people from a Christian perspective.Con: A lot of the advice is just a re-inerating of what is said in Dale Carnegie's book, ""How To Win Friends And Influence People."""
2,FIT,These Jeans do not fit like the last pair that I purchased!!! I would not purchase these Jeans again !!!
2,One gem amongst a mediocre bunch of crap,"The only good story in this book is the one by Roberta Gellis - all the other stories are lame, badly written, and condescending."
4,Plasti-Goop Refills for Creepy Crawlers,"The Plasti-Goop refills are a neccessary product to provide lasting supplies for the Creepy Crawlers Workshop by Toymax. The Creepy Crawler product goes back at least 25 years (I believe by Mattel) and had a very large selection of molds for making all kinds of small plastic toys ranging from worms, frogs, lizards, bugs, army men and trolls.Fifteen or twenty years ago this product line disapeared and I was unable to get more Plasti-Goop. Luckily I had saved all of my molds and a couple of years ago I spotted the new Toymax product. I bought a new system and have enjoyed using it with my young sons. Lately I have not been able to find the Plasti-Goop in the stores in my area and was very happy to find it here on your web site.This product is indeed a neccessary product in order enjoy the fun of the Creepy Crawler product line. Without it all you have is a bunch of molds and no way to use them. Please continue to carry this product!"
2,Terrible prints of Mix classics,"SKY HIGH is one of Mix's liveliest films, and JUST TONY is rendered amusingly offbeat by taking the perspective of Tom's horse, but the source material used for this Alpha Video release appears to be third or fourth generation dupes of old Blackhawk prints. The result is western landscapes that blur into a grey sludge, and facial features that can't be seen because they're lost in high-contrast glare. This could have been a terrific release had Alpha bothered to track down decent copies of the Blackhawk releases, but as it is, this DVD cannot be recommended."
1,Great package cover - awful content quality,"If you are looking for a nice clean copy of these two Tom Mix films, pass this one up. The cover is excellent but the picture quality is beyond terrible for both films. You can make out just enough of the story to tell that these were excellent movies, well done considering the primitive early 1920s technology. Mix was fantastic in his stunts! If you have never seen these two movies, the price is low enough that you can afford to take a look but don't expect anything of quality."
4,Old Movies,Hubby loves anything Tom Mix and we actually laughed as we read the subtitles to these silent movies. There were definitely no special affects!
2,Seems too much like late Stevens,"Graham seems too involved with the imagery and particularly the style of the late poetry of Wallace Stevens. E.g., ""An Ordinary Evening at New Haven."""
4,Very interesting,"In the south of France there is an area containing many churches, shrines and so on. They all fall into massive, well laid-out pentagrams and grids. This book is kind of a followup to ""Holy Blood Holy Grail"" which is an excellent read. For those of you into VERY weird coincidences (or secret plots) will enjoy this. There is definately something going on....."
4,Great Crate- but be careful with teething puppies,"the crate is overall nice, light, convenient to setup and fold for transport. The pockets are great and handy to keep clutter out of sight. the only criticism would be the mesh on the sides isn't bulletproof strong, seems to be a tough coated plastic mesh but my bulldog who is teething was able to chew a small hole through it which if she continues, would render the crate unusable, if your dog is not a chewer it's a great product, if he/she is, be wary of this or just spray bitter apple on it. After i did she has stopped."
2,almost worthless,"This crate is way too expensive for what you get out of it. Yes, I understand this crate is not for everyday use, but even with limited use I found it very flimsy. My dog escaped from it within 30 minutes of being placed inside. So then I duct taped the zipper -still escaped. So then I reinforced the zipper with wire ties. Once again - escaped faster than Houdini! In the end, I had to reinforce all the sides using whatever I could find around the house (grids from organizational cubes wire tied to the outside for safety finally stopped her from chewing through the nylon) - now she at least stays in it while I mop - if I mop quick.Overall, use your money for a much sturdier crate EVEN if you want something quick and temporary. This is really not worth it.2 stars for being cute and pink though."
4,Roomy enough for two dogs!,The crate has more than enough room for my two 20+ pounds dogs. It has ample openings for air circulation and is very transportable. It only takes a couple minutes to put up or take down. The dogs have even scratched at the nylon netting and it is just fine. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,Not worth it,"I bought this crate for a road trip this summer. My dog is a Cav Spaniel (18 pounds) so this crate could be a bit large for her, but I wanted her to have extra room since she was in a new environment. The first time we left her in the hotel room she broke the side zipper; the second time she broke the front zipper. Finally, she tore through the mesh and now it is unusable. The crate is great for traveling, but if you have a bigger dog than my Cav, I would suggest buying something else."
1,Easily destroyed,"We bought this crate as new puppy parents of a labrador retriever. We liked the look of it and it seemed more home-like than the metal crates we had seen. Unfortunately we were very wrong! Originally it was way too big and is virtually impossible to section off as our puppy was being trained, therfore, we had a lot of accidents which were more difficult to clean with this crate vs. a metal crate. The final demise came when my dog chewed a hole in the bottom of the crate and finally pawed at the side so that her toe nail punchered the netting and ripped a hole which she was able to escape from. Thankfully she did not hurt or strangle herself, but the possibility is there. My suggestion...go with a simple metal crate w/ a divider and bottom pan - they are easy to clean and can grow with your dog....not to mention less expensive."
3,Pet Gear Home'N Go Soft-Sided Pet Crate,"I ordered this product because it was advertised as light-weight and easy to assemble. The photo looked as if the dog inside would have good visibility to the outside.The crate is not easy to assemble and requires strength. While not terribly heavy (22 lbs), it is heavy given the bulkiness of the crate. The weight makes assembly harder. The netting is so dark in color that there is not good visibility for the animal inside; instead it is kind of claustrophobic. I returned the crate."
4,Good crate for well-mannered dogs,"I have two fairly large dogs: 70 and 80 pounds. I also have a minivan in which I transport them. I currently have two of the Large size (Green) Home'N Go crates permanently set up in my van in place of the second row seats. I use the side van doors and leave the crate side access doors open full time. Both of my dogs are crate trained and do not chew or scratch at the crates. In the house, I use wire crates. I would recommend these crates for use in a vehicle as they do not scratch the interior. I am changing to the Medium size to allow the front seat passengers more leg room. I have found that the dogs do not really need the Large size, even when traveling for hours.One weakness of the soft crates is that there is no place to hang water buckets or food bowls. This would be a nice addition."
3,A Book for Specialists,"I was hoping for a book about Confederate mail service in the Trans-Mississippi area, which is a pretty tight specialty area in itself, but this book goes a notch further--it's about the _stamps_ used in the Tran-Miss. 1862-65.The book is 1984 copyright, a small press publication, so looks dated in font and layout, but there's nothing wrong with the info--if this is what you're looking for. Lots of b&w images of Civil War Confederate letters and postage. Short, but interesting, intro info. Total length about 70 pages. The copy I got was rather dirty and faded, so I don't imagine there's been a huge demand for copies!"
1,don't stand behind products,"Bought one of their $1100 grills 4 years ago. The parts inside disintegrated!! They replace all but one crucial part that isn't being made any longer, the part that holds up the burners!!! Buy a weber"
4,Great price; Happy with results,"The prices of polariing filters span a very, VERY large range. I was a bit sceptical about the cheaper ones, but didn't want to spend very much. Decided to try this inexpensive one. It words fine and the pictures with it appear to be just fine. The filter works well; but the quality of construction is consistent with the lower price. The rotating portion is pretty loose and has a very slight tendancy to wobble in its non-rotating portion. The filter just doesn't feel very solid. But overall, I'm happy with the purchase; Amazon.com has it a really good price. If you're in the market for an inexpensive polarizing filter, this is a good choice...just don't expect it to be the same feel as the more expensive ones."
4,Setting up a LAN web server,"A very informative book. However, the title should read ""Setting up a LAN web server"". This book explains how to set up your company directly to the web THROUGH an ISP. Not how to set up a web server to be an ISP, or to provide ISP service for your company directly."
1,To Old To Be Useful!,"This would be a really nice book if it was still 1960, however it's 2001 and things have changed ALLOT! It's not the books fault but save your money and find something newer. If you're still running old hardware and software this book may be perfect for you. END"

2,...Could've Been A Classic,"""Amish kids got the best parties. They got the wild parties."" How can you go wrong with a documentary about Amish teenagers smoking, drinking, and dealing drugs, bowling, roller skating, and taking the none-too-occasional bong rip? Unfortunately, pretty wrong. An awesome subject matter is completely underwhelmed in this uninspired, rhythmically challenged, visually amateurish and all around clunky film. See it? Sure. Buy it? No way. You'll never watch it again."
3,Boys will be boys,"Being an English teacher in France and being interested in the Amish community, this documentary comes in very handy to show the dilema Amish teenagers face once they turn 16: to belong or not to belong to the community. This documentary surely throws some light on this radical decision-making time by focusing on different profiles, however I find that some scenes are rather long and repetitive. Besides, given the poor quality of the sound at times and the strong American accent, I think that English subtitles might help my French pupils..."
2,blegh!,"this book will leave you feeling very disatisfied. first of all, when the book begins you are made to think that our heroine is a young girl named Alida, and this romance will center around her. nope. although the beginning is well written and promising, we find that the romance will generally only take place between a woman met by this girl on a stagecoach and the father of our 'intended' hero, Julian..i don't want to give the story away, but I didn't find this book satisfying at ALL in the romance department...the love between this woman and the earl seemed sooo rushed, and we don't really see a lot of Alida anymore. So it's confusing, and not very exciting, and not very romantic."
2,"Nice try, no cigar","I picked this up at a remainder/damaged house for less than a tenth of the retail price, and was glad I didn't pay more. I primarily collect Dylan boots -- and some Elvis as well -- and at first I was pleased with the many pages of Dylan listings. But when I began to go over them in detail, I was quickly disappointed. Tracks were listed for most items, but many were not, and ""Quality"" reports were very spotty, with most items apparently not seen or heard by the participants. There were some glaring Beatles omissions (such as the massive ""Thirty Days""), and Elvis, who is one of the most highly bootlegged rock artists ever, had less than a single page of listings. Boot collectors are advised to eschew this book and seek out works on individual artists and the many bootleg guides to such artists online."
3,"Too much historical data, not enough romance","I generally like Evelyn Richardson's books. They tend to be lengthier and more ""wordy"" than the average regency(Signet uses small print so that the books stay about the same size). The musical aspect of this book is what attracted me. It was interesting to read about the heroine's musical aspirations, and her voice lessons. However, there was so much historical trivia thrown in, the romance suffered. There was a lot about the French emigres in Britain. I don't mind history, I just felt overwhelmed by it and had a hard time staying interested in the story. I also didn't really care for hearing all about the hero's exploits with his lovers. It turned me off from the romance between him and the heroine. I probably will keep this book because of the musical theme, but doubt I will re-read it much, if at all."
2,Sent me to sleep...,"The premise of this book could have been interesting - younger son of duke falls in love with daughter of French emigres, with all the difficulties that create given the mutually exclusive cultures both come from. But instead it was simply tedious. Add to that the heroine's driving ambition to become a world-famous opera singer, which conveniently vanished once she decided that she was in love with the hero, and the characterisation wasn't very good either.Richardson's knowledge of French revolutionary history is good, but she really needed to brush up on her names and titles. Apart from spelling the Duc de Berry as the Duc de Berri throughout (definitely not a French spelling!), she seems to think that Comte is the highest French title - above that of Duc.This book went straight to the recycle pile!"
5,Where did thid one come from,It's that time again the Immaculate conception of the jedi mind. I don't know where these guys get the lyrics and don't really care as long as they keep this up I was so impressed with their first two cd's it was unbelievable the third was ok and I hope the 4 will be amazing because i've been looking forward to it for a long while know. I hope they keep the real jedi mind lyrics but add a new twist. I don't know about you but i'll be the first one at HMV buying this cd that a garuntee
4,Great guided reading book!,"I am a third grade teacher and this past year one of my guided reading groups read ""A Llama in the Family"" by Johanna Hurwitz. We had so much fun reading about Adam and his adventures with Ethan Allen. My students were enthralled with the idea of a llama as a family pet. Johanna Hurwitz was skillful weaving so many fun and meaningful experiences into her story. As a post reading assignment my students had to make pamphlets to advertise a llama trek. What made it special to me is that this summer my husband and I found a bed and breakfast, The Applewood Inn in Virginia, that actually offered llama treks. Needless to say, that was the hook that got us to stay there. We didn't eat blueberry soup on our trek, but we learned so much more about llamas. Pick up a copy of the book, it is so much fun to read and there is much to learn about llamas."
4,It's a spectacular book!,Hi I'm a third grader from the U.S and I give a Llama in The Family four stars for its good ideas and suspense. I was on my toes through the whole book. I would recommend this book to a 7 or 8 year old kid because it is challenging but it is not long enough. As you probably know by the title the story is about a llama that somehow joins a family. You will find that the llama makes the family crazy with sprises and excitement.
3,This book is ok.,I am a third grader in the United States. I give the Llama in the Family a three star rating. I think it could have a little more information about the book. But I still enjoyed the book. I thought it would be a little better then it was. I liked the part when Adam went to get another Llama. I liked that part the best out of all of the chapters of the book. I think it could have a little bit more plot in the book. But I still enjoyed the book. I think this book is one of the best books I have ever read.
1,How does this guy sell these cd's?,"Someone please help me understand how this guy was able to get this depressing dribble released to the general population? This could be the WORST music I have ever heard in my entire life. I have a fairly extensive CD collection that ranks in the thousands with exposure to lots of different musical styles. Please take a close listen to the samples before buying this garbage. Coldplay and Radiohead should NOT be compared to this trash. Additionally, if you are tired of being a generally happy person and want to mess that up play this album."
5,11/16 t-slot tee nuts,I am using on my drill press table. they are made very strong and will work great to mount vises and other attachments on my bench top drill press.
1,CAUTION!,"This is an old version of the Generac Pro Series 3500psi 4gpm unit. It does NOT come with the good CAT pump like the newer model does.Stay away from this, no savings in the old type pump."
5,very good unit,I've owned this washer unit for about 1.5 years. Never had a problem with it. It always starts on the 1st or the 2nd pull. Very easy to find parts (air filter) for it.
4,A must have for any Linux sysadmin,"I am giving it 4 instead of 5 only for being a little rpm-ized, (as I am a fan of Debian).Even if you know almost everything, this book can help as a sumarized how-to of many things you'll need to setup at a given time."
4,"A fun, engaging book","I picked up this book after reading some of the reviews on-line, loved it so much that I bought it for a friend too. As a beginning guitarist this book has been the most helpful in that it is engaging and humurous. The level is good for a person just picking up the guitar, though as stated in a few other reviews it won't cover everything that you might want to know (I have yet to find a book that does!) You'll learn some chord structures, basic strumming, drilling techniques, as well as a small repertoire of songs. The accompanying tape is great too!Ironically enough, a few months after buying this book I began taking some group guitar classes at a local guitar shop from a woman named Carol. A few classes in and I said, ""Wow, Carol sounds a lot like the woman on my book tape. Hey, wait a minute, Carol. . .""If you're in the Palo Alto, CA area, then come take her classes too, she's a wonderful teacher and a VERY talented musician!"
2,For true beginners only,"This book covers only the very basics, some open chords and strumming patterns. You'd be disappointed, like I was, if you're looking for a primer on playing real country & blues songs. For the same amount of money, I'd get Arnie Berle's Beginning Fingerstyle Blues Guitar, which is much more substantive and more helpful if you ever want to get beyond the beginner's stage."
4,Musically hopeless in North Carolina!,I recently purchased this book and tapes. I found it was a wonderful way to quickly learn a few tunes. The instruction was simple and easy to understand and the music was great! Just wish Carol would put out a video to go along with the book. That would even be better!
1,disappointed,"I recently ordered this book specifically for the audio tapes that were showen to come with the book. I had purchased this book before and lost one of the tapes. The book is a good one and in all fairness to the seller it came in good shape, but now I have two of the same books and still short one audio tape:("
1,I did not receive full order (No Tapes),I also owned the book but lacked both of the tapes. I ordered and received no tapes with the book.Jim
5,Juarez,"Terry Allen is one of the most interesting, wry, gifted songwriters on the contemporary music scene. Anyone who claims to love music but hasn't listened to Terry Allen's views on Texas, love and getting wise should go sit in the peanut gallery. Not only does he write lyrics that make you think, his music and musicianship are top of the line. Be warned, tho', if you listen to Juarez it will make you want to run out and buy the whole collection of his works. Try Lubbock, too."
1,Junk,"The Xbox game I tried to ""repair"" with this kit went from damaged to completely unreadable.I want my money back. Avoid at all costs."
1,Weak effort,"I went and bought this disc repair kit a couple days ago. I'm here to tell you right now that this thing doesn't work. It was so cute how in the directions it says to ""gather all your damaged [discs] and prepare to start enjoying them all over again."" Or not. I grabbed a couple of my discs that needed some help and this device provided no relief, only more headaches. Save yourself the annoyance and don't buy this product. I'm going out tomorrow to try to find something else."
3,2MB Cache...Do Not Buy This!,"Why pay for this, when you can probably get the 8MB cache version for nearly the same price?"
1,Okay Quality - Horrible Fit,"Since I am petite, I ordered this in extra small however the top could not even go through my head! Even my 10 year old niece had a time getting it over her head - who are they making these things for? If that was not frustrating enough, it had a funky smell. I would not purchase this - over priced poor quality item."
1,Disappointed,GE Push On/Off Round Mini Touch Light - Battery Operated #55219Lights only worked for about two days before having to change the batteries. Really disappointed in this product. Try LED lights instead.
1,Too small and no power,"I was really disappointed with the size of these as it is not listed on here - they are tiny!! Also, for being so small you would think batteries would last forever, no I've had them less than a week and they're already dead"
1,Battery Life,I was very disappointed with the life of the battery life. I had to change the batteries too many times for what this light was used for.
3,Xmas gift,Gave this to a 24 year old as a present at Xmas. Thought it would be very diffult but he opened it in 10 minutes. Still a lot of fun watching.
2,Horrible quality,"We purchased three of these for Christmas gift card giving and when the box arrived the first one we took out had a plastic piece snapped off that would hold the tray in so it just slid around without having to solve the puzzle.The second one looked good initially, however when we loaded the box and after the recipient opened it up the tray slid right out without having to solve the puzzle. It looked like a metal piece inside that is part of the spring mechanism was out of place so the tray never locked in.The third puzzle actually worked so a 33% success rate definitely rates the 2 of 5 star review here."
1,Terrible quality,This product was mad of cheap plastic and was not big enough to hold paper money. They both went in the garbage!
1,Grrrr!,"First of all, there are no instructions on how to get your money IN. There is a sample bill inside and I need to get that out before I can put my money IN. Secondly, the instructions on the back are covered up by the sellers bar-code stickers and won't come off. Thank you Mr. Seller. So do I really have to try to solve this thing before I even put the my money in? Seriously I have a gazillion presents to wrap and I don't have time to try to solve this stupid thing."
3,Great for geocaching!,These containers are good for putting logbooks into for geocaching. Makes the finder work for his log! Don't want to make it too easy for someone once they get to the cache site.
1,Unsatisfactory,"This particular money puzzle feels and looks cheap, and it doesn't work correctly. If you're paying more than $2.99 for this product, you're being scammed. Don't buy it."
4,Perfect for giving money as a gift,"The BILZ BOX money maze toy is the size of a VHS cassette tape. A perfect way of giving teenagers money for gifts instead of an envelope with a silly bow on it. kids appreciate the money you give them if there's a gimick to getting to the cash.Although a good gift for a teenager, it's not for those who are impatient, get frustrated easily, have problems solving maze-type puzzles, or a less-than-average IQ. I wouldn't recommend it for the very young. It comes with a cheater's card the giver should keep in case of over-frustration in solving. It also fits well with a VHS tape collection (same size) storing and future playing.My Mother gave three of these BILZ BOX money-maze toys with money inside, to 3 of grandchildren one Christmas. It was a Christmas Morning hit! After the kids got their money out, dollar bills were put in for others to try. People played with them all day long."
1,"False advertising, total crap","Very very disappointed! The picture clearly leads you to believe an open $20 bill would fit. NO WAY! This is far smaller than that. The dimensions are 5-1/2 X 3-1/4 and the slot for the bill is 2-1/4 inches wide. They have a miniature 4X2 bill inside the box when you get it. Don't buy it -- thinking we would use it for gift cards or something, we tried it. One broke almost immediately.WASTE OF MONEY!"
3,Average Microwave Popcorn,"Sometimes microwave popcorn can be a little tricky because if you don't leave it in long enough you get a lot of unpopped corn, leave it in too long it gets scorched. I've discovered it does matter what brand of popcorn you use because some simply perform better than others.Act II is about average as a microwave popcorn. The key downfall of Act II is if you get it popped about right, the popcorn is kind of dry and not that fluffy. It also tends to leave more unpopped corn in my experience than other brands.For these reasons, I tend to prefer other brands of microwave popcorn."
2,Not at all convinced,"I always find it difficult when reading tales written by Americans about WW11 and the British experience of it. The is even more so the case when the American in question is not in any way part of the generation that experienced that war. There are howling errors especially regarding various types of military hardware especially aircraft that show a serious failure of research. This is combined with yet another boring attempt to talk up the warrior status of the US Marines, as if we needed to be told another time about how truly amazing they are. The story has pace to be sure and some interesting twists but on the whole it is let down by inconsistencies the need of the author to bring in all things American while talking of a theatre of war where the US was not even involved for the first three years."
3,A Book That You Can Put Down And Come Back To,"I'm a nut for books about time-travel. My favorites are written by Jack Finney. Joshua Dann does write well but somehow he loses the excitement and nostalgia that are a part of most time-travel adventures. This is a black-and-white book in an era of technicolor books; no ""oomph."" Maybe it's the characters; perhaps it is the plot. All I know is that its presentation does not ""grab"" the reader and does not compell one to keep reading. Even trying to recall it is an effort although Jack Finney's time travel novels are crystal-clear in my mind. Dann somehow doesn't do it."
2,PAST IMPERFECT,"John Surrey is a character who doesn't like self-importance and ignorance in others, yet carries it around in himself. Whether he realizes it or not, he's rather sexist and homophobic (as are many of the characters in Dann's Time Share series). Unlike the two previous novels in the series, nothing in A TIME FOR WAR makes for such good reading that you can overlook the flaws. Mr. Dann is a good storyteller, but he mistakes old-fashioned charm for old-fashioned ignorance and this title proves that the third time is not the ""charm."""
4,Buy it for Freddy Kempf,"In my humble opinion, Freddy Kempf is one of the greatest pianists of this era (though he didn't win the first prize in Moscow, but well... who cares! I don't even know who won the first prize when Kempf got the third). His playing of the 24 Etudes is so passionate yet very refined. Probably a tad stronger and more forceful than the Chopin playing of Pires or Zimerman but it is defenitely first rate. The other two pianists featured here, Angela Hewitt and Alfredo Perle did a fine job, though not as striking as Kempf's playing. Five starts for a beautiful production (by BBC), five stars (at least!) for Kempf, three stars for the rest of the DVD."
3,clean product but doesn't,"I have sensitive skin and avoid harsh cleansers. So, when I found this product, I was excited. I love the scent and how light and gentle this creamy cleanser feels but it doesn't seem to clean the make-up off my face well. I have to wash at least couple of times to get totally clean."
2,Creamy Formula but Allergen Inducing - SOY,"This is a great creamy lotion cleanser for all skin. Unfortunately for me, after using this for a few weeks I noticed little red bumps everywhere on my face. When I read the ingredients and saw that Soybean Oil was listed as a top ingredient it became clear. I am highly allergic to soy and soy products (even so-called sensitive Aveeno's soy-based line is a no-go for me...I can ONLY use their oat-based line of products). So, this product is a great natural alternative to cream cleansers, IF you aren't allergic to soy. Otherwise, stay away! I really like Juice Beauty Cleansing Gel and Cerave cleansers (both the foaming and cream cleanser are wonderful!) Otherwise, Earth Science is a great company!"
4,Fit,This is a nice shirt as far as material and design go but my only complaint about it is the cut. I am 6'1 180 pounds. I got a large and it is huge on me. It's cut more like a basketball shirt than a running shirt. Most running shirts are a little more fitted and tapered. I would recommend buying at least a size smaller than you normally wear.
5,works well,"The product has lasted well, was easy to install and really helps tidy up our little sports nook. I can put at least seven racquets on it (a mixture of tennis and racquetball) and it may fit eight."
3,Can You See What I See? Dream Machine,"Although we love the I Spy books, this one seems to have darker background pictures. The book doesn't seem interesting for the ages 2-6. The kids have trouble finding things in the dark backgrounds and loose interet in the book fast."
2,"Take a D-8 Caterpillar bulldozer and marry it to a jabbering librarian, gestate an offspring.",Oh this man is tiresome tiresome tiresome. He does no prove Darwin wrong with his scientific insights but he does provide a lot of eyestrain and befuddlement.
3,Not Very Helpful for the Severly Depressed or Isolated.,"It's obvious from the other reviews that this book has been very helpful to many people suffering from depression. However, it ended up making me feel even more depressed than I was before. It gives suggestions such as surrounding yourself with things to remind you of why life is worth living, but the severely depressed may be so isolated that they really have nothing to live for. It also suggests a heavy reliance on support from friends and family, and, again, a severely depressed person may no longer have friends or close family members to rely upon. I can imagine that people suffering from mild to moderate depression would be helped a great deal by this book, but for those who are so depressed that they've withdrawn from the world and really have nothing left to live for, this book will only make them feel more depressed, hopeless, and isolated from the world."
3,Practical-with a grain of salt,"As a workbook, this is very good, and works very well. The author seems to have a chip on her shoulder about the medical community, which is her right; however, I take her opinions with a grain of salt."
1,This book is not for everyone,"I started reading this book when I was newly diagnosed, and it was not helpful. It seems to be aimed at a grade school mentality, and the ""exercises"" are condescending and patronizing. If you feel that you need this type of care, this should be a good resource for you. But for people who desire a little more intellectual stimulation and who prefer to be treated as adults, I do not recommend this book. Unfortunately, there is not much alternative out there at present; the profession seems to prefer to treat down to the lowest common denominator. Sadly, no change seems to be in sight."
4,What works and what doesn't.,"Sure, settings like birthday parties and family gatherings are probably good places to be if one is occasionally depressed. But for those whose depression has organic bases, usually not. In large part, the families of those who are seriously depressed do not comprehend the illness. Depression crosses the borders of socio-economic status, intelligence, and age, and its treatment is much more complex than trying to fix the symptoms.Books that do not acknowledge these basic aspects of depression fail to further the cause of helping the depressed, and possibly keep popular misunderstandings as the status quo."
1,Suggestions for a rewrite,"This is an addendum to my review of two years ago.First off, I mentioned that the book is written on a grade-school level. Why not produce another edition, with the title ""The Depression Workbook for Smart People"" or ""The Depression Workbook for the College-Educated""? This may help some of us to feel less put off and alienated.Additionally, the book is also written from a highly feminine point of view. The profession expresses concern that more men are not coming forward and seeking help for depression, but I believe many men are not comfortable with many of the suggestions put forward in this book (and many others). Men are not inclined to take up painting, or knitting, or flower arranging. We like skeet shooting, NASCAR, and cage fighting. In other words, expecting men to become more like women in order to get well is unreaslistic. Another suggested edition: ""The Depression Workbook for Men."""
1,it was a dirty library book,"The book was dirty with grayish pages in pretgy bad condition, written and torn. I will defintely return this ridiculous library book"
5,The most encouraging and helpful book I've read!,This is the first book that has actually helped me and my family deal with my illness. The techniques used are very encouraging; you WANT to refer to this handbook on a regular basis and do the exercises. The clinical information was also helpful. Read this and begin to get better!
5,Great book,It is a wonderful book to help those individuals who have depression understand how to control it and to learn more about their disability. Manic depression is classified as bi-polar so those who have bi-polar may want to check this book out as well.
2,Too complicated,I thought this would be a great way to work out some of the issues I've been struggling with. It was suggested by my therapist. I found it way to complicated and time consumptive... so I gave it away.
4,Use in your fight against depression.,Help for those with this diagnosis. I found this useful for self-study. It will engage you to challenge your thinking and help you identify those automatic thoughts that have destructive with ways to over come. Certainly worth your money and time.
3,Not as shown,"I loved Pit as a kid...(with the orange bell!) so I was delighted to find this for my family. However, this one doesn't come with a bell! And the categories are different than what is shown. I sent it back & got the deluxe version with the bell!"
4,Good padding for throwing in bag for commute,I use this pouch to cushion Nexus from other stuff in bag when taking to work. I didn't want anything bulky or hard so this fits what I was looking for. Will probably cut off string and just use rubber band though. The disks the string wraps around are so tight against material that the string doesn't wrap very well.
1,the picture depicting this product is wrong.,"The 8008 stablizer kit mounts end to end accross the front , not one behind the other as depicted in the photo. Also this will only work on a truck with a fabtech 5-1/2"" lift kit it will not work on a stock or 3 inch lifted truck."
4,very nice....but carefull with size...,The quality of the leather is very good... the pants are nicely tight and keep wind out...careful with the size : I had to get 2 sizes above my normal pants size... I think at least one size above is a good rule of thumb.
4,Good design/value -- abit tight and thin,"I like the velcro side latches and full length zippers. However, this leather appears thinner than most and the lower legs are tighter. That said, it's still a very good value and I would recommend it."
2,"Super Tight, did not fit well.","The quality of these looked nice, but I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I am normally and these still did not fit. They were skin pants made to wear without clothes underneath it seemed. I have large quads and hamstrings and maybe its just the style of these pants compared to my body structure.These didn't work at all for me and I returned them. Went with Chaps and I am much happier."
5,"No Uncle Sam, The Forgotten of Bataan","The book No Uncle Sam: The Forgotten of Bataan needed to be written to tell the story of those who were forgotten on Bataan, and in Japan as POWS. The personal experiences of Tony, and those who experienced each moment of each day hungry and deprived of even the basic human necessities and rights makes a strong statement of the human desire to survive against all odds. Even more amazing to me is ability to come home after such an experience and continue with life, raise a family, and watch enemies become allies. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in what humans are capable of both for good and bad."
2,Not worth the time to look at it online,"We bought this for a Christmas gift for our son. What a colossal waste of money. He was so dissappointed that it was so hard to use (even with adult help). My husband had to re-solder wire connections before we could even use it once. We would have been better off to buy a strong magnifying glass and the prepared slides and looking at the slides that way. Actually finding and focusing on a slide image was almost impossible due to the cheapness of this product. It was his ""big"" present and turned out to be a dud. We'd return it, but that would blow Santa's cover!"
2,Difficult to Use,"This microscope is very difficult to focus; my daughter (8 years old) is not able to use it by herself. In addition, the view isn't very clear. I wonder if it's possible to get a good result with any inexpensive microscope. The up side of this product is that it comes with lots of fun accessories, including several pre-made slides that are interesting to view."
5,Excellence,"The microscope was everything I had hoped for except a faulty light. After contacting the vendor and explaining the problem, they sent a brand new microscope set. This is exceptional service and greatly appreciated."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was very disappointed to open this book and find very bad quality illustrations. For $24 I would expect better than this. The illustrations, which are mostly stills from the movie, are about the same quality as newspaper photos from 40 years ago---very low contrast, mostly gray tones. This ruins what should have been (and sounded like) a good book. I take issue with the previous reviewer who said it has ""improved scans"". If this is the improvement, I'd hate to see what they looked like before. Any book about movies that features Metropolis will have far better quality stills from the movie than this book.Metropolis is one of my favorite films, and its influence can still be discerned today. Moreover, it is a political metaphor for class divisions that grow ever deeper in America. As long as there is a ruling class and an underclass this movie will stay relevant. Your money would be better spent on the excellent DVD of the fully restored film than for this disappointing book."
2,Not worth the price.,"Just received this book, and was soon not particularly satisfied. There are a number of photos that are included showing sets, actors, etc. Most are of poor quality - faded, or not sharply focused. Not sure if it is the printing process they used for the book, or the original source photo material that was used. The introduction by F.J. Ackerman is 2 pages and is basically fluff. This is completely over-priced for what you get. If the paper was high quality instead of thin ordinary printer paper that you use at the office, and the photos were reproduced well - even then, maybe it MIGHT be worth it. Just buy a far cheaper version that doesn't say ""75th Anniversary Edition"" on it, and save yourself $10 or more. This is frankly a rip-off."
4,Improved Scans and printing,This 75th Anniversary edition of Metropolis had been completely re-scanned and the book reprinted on improved presses (as of 10/2002) so that the interior illustrations and quality are much improved. A very nice present for the holidays and a fitting companion to the recently released digital version of the original film.
2,An opportunity wasted,"While it is good to have the novel METROPOLIS available once again, it is a pity the presentation couldn't have been better and more professional. The stills from the film are badly reproduced and look like they went through a poor fax. The posters are in poor black & white instead of color.In addition, since METROPOLIS is a short novel, it would have been quite easy to add a couple of chapters. One excellent one would have been a reprint of the ""Famous Monsters"" articles of several decades ago that dealth with the film's special effects. Another article of interest would've been a discussion of the restortation efforts on this film, especially with another restoration to come out this year and, I believe, to be released by Kino Video on DVD next year.But, no, this was an excellent opportunity wasted by a shoddy presentation."
1,DON'T BUY THIS--IT DOESN'T WORK,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying a replacement for my RF modulator that worked for about 2 months (of perhaps 2 hours total usage, by the way.) The first unit would work only very intermittently, then never receive power--it had clearly shorted out. Stupidly, I bought another one thinking the problem with the first one must have been a fluke. Well, the second one had a single flicker of power come through a couple of times and now nothing at all. There are several other reviewers who had the same problem so it's no fluke. It's shoddy manufacturing--and possibly dangerous if the electrical supply is shorting out? Buy something else. I expected more from Philips."
4,Works like it should,"Bought this to plug in a new DVD player with only RCA outputs into an age-old TV with only a coax input. Works perfectly. The automatic detection of my DVD player being on takes a second, but that's a very small thing, since by the time you start to wonder whether you've done something wrong the unit kicks over to DVD like it should. All in all a good buy, especially for the price."
1,"Not that great, not sure if it is authentic","The product says philips rf modulator, but no where on the product or in the manual is there philips mentioned. The manual is just a one pager of instructions, highly unlikely philips would do that. no troubleshooting etc.the performance is very bad, tried it with numerous cables, TVs and inputs. In some cases the sound quality was bad (large hissing noise overshadowing the actual volume) and in some cases the picture became black n white with color trails all over the place. All-in-all, not a very good experience, and i guess a complete waste of money, for me atleast"
1,"Worked OK for 3 weeks, then died","Seemed to work almost as well as my VCR for conversion, and took almost no power, but... it's not much good if it just dies."
5,Just what I needed,"When it came down to it, price was the motivating factor in this purchase. I use the modulator on an old TV in my home office, where I don't really need to watch DVDs, so I was not willing to spend a lot of money on this device. I just wanted the cheapest thing that works. This model fit the bill perfectly. For way less than the prices at local stores, I was able to get this modulator shipped to me quickly. It was easy to hook up, and works perfectly."
3,A little disappointed but it's probably not related to the modulator,I bought the modulator to connect a small TV in the bedroom with a new Zenith HD Up-conversion DVD player. I was a little disappointed in the picture quality but that may not be related to the modulator. The fact that the TV needed a modulator tells you the quality of the TV and the DVD player is new so there could be many reasons my picture is not what I was hoping for. I found it interesting that I got a better picture when I used the standard composite connection instead of the new S-video cable I bought. Since this is just for the bedroom and will not be used that often I'm not going to bother trying to find out where the real problem is. Reading the other reviews it would seem the modulator is just fine and my problem is with one of the other items connected.
1,Terrible picture quality,"I bought this because my TV was out of RCA inputs, so I wanted to use the one on this to then go into the antenna input. Terrible idea! The picture quality is abysmal; the picture ends up looking the way TV stations used to when they received weak antenna reception. Verified that it wasn't a problem with the device I was connecting or the cables I was using by connecting those to other setups without problem. Only looks bad when running through this. What a waste of money."
3,It works! Four stars.,"As a normally tech-savvy person, I made the unusual move of ordering this RF modulator totally blindly, knowing only that I needed an RF modulator, but not knowing exactly what an RF modulator is, and finding very little helpful information on the internet about whether all RF modulators work with all electronics. Fortunately, it worked with my DVD and VCR, and I didn't need to think about it again. If it worked with my very new DVD and very old VCR, then presumably it will work with yours too.You may need a coax cable to attach the RF modulator to your TV."
2,Stopped working,"It slowly died, It started with faint nearly non visible lines on the screen to it completely dieing. The plug would not power back up. Find another product with better quality."
3,"Low price, but . . .","I do appreciate this box's functionality - I've got an old TV without composite video input (the red/yellow/white hookups); only a single coaxial input. This box let me hook up DVD player/XBox/whatever to the TV, and it worked flawlessly, but only for about three months. Now the connections within the unit itself are loose, and it's essentially useless. My feeling is that the reason this unit is so inexpensive is because it's shoddily manufactured. I'd shell out a little more for the Recoton version or maybe Radioshack's version. Just know that this will probably die before a year is up."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this RF modulator and its power supply has burned out after only 3 weeks of use! i don't use my TV frequently, maybe 1-2 times a week for 1-2 hours, so you would think it would have lasted a LITTLE longer than that! I would not recommend this product."
5,Works Great,"I was given a DVD player that was not compatible with my TV. Having done a bit of research on RF Modulators, I discovered that the average price was around 35.00. I choose the Philips because it was 8.95 and new. It was also the same brand as my TV. I plugged it in without directions and it works great! I have not had a problem with it at all. I would highly recommend this product, but am only using it for a DVD player so I don't know how it works with other devices."
2,Horrible time getting laptop to recognize TV,"This device works great if you are going from RCA jacks to Coax and I'm sure with most S-Video devices. There are two problems I had with it that forced me to return this product and get a different brand. The componant video in will not work if an S-video cable is plugged in, even if it isn't hooked to anything. This is only a problem if you are using multiple video sources.Second, Most laptop computers (I tried a compaq with high end ATI, a dell with intel graphics chip and an HP with Nvidia) simply will not detect the TV through this box. I returned it and got another and they still did not work. All three of these laptops worked instantly with the same setup and a different brand box."
1,Horrible product!,"This product stopped working about 10 minutes after it was first used. I returned the item for a full refund (thank you, Amazon) and ordered a different model."
3,"the product will, ostensibly work, if it is necessary as evisioned,...but..","I was pleased when I received the package, and found it to well-packed. My chagrin was only to find that the item was totally unnecessary, in-inline, as I was envisioned. Good/great product (Company kudo), but superfluous for my purposes (My error). Oh well.. But the price saving was a boon.."
