3,An OK read,"I was a little hesitant to read this book because it was written in the first person. That aspect is quickly forgotten though as you get into the story. The book has many laugh out loud moments. However, I was a little disappointed in the overall ""romance"" aspect of the book. There is very little interaction between Sarah, the heroine, and the master vampire, Thierry. There was a lot more sexual tension and interaction between Sarah and Quinn that I feel they should have ended up together in the end. Overall it wasn't bad, just not as good as I expected."
2,Bitten and Boring,"Sometimes I truly believe that there can be too much of a good thing. Vampire romance novels are one of them. We had Anne Rice the Queen of angst, homoerotic love, and bloodsucking history , and we have MaryJanice whos ""undead"" series is unique funny and very sexually explicit, We have many others on the sidelines that dabble in vampire stories like Kenyon, and Hamilton (whos anita blake series is seriously overrated), Feehan, Ashley, and so many others. This book ""bitten and smitten"" had a promising hook, but again it read to me like a used buffy script, or a rip off of Maryjanice, there wasnt anything new and exciting or even romantic about it at all. Thierry de Bennicoeur? did she go to a ""cheesy vampire hero name generator"" and pluck that one out? There was a skeleton, the barest of skin, sort of story trying to have its way onto literary infamy, but she just couldnt pull it off in the end."
2,"This was edited, right?","I was looking very forward to reading this and snagged it right away. I didn't have alot of fun reading it, there were too many inconsistencies, too much copy-catting of other successful books in this vein. I'm still trying to figure out how Sarah got her rental car back if she hitched a ride back with someone else. As an aside, the teaser of her next release book sounds good, I'm sure I'll give it a read."
2,Worth noting! Old material,A lot has changed since this book was published in 1992. There are more up to date books availalbe. Buyer beware!
4,Boeing and Lockheed founders aviation accomplishments,"The video does a great job of sharing the accomplishments of William Boeing and Alan and Malcolm Longhead (founders of Lockheed). While made in 2005, the 95 minute video does not share much of the industry activities that in many cases shaped the priorities of these three aviation pioneers. For those seeking information about these three aviation pioneers this will be a great video. For those seeking video of events during aviation's golden years, you should also be delighted. For those as interested in the broader industries activities beyond Boeing and Lockheed, the video will leave you wanting more."
2,Would someone please de-clutter this book?,"While there was some helpful advice,it was hard to find, as it was buried under mounds and mounds of cutesy cartoons and anecdotes. Just get to the point, please!"
1,Same thing over and over!,"Not only does this book only tell you things that are common sense, it tells you every one of them at least 10 times. A complete and utter waste of time to read."
4,One Trick Pony-Great Music,"One Trick PonyGreat music for committed Paul Simon fans.Story very drawn out perhaps too realistic portrayal of band of musician's life on the road; lots of travelling, but being able at last to see this film especially of Paul Simon with his band playing some of his funkiest rock numbers - well worth it."
3,Fans will like it,"Let's face it. The movie isn't really good and Paul Simon isn't a good actor either. But his fans of course will like it anyway (as I did!)DVD with no menus, no subtitles, no extras, no scene selection. Just the movie. Disappointing..."
2,Not too bad,"This really isn't bad for someone who has never written a screenplay before, but if you don't like the style of music in the movie (which is pretty much ""Paul Simon after 1970"" style) there isn't much in this movie for you. A lot of his songs really do lack a hook, as one of the characters in the movies said, and this movie is categorized as a musical, which means the songs Jonah plays with his band fill up the majority of the time. I do have to credit Paul for the acting. He doesn't deserve an Academy Award but he wasn't bad at all. Overall this is a mediocre movie but if you're a Paul Simon fan and have 100 minutes to spare I'd say this is definitely worth one viewing."
2,DVD-R Recorded disc- BEWARE,"While the packaging is ok The Disc's are poor. This product was recorded not much better quality then if you downloded it as a bootleg and burned it to disc. I was very disappointed with the quality and this new format for reducing inventory.On the positive side, you do get to see a good movie from 20+ years ago that otherwise may not have been available.My disappointed is from someone who collects movies that the process for burning is very different than mass produced discs. It would be different if you were paying $10 for a downloaded version, or steaming but I feel the prioce for this poor quality is very bad business and somewhat misleading in the fine print for those who don't read slosely or aren't aware of the meaning of a recorded disc."
4,Corny but I like it.,Movie is kind of corny but I enjoy the music and the band. See Paul's new hair piece! Good cameos.
2,weak,"Not much happens in this film, and that which does is heavily padded with musical interludes.Good music. I bought the soundtrack album. But, still....Paul Simon wrote the script. I'm a writer, and artists from other disciplines often think they can just sit down and write a script with no apprenticing. They're wrong. Narrative fiction has rules and craft it takes a long time to master. Did you see artist Julian Schnabel's film he wrote about Jean Michele Basquiat BASQUIAT? A horrible film.Nonetheless, this film isan't charmless...and, hey, as a Lou Reed fan, it was fun to see him act, and especially act the part of a smarmy record executive!"
4,See how they shine on stage,"Sure, I can see why this movie flopped commercially. Paul failed to demonstrate as an appealing actor, which nobody ever hoped he would be. I felt high with music scenes and low with non-music scenes. But I still thoroughly enjoyed seeing Paul performing with Big Apple's top jazz musicians. Most of the songs he contributed for the movie were also fitting to the respective scene. This video, nonetheless, is recommended only to devoted fans of Paul Simon and STUFF, which I was."
2,Outdated,I am returning this book. It has not been updated in many many years. I was expecting a contemporary book on Purchasing.
4,A book with the good tips.,"As a beginner in the field of Purchasing,I found this book veryusefull and full with ""gemstones"" tips.The author has alot of experience to share with us,gives us anideas what to do,how and why.My only comment is on the lack of cost analysis examples."
4,"Good Material, lacked tests similar to MCAT","Very complete review of all sections. My major complaint was that the questions and passages were placed right after the material learned. This book is a good start on your road to the MCAT, but I would highly recommend more practice tests."
1,"Buyer, be aware!","This book seems to be a collection of public-domain material, printed only if you order it. It is a pain to deal with, because although the pages are numbered, the table of contents doesn't list any page numbers. It's just a big list of the stories and poems inside. So the only way to find any given story is to go foraging around and hope you find it. I plan to manually write in the page numbers myself. Also, there is no index.You may be better served to just go to wikipedia and print out any of the desired poems or stories yourself."
4,Relaxing With The Past,"Takes me back to my hometown in Colima, Mexico. Reminds me of my childhood with my mother. It's a must. Chelo Silva sings with passion and love."
2,Not recommended as a source for factual information,"As a biological anthropologist, I found this book readable, but far too full of straw-man type arguments. Nabhan mischaracterizes various hypotheses in biological anthropology, then cuts down the straw men with his own arguments. Rather than coming across as factually inaccurate, he could have and should have simply presented his own perspectives."
5,Fascinating,"Gary Nabhan explains why no one diet is going to work for everyone. This Norwegian-Cuban reviewer now understands her near addiction to milk, butter and cheese, as well as her love for hot, spicy, flavorful food. (Married to a super-taster, she also recommends ""food"" as an extremely important topic to include in premarital counseling. Or, reading this book for those who've already wed their food opposites.)"
3,Why some like it light,"The book is worth getting and reading, but it's hardly a book. It's really a bloated long article in the New Yorker of old, filled out to a small book with large margins. Even so, I did enjoy it."
2,Not a book to remember,"Parts of this book are worth reading. For example, the author claims the influence of genetics/food is bi-directional. I found this claim provocative.However, the rest of the book is uninspiring.Finally, I was puzzled that the author never addressed the claim that our taste buds have memories. (Whether he agreed or disagreed.) In other words, what we eat in our earliest moments of life, has an extremely strong influence on what foods we like (and eat) for the rest of our lives. This issue has been discussed in the science of nutrition and child rearing for many years now. Susan Robert's ""Feeding Your Child for Life Long Health"" is a great book that incorporates this fact into an every day guide for mom and dad. (I preferred Robert's first edition.)"
5,The Lettermen -- still going strong,"This disc is the perfect way to introduce the three part harmony sound of the Lettermen to anyone who has missed out on them thus far. All the essential hits are there, along with a fine version of ""Wind Beneath My Wings."" If you have a chance to see them perform live, do not miss it. Watch for them to release a new album of movie themes in the near future. Meanwhile, you can't go wrong buying this one."
3,A light read that occasionally gets riveting,"I looked forward to reading this book, the first full length Berserker novel I've read, having greatly enjoyed many short stories set in Fred Saberhagen's Berserker Universe. Perhaps there is some innate fear of artificial intelligent life we all share that makes the Berserker Universe so fascinating. Unfortunately either my tastes have changed over the years, or the longer format just doesn't have the same impact provided by the short story format. I found this book entertaining enough and there were certainly some exciting sections, but overall the book just didn't satisfy. Perhaps it is because the berserkers in this book are atypical (which makes them interesting but not so frightening), or perhaps because the book seems aimed at a young adult audience. Incidentally, congratulations to the cover artist; you've captured a key passage in the book extremely well."
3,berserker fan - long starving now somewhat full,"I've suffered through some mighty weak berserker novels since first discovering Mr. Saberhagen back in 1980. This novel is certainly the best in quite some time. Nevertheless its just 3 out of 5. I guess I have always preferred his Berserker short stories to the full length novels.I also liked Ardnehs sword, which was a recent addtion to the Empire of The East and the Swords stories. These two series have all been worthy books in novel length form and don't suffer from their length like the Berserker series. Between these two novels (Ardneh and Rogue) I now have some hope that Fred still has something to say in novel form."
5,Great video,My daughter now plays with all my old Charmkins toys and this movie is magical to her - she loves to see all the characters come to life on tv! Nice story about helping one another and being kind.
1,Not a Claddagh,"Poor quality, not a claddagh, there is no crown. You can see the seams, the hands on the band are terrible."
1,Piece of Junk,This ring is a piece of junk. The ring came chipped and the workmanship on the design was poor (i.e. some of the hands on the ring were smudged causing it to not look like a hand) I had to return this item; save your money.
2,Terrible book,"I was forced to buy this book as part of a Minorities in Society course. This book is terrible. The author obviously has an agenda and it bleeds over throughout the text. Although purported to be about various minority groups, it focuses on black males for the most part. Even the chapter on Gender (feminist issues), Sexual Preference, and Disability has a huge section on black males. The author continually blames the government and white males for every problem facing minorities. If you're a white male and want to understand why every social problem is your fault, this is the book for you. Otherwise, find something else."
3,Slow service,"I recieved this book 1 month after I ordered it. My test I was supposed to take had already passed before I could read the book. All of my other books were shipped to me in less than 2 weeks. Although, the book was in great shaped when I recieved it."
1,The worst single I've ever had!,"I want to sell mine!!! This single is terrible!! all the tracks are almost the same! You just can't hear it from the beginning to the end!!! It's horrible!!! The original song ""Human Nature"" is so good... but all of those mixes are a trash!!! I'd rather Bedtime Story Single!! That one is much better!"
2,She SHOULD be sorry!,"Hard core Madonna fans and collectors only: This collection of remixes is a bore. There are only two real remixes, which the other tracks are derived from (radio edits and dubs, yawn), and they aren't that great. Average club fare. Considering the original's hip-hop influence I was expecting mostly R&B mixes but none are to be found. This song was released after ""Bedtime Story"" which utterly bombed in America (peaked around 45 on the charts) so maybe Madonna was jaded and didn't bother to commission anything too great, I dunno. Not much more to say."
3,Not the best but...,"Human Nature is definetely not the best song of Madonna. And this Maxi CD confirms it. If most of the remixes are very crapy, track 8 is an excellent house music track, even if there's nothing from the original."
2,What A Shame...,"Human Nature is a great song. Its one of the more R&B flavored tracks on her Bedtime Stories album. However these remixes are pitiful. It isn't wise to turn a R&B song into a dance remix first of all, she could of made R&B or hip hop type remixes. That would of been good, but these are pitiful. Don't even waste your money on this, just be satisfied with the album version on Bedtime Stories, because thats the best you will hear of this song."
2,And I'm so sorry...,"...for purchasing this maxi. ""Human Nature"" is a fabulous song, in fact, I believe it to be one of her best singles. In fact, this song provides us with one of her best videos. But, then why in hell were the worst remixes possible commissioned for this maxi?!?!?I'd suggest buying the album from which this single comes, ""Bedtime Stories."""
5,The remixes are definitely very exciting!,These remixes affirm Madonna's commitment to the best dance grooves! The Howie Tee mixes are very urban sounding and the other mixes by Danny T. are hypnotizing!!!
4,"Gritty guitar, solid effort","As with any Trower release, this has some great guitar work on it. Mention has been made in other reviews about the last than stellar vocals and I agree. Having said that, if you like gritty blues and rock, this is a great CD to buy. You can order it from [...]along with some of his other more recent releases."
5,A DIFFERENT ( BETTER ? ) TROWER,"This CD proves that age doesn't weary them. This could have been recorded by a young / hotshot guitar slinger. The participants are young enough to be TROWERS off-spring. The raw energy flows freely from this CD and it sounds like rugged urban blues with an attitude. I would not have picked this as a TROWER CD. His attack on the guitar is a few notches heavier than in the past and provides a welcome edge to this CD. His tone is still as georgous as ever and his ability to play unconventional leads shines throughout. LIVINSTONE BRAMBLE provides some gut wrenching vocals and the backing is superb. I have all TROWER CD's and this one has shot straight to the top of the list.If you like BLUES / ROCK / GUITAR / TROWER , buy it. This is like a benchmark for this genre."
4,Solid Trower,"This is a fine offering from Trower. Very similar to his older releases. I really love the beautiful Hendrix feel to ""Precious Gift."" Trower is really cool, I wish he toured more often."
4,The final Fight is awesome.,"At the end of the movie, Jet fought with a tall American and fierce Japanese. It is both exciting and enteraining. If you love Jet, You will love the movie."
3,More funny than action...but in a good way,"Not sure if someone decided Jet Li needed to try to be more like Jackie Chan, but that's what this film felt like. Wonderful chemistry between Jet and his sidekick....some truly funny moments. I expected a lot more action, but got a lot more laughs. Not a bad rental. ...."
4,It's great! See it!,"I am a true fan of Jet Li films, and I have to say that this was a great movie! I'm getting tired of flicks that are comprised of no plot and no acting ability whatsoever. This movie had a great plot! The acting was good, and the character developement of Li in this movie was really good. I liked the fight scenes, although I wish there were a little more..."
2,The King of Killers falls short,"The latest outing The Hitman aka King of Killers, I'm sorry to say is just another one of those Flicks to pass up. Jet Li has had a recent dissapointing series of Films. Dr. Wai, OUTC 5, Last Hero in China. Then he came out with Lethal Weapon 4, and Blackmask. I thought the tide had turned. Good concept.. but no prize. Simon Yam is a nice treat in the movie though. On another note. The chroreography is good, and there's a good amount of gunplay"
3,Contract Killer,"I thought this would be more of an action movie than what it was, but with Jet Li in it I liked it enough to keep it."
1,hitman hit,"I love Jet Li and I'm sure this is a great movie, but my order for a region 1 copy has so far been ignored. JQ Books sent me a region 2 copy that is not compatible with American dvd players. I'm still hoping to resolve this."
3,Hong Kong Fu and weapons too,"The lead is pretty well played, but the voice over dubbing of the con manis just obnoxiously bad.As usual the hero survives where he should be dead many times over from all sorts of wounds. Action junkies will love this oneas there are very few slow spots."
1,Disc Destroyer,"I found Scratch Out at Walmart and decided to give it a try and see if it would remove some minor scratches from a PC game CD that would cause occasional pixilation.I should have taken a pass when the label actually says, ""Note: ScratchOut will leave your disc with a light haze, but will restore the disc to fully functional...""What the label doesn't say is that this haze is permanent. After that, the entire disc became unreadable. Three different PCs, on which the game previously played, could not even recognize this disc any more.In retrospect, I wish that the only fault with ScratchOut was that it just doesn't work. At least then, I would still have a playable CD game."
5,Works well if you know what you are doing.,"I picked this up for $5.00 at Office Max to fix a Xbox 360 game which was deeply scratched. I Xbox had flipped from the vertical position to the horizontal while I was playing the game which caused deep scratches, needless to say this made the disk unreadable. I was sure the game was gone, in fact I bought a new copy but had second thoughts about throwing the old copy away. I took a chance despite some negative reviews...I'm glad I did now I can give the other copy to my brother. The key of the product seems to be the amount you use and the cloth you use to buff the scratches, if you don't use enough the cloth will scratch the hell out of the disk."
1,avoid unless you love a seriously scratched disc,"Bought this product a few days ago. Although i tried different soft cloths with it, the result was exactly the same, a load of swirly scratches over the discs, luckily i didn't pay much for them. I hadn't put much pressure on while using it to mend the origional scratches, so has to be the product. there is a product from england from a company called Bib thats almost the same, just better results, but if i remember rightly was a bit pricy, look for that."
5,Repaired 4 of 5 Dreamcast Games,"I had five different Dreamcast games that were really scratched up. Three of them didn't work at all and the other two would freeze at certain points in the game. I used ""Scratch Out!"" on them and now four out of the five work perfectly! The one that I couldn't fix did get to the menu though, which is farther than it got before. As some of the other reviewers have said, it does seem to create a lot of small scratches on the disc but they don't cause any issues. This stuff works great but don't expect it to make your discs look like new!"
1,Never has worked once in 3 years,"I bought this 3 years ago to fix a game cd that had minor scratches on it but that wouldn't install. Alas after over an hour of following the directions over and over on the back, the cd didn't work and looked destroyed. A year later the same story several more times. Today I hoped that it could fix another game cd with minor scratches. NOPEIT'S A SCAM AND A WASTE OF 30 BUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"it's ok, toothpaste works just as well.","it's a polish, it won't fill deep scratches that cause the real problems. You can use toothpaste the same way you use this product with the same results."
2,didn't work,"This product did not work for me, to repair a scratched disk. I believe the tube I was sent was way too old, ""expired""... The substance seemed very liquidy and not ""paste"" like... The bottle was 1/2 empty... so I don't know if it somehow evaporated over the years, or that's just how it is... It may work for others but it certainly did not repair the few disks I had that were scratched, from lightly to severely... toothpaste worked"
1,Avoid this junk at all costs!,"Don't get this item! It totally destroyed my disks, so I had to get new ones. Whoever made this junk should be totally ashamed of themselves!"
1,Worst thing I ever bought on Amazon,"There's clearly something wrong with this stuff. They probably don't make it anymore and for good reason. It probably never worked. Mine was watery with chunks in it. Somehow, I don't think it was manufactured that way. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Does not work.,"I purchased this product from Walmart. I followed instructions four times hopeing it would work, it did not. Not even close. My MW3 must hit the can. I knew it was to good to be true."
5,Amazing Product!!!!!!,"I had to write a review because I am just so ecstatic about the results!! For my 3 year anniversary I wanted to put together a video of pictures, including photos from the wedding. When I found the disc they were on I found that my daughter had gotten a hold of it somehow and completely scratched it. I purchased a tube of scratch out and after I applied it, per the directions, I put the CD back in the drive and it read perfectly!! Since then I have dug up all my old CD's and DVD's and have repaired them all! The only ones I couldn't repair had actual cracks which could not be repaired. If you have tried this product and didn't like it, mostly likely your disc's were cracked beyond repair too or you are not following directions because I absolutely love this product and it has proven its ability to fix scratches over and over again. Also worked fantastic on our playstation games!!! Thank you scratch out!!!"
1,Scratch Out More Like Scratch In!!,THIS THING MESSED UP HALF OF MY FAMILY GUY DISCS. DO NOT BUY THIS THING. IT WILL SCRATCH UP YOUR DISC INSTEAD OF HELPING TO REMOVE THE SCRATCHES. ONLY USE FOR DISC'S THAT DON'T WORK FOR SURE ANYMORE PERIOD. IT THING WILL LEAVE YOUR DISC IN WORSE CONDITION THAN IT WAS IN TO THE POINT YOU CAN NOT SELL YOUR DISC AT A PAWN SHOP. THING IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WANT GET DISCS LOOKING GOOD OR PRETTY FOR SELLING OR FOR SHOWCASING.

5,Buy It,"Both films are filled with great dialog and scenes.Don't look for great acting, but fun movies.The Euro Trip will leave you singing ""Scotty Doesn't Know""."
1,dvd did not even work.,"Company said they would send a new one, but I haven't seen it yet. All you can expect of a used DVD is that it plays. this one didn't make it two minutes. Not good quality control IMO."
1,Scratched,"Disk was scratched, skips a lot. The only reason I kept it is because I tossed the receipt."
3,It's Ok.,"It's not the highest quality but it works. The spout had a crack upon arrival but I needed it for that weekend so I used it anyway. I don't see it lasting more than this season, if that."
2,Was great until the handle tore,"The accordion design is handy when pouring. You just open the spigot and push down. +2 stars for the form factor.However, after only a couple uses, the handle tore on mine where it meets the top of the body. Too bad the quality is so poor as I liked this when it was intact. But, I won't be buying another one. -3 stars for the quality."
5,Awesome! replacement battery,Everything worked just like they said it would. Now unit is better than new. I had written off my IPAQ but going strong now
5,Great battery.,This battery was a good replacement for the dead one in my iPAQ. Best of all it comes with more runtime (2200mAh) than the original battery which is good. It also comes with a tool to open the iPAQ and was very simple to install.
4,Worth your buy!,"This is a good product. It lasted me a long time and it is pretty good at what it does. Just do your best to charge it up full once in a while. In short, it's a usable product. I recommend it."
3,Beware,"The reviewer that stated that these songs are remastered IS correct - contrary to the many people saying otherwise. Smiling Faces, while decent enough, has been redone. The end result is that it's too orchestrated and overly ""smooth"". It has lost a lot of it's original bite."
1,Remastered,"The songs - Smiling Faces, Papa was a Rolling Stone, & Ball of Confusion, soundedvery foreign to me. I took a second look at the cd cover & noticed it said Remastered. I was looking for the original sound of the songs, as they were played on the radio in 1971. If you dont mind the remastering, and you just love the words I guess you would like this cd. But if your looking for the original sound as played on the radio, this will not please you."
4,"No frills, no spills, but....","All I wanted was a plain ol watch, nothing fancy, nothing complicated (believe me, I have a few of those). This is just what the doctor ordered. Plain and simple. Minute hand, hour hand, and second hand. But wait, what's this? Indiglo? Cool, push the stem and the watch lights up. Neat. Ah, it hacks too. Ok so two frills, haha. If it didn't have these frills I'd be happy too. Lightweight and keeps good time. Looks good. Long battery life. Can't complain at all. I really like this watch."
4,Pretty good watch!,"Easy to read, simple to operate. The band might need replacement before the watch. I'd buy these again."
4,Can't read the date but a nice watch,"Nice watch, easy to read numbers but have others have stated it's almost impossible to see the date. For that reason I gave it 4 stars, nice watch for the money."
4,get it if you are buying a watch to tell time,"If you wear a watch to display a brand of a piece of jewelry, DO NOT buy this watch. If you want an analogue watch that is water resistive, easy to read and can be seen in the dark, this is a great buy. My last one (same model, band, etc) only lasted 10 years and it took a while to find the exact model again. Worth looking for. The price is great and if it gets damaged or broken, not the end of the world."
5,Timex Excellence,"Fulfilled all my simplistic needs. Nylon velcro watch band, analog face, push-crown for Indiglo action and priced very affordably. Strong recommendation."
1,Lousy wristband ruins it all,"The watch is decent and works well. The watchband wore otu after a few months and is diffcult to replace. Most jewelers don't carry this kind of band. I think I have to order one online, and pay postage. It kind of destroys the value of the watch."
5,it takes a licking and keeps on ticking,"You can't find a better value than this rugged and reliable watch. This is my third expedition watch and my umpteenth Timex. In 35+ years of wearing them, I have never been disappointed in any Timex that I've owned. The only reason I ever replace one is because I'd just as soon have a brand new watch than buy a just a new strap."
3,okay watch,"ok very simple watch, ticks too loudly. i bought it to have a watch during tests but ended up not using it because of distracting ticking"
2,cool on looks/not on durability,"I like the looks of the Timex sport watches and have had a few and found them to be sub par, even at the low price. In my case, the backs came off.I have Casios of similar vintage and type and style and have had no problems."
3,"looks nice, but vulnerable cover and scratchy band","I like this watch, overall.Pros:1. Crisp, clear face numbers.2. Easy to set date/time.Cons:1. nylon band.I have been used to a resin band (for over 10 years), so switching to nylon was immediately felt by me. The band seems scratchy to my skin. I suppose it will get better over time.2. plastic watch face.It is raised, off the face of the watch, without protection, so it seems easily vulnerable to sratches. And indeed, within 24 hours, a sratch has occured to the face. I'm not sure how over time this will play out.I can't tell if this is the same situation with the Timex Men's Camper Watch #T18581, which was the other watch I was considering to buy."
3,Not the same as the picture,"The watch that I received wasn't quite like the picture shown here. In the picture the watch has a white background with black numerals. That was fine. The picture also shows the date to be white with black numbers. Mine was the reverse of that - black background with white numbers. It was impossi le for me to read the date.As usual, Amazon was terrific about the return."
4,Timex expedtion has its ups and downs,"just got this watch yesterday as my first one that came from amazon was a dud. evertime i tried to set time going counterclockwise knob would unscrew. Also amazon's customer service was horrible, shipping of the broken watch was 2 days late and amazon couldnt seam to understand that, refunded my shipping (reluctantly) and couldnt even do that right. Next watch is fine (as far as i know).i like the face its really nice, watch band seams ultra cheap but thats replacable. Ticks loudly, almost like dripping water(yes its that loud). I like that for this low price you get time and date with backlight that actually works quite well. overall watch gets 4 stars and amazon gets one star. i would reccomend buying this watch from target or timex as their cutomer service departments are well suited for actually servicing cutomers and not lining their pockets.pricing will be alightly higher but i'll pay 10$ anyday to not have to deal with amazon's customer care again. thanks"
1,"Neat weapon, uninspired gameplay.","I just rented this game (and trust me, that's all you'll want to do), and found it to be a bore fest.There are some cool ideas such as being able to destroy just about all the environments you come accross, yet you seem to do more battle with the buildings and columns than you do with the enemies... why you ask? because there are none! I've just about beaten the game (in less than 6 hours I might add), and I've only ran into 5 types of enemies!No enemies, anywhere... yet so many cool moves with you Diskarmor...Yet no one to use them on! Oh, and don't even think about using them on a boss, cause it just don't work.Avoid purchase of this game. It makes a good rental however..."
3,rygar,this game was ok. i mean the graphics are unbelievable and the fighting sequence is killer but the game is extremely short. it only took me 3 hours to beat this game and the only replay value this game has is playing the game again on a harder mode. that's it. might i suggest renting the game?
1,save your money,"this game is horrible. even the cheesiest voice acting from resident evil one was at least amusing. this makes me want to punch someone in the face.i feel like i was robed, and am glad that i bought it used. i really liked the old one, but this new one has firmly peed on its grave."
5,This version may or may NOT be the original,"The Nintendo verison of Rygar was an excellent game, I agree with the first reveiwer. It had a great sound track(some NES games had the best music I've heard in games) and wicked levels and sinister enemies like the shadowlords in the cloud fortress. Hopefully the Flaming Disk wheapon will be in this too.(probably a higher level wheapon) on the PS2 box Rygar has a shield and probably a sword of some kind to start with. Hopefully you will be able to save. In the original you could not save. (I had to keep the NES powered while I rested between playing.) I should probably e-mail my brother about this PS2 version..."
3,I have a problem with this book^....,"At first I thought what many of you seem to be thinking, maybe they are going to breed Prancer. But then I was thinking^in the earlier books (Saddle Club #27) when Dorothy comes to Pine Hollow with a new stallion the girls are trying to think of who would be a good match and Lisa suggests Prancer, to which Carole replied she would not be a good choice because of the pedal bone fracture. How can she be ok to breed now? SaddleClubFan@hotmail.com"
5,These are GREAT!,"I love this enw series. I just started reading Saddle Club books the summer of '99 and I've already read like half the series (yeah, i have ALOT of spare time.). I saw the first 5 books lying in my friends room and she gave them to me, so I read them. They are GREAT! They might not talk so much about the horses, but they talk about REAL issues in someone's life and these are WAY more real. I love them all, but these are more real. This one, #4 was my fav. I love the part where Stevie is yelling at Scott!"
3,changing leads,"In this book, Lisa is still in California, trying to make up her mind whether to return. Back home, Stevie is dealing with Callie's brother's anger, as she was driving the night of the accident. The group of friends is also getting worried about their friend A.J., who has been uncharacteristically tense and testy. Meanwhile Carole must decide whether or not to keep a secret that would affect Lisa."
2,Quality control issue,"I heard great things about Meprolight, and it was cheaper than Trijicon by $30 give or take so I decided to try them.2 years ago I bought Trijicons for my P99 and they installed very easily.I recently bought a 2nd P99 and needed night sights for it. When the Meprolights came in, they looked similar to the Trijicons. The only problem was when they were installed, the front sight had a lot of play. The front sight wiggled like a loose tooth, but it wasn't because of the sight itself, but the screw that secures it. The screw's threads were not fully threaded, thus preventing the screw to fully tighten down to the slide.I have no doubt that Meprolight makes great products, but I want to believe I just got a bad batch.I returned the product and plan to buy Trijicons again."
1,insane price,"Paying almost $90 for two very little pieces of plastic is insane. Compared to the price of any Walther, $90 is insanely high. These sights are about 20% of the price of a whole Walther pistol. Think about that, 20% of the price of a new gun is in two tiny little pieces of plastic, The rest is in the metal and composite of the slide, spring, barrel, grip, trigger, 2 magazines, and the whole firing mechanism including the firing pin. This product should be around $20 at best."
5,Cd Pesado-Mil Historias,"Love my CD, has a lot of the songs I love. ONe of the best albums from Grupo Pesado. Love it."
4,great for beginners,"This is a great bike maintenace book for beginners. The photos and directions are very easy to follow. The techniques they describe are not fancy and do not require expensive tools. For more complex jobs, they tell you to visit your bike shop, which is probably what a beginner should be doing. Intermediate-to-advanced home mechanics should look at the Zinn or Park books instead."
5,Fast shipping. Great Book,My husband wanted this book and was surprised when I got it so reasonably and fast. Thank you!
2,It was ok. But the Park Tool Is a lot Better!!,"I bought this hoping it would have some Information about the 7 or 8 Speed Internal Rear Hubs. Like what the Electra Townie 8 has and what the Jamis Hudson #3 has and it has a 7 speed But there Is Nothing. Also there is nothing about fixed gear hubs, Plus on there braking there is Nothing. At least the Park Tool Big Blue Book Has some Information a Lot better than Nothing!! The person that said the Haynes manual was better must like the pretty green cover. That's why I bought this cause that person said it was better than the Park Tool but It is Not!! Save your money If you have a Townie or a Jamis Hudson #3 Internal Rear Hub. This manual is a lot like there car manual's. They take you right up to where you need to be, Then you have to guess the rest. I have been a Mech for 38 years It is a pretty Green. But the Blue looks! Better to Me."
4,A good place to start,"This is a great book for beginners and there are plenty of photos to assist the reader together with step by step instructions. On the downside, as noted in other reviews, the technologies covered seem a little bit dated and seem to have a bias toward the 1990s or earlier, for example my headset/stem are not covered. Some of the page layouts are a bit jumbled in places, but on the whole it is easy follow."
4,Handy Book To Have,"If you're new to bicycle repair and maintenance, then this is a pretty handy book. Especially if you're like me and have never dealt with a multi-speed bicycle before. The only problem I saw with it, is that they keep advising you to use WD-40 for a lot of the lube points on a bicycle.While WD-40 is a fantastic product for other applications, everything I've read in regard to bicycle maintenance tells you to avoid using lubricants, like WD-40, to lubricate your bicycle. From what I gather they have solvents in them that help flush out dirt, but it also cuts and removes oil that is much better at protecting your parts from wear and tear, especially the chain and sprocket.But other than that, I found the Haynes Bicycle Book to be a handy book to have in your garage."
1,Whackkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Is this guy kidding or what!! The title of this album is lyricism 101, this guy is so whack , all he talks about is doing drugs and how burnt he is , and his name is tommynocker, how lame is that? If he wants to know what real lyricism is, then he needs to get a copy of god loves ugly (atmosphere) , anything by copywrite , soul position , aseop rock, murs , yak ballz, this album is a joke!!! he talks about approaching people on the street and battling them , ill rip this guy a new one."
4,good except...,The fan is very loud and high pitched. Teaming adapters worked in 64bit WinXP but I can't seem to make it work in 64bit WinVista. There is no tab for it.
1,description doesnt match item,This was not what the item description stated. So I am extremely unsatisfied they are much smaller than described.
4,3 piece?,its wasn't 3 piece at all it was TWO they should change that or send me the third piece that randomly wasn't sent.
5,Loved it!,"I loved this book. The author really knows how to tell a good story and has a love of animals. It really is a good read. I could identify with the lead character except for the medical details. I look forward to reading other books in this series. There are not many books that address both animals and detective work. I would highly recommend it. Also, the language is really clear, as if she were talking directly to you."
3,Help Me,"Im looking for the instrumental that plays in the background of the bad boys 2 dvd and the instrumental that continuosly plays throughout the movie, it sounds like a dr dre did it but i cant find it anywhere....Thank You in advance"
2,One word........... bad!,"I love the series but the movie..... how can I put this in words, I know it sucks, big time. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because the art is lovely. Even though you will see alot of red.(blood)Their trying to put so much in 100 min. It's just dumb. The only thing I could get out of the stroy was that their is a battle between two sides. And some guy (not the guy on th cover) was after some sword in a girls body, and the only way to get the sword is to kill her. Did I forget to say that they are bother and sister!!! (danm, talk about faimly problems) So just don't be foold by the preety face it's a bad moive. And two more things, I rented this, and get the series it's much better."
4,great anime with small problems,"A great anime based on one of the best selling mangas by CLAMP. The story revoles around Kaumi, a boy with the power to decide the fate of earth. He can become a dragon of the heavens and protect earth or become a dragon of the earth and recreate earth. A great anime and a must see if you are interested in learning about the series or CLAMP. There are a few problems however, the anime is a little old and it can be seen in the quality of the animation. also this story spands 6 graphic novels and so it is needless to say that some things were left out when they turned this into a movie (Character development for example). lastly i dont recomend this for small kids as it is bloody and graphic at certain points. I strongly suggest this anime"
2,This movie is okay,"X is not one of the high flyers on my anime flag. You have to watch it a number of times to get the entire plot, but it's not too complicated. There's alot of action and almost too much bloodletting, a few of the deaths were unnecessary. Kids should steer clear of this one, because of it's intense violance and brief nudity, but any anime fan who likes a movie with decapitation and such, should check this one out."
2,Can things get any cornier?,"With a ""cool"" name like ""X,"" you wouldn't know what to expect. I saw this movie in a theatre, not on the DVD, and let me say I was highly disappointed. The animation was OK, the plot seemed to have potential, but it was never fulfilled. It had so many loop holes that you were left confused when it's ended."
2,The Series is better,"This movie is a waste of your time. I saw X in the theater and was horrified by the bad dubbing. The series is a much better pick. You get to know the characters more and the story is more interesting. Trying to cram so much info (or leaving lots out, whichever you prefer) in two hours was a waste of money and time."
2,I don't know....,"I wanted to like this movie. Beautiful animation and action sequences, but it made absolutely no sense. as someone else said in another review, there was very little story or character development and gratuitous nudity. I felt like I was watching a soft porn disguised as art. It left me scratching my head in some confusion."
1,"By the series, not the movie","I watched the series first. Then I tried to watch this... I didn't make it through. I was so disoriented... I'd heard there was a different ending to the movie than the series so I was curious... But again, I didn't make it through and didn't care enough to make it through either."
2,X-Before the Series,"I saw this after seeing hte X Series, and from the look of the naimation, how some things differ from this to the series, I believe this is what X the series was based on. The ending is different, and some of the characters have changed slightly, even parts of ths story have changed a bit.The overall feeling of this movie, however, left me feeling disappointed. It ended so suddenly and seemed too quick for the seriousness of what this is based around. This was released a year before the first X series DVD was released, which leads me to believe X the series ws a result of this to deepen the story where this one lacked it.I was disappointed with how this seemed to be rushing through everything to get to the final ending which was lacking. Exciting none the less, it is sitll X, which I greatly enjoy, however never plan to see this again, once was more than enough to compare the series to this."
3,"I gave this movie a ""passing"" grade b/c I am a fan of X","I have just finished watching this movie and would like to say the following:If you HAVE SEEN the TV series(like myself), I wouldn't be surprised if you were a bit disappointed by the movie. Personally, I don't want to blame it on the 100-minute time constraint, rather, I think it was the director who had failed to interpret the story(well, maybe it has to do with the fact that the manga was not yet completed that time?).If you HAVE NOT SEEN the TV series and want to know why everything happened the way they happened(yeah, I know, you tried your best to figure it out...), PLEASE GO SEE THE TV SERIES (24 episodes). You will get better story-telling and character-building and of course, same excellent music score and fighting scenes. Oh, btw, expect a much more touching ending also! (girls, get your klinex ready)Advice to ladies of CLAMP: make up your minds.Enough said, ciao."
4,The real reason I learnt Japanese,"I am a manga reader so when I found out (at volume 15 of the manga) that X had been made into an anime I waited patiently for what I thought was a series, instead they made a movie. I was skeptical, the manga itself is massive but this blew me away. Its hard to review it and not give any spoilers, its so compact, but I cried when I finished this. Okay so half the characters are missing and the story is condensed, but like a can of Campbells soup, it only works for the better. You could not watch this film once, there's too much information, you have to buy it and watch it again and again and again, and you'll want to. When Arashi pushes the sword from her own hand is one of the most beautiful scenes in anime. Although the artists are responsible for Card captor Sakura, this one's definitely not for kids."
3,lacked authenticity,"This dvd definitely lacked something... it's always dancing around the subject. And when it came time to finally deliver the goods, the great fight scenes, or the true insights, there was none. The hereos and villans were killed off as soon as you just began to know them. Overall, I'd say more time is needed for character development, also putting more explosive, and stunning fight scenes, which extends one's imagination, couldn't hurt."
2,Kills an hour or so.,"If you just have to watch it buy it used or rent. After watching it once its not worth a second viewing. It all goes by so fast that you don't have time to care about any of the characters or if any of them live or die for their cause. However, I do recommend the TV series."
4,Manga stuff!,"It was a good movie for its time. I liked that one sceen were this character made these rocks tern into crows. But other than that ""X"" was an ok action anime with a few majic tricks up its sleave. I laugh at the cheasy voice acting. I would have liked to see proper use of the swords in the sword fight battles, like seeing skillful martial arts used to move and slash each character agenst his/her aponnent. Other than that, I cant complain about the graphics in ""X"". It was made in the early 1990's."
2,could have been worse...but not by much...,"So the series is fantastic! Lots of character development etc. to make you just LOVE all the characters (no matter how evil they are). The movie...yeah...about that. They developed two characters (the main two, Seishirou and Kamui) and they didn't even do a good job. Not only that but they kill off two supporting characters in the first five minutes. The only entertainment value this has is for drinking games involving counting how many times Kotori dies.The series is worth watching. The movie...well...that's your choice..."
2,An Epic Let Down,"I used to own the Unflipped Manga, and recently replaced my copies. Rereading it inspired me to buy the movie. I knew it would not compare with the beautiful art by the CLAMP artists but the movie was horrible. The sense of plot you can get by reading the Manga was destroyed harshly, though the frame work of the idea is still there vital details are missing and so it misleads you about the entire goal. There is utterly no character development and its a dispassionant episode that is hastily thrown together. The art is still beautiful, but that is all. The imbalance causes collossal dissatisfaction."
2,"So Sorry, But I Just Simply Had To Say This...","Well, just the other night I rented this movie from Anime Planet, not able to get the 7th volume of the series (had already seen 1-5). So I watched the 6th volume which I had also rented and I was amazed. I just love the X series. And once I was done with it...I watched this.So sorry to all of you bigbigbig fans, but I was quite disappointed.The manga rocked hard and I simply adore the series. But this movie was so- pointless that it's making my insides burn. I'm extremely sorry, but watching this was torture. The series is GREAT! This...isn't.In other words, I hated it.Go readers; go X-fans...go see the series for the first time or again. Go read the manga. Just...just don't watch this. It will simply destory your view on X.Oh, and to to all of those who love this movie; simply sorry. I just had to write this to get the burning out of my chest."
3,"Not the best, but a few very redeeming points.","I have watched this movie 3 times, and there is a lot that I still don't understand. If you're familliar with anime, think Akira for comprable complexity. However, I own it for one simple reason: the imagery. The animation is good (though not the best I've seen), but the imagery in many of the scenes is absolutely spectacular. Things that happen, or appear to happen, have very deep meaning beyond simply what they show. This all feeds into the overriding Good vs. Evil and Man vs. Nature themes within this movie. I would give specific examples, but I don't want to spoil too much. However, I can say within the first 5 minutes you will see what I mean. Definately worth a rent, probably worth the buy."
3,It's alright,"Wonderful artwork but if you're not paying very close attention, you will get completely lost in the storyline. This anime makes your brain work very hard as you try to figure out what is going on most of the time. Much of it is in a dream sequence and you'll be relieved once the dream is over so that things wont be so confusing. The main characters are Kamui and Fuuma. I've only read a few of the mangas but it appears they are a yaoi couple. I've seen several pictures online where they are clearly homosexuals but I'm not sure if those are official pictures. If they are a couple it sadly was not portrayed in this movie. They are dubbed as being just friends."
2,Pathetic Plot,"This movie did not fulfill my expectations. X is a paradigm example of anime: nice art, nice concepts, bad story telling. X's plot resembles a mere plot proposal: a structure but no originality, no character development, and no literary complexity. I felt like I was watching a video game laden with bad one-liners (eg. ""An impressive force shield, but is it really necessary?"")The opening scene revealed some potential (although it was soaked in Freudian metaphors), but the story went downhill from there. If you're an anime fan because of violence and nudity then this film is for you. If you're an anime fan because the first anime you watched was something like Akira, then this is not for you."
1,This movie STUNK,"The animation and storyline held such promise, but the plot just got so BORING: read SLOW and Melodramatic.Some of the cheesy lines pierced my very being and left irreperable damage. PLEASE, for your sake, do NOT buy this movie! I might even recommend not wasting your time even RENTING this movie its THAT BAD."
1,X _ X,"When I first saw X in a store I thought ""Cool, a new anime"", but I was smart enough to rent it first... to say the least I've seen a less jumpy & more enticing plot in the writtings of a kindergardener. The movie was so shallow that I watched it with no sound, and fast foward and I could swear I didn't miss a beat of the damn plot. ""oh no, they're gonna get the dragons. ha I have found them... no let me use my psychic powers to make a big stupid polygon over 5 blocks of a city... yea..."" That is in fact the entire movie. IT'S MORE REPETATIVE THAN DRAGON BALL Z!"
3,SLOW!,"WELL, THE BAD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT IS WAY TO SLOW. YOU CAN'T WONDER WHY THE WASTE SO MUCH TAPE FOR SO MUCH STUPID THINGS. YOU WON'T SEE ANY ACTION UP TO THE FINAL 20 MINUTES, AND FOR A MANGA MOVIE IT LACKS GORE AND NUDITY. DONT MIND THE NUDITY (WHICH IS KIND OF STUPID FOR AN ANIME), BUT THE GORE, WHERE THE GORE WENT? IF YOU ARE NOT A ANIME FAN, DONT START WITH THIS, RENT IT AND IF YOU LIKE IT, THEN BUY IT."
3,"Not great, but interesting if you've seen the series.","I enjoyed parts of this movie, but that is only because I have seen parts of the series.You can read any review here about the movie. It isn't that good.The only thing I would advise you do is not watch this if you plan to watch the series. I now know the ending to the series, which is kind of unfortunate. This badly paced movie is too rushed to deal with the complex characters in the manga/tv series. Watch the series first and learn about the characters. Then maybe you should watch this movie as a goof."
1,movies like this make me long for a zero star rating,"horrendous. this is a glaring example of why any Manga that lasts over 100 pages should be made into a series and not a movie (Akira nonwithstanding). you can see that the characters all have traits and personalities, but we dont get a chance to really know any of them before they are all promptly killed off. and yes, i do mean ALL killed off. one, count em, one main character survives this convoluted debacle. i cant wait to see what they do with the series, cause they certainly cant do any worse."
3,X the Movie Review,"I liked the movie. But...the series is 100 times better. The movie is too short and there isnt enough character development. You are introduced to a character and shortly after, that character dies. Everyone dies, except Kamui...it's like a blood bath. Now, I could of over looked all that and gave this product 4 stars...but something else kinda annoyed me. Subaru and Seishiro are only in one scene that lasts about 3 minutes and they both die! Ok, that I can't stand. That's why this movie only gets 3. Now! Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, it isn't bad, its just too short."
3,"X is a good movie, but it leaves you amazed and confused","I have not yet had the pleasure to read CLAMP's graphic novels of X, but I have heard good things. I believe they will help the stuff that doesn't seem to get explained well in the movie. Even with some holes in the plot and character development it is still a great movie. Really gripping animation and a very interesting storyline seems to draw the audience in quickly. If you love crazy anime, you will like this one, but you will be rather confused at the end. To really get your questions answered you should pick up the X TV Series DVDs that are now becoming available. Together you should not be disappointed. Keep the faith, dEx"
2,Huge disapointment.....,Wow this one was really boring. It sort of picked up in the end but just didnt have enough to make this one a fun film to watch. The art work was amazingly gorgeous but that was about it. That is why I gave it a 2 star. This just did not have enough action or plot to make it even close to being a 5 star. I was excited about watching this one in the movies but it didnt get into theaters where I live and I was looking at what it made in the U.S. and it didnt make really anything and so I started to wonder what in the world was wrong and now I know. This film is just plain boring.
2,A beautiful piece of junk,"This movie has beautiful art, but lacks any character development, an understandable plot, and a satisfying ending. Apparently, the author wasn't even finished writing the manga before this movie was published. The ending was so abrupt and horribly done, I was left staring dumbly at the tv as the ending credits rolled by.A RAY OF HOPE!!!! The official Pioneer Animation site...has announced it will be releasing the first volume of the X TV Series in the fall!! I have seen most of this series already (including the ending) and I am itching to get my hands on it. Very well done, beautiful art, character development, and a satisfying ending!! Save your money for this series."
2,"Pretty, but empty","X is nice looking, but has litle substance. The plot and characters will be somewhat confusing for viewers unfamiliar with the manga, because little effort is spent on exposition. There's not a lot of plot, but once it gets rolling, it's quite predictable. The characters are well designed, but not well developed as characters. They kill each other. Will the earth be saved? There's little in this formulaic film to make one care."
2,What the hell.....,"Personally I love good looking anime, and this movie is very good looking. But this movie had a super complex start, and it gets worse from there. Don't get attached to any one character because no one has a happy day in this flick. It is very depressing and just hard to watch, if you do get it and want some huge climatic battles, you sorta get that, but not in the way you would expect, its just mainly the grunts floating around killing each other. Personally I think they tried a bit to hard on this film, sometimes simple is better. Hear they just made everything complex and really hard to swallow. If your looking for a good looking anime with a super complex plot, this is a gem. But if you don't want to think and become depressed when you watch it avoid this one. Hard to follow, sums this film up pretty quick."
5,"Nothing like the books, but damn good!","This reminds me of the Rayearth OAVs, set in an alternate universe & is considerably more morbid. (& yet again I wonder what's with CLAMP's <esp. Nanase's> constant obsession with obliterating Tokyo<Toukyou>Since the book series is still ongoing (& yet going nowhere-_-) it would be difficult to fit all the pieces togeather without already knowing something about the series. (ps, there is a new X1999 series currently in Japan.)"
3,too much told (or untold) in too little time,"Let's first place this in context -- X is actually a considerably detailed story ... at least in the written form (the manga). Transitioning it to a movie though, leaves too little time. There's a slew of characters, most of which simply aren't developed at all due to time constraints. Mind you, we do have beautiful art and good music, and the underlying story is a good one. But this anime, like many, fails in the budget department. It would have been better released as a long OVA series. Instead, we're left with 5-star potential, 4-star production quality, and a 2-star transition to the screen. A pretty movie, worth watching, but in the long run disappointing for what it could have been, given (considerably) more running time."
4,short reasons why this movie is lacking,"it kills women which is sick i mean even in evangelion didn't have that much disgusting killing the story was kind of quick compared to the manga which sounded more interesting as a happy ending fan and since Kamui was dealing with God's power, the people he cared for should have came back to life not remembering what happend"
3,Confused,"Let me be honest, I have watched this movie several times, and I think I finally get it, but it makes almost no sense. Good movie though, and seeing it made me watch many times, I guess I should rank it higher, but I was so lost after the first viewing I really can't."
2,X the Movie.,"This movie is very different from the manga, but it's supposed to be, because the makers wanted to be sure the movie had an ending, even though the manga is yet to be completed. It is very well done taking that into consideration and I found some of the fights scenes intriguing, because they moved slowly. Unlike fight scenes that I'm used to, which are very fast and furious, at least the first fight with Kamui against Nataku and the other man (Gomen, his name escapes me right now) was very slow and had a very strange but very interesting feel to it that I enjoyed a LOT. It can be very depressing, but still is an excellent movie and worth looking into."
1,really the worst anime ever,"I like anime. I hated this movie. I saw it in a theatre with a group of 4 or 5 anime fans and we all felt stupid we blew $9 on this sub-par garbage. We all sat around afterward ridiculing the final shot (one character cradles another character's decapitated head in his hands while crying--pathetic.) Do not buy nor rent this crap. I won't bother describing the ""plot"" (OK I will: Freaky dream sequence, Dragon of Heaven fights Dragon of Earth and gets killed, Freaky dream sequence, Dragon of Heaven fights Dragon of Earth and gets killed, Repeat, Repeat, Decapitation, Boo-hoo, End credits, you realize you're $9 poorer.)"
1,A mindless mess of puddly black goo....,"That seems a little strong when describing a movie. That is however what this movie seems to me. It was bad enough when theyk illed off Subaru within 5 minutes of the movie! Come on! They said they based this off of Clamps work?! More like stole the characters and pasted them onto a completely different plot line.Yes the animation was good,but the story developed to fast with no real plot. They didn't even do a semi-good job in developing characters. Your left with a dry taste in your mouth after watching it. Not to mention the ending really sucked.The only good thing about it is the squishing noises made whenever someone got their arm teared off or a sword ran through them(very nice indeed!).Listen if you want a nice looking anime that doesn't follow the plot of even the tv series then watch this...otherwise don't bother. You will only be sorry you did."
2,this is the series but told in 100minutes,"like i said, this is the series but told in 100 minutes that you really don't have much time to actually know what's going on. I've seen it in english and i thought it was alright. I watched it in Japanese to see if maybe it'd be a little different but NO, its the same confusion of which destiny will the main characater,Kamui, choose. The animation itself is pretty good i think and the ending song is great. But really the ending pretty much sucked, and as for the end of the world? Yah its pretty much a lousy end as not much fighting took place with Kamui and his twin star,Fuma. The series is better i believe but even the ending to the series lagged alot."
2,It's good but.....................,"The movie had one major flaw, too short. They took a story that should've taken 3-4 hours and crammed it into 1 and a half. To cut back on time everybody died quickly. Watch the series instead. It's the same thing but longer. Trust me, you won't be disapointed."
3,Much too short...,"I can't wait til the OAV of this gets translated or fansubbed. This movie squished 15-or-so volumes of manga, the story of which hasn't even ended yet, into 90 mins of tape. Fun to look at, but very little character development, and less explanation of what is going on."
2,For a 90min movie covering this manga what do expect,X: The Movie wasn't what I expected it to be actually I hated it. After the first time I saw it I literally buried it somewhere in the deep bowels of my room. I mean the beginning isn't something that keeps you wanting to see the rest of the movie but if you do happen to continue with it you will find that it doesn't live up to all of it's hype. Good thing they are starting the DVD series. Maybe that will do this great manga justice.
1,"Loved the manga, but VERY DISAPPOINTED with the movie","Hey. What can I say? It just plain [stinks]. First of all, I love the manga series to death. It was one of my favorites that I was really looking forward to the movie. But when I saw it, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Yes, it had a lot of action and blood and magic. I'm never queasy about any of those things. But it's also confusing, probably even more so if you have never even read the manga. You can't start to ""care for"" the characters because the chemistry just isn't there. I guess its one of those love it or hate em movies. But I hated it. And where's the plot? Sorry CLAMP, I love you girls, but this just plain BITES. Go watch Card Captor Sakura or something."
4,Interesting look at Good vs. Evil,"It's hard to imagine a modern-day Morality play explored in film - but that's what this movie does. Although the raw language may turn off some puritanical viewers, ignore it and concentrate on the story line. You'll be totally blown away by the final scene, I promise. Extremely fine acting overall, plus excellent direction and editing. Easy to see why it won an award for best director."
5,Track Listing,"Three Days Blind (4:34) - Larnelle Harris, Travis Cottrell, Michael O'Brien, First CallSoon (4:19) - Michael O'Brien, Larnelle HarrisGrace To You (4:24) - Corey EmersonAt The Name Of Jesus (3:30) - Travis CottrellLiving Sacrifices (3:40) - First CallYou Are Enough For Me (3:54) - Michael O'BrienDying Churches (4:11) - Travis CottrellThe Greatest of These (5:08) - Larnelle HarrisPressing On (3:46) - Michael O'BrienNothing Can Separate Us (4:42) - First Call"
5,"Rifftrax, nuff said. WORST best movie ever made!!!!","OK the title of my review says it all. It truly is the WORST movie ever made and the Rifftrax gang makes it even MORE funny than it was never intended (by the original Director, Writer, Producer, Cinematographer hmmm... did I leave anything out Mr. Ed. D. Wood Jr.). I highly recommend that anybody who needs an MSK3K style laugh pick up this movie and watch it but don't get too overly cerebral with it because these guys who did the original don't have two working brain cells to rub together if you know what I mean (as evidenced by the lead headlining dead guy Bela, again nuff said). In short BUY THIS Mike and the gang need the money.

5,Amazing,I loved seeing the local South Beach night scene. Irene Marie really knows how to pick em'! Great cast and great show!
5,great tv show,"Great t.v show. On the trailer it showed a lot of clips missing that weren't aired, where are they? how come the whole cast isn't on the cover? Vinci is awesome, just misunderstood i love his interviews, love brianna and tracie. adrien did he ever get that role?"
4,sweeping analysis of the possible futures of the universe,"excellent book which predicts the make up of the universe at future times beyond comprehension. Does an excellent job of explaining the physics is layman terms, but not too simply to be condescending. Black Holes as a computer is a very interesting concept."
5,Unequivocally Brilliant...,"A gorgeous read! Authors Adams and Laughlin inspire as they inform in this fascinating biography of the universe. While scientific material is presented accurately and thoroughly, the grandeur of the account is never diminished by the inclusion of unnecessary minutiae. Adams and Laughlin skillfully invite the reader to discover along with them new possibilities for the future universe. In doing, they fully engage the intellect and the imagination of the delighted reader."
5,One Of The Most Provocative Books Ever Written...,"This book is written for the layman and yet is ever so elegant.While much of it is still speculation and the result of current astrophysical theory, it is worth reading because it will take you to a ""what if"" universe that will blow your mind.It is a must read for anyone thinking about the big picture of the universe and what the future holds."
1,Missing Item -- no contact,"I'm sure this buyer has the potential to be great, but I notified him/her of the shipping mistake and I never heard from them. I never received the item, or a refund. I'm still looking for it actually..."
2,"Interesting concept, shaky mathematics","A very interesting narrative on the potential development and demise of our universe. The manuscript attempts to condense future time by introducing the concept of cosmological decades, i.e. time is transformed to a logarithmic scale.In doing so however, you can no longer claim that a billion years equals to 9 decades, that depends fully on WHEN these billion years happens. A second concern has to do with life expectancy: If a particle has a life expectancy of a million years and a pool of 1 million particles is available than it does not mean that every year a particle decays. In other words, the autors assume a uniform distribution where a normal distribution is more probable.Issues like the onces described caused me to abandon reading the book about half way. Despite the interesting concept I cannot recommend it."
5,All Songs!,"From Grandma's Heart is a true original. In addition to using the phone and email, my boys remain in warm touch with their grandmother by listening to the CD. They have maintained a wonderful connection!"
2,Definitely Had Potential!,"I rate this book 2 1/2 stars.The storyline is good, though it was greatly underdeveloped to make it an attractive read. The characters and how they relate and/or interact certainly had more potential, but it was unremarkably written.Getting to the root of the plot is rather exasperating and only moderately explained. Many times I was left wondering what one circumstance had to do with the other and the purpose of some characters. The writing style did not efficiently flow as I found myself having to re-read something to get the gist or understand the author's meaning.It definitely could have been a great book."
4,What fun Christmas dishes,"I love the pictures and verses on these plates. The Christmas Story is told complete on 16 plates - two verse lines on each plate. The colors are vivid and the pictures are absolutely delightful. These dishes are so much fun to use on Christmas day.I am not sure if they are hand painted or not. Also, not sure if they are safe to put in the dishwasher. This information would be helpful.The only reason I did not rate the plates 5 was because they do not stack evenly. The stack was rough looking - looked like inexpensive dinnerware stacked. Also, the trim painted on the edge of the plates was not always the same - some plates showed more white. A good quality set would have been the same on all plates. You would think a company planning a series of dinnerware would make sure the design was consistant.But, in spite of this I love the dishes and will be ordering completer pieces."
4,Endlessly engrossing,"I'm not a crime historian and can't comment on the quality of the scholarship, but the author supports the entries with many citations. The prose is readable, albeit in need of editing and marred with the typos and misprints one expects to afflict the first edition of such a large work. Truly encyclopedic, it covers everything from forgeries to defenestrations, and most pages are illustrated (with everything from woodcuts of 18th-century executions to headshots of criminals and victims famous and obscure). The author obviously loves the subject and has dug deep to fill this treasure-chest for the crime-obsessed mind."
5,Heavy Duty !,"Thick, rigid construction. Used for pouring waste oil into 55 gal. drum. It get's a lot of use and holds up well. I like the deep well, helps prevent spills."
4,"""Home Again"" is home comfort music.","""Home Again"" is second only to ""How Did You Find Me Here"". Here David continues his meaningful lyrics that tell great stories. In particular, ""Burgundy Heart"", ""Let Them In,"" and ""Covert War"" are wonderful songs that stick with you. Wilcox deviates slightly from his tried-and-true guitar on a few tracks, but the listener benefits from David's experimenting."
5,Excellent CD,"Excellent CD. Shows David's mellow voice and excellent guitar work. This CD is a dramatic change from his first work, Nightshift Watchman, with a new emphasis on open tunings that allow him to get great melodies from his guitar. If you like artists like James Taylor or the Indigo Girls, you will love this CD."
5,Totally rockin' garage rockabilly R&B one-man band,"The parlor trick of two-member garage-rock-blues bands (Flat Duo Jets, Mojo Nixon, White Stripes) is sawed in half by Mark Sultan's one-man-wonder. With the aid of foot pedals, Sultan strikes up rudimentary, yet surprisingly dance-worthy backbeats for his infectuous rhythm guitar playing. He's equal parts Pebbles garage rock (""Outta My Mind""), slap-echo rockabilly (""Burn This Town"" and a cover of The Stones' ""Out of Time"" filtered through ""Summertime Blues""), and R&B crooner (the Sam Cooke styled ""Don't You Hold Out on Me"" and ""Shake Real Low,"" and the barn-burning ""Waddlin' Around""). If these sides had been recorded in the late '50s, they would have no doubt served as inspiration for The Wailers and Kingsmen as they cut loose in the frats. Instead, they're delivered through a magical med-fi portal just in time for your summer cookout dance party."
5,nuclear assault is a great band,"nuclear assault is a great older band i don,t hear alot of them anymore . i like there music and hopefully others will as well.see were i live you can,t just go in a music store and buy there albums any more."
5,Nuclear Assault,"Everyone knows Nuclear Assault rules.Two Great albums on one cd.Game Over is Nuclear Assault's first album,Game Over has thirteen songs on the album.Starts off with Live,Suffer,Die.After The Holocaust is my favorite song on the album John Connelly's voice is awesome.Sin rules,Brain Death and all the songs are awesome.The Plague is there second album,that has six songs on it.Nightmares just rules,Game Over is from 1986 and The Plague is from 1987."
4,Warp keeps its street cred.,"This album blows my mind thinking about how much time it must have taken to program this music. This is certianly not a loop album. The track Kill Robok will make you go mad trying to keep up with it. The sounds are all over the place, you think you ears are going to start bleeding, it's freaking wonderful. The topper on this album is the very well done cover of the Joy Division classic, ""love will tear us apart"". They drop the sampler and pick up the guitar and bass and pay tribute to one of the greatest mellon-collie songs of all time.The only bad things I can say about this album is that it is a little on the short side but luckly, they include a bonus CD ""alive from japan"" to make up for that."
3,Good slightly outweighing bad,"This, on the studio EP, has a few hyper and cleverly drilled arrangements, recalling Square's most delightfully frantic early 2000 output. However, even on a brief seven tracks, and despite a bit of appreciated contrast (the serviceable Joy Division closer) Jenkinson simply flies off the electro rails too easily into masochistic, irrelevant button smashing without rightful payoffs. I think he is one of the few electronic artists who can convert noise into melody, but when he is being lazy he is only converting noise into noise."
4,Do You Know The Mental health Act (1956),"It could take a while (unlike the album itself), but there's plenty of good stuff here. It's not Donkey Rhubarb, and it's not Blue Monday, but what it is is original. It smells like a new car. The best tracks are the first and last of CD1. The inclusion of the Joy Division cover is a good thing, and it's warped and metallic and synaesthetic. TJ has made a good compact album here. It's like an exploding shed"
1,An overpriced maxi-single,"This ""album"" is 32 minutes long. That's half as long as most Autechre EPs. There's nothing new here...The music is unmistakably Squarepusher, and if you enjoy his style (I certainly do) you'll enjoy the little that his here.The ""Alive in Japan"" bonus CD (undoubtedly thrown in to justify the price) is surprisingly bad; the sound quality is mediocre and hearing Jenkinson yell, ""C'mon make some ... noise!!!"" gets old the second or third time around.Ever get the feeling you've been had?"
4,Would all the fake Squarepusher fans please stop listening?,"... This album is for people who have evolved with SP and like what he's become as well as allowing him space to continue experimenting - the thing we love him for most. This is probably not going to be known as his best album, but it still crushes all the competition."
2,I've heard better,"I've never actually listened to this, because I have a lot of Andrew Lloyd Webber CDs which I really like and listen to all the time."
3,Be prepared for disappointment.,"The Andromeda DVDs have been somewhat of a disappointment to me, this one, 1.4 more so then the other. The episodes themselves are in wonderful quality and are the main reason I bought the DVD.However the limited number of episodes on each disk is appalling. And the extras on it, doesn't even come close to making up for the lack of them. The bloopers were short, and were mostly of Kevin Sorbo. The behind the scenes of the alien makeup seemed promising, however was less then five minutes. And then there was the fact that I could never find the commentary for ""Fear & Loathing in the Milky Way.""So my advice to you is, if you are truly an Andromeda fan, then this is something for you. But be prepared for disappointment."
2,Not so good,"This show is a pale imitation of other sci fi shows. The episodes in this volume are probably some of the better ones. Of course, that's not saying much. It's a shame that this show continues while good sci fi shows,i.e. Farscape,are cancelled."
1,"Good action bad, bad acting!!","The characters are interesting and the action is fine, but the flow and the logic are entirely missing and the foreshadowing is straight from a poorly written and directed B-flick. The editing is also a major distraction. It is amazing how little spell and grammar checking goes on in all these e-books. Not just this book, but everyone lets just have a little pride and professionalism. SINCERELY!!!"
2,Role playing game?,"Reading a ""Prelude to a Warrior"" was like watching someone-else playing a computer game for hours on end. There isn't a story to follow (or not much of one), just a lot of fighting where only marginal characters get killed.Oh, Kael dies too, manny times, but miraculously comes back to life. Someone pressed a reset button? Things just happen for what seems to be no reason at all. Author sucks you in into a story by well defined characters and great premise, shows you glimpses of a secrets (powerful artefacts, importance of collecting demon's tusks) and then just forgets about the whole thing. It's just wasn't enough for me to get curious to read a next book.I will summarise in a words of Kael: ""It was so chaotic. There was no method - no reason at all to any of it""O yeah, he wants to clear the land of a demons for his people, but there is only him and his zombie girlfriend left. What?"
3,Needs grammatical help,"While the storyline appears to be adequate, the constant misuse of grammatical terms, ranging from improper verb tense to out-and-out wrong word (exhume instead of exude), are a definite problem with this work. I have not yet finished reading it, but plan to do so, even though the grammatical errors are very distracting. I hope that this author will invest in a proofreader next time!"
3,I don't like how he ends up with the daughter...,"I lurv cowboys! But this one got a little weird. First of all, the father's relationship with the lawyer was a clear ethical violation! Plus, I don't like how in the end, he leaves her for the daughter instead. If I would have known that, I would have gone with another Harlequin classic!"
5,Kudos,"I picked this book up in the library, intrigued by the cover, and discovered a beautifully written account of one American woman's unique experience among the Shiites in Iraq. Her story brought back so many memories of my six years living with my Shiite inlaws in Tehran during the sixties (Daughter of Jersalem). Although I did not have to wear a chador (except for religious holidays), I could easily relate to this story. I wanted to write to Elizabeth Fornea only to find out she died last year. As a writer of fiction(The Samson Option) and creative non-fiction, I have to take my hat off to Prof. Fornea. Her prose, style and humor are first class. Of course, as some critics claim, she did not dwell on the darker issues in this society. I also used restraint in telling my story (and I was deported without my sons!) But her depiction, of real women, living real lives is a classic."
1,A Poor Attempt,"What is this trend that we Americans seem to be following? We visit foreign country, meet the natives, learn very little about their culture and customs, and suddenly we are experts worthy of writing books on our experiences. This is the unfortunate case in this travesty. Elizabeth Warnock Fernea is the only person who could have celebrated Ramadan in Iraq without understanding the significance of the celebration. Her prose is boring, and every chapter is merely a very brief overview of the subject. I spent the entire book hoping the next chapter would be better than the one I was reading. It never was."
1,Author is an Air Head & anti-feminist!,"i HATE this author because her book only described women in their physical tersm. primarily, whether they were a 'dusky beauty' or otherwise, all women are 'plain' in her mind. She is not enlightened at all about the various challenges women face. she is only concerned with how well they cook, clean & please their husbands. she offered hardly any insight into shiite muslim woman's world. i'm disgusted to find out she is has received so much acclaim as a 'feminist', author & professor (her obsession with superficial design elements may allow her to make so-so films but she should not be a well-received author!). She's an air head. Read this book & you'll see exactly."
2,Home office purchase,I work from home and needed to replace my office chair - I ordered this one because it looked like it would help my back when I sat for long periods (and I don't like the arms on office chairs- they seem to get in the way of my typing) It was very simple to assemble- it only took about 5 minutes. The quality is not good...the back keeps coming loose and it doesn't really give me any support. I was dissapointed in my purchase. It's not much different than the $30 chairs you can purchase at Walmart...
1,UNWATCHABLE,"I've watched tons of reality fight dvd's and this is by far the worst. The footage is often too grainy, out of focus, or not on the action.""Hosted"" by two boring girls with the lamest dialogue ever drudged up.Save your money."
4,Nancy's boots do the talking,"Nancy was lucky to team up with Lee Hazelwood. He was the musical genius. She was the pretty singer. The tough as nails daddy's girl act was a bit silly, but who really cares, together they belted out some really memorable hits that have become part of any space capsule of that time."
5,A Must See!!!!!,"I saw this when I was in college on a film projector and the film blew me away. It was in black and white and it was very informative and educational. I begged my professor to get me a copy of this and she did. She put it on a VHS tape that I had for years that I showed to company for many years. The tape was 'lost, stolen or strayed'...and I periodically looked for it online and when I saw this I INSTANTLY purchased it. I received it THE NEXT DAY and watched it with my wife. It's one of those documentaries that you never forget. Bill Cosby handled this subject like a thoroughbred. And to my surprise, the DVD version of this is in COLOR!!! Amazingly clear, and there's only one word for the message and how it was presented: POWERFUL!!"
2,A Big Letdown,"The debut Blues Traveler CD was truly fascinating. Great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as Gina, But Anyway, Warmer Days, and Sweet Talkin' Hippie.This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes. As talented as the instrumentalists might be, after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present. All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody. Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest, Greg Allman. In time I could appreciate it a bit more. Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic.However, the overall impression is that of boredom. The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality. Even Popper's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD.The discriminating fan will choose the first CD, Four, and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess."
1,Save your money,"While I love Four, this CD is terrible. It sounds like a different (dare I say terrible) band. Save your money, and your ears."
4,A cool CD from a cooler band,"This is a great CD. It's got John Popper's great harmonica, and the rest of the band as well. But those who are into the band because of songs like 'Run-Around' and 'Hook' should beware, this is not the Blues Traveler you know. It's better."
3,The Good Times Are Killing Me,"If you want a (slightly abridged) copy of Lynda Barry's play 'The Good Times Are Killing Me', this book has it, along with a review of the play and photos of scenes from the off-broadway production.However, if you want the full version of the play, you will need to purchase 'The Good Times are Killing Me', published by Samuel French."
4,Historic Adventure,"The author knows his history and tells a good story around it. This is a must read for all who want western adventure, and it is a perfect choice for black history month. Good characterization, thrilling action and surperb accuracy in the details of the period."
1,Saddened,"I thought this book was extremely demeaning to both African Americans and Native Americans. I do not think that it accurately captured the attitudes of the black soldiers who were confronting all levels of racism from their white superiors. Nor did the black protagonist ever stand up to or confront a white over the issue of racism. He was happy in his subservient role. He wasn't offended when whites called him nigger. The Native Americans were basically portrayed as savages who without provocation attacked innocent whites. There was never any mention of their inherent rights as the first settlers of America, nor any significant recognition of the injustices they suffered as a people.This portrayal of life on the frontier is basically a myth which should have died before it was spawned."
4,Neo-Synephrine Mild Formula,"I was looking for a milder product that wouldn't burn my 7 year old's nose, but would help him breathe better at night. Neosynephrine Mild Formula works great. It was recommended by a friend and I was unable to find it in stores. It only lasts about 4 hours, though. Overall, I am pleased with this product."
4,"Great Pans, GREAT value!",these are great pans! the cheesecake just pops right out of them when you are ready for it too. and they are much less expensive than wilton pans.
3,"Half good , Half bad?","I was disappointed by the sound/recording flaws onfive tracks, rather, I was surprised. The liner notesand pics are excellent!! There does need to be a boxset with ALL the contents of lps Fancy, Patchwork, andthe ones missed off of the Delta Sweete, and Local Gentry.The most disappointing was ""Another Place, Another Time"",the sound quality is very Poor, and cheats the listenerof the whole song. I'm grateful for the effort put forthin getting a compilation of her songs out, but there needs'to be control in the QUALITY of SOUND. Gentryman1967"
3,Still Waiting,"While it is great to have selections from the Delta Sweete, Local Gentry, and Patchwork albums, I was dissapointed that Gentry gems such as But, I Can't Get Back, Belinda, Seasons Come, Seasons Go, and some of the excellent covers from the Touch 'Em With Love and Fancy albums were not included. Especially disapointing is Another Place, Another Time. The quality is poor and it fades out at the beginning of the third verse. And so this Bobbie Gentry fan is still waiting for a definitive Bobbie Gentry CD. Why no box set for this artist? Bobbie, are you out there?"
3,Military story telling to package Tracy's core,"We mankind learn from story. If you are a military story fan, this book might worth a causal read. However, I doubt the stories really add value to Tracy's long time (and repetitive) core content. For it is just another compilation.And there's argument on the word ""Proven"". Ch.3 talks about the principle of the mass, ""proved"" by the battles such as Isandhlwana, Austerlitz, .... However in Ch. 9, the battle of Chancellorsville counter-prove that principle! So just take the word as a marketing buzz."
5,ANOTHER COMPILATION MASTERPIECE,"Brian is the best compiler ever. As Aristotle said, ""There is nothing new under the sun."" You may not find any new idea or concept, but if you follow the strategies mentioned in the book, you will become simply unstoppable. It's an invaluable book that should be in the bookcase of everyone who takes the challenge of succeed in life seriously and wants to do something extraordinary with their lives. Another great compilation by Mr. Tracy.Luiz C. Carvalho"
5,Highly Recommended!,"Although it's an overused metaphor, top business speakers and best-selling author Brian Tracy show how you can apply battle-proven methods to achieving victory in the world of business. While many of the principles sound familiar, Tracy's presentation is lively and well organized. He covers the importance of having objectives, getting the facts, coordinating your activities, daring to go forward, concentrating your forces, conserving your resources and having one person in charge. He uses battlefield illustrations to remind us of these principles. He also draws on ancient and modern historical accounts of battles to illustrate the close connection between victory in war and in business. If your approach to business hinges on careful strategy and targeted planning, we think you will find tactical weapons in this military manual that you can muster in the fields of commerce."
2,Not much to recommend in it.,"A book with filmreviews like Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide but here are, of course, just horrorfilms mentioned. There is also information about actors and directors. The strange thing with this book is why Maxford wrote it; he doesn't seem to like many of the films in the horror genre. It's only the mainstream stuff, like Silence of the Lambs and such films, that get positive reviews. And don't expect to learn something when you read the directors/actors entries; Just some information where and when they where born plus a listing of (genre)films they have made. The reviews are rather boring to read, you get the feeling that Maxford was ashamed when he wrote this book cause of the subject matter. If you are a fan of horrorfilms and want a film guide I would recommend John McCarty's Official Splatter Movie Guide part 1 & 2 and John Stanley's Creature Features insted."
1,It's just a huge list of horror movies.,I expected some insight to the great horror movies but it is just a huge list of every horror movie in existence. It is more for research than entertainment or education.
4,Beautiful score; almost as good as the original release!,"Some of John Williams' best work, including the fabulous ""Losing E.T."" which Spielberg apparently edited around Williams' music!This second release, however, is not as ""concertized"" as the initial and, as a CD, tends to ramble a bit more. It is even missing one of the best tracks from the original, ""E.T. and Me;"" I often wish I had my original LP with me just so I could go back and hear it again.Still, it is beautiful music and well worth its place in anyone's soundtrack collection."
3,Happy Oooops,"I meant to buy the movie and bought this in error. However, as a fan, I listened to it and liked it. I will keep it in my car instead of in my DVD collection."
3,ET Soundtrack,This is only the soundtrack not the movie. Did not state that it did not include the movie. Had to purchase the movie at Blockbuster for $12.88.
4,E.T.,"John Williams outdoes himself with this fabulous music. Sadly, this CD does not feature Over The Moon, one of my favorites, but luckily it is featured in the Credits. Flying is celestial and it is really a feather in Williams hat. This music sends shivers up one's back. Far from Home has a profondissimo basso organ that ""really scares children."" And Adventures on Earth (17) is exciting aural emotion. Any fan of John's has to have this score."
5,Exceptional Cd of ET selections,I heard selections of the ET Soundtrack played by the local Philharmonic. I was so impressed that I ordered this CD. The CD by John Williams lives up to the music selections I heard by my local Philharmonic. this is an exceptional musical CD.
3,For those who're fond of M.C.Beaton . . .,"For those who're caught up on your M.C. Beatons . . ., a choice alternative for you is Hildegarde Withers. This deliciously feisty character is a schoolmarm detective, who solves her cases with astuteness and chalkboard determination. Of course, you'll be trading in Scotland for New York CIty, and half-baked crimes for well-planned ones, but is that such a terrible loss. Additionally, since the action takes places in the early 1930s, there are derbys, pay telephones, and hard-talking, bumbling coppers. On top of that, Stuart Palmer supplies a whole lot of humaneness. For example, Withers' monologue on justice and the unstereotyped depiction of her integrated class. In the end, here's a quick, entertaining read."
3,too long,i think the sizing was just a bit misleading. the pants we a tad too long for an extra large.
2,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!,"Don't get me wrong, I was tickled pink when I saw this LP was up for download. I owned the cassette of this until I wore it out years ago. It is a great ground breaking masterpiece that invented the death punk movement. It deserves at least 4 stars, so why only 2? The song files are corupted. The ENTIRE album is full of pops and clicks and wavy feedback and is un-listenable. Amazon was nice enough to let me try the download again, but the files are bad. This item needs to be taken off the Accused album list. It's sad, cos this is a hard to find great album."
3,Confusing,"The problems are based on misunderstanding Father, Son and the Holy Spirit on the basis of male identity and behaviour and not seeing them as cosmic energies (positive, negative and neutralizing).I agree that this narrow view of Christianity has been leading many astray. Therefore it is important to stop it!To explain the feminine Sophia and the Wisdom that she represents from the standpoint of a reaction to the male dominance through the Christian time of the past two thousand years is bound to end up in verbal definitions, which are far removed from the reality of this passive cosmic force.[I do not know if the original German version uses the word 'orthodox' to describe 'usual' and general attitudes about Christianity, but in English it is disturbing (although the writer when she writes about Orthodox uses a big O).]"
2,Shipped wrong item,"I ordered replacement beams for my cat furniture (they don't last long with my cats). Unfortunately Feline Furniture sent the wrong items. I know they will send me the right items if I return the items they sent, but it's still a hassle that I shouldn't have to go through."
3,I don't care for Snoddy's conclusions but I enjoyed reading about him.,Enjoyed doing research into Snoddy. Sorry he believed what he did believe. Too bad A.W. Fortune believed the same. They have done much hurt to the Restoration Movement.
1,A timid tome from a timid traveller,"As a simple account of one man's voyages, this is barely acceptable. On the other hand, great disappointment awaits those who, like me, bought this book in anticipation of an in-depth insight into travel on cargo ships. McCamish writes badly, and is seemingly concerned more with destinations than getting there. Even then, he resorts frequently to quoting the descriptions, often archaic, that others have written about various ports. He is overly concerned to the point of immaturity with a romanticised notions of barnacle-encrusted sailors brawling in bars where scared civillians like he fear to tread, and other cliches attached to men of the sea, and is then disappointed when he can't find them.Throughout the reading of this I hoped he'd stop his moaning and nervous uncertainty, get on a plane, and go home.It's the worst book I've struggled through in a long time. And I learnt next to nothing about travel on cargo ships."
5,A wonderful journey,"Thornton McCamish's journey among ports is a wonderful, witty and whimsical work - the perfect holiday read. McCamish has a gentle and very funny writing style - completely engaging. His observations are sharp and his journey compelling. When do we get a second book Mr McCamish?"
5,old death,i know this review is nothing new to anyone rerading this but this album is a great heavy album containing awsome fast solos awsome vocals a deffinate buy. but what this review is really about is that faggot who sayss it sucks if he is serious he should die in hell and be sen to the first plain of hell and be forever stung by wasps and demons breathe go listein to slipknot atreyu and all youre othe homoerotic bands you little poser
5,A Classic,"I've been wanting this album since I discovered Death Metal as a young teen. Listening to it on the internet just wasn't enough, I had to own this. If you're looking to get into the roots of Death Metal then this album is definitely recommended. You'll love every minute of it right down to the note. Pick it up!"
5,One of the Best Ever !!!!!!,This album is amazing. It came out when I was a senior in high school back in 1988-89. It left my jaw hitting the floor and it still does to this day. The songs are all memorable and catchy with great riffs and killer leads from both Chuck and whammy bar master Rick. If you don't own this album you must buy it. You will not be disappointed. Death was and is one of the greatest death metal bands of all times. Chuck you are missed. You were an inspiration to all of us. LONG LIVE DEATH !!!!!!
3,gift with cracked case,I bought this cd as a gift from my daughter to give to her boyfriend. The cd itself was fine however the case had a big crack in it. Her boyfriend loved the cd and had no issues with it but it was quite embarrassing for her to give him a gift with a cracked case.
5,Classic,"This album was a trend setter. Death's most brutal and best album. Pull the Plug is one of the most classic tunes in this genres history. Why are you still reading, buy this already."
1,"Noise, nosie and more noise","How can anyone like this pi$$ poor band/style of music? i got this album from a freind and it only took me one listen to give it back. Death Metal? c'mon, this crap is music that posuers listen too to try to be scary and tough. If your gonna listen to metal, at least do yourself a favor and listen to real metal like like Black Sabbath, Preist, Saxon, Accept, Helloween, Venom, Bathory, Slayer,Megadeth,Testament or what ever, bands where actual thought is put into the song writting and arrangments, something these retards from Florida apparently have no knowlege of. If playing the same three chords repeatadly as fast as you can and banal unintelligable grunting from some 3rd grade level dropout is considered talent these days, well, metal is screwed. avoid this band like the plauge."
2,Not Complete Without The Uni Mono Singles,"The Neil Diamond completists, the ones who buy these repackagings, are seeking the original mono mixes of the Uni singles, especially Sweet Caroline. These significantly different mixes, in my opinion, were superior to the stereo album versions and are the original sounds emanating from the transistor radio which hit our ears and propelled Neil into superstardom. Mr. Diamond, or whoever possesses these mono mix masters, please put them out. Why not make some money before the fan-base dies out? No Uni collection is complete without the mono singles, so 2 stars for you. Next?"
4,Inconsistent ND,"Wow there are some great songs here -- Sunday Sun, Sweet Caroline - and some HORRIBLE songs -- Pot Smoker's Song? Horseflies? - just terrible! Some of these songs contain the WORST lyrics ever recorded. Gitchy Goomy, Crunchy Granola Suite, Porcupine Pie (are you kidding me??), Captain Sunshine, I Am I Said... sound like lyrics written by a 2nd grader just to get a rhyme - ""No one heard me at all not even the chair???"" Terrible lyrics ruin terrific tunes. It's a real shame Neil didn't have the sense to hire a good lyricist -- it would have made most of these songs so much better! All in all very inconsistent like all of Neil's albums. Its a shame because most of these albums had 90-95% great tunes but with only 1 or 2 songs with even decent lyrics. Agree they should have put 2 albums per CD which would have made for a smoother listen. Only consisent album he made during this period was Moods which is terrific."
3,play me,"Take a close look at the specific titles,many of his newer stuff is not there or is done in a not so good live version. Lots of little known tunes,was a little disapointed,i thought i had all his good stuff."
4,Terrific performance & good sound,"This recording was made in 1936. Despite that early date, the sound is quite acceptable -- very little background noise, and a nice clear strong signal. Even very quiet passages are easy to make out. But even more than the surprising sound quality is the performance -- flowing, lyrical & dramatic! Karl Bohm is an excellent Bruckner conductor & this is a fine example of what he could do. Recommended!"
3,BLADE IS TOO SOFT,"YES, IT LOOKS PRETTY, BUT THE BLADE IS MADE OF A SOFTER STEEL THEN BUCK USES ON IT'S REGULAR KNIVES. AND YES IT'S EASY TO SHARPEN, BUT IT ALSO DULLS QUICKLY."
5,"Big, beautiful, and inspiring","I am lucky to have one of the initial copies of this journal and I am so impressed I wanted to write a review. This is a real gem, not only because of the wonderful content, but because of the beauty in the book itself. We always say not to judge a book by it's cover, but I think the cover is one of my favorite parts! It is hardcover. It will last on my bookshelf for many years. Inside, the reader is guided through hands-on exercises that help prepare for birth and parenting, as well as space to record memorable events through the first year. It truly is a keepsake. I highly recommend it for expecting couples."
5,Missle to the Moon and fearsome dangers of Rock monsters.,Being a long time Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan RiffTrax was just a natural love. This film has more cheese on it than a pizza topping. From rubber suited Rock monsters of the movement speed of curdled milk to unitard wearing bathing competitors the moon is a bit odd. The idea of using two teenage car thieves as shrewd and smart ship's crew I had the best round of chuckles again as always with Rifftrax. Such a stinker needs a good razzing.
4,college,Good book. Almost too much information. Can be confusing if your just searching for a college without prior direction
5,Intriguing - A Meteor Is Timeless,"""Meteor"" by Karel Capek is a novel having a story within another story that tells of the process of writing the novel itself."
3,bad boys 2 is good,"most of the cd has p.diddyand feat biggie,loon,snoop,Beyonce,dre,nelly,Jay-Z,Murphy Lee,Pharrell Williams,Fat Joe,50 Cent,Mario Winans,Foxy Brown,Justin Timberlake,Mary J. Blige and Da Band.buy the album"
4,DIDDY STRIKES BACK,"Diddy knows how to get the tightest MC's all in one CD. He got it from Jigga to Nelly and also his new group from 'MTV's Making The Band.' His crew came up and he still won't stop DAMMM!!. The traxs on this CD are cool but some are not impressive. Some songs could have used a little touch ups but still sound good. The hot trak by Jay-Z ""La La La"" is blazin', Neptunes keep knockin at the streets.Yaoh Ming. And the other track I recommend is Da Band's track ""WHY"", that song is real tight, they came up in the game for real Diddy know what he got and put his mind to it. But all that talkin' at the end of the track needs to be KUTTT!!! But yeah this CD is pretty sick, it's worth buying on the real. HOLLA!!!"
3,It's OK I guess,"I really love the Murphy lee, Nelly, P. Diddy song, and that is why I bought this CD. There is maybe one or two other good songs. But not worth buying the whole CD."
4,...not bad diddy!!!,"i don't know about it bein the best soundtrack ever as stated by diddy, but his bad boy 2 soundtrack. has some tight songs from a pretty well assembled all star cast of artists. the big stars held it down.....nelly, 50 cent, snoop & hova. but it was quite refreshing to see diddy's nex generation shine a bit. loon held his own alongside snoop on ""gangsta .... as 4 da band (diddy, that is a dumb name 4 the band by the way}, their ""why"" joint was really tight. if they can actually start getting along, they might not have a bad short lived career. hahaha!"
4,"Good, but not quite five stars!!!","I really enjoy this CD because several big name artists are on it. My favorite song is definetly number four, I love Nelly and P. Diddy. But hey, Justin Timberlake is great!! This will appeal to people who like different genres of music."
5,bad boys rule,These guys are the best singers that i have heard. They are very good together. I'm glad thet they picked these people to do this soundtrack. And the movie looks really good too.
4,Bad Boys for life,"This is one of the coolest soundtrack albums of 2003. With super producers like P. Diddy and Neptunes this album is absolutely slamming. With guest artistes like Jay-Z, Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, 50 Cent, Mario Winans, P. Diddy, Pharell, Foxy Brown, and so on, the albums contains loads of danceable tunes and I recommend it for all."
1,c'mon puff!,"You have got to be kidding me. P. Diddy is trying to put Bad-Boy back on the map and he comes up with this ?! Except for Jay-Z's ""La, La, La"" (which has already been played to death on the airwaves) there is not one single song on this album that stands out. The beats are all substandard, the vocals are weak and the production is downright poor. And why does Puff feel compelled to make a bad song worse by putting his misplaced interjections on practically every song (bad boy, yeah!)?Personally, I'd pass on this one and go pop Biggie's ""Ready to Die"" in my CD player and yearn for the ""good days"" of ""Bad Boy"""
1,VERY OVER RATED SOUNDTRACK.,"This cd is just another ploy by poop diddy to make more money.Believe me,its not worth your hard earned money.The album has no consistency and theres probably only 2 songs worth listening to.This cd just has alot of hype around it and thats it.Download the songs you like off the computer.DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!"
3,alright i guess,"this is sort of good but a lot of songs aren't that great. there's also lots of boring interludes from the movie. i think the only one needed was the intro because its hilarious.the real good songs are""Realest n****s"" by 50 and Biggie (best)""La-La-La"" by Jay-Z""Shake Ya Tailfeather"" by Nelly, murphy lee and diddy (but is old)""Flipside"" by Freeway and Peddi crackand ""Show Me Your Soul"" by diddy, lenny kravitz, pharrell, and loon.so if u LOVE diddy and bad boy go get it. if not, listen 2 tha clips."
5,sick sick sick!,"I adore this film, I adored the music even more. The one missing song in this soundtrack was ""Atrevido"" by Orishas, the song that's played when Syd and Tapia are at the beach for a meeting."
5,Greatest Soundtrack Ever - Nice Job Diddy,"This CD features so many good artists and all with new songs! This isn't a compilation CD, its a brand new CD that you can keep in your CD player on repeat. Ranging from Nelly to Fat Joe, Biggie to Justin Timberlake, Mario Winans to Loon, Foxy to Diddy... Its all good!! Be sure to support the artist and buy the CD's, dont download mp3s and share music files. It worked out perfectly having the first release on the ""New Bad Boy Records"" - as Bad Boys II."
1,DREDFUL!!!,This is the worst soundtrack i ever heard (and the most overrated one too)i only liked 2 or 3 songs and thats it the rest were garbage!!!by the way listen to the songs on YouTube before you even think about buying this lame cd!!!
3,"Big names, decent songs, but not spectacular","I'm a pretty big rap fan, and was excited to pick up a copy of this CD based on some of the big names on it like Dre, Snoop, 50 cent, nelly, p diddy, etc. It's got several really nice, catchy songs on it and the Snoop song is pretty sweet. Overall though, it could have been better. I'd say there's probably 5 good songs, but other than that the rest are kind of lacking. So, I'd say this CD from a rap standpoint is average, but nothing more than that."
2,...what is it,"This cd was terrible. With rappers who are in it for the money that no true rap respecting fan would dream of appreciating include pdiddy...sweet name....nelly, and loon are at their worst. all 3 of these rappers have no talent. I can't believe someone callisifies the tracks on this cd as rap or even hip hop"
1,"Are you a rap poser? If so, then this is for you.","I am getting so sick of every single artist on this album. This is nothing more than a showcase for various artists to use throwaway tracks as cash cows.With this album, the studio bigwigs have taken some of the most annoying and fake rappers currently on the scene and have marketed them to idiot kids who buy this stuff and think it's cool. This isn't even music. This is corporate greed at it's worst."
4,2 SONGS WERE THE BEST ON THIS SOUNDTRACK,2 SONGS WERE THE BEST1st song that I loved off this soundtrack...Didn't Mean ..By Mary J Blige... This song is HOT.. I hoped that this song was on Love And Life .. Her voice on this soundtrack brings a maturity and completeness to a RAP SOUNDTRACK..The Scatting Mary is doing is as good as Ella's.. I was blown away.. Mary is the Best ..2nd song is Realest Ni**as.. By Notorious BIG and 50 Cent..Biggie has been gone about 7 years now .. and his verses .. still killed it.. 50 is here and now and still couldn't ride that track better than Biggie..Puffy P Diddy Combs picked 2 champions ( Mary J and Biggie ) early in his career..Everything else on this soundtrack is O.K. .. even Jay Z and Pharell were average...
3,Three stars for the three tolerable tracks!,"I know that'll incur the wrath of the devoted, but this album is not pleasing to my ears. I realize that it's due to my disdain for most music of the rap nature. I try to focus on the lyrics but the constant barrage of expletives just doesn't cut it with me.With the exception of less-than-memorable but adequate offerings from Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, and Mary J. Blige, the rest of the CD is just unbearable for me.Thus, I concede that its the difference in taste that I must give the album a 1-star rating; however, I know that those with a passion for rap will probably give it ""5"".With that in mind, the disc evens out with a three-star recommendation."
4,Full of Great Dance Songs!!!,"I really like the Bad Boys II Soundtrack! P. Diddy has really done a great job by compiling music from some of the best and hottest R&B; and hip-hop artists out there! Just about every song will have you on your feet and dancing!Stand-out tracks:Show Me Your Soul - P. Diddy, Loon, Pharrell Williams, and Lenny KravitzLa, La, La - Jay-ZShake Ya Tailfeather - P. Diddy, Nelly, and Murphy LeeLove Don't Love Me - Justin TimberlakeI would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to some great R&B;/Hip-hop music. Also, fans of MTV's ""Making the Band"" will be happy to hear the song ""Why"" from the group on that show, ""Tha Band"". This is one soundtrack you'll want to have this summer!"
1,Marketing Ploy,"This soundtrack is all hype and big names and what is sad is that this is the type of crap other youth are listening to thinking this is what music is all about. There is nothing wrong with hip-hop, but this is a clear sign the whole genre has lost any and all substance. My last fresh hope is Talib Kwali."
3,Three and a half...,"It is a pretty good soundtrack and it serves its purpose, but it doesn't have much replay value. The beat from ""La La La"" is great, but Jay-Z's lyrics aren't as good as he seems to think. The Notorious BIG song is phenomenal and it's amazing that P. Diddy held onto those great verses for so long, I just wish 50 Cent's wack verse was left out. This could have used more of the interludes from the movie, but I liked the idea to have them anyway. It's not mind expanding, but it's good enough to listen to 5 times or so."
4,Good Summer CD,"Most of the tunes are catchy; my favorites are ""Shake Ya Tailfeather,"" ""I Love You,"" and ""Keep Giving Your Love to Me."" Some of the collaborations are interesting, such as Lenny Kravitz with the P.Diddy and his gang on the first track. This is a very pop-oriented hip-pop album that aims toward the younger audience (note the inclusion of the hottest names in R&B and rap). It's not an innovative sound, but it is the first soundtrack produced by Bad Boys. Anyway, you either like it or you don't."
2,Why the hell....,"isn't the Orishas track ""Atrevido"" on there? they use the song like twice in the movie and dammit, they need need to rep my peoples on this. if you want to hear some really cool, unique, cuban rap try grabbing some Orishas tracks...they have two albums out right now and both are pretty hot. one"
1,Doesn't work in iBook 1.33 gHz laptop,It just causes the OS to produce install errors when attempting to install from a CD. Only use Memory from Apple for this particular computer's processor.
1,Not happy with the transaction,"ordered the memory and recieved it.it didn't work in my dell laptop, so Ireturned the item. about (5)days later they email me back saying the memory pass there test and I would be charged a re-stocking fee.I asked if there were any known problems with there product an dell laptops.no answer. not happy! I paid for them to ship to me, and paid for the return shipment,plus 20 percent re-stock. a lose lose transaction.will never do anything with this company again..."
2,There are many excellent first and second hand accounts of,"the horrors of the Nazis. This is not one of them. The recommendations from other authors (on the book sleeve) seem like professional quid pro quo, as the same authors are given as references inside. The book fails for several reasons. First the author lacks the in depth knowledge of her subject matter, and is frank about that. The interviews all take place decades after the events, they lack the kinds of vivid details that make other books great. The biggest problem with the book is that it reads more like a fictional account. The witnesses present us with unverified first hand accounts. They are free to withhold more revealing details, or to embellish their accounts. Several of the accounts just don't ring true, and one gets the impression that a story is being told. The author lacked the resources/ incentive to provide a more researched book. It may be entertaining, but it seems more like a work of fiction."
5,Excellent look at a little examined perspective.,"This book gives quite a unique persepective, of a variety of german women. If you are interested in WWII history, I would highly recommend."
3,interested reader,"Owing's book is good but could be improved. For one, she focuses too much attention on the Jewish question. I think she should have asked questions about certain subjects, such as family/marriage incentives, Nazi propaganda to raise the birthrate and female employment patterns. The author failed to get these questions answered when she had the chance."
5,A Compelling Book That Stayed With Me,"I initially checked this book out at my library and eventually bought it to have in my own collection of history books, it was that good.This book gives intense insight into what really happened to everyday women in Nazi Germany. Each of their stories had me spellbound; I was very moved by what they had to endure. As I read each woman's story, I felt as if I was going through their hardships with them. This book stayed with me long after I finished it and I still think about those women and I wonder if I would be able to have the physical and mental fortitude it took to survive those horrible years.Alison Owings has brought history to life in the narratives of these women.This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it!"
1,The Worst work on Howard Ever Done,"Sprague de Camp -- and I knew this guy for many years -- was the ultimate opportunist. Oscar Friend -- the original agent for REH's works after his death -- made the mistake of letting him in on Conan and over the decades -- from the 1950's through the 1980's -- made a pretty good living off Howard's cold dead body. This ""bio"" makes his one on Lovecraft seem fair and accurate. Nope, not at all. De Camp had the really annoying habit of trying to psychioanalyize other -- always dead -- writers. With this one he brought in his wife and some child psychatrist. The result is a really bad look at Howard from a guy --who despite the fortune he made off of him -- who deep down didn't like Howard or perhaps resented the fact that dead, Howard was still more popular than he could ever be. There are better works out there. Try them first."
4,A valuable read,"de Camp is always catching hell about something he wrote especially about REH and HPL. Dark Valley is highly readable. The text contains facts. de Camp does make judgments about his subject. This day in age we're trained not to judge anyone, so the book is refreshing. de Camp does succeed were many biographies fail and that is he makes the reader sympathetic about REH. REH is not just the subject about you can appreciate his life's difficulties. Any the book is highly readable. But I must add I'm biased toward de Camp . . . I've got an autographed copy."
5,One of the most MEANINGFUL books i've ever read,"Not Wanted on the Voyage was part of my fried's English Lit. OAC Class at school last year (the teacher was big on Canadian Literature...) and she recommended it to me. I loved it. Findley is an absolutely beautiful writer, and this novel is no exception. The character development is very well done; the characters themselves, and thus the ways we perceive them, change completely through the story, and the reader becomes quite involved in their lives. The story itself may be offensive to a christian reader, but only if he/she misses the point: Findley is commenting on the sad abuse of power, and not on christianity itself. Not Wanted on the Voyage is an incredible book, and i'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in a beautiful story with an interesting twist."
5,Never had a battery issue,"When purchasing the thermometer I was a bit taken aback by the many reviews complaining about lousy battery life on the remote sensing unit. Given it's low price and the fact that I could return it should it disappoint in that regard, I decided to take a risk and order the unit.I was pleasantly surprised, as we're now well within the 3rd month and still on the first battery set. Not only that, but the battery indicator still shows full.Temperature readouts are large enough to be seen from a few feet away, and it's small an unobtrusive overall."
1,Don't bother,"I have had this for several months. the inside unit has needed new batteries probably 4 or 5 times, but the remote unit had not needed replacements til now. I just replaced them and now the display won't pick up the outside temp. Was trying to find some instructions and stumbled upon these reviews so thought i'd add my own."
3,Simulated decimals,"I did not encounter any problem with the battery lifeunlike the other customers -- my unit run for a yearon the same set of batteries.On the other hand, the digit after the decimal pointis completely bogus -- it always goes through thesame sequence over and over again (and if you resetthe unit it will always start from the same digit)This is not a defect, but a deliberate design feature-- the signal from the remote is an integer witha resolution of one degree.This thermometer can be used as a material for a DIY projectto connect the receiver to a computer and automaticallyrecord readings from a several remote units."
1,Just plain junk,A year and one half ago I bought one of these thermometers. About 2 months ago it started eating batteries (just as in the other reviews) every week. I went to the store to replace the unit but could only get the same unit. So (dumb me) I bought the same unit. The batteries only lasted a week and they were gone. Please don't buy this and be disappointed.
1,disappointed,"The thermometer seems to have a very finite life--once the batteries are dead, it won't reset with new ones! Interesting way to get people to have to buy another one--but I won't be buying that brand again! I did read the comments about battery life, and like others, wasn't sure if they were old batteries, too cold, etc. In my case, the batteries did last a long time, but once they went dead it will not start with new ones. Clearly there is something wrong with this thermometer in relation to the batteries. I would prefer to give this product no stars, but it won't allow me to submit without at least one..."
2,cheap but basic,"I was hoping to find a wireless thermometer that would be compatible with my existing network and this isn't it.For a single-temperature reading from a single source, it's okay... but only barely. There is no feature other than the remote temperature (read: no time, humidity or other readings) but for that, it works. Be warned that it doesn't work with other brands or type of sending units (like Radio Shack, Oregon Scientific, Texas Instruments, etc)."
3,"One works great, the other was worthless",Quality control plagues this product. I've purchased two. One required new batteries every week and had to be consigned to the trash (one star!). The other has been running continuously in grueling heat and freezing cold for over a year without a battery change (five stars!).
1,Died but replaced. Replacement died.,"I had this unit for about 9 months when the display on the inside died. I couldn't find the receipt, but sent it back to the manufacturer anyway for a warranty replacement, which I received a few weeks later. I never encountered the battery problem reported by others. The unit work well.1/2/13 update: This replacement unit died when I replaced the batteries. Why that would happen I have no idea. Reducing rating to 1-star."
2,not accurate,"I've had this exact Acu-Rite unit for a few years now. It has a wireless outside sensor. I didn't really have a problem with battery life as some others have complained but after having it for a few years I've noticed that both the inside and outside temperature readings are no longer accurate. Inside reads 2 degrees higher than separate indoor thermometer I have to check it against and the outside temp reads as much as 10 degrees too high when compared to local weather report or mercury thermometer I have. No fix even after new batteries and selecting the ""reset"" button for both the outdoor sensor and inside reading unit. But is was fairly accurate for a couple of years. I wouldn't buy it again as I'm online searching for a replacement."
1,battery hog,"Same as other reviewers. Just bought 5/2011. Outside unit on 3rd set of Eveready Alkaline batteries. Too expensive to operate, so useless. Instructions say ""do not return to retailer - call us"", but they have no solution."
1,Display,I was under the impression that the display would provide a choice of F or C but only has F.
2,"Low end unit, battery issue","Worked fine for months, both inside and out. Then I replaced the batteries and NEVER got it to work correctly after that."
5,glad to find another one,I used one of these in my camper to keep track of the refrigerator temperature while traveling and had the receiver unit up in the truck with me and it always kept me informed of the fridge temp.... when not traveling i used it at the house to keep track of outside temperature which was three rooms away for the transmitter and it always worked fine.... I have since sold the camper and let the new owner have my wireless thermometer as i thought it was real handy. I missed it so bad i bought another.
4,no major battery problem,"I also bought this elsewhere and have had it about 8-9 months. Today the outdoor battery finally went bad. The indoor unit with display still works showing ""--"" for the outdoor temp. Not sure how they communicate, maybe it has to do with the distance between them, as reviews are mixed."
2,Decent with rechargable batteries,"Yes, it chews through batteries, mostly on the outdoor sensor. I got it at the hardware store. I used rechargable AAAs and that helped some. I had two sets so I could switch quickly. After using it for a couple of years the outdoor sensor died, although the indoor one still works. I do think both were accurate and I was satisfied with the actual temperature measuring of the thermometer. Basically don't waste your money."
1,How about <1 star?,Save your dollars and buy a better one. I didn't buy it from Amazon which is a lesson in itself. I spent too much time trying to make this piece of junk work. Forget about it!
1,Lousy unit,I did not buy this unit from Amazon.It eats batteries at an ASTONISHING rate to the point of being basicaly useless.I returned it and was told it was defective. The new unit was equally as bad.The manufacturer will not return calls.This is a CLASSIC case of getting what you pay for. Step up and buy a good one
1,Was curious how long batteries would last,"I bought this at a local store for about 10 bucks a little over a week ago. Was Googling on this unit to find out about battery life and there was a linky to Amazon. I noticed the battery comments and thought to myself well the outside unit has been running on the same batteries for 10 days. So maybe it was just a bunch of older units with battery issues. An hour later I looked for the temperature outside and the outside units batteries are dead. I almost fell on the floor from laughter. If, for no other reason, you have to love Amazon for allowing truthful comments on products.These comments are right on."
1,Accurate but eats batteries,"Although this unit is accurate and convenient, it needs batteries every month or less. Unfortunately, I have several and they are all the same. Buy another brand."
1,piece of junk,My experience agrees with the other reviewers. It eats batteries at such an alarming rate it's essentially useless. The maker should take it off the market.
1,"Sucks batteries, doesn't work with non-alkalines","Yup, sucks batteries. Doesn't work with non-alkaline batteries: rechargeables are nominally 1.2 volts, but this requires the 1.5 volts out of each battery, otherwise the display is too dim to view and it doesn't receive data from the remote sensor."
1,WORTHLESS,"I got this a couple of weeks ago and could NEVER get the outdoor part to work. I now have the one that is supposed to be inside, outside and have to check it by opening my slider. I use my thermostat to my furnace and AC for the inside temp! NOT what I was expecting! Out $16.00 and very disappointed in product."
4,only perhaps accurate within 3-5F,"Bought two of these for both monitoring the garage temp and for a son's science fair project (insulation testing). They didn't agree within less than five degrees, no matter what we tried. Took them apart, there is not internal calibration adjustment. Battery life is good - I have had the garage one running on the same set of batteries as shipped with for a year with no issues. Threw the other one away."
2,"Works Great, But EATS BATTERIES",I have had one of these for a couple years now. It always works.....but requires nes batteries about 3 times a month!!! I would not buy this again.
4,Good thermometer for price,"I purchased this from amazon and it has served me for years. Battery usage seems pretty normal, change maybe once or twice a year on the outdoor and less on the indoor. No mechanical problems and outdoor thermometer withstood snow, rain, direct sunlight... until it got swept away by strong winds and I couldn't find it. Will probably order another one since it's so cheap."
2,AcuRite Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer,Prompt delivery. The unit works but is very slow to change temp. reading. Tested it by placing inside a hot car (about 100 degrees) then I held it directly in front of the car's A/C vent ( about 40 degrees). Thermometer was too slow in showing the correct temp. This unit is not going to work for me. I would recommend spending more money and get something that works much faster if accurate temperature readings is what you are after.
2,Not long lasting,"This unit worked for about a year for me, but when the temperature reached 90+ this summer, it stopped working for good."
4,A Sign for Collectors,"You have to be a Talon fan to want one, or if you know a Talon maintainer of flyer they will appreciate this gift for the Man Cave, garage, or office. My only complaint would be a little bit more detail on the T-38 would be nice. At least USAF on the fuselage instead of just ""US"" would be nice. It came well protected in it's box and I do like the quality of the metal sign, it should last a long time. Some purist might want it to say T-38A or T-38C, but I am not that picky. A very nice momento to my years of working on T-38A Talons."
2,Not Great,A bit disappointing. The Coopers are obviuosly much wealthier than the average cruiser and therefore don't answer the questions on budget cruising. Also I find the book a bit too witty which does'nt help the authors' credibility. Their ability as sailors is also questionable considering their choice of craft which resembles a oversized houseboat the types of which one finds on inland lakes and lagoons.In spite of this there is a lot of information particularly of the Mediteranian which is useful.
2,There are better Books out there,"This book has little to do with sailing and even less to do with selling anything. The author is highly opinionated and some times condescending toward people with different ideas, which is very distracting. The book is slanted towards the Mediterranean and Europe and is more an account on their experience from their travels. Which I might add is on a 60' steel barge, which was converted to a motor sailor. Some useful knowledge was gained by reading this book but there are far better books out there."
4,Good ferret toy,"My Ferrets like it, and so does my cat. Bell is safely secure inside, and fabric is durable enough to have some wear and tear."
5,Inner Child Cards,"This deck truly offers something different than the traditional RW decks. It was interesting to see how many fairy tales are in our heads and how much information can be remembered by reviewing how we feel about these stories. The readings encourage imagination and communication from the inner child. They do touch the inner child in a simple, yet profound way."
1,Cards are larger than my hands!,"After months of research, I found these cards and wanted them because of the artwork. I had asked for these cards for my birthday and I finally got an Amazon gift card. I immediately put an order in for them the same night. They arrived less than a week later.I am sorely disappointed and am returning the deck. The cards are larger than my hands and I am a full-grown adult. How is someone supposed to do a reading with these cards? I am very resentful that the gigantic size isn't stated anywhere in any advertising that I've seen."
2,the cards are too large,I read it in another review but did not pay attention.So I just want to emphasize again that the cards are really uncomfortably large in size!
2,Don't buy! Bad quality! As soon as i took it out of the box it broke!!,"as soon as i took it out of the box to put it on the mantle (Im a Collector) the leg came off. Literally i carefully opened the box cut the plastic grips with scissors, lifter the figure up the leg came off. WTF Dont Buy. Bad Quality."
2,Debney and Keith Green: coincidence?,"Seeing (and hearing) 'Dragonfly"" on the Chiller network tonight- one one the songs from the soundtrack- or rather the theme melody that runs as a leitmotif throughout the soundtrack- kept teasing at me, not unlike that map symbol/cross that haunted our hero, Kevin Kostner. Obssessed, I kept listening, in my mind, to the unforgettable, melifluous tune...But then it came to me- ""That is familiar!""- lyrics came rushing in;""You want to love me,Well love with me then...""These, from the song ""Love With Me"" written by Keith Green, an astounding writer/performer (also a Christian)in the early 1980's. Hmmm...so similar it is startling- parallel invention? Subconscious enculturation? Or something else?Listen and, yes, enjoy the wonderful melody both John and Keith ""discovered"".BF"
3,Let's talk story,"I've read most of the surfing memoirs available and this is my favorite. If you want the great American novel, read Melville or Fitzgerald, but if you are a surfer and want to hear what it was like ""back in the day"" this is the book. I can only dream of what it was like to live in the Islands in the late 60's before the breaks and beaches got so crowded (with people like me) but Torrens lived it. The book is written in a conversational style that suits the topic perfectly."
1,Don't Buy - Misleading title,The book is a waste of money as far as I am concerned.Nothing new or revealing - just common sense stuff...
4,MISS YOUR TRAIN AND GET WEIRD,"This bizarre Dutch film, set in a remote area of the countryside, where a woman detrains for a moment at a whistle stop, then misses reboarding and finds herself indebted to the switchman, is a must see for lovers of off-beat movies.She stays, the seasons pass, strange things happen, all with practically no dialogue. The VHS version ending is well over the edge of the surreal. The DVD ending is an alternate ending, not quite as satisfying to me, but still the film is well worth watching.The Illusionist is droll relief with very little dialog, (the only subtitle option is in French for this Dutch movie) and continues to assure us that Jos Stelling is a very sly and weird guy who makes offbeat movies that delight some and leave others probably unappreciative of his unique talent: Vincent Canby just couldn't quite 'get' it."
1,Ridiculously poor service,"I have the book and wanted a 2nd copy for my daughter. The book is wonderful - the amount of detail is at the correct level and the comments are enlightening. It is the best scriptural commentary that I own. This review is NOT about the book, itself, but the supplier.Supplier: STARBURST BOOKIt has been 3 mos and no book. After a month, I managed to find an email address and asked ""when will you ship the book?"" It took about 10 days to get an answer (paraphrased), ""Oh, we're sorry - do you still want the book? - we'll ship it right away."" It's now been another month. Do these people want to be in business or not??? The reviews of the supplier were poor but the monetary risk was low (~$14) and I took a shot. QUESTION: Why does Amazon.com tolerate such poor suppliers?"
1,a joke,"I ordered something from this company in December 2006 and when I didn't receive it right away, I understood that it was Christmas season and kept the information aside. In July I have yet to receive it. When I questioned them about it, they sent me this generic response:Dear Customer,I got surprised with your email, because we sent you the order , and also surprised because you didn`t inform about it on time.I cannot help you by now. I am sorry.RegardsCustomer ServiceI have lost only 13 dollars, but more, I have lost respect for a company that can't do anything more than an automated response.What a joke."
4,Kind of Mellow,"I really wish Amazon had samples for this so you could hear it. I grabbed it on Usenet then ended up buying the CD here. As noted, it's Black Sabbath done note for note, but with mellower instruments and no vocals. Laid back. I love Sabbath and normally hate anything that smacks of Muzak or lounge music, but this is great. Perfect for putting on the background, and of course other Sabbath fans will wander over and ask, half repulsed but half curious, what the [bleep] this is.I'm not giving this 5 stars since it lacks the intensity I demand from 5 star CDs, but it's good stuff and well worth it for the price."
5,Wahoo,"I love it ! Somehow a friend of a friend gave me this because she knew I was a Sabbath fan- I was skeptical to listen , but WAHOO-- it is awesome ! I even listen to it in my office and people are always asking me about it- I love to tell them its Ozzy's old band -- Jazzed upside in!"
1,I have not received this item yet!,How can I submit a review of a product I have not received yet (since October 10th when I put the order)?I'll keep wating...
5,Good introduction to modern physics,"This book gives a good introduction to quantum physics, solid state physics, nuclear physics etc."
2,Skip it,"It's written for a practitioner, not a first time mother who needs a primer on the how's and why's of breast feeding. It seems dated and the tone is not entertaining as some reviewers would have you believe."
4,"A great straight forward, no nonsense reference","Great for answering many breastfeeding questions. Doesn't give the ""magic"" solution for getting a good latch but no book would. Could have a better index."
5,A Must Have for Breastfeeding Moms,This book contains all there is to know about breastfeeding and pumping. I bought this book while pregnant with my sixth child and after years of teaching childbirth education classes.. I still learned a lot! Buy it!
2,"Some good information, but high handed","I was looking for a book about breast feeding in general, and being a working woman, also information about transitioning to using pumps and bottles.The book does have good information regarding breastfeeding. However, the author goes on and on about nursing a child until he/she is a 4yr toddler and on the other hand has no information for a working woman. The author assumes, every woman is a homemaker and a mother's only purpose in life is to breastfeed. The worst part is, the book almost makes you feel guilty for leaving a child with a caregiver. If you are a working woman or one who plans to get back to work soon, stay away from this book, you certainly do not need the discouragement or guilt."
1,terrible!,"I found this book to be condescending and very biased. Though it contains good information, you have to sift through the authors' agenda (the formula world-wide conspiracy) to get to it. No one, not you or your doctors, knows as much as they do. Doesn't go into diet ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" and seems to assume that all mothers are staying at home. I'm glad I got this as a gift and didn't have to pay for it!"
1,Worthless. Go to a Lactation Consultant if you need help,Money is better spent on a lactation consultant than a book!
2,Disappointing unless you knew some of the characters involved,"I knew some of the people at this firm and couldn't wait to learn ""the backstory"". But I was disappointed.The reporting was good, I guess, but there was no drama, no story arc, and not a lot of interest. This happened, that happened, then something else happened. Like that. All the way through.If you knew some of the people involved, then this book *might* be interesting. If not, I'd skip it."
3,Least Lovable,"This is my least favorite of Munro's story-suites, the only one I wouldn't give five stars. Perhaps I'm simply defensive as a male reader, but the men in these stories seem more despicable than most of my friends and I find the women hard to share time with. These stories attend more to Munro's identity as a writer, also, making them annoyingly self-referential and literary. Whatever you do, don't make this collection your first encounter with one of the greatest writers of our lifetimes."
5,Great tales!,"Quirky, yet real. I believe I've known her characters. Like a fun vacation after having read a twelve-hundred page book."
3,"A mixed bag: some stories are great, others are terrible","Alice Munro certainly has the ability to create complex and fascinating situations, and to make them flow beautifully this way and that in time. Unfortunately, she only succeeds in using this ability about half the time. The other half, she's overly-self-serious, inaccessible, vague and flighty. Here are the stories that make the book worth checking out: Friend of My Youth, Five Points, Oranges and Apples (great story!), and Pictures of the Ice. You can skip Meneseteung and Hold Me Fast Don't Let Me Pass."
2,Frankly A Disapointment,Despite having read the book and having some anticipation for the film on that basis I wanted little else but to sit back and be entertained. I found the film to be flat and meandering with little drama nor coherent plot line. Anthony Hopkins a gifted actor was enjoyable to watch but really seemed only to be playing this part by the numbers. The film just never really seemed to pull itself together and take off. It occurred to me that probably watching this film accompanied by the Directors commentary would prove to have been a more satisfying experience. I would let this one go and rent it on VHS the next time you visit your local video store. Pity as with many films it could have been remarkable.
5,It was good,The other person that did the review didnt know what they were talking about I watched this movie twice and it was awesome both times
4,"Excellent on its own, dissapointing compared to the book","Hearts in Atlantis is a heart-warming, beautiful coming-of-age story, similar to King stories such as Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. The acting is excellent, and the flow is wonderful. However, the movie is a total change from the original , much better, story in the novel. The title loses all original meaing, the main premise to the ""low men"" is changed and not fully explained in the movie, and the overwhelming feeling one gets after discovering the truth of anthony hopkin's character is different in the movie than the book.Yes its a great movie, but if you've read the book, you'll find yourself dissapointed."
5,OUTSTANDING,"This movie achieves a very nearly perfect balance of suspense, pathos, nostalgia, and whimsy. The setting and overall atmosphere of the film are particularly superb, to say nothing of the characterizations. The plot is absorbing, credible and well-crafted.I plan to see this movie a second, maybe even a third time and will definitely add it to my collection when it becomes available for purchase.Highly recommended."
1,did not stream well,The video was easy to access but would constantly stop and reboot very frustrating. Took several hours to watch the whole movie. i am just glad I bought the DVD
4,Hopkins one of the best,"Good quality. Luv anything Hopkins does. This is a moving poignant movie, not Oscar material, but definitely worth your time to watch."
5,Heart-Warming Growing Up Story,"Anthony Hopkins is outstanding as the Stranger who comes to board in the widow's upstairs rooms. Her young son is played with surprising skill by a youngster whom I have not previously seen. Fine direction lends weight to the the performance of the young girl, the girl-friend, and all parts are filled as one would hope them to be. A movie for everyone in the family, plucking the right cords of sentiment without goo-iness."
4,"Comment re movie purchased from Amazon ""Hearts in Atlantis""",Loved the movie BUT this copy was way too DARK. Not like one might see on a cable movie channel.
4,Good,"it was a good movie, i will watch this more then once, great story line and awsome job on all actors parts"
3,It missed completely,"Having read the book before seeing this movie all I can say is that it missed completely in capturing magic, the evil and the otherworldly eeriness that made the book such an enjoyable read. What is left is a ""B"" grade version of ""My Girl"" told from the boy's prospective with a unlikable mom and a weird old guy with ESP. If you've read the book, skip this movie. If you haven't read the book skip this movie and read the book."
2,Substandard,"I personally was incredibly disapointed with this film. First off, i understand that it is very difficult to write a screenplay based on a Stephen King novel, they are very involved and discriptive. This movie only had a basic skeleton of what actually occured in the book. I think they skipped over very touching parts that should have been included, and i agree with the above reviewers in their thoughts on the low men and such. I was dissapointed to see that absolutely none of the other parts of the book were included, which led to viewers being puzzled as to what was going on. I found it very vague and sappy. I was disapointed to say the least."
2,You can skip this one,"I love Anthony Hopkins as much as the next person, but this movie had several flaws:(1) nothing much happens;(2) Anthony Hopkins speaks with a slur that I guess is supposed to imply world weariness, but instead is just annoying;(3) Anthony Hopkins spouts trite observations (""we're all just passing through, kiddo, just passing through"") that are meant to imply wisdom, but instead are just annoying;(4) the movie could have ended at any one of its last four scenes, and nothing would have been lost.However, I don't think the movie's awful. There are a couple of scenes that are outstanding, the best of which is a conversation that Hopkins has with a local bully. And the young protagonist's girlfriend was perfectly cast and excellently played."
2,Read the book instead,"I just finished reading the book for the second time last week, and I just got done watching the dvd tonight. I've read everything by Stephen King and I think this book may be the best. The movie is not bad; Anthony Hopkins is well cast and does fine here, but the movie is like a reader's digest condensed version of a masterpiece that should not be touched. I know - you say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time the heart of the novel was removed. The characters were so much more developed, the story more supernatural. The book is a masterpiece that captures the spirit of the 60's, the magic of childhood, and the inevitable loss of everything. Skip the movie and spend an enjoyable week reading."
1,Awful,"This film was especially depressing to watch considering the talent involved. But Hopkins gives his standard low-eyelid performance (he used to have energy. Rent THE LION IN WINTER). William Goldman writes the laziest script he's written yet. He was great once upon a time, but he's been in decline for awhile now, and I've given up on him with this one. In a recent interview he said he stopped writing novels because, ""There's a lot more white space on a script page, so it's less work. A novel is much more work with all those words per page."" Yes, he actually said that! People can be lazy even when they're earning million dollar pay checks! Well, his once brilliant prose started to turn lousy years ago, and now that laziness has crept into the ""easy labor"" scripts of his, so now they're crap, too. I think if they weren't phoning it in, both men could still do great work. But I've given up. This film stinks."
1,"Read the book, Skip the Movie","I read the book first and it was fantastic. First off, the book contains 5 stories all related back to the first one. The movie is based on the first one, and I guess the fifth although it changed a lot. Yet, about the movie, it was boring, to be blunt. The movie skipped all the good parts of the book and if it didn't skip it, the movie had it different and for the worse. I was expecting a much better film so I of course went out and purchased the dvd. If anything- rent it. And if you haven't seen the movie or read the book then I highly recommend the book and skip the movie."
4,Hearts In Atlantis - the movie,"I really love the book this movie was based off of, and as far as Stephen King movies go, they don't always do the books justice. In this case, I really liked the adaptation and felt the actors did a great job portraying these complex characters. The cinematography of the story was also very well done. I love the book very much and enjoyed the movie, too - hopefully you'll feel the same after seeing this film and, if you haven't read the book - maybe you will!!"
5,Warm and Engaging,"This movie is an awsome story of friendship, life, and love. This story is very engaging and will hold your interest from start to finish. Anthony Hopkins gives another brilliant performance with this effort. I love a movie that is different than other movies and takes a lot of twists and turns and this movie delivers in spades. It's such a tremendous depature for a Steven King story. It doesn't contain any horror at all but what he has accomplished with this movie is nothing short of fantastic. I just love this movie!"
3,What's the point of it?,"The movie was good, I have to say. I enjoyed most of it. But when it got to the end, it was like a person playing Hot Potato, left with the potato on his hands... They totally blew the movie away, when they didn't know how to really round it up. The concept was nice (although there were some loose ends), but the end could have definitely been deeper than it was. Dissapointing to say the least..."
1,Nothing happens!!!!!,"Thismovie hasnothing: it has no climax, no definite plot, no strong characters, no moral lessson, only great performances by Hopkins and the kid."
5,Stephen King: Not just all blood and guts,"Hearts in Atlantis is an excellent film that pulls at your heart-strings and causes you to make parallels with your own childhood.Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job in playing the mysterious character of Ted as well as the rest of the cast who round out this effecting tale of lost innocense and relationships lost.I found the story to be quite interesting and it kept my attention throughout. I found the relationship between Ted and Bobby very moving and sad all at the same time.Even if one is not a fan of Stephen King, give this one a shot. It is more along the lines of ""The Green Mile"" rather than an ""It"" or a ""Dreamcatcher.""The last lines of the movie sum this wonderful film up nicely and leave the viewer feeling a strange combination of sadness and inspiration all at once. I highly recommend this film. One of Stephen King's best adaptations. My complements to director Scott Hicks."
1,a great story turned bad,"If you haven't read the book by Stephen King, you should. It is one of the best stories I've ever read. The story was very original and imaginative. Not that that's a rarity for a Stephen King story. Many of Stephen King's brilliant works have been turned into excellent movies and many of his stories have been turned into terrible movies. Unfortunately, Hearts In Atlantis falls under the second catagory.This was by far the most dissapointing movie I have ever seen."
4,Good film if you can accept the sci-fi premise,"I enjoyed the suspenseful part of this film. Anthony Hopkins does a good job, in a Hitchcock sort of way, to keep viewers interested."
1,Where's the other two thirds?,"This movie is fair as far as it goes but it only covers 1/3rd of the book. They left more out of this movie than they did of ""The Shining"" and that was a disgrace. Rent, but don't buy."
5,A Fine Piece Of Work From Hopkins,"A very good job by one of the great ones.....Anthony Hopkins does a wonderful job as Ted Brautigan interacting with 11-year-old Bobby Garfield, played quite well by Anton Yelchin. The nostalgic narration of the people, places, and times where 3 childhood friends grew up is extremely well done. It's a good coming-of-age story with a regular series of moments when his selfish mother, played by Hope Davis, infuriates anyone who has ever experienced any kind of competent parenting.There are lots of good moments in this one. Lots of reasons to take the time to enjoy it. And lots of places where you can easily engage in the lives of the characters."
2,"OK movie, but regretably it dove into stereotypes.","The plot wandered without much purpose for half of the movie but was not particularly bad. However when the inevitable representation of evil was selectd to be a (probably) self hating closet teenage gay (or maybe cross dresser - you couldn't be sure)I was [angry]. I thought that the era of Hollywood gay stereotyping was beyond us. ... Worse, the lesson that Hopkins' character gave to the little boy was that it was dandy to blackmail the evil teenager to shame him into submission. What a message. Shame on you. If you have gay sensitivities, this unnecessary plot line will dominate your impression of the film and kill it - justifiably so."
2,"Mediocre mimicry of other, better films","This movie felt really contrived. While I tend to like just about anything Anthony Hopkins is in, this role wasn't meaty enough for his talents. The movie reminded me somewhat of Stand by Me, which was much better done and which I felt this one was trying to imitate, albeit with the seams showing. In Hearts in Atlantis, I couldn't get past how unrealistic the lines of dialog assigned to the children were. They spoke and acted with a maturity that is way beyond their tender ages of eleven, and it didn't seem natural. It ruined the movie for me. I kept thinking ""real people don't speak and act this way."" The plot just dragged along, and I kept waiting for the movie to ""start."" And then it was over. I detected stylistic elements of The Green Mile in it, in terms of mood and format (including even a common actor to both movies, David Morse). In fact this movie reminded me of numerous others. Only problem is, they were all better."
1,worse adaptation ever!,"If you enjoyed the book this is based on, don't waste your time watching this piece of dreck which is similar only in title!"
1,Disappointing - Not like a Stephen King story.,"Although Anthony Hopkins is one of my favourite actors, even he couldn't get this one going for me.I though the children were good actors, but the story line lacked something. I didn't know anything about this story before watching it ,( I prefer it like that if possible) so went in with an open mind.I appreciate what the story was getting across, but it didn't make particular good viewing. I read the write-up on the back of the DVD and it stated, ""it'll grab you...and keep you hooked"" I didn't feel this at all. It also calls it a ""tear-jearker,"" didn't agree, ( and I usually cry at anything in films).Disappointed with this film, not what I expected from a combination of Stephen King and Anthony Hopkins."
2,Ho-Hum,"I must admit that I am reviewing this with a little bit of bias because I am a fan of the original Stephen King story, and I feel it would have been better if certain supernatural elements were left in. I can understand why they were left out thought, it would have been confusing to non-King readers. The movie itself is passable enough. It is nothing the would stay imprnted on your phyche for any amount of time. Anthony Hopkins delivered a good preformance as usual, the kids in this seemed kind of wooden at times and some of the dialog seemed down right silly. ie: ""I thought we were going to fall to our doom!"" or ""You can sleep on the pullout couch it is ever so comfortable."" I expected a little better out of William Goldman. See it if your a fan just don't expect too much."
3,"the cast, the acting Great","the problem with this film too me is it's too .... short.. This film should have been longer in my opinion.and there is much story that could have been explored more!The film is a good film but never reaches what it could be! this film could be a true Masterpiece! but.... it just stays at being a good film.I could see given this film 4 stars, but i'm so angry at what it could have been that I'll give it three stars.I wish I was the one put behind this movie. :(oh one thing that must be noted the acting, the cast well That is where this film shines!"
1,Shallow indeed compared to the Book.,"The book has been gutted to produce an easy to direct and promote screenplay. Some of the other reviewers have said that two thirds of the story are missing. I'd say more like three quarters deleted. No real special effects to muck things up.After youve read the excellent novel-- this movie's production feels like rich kids at play--on a budget. Is it horrible? No. Is it good? No. You may like this movie, of course. However, if you love this movie, it would usually be out of sentiment for it's treatment of the time period in which it takes place. A remake is already in order. Stephen King's coattails must be a great ride, all the way to the bank."
3,"Simplistic, watered-downed version of a powerful novel.","I read the novel HEARTS IN ATLANTIS about 2 weeks before seeing the movie. While this film stands on its own as a nice film with good performances, it is NOT even close to the novel's powerful stories.I read two points in another review that I feel are incorrect. First of all, the novel is about 520 pages (not 800), and secondly, while some may choose to see the stories in the novel as separate, I couldn't disagree more.Watching these character's lives unfold thru the years was incredible. In the novel there was suspense until the end about bobby's fate. In the movie, it was gone - you know from the first minutes how his life turned out.I guess the bottom line is, if you enjoyed the movie, read the book and get ready for a REAL treat....."
2,Don't bother if you are a fan of Stephen King,"This movie version of the Stephen King book falls way short. If you have never read the book, or are not a fan of Stephen King, you will probably enjoy this movie. The problem is, the movie only covers the first HALF of the book. The book is written as five separate stories that all connect in the end. Ironically, the section of the book titled ""Hearts in Atlants"" is NOT even featured in the movie. READ THE BOOK!!! Other then that, Anthony Hopkins does give a great performance. Blame the screenwriter for butchering the original story, even the ending of the part of the book it does feature is totally changed from the book."
2,Watchable But Disappointing,"This is a syrupy nostalgic film.I wasn't convinced by the spotty acting of the children in this film. I constantly felt like they were acting.Hopkins was good as usual but doesn't make the movie believable or interesting by himself.This movie tries hard to tug at your heart strings and make you feel sad you're not eleven years old again, powerless, held down by your totally uncaring mother, subject to occasional beatings and violence at the hands of older children, and totally confused.There are some good parts and you will want to see the ending, but there are better vehicles for Hopkins than this."
2,Huh?,"This movie has all the positive things mentioned in the other reviews on this site (cinematography, acting) but I don't think it tells much of a story. There are too many elements which are never really addressed. This movie is essentially a rather dull coming of age story, except the kid's neighbor is a psychic pursued by the government. I love Stephen King, but sometimes Hollywood fails to adapt his works well, and I think that this is one of those occasions. I just thought it was a dull, mostly pointless movie."
2,"""Whats the point?""","After reading the book and only being mildly entertained, I hoped for a condensed version of the entire book--rather than just the beginning saga. I did feel that the movie did a good job following the story line, until the low men were portrayed. In the book these 'men' were portrayed as evil beings from some weird parallel universe, not evil businessmen. In the book the cars they drove were glowing, monstrous variations of actual luxury cars. In the movie they were just big black cars. The portrayal of Bobby Garfields mother was not nearly as heartless in the movie as in the book. I felt that this movie was a typical flop when compared with the book. I'm sorry to say I don't recommend this movie."
4,Hmmm... Not what you expect from Stephen King,"This is an interesting film. I have so stereotyped King into the horror and terror category that this was quite unexpected.Set in the days of J. Edgar Hoover and the tracking down of Communists. Anthony Hopkins is on the run from Hoover's men. It is not really explained why. But as the movie progresses you discover that he has a very powerful psychic personality and that has something to do with it.The little boy does a wonderful job. I am not sure if they got any awards for this film, but they should have at least gotten some high level recognition."
1,Another Butchering of a Stephen King novel,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie, as I usually am with those adapted from Stephen King novels. I read the book first (big mistake if you want to enjoy the movie), and found myself utterly let down by the re-writing of the story. I was really hoping to see the plot on the big screen, and instead I saw someone else's misguided attempt to play down the intensity of a profound topic: war. This movie should never have been made if the writers/directors did not intend to stick with Stephen King's exact writings, with exceptions made for time constraints. Frankly, they didn't even scratch the surface, and the changes they made were appalling."
5,Great flick!!,"If you enjoyed Stephen King's ""Stand by Me"" you will enjoy this Stephen King story. It is filled with nostalgia for those who grew up in the fifties, but it transcends any period. It is about a boy's ""last summer of childhood"". To quote Anthony Hopkins' charachter, ""When you are young you have such moments of great happiness that you think the world is magical much as Atlantis must have been. Then you grow up and your heart gets broken."" It is told from the perspective of a man about fifty looking back into the past at two very special relationships that he had in his childhood. It is masterfully directed. The cinematography is truely a work of art. I love this flick."
4,A queasy look at childhood.,"Yikes, I saw a sneak preview of this Anthony Hopkins film just a few hours ago, and I have not yet been able to tell my friends exactly what it was about. Primary focus is on childhood, what life offers, and the punishments for those who can really appreciate it. There is great irony, symbolism, and mistique to this film. My friend said it would be an ""English teacher's dream"" to teach, for all of its metaphors and devices. If I cannot say whether the central idea was good or bad, i can at least say that it was moving to the point of disturbing. The closing voice over narration was beautiful and eloquent, reminding me of emotions stirred up while watching Speilberg's A.I. Perhaps just Like that movie, I cannot really proscribe a ""good"" or ""bad"" rating for it."
3,Moving but follows simple ideas,"The old trick of going back to childhood is a sure ticket to the peoples' hearts and this film is moving and smells nostalgia. Anthony Hopkins gives a fine performance as always, even with a script that does not have many surprises. The young actors are also excellent in their roles and the depiction of rural America of the 60s very good also."
1,I was robbed,"I gave this a one star for one reason. I was not able to select zero stars. I WAS ROBBED. I bought this DVD elsewhere, also I bought it because Anthony Hopkins was in it. A gentleman whose work I admire. More importantly I bought this DVD AFTER I read the book. I am angry and disgusted for having wasted the money buying this trash. They took 75 percent of Mr. Kings fine novel and threw it away. This movie is only a brief portion of the book. Of the portion that was portrayed there was so much missing. I was so disgusted with the movie that I threw away the DVD. There was a tremendous amount of the story that was simply disregarded. I was as disgusted with this movie as I was with the movie version of IT. I strongly advise anyone to not buy this movie, by the book instead. If you did buy this movie, return it."
2,Alright,"It would be a fine movie, with a moving storyline, but the child actors were the worst I've ever seen in my life. ever. they ruin the movie. they need to get better actors before they make a movie. Yikes. Anthony Hopkins was great though."
1,Terk Smart HDMI Switch,"The switch would not switch between HD DVR Cable box and a Blu-ray Player.It would not work with the player,even with the cable box disconected."
1,Does not work as advertised - I returned it,"This device would not ""let go"" of an active input, even with manual switching and so the second input would never be active. I literally had to uplug one HDMI input to get the other to work - useless! I returned it to Amazon and bought a Radio Shack 3 x 1 HDMI switch that can be remotely controlled from my DVD player's remote. That works perfectly. Stay away from this one."
4,"Practical, specific and very useful","I read this book in one afternoon. I applied the ideas and have had a far more productive garden in less space with far less effort than before. Ball's book presents specific information, complete with shopping lists for materials and sources of hard-to-find products. He also includes information on companion planting, scheduling and organic approaches. I wouldn't be without it!"
5,Excellent resource,"I checked this book out of the library over and over while getting my garden established. I am finally going to go buy a copy. Jeff has great ideas for making your garden less work and more fun. He gives practical advice in an engaging, readable style. If you're interested in gardening, and either a new gardener or looking to shake your style up a little bit, I recommend this book!"
1,"My ears are bleeding, make it stop!","If I could rate this any lower I would... the singing is horrid, it sounds like a bad night of karaoke... Music Of The Night is enough to make one vomit... Phantom Of The Opera sounds like a bad internet MIDI file... SKIP this... buy an ALW collection that has the actual singers... or Michael Crawford's ""Music Of Andrew Lloyd Webber"" Anything is better than this piece of garbage.It should be named, ""When Good Music Goes Bad"" or ""When Bad Things Happen To Good Music"" or even better, ""Nightmare On Broadway""How about I just be more blunt.... I would rather poke my eyes out with a spork than ever listen to this disgustingly, horrifying CD and I strongly suggest you not get it. Save your ears and mind's by getting Michael Crawford, or... anyone... but these people!"
2,"Instead, Order the Original for more pages and a cheaper cost","As a natural hair stylist I was so disappointed in this book after seeing the original text book at a Natural Hair Event and Training in Atlanta. When I ordered this book I had no idea it would be a mini version of what I needed for my future natural hair classes and seminars. WOW ! For $100 it is not worth it. I wanted the ""original"" with the actual photocopies of our ancestors. But for $25 yes. I hope I can get my refund. Order the Original from 619.668.1007"
2,Watch out for the size,"The product looks great but it is a lot more smaller than expected.I currently use size 9 for several other pairs of golf shoes from different brands.I bought these in size 9,5 thinking they would fit, but THEY DON'T!!!"
5,Amazing...,"My grandfather gave me a tape of this album way back a few years after it first came out, which was in 1983. I can't describe the music - French Impressionistic New Age instrumental? Regardless, it's absolutely gorgeous. I recommend listening to it when you just want to get the heck away from it all."

4,A harmless ancestor to teen sex comedies,"For those who grew up watching the ""American Pie"" movies, the ""La Boum"" films must seem silly, harmless and bland. If you expect to see a lot of nudity and hear a lot of raunchy jokes, don't bother with this movie. If you want some harmless family fun and some conversational French practice - rent or buy ""La Boum""."
4,Awesome movie!,"This movie is so hilarious! My French class laughed aloud through the whole thing, but I will never get that theme song out of my head!!!"
5,bon bon,I watched this movie in french class it is so funny usually i hate french class but i was laughing my booty off
3,Cute,"Not a book to be considered significantly informational or overly weighted with details. However, it is a cute one. Allow yourself to be amused even if some of the stories are a bit familiar. Its a book to read when you want to relax and be entertained not when you want to study and be educated. It may qualify as a guilty pleasure."
2,Royal Scandals,It was just trash and I tossed it after several pages. It did not read like a novel. Move to the works of Massie on Russian history instead. Delivery was prompt.
5,Fun to Read,"Say what you will about history, but this book made history fun. My teenagers even read it. The miracle continued when they started researching even more to answer questions. We had a lot of meaningful conversations about history, differing interpretations of resources and comparing it to modern day antics. That is a dream come true for a father who is also a history teacher. Sure, it is not written like a textbook, but that is the point. Textbooks are often boring. This book got my children interested in European history. If you liked ""Schoolhouse Rock"" as a kid, the teenager in you will love this book."
4,The History your teacher never talked about.,"A Treasury of Royal Scandals is an incredibly entertaining look at the men and women who have held power throughout the centuries. Farquhar's writing style is easy to follow and reads more like a novel rather than the usual historical prose. Writing on the gulity pleasures and outrageous behavior of everyone from Catherine the Great of Russia to England's Henry V, Farquhar describes in detail a symphony of information and jaw dropping behavior that is almost to obsurd to believe.The book is laid out nicely in different sections with different themes that are coherent and easy to follow even if you aren't a student of history and are unfamiliar with names from the past. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who would like to know how kings and queens, princes and princesses, and even popes lived out their outrageous lives that make today's world leaders incredibly dull by comparison!"
2,Questionable,"This book was obviously written more for entertainment and shock value than historical accuracy. While a fair majority of the tales are well-written, the incorrect information is keeping me from enjoying the book. The relationships between royals in particular are exaggerated and described in a very one-dimensional manner. Not sure if it was worth the amount I paid for it. Eleanor Herman was a much better investment."
3,"Entertaining, a bit simplistic","A tabloid of rulers-it was amusing, but I felt it was a bit simple and not fleshed out well. I also felt the price was a bit high for this book, but I did enjoy it, and if you just want a gossipy, easy read, it is good for that."
3,Looking at the royals as most have never seen them,"This book details all the sexual and psychological peccadilloes of royalty. The main focus is European royalty from the Middle Ages to the present, but some discussion of ancient Rome is thrown in towards the end. It's a wonder the royals stayed on top as long as they did. Pure brain candy."
2,Not as funny as I'd hoped,"The cover picture is a bit misleading, this book isn't really very funny. If you don't know anything about European history, you may find it interesting, but if you do know anything about the sujbect, there isn't lilkely to be much in here to surprise you. Mr. Farquhar has strong prejudices, he doesn't like Queen Victoria, who he refers to as a 'sourpuss' (she wasn't) and prefers her lecherous son Edward VII. He tells us that George I was a 'distant' relative of the Stuarts (actually he had as much Stuart blood in him as the Pretenders, which is to say not very much). The book is divided up rather strangely, anecdotes about various monarchs are scattered through the book, so there are bits of Elizabeth I in one part, more bits in another part etc. Will Cuppy did this sort of thing so much better."
3,Fun Book; Putrid Audio Performance,"I wish I could rate the content and the performance separately. The book lives up to its promise, is fun and goes down easily. I can forgive its sometimes cloyingly cutesy-ness (Peter the Great is a ""Super-Tsar,"" nyuck-nyuck).The reading, however, is so bad that I cannot believe it was released. Okay, not all royals are British, but certainly none of them are American, as is this bland, choppy reader who hasn't a clue how to pronounce many of the names in the stories. I could not believe my ears when I heard him read that King Henry VIII's young daughter Mary implored her father to imagine her ""prostate"" before him. It's just barely listenable and only because I need something to listen to while I waiting for my local library to receive the next unabridged audio installment of the Outlander series. Having just listened to the fabulous Davina Porter read those books further diminishes the pitiable attempts of Johnny Heller to read Royal Scandals."
5,SHOCKING AND HILARIOUS!,"I was randomly searching Amazon one day looking for something interesting to read and I came across this book completely by accident. I ordered it and have read it at least twice all the way through. Farquhar's dry wit and the contents of the stories (although there is no proof to the legend that Catherine the Great ""loved"" her horses as much as is often told, there are other stories of her life that are stranger than any fiction) make this book a ""must read"". I only wish he would write a sequel!"
4,FEW DULL MOMENTS..,"I was either laughing or reading with my mouth gaped. The information was abundant covering dozens of kings, queens, tsars, popes and emperors. The well written book leaves me eagerly awaiting for the arrival of The Treasury of Great American Scandals to my door step. Not overly intense, but enough to keep you wanting more."
4,Royally a delight,"I read this book for a history book review. I found it entertaining, yet informing. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to read interesting books that aren't about everyday life."
2,Terrible!,"While the book does give factual information, it is extremely biased (the author calls one of the characters a ""nincompoop""). He constantly refers to the previous chapters and everything he writes is extremely repetitive. This book is not for historians looking for an interesting and unbiased read; rather than being historical, it seems to come from the pages of a gossip column. Save your money and time."
1,Disappointing..,"I was excited about this book when I first came across it, but as I read into it, I was very disappointed. Not only is the author's writing style a little elementary, with several cliché and phrasing that made me cringe, but also much of his information is hearsay and assumption. I suspected as much as I read through the novel and my suspicions were confirmed as I read over passages that I knew to be factually incorrect(eg, the assesment of Marie Theresa's marriage). It seems that the author has attempted to make this subject appeal to a soap opera type audience and it simply isn't historical. For a work of fiction, it is mildly entertaining, although, as mentioned, poorly written. Save your money."
2,No depth,A flat narration of some historical events. A surprisingly boring read for such a juicy subject.
2,"Way too dumbed down, even for fun history reading.","True, I did want a fun historical read, a sampling of royal and papal blackguards, but Farquhar's book is clogged up with cliched prose. It is just not skillfully written or edited. He takes the old historical chestnuts and does little with them but paraphrase such works as Suetonius, etc. I'm surprised at the Penguin imprint--I expected far better. This work is so light, it is often juvenile."
2,Too Basic,"I was really looking forward to getting this as I love history and a book of royal scandals sounded interesting. Unfortunately, Farquhar writes about the scandals that are too well-known and have been thoroughly covered for hundreds of years (did you know that Henry VIII had 6 wives and had 2 of them beheaded?? Egads!). It would have been great if Farquhar could have chronicled more interesting, unknown facts about these famous scandals, or even dug up scandals that haven't been covered a million times (there are no shortages of those), but if you know anything about history, you will learn nothing more from this book."
3,not bad,"this book reads like a long magazine article focusing on obvious characters from english royalty and a few others thrown in for good measure.the small section focusing on the roman emporers was appreciated. but overall i was hopng for smething a little more shocking or exotic. i would have rather read obsolute most shocking tales of royal abuse from world history, than mildy sordid tales isolated in england and france.not a bad read, but it seems like the author isnt really going for it."
4,ROYAL GOSSIP,"This book is a very fun read. I especially liked the story on Louis XIV's brother, he must have been a hilarious spectacle. Honestly you wonder how these people were allowed to rule, they were so hedonistic and debauched, but frankly that's what makes this book so amusing. Though this book is quite good, the benchmark on these type of books is Royal Babylon, that book is fantastic, it has more stories and is more explicit, but honestly, I recommend them both, although they cover some of the same ground, they compliment each other."
5,We didn't learn this in school!,"I would loved to have known a few of these stories in high school! I loved this book, read it in about 3 hours, and am looking forwward to the next book. I was upset when I got to the end. I thought it was extremely interesting that there were so many evil popes in our history. It's amazing to me that Catholicism is still alive today! I love the author's writing style, it kept me chuckling and snickering throughout the book. He gives great detail to the appearance of some of the royalty, so much that I kept picturing obese old men with open festering sores all night. Thanks Michael! :)"
5,FIVE STARS,"Rarely have I found history written with such wit. I thoroughly enjoyed every page, especially the section on the bad popes. Farquhar has a way of illuminating even the worst royal excesses without ever being unjustly cruel. And, though the stories can be found in other history books, Farquhar retells them so well. A truly fun read."
3,Changing songs is a pain!,"The unit works fine but it is very frustrating to lose the TINY (and I mean TINY!) piece in order to change a tune. Luckily I'm a mom and I had tweezers handy - you need these to simply change songs. Of course this piece (did I say how TINY it was!?) fell inside the unit's circuit board and I had to unscrew the tiny screws and take off the back plate to find it. After some shaking, it became visable and I fished it out but there are all kinds of tiny spots where it could be wedged. It does have a nice selection of tunes but I dread going through this again, so I probably never will. There has got to be an easier design out there for the consumer."
1,pain in the rear end,This thing is a real pain. It does work but changing the song is a pain. You move this stupid jumper to the song you want. I mean come on. Did this company ever here about posh buttons? I am so upset with this awful product. It should get recalled. The reason i am so upset is that i wanted an easy to use wireless musical door bell with a lot of songs. This is not that. I am very unhappy. I will never by this thing ever ever ever again.
3,"Works well, loud, songs are mostly ice cream truck songs- here's video of changing songs","Length:: 2:16 MinsThis video shows the process of changing songs on the Heath Zenith musical doorbell. Songs on the doorbell are mostly children's tunes- (""Farmer in the Dell"" for your chime, anyone? How about ""Little brown jug""? You can be the ice cream man house) but the holiday ones are cute."
4,Musical Chime,Not sorry for this purchase. Works well. Enjoy all the different musical sounds that can be selected. Can be heard any place in the house.
4,Not a Good Buy For the Price,Works well I foumd one in the store for$36.00 I should have looked Around More.I need to be more Careful about what I am Buying.
3,"OK, but not as reliable as I had hoped for.","Bought the to replace an almost identical NuTone wireless that diad after 15 years. This one has more melodies but in reality, unless you want to change it every so often, you really omly use one. My only complaint is that the button at the door doesn't always work on the first push. If you wiggle it around a little bit, it will contact and the chime will ring as advertised. Unfortunately visitors don't know they sometimes need to wiggle it from side to side to make it ring."
1,Very poor range of operation,"Even though the manual claims upto 100 feet range, it doesn't work at even 15 feet!. My previous unit made by Desa (that company has the same address as Heath Zenith)was amazingly powerful. It easily went thru four walls. I don't need 64 chimes, just one I can hear 20 feet away. Don't buy this unless you need a very short range of operation. I give this unit only one star."
3,Poor sound quality,"Easy to install, but sound quality for this price leaves a lot to be desired. Range appeared to be somewhat of an issue as well. Much less than advertised."
3,"If you're gonna buy Extreme CDs, buy the whole catalog.","No compilation of Extreme songs, ESPECIALLY this one, can truly give you enough of a glimpse into the songwriting talent evident on Extreme's four studio albums. Skip this compilation and the other ones, and invest your money wisely in ""Pornograffiti"" and ""III Sides to Every Story"", the band's second and third discs, respectively. If you like what you hear (and you will), go ahead and round out your collection with their first and last releases, ""Extreme"" and ""Waiting For The Punchline"". All the records have their merits, but their second and third discs are masterpieces that deserve your immediate attention. This ""Holehearted"" collection is only a half-hearted attempt at capturing the true spirit of the band."
3,I was never a dedicated fan.,"I only really remembered the main Extreme songs that I saw the videos for on Much Music or heard on the radio. I liked what I heard of them but I didn't hear a lot from them. I thought I'd buy their Greatest Hits to get the ones I remembered and basically sample some of the ones I've never heard of. In the end, the ones I remembered were the best on the CD. The others are a little forgettable in my opinion. Again, I was never a dedicated fan."
1,"Love the Huskies, Hate the Book...","The other readers must have read this right after the Huskies won the championship--the fact that it was such an intoxicating moment for UCONN lovers must have hurt their judgement. I for one *LOVE* UCONN, yet this book reads like a rough draft. Calhoun also reveals little about the season that a devote UCONN fan wouldn't already know. I reccomend ""Huskie-Mania"" by Jim Shea for Huskie fans out there."
3,probably a cia disinformation specialist,"Noel Twyman claims to have spent 5 years of research on this book. That's more realistic than the immortal Posner, but I still can't buy it. I still think Howard Hunt was one of the 3 tramps, and anybody who doesn't think so(Twyman doesn't even mention the tramps) is a cia plant."
3,FIRST CLASS,"This book is frist class. First class printing, paper quality, investigations. But it is really heavy reading, some chapter are totally difficult to advance. Anyway, if anyone still thinks Kennedy was killed by a lone nuts called Oswald, read this one.."
4,BLOODY TREASON INDEED !,"Good book, almost on thousand pages printed in great type letters, so you don't destroy your eyesight reading it! Smartly written, full of insights of the writer, who frequently use the term ""I"" with no shame. Or say that this is ""a hipothesis"", with no shame also. Good writin style, great method of research (he explains to us his parameters). Good. Hey, Oswald didn't do it alone. Only a moron don't see it."
2,Review #2,"I reviewed this book (it appears no one has since) and admittedly was very colorful about initially being duped about LHO acting alone and how Mr. Twyman made it very clear that there was, in fact, a huge conspiracy. Well, good people, I DID get on the wrong bus. I got on the one that made me think anyone other than LHO killed JFK. I have since made a 360 degree turn, am compelled to retract my previous review, and feel that I at least owe you this information in case you want to purchase this book based in part on my previous review (someone found it useful). I still believe the book is easy to read and is well written, but it has found it's way to the bottom of my bookshelf. By the way...out of respect for Mr. Twyman in this review, I will not name the source of my revelation, but will tell you that the author's initials are ""GP"". Any guesses?"
5,A newcomer makes his mark in the Assassination investigation,"Noel Twyman, with a degree in engineering, and the time, contacts and money to do it right, has brought us a work of great value. He reviews most of the major conspiracy theories, and through his own research and logical deductions finally arrives at his conclusion, a conclusion that time may show is as close to the mark as any ever put forth. By combining in-depth personal interviews with suspects such as Gerald Patrick Hemming and high-ranking Kennedy/Johnson administration officials like Robert S McNamara, with scientific re-evaluations of the autopsy photos and Zapruder film, Twyman weaves his way to his final conclusion, which unlike most other conspiracy books, includes all the evidence. A must buy for all wanting to find the truth."
3,ANNELISE BRACELET,"IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY GREART NIECE AND THEY SAID IT WAS LOVELY....I SENT IT DIRECTLY TO HER, THEREFORE, I DIDN'T, ACTUALLY, SEE THE ITEM WHEN IT ARRIVED....THE RATING IS A GUESS!"
5,Essential Resource,"I was recommended this book by my mentor and professor because it is the latest and greatest reference for the subject area. Although the exposition emphasizes theoretical principles, the choice of specific topics is tempered by their practical significance and interest to both researchers and system designers. I have talked to others in the field about what resource they use most and this book is consistently named as the best of the best."
1,Empty case,"I received an empty DVD case. A well packaged empty DVD case! I was so mad, mainly because I was so excited about the purchase. LESSON LEARNED."
4,Loved It!,"I've been waiting a long time for R. Kelly to put out a live concert DVD and he didn't disappoint. I had a ball watching him perform and sing through so many of his hits. And each one made me reminisce on where I was at the time in my life. Hell, it's true that music is the soundtrack of our lives!His dvd is definitely 2 hours of fun that every R. Kelly fan should own. The only downside is the missing dance sequence. I mean I was at the concert, and I saw how R. did his thing with his dancers. So, it's too bad it was edited out cause folks need to know that boaw can dance!! But the dvd is a must have just the same."
4,one of the best,i think it was a good video but the songs were cut short and the songs that he performed the longest were not as popular but on the average a great performer of course he is r kelly
5,Great buy,I bought this dvd for a friend's birthday.....it was a really good buy....totally enjoyable performance by r. kelly
2,Doesn't even come close to their last release,"This is a total departure from their last album The Opposite Of December. I couldn't beleive what I was listening to at first. None of these tracks did anything for me, they simply don't have the impact of their older stuff. Most of this sounds like Wil Haven crossed with Deftones. This would be easier for me to accept if the songs were great, but there is nothing on here that even comes close to 'Sliced Paper Wrists' or 'Nerdy'. I am gutted about this."
1,a mockery of hardcore,"this album disgusts me, especially coming from the hardcore greats they are in opposite of december. what a letdown. i see no place in hardcore for winy emo, i think il just stick to true greats like burnt by the sun, zao, and the dillinger escape plan. absoluetely awful, dont even waste your time downloading songs"
3,Their worst full-length.,"This album, and this is my opinion, was kind of boring. The guitars were kind of weak, as well as the vocals, and the drums were not very energetic. This album did not feel very enthusiastic and it was kind of dull. I don't know what went wrong with this recording, and I was so excited after hearing 'Opposite of December.'Maybe it's because the songs are not as heavy or hard-hitting. I don't have a problem with softer songs, but it feels like they didn't really try to make any of these songs on this album memorable. Probably through experience will they get better at making these types of songs. I really only did enjoy the heavier songs on this album.At least the production and the mixing were better on this album. It's just too bad that there are only three or four good songs. What happened?"
5,Great...........Enough Said.,"Following in the wake of their first album, poison the well has created an entirely new monster with this one. Many people dont give it props because it lacks all the showy solos and kill me lyrics, but they replace that with raw emotion and feeling in each and everyone of the songs on this album. This album has a slower, slightly more melodic feel to it than T.O.O.D. (first record), but you can still hear many of the simmilarities that make it their personal sound. The ONLY weak part about this album is pretty much the same as its predecessor....it was too short. With these guys, a half hour simply wont do. The catchy hooks and well concieved writing and precise drumming in this album make it one of the greatest hardcore albums of all time....PERIOD!"
4,PTW is changing.,"I have been listening to PTW for a while now, and I was always quite impressed with all of their music, including both Opposite of December and Tear From the Red. Many people I have talked to dislike Tear From the Red because of how different it is from Opposite of December, but I believe that the diversity of the two albums shows Poison the Well's full potential and musical ability. Excellent CD - definetly frequently played at my house."
2,Utterly ridiculous,"I, like many others, was a big fan of ""Opposite of December."" It was a very solid release. Having said that...this album is mediocre at best. It seems as though any time that a hardcore band begins to incorporate melody into their music, they are immediately praised as visionaries. To be honest, most of this album reminds me of Incubus combined with a group of monkeys screaming randomly. Yes, it really is that bad. So many bands blend melody and hardcore music well. Poison the Well is not one of those. I do respect the hardcore PTW fans who stand up and defend this album and the band's right to be different. Unfortunately, different does NOT always mean good. You can do much, much better than this album."
3,The Next Phase,"Oh, I see that obviously being a hardcore band was not enought for these guys, as the new cool thing is to be a Deftones rip off band.Im not quite sure what all hardcore bands find so fascinating about the Deftones music, but I wish they would just stick to making there own music and not trying to be like them.This CD is pretty good but compared to the last one.Forget it mate."
5,one of the greatest ever,"I was reading these other reviews that some other people wrote, and i was literally getting extrememly angry and sick at the same time. this is an EXCELLENT CD!! they say it isnt hardcore enough and i cant even express how wrong that assumption is. I thank god everynite for the songs 'Sticks and Stones, Rings from Corona, Botchla, all so hardcore. Buy it, SO worth it"
5,Y&T was one of the best bands of the 80's .,"Y&T never received the recognition they deserved. Dave Meniketti was great on lead guitar and lead vocals. I don't know of a band that had a front man that played lead and sang lead. An album that I thought was excellent was Contagious. These guys put out some unbelievable rip on guitar solos. I've always been a Y&T fan and will continue to be one. I would group them with other bands like April Wine, Dokken, and Vandenberg."
3,they deserved better,"I bought this cd after a relative talked about seeing them in concert and how good they were in a live setting. From listening to this cd, I think that the biggest thing this band had going for it was Dave Meniketti, who is a great guitarist and an excellent singer. Unfortunately, a lot of the songs now seem derivative and cheesy and the production is often absolutely painful to listen to. These guys deserved better. I do like Rescue Me, Mean Streak, Midnight in Tokyo. Summertime Girls is pretty catchy too."
5,A must have,This truly is a must have for ANY Y & T fan or any fan of hair bands. Every song a classic.
4,"Nice product, nice company!","This is a well-made product and it looks very nice under my window. It arrived promptly but was missing the mounting brackets. I phoned the company and they were most polite and helpful, and agreed to complimentary fed ex next day air saturday delivery of the hooks when I asked. not longer afterwards, i received a pleasant VM saying fed ed would not deliver to my home on saturday and that the best they could do was MOnday and they asked if this was OK.I was impressed with how they stood behind their product and provided EXCELLENT cusomter service... something that seems increasingly hard to come by these days.Bravo! I highly recommend this vendor and would buy from again."
4,Kathleen Battle for the years of inspriration,"The biggest part of the lower rating does not deter from my great respect for Katleen Battle. She has a soulful rendition for the songs on the album. The song ""Going Home"" from ""Largo"" from symphony #9 in E minor creates an ease and soothing to my soul. I would recommend this album for any one who wants their soul to be touched."
3,Eh...,"Kathleen Battle is admirable, with her many recordings and her many performances across the country. But, I cannot say that I adore her voice. Yes, she may be a soprano, but her voice is not top of my list. Her technique is flawed, and her voice lacks any depth or richness. When I listen to her voice, it sounds so empty. Singers like Sumi Jo (my favorite of all) or Renee Fleming are a much better choice when it comes to rich tone and beautiful technique."
4,Magna cart,"Ordered it and it came in on time. Packaging was good. Product is nice and easy to use. Folds right up to place almost any place. Not for huge stuff like furniture but works well for ice chests, cases of water, boxes etc...don't grab the handle and just crank back on it or it will break. Use it wisely and it will serve you well just tilt your load back and you are off. Nice little product well worth the money"
4,So Handy!!!,"So handy when you need a hand! Folds very compact and easy to unfold for use. One drawback, and it is just a small one is the handle - it would be nice if just a little longer but still this cart is great!!! We used for hauling our full cooler and camping supplies for quite a way and this cart worked great!"
5,"tough, light, and compact little cart","i'm a drummer and my wife bought me one of these to help in hauling drums and hardware in and out of venues. i generally use this cart for hauling my hardware box, a large PVC box that weighs about 70 pounds when loaded.my magna cart *is not* treated gently or with kid gloves, and it has never failed. up stairs, down stairs, up and down off of stages, on every kind of paved or unpaved surface, no worries. folds up small enough to pack easily with my gear, weighs very little.tough, compact, light, durable. couldn't ask for more."
2,"Folds up nice, but very flimsy.","It folds up to fit in very small spaces which makes it great to store in a closet, or hanging in a garage. Unfortunately to allow it to fold has compromised it's integrity for items over 50 lbs. It's rated for 150, but I'm sure it will break if I try that.I attempted to move an apartment sized oven, which is about 50-60 lbs, and it creaked when I tried to lean the oven back. It rested very unstably on the cart. I was afraid of breaking the cart and dropping the oven, I ended up just carrying the oven by hand (it was that light).Get it if you only want to move small items, maybe a few boxes of paper or something. If you need more durability, you're going to have to spend more."
5,Sturdy and well made,"This is a wonderful cart! The large wheels and sturdy pull-up handle make it easy to push or pull, yet it folds compactly and lays flat when not in use. I got it to transport my massage table when I need to take it with me, but I will use it for luggage and other things."
2,"Awesome Idea, Poor Execution","This thing is conceptually designed extremely well. It folds up into almost nothing. However, the lip needs to be longer, and the wheel housings need to be made of metal. I had mine for one day before it broke, carrying a couple boxes. It claims it can transport up to 150 lbs, but the plastic wheel holders snapped with 50lbs tops on the dolly. Would love to buy it again if they can fix these major flaws."
3,"Don't be over 5'3""...","...at least, not very much over that height if you're not interested in contorting yourself into at least slightly uncomfortable positions in order to use this dolly. That's exactly my height, and I'm just able to pull this cart without having to slouch slightly; although, it seems that part of the problem is that the cart, whether you're pushing or pulling it, seems to have a tendency to want to upright itself. Beyond that, it's a perfectly serviceable cart if you don't demand too much of it. Just today, I used it to cart a 55 pound air conditioner from the pick-up point 8 blocks away, and then up 3 flights of stairs, and it came through just fine.So yeah, be on the short side, and don't be afraid to bully it slightly to keep it in position.It's not great, but it's good enough."
5,Better than expected,I have purchased handcarts in the past that were weak and broke soon after purchase.This Magna Cart is light but durable and strong. We are very pleased with it. It serves us well.
5,Very handy...,Works as advertised. Folds up compactly and unfolds very easily. Works great for hauling items back and forth that otherwise would have to be carried in several trips. Really helped in my recent move.
5,"Look no further, this is the one you want!","I realize there are already many reviews for this, but I felt I should add mine as well. This is an AWESOME hand truck. I love how compact it is. I remember seeing it folded up when it arrived wondering how something so well compacted would expand into a sturdy hand truck. But wow, it easily expanded into its full size and is the perfect size for moving things around. We are in the middle of moving and this is perfect for lugging a couple boxes from one room to another. We have Ozarka water delivered to our home as well and found this is PERFECT for grabbing those water jugs and transporting them inside. When you are done using it, you can simply fold it up and store it. It doesn't feel flimsy, like I expected it to, and I love the foothold, which makes it easier to start your lifting. This was inexpensive. For something this excellent, I would have paid twice as much!"
5,I use this a lot,"The hand truck folds flat and takes up very little room in the car trunk...I can usually find somebody to help put items in the trunk (50 lbs of feed) but getting these out and into storage would be impossible without my husband or this hand trunk...both are sturdy, work well on uneven sandy ground and are strong...but my husband stays here and you can order the hand truck from Amazon."
5,Great hand cart!,"This is a great hand cart! I bought it when my laptop backpack became too heavy and it really works great. Instead of spending over $100 on a wheeled laptop bag, I put the backpack on the magna cart with a bungee cord and voila! and saved $65. The cart is very light while still being very strong. I used it to carry 3 cases of bottled water up 2 flights of stairs and it performed beautifully. Good solid quality. You won't regret it."
5,Very useful and easy to use,I bought this hand truck for my wife for her to use in her business to move heavy crates. It is well made and very easy to use. It meets all her needs to move the crates and folds very thin.
5,Amazing!,"I was moving and desperately needed a hand cart as I had lots of boxes. This cart is light, compact but very sturdy and unbelievably well priced. I was able to move 3-4 boxes at a time and that makes a huge difference rather than carry one box at a time by hand. Initially when the cart arrived, it kind of looked flimsy and I wasnt sure it'll be able to handle the heavy boxes (books!). But it worked out really well. Its a little bit tricky to tilt the cart with the heavy boxes. But if you put your foot against the wheel and then push the box to tilt it, its easy. I just wish they had made the handle longer. I am 6ft tall and once the cart is tilted I needed to stoop while I pushed it around. Anyways, five stars without a doubt."
5,Excellent for moving,I bought this portable truck for moving. I really packed on the weight on this truck and it held like a champ. This thing moved everything in my house and some more without any damage to it or my stuff.
5,Good Sturdy product,"IT is as good as it seems. Strong, nicely designed. Wish it came with a bungie cord."
4,Personalized Load Lifter,"The magna cart is terrific for loads such as grocery shopping or people who may take public transportation and planning on buying and carrying a load home or any other medium weight loads to carry. It is unique in itself because it is foldable where a person can store it underneath the bed or wherever they wish to. It is small and convenient which carries up to 150 lbs. I, myself, a public transportation user, bring this handyman with me if I plan on buying loads that would be more for me to bear by arm and hand strength. A great item to buy."
5,Sturdy and affordable,"speaking of the placement of the wheels, which I agree with wholeheartedly, that they're set too far back and so there's no good feel for picking up and lowering the load - rather than being balanced you're putting a lot of effort into picking up and lowering the load smoothly... But even with that caveat, it works very well especially for the price. Great value for such a little truck, and incredibly portable. I purchased this for one end - to move my small wine fridge in my basement. It's full of about 40 bottles of juice and I didn't want to go emptying it out to relocate it. Worked great, collapses very small, extends well, and was surprisingly sturdy, which was my fear, that it would be a little flimsy. But it wasn't."
5,Just what we needed,"Nice compact hand truck, good for a lot of our needs. Salt bags for the water softner,recycle bins to the street. Folds to very small package for the car."
4,great product,"Light and easy to use. Easily folds up and collapses. Great product, but definitely for light use, as recommended by weight allowance."
2,Not really for heavy loads,"I used one to haul photo equipment on location. There are critical parts that are load bearing which are made of plastic. The cart lasted for three photo shoots. The design is OK and it is a decent quality but light duty item. Wheels are pretty undersized for the application. It is worth the price, but I can't recommend it for any serious hauling."
3,Small Cart,This is a nice hand cart for light loads on flat surfaces. I tried using this to move some medium weight boxes up the stairs to my car but found it flimsy & too small. The wheels are so small I had to jerk it up each stair. It was easier to carry the boxes individually. Good thing I didn't get rid of my standard size hand truck even though it takes up too much space in my hallway. I would not recommend this hand truck for people who need to seriously moves things up & down stairs.
4,Good product,It works great for moving things around. Very good value for this low price. Definitely a good product that I will buy again and I will recommend to my friends.
5,Just What You're Looking For,"Very simple: this thing is the greatest. Looks good, built well, designed right. Get two of them before someone figures out how good it is and ruins it. Cheerio!"
1,Not so good...no way this is up to 150 lb!,"There is no way that this is made for up to 150 lb, it's more like for up to 70 pounds. I use this at work and when I put one box with files in it, it feels like it has reached its max. When I put two boxes, it's so unstable and joint is so wiggly that I am afraid it's going to break at any second. I would not recommend this product."
2,Not for tall people. Not suitable for steps or rough surfaces,"While it's true that this hand truck can handle 150 lbs, it has two major flaws that made me regret buying it. First of all, the handle bar is too low for me. I'm not THAT tall (5'11''). But it's extremely inconvenient to move around if you have to either hold it with your fingertips, or bend over. Particularly if you actually reach the load limit.Second, because of its cute folding mechanism, the item is naturally pretty weak. Don't try to move a heavy load down the step in your entrance, for example. Sooner or later you are going to inflict structural damage on the hinges where it folds. Mine simply broke one day.To sum it up, this is only recommended as a backup hand truck for smaller jobs around the apartment or house."
3,Good Personal Hand Truck,"This is a good, solid utilitarian personal hand truck. It's a little heavy for my taste, but it makes up for it by being durable. I've used it for loads upwards of 100 lbs fairly reliably, but I have noticed that the bottom steel plate feels like it may be bending a bit when you try to load on 120 lbs or more. It feels fine once you get the load tilted onto your wheels, the bottom metal plate just seems to strain a bit when you're trying to load it. As such, I haven't tried it with anything heavier. I definitely would not try it with anything heavier than 150 lbs (its max recommended capacity)."
2,Not very durable,I am a musician and I carry my guitar amps with these.I have two of these. Both have the same problem - one of the wheel gets stuck and you can't unfold it. When you do it's crooked and there's nothing you can do about it. It wouldn't unfold on it's own either - you have to flip it out and hold it as you open the whole thing.I am also tall (6'5) and the handle is short for me.I've had these for about 18 months now and use them on daily basis. Not sure there's a better alternative so until they completely fall apart I am stuck with 2 half working hand trucks.
4,Great for Carrying a Load,This was a great find. We used it to carry books to a book sale and it carried the load great which spared our backs. The only fault I found was the handle could be a bit longer. By the end of the day our backs were tired from bending over.
3,Strong but not delicate,"Good product but the bottom panel should have been little bit longer.If it is long enough, it will be much easier to load different shapes of stuff."
5,durable for a foldable dolly,"I thought this would only last for a short time, but this hand truck is so durable. I put this through 2 moves. I moved small heavy book boxes up 2-3 flights of stairs with this thing. I use it to carry my laundry hamper and groceries,too."
5,Great little sidekick! Just dont forget it! =[,"Hi,I am here to purchase my second cart. This little thing has been my best friend whenever I need to transport boxes or heavy items around my small apartment or to my local UPS or USPS. Unfortunately I forgot it at the post office several weeks ago. I did not realize it until about a week later when I needed it again. So as the post office employee said, somebody became very happy that day. Here I am to purchase another one. =[I recommend purchasing extra bungee cords. When I purchased the cart it came with 2 bungees and 1 of them did not last very long."
4,A good cart for the money,"This is a good cart for the money (and with free shipping too). It's easy to use and is light weight and folds up easily. After finding carts that weren't really what I wanted for a whole lot more money, I felt very fortunate to find this one online. I had shopped at local stores and found nothing I liked for the right price.The only complaint I have is that the base could be a little longer front to back so things would stay on it better. I added a plastic crate held on with rubber hook straps, but a longer base would have helped more.Overall, a very good buy."
4,Take care of the wheels,"We bought two of these to move band equipment. They lasted a few years, but eventually the assembly that causes the wheels to rotate stops working and the wheels stop rotating out. It's easy enough to rotate them out by hand, but for those of you who have bought them and are looking to keep them working long-term, make sure you take care of that particular part and if you notice it starting to stick, use some oil/grease ASAP."
3,light duty,"if the pictures shows a case of water bottles and two paper boxes, i'm sure the boxes are empty! this cart does not do well with weight, but is usefull for bulky items like 3 light boxes. careful for those over 6 foot tall, you may hunch over as it does not extend enough for the vertically gifted."
5,Best investment I ever made!,"I live in Japan and have no need of a car because of the excellent public transportation here. However, sometimes I need to mail large packages back to the USA, or get them home from my APO on the Navy base. It is about a mile from my apartment to the post office on the base. I am a 62 year old woman who is not in the best of shape, yet I have transported loads of over 100lbs on this hand truck, for many blocks with no difficulty. It is sturdy, well balanced and the wheels never fail. The biggest test came when I moved from one apartment to another one block away and transported everything except the couch and refrigerator with this small hand truck. The collapsible design makes it so easy to carry when empty and to store in a small space. I can't recommend this product enough. You will not be disappointed!"
4,Handy & Functional,"Purchased this great little ""dolly"" to transport plastic tubs of books and materials; am very pleased. Is extremely easy to store, load, unload and folds back into its handy storage shape quickly and easily. Am finding it great for multiple home uses as well. Only tiny complaint I have is wishing that the handle extended more; find that I have to bend/reach down to pull or push it. Even knowing that, would still buy it."
3,magna cart hand truck,"The hand truck is worth the money paid, but not the sturdiest in the world.....if u need something heavy duty, youre going to have to pay more....."
3,Folding wheels are great ... and terrible,"The folding wheels are the best ... and worst feature. They make the unit much easier to carry and store. But they put the pivot point too far behind the load and that throws off the balance.Unintuitively, it works better with big loads than small; i.e., it is easier to move two boxes than just one! To balance short loads, you have to push the handle too far down (too close to horizontal) to be really comfortable. Fortunately, the handle is long, so it is not too awkward.Tall loads balance better. Moving one box is easier if you stand it on end than the more natural bottom."
1,Not going to work for heavy loads,"I got this cart as a gift and broke it on it's first day of use. I made sure that I never loaded more than about 100 lbs on it (it's rated for 150 lbs). The problem is not how much you can push with it, but getting it to tilt back with a heavy load without bending the rods in the back (which are very cheap and thin). Once the back is bent it will no longer collapse down. The back is also not very high, which means for a heavy load you have to tilt it back very far and lean down as you walk.I did appreciate the maneuverability of the wheels and how small it collapsed down. I think that if you are looking for something to use every once in a while to move small things, the Magna Cart will work fine, but if you want something that you can use on a regular basis for loads of more than 50 lbs, this will break in no time flat."
5,Saving my aching back!,"I haul sports and fitness equipment every day to various schools and day cares in order to teach kids classes. I love my business but the lifting has been killing my back. After a lot of research, I decided to buy this cart. I LOVE IT. It collapses so nice and small, and is very light weight. I can get everything on the cart quickly and easily. It is really saving me not having to carry all of my stuff. Thank you!"
4,Good value - get some bungee cords!,"I love this little hand truck for carrying boxes and supplies into the office and from the office to the classroom. I think $30 - $35 is a great value. I did see a cheaper model at Big Lots but seems like it did not have an adjustable handle. Will probably use this to move heavier things around the house when the time comes.Lessons learned:*You'll need bungee cords to keep the boxes or items from shifting*The handle doesn't always stay put when you push it in. Don't let a child play with it! My daughter was checking it out right after I opened the box, and the handle popped out without pushing the red release bar, and the bottom smashed to the floor right onto her toes. It wasn't bad but could have been worse."
3,Magna Hand Truck,"In general this is a quality product. It works as designed, appears quite strong and folds flat. On the negative side, it does not roll up steps easily. I brought this cart to move boxes up two sets of stairs to an attic. The stairs are uncarpeted hard wood with treads that overhang the steps by about 2"". The cart wheel were too small to roll up over the overhang. Instead the wheel would hit the underside of the overhang and stop. Also, the back of the cart would hit the front edge of the step causing scatches. I found a welded steel hand cart with 10"" pneumatic tires at a local farm store and it worked far better for this application."
4,"Fast, Easy to Use Two Wheeled Dolly","I ordered this dolly after reading the other reviews. It is VERY light weight, opens with a one handed snap, and touch of the toe, and is very easy to transport and store. It is obviously not meant to move really heavy objects, as it states, but is perfect for my husband and I to tote our ""extra comfy"" lawn chairs, cooler, and supplies to outdoor events and also makes shopping a pleasure at the city market, when I strap on a large milk crate to carry goods. It's the kind of two wheeler that can go with you, unlike others that are meant strictly for heavy duty jobs. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Nice cart - not great in a salty environment,I bought one of these several years ago and it is a nice hand truck. It folds up nicely and has a decent load capacity for its weight. However I was living on a boat at the time and salt air from the bay eventually (a couple of years) caused it to deteriorate. I still have the hand truck but it doesn't fold the way it used to.
4,Magna cart,"Magna Cart Personal Hand TruckThe hand truck is very compact and folds/unfolds easily. The fully extended handle doesn't feel like it would handle up to a 150 Lbs. but The maximum weight I have used it for is about 60 lbs. and it handles that just fine. The wheels are large enough to go over grass, gravel and somewhat uneven ground. I am satisfied with the product."
3,A bit weak,"This thing works OK, but don't expect it to be super sturdy. I don't think it'll hold up long with the stated max load. I wouldn't buy it if I had known it."
3,Needs bigger wheels,"I live in an apartment and need to haul weekly groceries for a family of 4, 200 yards across the quad and up one flight of stairs. Pros: Sturdy, folds easily, is compactCons: Needs bigger wheels - it could not even manage small cracks in the walkway. I thought I would be able to drag it up the stairs but since the wheels are smaller than the gap between the steps I cannot do this. I can do this on another cart I have but that unfortunately does not fold like this one."
5,One of the best purchases I've ever made,"This little hand cart has been a back saver for me!! I use it for carting anything that is big, bulky, awkward or too heavy to carry. It conveniently folds up to a very small size, so I keep it in the trunk of my car so it is always handy. I have used it more than a dozen times in just the last few weeks. I love it! I highly recommend it to everyone."
4,Does what it was designed to do,The only thing I would like is a slightly longer handle when fully extended. I would say this is an excellent value at the price I paid. ($35.00)
5,GREAT FOR TRAVELING AND TRADE SHOWS,"I love this little hand cart because it is lightweight, yet durable enough to handle the stuff that I need for outdoor tradeshow or festival events. It is very handy to have when you have to lug around stuff to set up. It is also very unassuming and takes up little space. I highly recommend this cart for those that need that type of light support when traveling with business presentation stuff."
4,Time killer,"I live in the second floor and have a bad back, this helps me in a big way. No need to go back and forth, not good on to much wait thought. I use it very often, very useful and price is just wright."
3,magna cart,"It's Okay, but the wheel system makes it difficult to balancer. you have to push down on the handle to keep it balanced, so the center of balance is off when loaded with a heavy load."
5,Phenominal,"I am a photographer with a lot of equipment to lug around. I was sceptical when I came across this hand cart online about it's claim to be so light weight and durable but I took a chance and I'm VERY glad I did. This hand cart lives up to it's advertising and much, much more !!! I highly recommend this product."
5,Magna Cart,I have to admit when I saw the price I was thinking it probably is not the best quality. I was plesantly surprised. Very sturdy and well made. And this is a great price too.
5,heavy duty for a light weight,I bought this for moving our daughter in and out of the dorm. It proved it might many times. It never wavered. I would recommend it
3,okay,"I wanted a replacement for a full size hand truck that was stowable. This isn't that. It is stronger than you would expect, but still quite what I wanted. It does stow nicely."
3,Great,"It works well for carying hevy items, and it has after a while of use stopped pulling the wheels out when I try to open it up, but other than that it is still working strong"
5,Great Cart!,"The Magna Cart Personal Hand Truck works very well for me. I haul boxes of paper and books and electronic equipment for my job. The wheels and the wide base or ""floor"" allow me to go over bumpy sidewalks, streets, or parking lots without tipping over, which was a problem I had with other carts. Folding up and unfolding this cart is extremely easy. You do not need a great deal of hand or arm strength. If you have physical limitations regarding bending, you can use your foot/toe to easily press the ""floor"" of the cart down to load or to press it into the flat mode for storing."
4,"Light, strong, portable and a good product !","Magna Cart Personal Hand TruckI purchased this Magna Cart for our personal use from Amazon.com. Its a strong, light and portable cart. Can fold it to a small size to carry anywhere. We use it to carry many things around our house hold, laundry, weekly grocery from the car to the house, shifting books from one room to another and many more things. Its a very useful and affordable product for every house hold.Malavi Dissanayake, Chicago03-03-2009"
4,"Useful, handy, strong and light tool.","It fits on the overhead bins of airplanes. Excellent for: traveling, gardening, business, work, etc. I was thinking in buying a wheeled garment bag, but now I am still using my spacious and old one, which was not wheeled."
1,It breaks very quickly,"We had three of these handtrucks at my work. All three broke within three months.There are two main problems, the first is the telescoping handle. This part broke on all three trucks. The second problem is the light duty linkage on the flip down tray. After about 1 week of using the product it is clear that this product is not meant to be used. The force that is needed to push the tray down is incredible.So for me, if I bought another of these I would expect it to last 3 to 6 weeks, then it would be broken and in need of replacement. I do not think that this product is worth buying, I know my purchase was a mistake."
3,Disappointed!,"It's a hand cart. It is much heavier than I expected. I live on the third floor and bought it to help me haul up groceries, etc. It is too heavy for that but I'm sure it will work just fine as a hand cart for light-weight items. I pulled the handle out but then I couldn't get it to shorten again. All in all, it was a bad idea."
5,One sweet little cart,"My Magna Cart arrived quickly via USPS. When I unpacked it, I was surprised at how sturdy it looks and yet also is very compact. From the cast aluminum foot to the auto extension of the wheels, everything seems to be made of highest quality. It's a well-designed hand truck that's more heavy duty than I expected. I know I'll enjoy using it. It's better than I expected."
4,Magna Hand Cart Review,"It appears to be exactly what we're going to need when we take a trip in a few weeks, and the price was certainly very reasonable. It folds as flat and small as the photo illustration we saw when we were shopping for a luggage cart, and it appears to be solid and sturdy. The only reason we haven't given it a five-star rating is that we can see we're likely to need to use bungee cords to be sure we don't tip our suitcases off the cart as we maneuver from the parking garage to the embarkation point for our cruise."
4,Sturdy!,I do in-home wine tastings so I needed this to transport my supplies. I had looked at hand carts at stores (inexpensive ones) and they were flimsy. This handcart was comparably priced and is much more substantial. I wish the wheels were a bit bigger; it may be easier to go up stairs if they were. Shipping was very fast! I think I had it within three days.
5,The Magna Cart Personal Hand Truck is just what I needed.,"I love this cart! It folds up to a compact, space saving size, it's easy to open it up. It is lightweight and easy for me to handle. I really like how the wheels fold in flat, too. I used the cart, loaded with plastic tubs full of craft fair items, for multiple trips in and out of a building."
4,"If you want to say that you've read Ayn Rand, this is the place to start","I heard a lot about Ayn Rand from my elders 20 years ago. At the time, I tried to read Fountainhead, but never could get into it. This past year, I happened to run into Anthem and bought it on my Kindle. This is the book I should have started with all those years ago. Rand's rant against the evils of unmitigated collectivism still plays well for those who live and work in broken communities where the status quo has taken on the character of revelation. Rand inspires rebellion against group think. Add some real critical thinking skills to Rand's simplistic vision and one has the potential for solid citizenship."
5,Every mind should know this book,"The genius of simplicity is in these words. If the meaning of freedom doesn't strike you after this short work, then perhaps some soul searching is in order. These pages scream TRUTH"
2,.,"Aside from the fact that this basic idea had appeared at least 2 times before Ayn Rand decided to take it up, Anthem is a rather boring book. It conveys certain aspects of her philosophy decently, I suppose, and is yet again a warning that we should be on guard lest we all become meaningless automatons at some point in the future -- but that's all. As fiction, it is generally dry. It was interesting enough to hold my attention through to the end, and you'll probably have a few things to think about upon finishing -- all well and good. But overall, it feels more like intellectual propaganda in the form of a dull little parable stolen from better authors, rather than a vital and enriching work of original literature."
5,Self,"Anthem is the point that uniqueness in life makes it the fruit of life itself. To forever know that we is a collection of ""I"" is,great learning gladly accepted from an author as versed on things as Rand."
1,Trite and cliche?,"A now garden-variety tale of a future world where identity is outlawed and lives are architected and administered by an authoritarian counsel. The story is an obvious reaction to the institutions which aim to bridle our actions and emotions. Escaping this world, the main character transcends this ""modernity"" and finds beauty and life on his own terms.""Our son will be raised as a man. He will be taught to say `I' and to bear the pride of it. He will be taught to walk straight and on his own two feet. He will be taught reverence for his own spirit.""Rand does a good job of keeping the story ""close to the metal"" -- minimalist -- leaving much room for imagination. However short and sweet, some will find it trite and now cliche, like myself."
1,Badly written and badly reasoned,"On a literary level this book was very badly written. My gosh it was written as if she was yelling at me. What poorly written propaganda. Her book read like Maoist or Soviet propaganda. It just was not artfully done. I've read quite a few dystopian novels and this has to be the worst. In fact, it one of the worst books I have ever read! Read We by Zamyatin, 1984 by Orwell, or Brave New World by Huxley instead.On a political level I also hated this book. Her notion of lassaiz faire capitalizm and individuality have helped lead to the excesses of the Wall Street bankers and multi-nationals."
1,An unrealistic propaganda machine,"In Anthem, Ayn Rand creates a society of collectivization that has no discernable basis for its power in the world. The book is a method of propagating atheism, self-worship, and anarchism."
1,Anthem,This book is horribly contrived and boring. Ayn Rand manages to take a potentially interesting topic and destroy the plot.
5,"""The Best"" is an Understatement","I've read the Fountainhead and that book was spectacular and recently I came across ""Anthem"" and now it has become my favorite book. If you enjoyed this book, check out ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, they both are similar but ""The Giver"" gives more detail and is based from a youth's out look. They are both two of my fav's and I'd like to share them with you all who have similar intrests to mine."
1,Put on the hip waders for this one,"This parable is pretty much the anti-Steinbeck. Where Steinbeck has marvelous prose and love for his characters, Rand has stilted language and remarkably two-dimensional portrayals. The central message appears to be that the magic of ""I"" is all anyone really needs. An appalling book whose near-fascist tendencies should have long ago consigned it to the junk-heap of historical curiousities. There's no real merit here at all."
2,Anthem- a book I only read because I had to,This book is a lot like the Giver. You know I didn't really like it. I just read it because I had to for a class. At least it was short and easy to read.
1,booh,this was aterrible book on so many levels. but my biggest beef with this book is that ayn rand's fictional writing is so heavily laiden with her rhetorical nonesense that she has failed to win audience before revealing the reason for the story. it's just too transparent for me.
1,4 star average? Really?????,Really??? Its 100 pages of a guy gloating about his amazing achievement: Finding someone else's invention and claiming it as his own.
3,Anthem review,"Although considered a literary classic, this work was produced at a time (the 1930's) when socialism and thought-control was apparently feared by thought leaders. Anthem is in the genre of 1984. Seems pretty dated thinking at this point."
1,An Unfair Review,"This is a completely unfair review to make. I'm not a Ayn Rand fan, and I usually try to avoid reviewing books about whose authors I am more or less ignorant and uninterested. That said--and all readers having been warned--this is one of the few books I have ever read in my life that I completely and utterly and absolutely loathed. If I ever had the slightest inclination to read The Fountainhead, this book squashed that interest to ant-like proportions. I found it narcissistic, chauvinistic (even by my relaxed ""Hey, patriarchy has some good points"" standards) and bovinely incompetent in its logic. The hero's solution to his anti-individualist society by creating an ""I'm the only individual that counts"" society (in other words, ANOTHER anti-individualist society) plumbs the depths of idiocy. I've been told that Ayn Rand did better than this, but I can't bring myself to find out.To play fair, other reviews are much more positive so keep reading if I've thoroughly annoyed you."
2,"This may have been groundbreaking 70 years ago, ...","but if an unknown author wrote this today it would be derided by everyone who read it (and that wouldn't be very many because it would never get published) as boring, simplistic, passe and irrelevent. Yeah, yeah, yeah, ... the evils of collectivism, the Borg, socialism is bad, individuality rocks, yadda yadda, been there, done that.The story itself is basic individual v. collective ending in a 10-page social/political diatribe by the author. The politics of it were no doubt relevent to a communist exile 70 years ago, but are pretty corny to a 21st century American.So, my review is not a knock on Ayn Rand. The story was probably new, exciting and relevent when she wrote it. But unless a reader has had their head in a hole for a long time I can't see how this book will make much of an impression."
3,Didactic and preachy,"Although it was well-written, ""Anthem"" is very preachy about individualism. Rand's background prejudiced her against any kind of state educational system as being entirely conformist. The mood in it is completely somber. This is NOT a ""feel-good"" read.Very dystopic."
3,good book,"anthem is a book that i was not happy when reading it , but it helped me in many things one of the most important things is because its vocabulary i knew many new words and when reading another book i feel i am reading it faster . I think that anthem is a useful book for advanced students and it will teach them many them and of course according to the teacher for me i had a great teacher that why i felt that i learned many things from that book ."
4,Great Ayn Rand starter book. Ayn Rand-Lite,"I'm embarrassed to admit I just found out about this book and read it for the first time recently.Anthem's contribution to the Ayn Rand philosophy is almost negligible compared to The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. But Anthem is short and accessible to the average reader. My gifted 10 year old read Anthem and understood it.This should be the first Ayn Rand book you read. If you like it, read The Fountainhead. Save Atlas Shrugged, her finest achievement, for last.Ayn Rand is the most important writer since Adam Smith. Her works are as timely now as when they were written. If they were required reading in high school and college ours would be much smarter (and more prosperous, and more free, etc.)"
4,Enjoyable,"Okay, forget for a moment that Ayn Rand's philosophy is very self-centered and really rather destructive. Despite popular opinion, you do NOT have to agree with her ideas to enjoy her novels! At least, not if you enjoy intellectual debate.Anyway, having said that... Anthem is my favorite Rand novel. It is a pleasure to read. However, I have to say that to see the same concept in a much better written, more enjoyable novel, pick up We by Yevgeny Zamyatin. If you've already read Anthem, read We anyway. It's just better. But Anthem is well worth reading at least once."
4,A superb introduction to Ayn Rand,"If you're unfamiliar with the works of Ayn Rand, 'Anthem' or 'The Fountainhead' are good starting points. Aspiring writers will find the 50th anniversary edition of 'Anthem,' which includes an earlier rendition with revisions in Rand's handwriting, quite a treat. I don't give the book 5 stars because the last chapter is a bit repetitive - intelligent readers will get her point long before she is finished stating it."
3,A good introduction to Rand,"If you are new to the works of Ayn Rand, I recommend reading Anthem first. It displays some of her philosophy, and is the most readable of her fictional works, mostly because of its brevity."
2,Anthem,"Rand, as always, takes the individual to the extreme. Takes what she thinks may happen to the extreme. She writes almost devoid of emotion."
3,Anthem,"Interesting, leading one to believe the goal of life is self, therefore, it has strong ties to achieving the American dream"
3,Ok,"I thought this book was pretty interesting. Although, during the beginning, when the author used we instead of i, it was confusing a little."
3,This book put me to sleep,This story had good intentions but the whole idea presented didnt go over well with me. I feel that AYN RAND is a wonderful yet disturbed writer that needs to open her eyes to the real world and put away her anger and logic. if she expects anyone to fully understand her work she she should include a photo of the main character in each book. I feel this would help all the young readers out there to realize her talent and skills.
3,"This book is way before its time, yet it drags on so much...","This book drags on so much that by the time it gets interesting, you're already asleep. If you can stay up long enough to finish it, it could really open your eyes to the possibilities. If you've got some time, this is the book for you."
3,Individualism !!! Could have been less harsh .,"Well, i've read all reviews. Some are pretty harsh and some are very sweet. Personally I feel the book is good for an hour of brainstorming on a new stream of thought. But it could have been a little softer. The picture is too gloomy and the language is too straight. A bit change in language and increase of length would put some colour to the book. But as far as the idea is concerned there is no one who could have written something that rings a bell of realisation into every thinker on introspection of how much is a man permitted to have a mind of his own. A good book, and a must for all, it's just a 2 hour you're spending, so what the hell.. go ahead, it's worth much more !"
3,Anthem is a good book.,"I think that Anthem was a good book because it was unlike most books I have read in the past. I liked the way the author showed the progress of Equality 7-2521's thoughts and independence throughout the story. In the beginning, he merely thought of how he wished to be more than a street sweeper, but then he acted on his instincts. He believed that he had potential, and could contribute positively to The Council of Scholars, but it turned out that they did not want his input at all. I also liked how Equality 7-2521 told of his future plans, and I think he will end up being the founder of a new nation once he gets enough support from his fellow people. However, in the end of the book when we learn that the secret word is ""Ego"" i don't think that it was a good one to have. it should have been ""I"" because i think that ego is very much related to the word ""I"", but a little more to the point."
2,There is no I in team...,"I get it. In a future where the I has destroyed the world, We is the way to assimilate and ensure flat, even, consistent survival.But having not read the details of the book was a mistake for me, I think. I was about 60% done with this book and said to my husband, ""I think this book is about robots"" :). I could understand taking away the my, I, and other possessive pronouns... but it was the names that gave it the robotic feel. It wasn't until I got to the ""Mating"" thing that I doubted my theory. Even then, I wasn't sure I was wrong.The book was a quick enough read, and I'm not disappointed I read it, but it just wasn't that good of a book."
3,Relevant For Many,"This does not represent great literature but, for those who think socialism is the answer for society (or who aren't sure), it serves as a warning of where socialism ultimately leads in the worst-case scenario and for everyone else, it is a celebration and reminder of the importance of individualism. I personally don't agree that individualism alone is the end-all, but the book must be put into the context of Ayn Rand's personal experience and the time in which it was written. Yes, there are large plot holes but it is not intended to be an air-tight logical argument but rather, as the title implies, a celebration of the ego. Also, Rand herself described it as a poem.I read this in preparation for reading Rand's novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. I now know (or have some idea) where she stood on the subject and will use that understanding to enhance my experience of the two novels."
1,"Boring, derivative, wrong-headed.","Her escape from the Soviet Union left Miss Rand with the notion that yes, the Communists were right: materialism is all. She just disagreed with them about how to cut the pie. Her vision is as dreary as theirs. That said, there remains no reason to read this trite book in the vein of _Brave New World_, for its prose is lame and its storyline is predictable. If you're a Christian (even a Protestant or Roman Catholic), you'll want to steer clear of this; if you're a materialist, you'll be insulted. Who likes this stuff?"
1,This was really bad...,"Always say something positive first...hmm...let's see...well, it was short. Really short, 105 pages. Other then that, I hated it. It had no plot, no story, no characters. the main character was totally uneduring, flat as a board. She can't write at all. Anyone wanting to read this should try 1984, a true masterpiece, or The Giver, along the same lines and nice as well."
3,The bible of selfishness,"This book is a poem about the greatness of man and what it means to be human. Unfortunately, it is also an ode to selfishness. This book, I think, is a good example of the wealth of possibilities inherent in Rand's philosophy, but which Rand herself, in her attempts to justify continuing her adolescent attitude of selfishness and disdain for others, was unable to bring to the fore and to develop fully. Just as her philosophy would have been a great philosophy had she eventually outgrown this selfishness, this book would have been a great book had it not taken a nearly satanic turn. Rand, in her delusion, rather than extolling the greatness of man as mankind, extols instead the individual, man in the singular. Her language throughout is pervaded with biblical allusion and metaphor and a constant use of the word ""sacred"" and its synonyms. Unfortunately, however, all of this is employed in order to make a virtue -- even a holy duty -- of selfishness and of the first sin: pride."
1,0 stars is more like it...,"This book is pathetic. The ideas presented are repeated many more times than necessary. Rand took a treatise on government and society, dressed it up in (bad) prose, and presented it as a novel. There are much better dystopian novels: Brave New World, We, etc. The writing is bland and didactic. Save your money."
5,I will it!,"I thought this book was amazing. It was a very fast read, and I ended u doing a book report on it. I highly suggest this book, and the best line is ""I will it"""
4,A Classic,A good primer to learning the writing style of the awesome Ayn Rand. A very short and innovative look at a post-apocalyptic future
5,Awe inspiring,All I can say is that this book is amazing. Never have a read such a touching masterpiece. The power of the individual is endless.
2,One of her books I could not get through,Just such hard reading. I've read several of her other books and really enjoyed them. This is one I would not recommend.
5,Individuals Who Don't Like this Book are Parasites,"It's a short book, read it yourself and see what you think"
3,It's been done better..,"I must agree with another review I saw for the book. I would much rather have heard about his life afterward; although the entire book was interesting (although I disagree with the concept of objectivism) it would've been much better, had see elaborated more towards the end. And, it could have been better written. Ayn Rand was more of a philosopher, and less of a descriptive writer."
4,It is one of the best books I have read all year!,"This book was very interesting. This book was assingned to us in my English class. I am a freshman in high school,but it has been one of the teacher has given us to read all year. I have to write a tone paper over this book so who ever is writing a review over this book, HELP ME!"
5,I only give this book 5 stars because I can't give it 100,"In response to Mr. Topp's remarks I have nothing to say except that he is an idiot who is so stupid that he couldn't recognize genius if he stepped on it. Oh wait... that's what he did in his review. Ayn Rand is the most brilliant writer ever. Her outstanding prose conveys her message so it is as clear as day. While this book may not be as good as AS or The Fountainhead, it certainly deserves 5 stars. I recommend this book to any rational and/or intelligent person who will put Mrs. Rand's ideals to good use."
4,a celebration of individuality,"i'll admit that miss rand's writing style isn't the most captivating, in fact, i'd say she isn't very good. but it's the philosophy behind the story that makes it so great. she shows us that even though we need to become one people, we must also remember who we are as an individual. even if this wasn't such a quick read, i'd recommend it to everyone."
4,My mind kept picturing Jonas from _The Giver_ by Lois Lowry,"As a children's librarian I kept picturing Jonas the main character from Lois Lowry's Newbery Award winning book _The Giver_. (highly rec'd)I was a bit confused as I started the book, but finally everthing clicked and fell into place. Certainly I don't want to give away the story-line, but certainly worth the 75-90 minutes it will take you to read, and like the review below states, a good introduction to Ayn Rand."
5,A great piece of work,"This is really a great book. I read it when I was 14 and again about two weeks ago(21 now). I forgot how good it was. Another book most of you will love is ""The Giver"" by Lowis Lawry, it is very good and has similar meanings."
5,For those who think ...,"This is a great book for anyone with a mind AND the ability to use it! Truth is beauty and this book is both. I'd recommend ""For the New Intellectuals"" next - another short, direct book"
4,Great primer if you are looking to read more Rand.,This is actually a pretty quick read and compared to her other work it's pretty strait forward. It's perfect for people who want to start reading Rand but don't want to jump feet first into Atlas Shrugged. It's also good for younger readers.
4,Anthem,"Hard to believe this book was written in 1930's! If you liked Hunger Games trilogy and the Allie Condi Matched trilogy, read this.....just because it is the post-apocolyptic theme."
3,Interesting proposal of solid philosophy; not indispensable,"There is nothing inherently wrong with this book. It clearly states her philosophy--a solid, logical one to which I owe nothing but respect--and the writing is, as Rand's prose usually is, uninspiring but efficient. Unfortunately, however, Anthem has little signifigance other than that it came before Rand's two larger novels. To learn about Objectivism, her outright philsophy, The Virtue of Selfishness, for example, is the source. For dramatizations, look to The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged. For early Soviet distopian works, Zamyatin's WE is contextually more interesting (and, perhaps, watered down) Novel or poem, fiction or manifesto, Anthem is neccessary reading only for those who haven't the time to trudge through a bigger book or those looking to complete Rand's corpus."
1,Chopped,"This Kindle version of Anthem is incomplete. It leaves out the most important part of the opening chapter -- the words cut in the marble:""We are one in all and all in one.There are no men but only the great WE,One, indivisible and forever.""Without these words, the story packs zero meaning. This fatal flaw kills this story. Seek another e-copy elsewhere."
3,A quick dystopian read.,"If you're looking for a classic book that is also a quick read, Anthem is a great choice, I blew threw it in two sittings. I'm not sure that I'd say I enjoyed this book, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it either. It's an interesting concept, with an interesting writing style - but that writing style borders on tedious and dystopian novels at this point are almost a dime a dozen. Still, I'm glad to finally be able to say I've read this book."
2,philosophy in a scant literary outfit,"Ayn Rand is so concerned about espousing her outlandishly individualistic philosophy that she seems to neglect some of the basic tenants of storytelling (plot, character development, etc.) I would have been happier with this little volume is Ms. Rand had dispensed with the pretense of story and simply allowed me to be convinced by the inherent weight of her ideals."
2,"So, yeah...","A friend of mine demanded I read something by Ayn Rand. I looked and they were written in like the early-ish 1900s. This was the shortest one, so I decided why not. Wow. This was just weird and bad and bizarre. It was way too short for the story. And I think it could have been great. The concept was exceptionally well thought out, but it wasn't executed well. The story was too deep, yet too simplistic all at once. It was rushed, yet too slow. I'm not sure if my review makes any sense, but I think had it been done today with a really good editor, it would have been more my style. I get it was ahead of it's time and probably controversial back in the 1930s, so I'm giving it two stars for that, but I think so much more could have been done with it."
1,They sure like this book in Caracas,"Wow! NINE reviews from Caracas, Venezuela, all submitted on the same day - most of them with hotmail addresses, a couple with no addresses at all, and ONE from an AOL account. Nothing fishy *there*.Say, gosh, this must be one heck of a darn good book! Guess I'll get a copy and reread it even though I thought it was a stupid piece of kludgy, heavy-handed melodrama the first time I read it! Maybe it's not too late to fish my old copy out of the trash!"
1,I agree with Melissa.,"I read this book for school. It was interesting at first but it ended up being...well...stupid. A little prideful, aren't we? Anyone who seriously enjoyed this ought to get a hobby. Boring, boring, boring. Read Les Miserables instead. It may be long, but at least it's interesting."
1,Wrong on both counts!,"I disagree with the reviewer below on both counts. Rand obviously didn't ""coppy"" this book from Rush's album 2112, and it's a stupid book anyway."
1,Read WE instead,"This slender book (maybe emaciated would be a better word) is a meager re-hash of a few of the ideas that Evgeny Zamiyatin used -- brilliantly, incisively, and with far more vinegar and fire in his writing -- in his classic WE, which predates both BRAVE NEW WORLD and 1984. If you've already read ANTHEM, dig up WE and read that. For all of her vest-pocket nattering, Rand didn't have a tenth of the genuine creative power of Zamiyatin -- or his more genuine philosophic sense. ANTHEM is a bloodless, flabby little parable that gets blown clean out of the mind by the sinister power of WE.Zamiyatin died in exile -- he left the country rather than continue to endure censorship -- with his works censored by the Russian state apparatus and his legacy all but forgotten. Rand went on to found her own mini-empire of publishing and lecturing. Knowing Rand's thinking, she probably would have blamed him for it all."
2,Not Compelling,"This book is neither compelling, nor interesting. It is a short story designed to make a case for Rand's egoistic philosophy, but it reads more like propaganda than philosophical fiction. A better representation of her philosophy can be found in her longer works, or perhaps through reading her wikipedia article.The story is science fiction after a fashion - a world that has forgotten all its technology after descending into a new dark age with the death of individualism, seeks to prevent any individuality in the people that now occupy it. Others have written this story much better - perhaps missing the egoist angle - but that is really Rand's import into the story in any case.This storyline is better carried out in H M Hoover's ""This Time of Darkness"". That book is the story Rand should have written here.In her defense, this book was written many years ago, and before much of the later science fiction work we now have - but it is not a work that stands the test of time, unfortunately."
4,"Beautiful, although quite short","A beautiful book, although, as the name implies, I felt it was a bit short. I would have enjoyed hearing about the society that Equality 7-2521 lived in in with more eloquent and descriptive writing such as how the latter part of the book was written, but overall I felt that it was a great book, althoug it took me some time to get into with the slow beginning."
5,in a word - AMAZING!,"Ayn Rand proves to be most eloquent in this ""non-book"" about egoism and the triumph of the individual. Reading the first chapter leaves the reader a little confused but quickly becoming enthralled. I tell everyone who asks about Ayn Rand's writing style to check this one out before committing to her heavier pieces (Atlas Shrugged or Fountainhead). This to me was an introduction, a little taste, of what Rand has to offer her readers."
3,Individualism,A good introduction to Ayn Rand. The biographical information informs you of why she chooses individualism over collectivism. The story is short so very readable without having to get into a lot of character development while at the same time giving enough subject development. I read this one to see if I wanted to read Atlas Shrugged.
5,QUICK SHIP AND GREAT PRICE,"This was on my 9th grade son's reading list, so I was happy to find all of them on Amazon at a great price and I received really fast!"
2,Significant Work Burdened by the Narrator,"The audiobook narrated by Christopher Lane is tough to listen to, even as brief as the book is (3 CDs). If he was trying to sound monotonous and with an unpleasant edge to his voice, he succeeded magnificently. He reminded me very much of an audiobook version of Catch-22 that I tried to listen to 5 or 6 years ago but had to stop because the narration of that book was completely annoying. I don't know whether this is the same person, but I would recommend reading the printed book in any case."
4,Essential Reading,"Set in a dark, collectivist future, one man must discover the word ""I"" before he can find freedom. This short story lays out some of the basics of Ayn Rand's protest against collectivism in a format that is accessible to teenagers and adults alike. The last two chapters are really the ""anthem"" of the book, and I have gone back to read them again several times."
3,Great book,I really like this book but have a different opinion of the author. Ayn Rand is too extreme with individualism this I feel is my only fault in this book. Also Rand seems too overconfident in her last statement with ego which seems a bit strange in the end.
5,Rand is a great author,"This is a short story, very easy to read, with a powerful message. A cross between Logon's Run and Brave New World. Highly recommend."
4,A warning of our slide,Ayn Rand examines 'collectivism' from a slightly different perspective. The willingness of mankind to submit to slavery to the collective is juxtaposed to the native satisfaction of what the individual brings to life; calling it a sacred thing. It was a fresh face on a classic theme.
1,Brave New World written by a high school sophomore,"This is a story about a world of automatons which was the result of some unexplained disaster to the human race. Our hero finds himself and a female companion and they escape into an individualist nirvana, taking a newly rediscovered scientific marvel with him. While the concept of idiviualism and anti-centralized control is classic Rand, this is so ham-handed as to be comical."
5,"in a word: freedom (and in this case, it is for free)","this was my introduction to rand, and it's a great little story. basically, it's one person's struggle for freedom against a planned or forced society where a group of elders decide everything. fans of the canadian rock band rush will be interested to note that this was the inspiration for 2112, which is essentially the same story, but moved to the 22nd century and to another planet. in my opinion, this is a must read for anyone, and if you have a kindle or a reader for your computer, you can't beat it being free."
4,"Unique, yet scary","This title actually deserves 4.5 stars, but you can't put that. This book takes place in a time where individualism has been demolished: you cannot make your own decisions, you cannot create anything on your own, or that isn't approved, and you can't speak out if you find something unfair. Our hero, Equality 7-2521, watches someone burned at a stake for discovering an unknown, 'evil' word, when he is but a child. This inspires him. He wants to know EVERYTHING, but is sentenced to be a street-sweeper forever. This is his story of finding himself, and his plan to save his world. At first, this book is confusing and seemingly pointless.After a few days of meditating on it, though, you realize how much this book makes you think,and how fantastic it really is."
4,First book I've read that REALLY had something to say.,"At first I picked up this book with the intent of entering the anual essay contest. I thought, ""Looks short and simple."" But the truth is that this book is anything BUT simplistic. The style was only confusing for the first page, but after that first page the style was what really made the book what it is. Some of the reviews I read stated that the book is simplistic and childish in form. I feel sorry for those people because they obviously missed the point of the book."
5,A book that will expand your thoughts about the future.,"Anthem, a book that will expand not only your thoughts about the future but it will also expand your imagination. This is the story of a man who lives in the near future, the story of Equality, and his escape from this society. This is a thought provoking. It gives you a view of the future that you could never imagine or think about. This book is recommended for non-believers of the future and for believers. It is great book to read."
3,Not Rand's best,This novel is very simple and far fetched. This is Rand's attack on conformity and communism/socialism. The problem she is speaking out against is so exaggerated in the book that it is almost impossible to take Rand seriously. This one shouldn't be red past middle school unless you are a die-hard objectivist and must read Rand's entire ouvre.
3,Meh,"This is Ayn Rand doing what Ayn Rand does best: setting up a bunch of paper tigers, then knocking them over with a few well-aimed rhetorical hits. In her classic ""Let's rehash all the problems with Soviet collectivism"" style, she posits a future in which everything is grey and dull, where sex has been reduced to animalistic reproduction and work has been reduced to drudgery. Into this world strides the classic Randian hero who learns the higher moral value of embracing his most basely selfish urges. As with most Rand heroes, he ultimately becomes an incredibly self-centered prick.On the bright side, this book accomplishes in a few dozen pages what Atlas Shrugged does in a few hundred. So, if you want the Rand experience without spending a couple of weeks buried in her world, this is the most efficient delivery system."
4,Very interesting,"Although I couldn't disagree with Ayn Rand's philosophy more her novels are always complex,but worth it.In Anthem the idea of an almost ""Big Brother""ish world is very well portrayed.This is one of her shorter novels and is a good way to enter the world of Ayn Rand."
4,A book which depicts our society in a regressed future,"Anthem deals with the issue of communism and socialism. How this forms of goverments are controlling our personnel lifes and descions more and more. Its setting is in the futur but unlike most futuristic novels were technoolgy has marvelously avanced , the futur has regressed. Why because of communism and socialism. The book talks about our school our lifes and how we are losing our imgination and problem solviing skills because our goverments provide for us we don't nesecarilly have to succeed."
5,A snapshot of the anti-indivualists ideal society,"In a short and easy to read story Rand provides the reader with a first person view of the ultimate anti-individual society - one in which identification with self is barred.Because the book is written as if by the hand of the hero, the reader gets no insight into how such a society could have come about. For this, read Atlas Shrugged by the same author wich explains exactly how it can be done in 1000 pages. What the reader does get is to share in the pleasure of the heroes 'journals' recording his escape to freedom.A great thought provoker for young and old alike."
3,A provocative book,"I would recomend this book to anyone that likes to read about anything that is thought-provoking. Personally I dont like books that require a lot of thought to fully understand it. Its basically about a society thats collectivistic, the word ""I"" doesnt exist so every one talks of ""we"" and ""us"", the society has a stong society that is communistic. Its interesting."
1,Not by a long-shot,This laughably simplistic and pretentious book is predictably loved by Rand fans and scorned by everyone else. Fightened by repression? Read Orwell
2,My thoughts,"The philosophies of Ayn Rand are the weakest defenses of capitalism I have ever read. Her insistence on the right of every man to his own mind and body are easily flipped against her. Under capitalism, all working people are tools. Their work(which takes up most of their life, and therefore their mind and body), is only a means to advance the profits of their employers. Her insistence on the domination of reason, fails to recognize the inherent prejudices and flaws of Socratic ""reason.""Her faith in reason is devastated in the works of Sigmund freud and Frederich Nietzche. Her and her followers merely are repelled by the perversions of collectivism in Russia and are drawn to the romantic heroes of her work"
1,"ayn rand is an awful, awful writer","The fact that Ayn Rand is so widely respected appalls me, and chills me the very marrow of my bones. Her philosophy is basically a rehashing of older ideas that she has distilled in such a way that high school students can understand them. She says nothing new about individuality or the self, and is fit only as a companion to more complicated works by perhaps Lacan and Foucault. In addition to her juvenile philosophies, she is a horrible writer. The writing in Anthem could have been done by a 12-year-old, and all of the metaphors are trite and obvious. I almost vomited in disgust when the main male character named himself ""Prometheus."" So, he's bearing forbidden knowledge of the self, hoping to impart it on the rest of us, much like Prometheus who stole the forbidden fire (a symbol of knowledge) from the heavens. Spare me. This is so obvious and stupid. It pains me that people have actually rated this book higher than novels written by James Joyce."
1,A fascinating look into the mind of fascism and nazism,"This book shows clearly the inner mental workings of extreme right-wing fascist Nazi-esque philosophy. By elevating the ego and selfish interests above all else, it prevents anyone from cooperating together on a common cause -- the perfect society to be ruled by an iron-fisted ""benevolent"" fascist dictatorship, an idea which Ayn Rand quite openly embraced. It's no surprise that her works, including Anthem, Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, are extremely popular in militia/survivalist/skinhead/white supremacy circles, embraced as much as ""The Turner Diaries"" and other similar works."
2,"Come on, it's Ayn Rand","The lack of individuality in the depicted society makes for a dull story told with a limited vocabulary, and Ayn Rand's ridiculous, individualistic, self-indulgent philosophy makes the ending of the book not even worth the short 66 page read."
1,this seller is a cheat,"I bought a copy of Ayn Rand's ""Anthem"" from this seller. My order was for a new book but I received a used one. Had it been in relatively good condition I wouldn't have complained. Morever, about 150 pges (ove half of the whole book) were full of ink marks. When I say inc marks, don't expect just spots, sentences are deliberately blotted out so as you would not be able to read them. Some pages, some body have scriblled in his own paragraph, after wiping out the original content of the author.If half of the content is purposely marked up on to obscure its eligibilty, and if the other half is is filled up some lunatic's stupid scriblings then what is left to read?Almost nothing, the ""book"" is usless. If I want to return it it will cost me more than to buy a new copy. so I will simply throw it away.This seller is a cheat, don't buy anything from her/him."
3,read my review!!,"Okay, straight to my thoughts, no summary. As far as the storyline goes, the book is alright. The reading level is not too hard, and it's pretty easy to understand. The only confusing part is the ""we"" and stuff. The author Ayn Rand is mysterious writer. I do not like how she has written this book. From what I understand, she was raised in the Russian communist society. The reason I dislike this book so, is because of how she tries so hard (or so it seems) to make this sound like a real society. It is not possible, and frankly, I do not believe that the American society is like the one described in this book whatsoever. The bases of which America was first founded on was freedom, which is totally opposite from the communist rule in this book. Overall the book is okay, but as a strong Christian, I do not believe in the ideas it outputs. Read it is fine, give your own opinions!"
2,I disagree,"I guess it's OK, but I don't really agree with her ideas. I definitely preferred Animal Farm."
2,This book seemed rather simplistic and childlike.,"I can not entirely understand the concept of this book. I believe it is more the concept of this society that exists without individuality that confuses me rather than the books wording. I think the society that is so different from our own, that is preventing me from grasping the entire theory, ""all people are one"". However confusing this book appears to be, it was still incredibly predictable. You know what is going to happen after you have read the first chapter, especially the ending. I also found the character's quick changes in perspective of life, completely incomprehensive. They are unable to find the middle between total selflessness and complete selfishness. These are in desperate need to find the middle because of the drastic difference between the two. The characters have a rather childlike mindset. This annoys me to no end. I can not seem to understand why a writer of such talent, would choose to write this book, in the form she did."
3,The easiest Rand book to finish,"Ayn Rand's books have always been like auto wrecks on the freeway for me. I know that I shouldn't slow down to look, but I do. I've read ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"" and have left both disgusted with her absolute hatred towards mankind. The only people she seems to like are the ones she made up in her books, and even then, only a few of them. This short story stands as Rand's only good book. It's not great, but it's good. I actually liked the main character, and in very small doses, her philosophy goes down easy."
2,Not the Student Edition,"Although the book is in fine condition, this is NOT the student edition. It is a large copy that contains several different versions of the book. Ordinarily I would have appreciated this, but I needed to turn the student copy into my teacher. If you lost this book for L.A, and need to turn in the exact copy, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I eventually bought the Amazon Copy, which was fantastic."
5,Anthem,I have read Atlas Shrugged and wanted to read more of Ayn Rand's work. Anthem is a quick read but will give you a good idea about the basic premise of Rand's philosophy.
3,anthem,this book is very interesting. for the author to write this so many yrs ago they had forsight. good book. once you get into it. its a great sci fi
2,Not Ayn Rand's Best,"Ayn Rand is considered one of modern America's better authors. Acquired taste or high school/college reading assignment, most of us first experienced this writer as the latter. Anthem is an early work and it is very apparent in this novella. I found it difficult to finish, and it's only a little better than 60 pages. Simply put, I did not enjoy this book and I wouldn't advise it as an introduction to the author's other works."
3,Heavy-handed melodrama,"I originally read this because of the Rush album (2112) in the early '80's. I wanted to read the work that influenced the album and I really enjoyed her work a great deal at the time. In fact, I probably enjoyed it more than the Rush album. However, her story didn't age well for me and I'm not the impressionable high school kid anymore.Rand's basic philosophy behind the work is frustrating to me now. As a christian, I certainly believe she had the right to believe what she wanted as I have the right to disagree with the logical conclusion of her philosophy. I gave it 3 stars simply for the concept."
4,Better if not an assignment,This book is a treatise on induvidualism. It reminds me of the historic conflict with science and church pertaining to cosmology. I first read this book as a high school reading assignment 11 years ago. It can easily be digested in one sitting. Worth reading. As are most of Ayn Rand's works.
2,Sheeesh !!,"This story is not even up to the quality (and writing level) of the Science Fiction being written contemporaneously. It was a good idea run amok. I would refer it to no one, especially not to a serious reader of early sci-fi. I can't remember specifics, but there are a lot of clearly impossibloe projections.Les"
3,anthem,"It was based on a one world theme, everyone working for the good of everyone else, where people where not much more then drones, serving no purpose. It was an easy read, but the story left me feeling empty. The hero of the story breaks away from the pack but I didn't feel like he was really going anywhere either. I know that this was the first book Ayn Rand wrote, and I still want to read Atlas Shrugged."
4,Interesting read,"A very thought-provoking little book on a collectivist society. Not nearly the magnitude of Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead, but a very interesting concept, as with all of Ayn Rand's books."
4,"Great, fast read","This is an awesome book, somewhat along the lines of 1984. I really enjoyed reading the story, and thinking about true it could become. I would have given 5 stars, but I tend to like books a little longer so the characters can be developed a bit more. However, given the story line here, I can understand how the length was appropriate in the authors view."
3,Just a comment on an earlier review,"About the copy of Rush 2112. It's actually like this: Neil Peart states that Anthem inspired him to write 2112. So the ""original"" is Ayn Rand's Anthem."
3,Huh?,"Huh? As with Atlas Shrugged, the story made me wonder how and why Ayn Rand achieved such fame.Anthem is a moderately interesting tale lacking a satisfying beginning, middle, and end. It is marked by some literary contrivances which IMO insult the intelligence of the reader. If those contrivances had a payoff, it would be forgivable, but ""I"" and ""ego"" are not much of a payoff.Read it if you have nothing else to do."
4,A classic Ayn Rand tale,"Atlus Shrugged still remains one of my top three all-time books, and has been since the 15 years since I first read it, so it was about time that I finally picked up (well, downloaded onto my kindle) and read Anthem.It's classic Ayn Rand, though I feel the short amount of time she had to tell the story exaggerates her viewpoint somewhat, and the last page left me curious because I did not think that the 'sacred word' is what she was leading up to.Taken literally I feel like the book is extreme, but with a grain of salt gives a taste of the lessons her classic bring home so well."
4,Includes Author's Foreword from April 1946,"The ""twin towers"" Kindle edition (unknown publisher) is very well presented. A nice touch is inclusion of the Author's Foreword from April, 1946. It lacks a table of contents."
2,A Cliche Tale,"I've read or seen this before, the individual standing up to ""the system"" in a post-apocalyptic world. I read it because of the buzz surrounding Rand because of Paul Ryan. I don't mean to make a political statement, but, if this is what influences the Congressman, I have my doubts about him."
1,"Slow, dull, and I think it deserves 0 stars","To sum it up nicely, this book sucked. It had an OK concept, but the writing was boring, too intelectual, and long winded. Some phrases were powerful, but many of her sentences didn't hit me the way TALENTED writers, like Jane Yolen write. This book ANTHEM made no sense, and the way Ayn Rand used the ""We"" and the ""They"" confused me. As being an Advanced English ninth grader, I think I know what books are good, and what good writing is, and this is not it."
1,Ayn Rand's Anthem,"Anthem reflects the emotional outlook of a small child. sytematized by an adolescent, narrated somewhat eloquently. by a thirty-something. If Alan Greenspan is really a disciple of Ayn Rand it's no wonder he helped drive our economy into a ditch. When it comes to fiction or drama I'm something of a whore. I'll suspend my disbelief for just about anything. This tendency not withstanding I found it difficult to believe that a society whose technealogy had degenerated te to that of around 4000 B.C.E. was able to maintain a 20th century level of social organization."
1,Hateful,"As usual, Ms Rand is so worried about her philosophy of greed that she sacrifices her credibility as a writer. We should be happy that the president is illiterate, as he would be fueled by this message were he to read it. All one needs to know about Ayn Rand is that she does not believe that people have the capacity for selflessness."
1,ANTHEM - PAPER BACK,The print is not large enough for those over 50 years of age. Otherwise the book is great and look forward to reading more of her work.
2,Typical Ayn Rand...,"I bought this book to assist my nephew with a school project and I found it to be very typical to her other writings. I know people laud her for her visionary views on anti-communism/socialism, but personally, I find it banal. If one is looking to sway someone towards either democracy, or the idolism of the ego (self), then one may find it enjoyable. I find her ideas commonplace and would give it a Homer Simpson ""Doh!"" if I could. Her work could be relevant in these times of extreme right- and left-wing politics, warning of the dangers of being too one-sided, but again, common sense should dictate that in the first place. I'm sorry, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.The Kindle edition was a good edition of this book, there were few glitches or errors and for the price, you can't beat it."
3,who inspired whom?,"When I saw a play based on By the Waters of Babylon by Stephen Vincent Benet, I was struck by how similar it seemed to Anthem by Ayn Rand. Benet's work was published in 1937. Rand's in 1938."
3,"Simple: not great, not bad.",'Anthem' is a very easy read and can be done in an hour. However its simplicity made the storyline very predictable. I recommend this book toward philosophical/religious people. The ending wasn't that great but the theme is a very interesting topic that can be easily discussed with others.
4,Too Short!!!!,"Great book in the same vein as 1984, only problem is it can be knocked back in two hours tops! leaves you feeling like you only had a sandwich for thanksgiving dinner."
4,Good Introduction to Ayn Rand's Ideas,"ANTHEM is a very short novel written by Ayn Rand in 1938. It deals with a dystopian future where individualism is banned and the collective reigns supreme.I enjoyed reading ANTHEM. It serves as a good introduction to Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy. You should keep in mind, however, the story itself is only about eighty-five pages long. I finished the book in about ninety minutes.Half of the mass-market paperback edition consists of the entire British manuscript of ANTHEM, with Ayn Rand's handwritten editorial changes for the American edition. Although some people might find this material interesting, I found it to be a waste of space. Nearly all the edits are technical in nature, designed to tighten the writing style and nothing more. I learned nothing new from it.ANTHEM is worth reading, but I'm not a big fan of this particular edition. Why not combine ANTHEM with a set of essays dealing with Rand's philosophy? That would make more sense to me."
5,Individualism,"I wish I could require my students to read this book. It is an antithesis of socialism, communism and marxism. This is what it means to be an American and individual ruggedness and a yearning to be free. With the Statist slowly eroding through their soft tyranny for the better of the people this is the antidote. This is the spark to drive reassertion of what it means to be an American."
5,Hits Hard at Home,"Rand has created a masterpiece. ""Anthem"" a novella centered around the theme of individualism will hit you much like other dystopian classics would. A must read, at least once."
3,the worst of the author,"i'm a big fan on ayn Rand's book but this is, by far, the less interesting, probably because the book is short and easily comparable with 1984, brave new world and so on."
4,classic dystopian novel,"This is an interesting book, though I'm not sure we could call it a full novel, more of a novella at just over 100 pages. It's the near future and the individual has been swallowed by the collective. It's a utopian/dystopian novel in the family of Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World. It's a decent enough story, though you can tell it is an early work with the simplistic style of writing (though Rand was new to the English language when she wrote it). The only real problem with the book is that it gets a little 'philosophical' and preachy, at times to the detriment of the story itself. Still, I like the genre and it is a positive addition to it."
5,Good Message,"I read this book not too long ago in school in my tenth grade English class. I must say, this book is a great book. I admit I thought some of her views of egoism were a little strange and somewhat rebelious. However, I thought it was amazing and it gave a good message. We can't force people to be equal, we should let people live on their own. This book shows that Communism isn't as great as it seems. After all, Ayn Rand lived in the Soviet Union and she knew from living there that Socialism does not help individuals. When she came to the US, she thought life is better here. This book in a way also showed that we can still be equal as individuals and not as one. Ayn Rand qave a very good message."
3,"Anthem, a confusing but highly provocative novel","Anthem was a very different and defiant book. I felt that the themes were extremely interesting, and made me think a lot about the validity of society's values."
3,"Not exactly an ""I couldn't put it down"" book.","It's fun to read aloud so you can practice your acting but reading it silently gets a bit dull. At first, I was so confused about the ""we"" instead of ""I"" that I wondered if maybe that for every person there was about 7 people who spoke and acted all at the exact same time. Okay, okay, maybe it wasn't the brightest assumption but hey, It gets points for creativity. I didn't feel insulted by the book but perhaps it was a little to deep for a thirteen year old. Overall, I'm indifferent as far as liking or disliking it."
5,Wonderful,"Ayn Rand has put together a wonderful masterpiece of love, life, humanism, and morality. It is a beautiful work, portraying the beauty of freedom, and love. Bravo Ms. Rand!!!"
2,"An interesting idea, but not interestingly written","I had heard wonderful things about Ayn Rand, but was disappointed with the book. I understand how her philosophy has the ability to touch some people, but I found her quality of writing to be lacking, and the story line blurred and slightly corny."
3,"""We are Borg"" in AynRandian","A simple, straight forward, streamlined tale of the negative sides of altruism/collectivism/socialism set in a futuristic Dark Age w/o personal liberties, individualism or singular pronouns. A quick, enjoyable read."
4,Great introduction to Rand,"Anthem is a great intro to Rand's writing, appropriate for all ages, and definitely an easy read. Great for the classroom reading, even if you're not looking to get into philosophy."
4,early Ayn Rand,"This realatively short novel is one of Ayn Rands early works. It lets you see the themes she believed in all her life starting to emerge in her excellent story telling. If you are a Rand fan, you need to read this one."
1,Is there a way to give it negative?,"It's hard to get into, hard to read and I'm only on the first chapter. Not sure how people actually read it."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Never heard of this book until a few days ago. Quick read and very interesting narrative style, which really drives the point of how alien the new world depicted in the book is. You wish the book was longer, though.Anthem is in the public domain in the US, so I downloaded it from Project Gutenberg for free."
4,A Statement for the Individual,"Ayn Rand's ""Anthem"" is a great book for those that hold themselves as true individuals. Essentially this book communicates the glory of individuals as unique to themselves, as humanity a vast amount of countless beings all different from each other. ""Anthem"" is also a slap in the face of collectivism, of the idea that all people should work for the good of society as an abstract whole, without regards to themselves.This book was written to inform collectivists of the potentially dangerous circumstance that could occur from their ideology. We are essentially looking into a future where the individual is completely surrendered to a faceless entity called society. The book predated Orwell and Huxley and provides a no less chilling view of the future. Still vital today."
4,A classic introduction to Ayn Rand,"This book is a tale of a future were people are not permitted to pursue their own endeavors for their own reasons at their own ability. It chronicles the rise of a man who is held back by restrictions placed on him by those who ""know better"". Eventually, he breaks free of these chains and finds the truth about himself, his capabilities and the world around him. A short story by Ayn Rands standards it conveys the ideas of her other books and her philosophy, Objectivism, in an easy to understand way."
4,"Short, but worth it","This is my first Ayn Rand book. Before I read one of the 'big' novels (The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged), I might as well get an intro into her philosophy, I thought. To say the least, I got what I wanted. Anthem is an amazing book. Although to say that I agree with her philosophy wouldn't be totally truthful, she gets her point around beautifully. It is an amazingly powerful story with a civilization whose technology is par with the Dark Ages, and all emotion other than happiness is outlawed. My only gripe is the almost pathetic love story, but it's to be expected, since it hasn't been felt that way in hundreds of years. Well worth the 2 days or less it takes to read."
3,Weird. Tough to grasp.,"This book was hard to understand at first and was confusing. But it has a great message, and could serve as a warning to beware of the future."
5,"The birth of ""I""","Anthem is a short, powerful, and mind-bending journey. It starts in a deeply collectivistic society where there is no I, only we. It was actually hard to get at first how she was writing, only we, even individuals say we. But when I clicked in to how Rand was writing this, and the terrible picture she was painting of collectivism, it spurred me to look into my own life, at ways that I was denying my own ""I"" individual. I read this book a few times a year. It inspires me to question any and all themes of collectivism through family, spiritual, religious, and cultural conditioning. How else can I be I if I don't question areas I am being collectivistic. That's why I also regularly read a book titled, There's No Such Thing as a Negative Emotion. It has pointed a way to uncover in myself a healthy, authentic I."
4,Correction,"I just wanted to make note of a somewhat important error in this item's description: the picture on the front of this t-shirt is not ""a slice of tree""; it's the rings of hell from Dante's Inferno. Wood would be rather lame and make no sense. (This design comes from the one printed on the A-side of the Bleach album.) And yes, it bothered me enough to write a review - but hey, might as well have some accurate information out there.And I agree with the other reviewer in that this a a very awesome Nirvana t-shirt - and even though this item is a reproduction, it's at least an original design they actually used - and a very nice one at that.I only wish it came in smaller sizes."
5,Excellent book for the price.,"I have owned this book for 15 years and I think it is an excellent reference book for jewellers and metal smiths. It covers all types of metal work including gold and silversmithing, jewellery, stone setting and enamelling using traditional techniques. Written by Herbert Maryon O.B.E., who was one of London's best gold and silversmiths."
5,Sweet,"This is what all the modern jazz lovers and new jazz naysayers should be listening to. Don't waste your time with another musty wynton marsalis record. These compositions are tasty to no end, a sonic buffet if you will. If you want name-checks - there is a little Mingus, Coleman, Pastorius, Raymond Chandler, James Baldwin and bill Frisell in all of this. wait, Bill frisell is on this record. and so is julian priester. sweet jesus, check it out."
3,beginning,"the production hampers this one from being as great as their Seemless and Ignaurus albums, but there are some good songs on here. Most noteably the last two songs ""As It Were"" and ""Dare Me"" which contain a confident stride and show a strong sense of dynamics in their songwriting. also the acoustic classical guitar strum of ""For Lack Of A Better World"" is very nice. this album is probably not the best place for newcomers of Into Another to begin their search, but a nice addition for fans of the band."
5,Nokia BLC-2 Battery,"I bought this battery for my Nokia 6010 cell phone and I understood that there is a risk associated with this purchase. Some people complain that their new battery does not work better than the old one. Maybe it has something to do with the battery shelf life. However, I was lucky: my battery is a really new battery, it works exactly the same way as the original one worked when it was new - same stand-by time etc. Highly recommended..."
4,Battery blues,"The battery arrived almost immediately. Unfortunately, it's apparently my phone that's dying and not the battery. I will, however, certainly consider these guys for my future weird battery needs."
5,Phone Battery,"I had been scratching my head trying to figure out where to buy a replacement battery for my ancient cell phone. After many unsuccessful attempts at various cellular stores I was directed to go online to continue my search. In the first five minutes I had ordered a replacement battery and within three days it had been delivered. I will definitely order from here again. It was easy, fast, and completely reliable."
2,3310 phone battery,"I have an old 3310 nokia phone that I love dearly, so I was very excited to find replacement batteries for it. However; after ordering the batteries they took forever to be delivered for which I was most disappointed in the service, and had to contact the sellers twice about it. Not to discourage though, the price was good and they seem to be working just fine!"
2,Not Name Brand Item,"The battery (2) for my Nokia phones were received and as I opened them, noticed that there was no Nokia Hologram as my older batteries had. This made me suspect they were not original Nokia batteries. After installing them, one works okay (hours before recharge) but on the other, the power only lasts for a day, two at the most. Yes there was a return policy but for twenty bucks it is not worth the trouble. I just will not buy from this company again."
3,Didn't think I could find a battery for my Mom's OLD phone,"I was happy to find a battery to fit my mom's OLD Nokia. It's still pretty crappy when compared to talk times of newer phone's and batteries, but I was just happy to find a battery that fit her phone!"
5,Great experience,"From the very first search for product to receiving the product shopping with Amazon was nothing but easy, efficient, and pleasant. The product arrived in a timely fashion and was in mint condition. I highly recommend shopping with Amazon to anyone."
5,Absolutely satisfied!,"Awesome, no problem, I am totally satisfied with the Nokia BLC-2 Standard Replacement Battery, and the ship time was not lengthy at all, but more importantly, my phone works great once again!Thank You,Thank You,Thank You."
1,poor,the photo for the battery shows 'made in Japan' but I received 'made in China' battery.The battery doesn't have the Nokia sticker on the back of the battery. The original Nokia battery must have that sticker.
1,a piece of junk!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.ITS A PIECE OF JUNK.I SPENT 5.98 FOR NOTHING.I WAS SO AGGRAVATED,I JUST THREW IT AWAY.BUYER BEWARE, IF IT SAYS SHIPPED FROM WEBTREO,DO NOT BUY.IT WAS NOT A NEW BATTERY.IT WOULDNT EVEN TURN ON THE CELL.EVEN AFTER I CHARGED IT.NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!"
1,would not take a charge,This battery would not take a charge. Neither the AC home charger nor the DC car charger would charge it.
1,wrong battery,"It was not the right battery, and the phone won't even turn on with it in.I don't want to pursue this - not exchange it or anything. The battery I already have in the phone has started working well again. Maybe it had gotten a little wet or overheated.I am on a mission to keep life calm and simple. This $5 purchase is not worth haggling over."
2,low capacity,"good looking, original Nokia battery? Maybe.But it does not hold the power very long -2-3 days.However it is better, than my previous purchase from E-Bay."
2,batt quality,Battery was recieved in a sealed plastic wrapping and appears new.it must have been on a shelf a long time because it doesant hold a charge. its worse than my old battery. guess its time to retire the old nokia 6010 but i do like the extra output before the brain cancer scare laws went into effect from FCC. Nokia 6010 soon to RIP
5,Battery for cellphone,I ordered a Nokia battery for my cellphone and received it within the time factor given. This was a new battery I ordered and am completely satisfied with Amazon.com on this order and will in the future order via Amazon.com.Thank you for your great service.Johnny H. Godfrey
4,best on interest rates,"As all books purporting to provide an intermediate-level introduction on continous time finance, it suffers the disadvantage of being, I believe, formal but not formal enough;It nevertheless deserves to be bought, were it only for ch5 on interest rates, which is the best account of the topic I've ever read about in any single text!!In conclusion, it should, I think, be exploited in connection with more formal (not necessarily structured) textbooks on Ito calculus and stochastic differential equations (e.g. Oksendal, Ito/Mckean) to allow the reader to fully appreciate the magnificence of the topic."
5,Superb Introduction,"This is a beautifully crafted introduction to Ito calculus and its use in financial markets suitable for undergraduates or graduate business majors whose memory of Freshman Calculus has largely faded. It is logically organized so as to bring the student clear step by clear step from simple expectations to the introduction of serious financial models. At each step there are simple examples showing what is going on.It lacks computer exercises, and a serious course will want to supplement it with a computer lab having financial software.It was a joy to find such a beautifully crafted textbook."
2,Out of touch,"Nothing whatsoever to do with the real world. OK if you're an academic. As an ex-physicist I want something more modern, where are all the pdes? This book is just jargon, indecipherable probabilistic jargon."
2,Needs more material.,"More books are needed on this topic. Perhaps it was Duffie that started this needlessly complicated approach to texts on quantitative finance? Baxter and Rennie attempt to simplify the learning process but their effort remains too terse to be self-contained. Be prepared to have a couple of good references on probability and calculus handy if you don't happen to remember how to perform Erf(x) substitutions and apply DeMoivre-Laplace.Neftci's book is a better place to start this material. He's criticized for too much hand waving but it is an *INTRODUCTORY* text! Though not sufficient, it is far more accessible than other offerings."
4,"A Good Book, But not a Good Intro","Baxter & Rennie's book is really very enjoyable if you have already had experience with stochastic calculus, martingale methods, including Girsanov's Theorem, the Black-Scholes, and so forth. The writing is subtle and very concise, and every sentence is informatio-dense (to the point that it may be necessary to reread sentences over and over again to be certain that you have extracted the idea). A beginner receiving his first exposure to derivative pricing, however, unless he is mathematically very sophisticated, will not be pleased with this book, as it presumes more mathematical sophistication than the preface states, and focuses the crux of derivative mathematics (i.e., stochastic calculus) in one chapter. That said, this is a very good book and will be the standard for more advanced courses on the subject and for practitioners."
4,Worth reading,An interesting chronicle of a middle-age woman who sets off on a bicycle from upper Egypt to Uganda.
1,A biased book that confuses all the issues,"I read this from the perspective of a philosophy/theology teacher and found it, quite simply, awful. It is biased, prejudicial, makes unwarranted leaps and assumptions, displays apalling ignorance of the issues and texts....It is really quite astonishing how very ignorant this book is, and how selectively it not only quotes, but interprets everyone so as to fit the pre-conceived biases. I am speaking as someone with no dog in this fight as to being a so-called theological ""liberal"" or ""conservative,"" just as a trained logician/ethicist (and, full disclosure, as a Catholic) who would like to see truthful, reasoned argument.The only use I can see for this book would be in a freshman introductory course on logic or critical thinking, on how NOT to argue. But don't take my word for it; read the Vatican II texts themselves and decide for yourself."
1,the Devil's book,"the author is clearly very highly opinionated and it is all about her personal opinions, nothing to do with vatican II. she is obviously a leftist feminist who doesn't like the Pope.leave well alone"
2,Thinner than the book,"I would have had trouble following the plot if I had not read the book. As it was, the movie only has 1/2 the plot and characters as in the book. Not that interesting."
4,Nice,"This is a nice little, casual watch. I wear it to work so I don't mind if it gets beat up on(I work with kids). It's pretty durable and very comfy. I originally bought it for running purposes, but I can't seem to get the night light to stay on when I run at night. And I have yet to master all the various buttons and functions since I seemed to have misplaced the manual."
4,"Dark, disturbing, yet so beautifully done","Tsai Ming-Liang, who represents the new generation of filmmaking in Taiwan, described a very lonely and dark picture of the urban life for the western world. I think about Jim Jarmush's Stranger than Paradise, yet Tsai doesn't give his audience enough chance to laugh about things. Excellent acting and photography. Although in my mind not the best piece by Tsai, Vive L'amour is worth seeing and is definitely raw and requires a healthy stomach to digest it."

4,Extreme Milennium Collection,A good blend of Extreme's old numbers. I have quite enjoyed listening to it. The photos are a hoot....serious big hair.
5,"Great story, thought provoking","Buffalo Spirits is a beautifully written story. I don't think I've ever read a more loving description of the Kansas prairie - a place often overlooked as barren and dry, but she brings to life all the subtle beauties of the plains, reminding me of the things I loved about going there as a child to visit family.I really identified with and liked the main character, Becca, as she journeyed from girlhood, through her college years, and into adulthood. She is smart, real and likable. Much of the book is her life story - woven in with moving stories of the Native American tribe that had lived on the plains years before, and the modern demise of the small family farm and environmental damage to the prairie. The author is very effective at using the stories of individuals to make a larger point.This book really makes you think. And its a great read."
4,The story of the first heroes of the European invasion,"Rudder' s Rangers is a wonderful account of the guys who led off the invasion of the European theatre in World War ll .These men risked it all to set the stage for our troops landing on Normandy. Knowing Mr. Lane , this book is well researched and depicts actual events that without his efforts would have gone little noticed to the world unless you attended a war college or are a real student of the last great war. This book explores more detail than the movie Saving Private Ryan, and is biograpical and would make a wonderful sequel to the above mentioned movie. This is a time when we Americans need to remember our heroes , Rudder's Rangers fills that need."
1,Christopher Cross,Unfortunately the last copy listed as used was not an import.It is moot at this point. It was just listed in the wrong selection.I should have known that $8.48 sounded to good to be true.I will it give it to a friend. No harm done.
2,Not as good as I remembered,"I had Item Not Found on vinyl back in the day. When I saw that it was available on CD I knew I had to have it. But When I listen to it now I feel like... something's missing. I don't know how to explain it better. The cover art just doesn't seem to have the same impact in the smaller CD format, the liner notes aren't there, and without that hiss it feels so... empty. I'm disappointed."
4,Always the last place you look,I am glad Amazon finally found this. I am always losing it! Item Not Found holds a special place in my childhood. I remember many the day I would help my dad look for Item Not Found. I was really looking forward to getting my hands on one but I went to order and it said Item Not Found'.So if you can manage to find a supplier get a copy of Item Not Found (it's never where you think it is!)
2,Where is my item?,I ordered this item several months ago and still haven't received it. I think it got lost in the mail...
5,Awesome...,This is the absolute best product on the whole of Amazon. I would recommend this to anyone without reservation.
3,Slipstreamer spitfire,"Price was extremely good. Quality was OK. Only problems was its just a bit too small for wind deflection, and it tends to vibrate quite a bit."
4,Too Good To Be OOP!!!,"I used to own this LP way back when it mattered. It came complete with a cool printed inner sleeve. Although it didn't pack the same punch as ""Millions of Dead Cops"" or the Stains-John Wayne Was a Nazi EP it did have some totally awesome hardcore to its credit. Missile Destroyed Civilization, No More Cops, Skateboards From Hell and Country Squawk (AKA Chicken Squawk redone) were the memorable tracks for me. I hope someday someone puts this gem back out again!"
1,Poor battery life,The new battery i received was even worse.It gets discharge within half hour of talk.I had to always carry charger due to that.I ended up buying a new Cell.
5,great product,"purchased this product when my current cell phone battery went dead. this product arrived ahead of time, i placed it into the phone and it works great!."
5,Amazing technology,"If you love your old cell phone but worry about charging it too little or too much, this long-life baterry will help you better care for your valuable old cell phone."
2,No Hologram - Made In China Battery - Very Short Run Time,This battery says made in China. No Nokia hologram on it. Runs for only 30% of the time the original battery did. Not happy.
2,Supplier makes a difference,"I bought the BL-5C from Amazon twice, but I didn't pay attention to the supplier. This product came from Just Cellular. It came wrapped in a plain sleeve. The battery had Nokia markings and was labelled Made in Japan. I will watch to see how much life I get from it.I bought others from Amazon, wrapped in sealed bag, bar coded, with date of 09/08/2011. The battery itself is marked ""cell made in Korea with furhter processing in China"". The battery has a Nokia hologram.I draw two possible conclusions: 1) the Just Cellular battery is a fake, or (2) the Just Cellular is very old stock. Neither brightens my day."
2,Seems Like a Used Battery,"Very disappointed.I got this because the old battery, which was4-5 years old, seemed to be going. It went from holding a charge for 8-10 days - light usage and standby - to holding a charge for three days with the same usage.I bought this one. It came promptly and seemed to be okay, though I didn't look closely. It holds a charge for three days with (very) light usage and standby.I waited awhile to write this review, because a tiny note on a tiny tag says it may require three charges before it reaches maximum capacity. Well, now it has had four or five charges (charging now, Thurs. afternoon after having been charged Sunday night) and it's still the same deal. Three days, with almost no calling.As I said, very disappointed. I'm going to write the seller tonight, see how they respond."
1,careful - don't get a used one,"I purchased one from OEM and it was supposed to be new, but came in open plastic sleeve. It has almost zero capacity, lasts about 2 hours after charging full overnight."
1,Im Very Sad....,"Amazing... Im very sad... My battery is not working properly. It seems a used battery!!!When I bought it, I thought that would be a big hit!! But not."
2,Not so great,I have an old phone with the original battery. I had hoped to keep it going because I really like the phone. I bought the new extended life battery expecting it to give me a lot longer use between charges. Not going as well as I had expected. It is only somewhat better.
5,good life,The batteries were replacements for current phone. They fit perfectly .They work really well and hold the charge a long time.
4,It works!,"I tried another Amazon vendor before this one to get a battery for my Nokia phone. That battery looked like it had been run over by a truck, was dead as a door nail and wouldn't take a charge. The battery I purchased from this vendor works. It charges, and the charge lasts a reasonably long time before having to be recharged. All I needed was a battery that works. I got it with this vendor."
3,It's a battery,It's a battery. It fits the phone and it doesn't seem to be counterfeit. My only complaint was the delivery time which was much longer than expected and there was no useful information about shipping status on line.
4,It's performing as expected but it's not new,"i have no issues with the battery except that i think it's a second hand battery when i thought i bought a new one. i think it's used because it didn't came in its original packaging but in a plastic. but again, it's performing as expected so no complaints for now."
4,Nokia battery,Purchased Nokia battery to replace damanged cell phone battery. To purchase from Tmobile was $40 but I found one on Amazon so much cheaper. Item was exactly as described and is working great. Fast and free shipping. Would definitely purchase from them again.
4,Great Battery,This is a Great Battery for the iPevo S0-20 Skype Wifi Phone. Perfect replacement for the original battery - works great.
2,Otdered wrong item want radio/recorder with connections that don't waiver depending on which way you hold you heal!,"I ordered the wrong item, but It wasn't much money. I was looking for a radio/recorder, that sounds good when I am in a building such as the YAny suggestions?Ian Anderson"
1,"Battery not ""new""","I received two ""new"" Nokia batteries from this company. I am using one of the batteries now and it is definitely not new as I need to charge it every third or fourth day. It did not even look new when I received it. I have not tried the other ""new"" battery, but it was completely dead when it arrived. I do not plan to buy from this vendor again."
3,Met my needs.,"I purchased this battery as a replacement battery for my IPEVO S0-20 Wi-Fi Phone for Skype. It met my needs. My only concern is the battery did not arrive in retail packaging. It was simply wrapped in a plastic bag, which makes me wonder if this item is a genuine Nokia product or a counterfeit."
2,Died will not hold charge,"Used a few times with the SimplyVibe SV-X6U1-Black Rechargeable FM, MP3 Player and Portable and was allways dead No recommand"
1,Have not yet received it,I have not received it yet.I have not received it yet.I have not received it yet.I have not received it yet.I have not received it yet.I have not received it yet.
1,Bad Battery,I have went through 3 of these batteries for my Nokia and none of them have held a charge all day after several texts and a couple of few minute calls:(Very weary of trying another but I don't want to part with my old phone.
1,not something as I expected,"I got a used battery in bad shape after a long waiting.when you get things from market place, watch out this site."
4,Replacement battery for Nokia flip phone,This is a great price on the original battery for this older phone. It shipped right away too. Just what I needed.
1,As goodas the original,Worked great & at the right price! A good replacement battery for the OEM one that quite! At this price you can't go wrong
4,Power Source,Received promptly and is already in use in my cell phone. Time will tell if it will last. Original lasted 6 years.
3,Battery only average,This battery only holds a charge for perhaps 5 days and runs out rapidly in use...not so happy with it however it is much better than the old one that had to be charged every night...
5,Replacement Battery,Battery was a replacement for one in an older phone which had to be put back into use due to a newer phone having problems. Arrived ahead of schedule and has returned this older phone to original operating battery life. Plus it was an excellent price.
4,Okay Knife,"Knife is by far the cheapest I have gotten from Buck and that was shown in design. Feels very light and fragile, despite having a long blade. Metal bar does not go all the way though handle."
3,Very light for its size,This knife is okay as a utility knife. I would recommend Buck Vantage over this knife in the EDC role however. I also don't care for the pocketclip design on this knife. I prefer a knife to sit lower in the pocket.Pros:1. Very lightweight.2. Very inexpensive.3. Fairly good handle traction.Cons:1. Stiff opening makes it hard to do one handed.2. Not very balanced (i.e. top heavy due to lack of liner)3. Poor pocketclip design which makes the knife stick out of pocket a little bit.Hard to go wrong with such an inexpensive Buck knife. If you are looking for a EDC knife and have maybe 10 dollars more to spend in the budget I would recommend the Buck Vantage Select over this knife.
4,Great knife,"It's easy to sharpen, gets sharp and holds the edge pretty well. 420HC from Buck is as good as you get in the world of 420HC. I keep in on my camelbak when cycling and running so it is exposed to sweat and water regularly yet, the rust build up is slight compared to another knife made from AUS8 steel. (Caribbean weather)Locking mechanism is secure and the handle feels good in the hands (size L gloves). I will recommend this knife to friends and intend to buy a buck omni hunter (made of the same steel) soon."
4,who is anita liberty and what is her mission in life?,"hello, all you 102:11 readers. if you've gotten this far, you'll notice that no one else knows that anita liberty is a character invented (as in created and performed) by the author. give the book a second read--it's much more fun if you know what's really going on. suzanne weber will thank you for it."
2,For Some Women...,"I finally realized that this book appeals to a small segment of women who have had great difficulty in achieving meaningful relationships with men. Of the few women I know who like this book, not a one of them has ever had an intimate and good relationship with a man (or, actually, with a woman). Anita Liberty must be the same kind of woman, which I find sad. Hell, if it makes some people happy, then I give it two stars."
1,Words as Best Weapon,"Them's fighting words, Anita Liberty. And sometimes entertaining, too. Kept my attention and I'm a guy. But alas, in the end, just another slip of a book with not enough quality to earn all these glowing reviews. Sorry. This one don't fly."
4,Fun if you have a sense of humor,"A girlfriend gave me this book as a birthday gift. It is very funny! I laughed out loud. ""Anita""'s crazy actions allow you to laugh and not do any of the stupid stuff she thinks about. I might not have found it so funny if I was in the depths of true heartbreak, but from the healthier perspective I am at now, it was great fun. I read parts of it aloud to other girlfriends. Great fun!"
5,"Finally, someone who understands...","Anita Liberty has finally been able to put into print some of the feelings I had no description for. This collection of poetry, diary exerpts and advice puts a bit of sadistic humor into a personally painful experience. While not always agreeing with Anita's opinions or her actions, her motives are just. She possesses the ultimate in vindictiveness that we all would love to use, just once... maybe just a little. Her brutal honesty about her emotions and her direct and unyielding attack on her ex is the best therapy around if your ""someone special"" has left you hurting."
1,Shame on anyone who finds this book amusing,Some suggest that this book is only a joke. Hate is never a joke. Ms. Liberty's attempt at humor is unacceptable.
1,"Oh, please!","A curious title- being very hurt and wondering if this was really possible I ordered it. The book was so bad I had to toss it in the waste can in order that it not be noticed on my bookshelf. I would like to comment on it's content, but unfortunately, there really wasn't any."
1,"Revenge on the Boyfriends, Part II","While the premise held a lot of promise, reading this book left me empty and hurting. The supposed comedy is thinly veiled behind this author's angst, regret, fear, and pain, I could hardly laugh. In contrast to the other review here, I say ""Move on, Hate Girl!"" and hang a different name around your neck, like ""Who Cares 'Cause I'm Moving On, Girl"". I suggest reading Cynthia Heimel if you want a funnier, wittier, more insightful perspective on love."
4,A surefire remedy for heartbreak,This is the ideal gift for any friend who's suffered a callous rejection. Anita Liberty takes perfect revenge on her unfaithful lover by pillorying him mercilessly in her hilarious stand-up comedy routine. Success and fame follows and her caddish lover even tries to winkle his way back into her shiny new life - only to be made even more of a public joke. Her revenge is doubly sweet.
1,Not Good,"I don't care if I'm supposed to ""wake up"" and realize this is comedy...IT'S NOT FUNNY! It's just a stupid, bad book. Really passe. Completely over done and totally, oh God, do I have to say it, Been there done that! If you want it, go to my local Brooklyn Salvation Army. It's sitting in a bag marked ""JUNK""."
2,just o.k.,"Not so funny for my standards!So much hate, actually for nothing. I don't suppose this Mitchell had made her done all these ""amazing"" things for him...she wanted it, and that's why she has done it! I wonder what's soooo wrong about a person falling in love with someone else... if she was less egoistic and not such self-centered....she would be a much happier person!"
1,Slim Read,"Like what's plaguing television actresses, this is a skinny, insubstantial, and hungry book. After reading it...well, what I could get through...I had a big meal so that I'd feel better. Let's aspire to something higher (oh look, I'm a poet too!)."
5,A classic in my own little world...,"I don't know anyone else who knows this band. The first time I've heard of them was when I bought ""Dyslexicon"" really cheap in a dusty second hand shop... and I loved it so much I just wanted more Dandelion. So I went back to the same shop and found ""I think I'm Going To Be Sick""... It managed to make me forget all about ""Dyslexicon"" and how much I cherrished it.The two albums (which, sadly appear to be the only ones) are very different in ways of production. It is an interesting contrast... ""Dyslexicon"" has a massive, almost saturated sound with only four members (the singer on guitar) while this album sound a lot cheaper and features the band as a five piece (the singer not on guitar). If you like albums like ""Bleach"" by Nirvana or any of the other Grunge and Sub Pop bands then give these two albums a chance."
4,Recorded in the late 1920's,"Jacques Thibaud (1880-1953) was a successful soloist and concerto performer best known for his chamber collaborations with Casals and Cortot. This CD contains transfer recordings by Thibaud of violin and piano sonatas by Faure, Debussy and Franck (recorded in 1927 and 1929). The performances are superb, but the original 1920's recording technology is not."
3,Al's not ready for the added responsibility!,"For over the last seven years, Al Gore has changed the way people look at the job of Vice-President. This book is the record of his opinions, positions and recorded public statements.Covering the spectrum from A to Z, you'll read the way Al Gore feels about abortion, education, welfare, government spending, environmental issues, free trade and so many others.While I may not agree with many the statements, nor agree with many of the positions, I will say that Al Gore's positions are clear and well spoken. Gore's ability to articulate his position is very well done.Overall this book will show you a side of Al Gore that the media has only scratched. A good read for those thinking about going into politics or working with political campaigns."
2,Not a strong singer.,"There's a reason some people usually are and should remain background vocalists. Patti Scialfa's voice is paper-thin and she has pitch problems. The songs, all of which she is credited with either writing or co-writing, are fairly good. In fact, they sound like Bruce Springsteen songs. Coincedence? I doubt it. If she wasn't married to Bruce Springsteen, I don't think this album would have ever been made. As Patti sings in the song, ""Lucky Girl"": ""Oh, I guess I'm a lucky girl. I've been lucky since I found you"". You can say that again, Patti."
2,She's just the Little Lady,"I'm a great fan of Bruce's work, so when I saw this album in the shops, I immediately bought it. The woman knows how to write a good song. But she can't entertain me for an album's lenght.. And then, she's lucky to have a musical man like Springsteen, who will work for free. That's her luck, because of his name, there will be some people who buy this. The best tracks are the ones where Springsteen himself plays the guitar and that is simply too little. i don't think she will ever be allowed to make a second album. We can only hope for Springsteen. So that people don't buy bad albums because he's worked on them. If you would like to hear some really good singers, try Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, on the Western Wall, they do songs both by Springsteen as well as Miss Scialfa. Guess which one is the better ???"
1,"not only is love blind, it's deaf as well","My 13 year old son bought me a copy of Rumbledoll in a used CD store, as he knows I'm a big e-street fan. He put it in the car cd player, listened for a while, removed it, wiped it off, and reinserted it. Then, he stared at the photographs that accompanied the cd and said, ""not only is love blind, it's deaf as well."" Scialfa has a thin, high-pitched, whiny voice that is difficult to listen to, she sounds like someone stepped on her tail. The lyrics are juvenile and self serving. No redeeming qualities at all."
1,The luckiest person since Ringo Starr,"Patti Scialfa has to be the luckiest person on this planet since Ringo Starr. She is such a limited talent! The only good career move she made was opening her legs to Bruce Springsteen. She is as vital a part of the E Street Band as a brick. She had no right standing on the same stage (in the front, I might add) on the last tour. The fact that she ""wore"" a guitar on the same stage as Nils Lofgren is even more of a disgrace. Be able to sing the high part on ""Trapped"" and ""Out on the Street"" doesn't make her a member of one of the greatest bands in rock and roll history. I'm glad Bruce found his soul mate; just keep her off the stage because she doesn't belong with the mighty E Street Band. And anyone who thinks Ringo Starr deserves to be considered an equal in the Beatles is equally lost!"
2,Straight through your head without leaving a trace,"Patti Scialfa has a similar voice to Beth Orton and Stacey Earle. I can see that some people like this girlish approach but I prefer a deep and strong voice over a tender and fragile one, any day. The material on this album ""Rumble doll"" isn't that good, but I must say that I really love the captivating song ""Baby don't"", and I think ""Charm light"" is rather good. The rest of the songs don't stick out at all, and they have a tendency to melt, or blend, together. I wouldn't say that the songs are particularly bad or so, but the main problem is that they don't excite you in any way - they don't even upset you. The best time to put on this album is while you have friends over for dinner, and need something soft in the background, something that don't interrupt with your conversation."
1,Even Pro Tools can't help,"No amount of mastering and effects can overcome the fact that this woman can't sing. Furthermore these songs try hard to be street smart but miss the sincereity mark. Sort of like the getto movies of the 70s that just aren't realistics.No hooks, no vocals heavy vocal effects....how she ever got signed is beyond me."
5,She Just Keeps Getting to You - Its Addictive,"Have had this CD for about 8 months. I've burned 3 copies - 1 for the car, 1 for the pickup, and 1 to keep in the CD player. The original is put away. Never before have I done this with a tape or CD. Its amazing to me that I could listen to anything at least once a day and never tire of it. Other than Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, or Willie Nelson, I don't care to hear the same thing more than about once a month. She doesn't sound like anyone other than Patti Scialfa - in a class all by herself. Ms Scialfa possesses extraordinary talent. She owes it to herself and the world to do more."
4,great crusin' music,"has ""wall of sound"" feel that spector made famous in the 60's...still works today. this cd is usually in the car changer,for long distance hauls. cant wait for the new one to arrive..."
5,A Jersey girl's triumph,"I was waiting for something like this and now it's here. Patti was always a great singer and now she shows her songwriting abilities, too. She finally managed to overcome the ""Springsteen backup"" phase. A great album. Bruce, man, be proud of her!"
5,"great band, great tunes and great singer","I listened recently to this recording for the first time in quite a while, and it sounds as strong as ever. The only regrettable thing about this release is the ""married to Springsteen"" connection. Regrettable in that it no doubt accounts for the neglect this release recieved from critics and public. This CD is similar in some respects to Lucinda Williams in that it is note-perfect in every cut. The sound is guitar driven, solid Heartbreakers professional, with a girl-group almost doo-wop sound at times, if that makes any sense.Have no expectation of a Bruce sounding outing. If Scialfa had released this as a solo artist with no Springsteen baggage, It would hopefully have gotten the attention it deserves."
1,Zero Stars,"I found this book in a cottage in the woods while on vacation and read it, despite the warning disquised as a description on the back cover. I understand it is dated (1985??), but this book if offensive to everyone; native americans, women, gay men, medical professionals.The ""protagonist"", Georgia, is a whiney woman who is only complete in the arms of a man (any man, apparently, even if he stole her jewelry or arranged for a drug induced gang rape). She remains this way throughout. I also found a couple of typos, some poor grammar choices and a typsetting error that had me confused at a page break. I can't believe I read the whole thing, I hope Pat Gaston is no longer writing."
2,won't buy any Pantene stuff in future,"I'm sorry, but I have to say Pantene shampoo, and their conditioner, is probably the worst among what I have used up to now. The shampoo makes the hair really dry and twisted, AND the hair is not clean yet. The conditioner doesn't do any job in smoothing it back either. I won't use Pantene product any more in future."
3,front fender,"This is a very simple design. It mounts on the frame and not the wheel, so when you turn the wheel, the tire spray will not be blocked by the fender. I have not tried it yet, but I suspect it will work fine because most riding is done in a straight line. I have a Cannondale R600 road bike with a fat aluminum tube so the mounting strap that comes with the fender will not reach around the tube. I will use a long zip tie and mount it only when needed. I am sure this will be better than nothing at all."
1,Poor performance!!,"Be aware that this is not ""The Best of Deep Purple"". It is a poor 1988 live performance which lacks the original magic. DON'T BUY IT!!!!"
4,If you like romance you'll like this,"Beyond All Reason won't make you pause to savor a phrase or wipe away tears of empathy or even think much about it after you finish the last page. But it will make you chuckle, sigh and relax. It's a great escape beach book and I think there's a place in life for reads like this! There are lots of times I don't want a gut-wrenching emotional read that I dwell on for days after (I still can't get scenes from Karin Kallmaker's Maybe Next Time out of my head and it's been two weeks now) and Peggy Herring can really soothe and let me just enjoy. Trina's family are absolutely rotten to her because she's gay, and Trina's way of handling it is a lesson in wit and tenacity!"
3,Can't always be great,"This is not Herring's best work. Usually, I can read her stuff in one gulp. I had to work at this one. The plotting seems loose and the characters with the exception of Rosalie, superficial. It's almost as if she went back and reworked an early manuscript. Not up to par."
3,decent book,"I have mixed emotions about this book. On one hand, it really irritated me. There was too much sex, and not enough romance. Trina & Rosalie couldn't have a serious conversation without groping each other. Several issues were left unresolved. The book also moved WAY too fast. There was no in-depth description of their courtship, it just jumped straight into the sex. The ending really bothered me. It was unrealistic, and it reminded me of a bad movie of the week.On the other hand, this book was oddly appealing. It had some good humor, and once I got past the flaws, I actually started to like the book. The relationship between Trina & her parents really tugged at my heartstrings. I think that's the most memorable part of this book for me. All in all, the book was fairly decent. Not my favorite, but still enjoyable."
5,warm feeling deep within,"Peggy writes them simple and sweet with just enough sass to keep you thumbing the pages and glad you get that warm feeling deep within when reading her books. The story has a bit of a twist to it, and you think beyond all reason was the right title. Good characters, very interesting storyline and just enough sensual throbs to satisfy the most demanding reader. Great read."
5,Priscilla - Queen of Graceland!,"Priscilla - young and beautiful. She gives us a wonderful tour of Graceland, inside and out. She shows us rooms inside Graceland, and outside we get to see Elvis' cars, the pool, the Meditation Garden. It's a sweet and tender tour, and a great way for Priscilla to honor her man, Elvis. This should be made into a DVD. I'd like to see Priscilla do another tour of Graceland soon."
4,Nice vase,"Great price, I thought the elephants on the vase were going to be a bit more detailed, they're small and kind of molded into the vase so you really have to know it's an elephant, can't tell just by looking at it. The colors work well with my living room so I don't mind."
3,Ok game,"Its not a bad game the concept is pretty cool but what really sucks is the camera view it sometimes flips out , but other than that not bad if you pay under $10 bucks for it lol..."
5,#1 game for first time M-rated gamers,"Luckily, this game is found to be the most masterful and for those who are new to mastering video games at this rating. It finally provides a variety of skills to pass the entire thriller.Unfortunately, most of the M-rated games are callous, sometimes take a very, very, very long time to master each one, involve much of the perplexities and acquire so much energy.As a result, this is a very important recommendation regarding the issue of the adult video gaming and for individuals who plan to master the fighting, action, horror and other types of video games in their future lives.Thank you for your time and patience!"
2,Forget it.,It's supposed to be really hard. If you're up for the challenge then try it but if not then FORGET IT.
4,Interesting,"I am not sure why I bought this slim novel, but it was an interesting read. The theme is one that should interest most. However, the editing is poor and distracting. The author spends the first twenty or so pages convincing us that he is a witty guy. Once the author commits to the story, the writing improves. I couldn't help but think that in the hands of a good editor that this book had great possibilities, especially if the characters were more memorable and life on the Island was more fully realized."
4,Great story deluted only because it was a cable TV movie,"Living Proof was written for and shown on cable, and while the message and story was great, it suffered from the inherent cost limitations and abrupt editing cuts for a TV movie with time constraints. The Harry Connick Jr. portrayal of the researcher's struggle, stress and frustration with limited, funds, legal hurtles, FDA requirements that cost lives was portrayed well and many a tear could fall as he struggled to save the lives of victums of a fast growing and unique form of stage four cancer. The doctor/researcher followed the rules to insure success for the masses while the rules cost the lives of many. His nemesis, all real live must live with, appeared to have no feelings for those who suffer was portrayed perfectly. As an engineer in the medical field I felt the pain he felt. I am glad I purchased this video so that I could share it with friends who know of others fighting this terrible disease."
4,Living Proof,Living Proof movie is great because it shows how difficult it is to get new drugs on to the market
4,great movie,any one who knows someone with breast cancer will enjoy this movie I enjoy watching Harry Connick Jr any time
4,"Worth seeing, with some caveats","This is a solid movie. Harry Connick Jr. gives a very fine performance in the lead role. The supporting cast is also good, Swoosie Kurtz in particular. There are two main flaws. First, the movie suffers from the usual weaknesses of medical stories: artificial setup dialogue, a too-bad-to-be-true villain to provide conflict, and too many tear-jerking moments. Second, it verges on being propaganda for drug companies. The general view taken by the writer is that drugs and Science offer the only path to healing; one cancer patient who dabbles with alternative therapies is presented in a decidedly negative light. Still, it's a great story, certainly a cut above the usual Lifetime fare, and worth seeing."
1,The dumbest movie ever!,"So contrived and poorly written and editted this has to be a joke!! What a waste of time watching it - thank goodness I didn't buy it but only borrowed it from the library. I was expecting so much more but certainly didn't receive it. Poor acting, poor story line - too bad such a great story was done so badly!"
2,smells like a wet yellow dog.,the writer gave intense concern about the family back home and his farm animals. he was sick for nearly his entire participation in the war. boring.......zzzzzzzzzzz.
1,dont buy mad mods and englishmen,most of the songs have been rerecorded and not for the better. stay away from this one!
5,Lemongrass adds the perfect touch,"This is one of my favorite teas. This tea is very light, but still is a great morning pick-me-up. The orange and lemongrass balance so well with the black tea that this tea does not need anything added like milk or sweetener. This is definitely a tea I will always keep in stock."
5,M.D.C. - Essential USA Hardcore,"...Hailing from the always politically-aware San Francisco East Bay area, M.D.C. released this incredible album of political awareness & excellent hardcore music straight into the hair-band/sensitive guy abyss of the '80s.Taking shots at... social icons ranging from the Reagan cronies all the way to El Exijente's big-business driven coffee bean scams, the album forged the way for literally hundreds of punk bands.An absolute essential listen for anyone who is tired of being force-fed the sterile ""punk"" music on MTV."
5,I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end,"I read a lot of autobiographies, and ""Hold the Roses"" is one of the most candid and well written I've read. Rose Marie has not only lived a very interesting life; she's written a very entertaining book. I knew her as part of the sentence ""I'll take Rose Marie to block"" from her regular appearances on Hollywood Squares. I knew she had been on ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" and knew very little else about her. I didn't know about Baby Rose Marie, the little girl born out of wedlock who became a star on radio and in vaudeville; whose father didn't marry her mother but supported his ""real family"" by managing her career until he tried to have her killed. She did more than rub elbows with the famous and infamous of her day. And as interesting as her show business recollections are, the book recounts a love story that is both funny and touching. Rose Marie has had an incredible career. And she's topped it off by writing a wonderful book. I'm so glad I read it."
4,Highly Recommend this Page Turner!,"From beginning to end this is one of those books that is difficult to put down. It was great to learn about Rose Marie's life and career before and after she played the part she is best known for (to me anyway), ""Sally Rogers"" on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"". The love story between her and her beloved husband was magical and could she be any more proud of her daughter?! Reading and learning about the various celebrities (including the notorious ones) with whom she worked and was acquainted was quite interesting. Like some others have mentioned, I would have liked to read more about her time with the DVD show, but maybe she will favor us with a second book based on that experience!"
3,Semi-enjoyable,"Interesting book for the most part although more time should have been spent about ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"". I was very disappointed with the way she ended the book however. To keep everyone guessing about the black bow and then to say it is a secret is disgraceful."
3,Hold The Roses by Rose Marie,I cannot give this book 5 stars as towards the end of the book I was beginning to get very bored.Now that I think back from the start- she had the habit of referring to herself as the one whowas Super Woman.I really don't see how she had the time to do everything she claims to have done with this script and that arrangement.If she was trying to make the reader feel sorry for her she succeeded in the beginning. Seems the book went down hill in telling her story after her husband died-a shame it could have been a great book had she left out the names dropping etc.
3,Another self-centered celebrity ego trip,"Rose Marie sounds like a really nice person and realized a happy marriage and successful grown daughter were the most important things in life. Yet, her book goes into boring detail about every show, every person she ever met, every crowd reaction. It got so repetetive. And the section on Dick Van Dyke show was the part I was looking forward to and she mostly talked about going out to dinner after the show. She didn't even mention Jerry Paris and hardly Morey Amerserdam. A lot of eating and shows and name-dropping. I skipped over most of it and pretty much got the feeling she loved show business and a good time partying. Makes me glad I never had the show business bug because it sure overwhelms your life."
4,Great CD for people who are not 100% devoted to ska or jazz!,"This is a great CD for people who are not 100% devoted to ska or jazz! If you like both types of music, then this is the band for you... Nice smooth jazz with the ska upbeats ect."
5,Big Sugar = Big Time Underrated,"Because Gordie Johnson is a world class guitarist and producer and they have a bunch (not all) of sweet songs.All Music Guide says:""Brothers and Sisters, Are You Ready? is loaded with a batch of dependable high-octane rock crunchers (particularly album opener ""Red Rover,"" lead single ""Nicotina,"" and ""All Hell for a Basement""As a Canadian I've heard of Big Sugar since they are popular here but have never bought an album. I noticed their musicianship before but after hearing ""Red Rover"" and especially ""All Hell for a Basement"" I realised that their good stuff can easily rival the best stuff on American/European radio today.As a student of music I must recommend this album if only for the production value, ""All Hell for a Basement,"" and Gordie Johnson's vocals and guitar.""So Not Over"" is pretty cool too (notice the background vocals in the hook. And if you're a singer, this guy's phrasing (vocal and guitar) is awesome."
3,nice part of collection but wish it was bigger,I'm a big fan of soundwave & glad I got it to add to my collection buti'm not the biggest fan of small figures. zI just wish they made it a bit bigger
1,WARNING: DON'T BUY SONY'S INFECTED CDs,"I have used Easy CD-DA Extractor to copy EMI's COPY CONTROLLED CDs.http://www.poikosoft.com/The copied discs play everywhere. I don't know if it kills the Sony worm, but I can't risk damaging my computer and leaving it open to hackers. Arrogant Sony won't cough-up the damage. Neil Diamond has the clout to stop this."
3,Sadly disappointed wt 12 Songs+2,"After the hype I had been reading on Neil's latest project, I eagerly purchased the CD. I would strongly recommend interested buyers to listen to many samples before purchasing. As a long-time fan, I was delighted and impressed with his last release: ""Three Chord Opera"". It represented an updated, fresh and extremely innovative form of the Neil Diamond that has thrilled audiences for decades. Not so with 12 Songs! While the recording quality was superb, the general atmosphere and content of this new offering is depressive and pathetic. Neil has always had his melancholy moments, but a whole CD of it... and NO BAND... I was almost ready to pitch it after the first track, ""Mary, Mary."" We've watched & listened to the incredible balladeer and entertainer recently, and he still has the stuff; its just not on this CD. Buyer Beware!"
5,Back to Basics,"&#65279;Introspective and soulful. This work is back to basics for Neil, but it's more than that. It's a real look into why he is a great musician and writer.Listen---really listen and you'll agree he feels each word and isn't afraid to share them with the rest of the world."
5,"hell, yeah!","""Oh Mary, hell yeah!!! Captain of a shipwreck, evermore save me a Saturday night -- delirious love, I'm onto you. What's it gonna be, man of God? Create me. Face me. We.""wow. As with the late Johnny Cash, and apart from all of the other positives, this is distinguished by the beauty of the mature, life-weary and still joyful voice, familiar and new -- the inimitable patina of age. Hope Sony fixes the problem, and that we can tell that we are buying safe CDs -- in time for Christmas giving."
5,Beautiful heartfelt new CD. Simply Outstanding.,"This CD is Neil Diamond at his very best. Stripped down to just vocals, acoustic guitar and some incredible lyrics written by one of the greatest songwriters of our time, Neil Diamond.The lyrics hit home a la Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. Neil Diamond is a national treasure and this new CD is a gem."
1,12 Songs Neil Diamond,"The CD is clearly one of Neil's best. It goes back to his roots. Speaking of roots; the SONY root kit, the DMCA will make this the first Neil Diamond recording that I will not play. It is my understanding that SONY has installed its DRM software on this CD and DRM software can crash your computer. SONY doesn't care about your computer or the music only its profits. Not only can this sneaky software installation crash your computer it can open your system up to hackers. As great as Neil Diamond is I will purchase NO SONY product until they stop this process. Boycott SONY and win back your computer!"
1,This does deserve zero stars,"I've heard the music. It's great.But, what if a great kids toy has a fatal flaw. Some kids use it and choke to death. Not, all kids, just a few hundred. I think thats worth factoring into the rating.This CD kills PCs. Getting rid of a rootkit is hard. Sony does't even provide a way to remove it. They simply make it visible.Where is Neil Diamond on this issue? Don't the artists have some responsibility? Or, at least a voice.Pretty sounds. Evil intent. Bad product."
1,DRM = Dangerous Rootkit Malware,Sony should be ashamed for infecting computers in which this CD is played.Amazon should stop selling this CD given the damage that is known to cause.
1,Product contains Virus - Buyer beware.,"It has now been stated by McAffee & other virus protection companies that the copy protection system used on this CD and many other SONY CDs is a Virus. Use of this CD can be regarded in some circumstances as knowingly propagating a virus which is illegal in many countries. I advise to avoid, and for Amazon to beware of selling such a product."
1,Awful CD,This cd is horrible. I can't believe Sony would put their customers' computers at risk like this! I will never buy another Sony product of any kind. I don't trust them anymore!BOYCOTT SONY!
2,Very disappointing,"This is the most depressing 12 songs I've ever suffered through. Is Neil getting older, or is it the audience? Not one of his new tunes is upbeat. He's written his own obit in ""Hell Yeah"", his own version of ""My Way"" which should be followed by ""who cares?"" and what's up with his new found religion? The lyrics are trite, dull and boring and certainly not what we fans would have expected from someone who's insight was so inspiring in ""Don't Look Down"" and ""I Believe in Happy Endings"" from his last album. We're all getting older, we don't need 12 songs to remind us. I think it's time Mr. Diamond hang up his guitar."
1,I would give it no stars if I could,"Thanks you to all the reviewers for honestly expressing themselves and letting the buyers know about the spyware attached to this CD. I signed on with the purpose of seeing if I could listen to some snippets of songs (I could not)and then saw the reviews. I don't care how good this CD is, I WILL NOT buy it or any other Sony CD (I had already experienced a problem when trying to upload the new Patty Loveless CD to iTunes for placing onto my iPod). I hate to punish the artist in this way, but until Sony quits punishing the audience -- the people who are buying the music -- in this inane, ridiculous, and money-grabbing manner, I will not be buying any Sony products, let alone this CD."
1,Sony Should be Ashamed,"After purchasing this CD, I popped it in my computer hoping to listen as I did some work on the pc. Then--as you know by now--Sony's reprehensible software attached itself to my computer.Sony should be ashamed of itself. They're penalizing those of us who pay for our music honestly. I can't believe the nerve and the unethical gall of this, and I think they owe me an apology and some recompense. I also think that Sony artists are cowardly and careerist for not coming out and supporting the fans on this issue--they're not to blame, but they're certainly involved here.After a life spent buying Sony electronics and Sony/Columbia recordings, I plan never to purchase another of their products again. I'll listen to my Springsteen and Diamond and Yo-Yo Ma, etc. on the radio from now on."
5,Neil is Back!!!,Quite possibly the best work Neil has done since the early 70s! You can tell how hard he worked on this one!
1,Avoid this and similar CDs!,If you want to play this CD in your computer it will install harmful software on you computer. Do not buy this.

1,Open letter to Sony,"This is in regards to Sony's draconian DRM (spyware):Sony, what the hell were you thinking? Are your executives so detached from the real world? How greedy can your corporation get? Music is about freedom of expression, NOT being shackled down by corporate avarice. I'm so glad this kind of technology wasn't around in the 60's.Do you wonder sometimes why people, like me, turn to small independent labels? THIS is why. In the immortal words of the band Carcass:Please tell me how to thinkPlease tell me what to sayPlease tell me what to doPlease tell me how I should behavePlease tell me what to singPlease tell me what to playPlease tell me how to actPlease tell me the rules of your gamePlease tell me who I should bePlease tell me what to doPlease tell me how to pleaseI really want to be like youReally done it now, sold outBut to who, what, when, where and how,Yeah, really done it now, sold out,I've taken my cutAnd corporate rock really sucks"
1,No thanks...I have an Ipod,I purchased this CD only to find out that I cannot load it onto my Ipod. I'm planning on returning it.
4,Neil Diamond: 12-Songs,"(it really is 5 stars) Me and a friend of mine did ""Rate the Record"" We broke it down to 3 categories. Like, Dislike and OK. The first time we listened there were a few dislikes. However after listening to it for 4 days I have to say there are no dislikes at all, more likes and still a few OKs. Its like running into an old friend you haven't heard from in 20 yrs. You're not sure if you'll still like each other until you get to know them again until you realize ""oh yea, this is why I liked them in the first place"". ""Hello, my friend hello""!!! I love this CD and glad I bought it no matter what format it is on."

2,"GOOD MUSIC, BAD CORPORATION!","Two of my favorite artists have put out brand new ""critically acclaimed"" albums. To my surprise I real love them both! Deep Purple's ""Rapture of the Deep"" and Neil Diamond's ""12 Songs"". Deep Purple's immense and clever brand of rock gets me through those long commutes, while Neil settles me down for the night. These two powerful albums really need to be played a number of times in order to reap the benefits. Both albums are strong statements that evoke a different kind of musical energy. So powerful, very ying and yang, you might say.As you may have noticed, we are having troubles with SONY. Beware of entering this disc into your computer. Sony, Sony, Sony...Boooooooooooo!Welcome back Neil and bravo Deep Purple!12 SONGS = 5 stars (SONY = O star)Rapture of the Deep = 5 stars"
1,WARNING!! This Sony Copyprotected CD can zap your computer,"Sony has been forced to stop production of CD's with their new copy protection which was designed to limit the number of copies you can make with your computer. This insidious software is ""stealthed"" onto your hard drive when you copy cd, this can allow knowledgeable hackers to piggy-back it to compromise the security of your computer!! Cant believe Amazon hasnt pulled these off their site. BEWARE Sony has CD's of a number of artist with this crud, DO NOT BUY SONY COPY PROTECTED CD's!!!"
1,Do not buy this or any other Sony CD!!!!!!,"Do not buy anything by Sony. This CD will secretly install copy-protection software on your PC that is a back door to hackers, worms and viruses of all types. Several class action lawsuits are already forming over this. I cannot imagine Neil Dimaond was not aware that this CD would be copy protected so unlike I lot of people I'm not sorry for him."
1,"Probably a Great Collection, but. . .","I will not buy this, or any other copy protected optical media. For one thing, calling this a CD is as illegal as violating music copyrights. I would never copy this or any other optical media for any purpose other than my own legal fair use, and probably not at all, but I will retain complete control over my own computers by not having software installed, possibly without my knowledge or knowing consent, that may render my systems unstable or unusable, and that I cannot detect and remove easily, and at will, with no after effects whatsoever."
2,Hell? Yeah,"Well Neil Diamond is in good voice here and at least is still writing. Whether he should be or not is another matter. This CD is destined to be a huge seller especially in countries with excellent facilities for the aged. Oh Mary at 5 minutes 13 is 3 minutes too long. Captain of a Shipwreck outdoes McCartney for whimsically banal lyrics. Save Me a Saturday Night is made for those who have long forgotten what Saturday nights used to be for. In Delerious Love Diamond finally finds second gear, but sadly the scenery is much too familiar for the ride to be interesting. The rest drones into a mellow grumbly mish mash that had my Mary saying put on something I can sing to. Thank God for copy protection - at least they have to give you a refund."
1,What no minus stars? Spyware!,I am totally outraged. I promise I will never buy anything made by Sony again. It's the least I can do. I wish there were more. I am telling everyone I know.
1,Copy Protection Nightmare for your PC!,Because this disc installs a rootkit that slows down your PC and makes your PC easy to hijack by hackers I am not going to order it. Sony and Neil Diamond can keep their Copy protected CD!
1,GREAT Music DO NOT BUY CD!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD -- DOWNLOAD THE MUSIC!I bought the CD before the release and after reading the great reviews. What a mistake! I'm one of those people who BUY CDs to put on my iPod, download songs via iTunes, and teach courses on copyright and multimedia so I know the rules and follow them. What Sony did for copy protection is EVIL - EVIL - EVIL. Go to iTunes and get the songs because you install the CD, your computer is wide open to attack AND it won't work on an iPod!Neil -- I think your music is great but Sony did you a great disservice! Tell them to quit fooling around with your CDs before you lose every fan that listens to your music on a PC, or loads it on a iPod."
1,This album is great; the CD encryption is criminal,"Allow me to drop a CD into my PC and PLAY IT!!! Is that so difficult?Sony -- people hate you, and this is why. I bought this because I love Neil Diamond...not because I wanted to rip you off. Way to turn the whole equation around -- without provocation. Not too many people could do that, but you were completely successful. Thanks for f-ing up a great listening experience. Is there a calendar in your office? Mine says 2005....apparently I'm off by about 20years.Sorry for Neil, Rick Rubin, and many other talented people whose names are associated with your piece of crap company. Stick to substandard electronics and leave music to the musicians please.Disgusted."
1,Probably Great -- but Who Can Tell?,"I am dying to hear this disc, but will not risk my computer due to the virus-prone copyright protection. You blew it, Sony!"
5,vailtrail.com/ weekly shuffle/ CD Review by Samantha Donen,"Neil Diamond,12 SongsAfter a long absence, Neil Diamond is back to inspire us to love again. Diamond's new album, 12 Songs, is at once deeply reflective as it is uplifting, from the somewhat melancholic ""Oh Mary"" to the exhilaration of ""Delirious Love."" Produced by the legendary Rick Rubin, who has worked with the likes of Johnny Cash and the Dixie Chicks, 12 Songs embraces the natural sounds of Diamond's acoustic guitar and vocals with the use of traditional instruments, like the Hammond organ. Web link: [...]."
1,Neil - where are you? Not anywhere on this album.,"Been a Neil Fan for many a year and a few concerts too. If you like the Neil Diamond 'big' sound, you're gonna be severely disappointed by this pile of garbage. The 'velvet' voice has changed to a croak. Worst piece of music I've ever purchased!!I've never wanted to return any music I've bought before, until I heard this bomb. Sorry Neil. Listen to some of the tracks before you buy this collection. It's definitely different."
1,Sony has gone too far,"I was so looking forward to the release of this album, but as a matter of principle, I will NOT purchase it. I sincerely hope that the disc buying public boycotts this and every disc which contains a copyright virus on it."
2,Oh Neil,"Well,I bought the CD at Walmart and downloaded it..I am not to happy with this CD ...I have had a collection of most of his works except the first couple CD's and beleive he has done much better work..These songs are to DRY!! Come on Neil this is not your better side..Please put some umph into your next cd..Like 3 chord opera or any of the many you have done..If, your use to a sexy,upbeat cd from Neil this is not what you want..I was really unimpressed.And I love most of his songs..Sorry,Sherlan"
2,Not his best,"Complaints about not being able to listen to the tracks before purchase are not viable. Go to Walmart Music Downloads, search for the album and listen away."
1,"Great Songs, Lousy Copy Protection","I love Neil Diamond, and the songs on this record deserve 5 stars, but Sony deserves zero stars. Beware of this CD. It contains copy protection in the form of a spyware like program that is installed deep into your computer. Getting rid of this program is an arduous task, even if you are an expert computer user.Second, if you want to place this CD onto your iPod, you can't. The copy protection prevents you from importing the songs into iTunes.Shame on Sony for being so underhanded and greedy that they punish honest fans and customers. I should be able to listen to the music I buy on whatever device I own."
1,This CD puts your computer at risk.,"This CD is infected with a copy protection Rootkit that can cause your computer to be unstable and can expose it to viruses and other unwanted things. There are numerous class action lawsuits currently working their way through the courts. If you won't want to wait, you can also sue Sony in small claims court. <a href=""http://www.sonysuit.com"">SonySuit.com</a> offers you the information you need to get started."
5,Best in a long time,"This is a crip, clear and well produced CD which gives you Neil's music for what he is. A songwriter. The song lyrics will make you smile, make you think, and some will break your heart. It is not ""get up and dance"" music, and if that's what your expecting you'll be dissapointed. What it is however is some of the best pieces he has written in years. You will get the clarity of Neil playing acoustic guitar, the sound of fingers moving over frets, and remarkable vocals.It is very different from many of his past works, but different can be a good thing. This is a great thing and well worth buying."
1,This recording has NOTHING TO do with the 1980s GARGOYLE!,"If you are looking for the classic 1980s metal act GARGOYLE --- DO NOT BUY THIS CD!I recently made the mistake of thinking that I was buying a classinc reissue (just look at the price) and was VERY VERY disappointed to discover that it was another artist that had chosen to ""rip off"" the name! Bummer! I was very disappointed to pay big bucks and discover that I'd been ""had!"""
4,Almost Perfect,"I will have to admit this album was not what I expected. I was thinking it was going to be more of a rock album. Having said that, I was blown away by Ryan's powerful vocals combined with his brilliant piano playing. You sort of have to be in a certain mood to want to listen to this one, but that's true for any type of music. The mood is darker. Anyway, yes I would recommend purchasing this one. I love this album and can't wait to see what's next for Mr. Star."
2,disappointed,"I first heard Ryan also several yrs ago with Stage, and was very impressed with the album and his voice, especially on ""Live Happy..."". However, based on his performance with Stage and his performances on Rock Star, I was expecting much more from this CD. He does still have a great and very unique voice, but this CD lacks in originality and diversity."
2,"Ryan Star ""Songs From the Eye of an Elephabt""","Not quite what I expected, very slow moving for my taste. However if I'm looking to listen to something mellow I would probably put this into the old CD player."
4,"Very, very good.","In fact, so good, that if there had only been 10-12 songs on the album, it would have been 5 stars.Sorry, Ryan, the album was way to long, and some songs almost lost their identity to the 3 count piano tags. But despite that, it's still an amazing album. Damn near brilliant.ADDITION:I reneg. This album should have 5 stars, but i can't figure out how to change the rating. Go buy the Stage album, too. Different taste, same flavor. MMM-mmm Good!"
4,"Nice, Melodic Album","I didn't think Ryan Star was a good fit for Rock Star Supernova based on his performances on the show, but I was curious enough to purchase his album. The album is slow and melodic, with the piano being the main instrument on most songs - so don't expect a pop album or a rock album if you purchase this. That said, I was actually quite pleasantly surprised by the quality of the song writing and found that I enjoyed the album quite a bit. Star has a good voice and the lyrics are clever. In some ways it's probably an album you have to be in the mood for to enjoy, but I give it a definite thumbs up."
4,"No, No is my song!","This was the first record that introduced me to the sax playing of George Howard, 'No No' was the jam!, George was one of the early 'smooth jazz' artists to get airplay on main R&B stations with this cd, sounded good then and now!"
3,Adequate Overview of Early Dregs,"This collection captures the first three albums of this Georgia hard-fusion, prog band. Given the lack of alternative collections out there, this one will have to do. Andy West's remarkable bass runs remain intact, and sound as great as ever. The ""hit"" Refried Funky Chicken is there, as is the wistful, romantic What If.That said, this great prog/jazz/fusion band deserves a better, more comprehensive collection. They did release a great deal of solid music after 1982, can someone please pull it all together and give these guys their due?"
3,Not there best but still good,I didn't like all the selections on this cd but its still worth getting just to hear Steve Morse and the band wail!
5,Hilarious! Dane Cook is so great!,"This is a must have! Dane Cook is one of the funniest comedians I have ever heard! Just great!I love how everyone who gives a bad review of this cd keeps refering to IQ, intellegence, ""newness to comedy"" or age. These are just opinions guys, lighten up! I don't like onions, but I would not call you stupid, immature or a ""newbie to food"" if you did. That is the beauty of diversity, and if those differences cannot be appreciated...I'd say that is the lack of intellegence here. If you don't like the cds, simply say so and move on...Ps. I happen to love these other comedians mentioned (as being intellegent) in the negative reviews as well. The irony is that if you listened to Dane Cook's interviews he mentions some of the same guys as his inspirations as he grew up and in to comedy himself. And those of you who negatively mentioned his screaming, must hate Sam Kinison, cause nobody screams out better comedy than that guy."
5,I work at the BK Lounge...,"for all you dane cook fans, it is always a laugh with any of his skits... i had a copy of this that i let my friend borrow and i never got it back, hmm i wonder why... i loved the jokes on this CD that i bought another copy... and to top it off, the DVD is the actual skit he did on comedy central.. so that is another plus... all Dane lovers need to buy this CD/DVD..."
2,Highly overrated.,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this guy, honestly. All my friends rave about how funny he is, yet I find his material boring, unfunny, and full of annoying/stupid sound effects. I also can't take how he carries jokes out WAY too long. My wife finds this crap hilarious yet she can't explain why. Maybe Dane is like that guy in highschool that all the girls thought was so funny and yet all the guys hated his guts?With so many talented, original and funny comedy CD's (mitch hedberg, david cross, mike birbiglia, todd barry, patton oswalt, etc.) I can't imagine why you'd waste your money on this CD."
5,BUY IT!!!,"Dane is hilarious. If you don't have this CD/DVD you need to get it. The CD is a great live performance that has my favorite bit on it, Un-Kool Aid. The DVD has two versions of his Comedy Central special, the original and the un-cut version. The original was funny but the un-cut is way better. I'm done, go buy Harmful if Swallowed right now or you stink."
3,Harmful if Swallowed by Dane Cook,Dane is one of the greatest comedians we have today. I have waited for months for this cd and I couldn't be happier. It was everything I had hoped for and more. I am only amazed that he is not a household name already.Go get it today or be boring forever!
5,It Rocked my skull right off!!!!,If you want to laugh from the beginning to the end...than dont sit here and read this...Go buy the cd right now!!! you will laugh your butt off!!!!You can listen to that cd over and over...i guarantee it!!! I have seen this guy live he is the best comic out there people...so hurry before it sells out....
5,What can you say?,"Dane Cook is the best of the best! He's hysterical!!! I never take his CD out of my car, and I watch the DVD so much I think the laser of my player's going to melt the disc. ;-) You ROCK! I can't wait for more!"
5,crazy comedy,The cd is 100% hysterical. There is overlap in the DVD but seeing it live is even funnier than hearing it. I will always remember Dane as the waffler from mystery men. great stuff.
5,Dane Cook is a Legend,"Dane Cook is the best young comedian in the World today. I have seen him Live in Dublin, where he blew Denis Learys reputation to shreds and have listened to his Cd's many times. Just buy them both, he delivers solid comedy performances, no more promotion required, this guy is the real deal."
5,Funny!!,"I found Dane Cook's Harmful if Swallowed CD on accident about 6 months ago and laughed harder than I've ever laughed before. I don't really find comedians that funny, but Dane Cook just hits the right chords in me to make me laugh. His BK Lounge skit is the number one reason I bought the CD set. It's great. Pick it up!"
4,Dane Cook is Awesome,"Dane Cook is awesome. He keeps you on the edge of your seat laughing the entire time and the thing is, he tells it like it is. I can't wait to get his next CD that is coming out. I first Dane while in Tech School for the Air Force and I have come to find there are a ton of people that like him. I hope he comes around for a tour around here, 'cause I'd love to seem him live. This is an awesome buy and a great price because you not only get the CD but the DVD as well. Dane is the man!!!~~"
1,NOT FUNNY AT ALL,"Dane Cook is one the most popular comedians of today so I decided to check his comedy out. Now I know that our current state of pop culture (music, tv ect) is pretty terrible so I was thinking that Cook might not be as funny as all the hype made him out to be, but expected something at least decent. After hearing this CD, I think Dane Cook's comedy should be illegal. This was one of the least funny things I've ever heard in my life. A couple of times I smirked and maybe cracked a smile but seriously the only time I actually laughed was during the Kool Aid rountine. This stuff is horrible."
5,Just buy it.,"The DVD rocks. Found Dane Cook on Comedy Central and immediately bought it. This dude is nuts. Haven't bought a comedy CD for years but this had to be done. The drive-through will never be the same again. You'll end up laughing later on just remembering bits and pieces.P.S. There you go, Dane. Keep doing what your doing. That makes 69. heh."
2,Some Funny - Some Not,"Sorry to spoil the great run of reviews, but I just don't find Dane all that funny. He's got some great lines, but as a whole I thought the DVD sucked. The CD is better because the tracks blend together better, but I won't only recommend this box set to those who know they like Mr. Cook. Also, about 1/2 the material on the set is available free on the Dane Cook website."
3,"More hot air , than brilliance","I buy i lot of stand comedy [cd's & dvd's].After reading such glowing reviews for this item i decided to part with some more cash. I was fairly disappointed, given that this cd has so many people raving about it. Granted some material was clever, Cook seems to rely more on animated delivery that genuinely intelligent material. Probably will appeal to people with an I.Q. somewhere in the middle to lower regions."
5,HAHAHA,"Some people hate him, i find it funny. One of my first purchases and I was nervous but it came as described and saved me money, couldn't be happier!"
4,Misleading of some nature,"Well, i won't make this long. Dane Cook is very good comedian- one of my all time favorite, his jokes are straight forward, and everyone ca relate to them. This Dvd is no exception and does not fall short of Dane Cook's amazingness. BUT, i was disappointed that the DVD isn't his actual show that's on the CD. For that i give this purchase of mine 2 thumbs down"
4,A STAR IS BORN,"Dane's charisma is unmistakable. he is a new version of Chevy Chase - and the best of Chevy. The material has improved over the years - he's a bit stuck in some responses from the audience but his acting style, good looks, and endearment to the audience are the quality of a star is born. A very entertaining hour and more of a brilliant comedian who will not be spoilt by the the mess that others in his situation were. Dane has a strength and resolve that indicate he will be around for a long time."
3,Thought it would be funnier.,"After seeing Dane Cook's Vicious Circle, and 312 reviews averaging 5 starts here on Amazon, I expected this CD/DVD to be funnier. Dane is funny, and some parts were stomach hurting funny, but all in all, I expected more. After listening to the CD, I watched the unedited Comedy Central Special on the DVD and was disappointed that most of the material was the same as on the CD."
5,Dane Cook Is King,"This is by far the Best comedy Cd I have ever heard! Dane Cook puts the ""ha ha ha"" in funny! I laughed so hard milk shot out of my nose. (which is really kind of weird, because I wasn't drinking milk) The DVD rocks too!!"
1,moronic,"does walking fast around a stage make anything this guy says funny? no; it's a lot of like this man and more ancient baloney- wait, more fast walking- and like he told me this- wait, we're walking again, and we've all had this thing, right (audience silence), but a lot more walking around fast"
3,Dane Cook's First Chance to Shine,"Dane Cook is a brilliant comedian that has played on stages all across the country. Looking at his website you can see live performances of him on such shows as The Best Damn Sports Show Period and Live with Carson Daly. He has crude, blunt humor that is for the most part exteremely accurate. Whether talking from his BK Lounge or to his Kool-Aid Man, Dane Cook is one of the newest and funniest guys on the comedy scene. This CD is a great album, and what makes me feel that the next album, if he so choses to have one, will be much the same, and maybe better."
3,Alright look...,"Let's face it, 5'9"" is the most underrated MC in the game. He's also the most clever, he continues to show that everytime he spits. However this album leaves something to be desired. For any diehard Royce fan like myself, I say go ahead and get the album, you will appreciate it but it is not his best work by any means. For somebody who has never heard Royce's music, I recommend Rock City or Death is Certain. Like I said, this album is not great, it's just ok. I have all of his albums and this would be my least favorite one."
4,Funky Dance Music,"Ladies and Gentlemen, from the East Bay, Vallejo California we present Con Funk Shun. One of the better funk dance music bands in the early 80's, with a good combination of funk and dance. Not as funky as George Clinton and Parliment, and not as danceable as disco, but nevertheless a great combination without being too funky. You can kick back and listen to it, or get out and boogie.""Got to Get Enough"" was one of the bigger singles off this album and one of my favorites. You haffta to get up and dance to that."
4,Con Funk Shun cd,I'm not the best reviewer but I bought the Con Funk Shun cd because of the ballad Love's Train. The ballad Straight From the Heart is awesome! I was young when that song came out. It made me want to experience what love is. Felton Pilate's tenor voice sounds so beautiful! It kind of reminds me of the Temptations' Eddie Kendricks. I really love those songs! The uptempo songs like Chase Me are good as well.
3,a somewhat dated story of a family,"This is the story of a nineteenth century German family and their sorrows. It contains the prejudices of the time, such as that against the profession of actress, and also has one of the most selfish characters I have read about in some time. She (Martha) is portrayed as being unable to escape her ""unfortunate"" heritage, and comes to a predictable end. Not a great book, but an interesting read. As for ""Under the Muses' Ban"", also included in this volume, it is the story of the ultimate self-sacrifice of a woman (she gives up her true love to another) for the happiness of another, and the results of that happiness. A sad tale, but better written and more engaging than ""Martha, The Parson's Daughter"", in my opinion."
2,Side grass catch,"I purchase this product because my side discharge mower bag was on it last leg. I receive this bag two days early,it arrive as describe by the vender. The bag material is impressive and the metal attachment for mower handle is of heavy duty material. However, after the first use and many trial there after, the bag continue to clog. I had to stop mowing to un-clog this bag over and over again. This type of bag curves and attaches to the mower handle. If you have a side discharge mower stay away from this type of bag. Use a bag that attaches to the side mower chute, and extent straight outward away from mower."
1,Comedy,"I love Rodney Dangerfield, but the audio was so bad, that I never finished listening to it. I should have returned it."
3,Sound Quality Poor,It has his first No respect joke on it. He says a lot of classic things on it. The sound was too low. He sounds as if he is mumbling.I wish someone would compile his standup from his 70 appearances on the Tonight Show.
3,stick with No Respect.,This is another live performance of Mr. Dangerfield's. There was much overlap in the material from No Respect. Still if one is a big fan it is worth having.
5,How exciting!,I am so so so so so so excited to see this coming to DVD! I love it and can't wait till september! Bring on the rest of the seasons! Now!
5,I Love Dick Van Dyke!,"I have never seen Dick Van Dyke in a bad role. Some are better than others, but he always plays the role perfectly. In Diagnosis Murder, he plays a doctor who helps solve crimes. Van Dyke's real-life son, Barry, plays his television son, who is a policeman. This is a fun series and the cast is very nearly perfect. In the third season, Jack is gone and Jessie shows up, but both are likeable and so you don't mind. This is a good crime story for people who aren't into (or just want a break from) all the gory, bizarre, CSI type shows. It's good clean fun with a guy who remains young-at-heart and just plain loveable."
4,Really awesome,"I find this album quite tasteful, not lacking or overdoing anything. its a fine piece of work, though i would like a less monotonous vocal melodies.however,,i do find it a stupid comment when someone says that grunts,growls,etc are fur people with bad taste in music. everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion and anyone who speaks like that is surely close minded and narrow."
5,Can't Get Enought of this CD!,"Again, Can't get enough of this CD - I listen to it all the time. This is one of the Hottest Tribal House CDs Ever! Victor's BEST So Far, only thing better is LIVE!"
4,View from the inside,"An intriguing collection of essays by those on the autistic spectrum(AS). The editor has deliberately resisted overediting of the essays so the AS style of thinking and wording comes through. The writers mostly focus on their college and young adult years and the problems with finding friends and employment. Life poses many difficulties, even for higher functioning AS people with college degrees. They have academic and job skills, but the social differences pose a significant barrier.A relative of mine found this book helpful in giving insight to how some AS people perceive and encounter the world. This book might also be helpful to AS teenagers and young adults to help them realize a commonality of experience.I am amazed by the explosion of books on Aspergers and autistic spectrum disorders. Until recently, there were only a few books available with the ""inside"" perspective of autism, such as by Temple Grandin. I welcome the contribution of others' perspectives."
1,Doesn't work if you're a lefty,"Completely useless if you use your left hand to slice bread. Ah, how we southpaws must live in a right-centric world."
5,Great guide for the novice or more advanced user,"If you are at all interested in the potential for delivering video over the internet today and in the near future, this is an excellent resource. With it, you'll understand all you need to do to create, prepare, host and deliver video in compelling ways... and what NOT to do as well. It's well-laid out, full of clear explanations and examples, and is very well written for a variety of experienc levels.Mr. Stolarz knows his stuff and the book is well worth the money."
1,deception,It is not a guide to streaming as indicated. It is more a video transmission history. I have the equipment. I was looking for a streaming software guide.
2,"A mediocre release, at best","Henry Cowell was an American original. His music was sometimes brilliant and innovative. Often it was tepid and missing the mark. This disc certainly falls into the latter category. Cowell obviously struggled with the symphonic form. The two symphonies on offer here are lackluster and offer nothing worth remembering. A failed attempt at tonality with little or no organic development. Production is good as can be expected seeing that only 7 of the 63 minutes on the disc were recorded in stereo. For this era of Cowell's output, the discs on Koch do far better justice. For a truly ambitious and unique Cowell disc, search out the disc on Col Legno titled ""American Piano Concertos"". I had higher hopes for this disc, but knowing that I'd never listen to it again, I gave my copy to a friend. Maybe he'll find something in it that I missed."
4,Amazon Kindle Books on Choices on the paths we walk,Good reminder to stick to the plan when things look bleak and stay on the path to complete the Kings Quest. Some villainy trickery here.
2,A good book Claire P2/R2,"This book is about an orphan named Tree who gets adopted for a year so he can help a small family called the Gundersons on their farm. Tree does not not want to go at first because ha doesn't want to leave his younger brother, Acorn, behind. Tree than decidedif he works hard enough for the Gundersons they might keep him and decide to also adopt Acorn. Tree tries his hardest but he can never seem to please Mr. Gunderson even after befriending his brother Jake. But with the help of Jake will Tree ever be able to get adopted?You'll love this book if like to read historical fiction. Even though I didn't like this book that much, I think the author has a very unique way of writing that makes you want to keep reading the book until you finish it."
5,An empathetic view of orphans,"Jake's Orphan, by Peggy Brooke, is excellent historical fiction. What grabs the reader throughout the entire book is the use of language. Brooke has taken time to find the right metaphor, exact word, the poignant phrase to express the emotions of the character. She definately shows, and never tells. The plot is fresh and unprdictable. Layers of meaning exist in every chapter, pulling the reader deeper and deeper into the life of Tree, Acorn and Jake. Characterization is clear cut and well executed. A must read for boys especially. Any history buff of tween years will enjoy learning about life in North Dakota during the early part of this century. A five star book."
2,WHY A REVIVAL ?,"I APPRECIATED THE THOMPSON FILM FOR ITS GENUINE TENSION WHILE I HAVE FELT REAL DISGUST FOR THE SCORSESE REVIVAL WHICH, WITH ITS SPECIAL EFFECTS, SWEARING AND VIOLENCE, HAS ONLY DISTURBED ME. THE CAST SOUNDS COMPLETELY FALSE AND BOTHERSOME. LANGE IS IRRITATING. DE NIRO, EVEN IF PARTICULARLY ABLE, GIVES THE IDEA OF A SELF-COMPLACENCY IN ACTING LIKE THAT. I NOW REGRET HAVING BOUGHT THIS SET. THE THOMPSON FILM WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR MY COLLECTION.ERNESTO OPPICELLI - GENOVA CERTOSA - ITALY"
2,"Cheap toy, not worth the price","I was so disappointed in this product upon receipt. I thought that my preschooler would have yet another fun game that he could play after Christmas. Not so, it was cheaply made and he is very hard on toys. This had the potential to be a great idea, if the toy manufacturer would hve executed this idea better. My suggestion: don't waste your hard earned dollars."
1,Mater Rollin Bowl,It looked a lot better in the picture and I thought I was getting a quality toy. This is the first purchase that I have been disappointed with. When you send the car towards the pins it just drops off the other end. The cardboard and plastic sides are cheap and flimsy.
5,"fabulous book, great holistic vet!","I read about this book in our local newspaper, and after reading it, was so enthralled by Dr. Kelleher and her effective methods of curing ""incurable"" problems with animals, I discovered, to my delight, that she practices in Seattle, where I live! I finally managed to get an appointment in her very busy practice, and my two elderly cats and I have been going to see her regularly ever since! She is a Godsend, and a miracle worker. She has managed, through acupuncture, chiropractic, and herbal remedies, to help what has been diagnosed as ""kidney failure"" in one cat, and has completely eradicated a serious skin condition in the other one, that traditional vets could not do anything to help. I buy several of these books at once, and give them to all my friends, especially those who are struggling with pet problems that are not being solved by traditional veterinarian medicine. I highly recommend this book to every caring pet owner!"
5,Stunning Classic Blues,"D Max plays some of the best blues piano you will hear in this world and maybe the next. If you like REAL blues, see him live."
5,THE BEST,"The Wild Boyz are so crazy! The stuff they do is sooo rad! I can't belive some of the stuff they do! I'd say they should keep doing their crazy stunts, and not do weak stunts. But they have never done a weak stunt! Thats what i like about them."
1,Nothing new here... and still censored!,"Wildboyz is a fun show and I enjoy watching it on television. However, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason to buy this dvd collection if you subscribe to MTV. The dvd is not uncensored... there's nothing here that you haven't heard or seen on TV. Same old bleeped out words. Same old censored video. Save your money!!!"
2,its okay i guess,"i guess buy this when you get sick of the viva la bam and cky dvds. its pretty good here and there, i got a couple chuckles out of it. basically, they just get hurt by animals the whole time. and nothing else."
5,even a little educating...,"This show is fun to watch and can even teach a few things about nature. This show is not over the top like Jackass and Viva la Bam, but it is crazy, because you don't really know what's going to happen when you jump in the water with a Great White Shark. The animals don't act or play to the camera which is what makes it somewhat educating. You learn that even some of the nicest animals can still hurt you, and that some of the most vicious animals are not always so dangerous. I'm not saying to watch this because you will learn something, I just say watch it because it's funny and you don't know how the animals will react to what's happening; therefore teaching you at the same time what you shouldn't do around certain animals, even though you probably will never come into contact with most of the animals on the show. So watch and learn."
5,Crocodile Hunter take a number!,"For $20 you get the full first season of one of the most hilarious nature shows The Wild Boyz.... for $20 you get an hours worth of unseen footage, not even including all the bloopers, all the extra features, and the commentary tracks which are just as hilarious and entertaining as the show itself... ALL FOR $20 FREAKIN DOLLARS! Finally a show jumps into the Nature TV world and teaches us something while making us laugh our asses off! Watch Chris and Steve-O get mauled by bears, sharks, birds and any other creature they can rounge up, and trust me, for $20 you getting a lot of bang for your buck... by this ish!"
5,White Mansions & Jessie James,"This is an excellent CD. My basic purpose for this review is to help out those wanting this CD. It was reissued in 99' by mercury in a two CD set, the second CD being ""The Legend of Jessie James"" featuring Levon Helm, Johnny Cash, Charlie Daniels, Emmylou Harris, Albert Lee, and others. Paul Kennerly wrote the music for both. The Jessie James story is told in 17 tracks from the prewar Redleg terror, through the guerilla fighting under Quantrill, the postwar robberies and Jessies assasination. The 20 page color booklet with photos and the entire history of both albums is excellent. The numbers are (314-540 791-2)set / (314-540792-2)White Mansions /(314-540 793-2)The Legend of Jessie James I know the set is available as it was given to my neighbor as a gift in spring 2001, good luck!"
2,"Appalling. Really, really bad.","After some thought, I was able to narrow down the problems with this album to two. Firstly, it's supposed to represent the viewpoints of (primarily) Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. But it doesn't do so. It uses images of ""rednecks"" and ""southern boys"" which belong to the late 20th century. It's in no way an accurate ""period"" piece. But... after all, that might be asking too much from a country CD, right? Well... unfortunately, the lyrics are also really, really dumb. They're obvious, badly rhymed, and stupid (one song features the mispronunciation of ""cavalry"" as ""calvary""). The one cool track, Bring Up The Twelve Pounders, is only a few seconds long. Skip it!"
5,emmylou fans!,"she appears on several tracks on the ""South's"" disc <g>. where else would you expect to find a Red Dirt Girl ??"
5,Nostalgia,"I first heard this album over 20 years ago and used to listen to it a lot when my children were little. Over the years and after much use, the album disappeared. I was so happy to find that a copy is still available. I've ordered the CD but would also be interested in a cassette. Would it be possible to purchase one?"
4,Really good,"This book covers everything you need to know about VSAM & IDCAMS. You should be at least semi-familiar with JCL and TSO/ISPF. The focus is on utility, skipping a few things you would never do anyway. The only negative thing is that the peripheral subjects are very out of date (ie:It helps to know that DFP was the predecessor to DF/SMS). It has wonderful examples that are clear and easy follow. Each example is shown 3 ways: 1. From the TSO command line 2. In OS(MVS) JCL 3. In DOS JCL(does anyone still use this?). While the book could stand an update, it is still very useful."
4,These new and old series are terrific!,"Way to go, Bonnie Bryant! I am writing this with my two friends, Michelle and Stacey. We all love the Saddle Club, and now Pine Hollow! We all ride together near Toronto, Ontario. I think you should bring back the horse-stuff into Pine Hollow, but that doesn't mean I don't like how they are growing up. Please!!!! Tell us what's happening with A.J.! Don't forget the horses, or Ben Marlow. One thing though, could you please have Stevie and Lisa being involed at the stable, cause it's not just Carole who is horse-crazy! We're from Canada, so it'd be really cool if Carole , Stevie, Lisa (and maybe Alex) could take a trip and come 'up here'. Anyways, thanks for writing, we love it! And viewers, if you want to send in your opinion, be nice! Keep writing B.B., cause we'll keep buying! Krysta, Michelle, and Stacey. (Lisa, Carole, and Stevie)"
3,confirmation faults,"If I have a quibble with the series (and the Saddle Club one), it's that Phil is just too perfect a boyfriend to be believable. And Alex is just too dull, despite his possessiveness. However, the other male main characters are better drawn, more human and imperfect.In this book, Lisa is worrying because Max isn't letting anyone ride Prancer (who's pregnant with twins). Carole is obsessed with training a new horse and is neglecting her own. Callie is trying to be a better friend to her old friend Sheila from home, but it turns out that this isn't such a swift move."
5,A GOOD BOOK!,"I liked this book... I'm enjoying the new series too, I only wish the books would be published faster...Anyhow,is that supposed to be Ben Marlow on the cover? I think it is... I wish this book told what is wrong with A.J. instead of leaving me hanging... Oh well, I guess I'll have to wait for no.6 to come out. I wonder when Bonnie Bryant will decide to merge the Saddle Club into Pine Hollow... It has to happen eventually... they can't stay young forever... She'll probably stop at like book#150 or something, and then turn the story over into Pine Hollow... probably when Lisa's parents divorce... That is just my prediction for the future anyways... Kepp it up B.B! =)"
2,I HATE this series!,"I hate this new series--it's ruined everything. I agree with the girl from Sydney, because the Saddle Club series is so much better. How could my favorite series be ruined by this...? I appreciate Ms. Bryant trying to make a series for teens, but really--this isn't working. She ought to make something a lot like the Saddle Club adventures--just with them being older and the books more advanced. And more about HORSES! At least the one before this had a little more of horses, though. This is not a boy-crazy series, it is a horse-crazy series. HELLO!I am starting my own series now. Good bye."
4,A Book That was a Little too much Like a Soap-Opera,"I thought that the story line was great,but the actual story was a bit sketchy.I first stasrted reading Pine Hollow books when I learned that it involved the Saddle Club's main characters.(Stevie,Lisa,and Carole)Ben seemed like a nice guy and he seems a little shy.Carole is way too obsessed with Samson,the horse, and only Ben seems to notice.When he tries to bring to her suposedly best friends' attention they ignore him and treat him like dirt.I couldn't get over how Stevie talked about if he weren't so weird he'd be happier.Give me a break!I really liked Callie's character although her brother,Scott, had the better judgement.Her refusal to give up was the best quality.All in all the book was pretty good.Bonnie Bryant is and always will be a great author,but the characters are way too shallow,selfish, and uncaring.Lisa is the main example."
3,Conformation faults,This book was quite good- ties up some loose ends. However as the book progresses I started to hate Carole more and more. She would have to be the most annoying character. Also I think that information from saddle club books should be the same in Pine Hollow. An example is the problem with prancer- we were told that this would never happen.
5,Jimmy Review,"This cd is awesome, and I love Jimm'ys voice. He is truly talented, and his songs are very heartfelt! I love it!"
5,Jimmy Wayne..the next big thing,"I've been anticipating this CD since I saw him a year or so ago at the Bluebird. He is an incredible songwriter, singer and so very sweet. We love you Jimmy..will see you soon.Cindy"
5,Excellent!,"This cd is excellent! I love ""Stay Gone"". If you are looking for a great cd, you've found it! He is soon to be a household name!"
5,Jimmy is hear to stay!,"Just by listening to the first single from Jimmy Wayne's self titled album, you can tell he has a story to tell.This is even before you hear and read of all the heartache he suffered as a young person.Then, when you actually buy the album and hear such songs as ""I love you this much"", its apparent just how much talent and how much of a survivor Jimmy Wayne really is.The whole disc is great, lyrically, aswell as musically.Jimmy will not be one of these fads that come and go, he has staying power and the music has proven it can complete with the best of them!"
4,Great album!,"Great debut album from the N.C. native. Featuring the Top 3 hit single ""Stay Gone"" about two people that are in a relationship and know they love each other but no matter how hard they try they know their relationship is just not going to work out. This album ranges from up-beat tunes like ""The Rabbit"" to a heart felt ballad ""Are You Ever Gonna Love Me?"" and the beautifully written ""Paper Angels,"" a song about Christmas time, the spirit of giving and those less fortunate. Jimmy Wayne shows much emotion and soul in this album, it's a must have for any country music fan!"
5,Jimmy Wayne will be the newest country star,"Jimmy Wayne is the newest country music singer and my opinion is that he will be the greatest star for country music to come. He has a fantastic voice which over powers the others. He sings with that traditional country sound that country music has lost. Go ahead, buy this album because it will probably reach #1 in no time!"
4,Jimmy Wayne,"Jimmy wayne is new to the country music scene-and he proves that he has what it takes to make a lasting impression here!! He is one of the few new artists to come around with such an honest,heartfelt approach to delivering his songs.Jimmy is definitely the guy to look out for. There's no doubt we will be hearing much more from him in the future!!!!"
3,not quite as good as I expected,"So I really like the first 3 songs on this album, and a couple of the other ones are fairly good, but after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon I was expecting it to be utterly fantastic....and honestly its not quite that. Like I said the first 3 are great...After You, Are You Ever Gonna Love Me?, and Stay Gone. Some other okay ones are Trespassin, You Are, and The Rabbit. I think one of my major complaints is the fact that the songs are kind of on the shorter side. You just start getting into it and then it ends. I would like to see Jimmy in concert cause I think he would have more freedom to play around with the songs than he had while producing his first disc. I'm sure that he will be around for awhile cause I definitely think he'll only improve with another album cause he has talent and a lot of potential he just needs another opportunity to show all he has learned since recording this one."
3,Decent country album,"I think that the first three songs on the album are the best ones, and i like how Jimmy Wayne doesn't do the traditional cowboy hat country because that kind of country just gets on my nerves. The music can be touching since it seems so biographical, but i gave it a three because i'm only getting into a few songs on the CD and the rest really aren't that good to me! But it's still a decent buy for a country fan who's looking for something new!"
2,"Another example of Nashville's current identity crisis, circa 2003","Yawn. Overproduced, overly wordy, prettyboy country. Wayne has an okay voice, but he doesn't seem fully in control of his product, and has an unfortunate penchant for needlessly elaborate, stagily pseudo-intellectual material, like ""True Friends,"" a song about two childhood friends who meet in jail -- one's a prison guard, and the others a convict -- and ""Papers Angels,"" a shamelessly sentimentalized issue song about abducted children. Oh, and then there's also ""I Love You This Much,"" a weeper about some guy trying to get close to his distant dad, complete with swelling string sections and gushing vocals. Yawn, again. Memo to Nashville: can we just agree to keep the predictable, made-for-Dr. Phil, sensitive-guy, psychobabble songs down to a minimum, at least from here on? Maybe add a little twang from time to time as well? Thanks. (Axton)"
3,a good start,"I love Wayne's first single Stay Gone. The first four songs of the album (which includes Stay Gone) are true to this vein. From that point the songs take a decidely preachy tone, and by the last four songs of the album I have to shut it off. I expect songs to have emotion, and I have no problem with spirituality, but don't use music to preach. If you want someone who tackles the same life situations and emotions without become maudlin try out Brian McComas."
5,Jimmy Wade-A Star is Born,"Jimmy is one of the brightest upcoming stars I know. He's very personable & he can sing great. These two things combined make a superstar. If you want to hear a wonderful singer & person, please go purchase anything by Jimmy Wade right now."
5,From the heart,"I picked up this CD after seeing Jimmy Wayne live in concert recently, just him and a guitar - it was absolutely breathtaking!! I can tell he poured a lot of his heart into this CD as well, the songs are melancholy and touching, especially ""Are You Ever Gonna Love Me"", ""Stay Gone"" and ""I Love You This Much"", and the moving ""Paper Angels"" hit me hard. But he also cuts loose and has fun on songs like ""After You"" and ""Trespassin'"". The last two songs close the album with a bang - ""You're the One I'm Talking To"" hints about what a plastic society we've become and ""The Rabbit"" warns ""we'll have to answer for the things we've done."" What an awesome debut CD - it should be in everyon's collection"
1,not what we expected,"My son loves cars, trucks, motorcycles and all, but this movie was a big dissapointment. It's a cheesy film that dosen't hold the intrest of our child. I gave it away, thank god is wasn't that exspensive."
1,boring,"Pay heed to the New Yorker's review above--this is so drab and dull my husband and I didn't finish it. The tone is confused and the spots of melodrama undermine both the sinister aspects and the parts that would be funny. The characters are merely grotesque and impossible to either sympathize with, or despise. Also, the plot moves forward largely because everybody--including the ""young poisoner"" himself--is a moron. Hard to find something to like here."
4,"great flik, sh*tty transfer!!!","i recently purchased a dvd copy of this for $10-. MY OLD VHS COPY LOOKS BETTER THAN THIS TRANSFER. if you still have a vcr at home then do yourself a favor, buy a vhs copy & enjoy... otherwise, this is a great movie w/ lots of style & a nasty sense of humor!!! would be 5 stars if not for the lack-luster, seemingly 3rd generation video tape transfer picture quality... this movie deserves a proper dvd release(i.e. picture restoration, orig. aspect ratio, sound restoration, etc.) WATCH IT!!!"
4,"Another Cow's Dead, my review from Barcelona","One of the best Blues and Blues-Soul record I ever heard whit a grand guitar a perfect voice for the situation and a marvelous horn section with The Blues Brothers Horns plus One...in this EDDIE KING's ""Another Cow's Dead"" record where there are seven wonderful originals and five superb covers. Classicals Blues like the open track 'Kitty Kat' with spectacular riffs and great guitar solos, fantastic ""Yonders Wall"" what a superb Blues, the slow ""Another Cow Dead Tonight"" catching as the majoriry of these kind of Blues, another jewel ""Walk Right On In"", the funny and fast ""Pocketful of Blues"", the R&B ""If loving you is wrong"",and the magnificient ""Angel of Mercy"" cover with Albert Collin's ways; the remainder of LP is full of prominent BLUES-SOUL. A record to enjoy I give it 4 stars."
5,BRILLIANT BLUES,"Another great blues guitarist / singer / songwriter. There are many outstanding features to this CD. Great vocals ( think a mix of PERCY SLEDGE / ALBERT COLLINS ), great songs ( 7 orignals and 5 covers ), one of the best horn sections ever on a blues / soul CD ( the BLUES BROTHERS HORNS plus ONE ), brilliantly arranged by BLUE LOU MARINI, good to great guitar work ( great on the slower tracks ) and an infectious sense of humour. Sure to get your party started. If you like the blues ( traditional or electric ) you will like this."
3,My introduction to Freddie Hubbard,"I may give that 3 or 3.5 stars to go just in case I felt enuff to make it like I did the last CD I purchased was ""Harry James: The Silver Collection"". There's isn't much I had to say about it but theres only 4 tracks to this CD instead of 5 or 6. Wish it has more tracks to this. Freddie Hubbard is sure is my main trumpet player I adore listening 'cuz of his sounds and comparisons to Miles Davis, Donald Byrd, Clifford Brown, Clark Terry, just to name a few. He'd worked all around the world I mean he was all of the above from Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Stanley Turrentine, Quincy Jones, Donald Byrd, Art Blakey, John Coltrane, among others.The best song to date from either ""Melting Pot"" or ""Life Flight"". I had a hard time struggling each one. Maybe the next 1 time when I buy it, I'll decide. Well job done."
3,Mediocre,"Robert Randolph & The Family Band is growing larger in popularity, so I guarantee you the record company got more involved with Colorblind and the result is this over produced mediocrity. ""Hey Rob, big guy, the trades are already screamin' smash, but you need more guest stars and yeah, use this producer too, we need a bigger sound."" I sure hope Randolph doesn't fall into that cliche' again when it comes to the 4th CD.If you haven't heard their first two CD's or never seen them live, then yes, you will like Colorblind. If you have Unclassified or Wetlands, or better yet seen this band live, then this CD will be a disapointment. ""Deliver Me"" is the lone song that reaches the same energy and overall level of music of their first two CD's. The ""guest stars"" are a tacked on sales pitch to sell more CDs without offering any better quality than the Family Band can produce on their own.Colorblind is a dissapointment to this Robert Randolph fan."
3,CD,I had never heard of this band until I saw it featured on So You Think YouCan Dance program. So I decided to order it and hear the whole song and CDThe CD isn't bad but the song Ain't Nothing Wrong With That is the reason I ordered the CD and I was not disappointed.
4,better than the first one,"I got his first cd and it was good but not that great but the new one is very good song for song, it has a lot more edge and more whip to it, the songs are fast and move from the get go and the slow songs are smooth.'jesus is just alright' make's this cd the song rocks with eric clapton ,'Deliver me ' is that whip I was talking about, 'Diane' is good also with some catchy words 'Angels' is the that smooth I talked about .this is good ."
2,A little disappointed,"I was trying something new and this album was recommended. It has some good hits on it but I guess it just wasn't what I was looking for, which was more of a Jimmy feel. I'll try it again in a month and see how it does me."
4,Contains 13 Stories With Original Illustrations,"Contains all the popular Beatrix Potter Stories, plus a few less known. Contents are The Tale of Peter Rabbit, The Tailor of Gloucester, The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin, The Tale of Bejamin Bunny, The Tale of Two Bad Mice, The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, The Pie and the Patty-Pan, The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher, The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit, The Story of Miss Moppet, The Tale of Tom Kitten, The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck and The Roly-Poly PuddingThe book has two or three original illustrations on each page, so Peter Rabbit only takes 9 pages. A pretty good collection for the price -- though some of these stories are pretty forgettable."
2,Not my phone of choice,"I didn't find this phone to be user friendly. After I got it set up, which was not terribly complicated, I found that it was almost impossible to read the display on both the phone and the digital time display. I looked in the directions for ways to fix this problem and couldn't find anything relevant. I tried to adjust the contrast but it didn't make a big difference. I ended up buying another company's phone and it works much better and has caller ID waiting as well."
1,don't bother,"this looked like just the thing i needed - fulfilled all my ""wants"" - problem was, when it arrived, NOTHING worked on it. Just a hunk of plastic - totally useless. Save yourself the grief and keep looking."
2,well made but hard to use,I was hoping that this product would meet my needs. While it appears to be well made I found it hard to use. All 3 LCD dsiplays are difficult to see unless held at a very narrow angle of vision. Even adjusting the contrast didn't help much. The AM/FM radio tuner is very sensitive and hard to tune in to the desired stations.
2,Disppointed,"I've been looking for a clock radio/telephone locally and couldn't find one so shopped on line and found the CID502. Sounded like just what I wanted. However....the clock display is black on gray and very hard to see during the day. At night, without my glasses it was impossible to read. Usually, these displays are red or green and much more visible.Also, the radio dial was very touchy. I kept going past the station I wanted, then I'd reverse and go past it again. Very frustrating so after one day I sent it back.I'm still looking for a good clock/radio/telephone.C. H."
4,"Overall great, minor complaints","Overall the product is great, the clock is a little hard to read on my night stand I have to shield it from any light and the directions for setting the alarm a little unclear, but after I figured them out no problems. Sound is good and cd great. The lighting on the caller id needs to be brighter."
1,The worst product I have ever bought,"I paid nearly $100 for this unit a year ago (not through Amazon), and it has been a cheaply made disappointment in nearly every way. The display is unreadable and impossible to adjust. I wrote Conair and never heard from them. I'm glad to see that this item is out of production. DO NOT buy one from any seller!"
1,Poor reception,"The phone does not work well on this unit, there is terrible static on the line. Its starts up ok when you make a call but 2 seconds after it sounds like there is a fax machine on and goes on and on until you can't hear the person on the other end."
4,conair,Tough learning how to set time and still can't get blinking red light to turn off but all in all a great investment. The #8 won't light up but that is the only thing I found wrong with the phone. Didn't even noticed it had a cd player with it---that was a plus
2,Phone/CD/Radio,"Bought this about 5 years ago. It's now been replaced. It worked well for a year or so. The caller ID was hard to read. The radio reception never was good, then it died, C/D player died, then caller id died. Kept it for a spare phone in the bedroom for awhile."
2,everthing didn't work,"Everthing worked fine except for the caller ID. I didn't like the lighting for the clock either. If the caller ID had a light, it didn't work. Other than that it works fine."
3,Not Too Bad....,"I got this bag for my 14 in iBookG4....It lasted for about 10 months without any problems, then the faux leather material near where the strap is connected to the bag began to rip. It continued to do so untill the leather dissapeared from the area...but with a little electrical tape it has held together fine. The bag itself is wonderful, and sturdy, it will protect your computer from being dropped or kicked, or steped on...it's really amazing, for those of you who take public transit (the ""T"" in Boston) you know how rough it can be, and this bag stood up to it all. It was a little big for my liking, but it held a lot. You can fit a textbook, your laptop, your Lunch, your drink, and your cellphone, plus a few other assorted things in this bag all at the same time. I liked this bag, but it does have it's downfalls."
1,WRONG PICTURE FOR ITEM!,"the picture for this product is of a small, two-blade Buck pocketknife, NOT a fixed-blade Buck hunting knife!"
5,love the stacking!,I purchase these as a second set of cookie racks and i have to say they are great! I love the fact that they stack up! I am limited on space in my kitchen so it is very nice feature.
4,middle boy's bible study,I looked for many books that would approach the many things that a young man should be learning to be a true man of God in the present world. I wanted something that would catch the children's interest and provoke thought and this book of How to be a man in 208 pages or less did exactly that. Thank you
4,Inspirational and compelling reading. A book on prayer.,"Written in old style English, this book is a straight forward account of the Revival, taking away any of the glamour romantically associated with Azusa Street. This is not a book for those with no prior knowledge of that great Revival, rather it fills in gaps, challenges on prayer and really centres on the moving of the Holy Spirit on several key people."
1,Item received not as advertised,Item received was not as advertised. Received book was 171 pages rather than 700+ as advertised. In addition the book received was printed in 1982 rather than 2000 as advertised.
1,Not very insightful or informative.,"As an introduction to hospitals, this is the most basic and uninsightful text. Not very informative. Not well written. If you really want to understand hospitals and their operation, this is not the book."
5,Shakespeare's Disease,"I bought this book after sighting it in a competitor store where I felt it was overpriced. My Amazon.com edition provided me with a book that reflected what I am currently going through as a retiree. With time on my hands, I decided that I wanted to see every production of Shakespeare. It did not matter where, college plays are fine! After I witnessed my third production, ""As You like it"" I was a victim of what I call""Shakespeare's Disease"". This book will explain what it is all about. Suddenly the desire to know everything about the plays and various productions over the years will open a new world to you (and a modest expense account). The Author fell into the same trap. It is a great account of the pursuit of everything Shakespeare. The only fault I found with it was a personal section of some length on the author re-discovering his Jewish faith, which I found out of place with the rest of the book. Otherwise it is a fine work and worthy of a summer read."
3,Gollob and Shakespeare,"On the whole, I found this book an enjoyable and interesting read. As another reviewer said, you will enjoy it more if you're sixty plus, fond of Shakespeare, and Jewish. I qualify on two out of three. The Jewish references were beyond my ken.For a person nearing retirement, it's fascinating to see what some people do with their lives after full-time paid employment ends. After I retire, I plan to read all the great works of literature I've missed so far, and Shakespeare is on my list.Gollob (he must hate it that so many people can't bother to spell his name correctly) took ""Shakespeare in Love"" far too seriously. After all, it was a romantic comedy. It was supposed to be fun! His criticism of its historical inaccuracies is like criticizing Shakespeare for his witches and fairies.Gollob is a little too full of himself at times, but he must have loved writing this book and gently bragging about his achievements and the famous people he's bumped against over the years."
5,Back to stupidity,"I'd switched on a free TV in the middle of the movie and was pleasefully amused with same gender affairs teen somehow-stupid comedy taking in a laughable world of adultscene quandaries, far away from the murdering, killing, shooting and simply rape of usually screened movies.This comedy is highly recommended for trying to have a rest from surrounding wherever on a globe where these topics are not taboo."
5,LOVE this novel!!,"Love this story had read it back in the late 80's, it was my Grandmother's and she passed it down to my mom however, I wanted one for myself. I had been looking everywhere for one (and it's sequel)for several years and I was over joyed to have found it on Amazon.com!!! I really don't like the cover picture as much as the original but as I understand when it went back into reprint the author had to come up with a new cover. BTW- I had the privilege of meeting Mrs. Statham last year!! It was a wonderful experience getting to meet her and hear her views on writing the story!"
1,Very miss leading,"In the item description it states (Includes 12 pcs protector films, wiper card, and cleaning cloth) Well there are not 12 protector films, there is only one set (meaning one for the top screen and one for the bottom screen) It was not worth the money or how long it took to ship this item."
1,Northing interesting here,I bought these for my ferret thinking it would be a treat for her. These things sat in the bottom of her cage for months and she never so much as sniffed them!
2,Ferrets Refused,"I have two ferrets at the moment, a near-3-year-old and a near 6-month-old. Both eat up different ferret chew-toy treats in mere moments, and they also seek out to try and gnaw on textures similar to these Marshall SuperChews, so I thought this item sounded perfect! I thought the texture would make the chews last longer than the others I've tried...well, I got my wish I suppose. Neither ferret will touch them, any of them. I tried everything it said on the packaging to encourage the ferrets to try them, nothing. I even tried my own tricks to get the ferrets to give them a try and even after getting them to briefly nibble they were still completely uninterested."
5,Incredibly detailed instruction makes novices look like pros,This book combines ease of use with high quality instruction which will make any new user a pro in no time flat.
3,Authorware 4 Authorized Review,"This book is ok for the beginner, but (as somebody else mentioned) next to useless for scripting. I wonder .... how can a book with such superficial sections on scripting get away with claiming to be a ""comprehensive"" reference? Similarly, how do the authors justify repeated suggestions that you look in other books for more info?!"
3,Difficulty with Using Authorware 4 Authorized CD-Rom,"The tutorial itself was pretty good, but I had great difficulty getting it to run. I contacted Macromedia Help (their number is at the back of the book). After talking with several Tech Help people - they said it was ""our computer"", though I work at a University with state of the art systems with 32 or 64 Megs of RAM. I finally talked with the product Director of Authorware, who directed me to someone who did, eventually, help me run it. All this amounted to about 45 min of long distance charges. I would make sure you have adequate memory, etc. and find out the return policy before purchasing this. Ron Farson"
3,Ok gun,This Gun says 7- 9 CFM but it seems to need alot more. all in all value for money but make sure your compressor is large enough.
5,if you love French indie films...,"I'm a huge Gaspard Ulliel fan. I really think he's a great actor and enjoy all of the films he's been in. This movie is all in French their are subtitles in English but if subtitles bother you I would skip this film. The plot is basically a story about growing, up falling in love, and learning about family secrets. The main story line is about the main charter and his love for a girl who doesn't love him back. Their are some clues to the plot that if you don't pay attention to you could miss a lot. I had to watch the movie twice to understand the ending, which is VERY sad. It's an indie film so if that's your thing this is a great film. But it now!"
3,The frustrations of growing up,"This movie is well crafted and the acting is very good. It's slow moving at times but the plight of the main character, his vulnerability and his obviously growing pain, pulled me into the movie so that I felt a strong need to see it through. It becomes increasingly clear that the main character, Simon, is a lonely young man. The movie begins by showing the viewer the end of the movie, without giving away the ending -- very cleverly done. I don't want to give anything away, but one might be tempted to ask ""does this thing still happen in 2005."" I think the answer is a resounding yes, which indicates that GLBT equality has a long way to go."
3,Gaspard Ulliel was Easy to look at,"This film was well done cinematically; acting, directing, script etc. however I felt it could have been a little tighter with the editing. I really thought Gaspard Ulliel did a fantastic job and he was EASY to look at! I also really enjoyed Nicole Garciale! I do think there should have been a little more sexual tension between the two young men and a bit more of an sexual awakening with Gaspard's character - his sexual identity seemed a bit un-clear."
3,The LAST day...,It was OK - not quite the story line I was thinking though.A little slow at times with the story...
4,"Turns letters, write books, does sit ups - I LOVE HER!!!","I bet that at any given moment, somebody, somewhere, is writing a Master's thesis called something like ""I'd Like To Solve the Puzzle: B-Celebrities and Why We Love Them"".From the very get-go in chapter 1, when Vanna tells you how she does her sit-ups then gives you instructions to make her favourite afghan, right to page 190, at the very end, when Vanna shamelessly plugs McDonald's, Spring Air mattresses, and Nestle's chocloate (and including more than 32 pages of photos inbetween!), I thought this book was brilliant and brainless. Apparently, just after this book was shortlisted for the Man Booker in early 1987, some scandalous, unauthorized photos of Vanna were published in Playboy."
3,Golden Glory,"Killah Priest returns with his third album, Priesthood. Although I enjoyed Priesthood, becuase it is five times better than last years View From Masada, it still could use some work. The production of the album is really cheap and boring, there are no standout beats that force you to feel the song, the producers only attempt to make heartfelt beats. I have been a Killah Priest fan since I heard him on the Gza's tape and I try to support everything he does, but this album is not too great. As usual, Killah Priest spits exceptional lyrics with a spiritual twist, and even though his lines are not as deep as his first album, Heavy Mental, he does showcase his ridiculous skill.The albums drawback, aside from WEAK production is the monotony of subject matter. The only true standout track is the joint featuring the Four Horsemen. The rest of the album seems to be an attempt to remake Heavy Mental. It's a decent album, but I know Killah Priest can do better."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","My two favorite Mariah ballads are ""Love Takes Time"" and ""Can't Let Go"", but this one isn't bad. Mariah is a superb vocalist, even better than Whitney, but this song is kind of weak. Joe and 98 Degrees don't add much. But it is a cute love song"
5,Mariah....A beautiful voice to a beautiful woman,"Some will say ""Mariah's lost it"" as in she cannot sing the way she used to..but it's not true in this case! Mariah combines her smooth relevant R&B techniques wtih a great artist like Joe and group 98 degrees in the title hit...Mariah flows along genuinly with the music and her voice shines brigtly at parts of the song..the backup singers give this song a great flow and Joe and Mariah make a great team..Mainly Mariah shows she still has the great skills of a pop vocalist and this song really reflects the hard work she has put into her music and her writing..such a beautiful song from such a beautiful songbird...Ms. Carey is simply amazing!Mariah's no.1 fan, Derek"
4,ANOTHER GREAT #1 FOR MARIAH!,"Obviously, this song was gonna go to #1. Mariah's second single off of her triple platinum album ""Rainbow"" is very well written, performed and produced. And with Joe and 98 degrees on it, it's even better! I just got the single and the second track on it is AMAZING! It has a dance feel to it and is re-mixed by mega producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They've produced such hits as ""That's The Way Love Goes"" and ""What Have You Done For Me Lately"" for Janet Jackson, and when they work with Mariah their material is even better! I really recommend people to get this single or the maxi-single (with four tracks). It's really good!"
4,The single is better,"I used to be a real big fan of Mariah, but latley she has really disappointed me with her new image.I was big on Mariah when first came out in 1990. My favorite song if hers to date is ""Fantasy"", especially the ODB Mix.Although, I do not like Boy Bands like 98 Degress, I was impressed when I sampled this CD single. I do like the 2nd track on this single (Celabatory Mix) because it has a dance club feel to it.If your a club person as I am you should enjoy the 2nd track especially. Personally, I don't care for the video or MTV for that matter. Nonetheless, I added this single to my other Mariah Single CD ""Fantasy"" from 1995.It may seem like I am slamming Mariah, but it's her new image that I dislike. Her new style is a major turn off considering her awesome lyrical talent. But sample it and see for yourself."
4,Sonic Sound,Amazing sound man ....its a full frequency response pedal ....this is one of the best distortion ever made....especially for rocking out...so touch responsive ..its a classic very amp like tone..
2,Picture is deceiving,"I just got the package and I was surprise to see the only one item. The shorter one. I ordered this item thinking I was getting two; The long and the short one. If I knew that this is only one item, I would have gone with the other product which is the half of the price."
2,boring,"I already knew all the recipes in this book, It's alright for people with no imagination. Pretty blah."
1,mislead,The product is fine except for the fact that it was stated it was a package of 10 when in fact I received a package of 2!!!! I got ripped off!!!
3,"Good music, but poor sound qulaity","Let me begin by saying that the music on this disc is great. If this review was just about the music, I'd give this recording five stars, no problem.But the sound quality with regard to both the trumpet and saxophone is poor. Which is hard to understand because the rhythm section sounds great here. It's as though Freddie and Stanley were recorded in mono and the others were recorded in stereo. It is so bad a distraction that I just became unable to listen to this recording, so I wound up selling it to a well-renowned jazz record store. Maybe someone else can get into this and get past the poor sound quality.I had been looking for this recording for years and was so excited when I realized it was out on CD. What a disappointment!"
1,Ick.,"I came across this book while doing research for my Ph.D. I have to say that it was poorly written. It took the authors forever to get to the point. I've ready many political books in the past few years and I have to say that this wasn't one of the better ones.I should have known better when I saw the quote from Newt Gingrich. (And I'm Republican, by the way.)"
1,Mediocre,"I read this book for class, and hated it. Poorly written, and the ideas were elementary. I wouldn't recommend this book if you're working on a paper on government. There are much better sources in the conservative realm."
3,"Not Really Extended, But Still STYX!","This CD is a re-release of several songs from 1997's STYX Return To Paradise. The disc is entitled EXTENDED VERSIONS, however after comparing the length of the songs to their counterparts on Return To Paradise I found them to be exactly the same. These cuts are not any different or longer than those on Return To Paradise. The track list is as follows: Blue Collar Man (4:34), Lady (3:29), Fooling Yourself (5:55), Renegade (6:02), Show Me The Way (5:11), Lorelei (4:04), Babe (4:50), Too Much Time On My Hands (5:43), Come Sail Away (8:34), The Best Of Times (7:42). If you are a STYX completist then you may want this disc. The cover has a picture of the band that I have not seen before (Todd, Chuck, JY, Tommy, Dennis).I was looking forward to some sweet jammed out takes on these tunes by STYX but these are just the same ones that came out in 1997. Oh well it's still STYX, just nothing new."
3,"A Discount Version of ""Return to Paradise""","If you already Own ""Return to Paradise"" don't Waste your time & money on this one. As the previous reviewer points out the tracks are the exact same length as those tracks found on the complete 2 CD ""Return to Paradise"" because they are indeed the exact same tracks. Another example of record company chislers trying to squeeze the last dime out of an artist by repackaging an existing release and confusing their fans with titles such as ""Encore Collection: Extended Versions"" when they should have called it ""Return to Return to Paradise"" so us Styx fans know what we are getting into. A good choice for the casual fan if you don't want to pony up for the 2 CD version. Check out the new ""Arch Allies"" 2 CD release for some fresh live Styx & Reo from the 2000 tour. I was in the 4th row at that show when they filmed and recorded it at Riverport and it kicked."
4,A low priced version of the live CD from 2000.,"I only bought this CD as a collectors item, it is exactly the same as the REO disk in the STYX/REO Arch Allies CD, but with the addition of a video of 157 Riverside Ave. for PC.Overall a great low cost live CD for any rock fan and a collector's item for any REO fan."
3,great live cd styx,"my favorite track & song is lady dennis did a really great job singing it. the drummer is fantastic on this cd. along with the guitar work. this cd is a cd you can enjoy listing to the whole thing, styx is not styx with out dennis at the helm of the ship. i seen styx live in lincoln nebraska in 2002. a great show but not the same without dennis singing."
4,One of the best releases of 2002!,"Jeff Kashiwa has done what many thought would be impossible. To improve upon ""Another Door Opens"" is a real accomplishment. Jeff's tone is as sweet as can be. Dave Kochanski and Chuck Loeb brought out the fabulous abilities of Kashiwa and smoothed the whole release out wonderfully. Highly, highly recommended!"
5,Love these candles!,"These are very fragrant and burn perfectly. I've tried a few other brands, but come back to ZUM GLOW. Wish they had more fragrances. you will not be sorry with this item."
1,Deceiving,"My son loved his first trip to the circus, so I thought this DVD would be fun for him. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with this purchase. The cover has a tiger jumping through a ring of fire - there is NOT a tiger or fire anywhere on the DVD. The show is very second-rate, seeming almost home-made."
4,What's with the giant spoon?,The shorts the guys chose for this DVD were obvious condidates for the MST3K-like treatment. Some of these are such strange films that without the commentary they would be almost unwatchable! My favorite out of this whole bunch was the one on coffee houses. Who knew folk singing could be so annoying?
5,Burn is riveting!,"Despite having several professional books and papers on my agenda to read at one time, I happened to pick up Eric Cuestas-Thompson's riveting novel and I couldn't put it down. What a read! The characters burn with passion and I got caught in the crossfire. I appreciated the novel being set in Tucson because I could visualize where many events took place. It is easy to picture ""Burn"" as a movie, and maybe Tucson will make a return as a picture-making town. In short: ""Burn"" left me breathless! If you want raw passion laced with intelligence and fiery conflict, this novel is for you. I hope the author will write lots more!"
1,Disguisting! Horrible! AWFUL surprise!,"I actually thought this was a different book- I was trying to order ""Burn: melting into the image of Jesus."" Okay, so it was my fault I didn't look into this book more. I thought I was getting just a cheaper copy of the book I wanted, but imagine my horrible surprise when I opened up the book and began reading some horror-porno story. The first chapter is about a doctor ""f-ing"" his clients- raping them. I flipped through it and each chapter is about other disturbed individuals who have outrageous lust issues. I only read a few lines here and there and I felt like vomiting. This book was so horrible I didn't even want to throw it away for fear someone else might make the terrible mistake of picking it up and reading it, so I burned it. An ending for this book suiting to the title: burn."
2,Too many errors spoil the read,"This book is unfortunately not very good. While the story may have potential, the writing is weak and needs a good proofreader.The interweaving of characters is intriguing, but the typos,mis-spellings,and various other mistakes detract from the novel.One character, a police officer, was at times called Andrews and other times McAndrews! Way too confusing! Get an editor!I hope if the author writes another book, and I do think he has potential-PLEASE first read and re-read the work before going to print! Readers will thank you!"
3,Cool in Seattle,"I liked the book. I had a friend from Tucson recomend it and I am glad he did. I couldn't put it down! Sure there were typo's as your first reviewer stated and some grammatical errors but even the best have some of that in their novels. Super first novel Eric Cuestas-Thompson, I hope there will be another."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever,"What a mess! There was way too much that was not explained, for starters. The kid (Jesse) needs some acting lessons. Some special effects were OK, others were terrible - the outer space scenes were a joke, and when the bank blew up I swear that the guys on the balcony were in mid-air *before* the explosion *started*. Sheesh. The virtual game machines were ludicrous as well, and it was some coincidence that Jesse could just hop in and operate a seemingly complex control panel like an expert. Overall it was very difficult to follow, especially how the main characters memory appeard to be selective depending on what time they were in. The story had potential but the poor execution made it one of the worst movies I've ever seen, if the THE worst."
1,Horrible movie,"After reading the plot synopsis on IMDB/Amazon and listening to the narration in the beginning of the movie, I can safely say that I have no idea what was going on in the movie. The story could have been interesting if done properly, but the script was horrible and the time-line jumped around more than a bunny rabbit.Only watch this movie if you enjoy torturing your brain or feeling like a movie that will leave you confused for 100 minutes."
5,Cocker Powerhouse,I agree completely with the last reviewer who forgot to hit the 5 star selection. A monument to an incredible series of concerts that pushed Joe and his entourage to the limits every night. It captures a time and spirit perfectly and the music sounds as dynamic today as ever.
5,Great Album,I was not to sure whether I would like the album as much as my memories were of it. I had a vinyl record of the album back in the day. It copped a thrashing then. I don't have it any more. I was pleasantly surprised as to how much I like the CD. The sound quality is really good. It passes muster with a good set of headphones. I have listened to it probably way too much already. It is a great buy and Joe and his band of merry men put on a performance that just doesn't happen any more.
5,So Good So Good So Good,"Can't say it enough. If I was stranded on a desert island with just one record, I'd probably take Mad Dogs and Englishmen. Sure, lots of albums are just as good as this one, but everytime I listen to it, I feel like I'm in a roomful of 100 or so dear, dear friends."
5,Just like old times,"I originally had this as...dare I say...an 8-track tape! I haven't had an 8-track player in years and I was missing this music, so I broke down and bought the cd. Still great after all these years. Thank you!"
4,Mad Dogs & Englishmen,"Mad Dogs & Englishmen is a live album with Joe Cocker that was recorded in 1970 and features a blend of rock and soul. Cocker is here in his prime and we hear him sing with alot of covers. Here we have Cocker singing rocksongs written by Beatles, Roling Stones, Traffic and Bob Dylan. He also sings bluescovers by Ray Charles, Sam and Dave and Otis Redding. The book-let is quite remarkable. J.P. Bean has written a very poignant, informative and well-written essay about the tour. To think that Cocker was more or less forced to play on this tour to be able to work in America again is so strange and bewildering. The inside also includes many strange photos and I do not quite understand what they are supposed to represent. 4/5."
4,Terrific but flawed,"Well, there are indeed a lot of high points on this, but there are some low points too. Joe and Leon's rendition of ""Girl from the North Country"" sounds like they're reading the lyrics off the back of an envelope and having a hard time seeing them. And Rita Coolidge is so out of tune on ""Superstar"" that she makes my ears bleed. If you like her singing on that track, you will love the collected recordings of Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. Skip those two tracks and enjoy the rest."
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"I BOUGHT ONE ON DECEMBER 2011, I USED FOR 6 MONTHS, AND DIE.IT WONT WORK AT ALL, I SUPPOSE IT WILL LAST FOR AT LEAST 1 YEAR.I DO NOT RECOMENT AT ALL THESE PRODUCT."
1,Stay away,Correct part number for my camera.Correct voltage for my camera.Correct connectors for my camera.Batteries are too large to fit in my camera!I threw them in the trash.I didn't expect much for the price. I just wanted a couple spares for when the camera goes dead and I have nowhere to charge it.Oh well. Teach me to buy junk.
4,peyote,have not used the book yet. ordered it for later in the semester. good condition. arrived in a timely manner. much cheaper than even renting at the bookstore. would buy from this seller again.
1,Way too strong,"Tried opening the capsule and taking only 60mg but tastes horrible. Should've read the recommended dosage before ordering but was in a ""desperate to lose weight moment""."
2,Solaray-Forskohili,I bought this because I suffer from hyperthyroid condition although I take a prescribed medication I thought this might help to boost my metabolism I have not seen any change I eat 1200 calories per day and workout every day. I would not buy this again.
4,Seems to work,"I bought this after watching Dr. Oz talk about it. He said that it helps to break up fat cells. Since using it, it seems to help with weight loss."
3,Foskohlii,I bought this because I saw it on Dr. Oz as something that could help your metabolism. I honestly don't know if it's made any difference or not.
1,Not enough forskolin,Ordered this not reading that it only has a guarantee of 3.85 mg of forskolin. That means you would have to take almost 13 pills a day to get the scientific recommended amount you need to take each day which is 50 mg of active forskolin. Sorry but not impressed. Buy another product that actually has more than 10 mg per serving which is a much greater value.
2,Forskohlii,"I tried product but had no effect on me. I do understand that everyone's reaction could be different but to me no effect. After reviewing quite a bit, I found out that for this product to be effective, dosage has to be much more higher than 385mg. But again, I suggest that everyone do their own little research and see if product would work for him/her."
4,So Far So good!,"I've been working out and eating healthy, Prior to purchasing this I had lost about 15lbs but felt like I wasn't getting anywhere, easily had another 20-25 lbs to go.I definately saw an increase in weightloss when I started taking Forskohlii."
3,Not all songs are originals,"I bought this CD for basically 1 song that I haven't been able to find anywhere else (at least not the original version)--""Fool (If You Think Its Over)"" by Chris Rea...there was no audio clip for these songs, so after reading the previous review, I assumed all songs were the original version but this song is not...or at least not the version thats been played on the radio forever (never heard this version before). Needless to say, I wasted my money. It would be very helpful if all cd's on amazon had an audio sample so this type of thing doesn't happen, but I did buy it used so Im sure its not always possible to do. As far as the rest of the songs, they seem to be original versions and its an ok compiliation."
1,Not even worth $5 !!!,Burned out the very first day! Lasted less time than it took me to prep the place I stuck it. Should have just unwrapped it and stuck it in the trash. Pure garbage.
3,This album is better than nothing but incomplete,"The problem with this album is that there are so many great songs from his Ghost Writer and One-Eyed Jack albums missing. Cuts like ""Rough and Ready"" and ""35 millimeter dreams"" from Ghost Writer are vastly superior to some included here. Those songs and others from One-Eyed Jack have more rockin drive than what are mostly ballads in this collection. Nevertheless, this collection is better than nothing.I'm glad I've got the vinyl copies of the above mentioned albums as this album is far from a complete retrospective of a great artist. I don't know who compiled this album, but a more complete anthology or re-issues of the Ghost Writer and One-Eyed Jack albums would really be nice."
5,great introduction,"Hard to argue with the choice of songs on this single disc compilation. Of course it's incomplete; Garland Jeffreys had so many excellent songs recorded by the time they released this disc that there were bound to be many songs excluded that are favorites of his fans. But if you are new to Garland's music and want to know why he is so beloved by so many music fans, this CD would be a very good start. The famous tunes such as ""Wild in the Streets"" and ""Matador"" are here, plus many more fine examples of his eclectic musical style. This is an artist to cherish and support. He's that special. Spread the word!"
5,"""...one of Latin-American leading writers..""","Length:: 0:32 Mins""Peruvian novelist and essayist, Mario Vargas Llosa, is one of Latin-American leading writers. In The Feast of the Goat, he recreates the final days of Dominican Republic dictator General Rafael Trujillo's evil regime."" This as quoted in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" published by America Reads Spanish, a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US."
5,Llamado de conciencia,"La fiesta del chivo constituye, a mi modo de ver, el retrato y la decision de un autor como Mario Vargas Llosa de decir la verdad de lo que sucedio en la Era de Trujillo, la verdad que muchos se han negado a escribir o hablar, por temos a que se descubra lo que fueron durante la Era. Muchas familias dominicanas de gran vigencia hoy dia estuvieron ligadas al regimen y les da temor que se les involucra en los actos que Vargas Llosa denuncia eran el pan de cada dia de un sistema que vio perder miles de vidas, a causa de la satrapia con que nos goberno un hombre que concentro todo el poder politico y economico en sus manos. Ah, me podrian decir quien en realidad es el senador Henry Chirinos en la obra, es decir, quien en la vida real, si es Polibio Diaz u otro."
5,Lo Mejor de Vargas Llosa,"He leido muchas novelas historicas y nunca he dado mi humilde opinion publicamente. Sin embargo despues de leer La Fiesta del Chivo, me veo en la necesidad de hacerlo. En esta novela, Vargas Llosa nos envuelve en un realismo fantastico que por desgracia fue vivido por miles de pobres Dominicanos y de otras nacionalidades como es el caso del Prof. Galindez ( Espana ) Luis Munoz Marin ( Puerto Rico ), Romulo Betancourt( Venezuela ) y todo los que hemos leido esta obra maestra de Vargas Llosa. Digo esto ultimo, porque luego de leer esta obra, no podemos cerrar los ojos y olvidarnos. Esta novela debe de cambiar nuetra forma de pensar, de ver las cosas. Gracias Vargas Llosa."
5,Present for Dad,This book was a purchase for dad it has to do with where he grew up and he loved it.
2,looks nice,It looked nice when I opened the package. I got one with a dead battery and it has been in a drawer since. When I bought it the price was almost double it is now. I was very disappointed.
3,"nice watch, but . . .","for starters, plan on throwing out the watch band and buying a better one at Target or Walmart; it's too skiiny for the watch and basically useless. It looks great with the new velcro type band I found at Walmart. Unlike the Ironman watch I wore previously, the digital controls are just not intuitive. I am still trying to figure the settings and the included instructions aren't much help. I do think the watch looks great for the price, though."
2,it is just ok...,"for the price i can say that the watch is just ok...on average it looks nice (good design)...but surely it didnt meet my expectations...why?- the glass was partially scratched already on arrival...- the indiglo backlight doesnt cover all of the watch area, with a small area being left out which indeed disturbs..- the strap could have been of better quality - looks and feels cheap..."
4,Jannisaries Pournelle,"I rate Pournelle either good or great. This one is only good but it is a necessary part of the series, and the series as a whole leaves you wanting to now more about Galloway and Company. Reason that this is good but not great is that there are a few too many cardboard characters.The series seems to be a lead in to another series about a galactic empire and that is going to be a tough job."
3,Not for a beginner,"This book is pretty helpful if you already know Cold Fusion. It is exactly what the title says, Cold Fusion 5. What makes this book standout is the sample application that is built within the book (Skate.Shop). This application is an e-commerce app that will actually work when you are complete. I especially liked the database chapter. It will really help someone who isn't very familiar with database creation. Overall, I would recommend this book to more advanced users. Though those users may not need to be led by hand to develop an e-commerce site."
4,Well rounded tome and covers a lot of ground,"Well rounded tome and covers a lot of ground. Where is the CD? For $59.99 should have a Disc. Includes a nice overview of the Software Development Life Cycle. Section on Advanced Error Handling is helpful. Complete coverage of subtleties and easily misunderstood aspects of Cold Fusion, e.g. if session time out is set by application code versus what is set CFA. Nice discussion of how to extend CF via other languages, tags, COM, COBRA....Assumes developer is also the DBA and server administrator is written with the latter two roles in mind to include many screenshots for configuring the server for both roles. Author's prose is light and humorous e.g. when describing the caller scope an analogy is made to vomit leaving happy people on amusement park rides (well it was funny in the book). In all a solid book that has a lot to offer"
3,Ballet Shoes,"The slippers are a light pink and they already have one end of the elastic band that covers your feet sewn in. You have to sew the other end. Also, I'm a size 9 regular shoe and the size 9 slippers are a wee bit tight, but they work. I still recommend ordering a half size up. Also, they don't cover my heel very well. They go about half-way up and it feels weird to me compared to my other pair of leather ballet slippers that I have. But overall, they work. I'd give them a B-."
3,Radio to technology TV,"I got this book for a Media Arts college class. It starts at the beginning of radio all the way up to turn of the century TV technology. If you are looking for a book that gives a descriptive history of mostly TV and radio, this is quite a good book.One of the best things about this book is the chronological organization. Each decade is a separate chapter, each year is a seperate section. It also includes a timeline along the top of each page covering the details of history at that time for a greater understanding of socially induced technological changes."
5,Best Product,"I had infection in my mouth and doctor told me I would need a surgery. My friend recommended this Maitake therapy, and I can see that my infection is gone. I went to my doctor this week and was told I would not need a surgery any more. Thanks to Enzymatic, it's a great product!"
3,Too early to tell,"I got this to give my dog, who has a large fatty tumor on her leg. It's only been a few weeks, so hard to tell if it's helping. I plan to give it in larger doses and see if that helps."
2,Medicore Sophmore Slump,"After his amazing My Thoughts debut, Avant returned with his medicore Ectasy CD. Avant comes off like a weak R.Kelly clone in many of the songs, and in all honesty Avant is a much stronger singer than Kells. The only songs where Avant showed the promise that we saw in his first album are the songs Thinkin About You, Don't Say No Just Say Yes and Makin Good Love."
1,Ecstasy can Kill You,The only reason I have this Avant album was because my sister bought it ( without my explicit authorization and consent....from now on all her music purchases go through me so maybe she will stop buying horrible albums) and I burnt it. Thank goodness I didn't waste my money on this...this...on this. It was so much garbage...the only good song ( in my opinion) was the one he dropped for the single and I don't even know the name of it. He can sing but that's about all. That doesn't guarantee a good album. I've listened to the cd probably twice when it came out and has been collecting major dust in my extensive myriad of albums. If I was you I would pass the album going 200 miles per hour without even bothering to look in the rearview mirror.
3,"""ECSTASY""? Not really.","Avant's sophmoric effort didn't grab me the way I thought it would. In fact, it left feeling slightly confused. I remember when he found his groove with his first recording MY THOUGHTS. Now THAT was a CD to brag about. This one sounds like he is trying to be someone he wasn't meant to be. His voice and the numerous hip-hop hooks didn't mix well for me. It was almost like listening to a second-rate R. Kelly. The only saving grace was his ballads. Now they were right on time, at least, the majority were. If I have to hear MAKIN' GOOD LOVE one more time, there will be major hair pulling, starting with my ears! I would only advise the most dedicated fan to invest, otherwise, be very wary."
4,Perfect Storage!,"I bought this organizer a couple of years ago and it is still used daily. I keep my lipgloss, insurance card, pictures, business cards and pens in it. Don't know what I'd do without it."
2,Nice organizer,The reaso I gave it only TWO stars is the straps to slide over the visor are too short. Had to re-engineer using velcro.
2,cheap,"it works... but the construction is super cheap. the flap where the glasses go for example, barely closes and only has a little velcro thing int he middle. the edges flop down. :/"
4,Product good; initial merchant stinks,"Finally got this (quickly) from a second merchant after waiting a month and multiple phone calls (and no refund yet) from Bargain Cell (listed as ""in stock"").So far, I like it. Can't say yet about the quality of sound, as my first and only use was in the wind on a bicycle, but I like its many features:a built-in 3.5-2.5 system so you could use your other mp3 headphones. There's also a volume control, which I really like, as the sound was too loud from mp3 files on old mono headset.Price seems quite reasonable."
4,Quality Product,This set of headphones is very good. The volume is good and the adapter is actually the best thing about it because it ensures that ANY normal headphone jack can be adapted to a 2.5mm phone standard. The only issues I have with it is the adjustable volume on the side of the call button because it has a tendency to slide on its own in the pocket.
5,perfect!,this thing is so perfect for my phone sure there are lots of mor expensive ones but this is all you need! sounds great and very clear!
4,Perfect for ANY phone with 2.5mm jack,"This has been the perfect item for listening to music with my phone.Pros: Allows for use of any headphone set. The microphone part works great! You can clip it to the top of your shirt and talk like normal. The people I have talked to using it couldn't tell that I was using it. Volume control is very nice feature as well.Cons: The earphones that come with the item are HORRIBLE! I compared their music quality to iPod headphones, and the sound quality of the included headphones is very poor indeed. Also, if you use your own headphones, there is a lot of wires hanging everywhere. I have tied up lots of the cord with a twistie tie to cut back on dangling cords."
4,Good value for the money,"I mainly use this product to listen to music, and only for conversation if someone happens to call while I'm listening. You can't deny that it serves it's purpose and performs well for the money. The extended length on the right ear bud cord is a minor irritant. It probably looks stranger than it actually feels. Anyone who wants to be critical of the bass response, warmth of ths sound, etc., should invest in a more expensive unit. One drawback of note is that in conversation, if you and the person on the other end talk at the same time, the sound of the other person's voice ""blanks out"" momentarily. Once again, keeping things in perspective, that is not something that would have stopped me from purchasing it had I known in advance. Overall, I would say this product's performance exceeds it's value, considering the low cost."
4,Ok Item,"Overall it is a gooditem. The sound quality of the earphone's aren't that good, but you can attach any earphones that you want because of the adapter that it has. I love it. No more ipod for me! Now it's just my phone!"
1,I cant use in my LG Incite CT810,I cant use this headset in my LG Incite CT810 cell to lisent the FM radio of my phone
1,false advertisement,If your cell phn is en vx9900 this IS not for you - as advertise they claim it is compatible but it's not ---BUYERS BEWARE
2,LG Cell Phone Headset,"The cord is too long for a cell phone and the volume is too low, difficult to hear people on the other end."
5,Finally a headset that works for phone and music,"I recently got a LG EnV2 and loaded some music into the player. Big disappointment -- the sound is reminescent of a 1960's transister radio. I bought two different kinds of stereo headsets and neither worked well for listening to music. I then bought this headset, and can honestly say that it is ""close"" to what you'd hear from a Ipod. I especially like the feature that I can remove the ear buds and use my over the ear phones for jogging. The price is great. My only issue now is that even at it's lowest volume setting it's too loud for quiet enviroments, but I think that is a phone issue, not a headset issue."
2,Needs adapter,"I ordered this for my son to be sent to him as birthday gift and I got the call that Dad had ordered the wrong thing. It does not fit the LG Chocolate without an adapter. I was very disappointed. My son did say that when he went to the Mall and got the adapter it sounded pretty good, its just that the its hard to keep the adapter plugged in. I wish the advertisement was accurate."
3,A hands free headset,"One day when it was raining out I was trying to dial my cell phone but the rain stopped my attempt. So I had to wait till I found shelter from the rain to place the call, from that moment I decided to purchase a headset. I searched for a few days to find a headset that I could afford and would work on my phone. I purchased this headset but failed to read that it was a 2.5mm end and not a 3.5mm male end which is what my cellphone required. But I recently purchased a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter to fix my problem. The product worked just fine."
2,I own it; don't buy it.,"I thought this thing would be great. I also ignored a few other reviews. I thought it was great for the first two minutes.Your phone sounds great in stereo, or at least with both ears hearing the same stuff. BUT... the chord to one ear is so short that the thing is always hanging off to the side AND I have a hard time getting it to get a constant connection with my phone. My handfree headset ended up in the trash without reservation."
1,Very poorly made,"I brought this bcos it is cheap and it is, LG. Price = quality. It is a very poorly made, cheap product. Lots of interference, the other person cannot hear me, spend few more dollars and get something better if you are a frequent user."
1,Perplexing and unusable,"Not sure what LG was thinking with this one. The earphones conect to the microphone module using 3.5 mm plug and the microphone module connects using a 2.5 mm plug and the phone uses the LG proprietary USB connector. I firt bought a 3.5 mm USB adapter which let me connect the earbuds to the phone and seemed to work, but to use it as a hands free phone I had to also by a 2.5 mm plug adapter. My last LG phone had a 2.5 mm headphone adapter built in and that was what I was expecting when I bought the phone. I actually have more $ invested in adapters now than headphones and it still does not work well. Boo to LG all the way around."
