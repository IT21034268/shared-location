1,An Insult to Doctor Seuss,"This is not the classic book by Doctor Seuss. Instead, it is an adaptation of the movie -- using some of the same characters in a compleltely different story. The Cat in the Hat is a great piece of literature, and it's unfortunate that many people will accidentally buy this pale imitation instead. They'll end up with a moronic sitcom instead of Dr. Seuss's masterpiece. The movie and all of the associated products are an insult to the legacy of Dr. Seuss. They preserve none of the spirit of Seuss's work, none of the magic and mystery of the world he created. They lack the flair for colorful language and poetic imagery that made Seuss great. The fact that this book even exists is enough to make me weep."
1,everyone involved with this book should be ashamed,"Deeply, bitterly ashamed. Poke out their eyes with sticks and wander the world in rags kind of shame.By everyone involved, I don't just mean the so-called-writers, editors and executives who foisted this upon us. I also include the people who picked out the glue for the binding. The people who put this book into boxes, and who drove it to the stores, and who put it out for display are all culpable.Not only is this is the worst book that's ever been published, it is the worst book that could ever BE published. Yes, this is the worst book in Borges' library.Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd have reason to accuse ""Little Golden Book"" of rape, but here it is."
4,"Great Catchy songs, not the best album!!!","There are some songs that make the album a little dull. For example, the song Secretly repeats itself like over 10 times. The other ones seem to be on the safe side."
5,Best Book on the Cold War,"This book is brilliant in every respect: the writing is crystal clear, even elegant and the analysis is sharp. The conclusions are wise and have stood the test of time. Unreservedly recommended for anyone seeking to understand the roots of the cold war and the role of alliance politics in bringing it to an end."
3,Solid teaching from personal experience.,Courageous Leadership has solid leadership principals that are taught with an abundance of personal stories and experience. This allows for new perspectives on tried concepts.
2,Things you dare not do in a church,"This is my first reading of a Bill Hybels. Maybe I was setting myself up for a great time. Instead, I was left with a guilt and shame feeling. Making people feel guilty that they are letting the pastor and the Kingdom of God down by not showing up for a meeting....that takes something."
5,Courageous Leadership,This is an excellent book for anyone who is a leader in a church. The author has written the book in an easy to understand format. He gives excellent practical advice for leaders.
4,Pop leadership thinking at its best,"Of course Hybels is an outstanding leader. He can also write. This book incorporates not only his personal insights but ideas he has gleaned from mainstream leadership thinking, contextualized for ministers. My students enjoyed this as a text for an intro to leadership class."
4,"Yes, it will hold your dumbbells for you.",The stand does what it was made for. I like it because I can move the dumbbells easily to my designated workout area and then back to the corner of the room when I am finished. It's really more of a convenience and not a necessity to have.The only thing I didn't like is that the stand I got is somewhat uneven on the bottom. That is probably why they give you adjustable wheels and pegs because the company must have been aware that the quality varies and they cannot make the pieces perfectly even.
3,Weighted-Rack--- Sounds like one of my old gir friends!,"Not an easy assembly- time consuming and frustrating. However, I love the weights and the stand as a package. Not low tech- don't drop or you'll be sorry! Eat your spinach- Popeye! Here comes Brutus! Love, Olive-Oil"
4,Nice product,Product arrived quickly. I purchased both this and the Bowflex SelectTech Dumbell Stand and I am impressed by how heavy/sturdy they are. Assembly for both was a breeze. Bowflex clearly has their act together.If it were me I would've included some form of 'locking mechanism between the base of the dumbell holder and this stand.
5,Great!,It was a workout building the stand but I love it. The stand pretty much saved my back during p90x super sets. I should have bought it earlier. Bring it!
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"A must have for your Bowflex dumbbells. It gets them off the ground and makes them easy to move around. It was super easy to put together. A bit pricey IMO, but there are not many other options."
5,"Sturdy, easy to assemble","After reading other reviews, I was concerned this would be difficult to assemble. Maybe they've improved the instructions, but I found it very easy to put together by reading the instructions. I think there are two keys to make it go smoothly.1. Don't fully tighten the screws at first. They should be just loose enough to have some room to move to get everything in place. Once it's assembled, then tighten everything down.2. Use a socket wrench with a ratchet. Use the hex wrench to hold one side in place and use the socket wrench to tighten. The proper socket size is listed in the instructions, but I think it was 9/16"".It only took my about 30 min. to get it fully assembled from the time I opened the box. It has been a huge improvement when doing P90X to put the dumbbells in easy reach to adjust and pickup to minimize down time between sets and avoid risk of injury from picking them up from the floor each time."
5,My son loves these,"I bought these for my (grown) son for his birthday and he loves them.I mentioned that a few reviews said the size of the dumbbells made some exercises awkward at the limits of the movement, but he said he hasn't noticed any problem. Very happy with the quality, convenience, and compact storage."
4,Good Stand poor instructions,I have owned the 1090 dumbells for 4 years and I finally picked up the stand . It makes a huge difference grabbing them from the stand rather than the floor. I am only giving the stand 4 stars because this was a pain in the ass to put together. The instructions are poorly written I would advise not tighten all the bolts until the end and make sure you use a socket wrench the Allen wrench that comes with the stand will make the job a lot tougher.
3,Bowflex SelectTech 552 / 1090 Dumbbell Stand,"The SelectTech Dumbell Stand, while in my opinion, both a necessary and desireable companion to the Bowflex 552 SelectTECH weights, required both a too lengthy and too detailed assembly. Way too many small parts."
1,Not for the long haul,"I purchased a set of these high tech dumbbells several years ago and the plastic material covering the weight plates has become brittle and is now cracking and falling off. I wish I had spent the money on a set of plain jane, low tech and indestructable dumbbells."
1,"Horrible, WHY? Read it! ! !","When I got the item I though it could be easy to set it up, but I was wrong. The instructions are so bad that it includes only one paper with no pictures, tools are not numbered or named. I got the picture from the internet, but it was still difficult to figure out which screw was going in which hole. The screws were too big and too small... I had hard time setting it up, It took me almost three <3> hours to set it up.But the bumbells are great.And one star is because i cant put lower then that..."
3,Bad instructions,"I just bought one of these to go along with my dumbells and I have to say the instructions are some of the worst I've ever seen. Nice idea, but trouble out of the box!"
2,Quality not what I expected,"The product is functional and does what it says however the right side parts and left side parts came mismarked L and R or is it R and L. One stand is about 2 inches lower than the other so I took the whole thing apart and swapped pieces from one side to the next and then the other side was short. After laying the large silver frames side by side its obviouse its not the assembly and that the parts are assymetrical. This also prevents the towel rack between the two platforms from being attached. Since it pretty much does what it is supposed to, does not cause me any issue with lifting the dumbbells off and IF it was not such a pain to disassemble and rebox I would have sent it back to get a new one.Dumbbell adjustment mechanism sticks a little but I suspect this will losen up over time or with a little squirt of oil."
4,Nice to have with Selecttech 552,"this only took me 45 min to setup and was straightforward. the only reason I gve 4 stars is it is pricey for what it is, but is good relief for back and quick P90x weight changes."
3,bow flex weights,I received my bow flex product very fast. The only thing I am finding fault with is one set seems to be very gritty and dirty and not the other. I don't know if the other was defective or used. Not that happy with the product for the price I paid.
5,A necessity!,We love the Bowflex dumbbells and the stand is a real necessity to avoid a lot of bending and stooping. Great product. Bought ours through the Amazon marketplace for about half price. No regrets.
5,"If you own the selectech, then this is a must.",If you own the selectech bowflex dumbells then this dumbell stand is a must. It allows you to pick up the weights with out haveing to bend over and strain your back. For that reason alone is is worth the money. Also the rack is well built and not bad to look at either. It makes a great combination with the selectech 552 dumbells that I purchased.
4,saves your back,"Unless you have a table or counter to put these weights on, it's just not good for your back. When re-racking weights and having to put it back on the floor.This rack was built for the dumbbells and functions as it is. The wheels are very helpful when needing to wheel these things around. Especially for cleaning. Very stable."
4,Very sturdy and does not take up a lot of space,"I did not find this all that hard to put together. It does come in pieces and the instructions could be written better, but it only took about a half hour to 45min to put it together. It is a very solid and steady base and there is no fear of the weights falling off of it. It fits well in a corner so it can stay out of the way. The only drawback is the straps they have are pretty useless. They cannot actually go around the dumbbells and the holders that you set the dumbbells into. I have never moved it out of the corner I set it in, so it is not a big deal, but if I ever had to move it, there is no way to strap the dumbbells into place."
3,Bowflex SelectTech 552 / 1090 Dumbbell Stand,"I didn't buy this from amazon. I had purchased it from bowflex's web site on a fathers day special for $50.00. Just a warning, these are as heavy as one of the sets of barbells i've bought. As I see many people posted ""workout, before workout."" It's nice, but not necessary and it's heavy. Just my two cents."
5,Great Stand,"I didn't even need the instructions on how to put this together. it was so simple and only took me 20 minutes. i was amazed after i put this together how many people had problems putting this together... Anyways, this is an awesome product and now i can finally get my 1090's off the damn floor."
5,well built and easily assembled,"Just a quick note of the SelectTech 552 Dumbbell stand as I was very pleasedwith the quality and the fabrication of this equipment, even thoughit is made in China. Also one of the reviewers made itsound as though it was like assemblinga space craft. It is very easy and well instructed for assemblyall you need is an Allen wrench which comes with it and anadjustable wrench or to make it really easy a 9/16th wrench.Also Amazon has the best price and I have never beendisappointed with their service. This stand will save thelower back and well worth the money, if you are serious about exercisingwith the Dumbbells."
1,Dangerous shoes!,"These shoes are adorable, but incredibly slippery. My toddler chipped a tooth after slipping in these shoes, and the company was not concerned at all. They suggested I spend even more money on no-slip material to add to the soles. Shouldn't a toddler shoe come ready-to-wear without required modifications?"
4,"Great ballet film, but needs restoration and DVD","This is one of the best ballet films of all time, and it would rate a five-star review if restored and made available on DVD. In my opinion, this rarely seen Taglioni/Schneitzhoeffer version of ""La Sylphide"" (a historic reconstruction adapted for the technical abilities of late-20th-century dancers) is better than the more frequently performed Bournonville/Lovenskjold interpretation (inexplicably, although this tape is of the former version, Amazon has it listed with the name ""Lovenskiold""). Unfortunately, the film is only available on VHS and is in bad need of restoration. A full restoration and DVD of this ""La Sylphide"", similar to what has been done with Nureyev's ""Don Quixote"", would be spectacular. Still, if you haven't seen it, it's worth getting the tape."
4,Works well,"Good for dressing changes. Gave these to the nurses on my ortho floor for daily dressing changes, they really like them. The larger size helps with bulky dressings because of leverage. Speeds things up. Not top quality surgical stuff but quality is good and is well above the price. Not ""disposable"" after a few uses like most in this range. Would highly recommend."
3,adequate,Okay. Not super sharp but great scissor for the price. I use it in my office and it works well on bandages etc.
3,Personal Philosophy of the Author,"From the inside of the cover of the book, written by the book's author: This is a story of cosmic space and ideas. It is about a human space traveler . . . who lands upon a distant planet on the other side of the Universe. . . . [He] discovers he has come upon a planet called Vinibus and that its inhabitants . . . are beings physically very much like himself. . . . He is caught up in a whirl of events which quickly take him to the far corners of the planet. He finds adventure, excitement, love, and an altogether fascinating state of affairs . . . which definitely has its unearthly aspects."
1,"Not for the parents who is suddenly ""Coach"".","I recently was named to coach my son's 5&6 year old soccer team. So the sub-title of this book really appealled to me, ""For the Mom or Dad who is suddenly 'Coach'"". THIS BOOK IS ONLY 23 PAGES! Unfortunately, while this book does have some pointers on how to teach Winning Soccer at a more advanced level, say high school age; it did not meet my needs. It almost totally focused on what positions put your players on the field and almost nothing else. Additionally, he uses many archaic terms to describe the positions. Additionally, as I stated above this book is only twenty-three pages in length, half of which are field diagrams. If I had seen this book at a brick-and-mortar, I would have read the entire thing in two minutes and never purchased it. It also has almost no explanations of the rules (as if there is room in 23 pages). I am very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Short book -- Old methods,"I recently started coaching my son's 5&6 year old team. I was looking for some development areas, practices, and key insights. While this book does have some good pointers, it simply was written for a coach who knows the rules of the game and has a team of kids over the age of say, 13. This book teaches a few quick strategies and positioning. I need a book to help my kids not all run to the ball or take the ball away from their teammate who is about to score a goal! Another thing that should be highlighted on Amazon's page for this book is that it is only 23 pages. Half of these pages are diagrams of a soccer field listing positions using some old fashioned naming scheme. This is definately a book that if I had come across in a brick-and-mortar store, I would have read cover to cover in two minutes and never bought."
5,An Enjoyable Read,"This is a book that anyone can pick up and enjoy; it manages to maintain the same level of excitement and enjoyment throughout. I found it difficult to put down and I was disappointed when it ended. The book introduces characters that will make an impact on even the lightest of readers. The only real criticism that I would make of the book is that perhaps at times it skips over situations that needed to be developed a little further giving the story more depth. However, all in all this is still a fantastic novel and I look forward to the sequels. Buy it you won't be disappointed."
1,Wrong book,This book came and it was the wrong one. The picture of the book was the one i needed but it ended up that i got the edition that was before the one in the picture.
3,Out of the ashes and into the fire.,I ordered the CD for 2 songs that I do like. The rest I was not real happy with.For a big recording artist the sound is very poor. One song you can even hear background noise. Dont care for any of the other songs. I liked the last song and thats it. We all miss Waylon. SORRY.
2,Colter,Heard Ms Colter on an NPR interview. Sang one or two cuts from this CD and thought I'd try it. They must have been the best because most songs are just OK.
1,Needs a good patch kit,"Looked great, used it the first night and I had a small problem, no, it was actually a small hole. I called the company, haven't heard back. Think I will film the leak and upload it. If anyone has a good name for my little production let me know"
4,Ursec urinal is pretty good but not 100% spillproof.,"I am disabled and have used bedside urinals for years to avoid bathroom trips at night. I like the Ursec model for its large capacity (well over 1 liter if kept upright), see-through-ability, and wide flat bottom for stability. I haven't liked that it doesn't completely live up to its ""spillproof"" claim, nor that it came with no user instructions for setup. It arrived with two caps, one red and one white (packed inside the bottle with the spout) with no indication of what each is for, since they obviously differ. I found that the red cap leaks easily so I don't understand why it is shown in the illustration. The white cap will fit tightly but can also leak a little if not completely tightened or the bottle is turned on end. Also, If the one-liter max. recommended capacity is exceeded the contents can leak out through the spout if bottle is turned over, or upside down."
1,movie,there is nothing to learn from this movie...there is nothing to learn from this movie...there is nothing to learn
1,sex education gonna wrong.,"Is just audio and a Powerpoint slide show of sex terms. Follow by a ""big"" girl ranting and sex and a dreadlock guy cook and talking about what we all already know."
1,Useless,This video is useless. The individuals explaining how to give or receive oral sex are useless on several different levels. They needed to have porn stars explaining how to administer oral sex and have video footage of those directions.
1,No pun intended,"It sux. Sorriest video I have ever seen from Amazon. Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto. Girl is speaking to someone on her cellphone while she records her ""expert"" advice. WTF?Amazon, you have really lost credibility points on this one."
1,boring,it sucked it went on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on thhen I got tired of watching.and that was the first 10 min.
2,"Not good, poorly organized.","I really don't like this book. It was the text for the Communications Circuits class I just took, so I had to use it, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.Like most other Springer books, they seem to have taken what might have been a good text and cut it down so much that it's confusing and downright painful to read.The one thing in particular that drives me nuts is that since the pages are so small and the book is so short, they frequently reference figures in the text that are as much as 5 pages before or after the actual text describing the figure, so you find yourself endlessly flipping pages. On top of this, most of the figures are SPICE simulations, and when they reference specific elements in a circuit, say ""resistor 1"", the figures don't even have labels on the elements- so you have to read the accompanying netlist to figure out which thing they are talking about.Don't buy this. Springer sucks."
3,Not as it looks,"Although the poster was shipped promptly, when I opened it the print looked much more orange and pink and not as crisp as it appears in the original add."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this eye cream after reading the good reviews on Amazon. I'm using it twice a day, for at least one month and I haven't noticed any difference in the skin around my eyes. After applying the cream, the skin feels moisturized, but after 2 hours I can feel getting dry again. No difference in the fine lines around the eyes or the color of the skin. Waste of money..."
2,Float switch questionable`,"2 months after installation, pump malfunctioned and required that the float switch be manually cycled in order to function. If I had not also installed a battery backup pump I would have had a flooded level."
5,Great pump,"Physically the same size as the 1/3 horse pump I replaced, this pump is quieter. Given the horsepower rating, it seems to pump the water at a faster rate while being quieter. Though the lifetime warranty allows only one replacement, it's in essence getting two pumps for the price of one. I would highly recommend this pump as Wayne Pumps has been a standard in their industry for quite some time."
5,Satisfied Completely,Wayne 3/4 HP Stainless Submersible Sump Pump #CDU980Fast shipment and quality product with a good price.
2,Poorly researched,"Sorry to see a good idea executed so poorly. The author relied on limited and questionable sources, leading to many mistakes in the history of the company. There are also several misspelled names, typos and incorrectly identified photos, although the photos are quite good as are some of the old ads. That's really the only reason to consider the book, for the photos and old advertising. Just don't waste time reading it as there are other, far better accounts of the company's history."
1,Get Liz Frieds book instead,This book has lots of photos but the one of the orange krate is totally incorrect. The auther should have done his homework and learned about Schwinn Bikes before doing a book on the subject. Instead he used nice photos of incorrectly restored bikes.
5,SINGIN' FROM HER SOUL!!!!,"This work is beautifully produced from the vocal arrangements, to the orchestral arrangements. ""Shine Like You Should"" opens with gorgeous tones. ""Caravan"" is a celebration. The title song ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" which was penned by Peter Allen, is a powerful vocal experience. ""Knowin' My Love's Alive"" is full of complexity and finesse. Most of these songs were penned by Melissa herself. Therefore, each is full of intensity, sensitivity, and soul. If you only have the LP you didn't get the bonus cut ""We Had This Time"" which is a sweet treat. Thanks for the wonderful journey of song, Melissa!"
2,Dated 70's style philly-soul,"Being familiar with most of melissa's other albums,I was dissapointed with DON'T CRY OUT LOUD.While the title track is a great cut,the rest of this album is basically 70's style R&B/soul filler.The production and arrangements here are horribly dated,sounding every bit like a late-70's period piece. On a positive note,it is good to finally see her old Arista albums being reissued on CD, and I am looking forward to the reissue of MELISSA MANCHESTER(1979) and HEY RICKY(1982)(which should be out by early 2003-with bonus tracks).These were 2 of Melissa's best albums.I would also recommend SINGIN'-which is currently available as a japanese import ."
1,Waste of Money,My daughter was so excited to get this and only a month later she offered it up for a garage sale item. The radio listing is really small so it makes it very difficult to tune in a station. The time is in the shape of a circle so the middle digit is larger than the hour and other minute so it's very odd to read. I hoped it would also have a plug but it doesn't and seems to run through batteries about every two weeks. We couldn't get the alarm to work at first and finally figured out you have to press 2 buttons at the same time - it doesn't say this anywhere in the directions. She did like the colors though.
5,Brilliant resource for beginners,"***ONE YEAR UPDATE***Although I have done a few projects; because I am very busy with work/school/family I have long lapses where I don't do much at all. What do I use to remind me and inspire me? Yup, this book! Every time I go back to it, I recall information, and sometimes I see something that I never paid attention to in the first place! I am still pleased with this book and look forward to remembering it again...---------------------------------This is definately the book that inspires the reader to take up the hammer. I am not an armourer, but after reading this book, I have begun my journey. It is loaded with pictures, diagrams, historical and reproduction armour and more! Very easy to read and captivating in its presentation. It is worth every penny, and should be on the shelf of any person that enjoys the art, creation, and romance of armour."
4,A rather useful book,"This is a book on how to build armor. Tools, techniques, materials, workspace needed, cost estimates are all part of it. I make leather armor for re-enactors, so much of what was taught here was not directly applicable. However, there are chapters on how to measure, pattern, and cut. These are useful even if the material used isn't metal but leather. There are even some basic instructions on leatherworking. Overall, a pretty straightforward work. I recommend it for anyone who is interested in armor construction, collecting, or re-enacting."
5,Worth every penny and MORE !!,"Being new to making armor, but a fairly good hand at metalworking overall I found this book to be a ""MUST HAVE "" for anyone serious about making armor. At first I thought the book was expensive, but after reading it, I place it's value along side any ""Tool"" in my shop. It IS a tool, besides being fun and easy to read. It shows specialty tools, procedures, and ideas that would take many years to accumulate on your own ( if you could at all ). Think of this book as another ""Tool"" in your workshop and it becomes a VERY good dollar value. 5-stars and the only ""must have"" armor book I have seen or read."
5,If you are interested in armor reproduction it is a great book to have.,It gives a detailed history on making armor during the middle ages and goes on to discuss armours before then as well. It also explains several techniques on how various pieces of armor was historically made and explains how a person would go about making it himself with a large emphasis on keeping it historically accurate. This is a great book if you are curious about how armor is/was made or if you are a metal smith wanting to know how to make armor. The book does have a small learning curve if you're interested in the latter but don't have any experience because the book is written more for a person that is already a little familiar with metal smithing. Besides that it would be a great reference to have if you are a metal smith or just curious about medieval armor and or metal smithing from a historical perspective.
5,Early snowboard flick! Fear The Ride!,"Well If you like cheezy flicks, or just want to watch some sick old school riding shots. You will love this one. I remember this movie from my early days of shredding and I also remember renting this one from my local hometown video rental store. brought me back! Remeber going out to rent a vhs movie! anyway. Made me laugh so hard, Love the sound effects while the riders are carving or jumping. so friggin funny. classic shred movie!"
2,It was a toss up!,"Who were the rivals? The grandfathers? Who were the main hero and heroine? There were so many main characters in this story I had to read the back of the cover to find out.It was an OK read but I have enjoyed JJ's books more which did not deal with the Blackthorne and Grayhawks. Still, it was fairly interesting and left us to wonder what the next episode will bring which continues Clay and Libby's story."
2,What Happened to the old Joan Johnston?,"I too am a hugh Joan Johnston fan. I own all of ther other books. But I was highly disappointed with this novel. Please don't judge her by this book. This is the first thriller romance novel she has attempted. The story was not engaging, and the characters lacked depth and their relationships were not beliveable. The passion and excitement just wasn't there. I hate to give her a bad review because all of her other books are so great. Try any of her other books and see the real Joan Johnston and why she is a bestselling author."
5,"Fast-paced, romantic, suspenseful - Overall Excellant Read","I highly recommend this book to any Nora Roberts fan, BUT first read The Cowboy, The Texan, The Loner, and The Price (all by Joan Johnston). This was the first Joan Johnston book I ever read, which hurried me to read more. After reading this book, I went on to read the rest of the Blackthorne/Creed/Grayhawk stories (I only wish I had read them first and then this one). I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and would definitely say that Joan Johnston's novels are up to speed with Nora's books. Every single one of them is interesting and has made me want to read more, sometimes I wish the stories would continue a little longer. I recommend all of the Blackthorne books and her Bitter Creek series. I am finally about to read The Next Mrs. Blackthorne."
2,I have every single book she' s ever written BUT...,"I was a little disappointed in this book. AND I'M A HUGE JJ FAN. So it was really hard to write that last line. I don't know, it just didn't have the same magic as the first three. Even the Price wasn't that great. I mean it's not that they're bad, it's just getting too "" who done it"" for me. I guess I'm not a big muder mystery fan, maybe that's my problem. It's worth reading, I guess. But I threw it away after I finished it because I was so disappointed (and I have kept every single one of her other books). The Loner, The Cowboy and the Texan were awesome. I definetly suggest those. The Hawks Way books are awesome and all of her ones are awesome. Please believe me I'm a huge JJ fan, just kind of sad on this one, hate to give bad review, just being honest."
3,Cute puzzle,"I purchased this for my 21 month old daughter, my 5 yr old seemed more interested in it. It's cute, durable, and the price is nice. I think she'll be more interested in it in a few more months."
2,It's like... um...,"A really homely, epileptic, emotionally mute girl spends her spring break with mom and a friend in her hometown. She goes to a few parties where other homely girls congregate. Her boyfriend breaks up with her but she doesn't say anything. It's a fine line between trying to show the inner emotions of someone without dramatic dialogue and showing that someone is emotionally dysfunctional. This one veers too far toward the latter.Also, the dialogue between the characters makes them seem like Middle School students, not college. I mean, this guy tells his friend that he's been hanging out with this girl for a few months and he thinks he ""likes"" her and they almost kissed... but not quite. How old are these people? It's very hard to feel empathy towards these do-nothing characters. They are boring. To live an entire sexless week with these people in which no one has any conversation of meaning or depth... is truly, sadly average."
2,Nothing ever happens,Some unexceptional people spend most of the movie talking about their relationships and some trival matters. That's about it.
2,Hey,"This film is fairly recent. It was very hard for me to finish watching it on account of how slow the pacing of the film was. Ivy and her friend Al come home for summer break. They hang out, go to a few meaningless boring parties, and talk. Ivy has a few epileptic episodes. Her boyfriend breaks up with her over the phone. Her mother is always working at the dance studio. ""Hey.....Hey.....Hey....Hey, ok bye"" composes the majority of her phone conversations. Ivy is basically limited on things to do and people to do them with. Her life over the summer had been so boring to the point where she actually wanted to EXPLODE. They best thing that came from Ivy's break was her new relationship with her friend Al. Unfortunately, I think many girls can relate to the character of Ivy. A lot of white college kids are really sheltered and don't do anything. Ivy's life is a sad example of that."
5,bigger and sturdier than it looks,Picks up dirt nicely. It's quite large and can tolerate rough treatment. It's larger and sturdier than it looks in the picture.
4,Only one failing...,"Like everyone else says the rubber edge works great, it fits most brooms, etc. The only problem is that I liked to leave it on my broom while I sweep, so that when I get to the other end of the room, I still have it. But it tends to fall off during sweeping. So you have to take it off and move it around."
3,It's better than okay...,"The problem? It doesn't clip securely onto the matching Good Grips broom. It sort of swings back and forth, so you can't sweep with it on, the way you can with the Libman broom and pan set. Otherwise, it's a good dustpan."
5,thank you Stacy,"While the Bridget Jones genre of books is entertaining, I as a 40+ single woman couldn't relate to a lot of those books. I vaguely remembered living like that but it seems like a life time ago. Stacy writes for those of us who are single, over 40, somewhat satisfied and somewhat not with our lot in life. It is humorous while at the same time insightful and thought provoking. She writes things the rest of us are afraid to even admit we think. I hope to read more from her soon."
1,I don't think so,"Great title; poor excuse for a book: childish, pointless and self-satisfied in its ""wackiness."""
2,I was waiting for the author to die by the end,"I am surprised that this book earned the high rating that it did. I found it only occasionally funny, and Horn's obscession with death was depressing. She even failed to make me sad when her cat did indeed die. Another whiney ""My life is going by and I don't have anyone"" book. Boring- I'd pass."
2,Not really about cats,"If you like to read cat memoirs, this is only marginally a cat memoir. Two thirds of it is really about Ms. Horn and her obsession with researching cemeteries and interviewing old people about dying. And selling her Internet bulletin board. And the results of surveys she takes on the bulletin board. I was bored and skipped over most of that to get to the cat parts, which were sad because her cats are sick and one dies. We never get closure about the other one.I didn't think it was very good, or of interest to much of a readership, but now I'm even more inspired to write my cat memoir book because if she could get this published by St. Martin's Press, I should be able to get mine published because it is really about cats."
5,Nothing Left to Want For,"The reviewer from Ottawa says pretty much what I would say, as I lived through Dee Clark's career and saw him once in 1962 in Memphis with Barbara George, the REAL Drifters, etc. The only thing missing in the other review is that there was ANOTHER unmentioned hit called ""Just Keep it Up"". It was indeed a hit; I remember it well, and I still have the listenable vinyl 45. Otherwise, the man from Ottawa has it right. This and no other is the Dee Clark CD to own if you dig his music."
3,"carl, sam and sam vids","carl was just ok; sam was only just ok-best part was his brief phone call. 2 vids were ok. it was just ok to see sally m. on there;thats it. i liked s.k. live-aka break. the rules and s.k. fam. ent. hr. best so far. but want funnier than them yet. oh, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
2,Banned... You mean Bland!,This show was done in the early 90's and you could tell. Overall it was a weak stand-up. I can only compare it to when I saw him at his peak in 1994 when he was probably the best Comic around.
2,"Some good ideas, over-done and off balance.","There are some good project-ideas in this book but for me the results are unattractive, overloaded with flowers and accents and not balanced. I would not want to make very many of these as shown although there are helpful tips on ""how to"" that I can use. I was disappointed."
4,THERE WAS A YOUNG . . . . FROM . . . .,"Without missing a beat, THE NEW LIMERICK continues what THE LIMERICK started. The 2750 limericks in this second volume of limericks are every bit as raunchy, erotic, and irreverent as were the 1700 in the first volume. Believe it or not, I found one that could be published on these pages. (It was the only one, I think.)""Here are neatly turned odes of small span,Much concerned with our bodily plan,. . . . . . . And the intercorporeal. . . . . . . Highly sensorialLove-life of woman and man.""That's the clean one, You'll have to read the book for the other 2749."
4,A golden oldie,"Gerhard Husch was one of the greatest performers of German Lieder. He was prominent in the 1930s, when this genre was not as popular as it is today. Like Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and his own contemporary, Heinrich Schlusnus, Husch was a baritone."
2,Col. Bob disappoints,"Col. Bob may have the background to make this training DVD work, but the rag-tag bunch of folks he apparently rounded up on the beach is a real detractor. Not to be taken seriously."
5,MORE LIVE ALBERT,"I have had this CD for a few years the sound quality is great, Albert seems to be in top form here. If you're a true Albert fan, you will enjoy this one, I have everything of his I can get my hands on. But Albert live recordings are always a treat, so give this one a try."
4,SB TODDLER BED,My child loved this bed when he first saw it. He loves to sleep in it. It wasn't that easy to put together though-needs 2 people to do this. Pretty sturdy as my 2yo likes to jump and stand on his bed.
3,Painted Wood??,"The bed is listed as having painted wood headboard and footboard. Not only is it not wood but you have to put your own stickers on. It is blue plastic with yellow metal frame. It is still cute, just not what I expected"
5,Excellent,My son is just so excited about his Sponge Bob bed. He climbs in and out every second thus showing how much he likes it. I like it because it is low and no accidental falling off and hurting himself.
3,"It tells you how, but not why","Core JavaServer Faces, by David Geary and Cay Horstmann, is a decent introduction to JavaServer Faces. But it's really just a ""how-to"" book: probably half the book is simply code listings, which are available online. Why waste the paper?Once you get JSF installed into your servlet container, the book does an acceptable job of explaining how to perform most tasks. But it doesn't go into enough detail on the background behind JSF and comparisons to other technologies (raw JSPs, struts, etc.). It needs more ""why"", not just ""how to"".If you want to know what to do, and why you should do it, read JavaServer Faces by Hans Bergsten (one of the Apache Tomcat developers, and contributor to JSP 2.0, JSTL, and JSF)."
5,The best book on JavaServer Faces,"This is the best book on the market to date on JSF. This book is all about getting you up to speed with this new Java technology and being productive. If you are a J2EE web developer, you will be able to use and reuse Java components off the shelf in your Java application. The book clearly shows you how to employ JSF user interface components and also explains why and how to employ these new JSF features compared to using JSP. I strongly recommend that you do all the JSF examples in each chapter. It's a very good book on a great subject."
1,Certainly not as good as authors other books,"I purchased this book, in part due to the reputation ofthe Sun ""Core"" book series; and in part due to thereputation and work of the authors previous titles.The book is not at all intuitive, and seems to jump rightinto deploying JSF. If you are a HIGHLY experiencedJ2EE programer, Apache/Tomcat application administrator,then maybe this book is for you. If not, then I wouldrecommend looking elsewhere.Not only is the book lacking in context, but what is worse,is that the JSF 1.1 specification documents (available on-linefor free from http java dot sun dot com / j2ee / javaserverfaces)are better written, and more complete.Again, I would recommend another title (none of whichI have read), or the JSF specification itself. If youare like me, and hate reading 800 + pages on-line,then I would recommend downloading and printing out theJSF documentation."
3,Could just be me.,"Product is easy to read, good instruction booklet, and fairly simple to use, but I cannot get a good blood pressure reading. I've taken my pressure using this cuff and then had a nurse friend of mine using a BP cuff around the bicep take a reading and where she gets a normal reading, I have yet to get a systolic reading below 180 or a diastolic under 110. I've got to assume that if I am getting readings this bad every day and they are correct I would have had a heart attack by now. When I go to the doctor's the readings are invariably between 120-130/70-90. The problem could very easily be me, and I have large wrists so don't go just by my judgment."
3,Device broke after 20 days - Vendor refunded purchase,"Great vendor, not so great product as it broke after only 20 days of gentle use. Vendor was very responsive and promptly refunded purchase price. I possibly had a bad product, hopefully other units perform much better."
2,It's ok....I guess.,"No complaints about the flat side. It's flat and it distributes heat well. I bought it more for the ridged side though, ad that's where this product loses me. Food gets stuck in the ridges and just won't come off. Plus the coating is starting to flake off, so I dont want to cook on it anymore."
5,Inspector Lynley Mysteries series 3,Have purchase all of the series. This set was in great condition and was sold at a very reasonable price.
3,Great series but annoying lines on top of screen,"I love the Inspector Lynley Series but couldn't watch this series because of moving, annoying lines on the top of the screen on all four installments. I've obtained this series from two different sources now and both have these lines."
1,This is a Shame...Michael Schenker did not approve this release,"Bob Kulick and Cleopatra Records, but mainly Bob Kulick released with compilation without Schenkers approval, or consent. Schenker did record the guitar parts, but everything else was plotted and concieved without his knowing and it shows. This is not an MSG release, this is a star-studded affair which happens to feature Schneker on all lead guitar on all tracks. Bob Kulick is a favorite to do these types of tribute releases, but this one was not with Michael Schenker's participation on the album. Schenker had no idea nor was told who is to perform on each song. While there are some good performances, it's a letdown and does not warrant to being either an MSG or a ""real"" Michael Schenker release. Bob Kulick and Cleopatra records are responsible for the misrepresentation of MSG on this slimeball release."
3,"They screwed Schenker on this one, but he's still The Man!","This is a misrepresented CD;Schenker put his trust in Kulick and was shafted. BUT...let me say this about Schenker. I had a compadre,a guitar player that had never heard Michael before,and he saw this laying about and stuck it in his personal CD player...and I didn't get it back 'till 3 days later. PROOF that everything he does has musical,guitar God merit.Having said that,buy any OTHER CD by Schenker first and this one last.The band sounds like a sophmoric cover band,only MS shines..."
4,One of the better modern biographies of Lord Nelson,"There have been three biographies of Nelson written in the past few years that are worth reading; Tom Pocock's, Christopher Hibbert's, and this one by the Howarths. Pocock's is in many ways the most enjoyable to read, Hibbert's has some new information, but ""Nelson: The Immortal Memory"" is my own favorite and a good selection for someone just beginning to find out about the contradictory, fascinating man who was unquestionably the greatest fighting admiral who ever lived and whose memory lives on in the modern Royal Navy."
1,dont buy this overpriced!!!!!!!!!,you can get a mutch better camera for $300 dollars+and the lens froze wont fix at allit says screen error
4,The first book I bought to learn how to design,"I worked very hard on a child's lace-trimmed sweater from a pattern only to be very disappointed by the result. The dropped shoulders had no shaping and a clumsy-looking knitted seam, the back rode up, and the button band was too narrow to control the curl of the edge. That was when I thought, ""I could do better than this."" I decided to start designing my own stuff. ""Designing Knitwear"" has a lot to offer someone who wants to design their own knitwear. Newton's ideas are inspiring. I don't particularly like the majority of projects she gives directions for, but I learned a lot about the design process from her, and about producing looks that are way beyond the run-of-the-mill. One thing I don't like about the book is that Newton takes the sewing approach, with the flat-knit pieces sewn together, the edges sewn on, etc. I like to keep sewing to a minimum in knitted garments."
4,Inspirational,"I am only a beginning knitter but I've checked this book out of the library several times in the past couple of years. The photos are gorgeous; even the pictures of swatches are eye-candy. This is not a book of patterns, rather, it is a sort of 'how-to' book for design inspiration using various sources; old photographs, coutour fashion, sewing patterns, and of course beautiful yarns and fibers. Don't pass this up if you are not ready to design your own knits. It will inspire you to keep knitting and treat yourself to some gorgeous yarns even if it is only one skein to make swatches from. This book is as much about the process, or journey as it is about the finished product. I was tickled the first time I checked out the book and discovered the author was from Rhode Island. Since then, I've wondered if she still lives here and holds workshops."
5,fascinating and just what i was looking for!,"I wanted to learn how to design, and I tend to need plenty of visuals when I'm learning something, so this book is wonderful to have. Tons of pictures and the text is clear and informative of course."
2,Not so impressed.,I'm beginning to realize I'm not a big Deborah Newton fan - even though I have several of her books. This one was disappointing because I felt there was a lot of fluff that made not difference.
1,too wordy,"I found this book much to wordy to actually be helpful. It seems like the author was more interested in being witty and cracking jokes than in providing cold, hard facts. Although some of the stories are entertaining, I would have welcomed something with a more serious and mature tone. I found myself skimming through most of the anecdotes, in an effort to get to the real information."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this knife for my mother as a Christmas present but returned it after seeing how cheaply it's made. Although I read the product description and knew it was designed as a more economical alternative to Wusthof's Classic line of cutlery, I decided to give it a chance because my mom isn't that much into cooking. I didn't test it out, but it's evident by the look and feel that the quality and craftsmanship is far below what I expected, and I'm disappointed in Wusthof for selling such a low quality product. I own several pieces from their Classic line of knives, includingWüsthof Classic 7-Inch Hollow Edge Santoku Knife, and absolutely love them. So, don't be scared away from the Wusthof name, just stick to the Classic line and don't buy this knife."
5,An awesome knife,This knife has all but replaced my collection of chef's knives. It cuts everything from cheese to tomatoes effortlessly and smoothly. It keeps its edge well and only needs a touch with the sharpening steel every few days to maintain that edge.Highly recommended.
3,Pretty good but ..,"I bought this knife a few months ago and started using it with gusto. It was fun and a welcome change from the other knives I was using. But I noticed that within a couple of months, the edge has become dull. It still cuts carrots etc relatively easily but it is dull enough not to get the initial cut - like the edges of onions or carrots. So I find myself using a serrated knife to start the process and then start using this one.So, I am disappointed and I use this only randomly on veggies that were already easy to cut before I got this knife."
2,Light Weight,If you are looking for a heavier knife then you will be disappointed. This is not the usual heavy knife that you would expect. I was disappointed but decided to keep the knife as it works well for most applications. Lighter weight than I am used to.
1,Don't count on the Wusthof name,"In spite of the Wusthof name, these stamped blade knives are junk! I tried to cancel this order two days before it shipped but was told to send it back after receiving it. After paying shipping and restocking it's just not worth the trouble!"
5,Great product,"This knife is well-made, very easy to use, and shipped exactly as described. I have a chef's knife by the same company, and I use it all the time, but this one is the perfect size for small chopping jobs and I actually pull it out more often than the chef's knife now."
5,nice knife,it's a very good knife.. even its cut me when i try to open the box... the packaging off the product also very good.. and all the thing I order come in a very good condition.. just love it..
1,Drop Dead Terrible quality.,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. The quality of this knife is the worst I've ever seen. Poor quality steel, poor balance, but they made the knife look good so people would buy it. Terrible! I would never buy another Wusthof knife again. I'm sure they have some good quality knives, but their reputation is spoiled by the quality in this knife as far as I'm concerned."
3,Last chance,"I have to transfer 35 hours of digital8 video from tape to DVD and my old camcorder gave up. Repair would have been more expensive than buying this new one, which I did. Glad to se that it was still possible to get a european PAL capable D8 camcorder to save the first 15 years of my doughters behavings!!"
4,Interesting for nondivers too,"The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass explores the history, mystery, and tragedy surrounding this vessel. During her time as a naval submarine in World War II, a fire claimed the lives of 25 crew members. She was decommissioned, converted to a cargo carrier and finally, in 1945 deliberately sunk near Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island, USA. To learn more of this intriguing tale and visit her remains join the salty Captain Lou, his crew and fellow divers as they journey through New England waters and take you 160' beneath the sea."
4,Fine Video,"As a professional photographer and an avid scuba diver, I find this film to be professionally produced and entertaining. It is a nice addition to my DVD library."
5,Excellent and eye openning.,Dr Fee makes you think as you read this compilation of papers and lectures.
3,Not up to Wusthof quality,"I just received this item. But if you are used to the quality of Wusthof knives be prepared for a let down. This is the Gourmet line not the Classic.Metal portion is a metal stamping with only the front/back surfaces polished. The outside edges and the edges in the slots are still rough. A good place for bacteria to grow.However, I suspect it will work well."
4,Wonderful all-purpose spatula,"I have used this spatula for pancakes, toast, and omelets. It has served me well in all three scenarios. The handle is not heatproof, and for the price, it really should be, thus the four stars."
5,Great spatula!,"I purchased this spatula in April 2011 as a result of the Cooks Illustrated review. I have not been disappointed in any way. I use it several times each week. It does a fabulous job of getting ground beef quite small for tacos, etc. Also, when cooking bulk sausage to a crumble, it does this quite easily. I would not use it in a nonstick pan."
1,Poor product,"I have owned this for two years.The vacuum is heavy, awkward and cumbersome. There is no easy way to transport it up and down stairs. It is a filty mess to empty and has been in the repair shop twice because it keeps clogging up. The repair shop states that it is not well designed. The manufacuter will not stand behind the product."
3,Phil Fondacaro makes this film,"Phil Fondacaro is in a ton of Full Moon and related flicks, i love the fact that not only is he a great actor, he wont take a role that makes fun of little people and that's pretty cool considering that there probably isn't alot of roles for little people and the fact that he hasn't sold out is awesome.The movie is just okay, i can say that great time was taken on the make-up for a low budget. In the end its Phil who gives this movie heart, i've seen him in everything from Full Moon flicks to Sabrina The Teenage Witch, hes just a cool guy to watch on film."
2,the creeps,"Ok I know its a full moon movie so don't expect a block buster cast or even story ,but it was shot really good and it did have story to it which made it fun in a way. I thought this movie could of been played on tv like the ifc channel. It could even be a good monster movie for kids to watch. I really thought it was funny how they named a couple full moon movies in the movie. Good way to make fans check out your other movies. No matter what I will always be a fan of full moon/charles band movies and products."
4,A Gift For Full-Mooniacs!...,"If you're a fan of other FULL MOON productions (Puppet Master, Blood Dolls, Hideous!, Head Of The Family, Shrieker, etc.) in general, or Charles Band (writer of Puppet Master, director of Hideous!, founder of Full Moon) in particular, you'll love THE CREEPS. If not, you may be in for a miserable time. I love these goofy movies myself, so this one fits right into my twisted collection. A librarian (Rhonda Griffin from Hideous!) must fend off both the advances of her overly-attentive boss (Kristen Norton), and the devilish plans of Count Dracula (Phil Fondacaro from Blood Dolls). Can she defeat the tiny prince of darkness and his mob of mini-monsters? Let us hope so! Though ultra-silly and slow in spots, at only 75 mins., the story zips right along! Add it to your freak folio..."
1,BAND ON THE RUN,"Director Charles Band has given us some strange but fun movies such as THE REANIMATOR, but in this one, I think he's gone off the deep end. In the VIDEO ZONE feature, he extols his cast saying how good actors they are? Charles, please....there's not one solid performance in this whole movie, and your boasting of the originality of having the monsters three feet tall is ridiculous. How frightening can these clowns be? Rhonda Griffin and Kristin Norton are the worst actresses I have ever seen, and Bill Moynihan is atrocious. Only Justin Lauer as the hero comes across with any kind of screen presence. This one's not even funny enough to be considered camp.Is it time for the Full Moon to set? With movies like this one, I'd say so."
1,This is an EDITED version of a good book,"If you want to read George MacDonald, one of my all time favorite authors, then read him in the original. He is wonderful and inspiring. I fail to understand why anyone would want to read an edited version instead of the words and phrases as the author intended."
5,The best...,George MacDonald is far and away my favorite author. What joy to read his works for the first time! How I wish I could read them in the Scottish dialect they were originally written in. His portrayal of the attributes of his various characters rivals that of Dickens in its complexity and depth.
4,Charming and delicous!,"This is a charming cookbook. The recipes are genuine ""lowcountry"" recipes from this part of South Carolina and the little notes and asides on each page are very helpful. I especially liked the fact that most of the recipes do not call for too very many ingredients. I happen to know the ladies whose recipes are represented and they are all fabulous cooks. To be able to get my hands on all of these at one time is wonderful. Another thing I really enjoyed were the introductions to the four seasons represented in the book written by Ken Burger, the authors husband. Buy this book and use it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"UMMM, I tried to rate it a '0', not available!What they don't mention (ah, they are circumspect!) is that EVERY picture is in glorious black and white. Yes, you could do as well with a trip to the library and use their photocopier!"
2,Explosion,"I used this ball with exercise video 4 times. On the 5th day, my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded, sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole."
3,GoFit Exercise Ball,"This ball is a substitute for a previous GoFit exercise ball that I got as a gift. The first one rolled out of the garage and disappeared when it was not tethered. The ball I am reviewing is a much cheaper version and less sturdy, but it is serviceable. The first ball cost $40 as opposed to $16 and was very durable and inflated well. This ball is flimsy compared to the first one and was more difficult to inflate. But if price is a consideration, it would serve OK."
4,Great Workout,This stability ball has worked great for me. Dont be afraid to give it enough air to work right. Very good product.
3,"""Pricey"" 12 min. Video","The DVD carries some good information on MRSA. It is current and easy to understand. However, it is very expensive for less than 12 minutes of video. You might think there is an hour of video time - 60 Minutes - Superbug. Instead, it is less than 12 minutes of actual footage from the 60 Minutes program. It is overpriced at $17.95 plus shipping. I paid $25 for the DVD and it works out that it is >$2.00 a minute. Otherwise, the information is timely."
4,An enjoyable book,"The book is a quick read, and exciting. I am not an avid fiction reader, but this is a compelling story. The author does a good job transporting you to his imaginary town. The story is well thought out, filled with surprises and keeps you guessing to the end. I have recommended this to others and all have enjoyed it. I look forward to the next book."
2,Where's the meat?,"At the price ([price]on my door step), I expected to find something that put all the xUML pieces together, that was worthy of the author's name. What I did find, though, was a book that provided only the most basic information and examples of the topic, and very incomplete at that. You can find xUML white papers freely available on the web which literally contain 100 times more detail and usable technical information. Not only were many parts of the model missing (specifically key service domains), but key elements such as bridge definitions, use cases, etc., were also missing.Also, there were many self-serving references to both Leon's company and a future book on xUML. Hopefully, THAT book will contain the useful detail that is missing from this one.For anyone who is considering purchasing this book, wait for the next one and locate the white papers on the web!"
4,"An excellent, yet somewhat incomplete model...","This book was an excellent reference for me as I am still learning the Shlaer/Mellor method, but I really needed to see the Device I/O service domain and the Transport domain to complete my personal project. Hopefully, you can get this out in the next version, as promised, so the model starts ""clicking"". Well written and documented."
5,Balanced satire,"One thing that is engaging about ""Number 10"" is that it is not a shallow political satire that many Americans are accustomed to reading. (After all, this is British politics, and to expect the average American to understand half the jokes in a typical non-American satire is asking a lot.) With a minimum of acquaintance with the British government, one can get a very healthy dose of ripping humour from Sue Townsend's book. If you know a little more than the average, you can get some of the subtle jokes. My favorite is where actor Brian Blessed is quoted as saying that someone was loud.That is a tame example of the humor in ""Number Ten"". The book is for adults and requires both an appreciation for British humour and an objective observation of political views and all their shortcomings. The story is not entirely funny or satirical. It has legs of its own, so it's interesting regardless of the political content, and it is worth your time to read."
5,This reliable watch is a great value,"I bought this watch a couple years ago and I'm still very happy with it. I do not like wearing wrist watches, so the clip is ideal. As for the various functions (compass, temperature, altitude, etc.), they have all worked great. The temperature readings are correct if you place the watch away from your body heat and give it enough time to equilibrate. The compass works well too for quick readings (and you can regain compass mode as many times as you like if the display is not long enough for you). Like any multiple-function watches, it has issues, but compared to the Suunto watches that I have owned, this one is a much better value for the price."
3,The great Inspector Ghote continues holding interest,"H.R.F. Keating's Inspector Ghote mysteries are criminally underrated and unknown to too many mystery fans. They concern police inspector Ghote (working in India, natch) who differs greatly from the typical detective hero: he's a cog in a vast, often indifferent machine, polite, reserved, carefully trying not to offend anyone. His seeming servility is a great contrast to most of the great, individualist detectives. His environment, so foreign to the typical mystery, is so well described and written about so well, that the series is not just a bunch of well-written mysteries (that they are) but also a visit to a different world of mysteries, as cliched as that sounds.it's still a superior book."
2,Wheels are week,This unit is not very strong for full loads. Wheels are very flimsy and one broke off after the third use.
5,Awesome Keyboard,"I too am sick of those membrane keyboards that come with computers lately. They aren't so great for accurate typing. However, this keyboard is great. It has that nice clickiness when you type, but not overwhelmingly loud. The price is great and looks pretty cool on my desk."
3,This keyboard,"Ordered this keyboard because I needed a replacement for an old OEM keyboard that exploded on contact with my nephew.First thing I noticed was the tacky letter\ print on the keys. Second thing was ""where the crap did my backspace go?"". Then I foun\d it. Basically have to spell perfectly or you will probably miss the backspace key and hit the randomly placed backsla\sh ke\y instead.It does NOT have a clicky key press sound unless maybe you hit really hard. That was the whole reason I purchased it, based on a review from another person who had said it had that great sound. Than\ks for lying, bro.Other than that, it feels sturdy. It is a keyboard and will serve its purpose. I'll bring my nephew over for further tests.Probably won't buy another one of these keyboards. Oh and MADE IN CHINA."
1,Space bar gave up within 2 months,"I had an old KeyTronic which lasted for years, this one, not so much..Now I have to buy again a keyboard.S."
5,Great Book,This book is a great read. I was drawn in from start to finish. It is a great way to tell the story of Germany though the experiences of a house.
5,Wonderful LP,"Saosin truely proves itself to be a strong force in the music industry with its first self-titled full length release. Between the sharp guitar riffs of Justin Shekoski and Beau Burchell, to the fierce bass line of Chris Soreson, the expert drumming of Alex Rodriguez, and the wide vocal range of Cove Reber. The album truely shows off their musicianship in this long awaited album. The album moves from its post-hardcore roots (fronted by Anthony Green) in songs such as ""Come Close"" and back to its now mostly area-rock type feel shown in the single ""Voices"". The differnces between the ""Translating the Name"" EP and this album are immense but still are the same in many aspects. Though the band has been through various line-up changes they still manage to keep a strong focus on their music. Also despite them being on a major label they still seem to have a very loyal fanbase that stays true to the band as well.So in conclusion, good band + good fans = good times. :)"
4,Self Titled,"What I noticed first, were the changes made to older songs like Voices (previously I wanna hear another fast song) and Bury Your Head. You have to commit that Capitol has had its spoon in this bowl of soup. I was waiting something heavyer, more simple and darker but as a totality I'm very very glad for the boys and happily suprised about the record.timppis"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"A pretty unprecedented example of a band who have gathered a fervent underground scene following while basically playing bland commercial alt-rock. Their first ep sounded like an emoified version of Linkin Park, their second sounded virtually exactly like Hoobastank, and yet all these scenester kids who scoff at those bands were all over it. The best reference point for what they're doing on this debut album they finally got around to recording after two eps with a two year gap between them is Yellowcard's latest, but it could just as easily be 100 other faceless overproduced bands, except for the odd way one drum is mixed so much louder than the rest."
5,The first and the best!!!!,"AWESOME CD!!! I bought the limited ed. with the bonus dvd the first day it was out, even though i was on vacation! Great band who i've been following since their beginning and they never cease to amazing me!!!"
5,You won't want to download these songs....,"...it's quicker to buy the CD. This is one of those rare CD's that is actually worth the price. No one or two ""radio"" songs, but a CD you can put in, turn up, and enjoy in it's entirety. There isn't a bad song to be found....definitely one of my favorites closing out 2006."
3,Saosin Falls Short of Expectations,"I heard ""You're Not Alone"" and ""Voices"" all over the internet and the radio, and immediately fell in love with the band. However, while there were some impressive songs on this album, there weren't enough of them. The album fell short of my expectations by seemingly throwing a handful of good-but-not-great songs in between a few instant hits. Though it may not be an instant classic in my eyes, I suggest purchasing the album anyhow. It's worth the listen. My personal favorites included ""It's Far Better to Learn"" , ""Voices"", and ""You're Not Alone"".My grade distribution/break-down is as follows:1. It s Far Better to Learn 5/52. Sleepers 3/53. It s So Simple 3/54. Voices 5/55. Finding Home 2/56. Follow And Feel 3/57. Come Close 4/58. I Never Wanted To 4/59. Collapse 3/510. You re Not Alone 5/511. Bury Your Head 3/512. Some Sense Of Security 2/5Overall Grade: 42/60 ~3.5 stars"
5,Saosin Review,"The product came in pretty good condition, there was a crack on the case, but it's not the end of the world. I absolutely LOVE this band though! I can't wait to get their other CDs"
5,Never Heard An Album So Good,"Wow! Im was almost speechless after hearing this album for the first time. After waiting SOOO Long, the saosin LP is finally here.And it was worth the wait.The Main attractions here are ""Some Sense of Security"", ""Come Close"", ""Its Far Better To Learn"", ""Sleepers""...Well actually, they are all good!YOU NEED THIS ALBUM!"
3,Overall Not Worth It,"First off I'm a big Saosin fan, Translating the Name IMO is one of the best album's I own(I know it's an EP). I was very much looking forward to this release, but was disappointed by it. No screaming, all the tracks sound the same, 2 or 3 good tracks but no stand outs. I wanted to like it but I just can't. The new lead singer just doesn't do it for me."
5,Saosin Rocks!!!,"I absoutly love this band, I have been waiting forever for them to finally release this album. I deffently recomend that everyone should buy this album, it rocks and I know you will love it!!!"
3,Nothing special,"I am at a loss to explain why this band is so hyped. The only thing that really stands out on this album is the drummer. Other than that, this band sounds like every other trendy band out there in my opinion. I suppose that I may not be in a good position to review this album, as I usually strongly dislike this genre. Overall, the album is solid, but nothing really stands out."
2,This album is pretty bad,"I fell in love with Saosin the first time I heard their EP Translating the Name. The Saosin EP was ok, I wasn't sure how it would turn out as a full album, but this album is terrible. It's overproduced, slower, less original, and just plain doesn't rock like Translating the Name. I've listened to it again and again because often times it takes me a while to get into a new album if it's a bit different, but for me, it's no good. Save your money and go with the new Rise Against or Senses Fail if you really want to rock."
3,A dogged piece of knowledge,"My first impression when I opened the book was really positive. A great number of drawings, diagrams and pictures with text inbetween. The introduction still sounds very aimed and sympathetic. I learned better making my way through the first pages about stability - very dry with lots of graphs and aerodynamic sophistry that I won't ever need as an avionics technician. Later flowchart diagrams presented more questions to me than they would answer when using them with the text as intended. Some portions are very theoretical. I missed pratical examples for some of these scientific statements and explained systems. Well, I think I picked up some usefull things but wouldn't recommend the book for hands-on people - rather for the more theoretical guys that won't ever have to change a wheel."
4,Recommended book,"First, it must be understood that the purpose of this book is to give historical background on Runes and those who have used them. That in mind, this book is invaluable as it provides information not available anywhere else. Again, this book is not meant as a primer, so if that is what you are looking for, I would recommend picking up Runelore, of FUTHARK."
1,llewellyn books: dig deeper,"famous for bastardizing pagan religions into an indistinguishable polyglot, this publisher is by far the worst of the neo-pagan lot...cultural religions were NOT meant to be mixed and pureed togetherplease dig deeper, for your own good"
3,"Nice smell, just not for me.","When I searched for a perfume I was looking for a fresh peach sent. Not sweet, just light and musky. I read the other reviews for this perfume and decided to get it.The perfume was not the peach I was looking for, and gave me a headache. I am sensitive to some perfumes, so I put it back in the box. I ended up giving it to my mom since she liked it. For the price I do not regret getting it, since someone in my family does like it."
3,Less than wonderful,"I am a fan of the Muscle Milk Milk and Oats oatmeals by Cytosport. The product comes in several flavors of which Banana Walnut is one. The banana flavor was detectable but the walnut was understated.My preferred flavor is blueberries and cream.Milk and Oats is in my opinion a healthy product which delivers a good amount of protein and vitamins. It provides a healthy start to any day.One caution with this product. It took me several times making the oatmeal to make it turn out right. It takes a little more effort than add water, stir and nuke."
4,Great stuff,"I love this stuff. Normally I would eat egg whites and oatmeal, like my personal trainer wants me too, but I have a young kid (7) that I have to get ready for school each day, and I never seem to have time for cooking in the mornings. My personal trainer actually put me on to Muscle Milk N' Oats when I decided to to a 2 week road trip and I knew I would have very limited chances to cook. Since then I have been using them every time I need a good breakfast in a hurry (when I don't have time to make egg whites and oatmeal). This stuff tastes great, and you can make it in about 2 minutes or less. I would recommend these to anyone. I love the Maple and Brown sugar flavor. I tried the Vanilla flavor and I didn't like it. I haven't tried the other flavors. I have been eating the Maple and Brown sugar flavor almost every day for about 5 months and I haven't got tired of it."
1,"By far, one of the worst breakfast foods ever...","I've tried Maple Brown Sugar and Banana flavored Muscle Milk and Oats and they are absolutely terrible. I am a big fan of Muscle Milk, but this is an awful way to consume it. It's simply a scoop or so of the Muscle Milk powder with some wimpy, fine oatmeal flakes. Add a little bit of hot water and you've got a super pasty extra strong, hot, pungent soup of protein powder and oatmeal. I couldn't eat the six-pack obviously, so I gave to some friends to try... every verdict from everyone was that it was terrible. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
5,Buyer Beware! NOT THE SAME AS THE OLD AV CABLE!,"Ok, i saw this on amazon a day or two ago, and it looked interesting. I needed a new AV cable for my PS3 anyway, being as it's almost 4 years old. so i order it, $3.99 one-day shipping (Amazing). So I get it, open it, and i think to myself, ""Goddamn it Sony, Damn it..."" The wires are only split about 4 inches down, then it all merges into one cable... now this is a bad thing for me because i have a stereo, and i need the left and right audio wire to be at least 3 feet long, but since it's all basically one wire, i need to go to RadioShack and get some RCA couplers and more wires. If you have a stereo as well, do not do the same thing as me! make sure you buy couplers and wires with to hook up everything with first (Providing you don't have those items already). It's still a nice cable, and i intend to use it, but i wish sony would make it known to their loyal customers of what their product is."
4,connect music,Connected our music organ to the internet so my wife could download more songs that she likes and upgrade the unit
1,Don't even work,"Ordered this cable from ocean reef used can se I thought it'd be cheaper, and it was price and quality wise cable doesn't work I've tried. Few times now and the end has metal strips missing in bad condition and it looks like a ps2 cable def not ps3 horrible buy new for a reason!"
2,Expensive cables.,Cables work fine. I have been using these for over a year.Pros : cable functions as expected.cons : price a little high.
1,Didn't Work in any of my 3 TV's,"I order this item because I use an older TV for playing video games. When I plugged in the cord it fit perfect into the system and into the audio video jacks, but there was no sound or video. I fiddled around with it and plugged it into my brand new Sanyo TV and the same thing happend nothing was working. Could be a defective cord, which is most likely, but think twice about buying this item."
1,Bad Product! Dont Buy This!,"so my friend's TV has burnt out HDMI ports so i bought this cable to play my PS3 on his TV. behold, this piece of crap didnt work at all. what a waste of money this was. thinking maybe it was a bad port on the tv, we hooked it up to an older TV and the sound worked but no video. so we went back to the original TV and hooked up a DVD player using a different yellow/white/red cable to the same port we tried the first time and suprise, suprise....everything worked so it was a bad cable. last time i buy this product"
2,Hear some kind of static noise and little grainy video,When I connect these cables to my PS3 and the old SD TV which only have those 3 composite inputs and tried to play both DVD and BD discs. It works and I could able to see both the video and audio. But I'm disappointed with the little grainy video and some kind of additional static noise been heard. When i tried the same DVD disc with the regular DVD player I don't see any of these issues.
3,"Works fine, not quite a perfect match.","I bought this ignition switch to replace the one on my 1989 Honda Crx Si. I had some trouble getting the large white wire connecter to connect but after straitening some of the pins I managed to get it hooked up. I think the tolerances on the connecter may not be as tight as they should be, so that caused it to not slide in right to begin with.The big issue however was with the small black sensor (blue/white wires) that screws into the ignition housing. The hole in the switch was too small for the screw that came with my old switch, so I had to drill it out a little bit to get a proper fit. As far as I know the switch had never been replaced before so I took a few stars off for problems with fitment."
3,Still not a perfect match...,"As the other reviewer mentioned, the switch that mounts on the side of the steering column has a hole that is too small for the screw (I have a different model CRX).FYI, if you happen to be having trouble getting the steering wheel off on your Honda, the 'H' in the center probably pops off. One of the shop manuals suggests popping off the button/plate for the horn with a crow bar. I do not suggest their method unless you want some permanently warped metal."
4,Love Her Soul,Watched Megan on What Not To Wear and was totally taken by her beautiful voice and the tranformation that she went thru on the show. I immediately went to her web site and listened to the clips from this album and purchased it. Her music has a lot of emotion and soul that really touches me.
3,Not Bad,"It's not bad, but I've heard better. She sounds a lot like Avril Lavigne, which to an extent is good. But at times, she sounds too much like her, which makes her less individual. I saw her on TLC's What Not To Wear. I wanted to hear more of her music before I put an ""Avril wannabe"" label on her. She's better than I thought at first, but still sounds too much like Avril."
5,Long overdue!,An incredible work! I only wish that books of this caliber were available on all the families of birds.This book should be on every bird enthusiast's shelf.
3,Glaring Editing errors mar a great book,"I am very impressed with this book's selection of artists. The problem is some of the images are mismatched, repeated, or noticably missing. I hope these errors will be fixed in a future printing or edition."
4,"""Required"" reading for all Americans especially Southerners.","This historical romance is set in the turbulent War Between the States era. Its emphasis on the major role of Columbia, South Carolina, and of local color details makes it ""required"" reading for all Americans especially Southerners."
3,"Good job, Yankees.","Anyone who's visited Columbia knows exactly why the Union burned it down. What a pit. The books ok, though."
2,Depends on what you call poached,"I've tried all ten power settings and various times on my Panasonic microwave and can not get an acceptable result. For me a poached egg is a soft yoke and firm whites. The opposite occurs when using this simple plastic device that has the quality of a disposable frozen dinner tray. The whites are uncooked and the yoke is grossly over cooked. Explosions occur even when the manufacturer's direction are followed to the letter. The lid doesn't fit and ends up being blown off by exploding eggs making a veritable mess in the microwave. I've gone through six dozen eggs and have yet to find one that is edible. The good news is that my two dogs love this device. Bottom line is that it's a cheap, plastic, Chinese made gimmick that is sure to disappoint anyone who expects a real poached egg."
2,microwave egg poacher,"not sure what I think of this product...I have not reached the ""poached"" stage with it yet...I like egg white cooked and the yolk runny...so far ""well-done"" is the only stage I can find."
2,Doesn't cook evenly,"I never figured out the trick to this product. I tried different amounts of time and wattages in my microwave, but I could never get the eggs to cook evenly or to the consistency I like. I stopped using it after a month or so."
3,Makes great hard boiled eggs,"As many said in other reviews...I can't get the whites cooked without the center getting semi hard...it's great for making hard boiled eggs to toss in tuna salad though...and for the price, sent by prime it's worth it just for that!"
1,Egg What?,It did not do what I had expected. It took forever to get the egg white(s) cooked and then they were rubbery. I would not recommend this product.
3,Poacher,It is OK but cooks yolk too hard and the whites are runny. Can't find the right microwave power to use.
3,EGGS FOR FOUR,"It's ok but we seem to prefer the on the stove method to the microwave method, it is a little quicker, and less mess to clean up, but eggs in the micro just don't seem to work for us."
3,Needs Improvement.,"It's nice that it has 4 slots, but the size needs to be larger in diameter. The eggs turn out too small. I would like to see it with eggs that are english muffin size."
4,It's a good thing!!,"I have only used it a couple of times and need to get the timing down perfectly yet, but it's very easy to use and easy to clean up."
5,Works Great!,Works great! Remember to place 1/2 table spoon of water into each reservoir before adding the egg. Cooks quickly using 1/2 power.
3,egg poacher,"I have experimented with different times and cooking levels, but no matter what I do, by the time the whites are done, the yolks are hard. Also, it is very hard to clean. The dishwasher doesn't get off the stuck-on egg, and if I don't clean it right away, it is difficult to scrub off. In spite of these drawbacks, I use this egg poacher once or twice a week. I don't cook in the mornings, so this is the only way my family gets eggs for breakfast. They don't come out like ""real"" poached eggs, but they are fine for breakfast sandwiches. I cook a whole package of sausage or bacon once a week and keep it in the refrigerator with sliced cheese and sandwich thins. With these ingredients on hand and the egg poacher, I can make egg sandwiches for the family in five minutes."
2,Microwave Egg Poacher,I was very disappointed with this product. They white did not get done and the yolk was hard. A poached egg should have white done and yolk runny. I would not recommend this product if you want a real poached egg.
2,If you like runny eggs....,"If you like runny poached eggs buy this egg poacher. I have tried one egg, two eggs, three eggs. Have tried different times different power on my micro wave. Every time the poached eggs have come out runny or runny and almost hard boiled. But if you do not mind runny eggs, I guess this item would be all right for you. I personally wound not recommend it."
1,depnds on microwave,"This must really depend on your microwave - I saw all the great feedback - but my attempts have yielded exploded crappy eggs. Yes I did the water under and over. Yes, I poked a billion holes in the egg white and yolk - still will explode several times before getting to an edible state. I wouldn't recommend."
3,"Good poacher, BUT for small eggs only",I bought this thing and ignored it for a few months - started using it recently - it is a great gadget - eggs don't stick - BUT its small wells will only accommodate small or bantam eggs; anything larger will overflow.
2,maybe it's ok,As other reviewers have stated it is very hard to get the timing right for a correctly cooked egg. Seems like the times I've used (1000 watt oven)per the instructions left the whites runny. Add as little as 10 seconds and the whites are done but the yolk is overcooked.
2,too small,"it makes the egg into a little ball shape, and its too round in the bottom, so you really can use on english muffin sandwich...any microwave safe, round tupperware would be better then this.this thing is already in the cupboard... way in the back."
2,If you like solid yolks and runny whites . . .,"Maybe it's just not possible to micro-poach an egg (the fat in the yolk causes them to heat faster than the white). The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the material also heats faster than the white, so you end up with an over-cooked yolk surrounded by undercooked white in a ""cup"" of cooked white."
3,Timing difficult,"I am a bit disappointed with this poacher. The eggs don't stick, that's good but it is quite tricky getting the time right. The eggs seem to stay quite runny and before you know it, they are overdone. I hope I will acquire the skills needed to get the eggs perfect!"
4,"Works good, just follow directions","I've been using this on occassion for months and have no problems. Just follow the directions till you get the hang of it and you'll be fine. It does the job well and quickly, but remember...they're nuked eggs and will have that nuked egg taste and texture/feel...they'll never match real poached eggs."
4,About as good as you could expect,"You can't beat a traditionally poached egg; if you're looking for high end dining, you should probably put in the extra time and effort required to achieve perfection. Microwaves yield some inconsistency in heating, particularly if you have no turn-table and are using the high setting to maximize time efficiency, so don't expect perfection, but for something this simple that will poach an egg in under a minute, the results are pretty good."
4,Good for the price,"I use this ball (in the 65cm size) as a ""chair"" for my desk in my office. It took a while to get it up to the right size. The pump it comes with is lousy: it fell apart a couple times, and doesn't have much power. However, it did get the job done. The circumference of the ball is supposed to be 81 inches. I got it up to about 70 inches the first day. After 2 days (including 1 day of sitting on it), I was able to inflate it to the full size. So far I haven't had any problems with leaking. The ball is working great as a chair."
3,"Good for the price, but not infallible","This ball tends to leak a little air, however it comes with a pump and after refilling it is fine again. Overall it is worth the price."
1,Not as advertised,"I purchased the pearl white GoFit exercise ball to replace the blue one I purchased from Amazon a few years ago (wanted to change colors). Both balls are the same size (65 cm), however, both balls are NOT the same size when fully inflated. My current exercise ball is quite a bit larger than the GoFit ball. I should have listened to the other unfavorable reviews about this product and not purchased it. I even waited 24 hours as some other reviews recommended to give the ball a chance to expand before inflating more air to reach full capacity (65 cm). To no avail. The ball is so full and so tight, I am concerned it will pop. It certainly will not perform as it is supposed to at the current inflation size.I do NOT recommend this product because it does not perform as advertised."
4,"great ball, as described",This ball looks to be a good quality so far. I just wish I could get a white in 75cm.
1,ball exploded,I must admit- I loved using the ball to sit on --it is great for your back BUT I was sitting on it recently & it EXPLODED loudly -LEAVING PIECES AS IF THE BALL WAS CUT BY A KNIFE- - sending me head & neck-first into a nearby wall (it was like someone suddenly jerking a chair from underneath you)- which resulted in some neck & shoulder trouble /pain. I'm guessing the physical symptoms were similar to 'whiplash' from a car accident.My neck was messed up for a long while -- contacting the company (via phone) did absolutely NO good --as their rep did their best(of course) to quickly minimize the situation. (I'm sure they have been given a 'script' for this type of call). Anyone know a good lawyer for this type of case ?What is interesting = the 'new' ball I bought (same type of ball--different company) said 'constructed of ANTI-BURST material' on the package -- leading me to believe --there must be a 'history' of this problem -somewhere!-- so be careful out there !
3,"Good ball, wrong size","Agree with the reviews on here about the ball being fairly sturdy and nice. The foot pump was fine and only took a minute to blow the ball up. However, while the packaging said 65cm (what I ordered), the ball inside was only 55cm. Amazon are exchanging at no charge, but it's a hassle and I can't be sure that the replacement will be the right size, since the issue is with the supplier's product packaging."
1,Popped when filling with air,"Very disappointed; when filling this ball to the recommended size on the included insert, it popped before it even got near the recommended size."
4,bouncy ball okay,"This is just a pretty standard exersize ball. It was a little hard to inflate with the pump given. It is really hard to know when you have inflated it enough. It gives a circumfrence of a properly inflated ball, but I didn't have a tape measure long enough that would go all the way around the ball. I think I did it alright though, and I am happy with what I have done with it."
2,Worthless,Doesn't work well. For some reason transitions affect only part of a slide. The whole slide image doesn't transition. A big disappointment.
5,Great converter,"Had one, left it overseas with my neice to use a US dvd player so I could send her DVDs from here. So glad to find another as the place I got it did not have it anymore. Thank goodness for Amazon"
3,not bad...,"heaps of photos and a simple read, but would be better if the pics were in colour and larger in size. however there is so many different examples of 911's and 912's they cover in this book and era, it would be hard to photograph and describe them all."
4,The 911 & 912 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity,"As a first time Porsche owner/restorer, this book gave me excellent references for locating model year differences. I was educated and entertained while reading this book and recommend it both prior and after to buying your early model year Porsche 911 or 912. Photographs were definitive and accurate with part number nomenclature demystified."
3,"Horror?...but, in a ""funny"" way","This film is really out there. It has some pretty good effects which i wasn't really looking forward too, so, that surprised me for a low budget film. The acting is wellll...lets just say it has its moments..lol. But, the film has some great funny parts thats for sure. If your into comedy/horror than this film is a great pick up for you other than that, its a rental for sure."
1,One star is better than NONE!,"I actually purchased this video. Why I think the artwork on the box is awesome. that's about it. I like the whole mad scientist concept and some dialogue was ok. Other than that it deserves what it gets BAD reviews. For 13.99 it's not that much of a rip off. At least you can take it to the ""John"" and look at the art cover. hehe Than again if you get a kick out of ""so bad it's good"" you might sit through it ""I DID"" hehe"
2,OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a goofy, goofy, goofy movie. I thought it was terribly horrible & would love to see it featured on the recently canceled MST3k!!"
2,Boring!,"Now I like this kind of movie.....usually.The reviewer below covers most of it & the two other movies he mentioned - 'Hideous' & 'Head of the Family' - I do like, but unfortunately this one just doesn't have anything going for it.A giant eye going around, for want of a better phrase, having sex with people does sound like it could be funny....but it isn't. I hate to give a Full Moon movie only two stars beause I'm definitely a fan, but to be honest, this barely deserves one! Come on people, get a grip, this isn't even a good bad movie!"
1,"THIS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ZERO STARS, BUT...........","THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT HIS MOVIE, WAS THE 2 CUTE GUYS RUNNING AROUND IN BOXER BRIEFS..THAT WAS IT...TO SEE THEM..OK, BUT DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE OR BUY IT UNLESS YOU ARE MENTALLY DERANGED"
2,"no, try again",I don't like this book. In fact I'm going to return it. It doesn't explain things well. I recommend Princeton Review stuff. But be careful whatever you get. Ask around. Its the only way.
1,very small and lightweight,"I bought this as a gift and was very disappointed. The packaging was so poor, that it came out of the flimsy box. I had to search among other items I ordered to find it. It was not damaged, though. It is very lightweight and small, so it can't really be used as a paperweight. The only thing positive is that the image of the Jayhawk looks good."
4,Took a while but my parrot enjoys it now!,I have a 30-something Amazon who is very selective (neurotic?) as to what he/she eats. My usual supply of dry food went away and so I had to change. At first my parrot was not too interested in this food but after a month or so he/she took to it and now seems to enjoy it very well. Try it!
4,Harrison's is Always Good,"This review is dictated to me by my African Grey Parrot Ziggy. He loves Harrison's products, but he is not the scavenger people say he should be. Instead, he prefers to have his foods cut into smaller pieces for easier (gentler) chewing. I have since purchased the medium-sized product, which Ziggy eats without hesitation. His veterinarian recommended Harrison's products. Although Ziggy gets a little bit of greens and carrots, etc., and sometimes treats other than this one, he is a big fan of this product and gives it a big ""go-ahead""."
1,Honesty,"I cannot understand the kudos for this film. I found it boring. I assure you I looked at it totally. With the stars that are SO GOOD I am very surprised at the waste of talent...even Steven Geray...MY, havent seen him in years. Anyway, just one person's opinion about a film that should have been great. SORRY!!!!"
2,Not the editorial quality I expected,"I checked this book out from our library to see if it would meet my needs as an in-depth introduction and more to the neurosciences. I have a number of MIT press/Bradford books and expected quite a bit from this one. I was impressed with the breadth and range of topics and the quality of scholarship, but the incredible number of typos, particularly in the second section, left me steamed. Those poor authors who had the spelling of their names butchered in print have my sympathy. These typos include some in the diagrams, which lead to confusion. I expect a better quality of editing from a large professional university press. I bought Principles of Neuroscience (Kandel) instead. My advice would be to check out a copy of the Gazzaniga from your library and go over it to see if it is acceptable to you before you spend [...] on it."
3,Decent,"Everything came in a timely manner. I'm definitely satisfied with the quantity. My only complaint would be the strawberry flavoring...I'm curious to know if its organic or not. You kind of get a chemical aftertaste. Besides that, I have no complaints."
1,Disgusting,I absolutely can't stand this stuff. Tastes horrific. Silly me for not listening to the other reviewers... but I can't understand why some people say it tastes good?
5,Great Resource Guide For Native Plant Enthusiatists,"I purchased this book during a visit to the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford PA. I garden in PA yet many of the plants covered can be used else besides the mid atlantic region. There are some hand drawings but if you are looking for photos of plants this book does not have them. It is however a great reference and my copy is full of highlighting marks I have made and refer back to often. The first 1/3 or so of the book covers design and considerations when working with native plants and one's property. The rest of the book is filled with well organized plant charts organized by cultural preference, specific wildlife value which you don't really see in other books, bloom sequence, comments in regard to a specific plant, invasives and sources as well as selected references. There is also a helpful glossary as well as a cross reference for common/botanical names."
4,solid prog,"fans of mainstream prog will get into this album .Strong points are the crisp keybords, and outstanding drums.Highlights are Animal farm, Tide, and Catalan"
2,unstable effectiveness,"I've been using this brand this product for 1 - 2 years. Its effectiveness used to be paramount. I could feel the work it's doing to my guts on every capsule. But this new bottle I got a month ago from GNC failed to effect. I wonder if its storage / shelving condition once might've killed all the germ in it and turned it into a useless bottle of white capsules because it requires 27C and lower storage condition lifetime for effectiveness perseverance, which could easily be violated if the store had local thermo hotspot or sth.My suggestion is the bottle to have an intelligent label to indicate whether the bottle has been in a place exceeding its permitted storage condition. Would make it a much better product IMHO."
5,Renew Life = Best Life,Product does a great job of keeping my gut health in check when I allow the stresses of life run me down.
5,Great Product,"I ordered this product to try to alleviate the yeast in my body and get it under control. I did the ""white tongue"" test. I started taking Ultimate Flora Critical Care on Saturday. I'm taking it twice a day. Today is Monday and my tongue is looking pinker and the white that was on my tongue is disappearing. I believe this product works and I'm testimony to it."
5,amazon review,Amazon is one of my favorite places to order from. I always get good quality items and they come fast.
3,i need info,"I love the songs Inner Universe and Rise, but I have yet to purchase this cd. I am waiting because I have heard long versions for each. I only want to purchase this album if it has the full versions of these two songs. Hope someone can help me thanks alot."
4,A 'must' for Ghost In The Shell Fans,"This album is well worth the purchase just for ""Rise"" and ""Inner Universe"". If you're a huge fan of GITS and the pulse-pounding music from the show you're going to enjoy this CD."
4,strange,"a strange mix. i've never seen ghost in a shell, but the soundtrack is pretty good. it's all over the place, from rock to electric to opratic. it's good for when you don't know what you want to listen to. i love the last two tracks, i just wish they were longer."
4,Great Anime Music,I was more impressed with this CD than I thought I would be. Its a very good soundtrack that follows GITS: SAC's first season very well. Yoko Kanno did an excellent job arranging the music on this CD. Some of it is great to get your blood pumping. Some of my favorite songs on the CD include cameo's by Origa.
3,Hmmm...,"Well, the second half of this CD is great. From ""Inner Universe"" on. Maybe it's not quite half. ""Beauty is Within Us"" is a particularly moving track. Especially when you listen closely or read the lyrics."
5,Does not dissapoint.,"This soundtrack is a constant in my car (I have a 6-cd changer). If you don't have a certain other soundtrack the last two songs leave you wanting for their full length versions. With a mixture of fast and slow songs, it is perfect for anyone who loves a good variety."
1,"Tedious, dry read.","This is one of the most difficult texts I've studied. It limps along, feeling as though it interrupts itself. It is a tedious read, poorly organized, and featureless as the Sahara."
1,Not good,"Well, I can just say this book is NOT worth the price it sells for. Yes, as with any book you may learn a few thinks butfor the price it sells it should have been written better. I just bought it because I had to. For class."
2,Introduction to computer confusion,This book is full of terminology that isn't used in the real world. It seems the goal is to get the reader to accept the author's version of what's going on in the dynamic world of managing organizations in the computer age. There is no structure to the theories presented and there are too many unneeded terms and not enough substance. If you're trying to learn how computer systems function in the real world you'll really be confused after reading this book.
4,Good Collection,"Well produced and a good overview of her career..You get rock, folk and jazz for the most part of her career. Good album."
2,sizing problems plus scratches..,"1st off the shoes came shipped brand new with several visible scratches on each shoe, also turns out I wear size 11.5 in Pony's and not 11 (like I do with Adidas, Nikes, New Balance, Converse) so please be aware there maybe sizing differences."
2,Did not last long at all,"My daughter was unhappy with this product. It did not last very long at all...maybe a total of one month. She had to get one size larger for it to fit well. It snagged on the first time wearing it and then by the 20th time of wearing it, she had to throw it away."
1,Disappointed,This book is simplistic and lacking in depth. I expected more from an author with the academic credentials of Dr.Dudley. Looks like he took the easy way out to fulfill the publication requirements of his position.
5,Afro-Latin Explosion,"In the intersection of rival forces strength can be developed. Kidjo has a huge, soulful voice inside a petite frame (I believe she's something like 5'2"") and her voice has never sounded more assured & vigorous than here.Musically, her African roots are transplanted to the music of the Caribbean and Latin America. Her producers on this record, Steve Berlin and Alberto Salas, avoid the over-production that has plagued some of her recent work. The emphasis here is on Kidjo's magnificent voice (as it should be), supported by colorful and spirited Latin percussion and instrumentation. Fast-moving songs and excellent variety make this her best album in a decade, and quite possibly the best of her career."
5,Here's a good one...,"I thought I already knew how to give effective presentations, but Marjorie Brody's book told me I had a lot more to learn. Now I know how to better understand my audience's needs and tailor my presentations to meet them. This is really an excellent book for people in all different fields. I wish all the presenters I listen to would read it too!"
4,Great Reference Book,"I had to get this book for a business communications class that I am taking and I found it to be a good tool for public speaking. It is a great reference book to have on hand because everyday you are presenting yourself, whether it be on the job, a job interview or speaking in front of people."
3,Interesting Story...,"I had just read Shutter Island and decided I wanted more of Lehane's masterful suspense writing so I chose to order this book. It starts off with lots of action, some mystery, and it really gets the reader involved in the characters early on. However somewhere around the middle of the story the action got a little too complex. Many characters are introduced and it cause some distraction from what is happening in the story. I think if this was a SHORTER story that got more to the point it would have been more enjoyable. I appreciate the idea of leading the reader in different directions, but I found myself disinterested at some points. If you are a Lehane fan and enjoy his quick wit writing, then this is a good book, but I don't think it's his best. Shutter Island is hard to top."
3,Torn between 3 or 4 stars,"This is my first Lehane novel, although I've seen both the films Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone and thought both were well done. I blazed through this novel in only a day or so, which means it at least kept my interest going however the overall experience was less than satisfying. The authentic-sounding snappy dialog present in Gone Baby Gone seems to have been replaced in this book by superficial comments and inane chatter. The entire plot, which I thought started off ok, eventually deteriorates into a mishmash of violence and unconvincing twists and characters. The reuniting of the two detectives, both professionally and romantically, was utterly underwhelming and not very believable to me. However, I have already bought another Kenzie/Gennaro Lehane book to see if my dislike for this one was just a fluke so I liked what I read enough to give the series another try."
5,Set aside time for Prayers for Rain.....,"You will not want to put this book down till it is done. It amazes me that an author (Dennis Lehane) can take characters (Patrick, Angie Bubba) and make them interesting, fresh and exciting even after five books. You want to continue to read about these characters book after book and I think that is more difficult to accomplish than writing about different characters each time. The only problem is now having to wait a year for the next book from Lehane. Thank you for the great entertainment!Ree-views"
4,This guy is good!,"Someone told me to read them in order and I am glad I did. Excellent reading. Dennis has a way with words and characters. The dialogue is dry and great! I can hear the Boston neighborhoods! Loved all the characters and especially Bubba who is a hoot! I will have to save ""Mystic River"" for another time. It's a little too dark for me. But I hear it is great. Congrats, Dennis!"
5,Prayers for More Dennis Lehane Books...,"This book really rocks. It's perfectly paced with excellent character development. Lehane really knows how to write compelling dialogue. Reading this book is like watching a terrific crime movie where you're on the edge of your seat wondering how it's going to turn out with each turn of the page. It's a novel full of psychos, weirdos and other fascinating characters, you'll get a kick out of reading it."
2,Cartoon Characters,"Dennis Lehane has to lose Bubba, a homicidal maniac with the depth of a cartoon character. And while Lehane may know Boston, it sounds like he's never been beyond Route 128. No one in Western MA refers to Boston as 'downtown' (as the amputee at the motel does). I'm not a big fan of detective fiction, but I followed this up with Robert Parker's 'Small Vices', another detective yarn set in Boston. I found Parker's book to be superior in execution and pacing."
5,Lehane Just Gets Better & Better!,"My favorite Lehane book yet. He keeps getting better and better. Read this book in a day, hard to do with two little rugrats running around! I highly recommend this series. If you can, start in the beginning with the first book. Dennis Lehane is the best!! John Sandford look out!"
5,A new master in the genre,"When reading Lehane it is easy to forget that it is genre fiction. To loosely quote one of his jacket blurbs... ""Damn he writes beautiful sentences."" Although some might argue, I think Lehane stands next to some of the true artists of the written word simply on literary merit. All of this is not to mention that he has created some of the most compelling characters in the mystery game today. And, even better, he has brought Boston back to life as a character unto itself. Bravo -- keep it up!"
3,"Dennis Lehane just misses the mark,","""Prayers for Rain"" has all the characters Lehane has created in five previous books, but the storyline is too weak to be compelling.. But ""Gone, Baby Gone"" was so on the mark, it might be I expected the same level of pure ""hardboiled"" prose, and came away still wanting to be as dazzled. Bubba still reminds me of an unprincipled ""Hawk""(Parker's Spenser sidekick) clone without the finesse and moral certainty, and his reliance on his lack of intelligence is a weak gimmick. Patrick seems to be growing more interesting than the rest of the crew, and Angie is no longer as funny as she tries to be. Maybe it's time for Patrick to move on, fly solo and stop falling back to the same old patterns. Nevertheless, it's way too early in the series to give up on the trio, and I eagerly await the next installment. Lehane has only wobbled, he's no where near falling down."
4,"A great book, but I was let down.","Prayers has all of the successful elements of Lehane's other books: the chemistry between the characters, the plot twists, the sharp dialogue. It all works...but the end product is just not as satisfying as the other Lehane books.The mystery this time around involves a former client's apparent suicide. It troubles Kenzie because he failed to return a phone call from her shortly before her death. The circumstances of her life and the people in her life who sought to ruin it are the focus of the rest of the book.Let nothing in this review stop you from reading this book. It's great!One very important point: DON'T READ THIS BOOK BEFORE READING ""GONE, BABY, GONE."" The ""bad guy"" and several other plot points of that other book are mentioned several times in this one. You have been warned."
3,"Not Great, Not bad","My first of the Gennaro/Kenzie series, my 2nd Lehane novel. Lehane has a great reputation but after reading this and Shutter Island I have not yet been blown away. They both start off very strong but fail to deliver in the end. For ""Prayers"" I was disappointed in the direction of the 2nd half of the book. Starts off intruiging but plateaus and does not sustain the same level of suspense throughout. It was OK."
5,Trust me: Dennis Lehane is a living classic,"Maybe it's just me, but I read this book twice. Started it the second time at the same reading when I first finished it. My only regret is that I lent it to a friend and will probably never see it again. The writing has a very cool style, with spunk, good description and a wonderful, wonderful set of characters. I preferred it to my first of Lehane's - Gone Baby Gone - because GBG was just a bit grisly for my taste (still, well worth reading). My favorite character, aside from the protagonist, is Bubba. What a creation! Finally I've found another series to enjoy as much if not more than Block's Matthew Scudder."
3,"Series still good, but getting old","Prayers for Rain is the last in the Kenzie, Gennarro detective series, and it starts to show that Lehane made a good choice in changing characters for his most recent novel, Mystic River (a great book).This is the 5th in the series, and some of the dialogue between Patrick, Angie and Bubba gets old and I just skip over it because it really adds nothing to the story. Like in Darkness Take My Hand (the best in the series) Lehane does a great job of plotting and shifts the focus of the plot halfway through the book from why a woman killed herself, to who perhaps made her kill herself.Lehane is a good author and I recommend everyone of his books."
4,"Technical glitches, but a terrific novel.","Make no mistake, I LOVE Lehane's books (A Drink Before the War is stunning). He writes great detective fiction. However, as a reader wouldn't you be jarred out of your willing suspension of disbelief if an author describes his protagonist driving a car east from Baltimore to Washington, D.C. in ten minutes? (D.C. is southwest of Baltimore, and you'd never make it in ten minutes.) My point: Very basic technical issues are slipping past the editors! Bubba uses a silencer on a .22 caliber revolver - huh? Gas escapes from the gap between the chamber and the barrel, nullifying the silencer's effect. But with a .22 why bother anyway? Another: Patrick using a lead-weighted sap to try to knock someone out? That went out with running boards on autos. Would Patrick really run the high risk of killing someone by choosing such an inappropriate tool? (Dennis - Maybe a pocket stun-gun instead? $40 on eBay!) These kinds of errors detract from this otherwise fine novel."
5,Another winner,"Dennis Lehane deserves all the praise he receives. He is truly a master writer and story teller. He always delivers a well-written, strongly plotted and entertaining story. Prayers for Rain ranks up there with Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River. This book is dark, gruesome, violent and riveting. It's well paced and Lehane provides a number of twists and turns, as usual. Nothing, however, comes out of left field. Everything makes sense once investigator Patrick Kenzie and his partner Angela Gennaro answer the dangling questions. You'll race through this book."
4,A Tremendously Fun Read!,"This is my first Dennis Lehane book but it won't be my last. As a lover of crime fiction, especially Michale Connelly and James Lee Burke, I simply devoured Prayers for Rain. The dialogue is so snappy, and often so humorous, you don't realize an entire chapter has passed. It took me no time at all to get a sense of Kenzie, Bubba and Ange. These are characters you quickly get to know and care about. Kenzie has a love for the Marx Brothers, and I imagine that comes from Dennis Lehane himself, as the banter between the principals can be very funny. Despite the breezy and punchy style, there's enough darkness to satisfy the hard-boiled. And there is some effective writing here. There were several passages I made note of so that I could relay them to friends, the description and dialogue was that good. If you're going to the beach this summer, or even spending a weekend on the couch, you'll eagerly consume the zero-calorie treat that is this book."
5,A Must-Read for Mystery Fans,"I live in Dorchester/Boston where Dennis Lehane's novels take place. He has a great feel for the area, both in terms of geography and culture, which he conveys without forcing the sense of place. More importantly for a detective novel, Lehane weaves an incredibly strong mystery; he paces the revelations out perfectly right up to the very last page. And he does so in style. His prose is for the most part funny, chilling at times and at other moments painfully moving. Even more interesting for a detective series, Lehane hasn't lost focus of the main characters (Patrick, Angie and Bubba) nor has he let them grow stale. Just as he tosses a few curveballs into the investigation, he also throws major curveballs into Patrick, Angie and Bubba's personal lives. Lehane also introduces a number of new and extremely hatable villains. This is his best book since ""Darkness Take My Hand."""
3,A disappointment from Lehane,"I was expecting more from Dennis Lehane after reading the epic ""Gone Baby, Gone"", the multilayered ""Mystic River"" and the hypnotic ""Shutter Island"". ""Prayer for Rain"" is good but it is also a run of the mill piece of work. In hindsight, I can understand why Lehane hasn't reunited Kenzie and Gennaro since this thriller was published back in 1999."
5,Series Just Keeps Getting Better,"Just by happenstance I bought and read A Drink Before the War the first in this series and am I glad I did. If anything this is even better than the first. This book actually lives up to the usual hype used in cover blubs. The dialogue really does sparkle and I was happy to read that the two main characters, Kenzie and Gennaro got back together again. This is something since ahhh, they aren't real people. Their go-to sidekick Bubba remains just right, a guy that verges on a superhero and is always there for them. One minor complaint. The evil genius they battle is former Special Forces and, of course, was involved in a war crime in Panama. The author makes it appear that US Army usually just equals massacre by golly. Lehane is just so good I'll give him a bye just this once."
3,"Good book, very dark as usual. Great writing.",It is a good book but not the best Dennis Lehane. Some cliché scenes were not necessarily needed. Writing is great as usual.
5,Excellent story right through till the end,"After reading and thoroughly enjoying Gone Baby Gone I bought Prayers for Rain to see what these chracters were up to next. This book is even better. Great characters, captivating storytelling and so many interesting twists and turns that every time you think you have it figured out, you're surprised. One of the best books I've read."
3,This guy is good!,"Someone told me to read them in order and I am glad I did. Excellent reading. Dennis has a way with words and characters. The dialogue is dry and great! I can hear the Boston neighborhoods! Loved all the characters and especially Bubba who is a hoot! I will have to save ""Mystic River"" for another time. It's a little too dark for me. But I hear it is great. Congrats,Dennis!"
3,"Disappointing, especially at the end.","I'm praying that Lehane doesn't become what Robert B. Parker has become, a novel machine. Prayers for Rain is like fast food compared to the rich meals of his previous books. The story is not very involving. Unlike his previous books, we don't get a strong sense of why Patrick wants to help defend this girl's honor or get back at the forces that made her this way. Although there are some strong scenes of revenge like in previous novels, the ending seems like a tacked on afterthought, a real let down after reading the rest of the book."
2,Not Up to Lehane's Usual Standard,"After four engrossing and original novels, Lehane takes a major step backwards into triteness and cliche with ""Prayers for Rain:"" Good guys beat up bad guys. Bad guys beat up good guys. Good guys really beat up bad guys. Bad guys . . . well, you get the idea. The excessive violence is accompanied by excessive sex, with various characters going to bed with each other for no good reason. It seems that Lehane has finally succumbed to the difficulty of writing a series: he has run out of ideas, and is filling up pages with graphic content that he hopes will sell.The characters are also less interesting or even stereotypes, including an unethical psychiatrist, a dysfunctional family, and a sociopathic ruthless criminal. The latter two are all too reminiscent of previous Lehane novels.I hope that there will be a sixth Kenzie/Gennaro story. I also hope that Lehane waits until he has one of his uniquely original plots before he writes it."
5,First class,Prayers for Rain was my first Dennis Lehane book and it won't be the last. I am surprised that Lehane has not received wider acclaim. If you enjoy pyschological thrillers and the ride on which they can take you then DON'T MISS THIS ONE!
5,Lehane is a God!,"It seems that each decade has a writer who has made an impression in the PI genre...Chandler, Hammett,Leonard. The new millennium has Dennis Lehane. As an avid reader and unpublished writer, I can appreciate the work that goes into crafting a good story. Some authors are able to craft stories, but don't have that ""internal gift"" that is given to only a few fortunate writers. Dennis Lehane is one author who has truly been blessed with that gift. PRAYERS FOR RAIN comes at you like a speeding train, and never lets up. Lehane is a master at dialogue, his prose is sublime. When you find yourself caring about fictional characters, absolute in your belief that they are real, you know you're reading a book by a great writer. The Kenzie/Gennaro series should NOT be missed...I can't say enough about Dennis Lehane. My only regret is that I have to wait for his next novel...I hope the wait isn't long."
5,3rd book of the second trilogy of bone.,"bone is great! be sure to get every bone book, you don't want to miss out on the greatest comic ever made."
1,Warning!!!,"Do not buy this if you already own Psycho Messiahs, it is the same DVD. There are no interviews with the band and none of their music is even in the movie. Don't waste your money on this!! If you want a good biography read ""System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood"" by Ben Myers it's way better than this DVD and has actual quotes and interviews with all of the band members."
3,A bit disappointing....,"Unlike several of Scott's other novels, this one seems to have been written quickly and tossed into the market. The plot was thin, the characters undeveloped, the sex perfunctory. Not impressed."
3,Too expensive,"When I ordered both books, I thought they are two different books. Actually, they are alomost same. This book has same charpter titles/wording as the author's ""Complete Guide for Technical Recruiting"". It just changed some words, such as using ""bill rate"" instead of ""Fee"", the rest are almost same. I guess what I want to say is that: there is no need for you to buy this two books together because they are almost same. I think the author should include some information from this book (.. for IT Firm) to the ""Complete..."" book, makes it a liitel more ""complete"". ..."
4,reader from new york,the book is awesome and i really wants to aquire it because it will be asset to my collection
4,need some HELP!!,"Just got my Victor Mole Trap and am excited to get rid of the ""Varmits"".In reading the instructions AND others comments here,they are all GREAT by the way,I have one very important question.My yard is ""spotted"" with mounds of dirt but I don't really have any specific tunnels that I can see.Everyone's directions are to step down on the tunnels and place the trap.I see no tunnels only mounds of dirt.I have IDed several fairly large tunnel openings that open onto the grass,should I just place the trap over one of those openings.HELP!!!These moles are driving me nuts.THANX!!!!!!!"
5,Works great,"As a few of the other reviews have said, as long as you pick a good location, these traps work really well. I had a few false starts with some less defined tunnels but as soon as I picked a tunnel where the route was very clear, I caught my mole within 24 hours.A nice thing about this trap is that you don't have to dig down into the ground to place them. Just stick them into the ground where you find a well used tunnel. I bought two, but I actually think one would have been totally fine. It seems pretty sturdy too, so if we get any more moles in the future I will be ready!All in all, I would certainly recommend this product."
2,Still have moles....,"I tried several tricks to rid myself of my moles. I tried flooding them and using flares in their hole.. all with no success. I bought this trap last spring. It's now fall and I still have moles. As a matter of fact, it hasn't caught one mole yet!! I just got a couple kittens that I'm hoping will help me with the mole problem in the spring. I think my next trick will be to try those poisen worms or some people have suggested using wrigley chewing gum.... if none of those things work I may have to resort to dynamite!! If I do try another trap, it'll be one of those in-line traps...."
1,It doesn't work,I bought six. Totally ineffective. Don't waste your money. Model 0631 is the only trap that works.
2,Victor Mole Trap Plunger Style,"I purchased 2 units, but I have not yet captured a mole. It is easier to set than the scissors type. I'll have to wait 'til spring to make a final review."
3,Mole Trap,"Just recently set the mole trap. Haven't caught the critter yet, but hope to. Trap is well made and designed and should bring results."
1,Worthless,Please dont let this bad item review reflect on the seller. The trap doesnt work at all. Not worth the time to even try this item. It looks like it is a great design but it doesnt work.
3,Tricky Setup,"I read the instructions five times in order to ""set"" the traps. I still couldn't ""get-it"". So, I put the thing in my vise. I studied the trigger mechanisim and the ""light"" went on. I have not set the traps up yet because the moles seem to have disappeared after I put grub killer on the lawn."
3,"Works, but a little bit tricky","By biggest complaint about this trap is that it is not all that easy to set, and the directions are vague. Once set it works well and is easy to see even in tall grass, so you can tell from a distance if it has gone off."
2,"Not like the ""old"" Victor traps","This new trap is hard to set and doesn't have a very sensitive release. I've tried it in several runs and it has only gone off once. Most of the time I take it out of the ground and have to ""force"" it to release so I can move it and reset it. I bought two of them and have not gotten any moles in a couple months. That's a lot less efficient than my old ones that are getting pretty sloppy (tripping action) and worn out."
5,powerfull,best plunger type. more powerfull than other type. works great in sod areas. will last for many years. traped mols on first setting.
2,It's a bust,Cut my hand the first time I tried to set set it. Hard as hell to set. Cant use it when the ground is wet. I didn't like this sucker at all
3,Cost reduction strikes again,"I am known in the neighborhood as ""The Mole Man"" as I will catch moles for my friends. Recently some low-life stole my trusty old Victor mole traps right out of my neighbor's front yard. I have found the harpoon type to be the most effective trap made.I replaced them with what I thought would be identical traps. Alas, they are of the same basic design, but are made lighter and cheaper. I have doubts about them holding up like the old ones. The steel parts are lighter, and the protective zinc coating (galvanizing) questionable."
3,mole trap,"its ok, make sure you take all human scent off this trap or your wasting your time setting it, the will go around the trap"
5,One killer trap that works!,"This trap worked 1st time with-in 3 hours of setting it. Moles had my yard dug up and hilled tunnels everywhere like I've never seen in 35 years. I figured it had to be a whole colony of critters and would be trapping for months, (nope) it was one mole that caused all the dammage! I bought 4 traps but only needed 1. Would highly recommend this trap!"
1,Poor Organization,"There are no answers in the back making it hard to check my work without consulting elsewhere, such as a solutions manual. The lack of organization and overall readability of the book is low and I think that examples are of poor quality as they don't always efficiently teach the concepts."
1,A horrible attempt.,This is probably the worst textbook that I have used in the past two years. The book makes a lot of basic concepts seem very difficult and a lacks the proper examples to even explain what the problems at the end of the chapter are asking. The wording is very boring and tends to put the reader to sleep- making the poor explanation of concepts even worse. The authors jump around and often fail to define terms or use them before they are explained. The index has proved to be worthless in many of these instances. There are a lot of problems that I do not believe could be solved by a new edition.
5,I love Lawrence Welk,"Lawrence Welk and his orchestra family are icons in American history. We are all indebted to his wonderful entertainment, talent, hard work and morality that supports good family life and continues to inspire us for over 50 years on television. His autobiography and other books are very enjoyable reading and bring back many memories."
4,smaller than expected,"I suppose I didn't read the description of these very well, because I expected them to be a bit larger. In the end they were fine. I use them as cookie cutters for tiny cookies. They are great!"
5,It's a MUST-HAVE,"I carry this in my pocket at all times! It is safe, small, effective and very very handy. The first one lasted a very long time and I bought three more so I never run out."
1,Falling apart,"Like the functionality, but the watch is literally falling apart. All of the plastic around the face has stretched and separated from the watch proper, exposing the buttons which have now loosened. The company has been unresponsive."
4,Thigh high compression stockings,"The compression stockings are comfortable and provide the support needed to improve blood circulation in my legs,"
4,The Truth unmasked,"In a nutshell, this is one of many books written on this subject matter. It is a very good book, Mr Steele ocaisionally glosses over a bit of the subject matter. There is a need for much more of self examination, and this will allow us to define ourselves as Americans far better than those that have decided to race bait and perform the victim routine that seems to be so popular amongst many people of color. A couple of very wealthy black men have created a growth industry from it. We need the self examination that this book touches on, not the self hatred that some vocal minority within this minority are preaching."
1,Under the guise of promoting better race relations...,"I was terribly disappointed after reading this book...before reading, one gets the impression that the views expressed about race relations are refreshing and eye-opening, but it ended up being the same tired old arguements that we have all heard before. Steele contradicts himself repeatedly in making some extreme generalizations, and really paints a very negative picture of African-Americans. He seems to want African-Americans to take the blame for all the problems within their race in order to promote better accpetance by white America. He also encourages blacks to give up ""being black"" and to completely assimilate themselves into the white world, just as he has done. I don't understand how these views could be so well received."
5,Ralph Ellison meets Sartre,"I'm a man of the left, so for years, my only impression of Steele was is in his vilification on the left as a conservative apologist for the status quo. After hearing the man speak, I've been reading his books one by one and have to say that Steele charts his own unique path as one of the few writers to tap into the nuances of the agonized American race discourse. This is a substantial book full of rich and profound social insight that should make dogmatists from all sides and persuasions squirm."
5,texrican,"I think this book should be mandatory reading for high school students as well as college. It brings out issues that are never discussed in any news program or radio shows. If we are really serious about understanding race relations, this book is a must read. Now I understand why national liberal civil rights leaders do not support candidates that support freedom for individuals, if they did, they would not have a job."
1,a weak look at race relations,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read on race relations in the United States. Steele's arguments are illogical and he is prone to making sweeping generalizations. He takes his own personal experiences and instead of comparing them to some statistical evidence or academic theories, he universalizes them and presents them as 'facts'. Steele's claim that he can walk into a lecture hall on the first day of class and look at each of his Black students and be sure that they will finish in the bottom half of the class is offensive. The rest of his claims deserve nothing more than a snicker. However, as a white women who is well read in African-American studies, I can tell you that if you are white and looking for a book that will illuminate your understanding of what it is like to be Black in the United States, please choose another book and another author."
5,A luscious thriller,"Jill Fitzpatrick is a private investigator hired to find a missing student. When the girl is found murdered, Jill promises the girl's parents that she'll find who did it. The girl's former poetry professor, Diana, weaves an intoxicating spell of seduction that overwhelms Jill. Is Diana just a simple, thoroughly enjoyable distraction to Jill's mission, or is there something darker hiding behind the woman? After another professor is killed, Jill finds that she herself might be next. Porter's saucy thriller, told through a series of poems, electrifies the senses and rockets the reader to its shocking end. Not only is it a spectacular mystery, but it's also a taut, dazzling story of obsessive, flooding desire."
3,Hail the Narrative Poet!,"In times when most readers wouldn't be cought dead buying a book of poetry, Dorothy Porter has proven the impossible by writing a book of poems that has become as popular as your avarage crime novel. While her story is nothing exceptional, she has carried out the incredible task of inroducing contemporary poetry to a generation of readers who can't tell Shakespeare from Ginsberg. She might have just opened the door for all the other poets who are tired of being ignored in favour of prose writers."
4,Pretend and Play,Product was exactly what I expected. It arrived on time and in great condition. I was happy with this purchase and my daugther is looking forward to playing with her new school supplies.
2,not much in the package,"I thought these cards would have a plastic coating on them so they could be written on multiple times. They are just paper! They are kind of small. For the price, I could have just gone to the dollar store! That's what I'll do next time!"
4,Pretend teaching,"I actually purchased this for my 4 & 5 year-old granddaughters; however, when my 9 year-old grandson saw it, he immediately went into the teacher mode and the 2 girls fell right in line playing the parts of students. Very cute"
4,Good for playing school,"I enjoy this toy for my daughter. She likes playing with the maps and learning the different states. My biggest complaint about this toy is that the refills for the activities are the same as the ones it came with. I wish they would change the lessons to make it different each time. Also, our clock ""tower"" broke a little the first couple times she used it and we had to tape it. Other than those couple things, my daughter enjoys it!"
4,school teacher play,"Great idea for pretend teacher play. I thought that the cards would be a little bigger,and that it would be more durable. Overall not bad though."
4,Decent reeds for a decent price,"Normally I use Vandoren reeds, but these are a great substitute for daily practicing (since they are about half the price). Of course, you get what you pay for, but they are a great value for the cost. I'd recommend them any day for players at any level.Ordering from Amazon is easy and convenient."
3,Not a favorite,"We are big Dr. Seuss fans around here but this is our very least favorite. It is not as clever as most and I find some of the text kind of bizarre and puzzling (such as a clam complaining that she cannot eat huckleberry jam because she has no teeth...umm I think you can eat jam without teeth).But most of all, the illustrations in this book are just horrid. Cheesy. Ugly. Garish. They kind of make me feel weird. I don't mind so much that they don't resemble a typical Dr. Seuss-illustrated book. But whoever illustrated this took it too far with the big toothy grins and what not. I can't stand looking at it!!"
5,Great Book,My 3-year-old loves this book! It gives the youngsters the idea of baby teeth and permentent teeth. The pictures are cute and the text are fun too. My son giggles every time we read it to him.
2,Not as Good as Seuss's Own Illustrated Works,"This book is a brief and playful introduction to the different kinds of teeth that are found in the world -- reminiscent of The Foot Book but not as good. The text is by Dr. Seuss and illustrations by Joe Mathieu; while children might enjoy it, it's not nearly in the leage of some of Seuss's best work, although it does include wordplay and the wonderful rhythmic text he is known for. It is disconcerting to hear Seussical rhyme with illustrations that are so different from his, and the effect is a little incoherent -- not quite hitting the mark."
2,Not the best...,"We love The Eye Book and The Ear Book, but this one is not the same quality of writing (in my opinion). It's okay, but I think there are better books out there that cover the topic of teeth."
2,The tooth book,The book I received was an older edition with different illustrations than shown on the book on Amazon. The older illustrations are done by Roy MkKie and are not as appealing as the newer edition illustrated by Joe Mathieu.I was disappointed to receive a different version than what was advertised by the picture.
5,Fun Book for any child,"My son loves all the Dr. Seus books, great for any child who is first learning to read."
5,GOTTA LOVE DR. SEUSS,I have a five year old and the Dr. Seuss books are perfect for him to learn to read with...plus they are silly and fun
3,"Cute, but not my favorite Dr Suess Book","I got this for my 9 month old thinking it would be appropriate since she was starting to get her teeth. It's a cute book, but not my favorite or hers. It has a lot of concepts in it she just won't get for many years to come (loosing teeth etc..) but I'm still glad it's part of our library. The board book is just perfect for her little hands."
1,Sorry Disappointed,"My brother, a dentist, bought this for my son for a Christmas. I, being a bit of a Seuss-nut, would never have boughten it as it was never published during Seuss's lifetime. I can see why. It has no smooth rhyming patterns making it difficult to read with a rhythm. The pictures are not drawn by Seuss, either. The purpose of the book is good but there are plenty of other children-dentist books out there to choose from."
4,race and ethnicity,"Race and Ethnicity was a great learning tool to any mulitculture class, it helped give insight to America's race relations."
3,Decent book that identifies race and ethnic issues,"This book was used as text for an Intro to Ethnic Studies class. It provides a lot of good information, and hits on many aspects of the social issues and complexities of race and ethnicity. It reads surprisingly easy, and as long as you're not one of those ""I don't see race, it doesn't exist anymore!"" fools who thinks ignoring issues is a valid way to address them, you will have no problem understanding the concise supported information laid out. My only issue is that there is a Graph in the beginning of the text (I think it's on the front cover aswell) that projects that Indigenous people of America will be extinct in the near future. I understand they are using this graph to illustrate the limited population that Native communities have around the country but they are strong and resourceful as any people on the planet, and are (especially within the last 15 years) providing means to support their communities."
4,Dover strikes again,"As always, Dover has produced a clean, relatively easy to read score of one of music literature's masterpieces. The English translations are good, and the layout is quite readable. As a study score, or perhaps for use in performance, this edition is highly recommeded."
1,Oh lordie!!,"""I've spent my whole professional career looking for this..."" and the person who says this has to be all of 24 or 25 years old. Is this about a bad guy (Jack Scalia) or about a killer squid? Well, the plots are intertwined, but they really make no sense. We could have had two movies here. One about the search for treasure and the other about a guy trying to find the squid that killed his parents. This film had elements from ""Tentacles"", ""Thunderball"" and ""Into the Blue"". The acting was weak, the script was silly and the creature was from a special effects guy who is probably currently pursuing a different career path now. The ending was great. ""Nobody's going to believe us"" Well, they got that one right. I saw it and I don't believe is. The bottom line here is that if you see this one in the video store, keep looking. You can do better."
2,Squid Pro Quo...,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, so it was no big surprise that it had the distinct aroma of months old, sun-baked chum. KRAKEN: TENTACLES OF THE DEEP is the tale of a young man's quest to avenge the deaths of his parents (yep, they were kraken chow). It's also about some treasure-hunters and a gang of ne'er-do-wells (dressed in black of course) out to steal the sunken treasure. Oh yeah, there's a giant cgi squiddy in the mix as well. This Many-armed mess is almost as realistic as MR. LIMPET, and nearly as terrifying! In order to relive the horror of this movie, simply wrap your head in wet, well-cooked spaghetti while your cranium is submerged in the toilet. Flush. Repeat..."
1,To many Times,"This Story has been done Way To many Times. The Beast, Creature, Octopuss and countless others have the same theme. Group goes searching for Evidence of giant squad or To Kill it and they get stuck at sea and must fend of the onslaught of tenticals. I have seen it all before."
2,Sci fi channel movie,"Okay I rented this,This is your typical sci fi movie its a bomb!Personally the best part was victoria pratt in a bikini other then that phew!"
2,NEW SQUID ON THE BLOCK,"Bless the Sci-Fi channel...without them, we wouldn't get our cheesy film fix, like in this low-budget howler. The squid's special effects are pretty amateurish and some of the dialogue, especially from villain Jack Scalia, is pretty bad. You might find it mildly entertaining, but poor Charlie O'Connell, not seen too much since his time on his brother Jerry's SLIDERS and Victoria Pratt will never live this one down. Not totally bad, but not far from it."
2,"OK for light use, but be careful with the dishwasher","This was a disappointment to me. I was hoping that it would be similar to NordicWare, but the bowl and cover on this unit is just light plastic. There are multiple and somewhat inconsistent warnings not to use oils or butter without food in the bowl, and not to put the bowl in the bottom of the dishwasher. I'm not optimistic that it will last very long, but we'll try to be very careful with it. I won't be buying any more Progressive International microwave cookware."
5,I LIKE CORN !!!!!,"Tried this Corn Steamer out last night. Directions for frozen cobs was for 8-12 mins. Cooked mine for 8 mins. Good and very HOT !!!!! lol But perhaps a little bit too cooked for me tho. Next time will use 6-7 mins. Love corn,,,,, GREAT PRODUCT. Good buy :)"
4,Steams well,* he below review is given by my wife *This corn steamer is very convenient and easy to use. It steams the corn kernels very swiftly in microwave. The shape of the steamer is well made to keep the corn cob easily into it. Good Product.
3,should be better,It is difficult to get the top off aftermicrowaving. I have another that has aplace to pick up the top.
3,Cautious rating for now!,This looks ok but haven't had the chance to use it extensively like I'd like to before giving a rating! To be fair ill be neutral for now. By Christmas it'll have much more use and I suspect a better rating.Will change it after longer use. Initial impression acceptable.
3,Miracle Corn Cob Steamer,This steamer is very light weight and cheap. I doesn't fully close to keep in the steam for larger ears of corn. I found a good one in Florida and totally discontinued using a microwave. DAH???? DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.
2,Aghhh!,"I am a huge fan of horror. I remember watching the old Night Gallery series on TV. Maybe it's just these 6 particular stories I didn't like nor get, particulary the Stop Killing Me story."
1,cancer causing train,"I just bought this train set for my son, he had wanted it for over 6 months. It has a warning label on it saying it causes cancer. I was in shock. All the recalled Thomas trains were suppose to be taken off the shelves. I am reporting this to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I am returning it and contacting Target and Bachman. I don't want anyone to make the same mistake I did. It is illegal to continue selling these products. The warning label on it is so small I didn't see it until after we were already playing with it and I was about to throw away the box. This is an urgent matter and a critical issue."
4,More than imagine...,"Being a fan of Sam Trammell, I purchased this film not knowing what to expect. I enjoyed it so much, I bought copies for 3 of my friends. The concept does seem cheesy, but the acting is so good, and the script so well-written that we are all inside the jokes. Daniel Baldwin and Sam have a great on-screen chemistry, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film and its conceits.It's also worth noting that the movie is mostly family-friendly, and my 10 year old daughter, Josie, loved it as well."
3,Burned out fast on this program. Careful...,"I tried the Mentzer sytem for 8 weeks. Initially I made impressive gains, especially in strength. And it was great to get in and out of the gym quickly. But alas, I was burned out at the end of the 8 weeks and lost the lines that I had worked for. I would recommend this system only as break from regular training, not as a substitute. And you can't bring out the striations and lines on only a few sets and limited exercises unless you are a genetic freak and on the juice like Mike was.Sorry to hear about Mike's passing. He was a true icon for sure. Perhaps, and I say this respectfully, his passing is a message for the rest of us. Stay away from the juice and follow a more sensible, healthy training program.Use this with caution, if you use it at all."
2,"I wonder, Mr. Mentzer, did you get a proofreader?","I just bought the High Intensity Cassette Program, and although I haven't tried it yet, (I'm in the three week resting phase before the program begins) I must say that the organization of the program is poor. There is no mention of abdominals, and he doesn't have an illustration of the exercises, so one doesn't know how to go about doing the ""Pec Dec"" exercises for example, and he mentions no alternative exercise program for those who may want a variety every 2-3 months. He also mentions nothing about aerobics, other than not do it. Additionally, he mentions nothing about any advanced program for those who may be on this program for a year or more. It just seems like he never gave this program to anyone else to edit at all, it's as if he turned in the rough draft as the final draft. As for effectiveness of the program itself, I'm not sure about that, I'm still in the process of trying it out, but honestly I seriously doubt it will work...but it may."
2,Pop Fiction,Number of world record holding powerlifters and olympic weightlifters who used his methods to win = 0Number of world record holding track and field athletes that have used his methods to win = 0These methods develop ABFU (architecturally beautiful functionally useless) muscles.Sounds great in theory but there is little science behind it.
5,refreshing and objective insight into muscle building,Mike Mentzer's insight is a god-send to anyone wishing to actualize their bodybuilding potential. This book is a must-read for anyone who is serious about building muscle. Mentzer is objective and honest in his approach to bodybuilding!
5,SENSIBLE TRAINING ADVICE : FIRST-RATE RESULTS!,"Here is program of training that makes sense. It accords with the principles of obtaining muscular hypertrophy and strength. Each and every workout session brings increases in strength gains. Muscular gains come along with these strength gains, but at a slower rate, which is to be expected. Mike Mentzer is to be congratulated for his work, and this latest program is his best yet. Congratulations, Mike Mentzer!"
1,"Why God, Why?","Mr. Mentzer is your typical, no-brain musclehead trying to be a philosopher and fitness guru. Of the 200 minutes of tape, only 10 minutes are actually spent on training and routines. The rest is filled with jumbled-up jargon and a sad attempt by Mr. Mentzer to use as many new vocabulary words as possible. An actual quote from the tapes: ""One must not be confused by the antithesis of oceanic proliferation."" Yeah! Mike got a dictionary for his birthday. The tapes sound like Mr. Mentzer is reading VCR instructions. There is no sum and no substance."
1,UNBELIEVABLE!,"I have bought the tape programs and used them. Do they work? Yes, HOWEVER, the programs are dangerous! And I cannot believe a DOCTOR of all people advocating the use of the program. (I wonder if he was an M.D.) In additon, the program is poorly written. Before you buy this program I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BEYOND BRAWN by Stuart McRobert. Check him out before or even if you buy this dangerous routine. Otherwise you may have joint problems in the future."
4,Fun with size comparisons,This is fast-moving book that draws you along as you wonder what size comparison lies on the next page. The comparisons deal with many things...not just whales!
5,Must have guide for the Virgin Islands.,"This and Frommer's guides always make up the bulk of my reseach before a production. In this case, I shot 2 weeks in the US and British Virgin Islands, relying mainly on these books. They offset each others weekness and/or gaps. Also, their contradicitons in beach or housing ratings are interesting. The maps are good including Ferry company names so you can look up the travel times and dates on the internet. (Just avoid Speedy's old Ferrys, one blew its engine and almost sank on me going to Virgin Gorda. We were rescued just in time.) I shot ""The Best Virgin Island Beaches"" DVD here on Amazon.com. So, after you read about these places, and you really want to see, hear and feel them, check our our DVDs."
1,Sent an inferior brand that is used and crumbly,Bought for fulfillment by amazon and received not the product listed but an inferior brand that was crumbly and looked used. Look elsewhere for a good stone.
4,Uniform Bubbles,Great airstone that produces even bubbles throughout. Even under 2 inches of thick or fine gravel the stone works great.
1,Complete Junk!,"I am on my third one of these. Amazon was kind enough to replace the first two. They finally gave up and refunded my money. Amazon was very good in how they handled this at each stage. They even paid to overnight UPS ship one of the replacements, even though the cost of the item was far less and didn't warrant it. That said the stone itself is junk. Each time it broke apart and disintegrated into gravel in my tank."
1,PRODUCT NOT AS DESCRIBED,THE AIR-STONES ARE CHEAPER AND very DIFFERENT than the description AND WERE CRACKED and CLOGGED WHEN THEY ARRIVED. I am disappointed and will not be purchasing them here again.
3,Too Bad it Wasn't Better,"Given the dirth of recorded video performances by Jeff Buckley, this DVD is required material for any of his fans. The sound and video quality are quite good. Unfortunately, the performance isn't. The band's limited range and Jeff's dour mood the night of this performance ultimately left me bored. There are wonderful moments, however, and the video again reminds us what a tragedy Jeff's death was at such an early age - he could have been a contender."
4,"You heard him, now see him!","Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley, live and in person. Sadly, he lost his life in a swimming accident, and the world will be diminished, musically, by this tragedy. However, some of his finest work is captured here. This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating, and his voice is haunting. Give yourself a musical treat, and pick this DVD up. The only reason I gave it 4, instead of 5 stars, is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine. The program stalls in this song. I checked on more than one DVD player, and they both manifested the same pause. Other than that... a great buy!"
5,It's Never Over...,"I have been waiting anxiously for this DVD to come out for a very long time, and was not let down by it at all. From the amazing full concert footage, to the haunting Grace Electronic Press Kit, this DVD is a must have for all Buckley fans. We get to see a glimpse of Jeff in an intimate club setting and it's really nice to have captured that moment and to be able to go back to it, and be amazed over and over. It is truly a sad and beautiful thing all at once. I urge all music lovers to give Jeff Buckley a listen, and try not to be impressed. The only thing that I would have also included, would have been all of Jeff's videos. Other than that, this is perfect. Thanks Mary, for leaving the light on."
2,Be honest,"Buckley wrote some great songs and he was a talented singer. And his vocal solos were off-key all over the place in this performance.If you're more of a Buckley fan than a music fan (and if you call him ""Jeff"" like you knew him, you are), then you're going to buy this if you haven't already, regardless of what I say. But if you're a music fan interested in the hype, avoid this and go listen to some tracks from Grace. If you're interested, then buy it. If you fall in love, great, start picking up DVDs. But don't start here.There's a wonderful documentary called Amazing Grace (http://www.amazinggracejeffbuckley.com/) that's been making the film festival circuit. It's made by fellow Buckley worshippers, but for that very reason it paints a wonderful picture of the man's music (although it had dissapointingly little to say about the man himself). It's not available on DVD yet, but catch it if it comes through your town."
2,Lacking in quality,"Buckley's cool, and so is this concert. However, the audio is just terrible on this dvd. I watched it first on a small tv and just thought it was a problem with the speakers in the tv. Then I watched it on a really good audio system and realized that there was a problem with this DVD. The bonus tracks are fine, but the live concert audio is disappointing to say the least."
5,"Good Book, Bad Amazon","The book is excellent. All the books for the 3.5 Dragonlance setting are excellent. That being said do not order this from amazon. I ordered this book and after they changed the shipping date 3 times I cancelled my order. The final shipping estamte was 4 months after the original order. The estimate on the page says 1-4 weeks, which is not correct. I called and got the usual run around ""We don't have the book in our warehouse currently, but we should be getting shipment real soon."" In my humble opinion you should not sell books you don't have."
3,Not the best of materials available.,"Has a tendency to be long and boring at times, so for me it didn't work. I'd prefer other makers of that part of our history."
3,Could be better,"The aim of this book is admirable, but it promises more than it delivers. Although I do believe that chapters on preparation, airport transfers, french food, etc. are of value, I was disappointed that in a 276 page book, only about 100 pages are actually devoted to specific destinations within Paris. The information offered is good, I just wish that there was more."
5,"Lafuma RSX Padded Recliner, Marine","Lafuma RSX Padded ReclinerThis chair is amazingly comfortable. My wife had a back operation and during her recovery, in her words, it was ""the most wonderful thing ever."" It is well built and sturdy. It was her preferred place to sleep for several months afterward.We bought two. Used them on vacation. Everybody wanted to steal some time on them."
3,Specs are not as advertized,"This item is supposed to be 23"" long with an 18"" useable length. However it is actually 21"" long with a 14"" useable length.At first I thought I was sent the wrong item, but the plastic label encasing the spline end confirms it is indeed the HC4032 3/4"", with a diagram showing the true overall length to be 21"" and the useable working end 14"".If you want to be sure you're getting what's advertized I recommend calling Bosch customer service to confirm the actual dimensions."
4,TRUE BUT SAD!!!!!!,"This book was, to me, really two stories in one. One was about Samuel Pietro and the people who kidnapped him and the other was the main story of Amanda McCready and the people who kidnapped her. There are many twist and turns. I thought I had it all figured out, them wham, we went off in another direction. I was really liking Poole and Broussard at first, then they ending up being pond scum. Amanda is kidnapped, a ransom demanding stolen money is received. Drug dealers are killed, the stolen money is stolen again, one of the drug dealers may have been an undercover agent, the girl is still missing. I did not like the ending at all. My heart went out to the little girl, which was one ending, my heart went out to Angela which was the other ending. All in all another good mystery about Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. This is the fourth book, I would suggest reading them in order. But, I would suggest reading them. They have all been prety good."
2,Child abduction,"I can't finish reading this book. The characters are so unlikeable that I can't read on to its miserable? end. I enjoyed the author's writing ability, having admired his story Mystic River, which was brilliant, but all together depressing, but can't get into a story in which I so thoroughly dislike the mother and her TV addicted friend. Losing empathy with the characters make the outcome uninteresting and not worth its pursuit."
2,Long Gone!,This was my first LeHane novel as many people had recommended him. I didn't like the main characters Kenzie and Gennaro. Kenzie seemed like too much of a follower (although he was tough with a gun--sarcasm) and Gennero wasn't a likeable love interest. This book did manage to pick up 3/4 into it but by then it was too late.
5,Very fast read,I wanted to read this because I had read another review. Lehane has just enough twists that makes this one entertaining and easy read. So much so that I am reading the series.
4,"Another great book, yet predictable","Lehane follows up the boring ""Sacred"" with a thrilling, haunting novel about child abductions and the fine line between right and wrong.This novel was just as good as Darkness, take my hand. It had plenty of twists and turns and violence. But I was frustrated because after reading the synopsis on the jacket of the hardcover, and the 3-page prologue about someone in Port Mesa, Texas, I guessed the plot.I usually don't try and guess plots, but this one just came to me. Only so many things can happen to kids when they are kidnapped. Lehane telegraphs his plot in an obvious manner. Skip the first three pages and you'll probably not guess the plot. Still, I enjoyed this novel. Lehane is a great writer and obviously invests a lot of effort into his entertaining novels.Prayers for Rain is next on my list."
3,Gone Baby Gone,Darker than I am use to his novels being or it could be the subject matter ??? Not sure. The ending ....ended the only way it could to be believable but I was disappointed. His next novel Midnight Mile makes up for and smoothes the ruff edges of Gone Baby Gone.
5,Another great Dennis Lehane Novel,I only recently discovered Dennis Lehane and now I am addicted. I can't wait to finish this book so that I can read the sequel.
5,Great read!,"This was the first book I've read by Dennis Lehane(convinced to give him a try by other customer reviews) and it was great! Not cutesy, gritty, tightly well-written, hated to have to put it down to continue my life. He joins my favorites list which includes Michael Connelly and Robert Crais. I'm now on a search for the rest of Lehane's books and can't wait to read them all, but maybe not Sacred right away since these reviews seem to count it as not-as-good as the rest of his works. Keep up the good work, Dennis!"
4,Recommendation: Highly Recommended,"I thoroughly recommedend all of Dennis Lehane's books. Gifted author, Although, with this book, the ending was a little upsetting to me, but I guess that's what makes him a great writer. This is a must read."
4,Gritty private eye fiction,"This was a gritty, gripping, and ultimately very complicated book. I enjoyed the ride. I would suggest Dennis Lehane to readers of Robert B. Parker's Spenser series. I love Spenser a little bit more than Kenzie and Gennaro, but overall this was a great read."
4,another winner...,"Dennis Lehane has another winner in Gone, Baby, Gone. The plot has more than enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing, the characters are fully developed and (for the most part!) realistic (sorry, Dennis- Bubba isn't realistic), and Lehane's depiction of the greater Boston area rings largely true. A solid work..."
5,Simply incredible,Dennis Lehane has written four exceptional books. Gone Baby Gone continues the tradtion of each book getting incrementally better. I literally could read each book monthly because they are so outstanding. Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro are two of the most original characters in modern mystery fiction. Gone Baby Gone continues Lehane's examination of the shades of grey that we face in our society. You will not be disappointed with Lehane's books!
5,Could he get any better? He did!,"I am a big fan of Dennis Lehane. His protago- nists, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Genarro have had a most interesting relationship in the first three books. Also, the plot lines have been incredibly captivating. How could Lehane tell a better story? Well, he did. I kind of ho-hummed at the beginning of the book with the kidnapping of a 4 year old girl. But after about the first 50 pages the ho-humming stopped. This was a 2 day engrossing read. The plot twists and all the tears I shed have put this on my list of favorite books. Lehane is a master of character, plot, and motive. I honestly couldn't see where this book was going. Can't wait to see what happens to Patrick and Angie in the next one."
2,Not great,"After reading the first couple of chapters of this book, I lost interest, too wordy. Took too long to get to the missing girl. Too descriptive in many pages, gets boring. The very end of the book picked up when we learn where the child is. If it wasn't so descriptive maybe it would have been a faster read. Maybe too many characters."
2,movie better,im a fan of dennis but i`d have to say that the movie -of the same name- with casey affleck and morgan freeman is in my opinion fascinating and better. although i didn`t enjoy the novel the movie is great. if you want to read one of dennis lehane`s good novels read mystic river.
3,"Somewhat engaging, but so off base - SPOILERS","It took me 3 tries over 3 years before I could get past the third chapter, but I finally was bored enough to do it, and I can't wait to trade it in at the used bookstore for something better. This book leaves the reader with a twisted message--it's sort of okay as long as you are a cop and say that you are saving children. Just a few pages after meeting Detectives Broussard and Poole, it's easy to figure out that they are a part of the conspiracy, so I stuck with the book to figure out how, only to be ticked off in the end that Angie views Broussard as a martyr, even though it's clear he's a sadistic murderer and kidnapper with a smooth line. It would help if Lehane would research small details such as what Woolite is and that you can't just take a family hike up Mt. Rainier. If this is really Lehane's best work, I'll leave his other books alone."
3,I gulped it down but could not munch it,"This page turner about a child abduction offers a very intrincate plot and a sucession of facts and actions at very high speed. Mistery grows like an snowball, many puzzles are solved but the same question lingers all the time ...""ok.,..but where is Amanda ...?"". the story shows a true crime side with violent and bloody situations and a human side when invites the reader to debate what is the best for the future of a child. Even though I found the plot very gripping, Lehane is not my favorite author in terms of narrative and descriptive skills, his writing looks sometimes sketchy and some events seem forced."
3,Why am I so dense?,"I practically read as a profession. Although I hate to analyze--because I am not too good at it--I usually can figure things out.. But I am frustrated--actually close to angry--that the first and last scenes do not tie in, in my mind. I feel tricked. I spent time trying to imagine who the people were, how they fit into the story, and if they did, then I totally missed it. Why were they a part of this book? This is my first Lehane, and admittedly I began in the middle as others have said not to do.. does this fit into another previous book? The reviewer who said that some descriptions were wooden and others beautiful spoke my feelings as well. Still, I will look for the series."
5,A tough book to read (but worth it),"Notwithstanding ""Darkness Take My Hand,"" this is the toughest of Lehane's books to read. This may be a personal bias on my part, but I always have difficulty with crimes against children. Luckily, however, Lehane foregoes giving us any gratuitous violent scenes involving the missing children (only one of which is a major off-stage character). I found the ending as difficult to take as Angie did. I certainly understood it; legally, there was no other choice. But I didn't like it. It was odd to find myself on the side of the ""bad guys.""I was quite disappointed by ""Sacred,"" and must admit I approached ""Gone, Baby, Gone"" with apprehension. I needn't have worried. No attempts at cuteness in this dark, engrossing novel. Highly recommended."
5,Perhaps The Best Lehane Yet!,"I had fairly low expectations approaching this book. Don't get me wrong, I have loved the Patrick Kenzie series, especially ""Darkness."" But I thought ""Sacred"" was poor, so it seemed as if the series was on a downward spiral. I'm happy to report I couldn't have been more wrong!""Gone"" has all the best of Lehane: violence, grit, talk-tough dialogue and snappy banter (but not too snappy, as was the case in ""Sacred."") The book is very dark, and the subject matter of disappearing children is not pleasant. Lehane never chickens out, he delivers the real, sometimes inhumane cruel world to many pages. And there are two long scenes, back-to-back, that are among the most exciting and intense Lehane has ever written.If you like mysteries or crime fiction with an edge, or modern noir without the posing, Lehane is your man. Start with ""Prayers For Rain"" and work your way up to this book - you will be rewarded!"
5,Real Life,"I have read other books by Lehane, but I think that this may be the best so far. I am very anxious to see the movie version to see how the mother is portrayed. In the book, I thought she was a monster. I liked the way the detectives are struggling with the ""law"" and what may be ""morally"" right. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of Boston. The author made me feel as if I had taken a trip there. I had a difficult time putting the book down."
4,"A Powerful, Dark, Hard-Boiled Mystery","Dennis Lehane and Clint Eastwood have something in common. They are the masters of stories that grip you and keep you turning the pages, but finally depress you about the state of the world and its unanswerable dilemmas.Gone, Baby, Gone fits right into this category. The book has a deep and twisting plot that keeps you guessing to the very end. Lehane is great a depressing you and then relieving the pressure in smooth alternation.The characters are well drawn and interesting. The righting is tight and smooth, and the plotting is excellent.This book is NOT for the faint-of-heart (or stomach) or young. I would not recommend it to a young teenager and certainly not to a pre-teen."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR: THIS IS A MUTILATED FILM,"""His Girl Friday"" was made in 1940. Widescreen technology wasn't developed until 1953. So how is this a widescreen film? Simple: the top and bottom of the original 1.37:1 print have been trimmed off. You are not gettting more of the original picture here; you are getting less. It's foolish to buy this butchered version in the hope of getting something better than the original. This thing is a rip-off, plain and simple."
3,I have seen better...,I now own all of the Blueprint printed books. This one is not my favorite. I would assume with al of the tools available to the average person they would have covered more basic security. The book covers a few of your everyday security issues but then jumps into securing the E15k and E10k environment. The E10k section makes up most of the book like they needed content or something.Alex also covers way to much on Jumpstart.They do however cover the Sunshield BSM which allows you to audit your systems at a C2 level.Overall the book is not terrible it is a good read. Its not a all encompassing security book though.
3,good for a collection,"if you are building a CD vault, this would be essential. but realistically, only 4 good songs on here, and two made the i-pod... for the mix."
2,It doesn't work for everyone,"Perhaps you should buy a smaller bottle first and see how it works on your tummy. PB 8 helped with some symptoms I was having, however, it caused incredibly painful bloating and gas. These new symptoms only got worse when I stepped up to the full serving size recommended. (I started by taking one a day and easing into it). The new bloating and gas was so bad I would take tylenol pm just to make it through the night. Through using a food diary and process of elimination, I found out that this product was the culprit. I wish it had worked!"
3,It was good at the time,"I used to buy this probiotic before I started on Ultimate Flora, which is what I take now. The reason I switched is because they changed the formula to include dextrin/dextrose, which I can't have. But at the time, it was a good product; and for those who don't have the sensitivity to sugars, I think it would work well."
1,"PB8, not so great....for me.","I just took PB8 for two days and this morning, I had horrible diarrhea. I normally take the Kroger version of Align, which has been fantastic for me. It's time-released and has four friendly bacteria. I thought, wrongly apparently, that I could benefit from something stronger.....NO. I figured, wrongly, that stronger meant better. So many great reviews here. For me at least, this has proven to be a bad move.I'm taking the PB8 back to the store. Anything to do with chicory root (which is the inulin in it) doesn't sit well with me, but I neglected to see that on the label. That has to be the problem. Or maybe it's the L. Casei.Back to my normal, boring probiotic. :)Not everything works for everyone. Gut flora can be pretty finicky. Now I know....boy, do I know."
5,Very effective!,"I found this specific product when told by my doc that anyone over the age of 50 should be taking an Acidphilus product each day. I went to a health food store, and the sales girl said this item was the best...I bought it on her recommendation and have now taken it for over two years....religiously. I'd been having somewhat serious gastro issues, and take 2 a day and I know it's helped. I haven't tried another product because I'm so pleased with this one. In my local store, this is $24.00 for the same size bottle. After finding it on AMAZON, I now have bought it online for about 6 months. The only thing that I do differently now is I need to plan ahead, and order at least 1 1/2 weeks prior to being out. I don't want to be forced to spend the $24.00 if I don't have to. I've told 4-5 of my friends about this and they all have started taking it and are all pleased. Try it!"
4,Good stuff at a great price,"Following surgery to reposition my stomach and intestines back into my abdominal cavity, I was experiencing digestive difficulties. My doctor recommended PB8 to help the recovery process. He said Amazon had the best pricing and he was correct! I ordered online and it was shipped right away. My order was received within five days."
1,"PB 8 Pro-Biotic Vegetarian inflamed my IBS...!- Has ""Hidden"" Inulin, AKA FOS!","NOW GR8 brand pro-biotic agreed with me with me until I came down with IBS/lactose intolerance/yeast infection, after taking antibiotics.GR8 then caused BAD gas, and diarrhea!- It's prebiotic FOS/Inulin/dairy, inflamed my IBS...!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PB 8-I then tried PB 8 Probiotic for Life Vegetarian caps?-No FOS or Inulin was listed on the label, but it Also gave me BAD gas & diarrhea!?-After looking up ingredients on the mfg website, it ""Does"" have Hidden Inulin/FOS (not on label)! Grrr!Solution!- I finally found an Excellent triple Enteric coated (100% to intestine) once-a-day probiotic, that cured my symptoms first day (best taken for me in late afternoon on empty stomach)! :o)Enzymatic Therapy Pearls IC Intensive Care Probiotics, Capsules 90 ea"
2,Review of PB-8 vegetarian caps,"PB-8 vcaps is an excellent Pro-biotic product made by an excellent company but why they make and sell a vegetarian product that gives off a taste just like a strong chemical once in the mouth, I can not imagine. If I had no alternative, I would have to close my nose and just go on my longtime faith in the company, Nutrition Now."
5,Best that I have tried,"After trying several more expensive probiotics, I have seen the best results with PB 8. Saying that my IBS is better after using this product is an understatement. I'm cured! I usually take 2 capsules each morning, and sometimes another 2 after dinner. It's great that they do not require refrigeration as some other brands do."
3,Dairy sensitive/allergic beware!,"This product is highly effective - I felt better within hours of taking it. BUT despite its ""Dairy-free"" labeling it is not safe for anyone who is dairy allergic or sensitive. After a few more hours the reaction started - hives, racing heart, burning skin sensation. I did some googling and found others who were in the same boat with me. Apparently the ""proprietary process"" to remove the dairy proteins after culturing the bacteria is not so effective. I contacted the company a week ago and so far no response. Thank goodness my dairy reactions are more annoying than life-threatening!"
2,Mediocre,"I've used many probiotics and switch every 4 to 6 months per my naturopath's instructions. This one didn't work at all for me. Every person's gut flora is different and have different responses to the various blends out there.I've found that those with more strains and higher counts work best. Oddly though, Digestive Advantage, which is a single strain probiotic that you can get at the local drug store worked very well for me. I ran out of the one I was on and bought it as a stop gap until the new one I had ordered arrived. I used it for 3 months before changing to the new one.You just have to experiment with different one's to see what works best. If you have IBS-D, beware of products that contain Inulin, or other ""prebiotics"". They're supposed to help the probiotics multiply in the gut, but can cause cramps and gas!"
5,Really works,I use to have to go to the restroom a few minutes after I ate. I should say run to the restroom with no warning. I started taking 2 of these a day and a day or 2 no more racing to the restroom. I was amazed. It works great.
5,Tracks are...,1. I Can't Give You Anything But Love2. My One And Only Love3. After You've Gone4. Undecided5. Venupelli Blues6. Tea For Two7. I'll Never Be The Same
2,I'm wondering of this is a legal copy.,"I was taken back by how stripped-down the packaging appeared with so little description on the back, just ""Title: Alfred Hitchcock's 'Waltzes From Vienna' Studio: PRS Release Date: December 9 2009 Disc: DVD"" and a barcode.The start of the movie merely had a start button. There were no chapters or setup links. Even the Warner Archive DVDs are better than this. It played fine & the quality was passable, considering the movie's age.I've never bought an illegal copy of anything. Is this how they look? It makes me uneasy to own it."
4,Very good sharpening steel,"I purchased this sharpener and about 4 other various sharpeners with different surfaces (diamond, ceramic, to have on hand to sharpen my knives. I am not an expert, I am a newbie and I wanted to experiment and find which various sharpening steels would help me sharpen my Wusthof Classic knives."
4,Sharpens Knives Well,"I have a few very good knives, that I keep up after every use. This sharpening rod, has kept my knives razor sharp. I was even able to revive a good knife that I had let go too long.Pro's:Very easy to sharpen my knives, and keep them sharp.Cons:1. Metal tends to wear off of the knife and onto the ceramic, making the ceramic less coaese, and therefore not able to sharpen anymore. You have to wipe down the sharpening rod each time you use it, or it will become less useful.2. No instructions to tell you about the best way to use the rod, or how to care for and maintain the rod.Suggestions:1. If you don't know how to sharpen a knife properly (I just learned myself), go to youtube and watch some how to's.2. Practice on a knife you do not care about at first to get the feel of a ceramic sharpenning rod, especially If you have expensive knives and do not want to ruin them."
4,Apple - Video converter - DVI,"This item works great! It's sad to need it,in a way, because it's at least half the size of the mac mini itself, but it beats having to buy a new display. It gets a little hot, but that has not been a problem yet. It is also expensive. The price of this unit, plus a used mini is close to the price of a used g5 (if you count selling your old cinema display) hmmm.... Well, it works great anyway!"
5,Fantastic,These are fantastic! I've gone through about 20 bags in the last couple months. Try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips. They've got a hint of saltiness to them so they go great with beer. The bulk box of 15 bags is also the most economical purchase I've found.
3,I don't like these.,"I didn't care for these, but my husband loved them. They don't taste like they are cooked or something. They are missing that certain something that comes from baking them. The ""nutty"" taste is not there."
2,"Organic lightly salted dry roasted Pumpkin seeds, unsatisfactory","These are organic, lightly salted and dry roasted, in description they were what I was looking for, what I didn't like is that some of the bags had rancid pumpkin seeds. Not all, to be fair, but some of them when I opened a bag, the pumpkin seeds tasted rancid. While at the same time of ordering these, I had raw organic pumpkin seeds (from a different site), one can taste the huge difference in freshness. I am sure that some bags were not as fresh as other bags in the same box, because, THEY TASTED DIFFERENT!!"
3,Good but Good Sense tastes better,I bought these and Good Sense and find these are OK but the Good Sense brand tastes better. So I recommend the Good Sense brand. Both appear to have been made in the US but it is hard to really know. Great snacks. Eden is handy but both come in reclosable bags.
5,Wonderful.....,"Just as I expected this product is wonderful. Flavorful and fresh. I use them crunched up in breakfast bars to add some flavor, crunch and protein. Great snack, too, or great on a salad. Give them a try. :)"
5,Pumpkin Seed from EDEN,"I ordered this product, hoping that it would be a good choice. Indeed it was, and is. I am glad I ordered a good number of them They taste very good, are fresh, and the do not contain an excessive anount of salt.Gonzo"
3,Eden pumpkin seeds,"About 10% of seeds are tiny and burned so nutritions are gone, otherwise they're good and tasty."
3,Not Overly Salty,If you are looking for pumpkin seeds that are roasted and only lightly misted with Atlantic sea salt these might make you happy. They are not my favorite because they sell some really good pumpkin seeds at my local health food store. However my husband loves these and eats them as snacks. A serving size is about 1/4 cup but I usually eat less than that. So one serving is about 200 calories.~The Rebecca Review
2,yummmmmmm,editing this review because there just isn't any taste in these things so i have ate maybe 2 or 3 packs of the caseits a boring snack to be honest
2,A struggle to get through,"I'm an avid fan of Anne McCaffrey's but only halfway through this book, I find myself asking why I keep struggling through it. The intent of the book seems to be to find as many plot twists as possible to muddy the waters. The wonderful relationships Anne McCaffrey developed between her many other characters in other series is sadly missing from the whole Acorna book series. The characters all seem one dimensional, and I couldn't care less what happens to them. I find most of the plots (and there are many going on in this book) unbelievable. Too bad I've already bought the 3rd book in this series already."
1,Learn when to stop,"I seldom cannot finish a book. This was an exception. However I did read enough to realise that this is the product of a franchise with no original thought, ponderous cliche ridden writing and cardboard cut out characters of no interest at all. When McCaffrey wrote the first Pern books, published I think in Worlds of If, they were fresh and exciting. I know writers need to earn enough to pay for rent and groceries but this book demonstrates that the use of franchise series is a mistake. The premise of the book lacks any logical basis and is plain silly. Please avoid this book at all costs."
4,A project management classic,"I worked for Keane back in the mid 1990's. I received a copy of this book from Keane, Inc. to help me with my consulting assignments.The book was written in response to the question ""why do software projects fail?"". Luckily, Keane, Inc. has had over 40 years to answer that question, and a lot of the answers are in this book.The six principles of productivity management are meant to guide aspiring project managers and consultants to avoid the pitfalls of bad project management. I followed them, and still follow them, to amazing success.I keep referring to this book, and the principles in it, throughout my career.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is one: it needs to be updated. Not that the principles have changed throughout the years, but a little brush off and revision would do a world of good.Like an old wine, this book just keeps getting better and better."
2,You'll need another book to supplement this one,"My first try at Linux--at least I got it and x-windows installed and running, after the publisher put a patch on the net--the Red Hat boot image was wrong and it couldn't load from the CD! After installation, the book becomes less than useful. It's vague, applications mentioned aren't installed (in Red Hat version), file names and paths are often wrong, and ultimately it's a poor guide to Linux. I just bought ""Discover Linux"" by IDG, and while it isn't as ""meaty"" as this book, and doesn't go into as much depth into things like networking and TCP/IP basics, it GIVES THE ANSWERS YOU NEED to enjoy and use Linux!"
2,Incompetence,The authors of the book need to update *severly*. The installation is not correct. The provided Red Hat and Caldera CD's don't have the correct files (I know b/c I use them as well @ home and at work). Several chapters are repeated verbatim to give the book the false appearence of breadth.
5,Excellent product / perfect COOKING TOOLS !,"Got these for myself and my Sweetie. True craftsmanship requires good tools. Well worth the investment and come w/ a nice stainless steel container; but dropping stuff into it was noisy; so we added a cork circle inside the container & change it periodically. All in all a ""regretless purchase"". Very Satisfied !"
4,What's chicken in Portuguese?,"The DVD has two people, a man and a woman speaking the words/phrases slowly and normally. I like the way they do this so you can learn how to pronounce the words then learn how to say the words/phrases faster, like normal conversation.There were quite a few useful words/phrases, but I would've liked it to teach me more menu items. Right now, all I can order is water, coffee, beer and wine. I have no idea what the words for fish, chicken or beef look or sound like, but if I see those words, I can probably figure out how to pronounce them. I would recommend this DVD."
4,A wonderful romantic comedy,Paul Reiser is at his best and the lead actress Jesica Tuck is wonderful.
5,An aspect other than the brilliant scientific insights,"Besides natural selection, Darwin in this book laid the groundwork for ecology (doesn't use that term), and the scientific study of animal behavior. One other point which often gets overlooked is that if you can get past the Victorian prose style you will see a nearly flawless model of how to patiently build a complex argument out of a mass of raw data. The way Darwin himself brings up objections to his ideas, treats them carefully and respectfully, and then disposes of them is an example to everyone who has to deal in complex, controversial ideas. This book is one of the high water marks of the human mind."
3,Darwin,"I was completely surprised by the nature of Darwin's book. I expected a book of science, but instead found it to be more of a book of philosophy. Darwin had a vast knowledge of the natural world based on his personal observations and the observations of other natural scientists. In his book he describes interesting phenomenon and attempts to explain a natural, random process by which these things could occur. He was smart enough to recognize the limitations of his explanations, and tried to deal with them with more theories of how his ideas could work despite their obvious shortcomings. Unfortunately, his preemptive arguments come across as somewhat strained and difficult to believe. As a result, I found his theories interesting, but not necessarily compelling. Darwin's book reads more like the musings of Plato then a work of science."
2,The Origin of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition,"This is the book I ordered but is not the book I received. I received The Origin of The Species by Charles Darwin---NOT the 150th Anniversary Edition. Needless to say, since this is a Christmas gift for my grandson, I am very disappointed. Maybe he will enjoy it anyway."
2,New Origins could it be -,"The animals are de - evolving. Less DNA being accessed due to different threats and food sources for each animal group. Animals are changing because they are outside of the collective. Not from life that we can see with the naked eye, other animals. Why some are not afraid of other animals, but from microscopic organisms; bacteria and viruses (lack of exposure) on islands. Darwin was not aware of these. Survival of the sickest (in isolation). Traits (mutations) ""tells"" who is healthiest in the isolated group to be the ""healthiest"" strongest against the next mutation carried by insects in the environment. Life structures we can't see influences the design of the shape of the life; we do see."
3,Origin of the Species,"Difficult going for a non-biologist. But well worth the effort. Provides excellent insight into the depth of Darwin's study and research, and his analysis of the theory."
1,This is a Forgery,"As the sub-title to this ""Special"" ""On the Origin of Species"" version attests, it seems some of the christian persuasion have gone and done it again. This time taking a classic text and altering it to fit their agenda. This particular version adds little lies and deceptions I'm sure the Darwin family takes issue with. I expect no less of the ignorant to defame and use lies and deceptions to keep their true religious views from being known, but it's hard to believe Amazon would allow this forgery to be displayed and distributed as a book by Darwin. The Darwin family has been notified just in case they were not informed by Amazon that they are promoting this thing. Please download or obtain the real ""On the Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin. Not this christian version."
2,Origin of Species - just a theory,"The first book I bought was the paperback edition - the print was too small for me to read. I then purchased the hardback edition - the print was fine on this one. The overall material is good for a reference since this book is referred to often in the field of evolution. However, Darwinism is just a theory with no credibility, in light of recent findings in astrophysics and microbiology. As Darwin says in his own book - if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. The Big Bang in cosmology, irreducible complexity and DNA information coding in microbiology make Darwin's theroy break down. I recommend the DVDs Unlocking the Mystery of Life and Journey toward Creation as supplemental material. Also the book by Michael Denton - Evolution: a Theory in Crisis."
1,Bogus theory,"This mans theories have been taken too far. Sure he wrote the book well but the content is laughable. In order to prove the theory proposed, he requires future findings of fossils that, to this day, haven't been found yet. 1/5 Stars for Charlie."
1,An interesting fable,"This book is a very interesting work of fiction. Its too bad that so many people take it seriously, though. Darwin had a great imagination, but with no scientific evidence to support it, its just a fable. I can't believe people are so gullible as to believe the things written in here. I'm judging it as a work of fiction. Its imaginative, but its lacking. One star."
3,"Darwin's ""Origin of Species""","If you're looking for a ""primer"" on the subject of evolution, this isn't it. I found the prose quite tedious and repetitive. Long antiquated sentence structure reliving previous statements of observation over and over again; this makes for ho hum boring reading. If, by chance on the other hand, you are a non-believer of evolution and the now well known processes involved, reading Darwin with an eye on its significance in history is of course quite educational. This work is of a lifetime of accurate and insightful observation, years ago, when technology was, at best, limited. It's difficult in today's knowledge accumulated society to put oneself back into the mid 1800's and appreciate Darwin's remarkable insights, irrespective of his tedious prose. Not for the average reader . . ."
3,"Well written, not even close to believable","Some readers are bothered more than others by gross factual errors and implausibilities in a crime novel. I am one of the sensitive ones. While Eistelman's writing is fluent and adept and he knows how to move a story along, I can't ignore his unfamiliarity with basic military information in a book with a military background.For example: One character,an Army veteran, is stated to have been a ""lieutenant j.g.,"" a Navy rank, unknown in the Army. Another was a Marine and a West Point graduate -- not an impossible career path, but Annapolis would have been far more plausible. But what really stands out is that we have a character taking delivery of a stolen Polaris missile and storing it in his basement. It must have been some basement as the Polaris was almost 30 feet high. (The book's ultimate McGuffin turns out to be even less believable, but describing it would be a spoiler)."
4,Amos Walker is the MAN,"The author's protagonist is the best. The story is, as usual, tense, funny, and worth a read. Author made one error but I could not contact him for a correction. Does not take away from a great story."
3,A little tricky at times,"My two year old boy loves this bridge. But he gets frustrated with it from time to time because it rotates so easily....making his trains fall. And any parent who has a child who loves trains, knows how frustrating this can be for them. I ended up putting a piece of sticky tac on the bridge so it wouldnt move. And if my son wants it to rotate he just removes the sticky tac. My only suggestion would be that it was made with a lock on it. Otherwise my son loves it."
4,works well,the kid likes it for sure. would be nice if it locked into place though. not sure what is supposed to go under it too
1,Doesn't work as advertised...,"Added a few pounds lately, and I was excited about yhis product. The instruction book is poorly written, and the results are terrible!"
5,Inch Master,"Bought this pant stretcher based on other reviews that the other ones online were pretty flemsy. I've used in for a month and this thing works! I can button my pants without nearly have a stroke. Just be sure to follow the directions and get the waist band wet. As a tip, I marked the threads near the end with a permenant marker so i know when to stop stretching. If you keep turning past my line, it will come apart, and, of course you have to start all over. Thanks, DD in Kansas"
3,Yoke of clamp easily broken,"The interior yoke of the clamp which holds each end of the waistband is easily broken if one tries to gain over 1-1.5 inches in waistband, or if the handle in the clamp is tightened too tightly. A strengthening of the interior yoke could solve many problems. I have had two yokes to break!"
5,Works as advertised......,"This gadget really works as advertised. At first in may seem silly putting your pant in a vise, but it is easy to use, and really does stretch the waist line of your jeans. Just soak the waistline of your jeans in water, and apply the stretcher. Overnight your jeans will dry to the desired width you prefer. Now you don't have to squeeze into those tight jeans, once they come back slightly shrunken from the laundry."
1,Waste of money,I followed the directions to the letter but after I stretched the waist and let the Jeans dry overnight and removed the INCH-MASTER the waist returned to it's original size before I could put the Jeans on!!! I remain very disappointed that I'm out he money that could have been spent to purchase the correct size jeans that I needed.............Shame on me for trying to save a buck
5,Powerlessons which translate into lifetime relationships,"I began using Dr. Melanie's Parenting 101 book in 1984 when I had a new baby. I quickly realized that this was the most significantly positive step I could take in executing the most important job in the world; and I never looked back! I still use Dr. Melanie's principles with my son who is now 15 years old, and truly, I believe to be a well developed human being. I am eternally grateful to have been given the opportunity to apply this information from the ""beginning."" Blessed are the educators for they empower us all."
5,This easy to read book should be at the top of your list.,parenting 101 is well laid out and to the point.I have a 2 year old and a 6 month old and found so many great tips.The topics cover everything from discipline to home made toys.I have read quite a few books and found this one to be one of my favorites.I think every new and old parent should read parenting 101 because kids DON'T come with instructions.
1,Worst chemistry book ever,"Be prepared to sit with the tutor, because the book is so boring. The examples are not in a real situation. Not helpful.. So boring that by the time you do the problems you are ready for bed. If this is the required text buy a chemistry help book bc this books bottom line is awful, poorly written."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This,This article was barely a page long. I found better information for free via Google. This was a complete rip off. I may have to print and post a video of this later to show how pathetic this Biography turned out to be.
5,One of the best movies ever,"I love this movie. It is rare to find a nice movie that is founded on religion that has a goodStory, has humor and just makes you feel good. Loretta Young is wonderful and the supporting cast is great. My favorite scene in the movie is the meeting between the two nuns and the gangster who owners the land they hope he will donate. Absolutely, priceless."
5,An Old Sentimental Christmas Movie,"I love old movies. I mean really old movies...the kind of movies that were made before I was born. The kindof movies that have a good solid story and really good actors like, Jimmy Stewart, Errol Flynn, Bette Davis,Cary Grant, Loretta Young, Irene Dunne, etc.This movie didn't disappoint me. It has a good plot. After WWII, two nuns, from France, come to America tobuild a hospital. They arrive with no money, no where to stay, only with faith that they could accomplish thisgreat task. This simple story has humor, good actors, Loretta Young and Celeste Holm, and (if you are feelinga little sentimental) it's a good Christmas movie. It's filmed in black and white."
1,??? Jaded and Cynical ???,"I loved this movie when I was a kid. I thought the Nuns charming and sweet, a funny warm, moving story. Somethings should stay in the past. I saw a review that called it a gentle saga. Sure, it's gentle alright, the Sisters will run over you if you don't get out of their way. The Nuns are not charming and sweet. They take advantage of people, they are concerned only with what they want and do not care how they get it. They take over Amelia Potts home, she's an artist, and ends up having to paint outside on the hill there's no room for her. I'm going to stop here. This actually made me angry how rude and self centered they are and to think I ever liked it."
4,Guile and Faith,"I have been searching for 2-3 years to find this movie, having seen it on television and never knowing its actual title. Once informed, I had to write about it to tell you how wonderful this movie is.This movie is about two nuns who come from France to keep a vow made during wartime. Their hospital was not bombed during the war, so they had promised God they would come to America and found a hospital to St. Jude. (The patron saint of hopeless causes). They are drawn to a particular town, Bethelehem, because of an artist who works and paints at a stable there.They come with almost no money, certain that they can raise the funds. They have a chosen a site for the hospital, but it is owned by a known racketeer. They know nobody in the area, but manage to work their way into the hearts of most of their neighbors. They persevere til the very last day... will they ever build their hospital? With faith in their hearts, they know they will."
1,Lousy DVD Quality,"We have had this movie in VHS format for years and have been looking for it in DVD format. I was unaware when I ordered it that it was coming from a supplier in San Diego called Scarydvds@gmail.com and the producer of the DVD is Media Asia Group. The quality of this DVD is like looking at a bad copy of a home video. The focus is very unclear and sometimes the voices are not matching the lips of the actors. If I had known this in advance, I would never have bought from this group. We will continue to watch this holiday favorite on our VHS player and hope that an authorized digital version will come out soon. The DVD copy I just bought will soon go in the trash."
4,Old time entertainment.,"Great movie, although a bit syrupy at times. Probably one of Loretta Young's and Celeste Holmes' better movies. I would recommend this."
5,Great Christmas Flick,We loved our DVD Come to the Stable.It arrived promptly and in excellent condition.It is definitely a Christmas Classic!We enjoyed and have shared our unique find onAmazon.com with family and friends. They won't bedisappointed. Thanks for a great movie to our collection!
3,Great Movie,"I purchased this movie knowing that it was slightly used. The volume was not good and I think this was a copy or a copy was made off of it. My experience from the past when copying, lines will show up at times. I just wish the volume was better. Its still a great movie."
4,I was there,"Dave Tuller captures the essence of our experience but you sort of had to be there. Remember, this was 1992 Russia. We were followed by KGB the whole time because we dared have a ""kiss-in"" in front of Moscow City Hall. A whole bunch of gay/bi/straight radicals demanding fair treatment in that environment, it was crazy. He also misses the visit to the AIDS ward where we met people who had not been touched, hugged or kissed since they were locked up. It was heartbreaking.Dave's a good friend, a good writer, and a great photographer. Well worth reading."
5,Beautiful and insightful,"'Cracks in the Iron Closet' deserves a large readership. As well as being one of the few books out there to observe and address homosexuality in Russia, it happens to be beautifully written and thoroughly engaging. Tuller has a lyrical talent for description and an incisive ability to present people and places with just a few strokes, never labouring his points, never forcing opinions on the reader.To the westerner Russia may always be a mystery, an enigma, a riddle, but Tuller immerses his reader in the spirit of the harsh and strange world of the post-Soviet Union just as he immerses himself: the book contains a delicate and precious truth about Russian life and sexuality. Recommended.by Will Davis, Author of 'The Trapeze Artist' and 'My Side of the Story'"
4,Great Book,"The book Stonecold was a great story. It was about a kid who failed out of law school and his friends got him into poker. He continues to win big and figures out he is really good at it, then he loses big, he loses a 30,000 jackpot on a bluff. His dad gets irritated and tells him to quit poker and go to law school again. He quits just like his dad wanted but soon realizes that he loves poker to much and decides to go back to it. He enters in a tournament in Vegas for a shot to beat the King of Poker. The King goes all in but this time he doesnt fall for a bluff and goes all in too. He wins and ends up with 3 million dollars and is the new King of poker. This is a must read book!"
1,Dangerous,"I've had two GoFit yoga balls in a row and both have exploded after moderate use. The first time, the bottom ruptured on a seam but the ball deflated slowly so I had time to prevent a fall. The second time, I was just sitting on the ball in lotus position when the entire ball came apart under me and caused a painful fall.For the record, I'm 5'11"" and 195 pounds."
3,Good but leaks slowly,This is a nice ball and quite large but I have to re-inflate it every few days.
4,A Comfortable Bounce,"I used this ball as a chair alternative in my office, and it served me faithfully for about 8 months. Sadly, I rolled onto a very sharp staple of unknown origin. The ball deflated gracefully, allowing me to dismount well before I was close to the ground. I'll happily recommend this ball, with the caveat that I bought it for $20 and it's gone up to $25 as of this review. I think I'm going to buy another of these anyway, because I like the texture of this ball better than the others."
3,Good customer service...,"I had a ball burst on me two months after purchase. I had been using very frequently. They have a 1 year warrantee and the friendly customer server person happily replaced the ball. Naturally I would prefer that it had not broken, but it could have very well been a manufacturing defect. For the price I think I got a good deal."
3,sturdy but doesn't seem to hold air,"I have the 65 cm version of this ball which I use to work out with and it stays inflated. I bought the 75 cm to use as a chair. It seems to slowly deflate after a few hours of sitting. The plug is very hard to remove. But once it's inflated, it's perfect for a chair.It is comparable in quality to the Duraball, which was recommended by my personal trainer, but much cheaper."
5,Great product!,"The ball is very sturdy, the color is bright, the product arrived quickly just as promised."
2,Random size ball,"I bought two balls. One came as a 75cm ball. The other is a 65cm ball. Unless you want a random size ball, don't order this product."
2,It's a piece of pooh!,"I don't understand why every says the quality is so good. It's mediocre, at best. If you use photo paper only, it's passable. But if you would like to print a picture on your newsletter or report (even on top quality printer paper) it looks nasty. I get better results with the old HP clunker at school.It clogs. It uses massive amounts of ink cartridges. I hate it..."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Buy something else, if there were a zero star option I would have given it.Now on the plus side when it works the prints are excellent.But the trouble is with the ""when it works"" !Every time I try and print anything seems the heads are always clogged, it then takes numerous cleaning cycles and LOADS of VERY expensive ink to clean.Oh and then your cleaning the black head (using color ink as well) after the fifth cycle, its almost cleared the clog.... you get the ""color ink low - change color ink cartridge"" guess what you just used up all your color ink cleaning the black headSometimes cloggs midway through printing a 10 x 8 print..... very anoying.I just bought a Canon ip 4000 so this ones in the trash!"
2,A sad excuse for a printer,"Once you get past all the caveats, this prints great pictures, but BEFORE you get there you get pretty mad at the printer. The initial set up isn't as easy as for any other printer I've ever set up. Inserting a cartridge isn't intuitive -- there are little fragile plastic stabilizers that you will break if you try it the way you think it should be. Once you've got everything set up right, the printer STILL keeps needing its heads cleaned everytime you let it sit for a couple days without being used. The cartriges get used up extremely fast to begin with for this printer, and head cleaning uses up even more ink.Don't let the price of this printer fool you. You will be paying through the nose for tons of ink cartriges, and taking it on the chin with the constant cleaning and recalibrating."
3,What do you expect?,I have had this printer for almost 2 years. I use the cheapest ink I can find and YES I use it with XP.I think it is JUST FINE. If you want upscale prints buy an upscale printer. I have another Epson printer that I tried to use tech support and EPSON TECH SUPPORT is equivilant to DRUNK MONKEYS....at best. I find OEM Epson ink is horrible. CLogs worse than anything and is stupidly expensive. BUY GENERIC.Try Voltexx.com for cheap ink.I have let this printer sit for weeks (6-8) and used it. YES I have to run headcleaning several times. But I buy CHEAP INK !!!!NUFF SAID.
2,Cinderella printer,"This printer worked great... for about a year, and then turned back into a pumpkin. Printouts started getting ugly stripes and splotches of random ink. Repeated printhead cleanings didn't help much either. If you're looking for a good printer that lasts, stay away Epson and check out Canon or HP."
2,Paper feeder will drive you nuts!,"I didn't buy this on Amazon but wish I had come to see the negative reviews first!Print quality is fair, but does seem to go through the printer cartridges awfully fast.But the most annoying thing is how it loads paper - or doesn't! It grabs several sheets simultaneously, so that you have to stand there and feed it one sheet at a time.If you don't, it will take so many it clogs the machine, chews up the paper, leaves a black smear on everything and sounds like it's going to die.If you put in only a few sheets to prevent this problem, it will still grab them all and then start making a loud ""protesting"" noise when it's out.I always talk back to it and tell it that it's the printer's own damn fault for being a paper hog. See - that's how annying it is - you end up cursing it out every time you print more than one page!!So I would not recommend it!"
3,You get what you pay for,"For $50 you can't really complain too much. The print quality is really good but the print heads tend to fail. When I called to return my second one the operator said she had the same problem with hers, either the color or the black cartridge will just stop working. I can't imagine you'll find a better quality print for the money but don't expect longevity."
2,Looks great--if you use your whole cartridge in one day.,"Like another reviewer, I have spent more time running back to the store to have them replace ""defective"" ink cartridges (and the whole printer initially!) than actually printing anything. I had the retailer replace the ink cartridges FIVE times before I realized there is simply something WRONG with this printer. The black is the worst--after the first day of printing, it clogs (or whatever) and any black comes out as only a few lines. I have a photographer friend with the next printer down in this line and he has had the exact same problem. An unfortunate waste of time and money."
1,I will never again buy an Epson printer,"This is the 2nd Epson Stylus I have owned. The first worked fine for about 6 months, then I had constant problems with clogged heads requiring numerous cleaning cycles and wasting the very expensive ink. I thought that if I bought a newer, better (more expensive) model that I would not have the same problems. Boy was I wrong! It's the exact same story with the new printer. I know it's a relatively inexpensive printer but it should last longer than 6 months. Never again! I am finished with Epson."
1,Clogged Print heads,Replacing this printer. The print heads clog all the time if you do not shut the printer off each time after using. Cannot leave on a network. Ink is expesnive because when you run out of one color the whole cartridge has to be replaced. Reading the reviews here confirmed what i had feared that there was a design flaw here and that i was wasting my money on ink cartridges. It is cheaper to just buy a new printer than to keep on buying cartridges for this lemon.
5,Are you kidding?,"How can anyone doubt that at [$], this is perhaps the absolute best printer value we have ever seen. I haven't yet used it for it's photo capabilities, but if it flunks that test big time, it is still an incredible deal !!"
1,Clogged printer head,"Spent most of the time trying to clear the printer head from clogging, unsuccessfully I might add. I gave up on it and looking to purchase another printer. This is definitely the worst printer I have ever come across."
4,This is a winner,This is a good buy for your money. It is a dirt cheap price for a quality photo printer. I can hook it into my lap top with little effort and it takes up little space on my desk.
2,BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT BUYING THIS PRODUCT!!,"The printer is dirt cheap but you end up making up for it if you use alot of ink. I'm writing this review out of fustration. I bought this printer at the beginning of September. It is now the end of October and this is my second time having to purchase ink. this is not acceptable at $50 dollars a pop for the black and color cartridges combined. It definately does not suit my needs. I don't necessary blame Epson I blame the salesperson who sold it to me. I told him I was a student and I would be using the printer for printing out reports, articles, etc. and he said this would be perfect. BE CAREFUL BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT! THE LOW COST MAY NOT BE WORTH IT!!!"
1,This product does not work!,"The side of the box for this printer lists the ""system requirements"" and includes Macintosh System 10.1 or higher as a compatible system. Great, because that is the platform and I needed a printer that prints true borderless printing. After HOURS of working with the printer, we called Epson. ""We don't support borderless printing with system X."" Wonderful. So the box lies, the printer doesn't do what I purchased it to do, and Epson now has had the printer returned."
3,Would buy new next time,"I have have nothing against refurbished or ""reconditioned"" items. Most times they are a great deal, and it's hard to tell the difference from new. This time is different though. The pump and pedestal I received looks well used, especially the pedestal. It has many scratches and even chips on the bottom. This same pump brand new sells for only about $20 more. I thought about returning it, but it does work, and will only be used in case of emergency. If you want to save a few bucks, then it may be worth it to you, but I was not expecting to receive a reconditioned pump that looks like it was used for some time, and was just boxed up and sent out. Seeing how some other people got pumps that were in ""like new"" condition, it may just be hit or miss."
1,Didn't last,This sump pump lasedt less than a week and then there were problems with the switch turning on the motor. Spend a little money and get something of quality. You won't regret it when your basement stays dry.
4,great bench for dumbbell workouts,"This is my first bench for dumbbell exercises. It's a great buy for the price. Works nicely, very sturdy, and very reliable. I give it 4 out of 5 stars simply because the gap between the bottom seat and the top bench is a bit too much for my liking. Recommended"
4,stationary seat,"So this bench looks great and was relatively easy to assemble. It is also light enough to carry around and move from one place to the other. The wheels are not very well positioned for rolling this bench around. The only down side is that the seat does not raise up, so it is not as comfortable to do inclined or declined presses on this.The saving grace is the leg brace attachment that isn't shown in the display pictures online. Placing your legs behind the cushioned leg brace presents you from sliding off the bench when doing heavy inclined presses.Super saving shipping was also very quick. Ordered on friday night and got my bench the following tuesday."
4,Almost Perfect,"Very sturdy, incline angle great for bench press, easy to adjust and assemble. Only wish the seat could be adjusted to keep you from sliding down when the back is inclined. They tried to compensate for this by adding a lower leg pad that is supposed to serve this purpose, but is a bit cumbersome. Overall nice bench but not perfect."
2,"Received damaged product, just not damaged enough","The bench is poorly packed for shipping, there were holes in the box indicating punctures during transit. I received the bench with a two inch tear in the bench back cushioning. Now, I could try to return that part of the bench, maybe return the whole bench, or get some red electrical tape next time I'm at the Hardware store, tape up the tear and just go on. I'm going the electrical tape route....."
1,Bowflex 3.1 Bench Review,"Very dissatisfied with this product. I have contacted Bowflex and will wait to see what they have to say. The bench was fairly easy to assemble. However, when I finished putting it together it won't fit in the slot for the 90 degree positon. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend this for purchase. I also wouldn't recommend it being purchased online as well. If something is wrong, it could be a hassle to ship it back to the sender. If I assembled it wrong or it's a minor thing I will update this accordingly."
2,Not for sit ups,This bench is very sturdy and would be good for free weight workouts. I bought it to do sit ups and it just doesn't work. The leg hold down brace is positioned awkwardly and because the back support declines but the bottom support doesn't you end up in between the two pieces. Bowflex doesn't offer any optional hold down braces for this bench. I've used much cheaper benches with better results. I bought this one because of the Bowflex name and the ratings about how sturdy the bench was.
1,Best value for the price,This item is of very high quality and the price was very reasonable. I could not have made a better choice.
4,4 and 1/2 stars,I love this bench. It suits my needs and works well. If it had one more position between the 1/2 way point and straight up it would be perfect. Since I bought it used at a great price it works for me. Workmanship is better than I thought at first
5,"Good, solid bench","Easy to put together, and stable while lifting. A little bit pricier than some other models, but I found it worth the money"
4,I should have ordered the 5.1 model,"I wasn't trying to break the bank when I decided to order my Selecttech setup. I went cheap on the bench and now wish I had gotten the 5.1 one. This isn't a bad bench, infact it's sturdy and easy to adjust, but the 5.1 offers extra positions, and not just frivolous ones. a 90 degree would be perfect for some of the presses I do. I think aside from the 2 extra inclines you can use with the 5.1 they are identical. I don't need the 2, but it would be nice as it could give me more work out options.But this is well built and will serve it's purpose, I'm sure you can get better benches for cheaper elsewhere, but these go well with the Selecttech's and the Stand I bought. Overall I'm happy with all 3."
4,Very useful utility bench,"The Bowflex 3.1 is very useful, easy to adjust,lightweight and heavy duty. I've had this bench for over a month now and have had no problems what so ever. It was very easy to assemble and I have used it with my power rack ever since. Very sturdy. Great product!"
3,Good bench,For a basic bench it's good.Decline isn't that good...why? You can't lock your legs in. No decline presses and decline crunches/situps.The gap for the lower back is to big.
3,"Solid, but poor position options","This is a solid bench... but sadly, due to the design, the most two common angles (other than flat) are not available for the back rest. To be really useful, they should have spent a few extra bucks and added two additional positions between full upright (vertical) and the first recline position.I think I might have to make a few extra stops and weld them on/repaint..."
5,"Given as a gift , I ordered one for me.","I love to shoot flowers, I bought the book for photos, and found text well written, and valuable. It took me 1 day after gifting it to order one for myself"
3,Just Not Big Enough,"The good thing about this book is that it covers so many areas of the music business. The problem is they spread themselves too thin. Few of the listings seemed complete. It might be enough to get started but if this book is for beginners than there seems to be a lack of tips and info. The interviews that the do have are very informative. If this book was twice, three times, or ten times as thick it could become an indespencable tool. The way the book is now I think it's probably better to go several more specialized sources."
2,Club List Incomplete,"The concept is great, but the list of clubs could easily be double the size. I was hoping to use the book to help me plan some regional touring around different parts of the US, but it hasn't helped much in some cities. (Even venues where I've played before aren't listed in the book.) The other very disappointing element of the publication is the number of advertisements. It's essentially a glorified magazine..."
4,Language Quibbles,"This book shows many useful asanas and much helpful information. It explains yoga's benefits and contraindications. However, at risk of seeming narrow-minded, I'd ask for more use of English names of the asanas, particularly in the chapter which describes four sessions. Asanas are not listed by English names, which means I find myself flipping back to the pages listed to remind myself that Adho Mukha Svanasana is simply ""Down Dog."" Used often enough, I'm sure the names will become familiar, but why not put English names in parenthesis at least? That would make the book much more accessible to beginners. Otherwise, a good book for beginners or experienced yoga practitioners."
1,impact screw driver,Product was internally rusted and did not work. It took half an hour of allot of lubrication to make it work.
1,Michelin-Not so good,"I returned it, I've found that Michelin maps in spite of their great reputation are well...not that easy to use, a major flaw is that the road numbers are in very small hard to read writing. I purchased a Hammond International France for only a bit extra, it's easy to use and and it covers the whole countryas well as major city maps etc."
1,Altitech,The compass feature requires frequent calibration. The altimeter feature also requires daily calibration. I am very disappointed in this product and would not purchase it again if I had the choice.
1,"Not rugged, inaccurate","I had this watch for about 4 months until it fell off my belt yesterday and I lost it.The pin between clip and watch broke a month ago and I repaired it with a paperclip.The thermometer was consistently 20 degrees warmer than ambient temperature.The altimeter was consistent 100 ft lower than actual altitude, even after a manual reset.The compass I didn't verify but it comes with a complicated calibration procedure.The screen started fading after 4 months use, which fixed with reset but still annoying. Physically the face started showing a lot of wear after 4 months, just hanging off my belt.This is a cute toy but it has too many functions I don't need and the functions I didn't need didn't work right. I will replace it with the Casio Pathfinder next, I wouldn't buy from this company again. Also Timex has a similar watch on Amazon but reviews show it to be similarly inaccurate, Casio is apparently the gold standard for this kind of gadget."
2,Not as rugged as it looks,"Highgear AltiTech Computer Watch with Altimeter, Compass, and Thermometer (Shadow)I have had this product for a year. Last week, it broke off of the carabiner and I lost it. I wasn't treating it roughly, it disappeared when I was riding on the train on the way home, and all I have left is the carabiner.Other than that, the face scratched easily. I work as a gardener, so it was often exposed to dirt. I tried keeping it protected, but that wasn't easy to do.Also, the buttons would get pressed when I was wearing it, and I'd have to reset it from time to time. I'd like a way to lock the settings, because I had trouble remembering all of the steps to get back to where I started.I liked the watch, and would have happily put up with its idiosyncrasies if I hadn't lost it. I'd like to find a similar watch that holds up better."
1,Nicely designed and expensive toy,"Nice design and build, but only useful as a watch.Altimeter is wildly inaccurate. Sitting on my desk it can fluctuate 100 feet within a day. How am I suppose to trust it for navigation? My GPS altimeter, bad as it is, is still more accurate than this thing.By constantly calibrating the altimeter, I can get a good barometric reading. This number does not correlate to the weather station number that is located down the street. But, the trend is similar. As for predicting the weather, which is why I bought this thing, it is not any better than my own guess looking at the sky.As is, this is not an extra weight I am willing to add to my hikes."
4,A great add for anyone on the mountain,"Although the Thermometer responds a bit slower, over all the AltiTech is just great. I use in on my ski jacket to keep track of factors in the lessons I conduct. It's small, light weight and easy to read."
4,works well for mountaineering,"I use it mountaineering for the watch, timer, and altimeter with the altimeter in particular being an invaluable aid for orienteering. I have matched the altimeter with my friends Thomens and it is very accurate. For those that say that the altimeter wanders, well, altimeters will tell you different elevations for the same spot sometimes by hundreds of feet depending on the time of day (lower in the afternoon when the air heats up)and the weather (bad weather makes you go up, good weather makes you go down). The buttons are a bit tough to press and the compass is difficult to get to line up but for a super light altimeter and watch that hangs on your belt and is easy to read it's great."
5,Pricey but delicious! Melts in your mouth!,"I am a huge fan of caramel corn. This is popcorn with a delicious, buttery glaze (that only Poppycock seems to deliver) along with the delicious addition of cashews! There are several Poppycock varieties, but I LOVE the cashew variety best. What's the first ingredient: CASHEWS! The clusters are laced with them and the combo of popcorn, delicious unadulterated Poppycock glaze and Cashews make for a delicious and slightly addictive combination.This concoction is not cheap, but WOW ... it's really good. Melts in your mouth kind of good. Absolutely, positively delicious!"
5,Memorable,"Having seen all the Lynley mysteries, this episode is among the most memorable. A few red herrings, a twist here, an unexpected revelation there, good acting and a bit of a shocker at the end.Don't normally purchase individual TV episodes, but I made an exception here."
4,For what it's worth...,"Don't mind the Beer nerds who need a book to study from so they can mock their friends on their lack of Beer knowledge. This is a coffee table book that is an interesting read, and can create coversation when you have guests over. I am a homebrewer and have used some of the descriptions to help me pick my next clone. So unless you are taking a Beer exam from grumpy-pants reviewer, buy the book and enjoy."
2,Not particularly interesting,"I had hopes for this recording after reading an interview with Anne Akiko Meyers, the violinist and dedicatee of ""Angel Fire"". She is a superb and sensitive artist whose work I admire.The recording is very disappointing. Modernist composers often disappoint me. I'm not in love with dissonance. I'm not open to aural assaults. I was unable to listen all the way through to any of the compositions on the CD.It's unclear to me if there was truly any intent to these compositions beyond the ""because I can"" reasoning that appears to dominate all segments of art. I'm being generous by giving the recording two stars."
2,Great book for Beginners,"This book is very high level and would be a great introduction to the concepts of Six Sigma, as a ASQ Certfied Black Belt in search of something for a transactional business I needed more insight than this book provides. There is nothing more frustrating than to purchase a book out of my budget and find that it doesn't live up the hype of the description and the reviews by readers.To summarize: Great book for those wanting to know what Six Sigma is and the tools associated to it. If you have experience in Six Sigma then it will disappoint."
2,Not practical for home users,"The first thing you notice about this book is that there's no color in it, which is misleading because the cover is so beautiful. I thought there would be photos of each plant and it's uses. Although it is in alphabetical order, it all sorta runs together. For practical home use, I do not recommend this book. For each plant it gives synonyms, general description, distribution, other species, herbal/folk tradition, actions, extraction, charactistics, principal constituents, safty, and FINALLY aromatherapy and home use. For me half of those catergories are of no interest. Lots of the aromatherapy and home use seems to be the same from plant to plant. It never describes how one should apply or administer these plants and essential oils for therapy. Its just not what I was looking for as far as a practical guide that you can grab and look up a certain symptom or oil..."
2,Recommended but NOT THIS edition,"This is the first edition of the acclaimed book. You want to buy an updated one - The ILLUSTRATED encyclopedia of Essential oils by the same author. The difference is huge. Not only the Illustrated version has beautiful pictures of the plants, oils, ect but it also has tons of new, updated info that the first (this) edition misses. In other words, yes, this book is kind of the basis for the Illustrated edition but it is very pale in comparison to it. I would not waste your money on this one and buy the Illustrated one, which is a must have for anybody interested in aromatherapy as one of the best references/encyclopedias out there. Hope this review is helpful in your choice."
2,get the updated publication...,"I had ordered the newer version of this book (circa 1995 or later) which is under a slightly different title (The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Essential Oils: The Complete Guide to the Use of Oils in Aromatherapy and Herbalism). I was quite disappointed to receive this version, which is not illustrated and does not have the same detail of information (i know this because i used the ""search inside this book"" capability for the one i ordered). I have emailed the seller to return it, but just thought I would post my review so that others know that it is absolutely worth buying the newer publication!"
2,"Elementary, good for pictures. Not as advanced as Worwood.",The research ability of this book is not set up as well as some. The information also is not as advanced or as extensive as some other authors. My preference would be Worwood over Lawless.
1,Beware of Sony Canada Ltd: Bad customer service for PC-101,"I bought my PC-101 from Sony Canada Ltd and in the first three months of use the touchscreen started becoming unreliable: there was a bad connection.I sent the PC-101 in for repair three times in a row. After the second time, I thought it reasonable to expect a new camera from them, or at least a new full one year warranty.They wouldn't budge on a replacement. The PC-101 was out in for repairs for a total of 3 months. They offered only to replace 3 months of the warranty.I had spent 40.00 in courier charges sending out letters to them to get them to respond to me. The consumer relations manager said in a conversation on one day that she would reimburse me for the charges, and yet on another day she had no recollection of the conversation and wouldn't budge there either.All of this boils down to a potentially great product, but buyer beware when it breaks down, because you're on your own."
3,a few alternatives,"This book looked pretty good on the shelves. There are some other good ones to consider before buying. Look at The Book of My Pet, Cat Journal: A Keepsake, and My Cat's Tale."
2,Buggy upgrade; this is JUNK!,"Editing features are pretty cool, improved from last versions.But capture is so buggy when it comes to capturing video originally shot in analog mode (like all your VHS tapes) just won't work with this software. You have to capture with another program, like CapWiz or Win DV, then edit with Video Studio.I've been using VS since version 5 and usually had no capture problems before version 11. both in XP and Vista.So unless you want to be a beta tester for Ulead (now owned by Corel) and PAY them for the privilege, forget this version for a while. Try Roxio EasyMedia Creator or Nero."
1,Dont waste your money,I had version 9 and it worked fine. I never did like the fact it took 8 hours to convert and burn the first DVD. It would not burn to a disk at all once I installed Vista so I upgraded to version 11 and it still comes up with an error when trying to covert and burn the first disk. It only works to make small mpg files for web sharing. Do Not Waste Your Money on this Product. I bought Cyberlink Power Director and it works much better and only takes an half an hour to convert and burn the first DVD.
1,HORRIBLE,"the program locks my computer up nearly every time i try to do anything. i've installed and re-installed several times. i have more than enough computer memory and a video card with enough memory as well.but in two months, i've managed to partially complete one video project of a playdate of my daughter's. and their website is awful, also.BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
1,Ulead VideoStudio 11 bad choice,"I spent days and days making a video and then when I tried to burn it, which took an hour and a half, I got error messages saying I couldn't burn it. So I try their help files and come up with a solution that also does not work. When I finally get them to answer an email inquiry they tell me to phone them at a cost of 15.00. I live overseas and the cost to call would be prohibitive. AND - WHY SHOULD I PAY TO GET HELP ON A FEATURE THAT SHOULD WORK IN THE PROGRAM? - This stinks. Don't buy this software."
5,Miliza Korjus - coloratura supreme,"This is one incredible CD. It has been transcribed expertly from the original source material, and certainly does not sound like it was recorded quite a few decades ago. How come we never get sopranos of this calibre these days? Highly recommended for anyone wanting to hear a top-notch soprano. The delivery time from Amazon was also supreme."
5,LOVE rekindled,"Oh, yeah...hearing this ""album"" again (on CD, o'course) took me on a memory trip nearly right back to where i was when i heard it for the first time. The auditory fact of the music created a physical and mental/emotional state that was really uncanny. I'm fairly ""stuck in the 60's"" musically, but i hadn't heard any Love for some reason for a very, very long time. What a rush! I almost had to say, ""Like far-out, man."" Love was quite the band and their music remains great today. What a treasure! And, btw, the shipping was quick, the cd was in great shape and i would have paid lots more for it. Thanks and Peace!"
5,What Fun!!!,"What a fun book to read!! Trying to find a children's book that will hold the attention of a 9, 10, or 11 year old can sometimes be quite a chore. This book not only holds their interest, but they enjoy the trip. Three cheers."
4,Review,"I enjoyed Cantaloup Trees and plan to read it to my 7 and 8 year old. The author's imagination was fun...you could just imagine being Penelope with her stuffed elephant Mandy. Its a good book to read with your kids, to initiate discussion about the ""evil elephant."""
1,My 10 year olds thought this book was sappy!,"After all the glowing reviews of this book I was excited. It is hard to find childrens books today that educate as well as entertain our children.Sadly, my twin ten-year-olds didn't like this book at all. I think it was obviously meant for much younger children so, to say the least, I was very disappointed...The editing was awful and the content was boring, at least to my kids. I think the premise was a good one though, but I also think the age-range that is being suggested should be adjusted! I felt cheated!"
2,You don't need it,"Interested in seeing what it takes to startup a restaurant, I bought this book. It was a compelte waste of [money]. If you have gone out to eat more than one time, you already know 90% of this book. The book seems to have little insight into the detailed aspects of starting and running a restaurant and seems to only brush the surface of important issues.The most valuable information in this book gives you a guideline as to what percent of your income should go to various restaurant operations.I suggest you check out The Restaurant Start-Up Guide. Its more detailed and is written above a 7th grade level."
4,"good, but doubtful","I'll just copy some words of the famous writer René Querido on an interview he had with Trevor Ravenscroft:RQ: Je n'entendis parler de Trevor Ravenscroft qu'après la mort de Walter Stein (le juillet 1957). Nous sommes devenus amis, toutefois je ne pouvais pas accepter de nombreuses choses qu'il faisait et déclarait. Il me poussait à écrire un livre sur le Graal, ce que je refusai. Lorsque je le rencontrai bien plus tard, en 1976, au milieu de la nuit à Londres, et que je fus sur le point de lui faire part de mes critiques sur son livre qui avait paru entre tempos, il m'interrompi en me faisant savoir qu'il ne l'avait écrit que dans le dessein de se procurer rapidement de l'argent. J'ai indiqué dans divers articles qu'un tiers de son livre concorde, qu'un autre tiers est fait de demi-vérités et que le dernier tiers n'est que le produit de son imaginatikon féconde.That's why I entered the title: good, but doubtful."
3,"Interesting, but...","..seemed like mostly hokum to me. A lot of made-up dialogue, and dubious sources. Some of the dialogue had me cracking up-a bad sign. If you liked ""Morning of the Magicians"" you will find this a good read also, but much more far-out. Remember Col. Ardenti from ""Foucault's Pendulum""? It reads a lot like his rap. I know anythings possible, but this is really far-fetched. Hitler often ridiculed the occult pretensions of Himmler, Hess and others, according to his secretaries and Albert Speer, among others.Oh, by the way, Hitler DID NOT ""reverse"" the swastika. Who came up with this crazy idea? So using that as a ""proof"" of Hitler's occultism won't work. In India, one can see swastikas of all kinds on Hindu Temples. My own Guru's ashram has them on the Temple columns, same direction as Hitler. No, they are not ""black magicians"". Peaceful yogis in fact. Another common motif is the ""Star of David"", used for centuries in India, for various esoteric purposes."
3,Good start off point...,"... but that's about it.There isn't really any 'new' information in this book - you could probably find more help by looking up whatever you need help with, on the internet. It has much more wealth of knowledge than this book does, and also in a better format since you just fnid whatever you need help with.24 hours to learn RedHat? You could get it up and running, and immediately pick it up in a much shorter time, and I know this from my first experience with Redhat, and also from what others have told me in the past."
3,MUST BE TWILIGHT PREQUEL,"MUST BE TWILIGHT PREQUEL as both stories contain feuding vampires and bad actors. Why do vampires only go after chicks that look like Denise Richards? Seems to me a fat chick would be easier to bag and would contain a few extra more days of blood. In this movie the bad vampire rips open the girl's top before he bites her neck, whereas the good vampire allows the victim to remove it. I also noticed the bad vampire got to sleep with two topless chicks. They didn't have sex, it was I bite you, you bite me, fake an orgasm then roll over and go to sleep. I guess when you get to be a few hundred years old, women don't expect too much. As far as movie ratings go, if you were to take away the nudity, subtract a star.This feature is also available as a William Shatner Fright Night DVD and as part of an 8-pack (recommended) Echo Bridge collection ""The Midnight Horror Collection."""
3,Surprisingly Fun,"OK, so on the whole, this movie is a piece of garbage. It's over-acted, it's got bad special effects, and the plot is extraordinarily simplistic. But despite these drawbacks, it ends up being pretty entertaining. The vampires are refreshingly hideous, but seem to exert a power over people that makes them appear normal, much like the glamer of Nosferatu of old. And there are several nods to Nosferatu, from the big claws to the weird shadow magic vampires seem to possess. It's filmed in a delightfully noirish way, and feels like a good old Hammer Horror classic.So yes, the plot is idiotic, and the film is over-acted, but there's a lot of fun stuff in it too. Watch it with a few beers and a few jeers: it's a fun hour and a half."
3,"sort of corny, but ok","The problem with this movie is that it uses to many scenes from the subspeices series.Plus it is to much like Interview With a Vampire,which was a lot better than this.It has some good parts and some that are very boring. I do not reccomend this to vampire movie fans."
2,Should satisfy your vampire cravings for a while,"While this production does not display the high standards of script writing one expects from most major releases, this small release is full of delectable vampire imagery and flair. With the complexity and literary depth of a TV pilot, the Vampire Journals is only for true vampire fans, as most other viewers will be turned off by the shallowness of characters and the story's lack of significance. However, this production does have many scenes of neck biting, sword fighting, a few beheadings, and more than enough shots of vampires drinking blood to satisfy your vampire movie cravings for a while. END"
4,an okay vampire flick,"Vampire Journals is a take-off of the Subspecies series from Full Moon, but it stands on it's own as it only makes one brief reference to that aforementioned series. As a horror film, I would say the movie is sub-par. It's never really scary; it's more of a gothic Dark Shadows-esque drama featuring vampires and the sad life they lead. Some of the dialogue is hilariously bad, but the story is fairly well written and paced and the acting is well above average for a Full Moon flick of this caliber. Lots of blood, lots of nudity, and moderate gore should please splatter enthusiasts, however mainstream horror fans should stay away. But if you are a fan of Full Moon, I can't help but recommend this film."
2,Cloying syrup.,"The constant,unchanging melodrama score is only out-cheesed by the atrocious over acting by every member of the cast. Very stupid vampire movie that drags on and on."
1,"...and yet somehow, I managed to buy it.","I had such a laugh over the other review, I had to write my own. If you read the other review, it's totally true. This movie is good for a laugh, the plot goes nowhere, and you should see the subspecies movies for a little bit of backround. However, eventhough it got a bad review, there is something about this movie that makes me turn it on at least once a week. It's probably a pressing need to make me hate myself for at least two hours a week, or maybe it's because Cassandra is a ""Betty"". Either one of the two. However, ""Vampire Journals (The title was an obvious rip from Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire""), is good for a few laughs. If you like cheasy horror flicks and vampire movies...this is MUST."
1,Waste of time....,I thought this movie would be interesting to watch. I was wrong. Even as a fan of vampire movies in general I found that this movie was trite and very tedious. The setting was good and all the buildings were very rich and gothic.... the acting was atrocious. I found myself laughing at times because the actors were just BAD... There are other movies to see that are much more worthy.
4,"""the ones who stole me from the warmth of the sun""","A vampire with a mortal's heart travels the world hunting the undead, sworn to distroy his entire bloodline....""The ones who stole me from the warmth of the sun"" But one of the most powerful masters, Ash, still remains and has captured the beautiful Sofia, a pianoist, who has also grasped the hunter's hunter heart... END"
3,Vampire Journals or SubSpecies3 1/2,"This was a fun purchase just to keep in the collection. A Big Hint, watch SubSpecies 1,2,3,4 in any order before hand just one or all before you buy, because if not you won't get Vampire Journals. Ted Nicolaou did a good job making a frame story fit within a series, but here lies the problem. You kinda had to remember which frame it was put in. Was it SubSpecies 2, 3, or somewhere between 3, and 4. Vampire Journals would at best be labled 3 1/2 if I had to make a guess.The Sound quality was lower than expected, but then again, the music was the loudest thing on the DVD. The acting was good for what it's worth, tormented by the plot. The period clothes were awesome to watch and get ideas, but other than that, Vampire Journals is fun to watch after you've seen the rest of the Series."
4,not bad for a b,it's not a terrible b movie it has some great things and some bad things. as a girl to many unneeded boon shots but other that good
3,Not bad,"If you are into vampires, you'll like this video, otherwise its a little slow and not too spooky. THe piano music is interesting.Vampire Romantic Piano Diaries And Journals"
5,Great Vampire Flicks!,I enjoyed watching this movie and think if you are as big a vampire movie fan as I am this is a good addition to your collection.
3,Liked the look,"What I liked about this movie was the atmosphere, or ambience. The old buildings,etc.It had the feel that vampire fans go for.A little corny, but fun.From the reviews I read before buying it, I knew what to expect and wasn't disappointed."
3,Beaufully Filmed,"This is a beautifully filmed and chorographed piece. It is full of lovely gothic settings, lighting, costumes, faces and bodies. For the Vampire and Gothic geniera fan this alone makes the film worth while. The acting is uneven going from mediorcer to bad. The droning self pieting voice over makes Interview with a Vampire seem exciting in comparison. The later is decidedly the superior film. But for shear setting this is a bonanza. Just the thing to play on a wide screen TV with the sound off during a party."
2,dissapointing,"While the movie looked passable (you can hide a lot in the fog of smoke they pumped into every scene), the acting was so bad and the characters so weak and bitchy that the whole thing left a foul taste in my mouth- and thats hard to do as I'm very forgiving of vampire movies. Without anything to really dig your teeth into, this flick will leave you dissapointed and maybe even annoyed. Its a shame really..."
3,Subspecies 3 1/2,"This can be considered Subspecies 3.5 as it takes place between Subspecies 3 & 4, and some characters from Vampire Journals even turn up on Subspecies 4. Though not near as good as the Subspecies series, this is still worth a look. Great atmosphere and lighting. What this film suffers from is sub-par acting. Sure everyone looks good in the film, but the acting hinders it. This film is still a must for Subspecies fans and worth a look for Ann Rice fans, because the subject material is closely related to Interview With the Vampire, only with a much lower budget."
1,Belt K040347,"I bought both belts for my car from Amazon. When I bought this item, it clearly stated that ""it fits Mazda Protege 1998, 1.8 liter. When I recently took them to my mechanic, one was fine, but this one did not fit my car. Since the day (Oct. 18) passed, I can't get the refund, except a partial, which will not be worthy because the shipping will probably cost as much as the ""partial refund"".So, make sure, you check with some other places, if what you buy from Amazon really fits your car, because you can't trust what Amazon said.I will try to see if I can sell it through e-Bay, even though I don't really know what type of car really fits. If not, I will probably give it away."
3,Too Clunky,"Well, the pitcher is attractive enough, although the glass is fairly thick and clunky. The problem is that it's too heavy to use easily, especially at the table. FYI, I weighed it on my Salter kitchen scale: empty, it weighs 2 lbs. 9 oz, full - 6# 2 oz., with ice insert 6 lbs., 13 oz. Overall, it's an OK pitcher for the money, but heavy and awkward."
3,Much smaller than expected,I thought these would be bigger. I will keep them just because it's too much of a hassle to send them back.
3,"""For What It's Worth"" Review","Not nearly as good as his previous special, ""Killing Them Softly"", Dave Chappelle's new cable stand-up special may have been destined to come off feeling mediocre in comparison. After a star-making second season of his hit comedy series, ""Chappelle's Show"", Dave seems less hungry on the second go round. Touching such subject matter as fame, intercourse with monkeys, and famous black celebrity trials, ""For What It's Worth"" is a hardly a failure in the humor department but it just isn't the home run that ""Softly"" was. It's a good time nonetheless."
4,It's Worth Quite A Bit,"Chappelle's accessibility (and his racially charged & sympathetic humor) sparkle in this live stand-up appearance. This guy is about as likable as it gets, his characteristic wit pulling the audience in even as it knuckle-rubs their heads. On this disc, Dave discusses everything from crackheads (no surprise there), Native Americans, smoking in public, the American justice system, and grape juice. Even when his humor is topical (e.g. OJ and Michael Jackson), it retains a sense of warmth and giggle-worthy rib-nudging that makes this recording both hilarious and re-watchable. The only drawback is that it is lamentably short (it barely clocks in at an hour) and the disc is notably lacking in any special features whatsoever."
3,It's ok,"I really enjoy Dave Chappelle and his stand-up sets, but this isn't one of his greatest - at least in my opinion."
5,The New Richard Pryor,"Dave Chappelle is the Richard Pryor of his time. His honest humor and edgy style brings a mixture of demographics. True that some people don't understand it and get upset; but if you take it for what is worth (like the name of the title) you will find yourself laughing harder than you thought you could. For What It's Worth holds as an instant classic with his awesome routine. However, I see that people are comparing it to Killing Them Softly, saying it not as great. But that's not true! It's remarkable. Forget what the others say, it's Chappelle, he's always funny. So Lighten up and watch it."
3,Motherfather!!!,"There is a theme here in this near-hour of comedy: Chappelle's obsession with his loins. From the beginning joke with his Matrix-dodging of a fluid mike, to the end with his discovery of what his son is, we get a stoner-ephiphany of what the father-function is. Perhaps pure Chappelle, undiluted, free of the Comedy Channel. Unlike in his 30 min Comedy Central show, here Chappelle is able to sketch out in full his twisted, devious, and comedic genius. This show feels more like art, but it does not make good tv. With less bellyaching laffs than a Chappell's Show, this still gives us a raw look at his talent...for better or worse."
3,Saved by satire,"Dave is very funny, but his real ability does not come to the fore in this performance. He is a better satirist than stand-up comedian in this particular performance. Some of the jokes are mildly amusing and they are fairly well-sprinkled through the performance. It is disappointing though, because Dave has the potential to be second only to Chris Rock.It is probably worth seeing this dvd, but it's far fromb being a classic."
5,Top 3 Fav Stand Up of all Time!,Really hard to keep it to the word limit without feeling like i'm taking away from what is one of the best stand up comedy routines i've ever watched. actually i feel this way about his other two as well. amazing. could watch it over and over...
4,Very funny!!!,"This isn't the best I've seen of Chappelle, but it's definitely funny. I bought it after seeing clips on youtube (bits on ""grape drink"", Kobe Bryant, and being held hostage on a bus were some of the funniest)."
5,Dave Chappelle is F***ing Funny,Dave Chappelle's best work before he went to Africa and left show biz for a break.
5,Funny as $#!T !!! Must have for any self-respecting Chappelle fan.,"Ok, stop reading reviews and just buy the darned DVD already. If you like Dave Chappelle, you simply need to add this to your collection. While not his absolutely most funniest stuff, still worth getting and still ranks a 5 for anybody that likes Chapelle."
2,Not His Best Work!,"I'am a Dave Chappelle fan but I did not find this stand-up routine all that hilarious. There were some funny moments but not nearly the amount of laughs I had from his TV show and his previous stand-up DVD Killin Them Softly.He seemed to take jokes too far in hopes that it would get funnier. They didn't. I would only encourage you to get this DVD if you are a HUGE Chappelle fan and want to see some more of his work but be prepared.I still like Dave Chappelle's comedy, but this DVD is not his best work."
2,"Unfortunately, it's not worth much.","A very disappointing performance by Chappelle. Everything that makes ""Killin' them Softly"" great is missing here. Dave doesn't seem to be enjoying himself doing standup in this show. The jokes aren't sharp, and he lacks the energy he usually exudes. There are some funny moments, but I don't know...this just falls so short of everything else he's done. I love Dave, but I think the pressure of being funny and his show really took a toll on him by this point. We'll just need to look forward to Chappelle's Show Season 3!!!"
5,Bird's eye views in a pocket,This monocular is better than or equal to my full size binoculars. Its compact and I find I carry it more often. Its i big hit with my fellow trail blazers! [...]
4,Clemente - Old School Hero,"Maraniss does a wonderful job describing the life of this dignified hero. While the portrayal of Clemente isn't always glowing, the humble greatness shines through. This is a great book for today's youth who wants to look beyond the Nike comercials for somebody to look up to. Clemente was the man."
4,"Great Story of a Man & an Athlete, When Baseball was Still Fun","A great story of a fine human being and baseball star. This book also gives you a flavor of the era that Clemente played in. A time when baseball was fun, and the players were more dedicated. This isn't a great book, but is well worth reading. If you love baseball, you'll find this a great read."
3,Not Much Traction,"I'm a huge baseball fan, and looked forward to learning more about Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente. Adding to my expectations were the author's excellent credentials, David Maraniss. But something was missing for me: Maraniss failed to construct his narrative around a major theme in Clemente's life, an underlying message, or otherwise focus the writing around something of utmost importance about the man. As a result his account skips around, involving way too many fringe characters, and doesn't add up to much in the end. An occasional story or anecdote pops up, but since the pieces and parts don't support a dominant theme, there are few insights into what made Clemente tick, what made him special, or reveal much about his legacy."
2,Used Book,I ordered a new book but recieved a used one. It was apparent by the tattered cover. It was for a birthday present but now I am stuck with a used book so I al VERY disappointed!! Barb Brown
4,Clemente Was More Than A Great Ball Player,"This is a great book for baseball fans, especially those who are becoming disenchanted with the behavior of superstars in recent years. The book is well researched, well written, and animated with more than just statistics. Gatlin Rice wrote the famous line, ""Baseball is not a game of satistics. It is Joe Dimagio rounding second."" He might well have written, ""It is Roberto Clemente sliding into third!"""
4,Buster's Farewell to Silent Films,"While Spite Marriage isn't quite up to the standards of Buster Keaton's independently produced films, it's still very, very funny indeed.Buster is a pants presser so besotted with a famous stage actress (Dorothy Sebastian), that he shows up everywhere she does just to near her (these days we'd call him a stalker!). When her leading man jilts her, she immediately marries Buster out of spite. Eventually, through numerous comic mishaps, Dorothy of course realizes she does love Buster.While the plot meanders, there are several hilarious scenes that ""make"" the picture: Buster ruining a Civil War melodrama is one, and his attempts to ouwit some modern day pirates is another. But perhaps best of all is the marvelous pantomime of Buster attempting to put a drunken Dorothy to bed. Using just two actors, a bed, a chair, and endless Keaton inspiration, Buster created a classic comedy routine."
3,Keaton's Last Silent Is Laugh - Out - Loud Funny!,"Made one year later after Keaton's masterpiece ""The Cameraman"". ""Spite Marriage"" shows Keaton to be in top comedic form! Keaton plays Elmer a poor little tailor who's in love with stage actress Trilby Drew (Dorothy Sebastian)and she's in love with the leading man in a play she's in, Lionel Benmore (Edward Earle). Once Drew finds out that Benmore is about to marry another woman, she gets ouraged, and out of SPITE decides to marry Elmer. There's one hilarious scene after another. Some parts of the film may remind some of other Keaton classics such as ""Steamboat Bill,Jr."" and ""The Navigator"". This is a film all filmbuffs, Keaton fans, silent movie fans, and wannabe filmmakers should see. One of Keaton's best films!"
1,"Merton College, Oxford, Should Be Embarrassed","This is the first of Roberts' works which is somewhat weak in content. It seems repetitive and overly general. However, the real problem with this is Roberts' abominable sentence structure. Please don't think this is an academic grammarian sort of criticism. I am not one and don't mean this to be such. What I mean is that this reads as if it were written in a foreign language (probably German) and then translated literally, word for word, without any thought being given to the differences in word order used by the two languages. At best, this makes the book difficult to read. Sometimes, the reading gets quite painful. At its worst, his meaning can be almost impossible to discern."
1,Seattle reviewer and the facts,"While I am happy the anonymous reviewer from Seattle enjoyed this book, he misstates the facts. He claimed my review had ""unfounded claims of inaccuracy"" I offer the following rebuttal: 1. On page 858 of the First American (Viking) Hardcover edition is found the following statement: ""1969 16-21 July: Apollo 11 (USA) lands three men on the moon, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin Aldrin."" This is still wrong- only Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon.2. Page 901: ""Truman, President H. F."" This is not the name of our former President.3. Anonymous in Seattle is welcome to his opinion about Roberts' coverage of the internet, but I still think he largely misses the point of the impact on the World, even if it has only majorly impacted major populations in the first world nations so far.While I have enjoyed many of J. M. Roberts books. This was a sloppy effort and not worth most readers time or money. In addition the quality of the printing of my copy was terrible."
3,A Historical All-in-One Pill of the Last Century,"If you have a bent toward government, politics and power then Twentiety Century: History of the World, 1900- to the 2000 is the name of the game for you. It's good but I can only take so much pure history. To ring in the new year, I experimented with two books. The second was LIFE WITH NOAH. I recommend that less known book as a reading choice to escape the dusty political history of our civilization. It provides a perspective people need today. It is grounded. A solid narrative with a story line that transports one back to the early days of the 1900s when it was still possible to escape (a little easier) humanity. There in the wilds of the Cold RIver valley of the Adirondack mountains I experienced the joy living in nature can bring. This warm book could be a movie. What a treat."
2,"no info, cheaper/better ones out there","at first i thought this a great price. then did a google search on pocket and dirt bikes. easily found three sites with bikes at same price, including shipping. but one site stood out (lg wholesale) who ahd much the same bike at 525including shipping, AND it was a honda clone with back end support. and they gave LOTS of info on the specs. the amazon site was lacking on such info and on any support, parts etc...buying this from amazon would be a pig in a poke, with possible problems wit service and parts. and with dirt bikes that is SURE to happen. i will go with the hinda clone at the lower price."
2,Not in the same league with 'Rebecca',"""starcloud 99"": you were _not_ the only reader who did not enjoy this, in my opinion, highly overrated book. I too found the comparison to 'Rebecca' completely misleading. I'm also in profound disagreement with an editorial reviewer who described this book as ""ruthlessly funny."" Rather than finding the book funny, I thought it was relentlessly downbeat, featuring a cast of characters who, for the most part, live pathetically pointless lives. I was unable to connect to any of the characters, leaving me frustrated and unmoved by the story's end. The cleverest thing about the book was the way the author inexorably brought together the seemingly unrelated characters. Unfortunately, by the book's end, I didn't find this clever device to be sufficient compensation for having spent all that time learning about a mostly disagreeable cast of characters. This book left me disappointed and vaguely depressed."
3,The Worst Kind of Boyfriend,"This is not the same quality of novel as Eva Moves the Furniture. The characters are bit shallow and therefore hard to really like. As I got further into the novel I did learn a little more about the characters intentions, but not much.If you've ever seen the movie Cherish with Robin Tunney you'll have a feeling of this book."
1,This was a national best seller ?????,I can't believe that this book was a national best seller. It was a piece of trash . I bought the book on another website and was glad I only paid a $1.29 for it . Won't be selecting a book by this Author again anytime soon .
1,missing world and missing a lot more...,"I found this book very dull and ordinary...nothing special. I did'nt even like the characters, they were boring and I felt very distant from them.This scenario had so much potential... a car accident, loss of memory, en ex-boyfriend...but unfortunatly the plot just did'nt thicken... I can't even say it was predictable because there was'nt much going on. Too many details of unimportant events and tiresome people and not enough intrigue or mystery for it to be a page turner. I had a hard time even reading it to the end.I found the cover design and the synopsis to be more fascinating than the story itself therefore I give it one star (*).I can't honestly recommend this book."
2,WHAT DID I JUST READ?,"I loved the fact that the author used so many character traits to make the story interesting. Other than that though, I found this book to have no real plot. Hazel moves back in with Jonathan, and then.... nada! For hundreds of pages, useless events keep occurring. The end was ridiculous, too. I couldn't tell if Livesey was trying to end things on a positive note or on a crazy note. If anyone knows, feel free to email me with the answer. Berryjess@hotmail.com"
1,Awful,"I loathed this book. I thought the characters were one dimensional and the plot was predictable. The writing was adequate, but in a genre loaded with great writers, adequate is inadequate."
2,The Missing World,"Am I the only one who didn't like this novel?My friends and I had all recently read ""Rebecca"" somewhat together, and were looking for another novel for our book ""club"". When we found this one and saw that on the front cover it said ""a modern day 'Rebecca'"", we immediately bought it.I was severely dissapointed. The writing is well rounded, but it just did not hold my attention. I went through about 71 pages and I just couldn't read any more. The story bounced around between 6 or so different characters, and I just couldn't keep track of them all.It turned out my friends had the same opinion I did. None of us got through Chapter 6. I'm glad others enjoyed it. *S*"
2,Transparent,This case did not look transparent in the picture. Neither did the ad state that it was. It does not look so good over my pink RAZR. Very disappointed.
3,the best for now,"ok, this is the only greatest hits of the great pj proby on the market right now so you should buy it, but, the soundquality isn't the best, no remastered songs here, don't get me wrong, it's still good, but when you turn up volume it ain't like the vinyl, and why is not niky hoeky on the album? conclusion: its good for now, but a proper greatest hits with good sound must be released. emi? what are you doing?"
5,"P.J.Proby - ""The Living Legend""",Now it is a new Millenium and P.J.Proby is still giving performances.He stills sings his greatest songs and confirmsthat he is still one of the greatest singer - ever !
4,Excellent Resource,"This book was was a great resoucre. With her past, she seems to understand how people in these situations feel and think. I could definitely identify with her! Sometimes people dealing with affairs need support from someone who understands, instead of intellectual babbling from so called experts. I would recommend this book to anyone who is having ""affair"" problems right now."
3,"works, but tends to float","pros: price, medium sized air bubbles are produced, you can add (daisy chain) additional air stones, and for those with smaller air pumps, the pressure required is not too high.cons: you must anchor this product somehow (rock on top, strategically placed, for example), because when you pump air into it, the whole thing wants to float.A good product if you can keep it from floating to the top."
4,Costco Price is Better,Check the 2-pack deal out at Costco instead. The price is lower and you can pick them up same day in any Costco warehouse.
2,Thorough but unsatisfying,Tons of footage from the attack and propaganda from the period but ultimately unfulfilling. Felt like a very long slide strip from elementary school.
5,Expect Great Things,"This is the second least-used item in my All Clad cookware. I find myself reaching for a saucier when I could use this pot. My advice is not to get a saucier in a similar size.When I have used this pot, it lives up to the All Clad reputation -- heavy for its size and heats well. Angled sides really speed evaporation.There was once a version of this pan that had markings on the inside that so you could see when you've reduced the contents by half or whatever. That was a novel idea, but it seems that version has been discontinued.Dishwasher safe is always a plus. Stay-handle is nice as well."
2,disappointed,"I'm sorry but I'm quite disappointed with this movie. I gave it 2 stars because it did follow the book closely. I do not like the acting in this movie at all. Besides the poor quality of the movie, there is absolutely no chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. I have no idea how Jane and Mr. Rochester could fall in love with one another in this movie. They both appeared cold and distant toward each other. I felt like I was watching a bad soap opera and this version is way too pricey compare to the other much better versions of Jane Eyre available out there."
4,The second best adaptation,"I watched every Jane Eyre adaptation. T. Dalton's is my favorite. I can't take my eyes of him. It is not just look, but certain magnetism and he plays character very true to the book. Mr. Rochestor suppose to be phisically strong, dark, moody. St. John's actor is also handsome, but he leaves me cold.M. Jayston's performance is very talented, but he looks old and frail. His Jane doesn't have to be afraid of him even when he is mad. She is quite a big woman, more musculane than him.I don't enjoy looking at M. Jayston (sorry his fans, but that is the world of entertainment).I think Clarke is better for the role of Jane. This Jane I can hardly call ""pet lamb"". Also she is too warm, outgoing, cries too often. Jane should be quite and reserved as a little nun.Mr. Mason supposed to be a handsome man. He is handsome in 1983 series, but not in this one.I also get annoyed by narrating.Somehow I just like everybody and everything in 1983 better."
2,"Jane Eyre, BBC 1973","I purchased this version of Jane Eyre based partially on reviews that I read saying how wonderful it was. Despite all the glowing praise, I found this version dry as dust. I much prefer the Masterpiece Theatre (2006) version."
1,Unwatchable,"""Prepare yourself for something dreadful"" (Elizabeth Bennet). In this production the lead roles are so miscast that within seconds they crush irredeemably the hopes of even the most indulgent JANE EYRE devotee."
5,Nice,"Very good rendition, but the ending is very disappointing. Oh well, have about 4 different versions and my other favorite is the one with Timothy Dalton. A shame that you can't have one that captures the book as entirely as it should."
4,foundation trilogy ..........unanswered questions,"Like other readers I thoroughly enjoyed the foundation trilogy, but had the same feeling that I experienced when reading Sherlock Holmes for the first time i.e. that his deductive conclusions were questionable to say the least.. Examples of this are...... 1. why would the population of Anacreon treat nuclear technology with awe and subsequent religeos reverance whilst retaining space travel and advanced weapons..? 2. physchohistory is supposed to only deal with planetary masses but without the actions of mallow and hardin would the result have been the same , particulally as they appeared to have been the only ones to see the solution. ?. our own world's history is litterd with individuals who have altered the destiny of world history ,napoleon, hitler alexander etc. Despite these faults it still a ripping read! not so the sequels /prequels. Asimov should have left his masterpiece alone. thank god conan doyle cannot ruin sherlock holmes !!"
1,"Terrible monitor, horrible service & tech support","This monitor worked correctly for about a month. After that it began displaying incorrect colors and odd patterns. After returning it to Sceptre in CA twice it still does not work properly. Sceptre Customer Service and Technical Support are extremely incompetent, disorganized and rude.We would never purchase a Sceptre product again. Spend a few extra dollars to get a better name brand."
3,"Great monitors, but.....","I have two of these monitors. They're great.... until I had a power outage. Then they won't come back on. I have to play with the power plug on one for about twenty minutes (not a short, just plugging it in, checking to see if it's back on, and unplugging it if it isn't) and the other I've already had to send back for repair for this problem once. It came back, we had a power outage and... yep, no workie. I haven't heard many other bad reviews, may this be the only one."
1,Monitor died immediately after warranty expired.,"The display initially looked decent, but the power supply died immediately after the one-year warranty expired. Really cheap components. I would avoid this LCD if you're looking for lasting quality."
5,The Rest of the Best,"Along with ""Best Ghost Stories of LeFanu"",also published by Dover, this completes the set of LeFanu's short stories. Although these stories tend to be a bit longer than masterworks like ""Green Tea"", they are every bit as worthwhile and are musts for any fan of English-Irish ghost stories. These two volumes comprise multiple collections of LeFanu's work originally published under the titles ""Madame Crowl's Ghost"" ""In A Glass Darkly"", ""Golden Friars"" and several previously uncollected stories. Le Fanu is right behind M.R James and right in front of E.F Benson in the ghost story writing business."
3,IT'S EASY!,"Although I admire Stafford's political actions and views, I do not admire his smug, self-satisfied attitude toward ""the writing life."" Not all of us can squirrel ourselves away for hours every day to create, while others (women) handle life's chores. He seems also a little too self-congratulating when describing the ways in which he manipulates his students by acting (his word) as a humble class participant.His explication of some of his poems is informative. His decision not to self-edit but let an editor handle that is intriguing. But on the whole I found the tone of the book off-putting."
3,"Nice , but too heavy","I bought this pitcher in 2010. It has a nice quality, but it's too heavy, especially with juice inside. The Ice container is useless, and if ice has melted little bit and you pouring the drink, this water from melted ice also can come out to your glass.Also, it drips a lot when pouring the drink. The top cover(lid) is OK, it doesn't cover completely and doesn't lock pouring channel at all.Overall it's an OK pitcher, but I would not buy it again."
5,Eureka!,Best cocktail onions you will ever encounter. Large. Not too salty. Not too vinegary. Eensy amount of perfect sweetness. Nice big jar. Fast delivery. Buy 2 or 3 - you'll want to gift a couple to your favorite watering holes. Write your name on them.
4,A bit sweet but huge and delicious anyway,"These onions are HUGE -- 23 to 25mm diameter -- almost an INCH. They are delicious and crack like a fresh vegetable when you chew into them. The vinegar is a bit too sweet for me, so I poured out half of it from the jar and filled the jar back up with plain white vinegar. This made the onions perfect. I haven't met a pickled onion that I didn't like but even so I'd put these close to the top of my list. I noticed that they came from Israel so I assume that everyone in Israel drinks martini's or gimlets and puts these onions into them. My only problem with these onions is that they cause me to drink too many martini's. But is that a bad thing?"
2,Soggy,How old are these onions? ... they have certainly lost their crispness.Onion Cocktail 23-25mm 32 Oz
3,Wasn't very impressed,"Sorry. I wasn't very impressed. I listened to it quite a few times, trying to get more of a feeling about it. Just didn't do it for me. I'm really surprised, taking into consideration, the legacy of the family."
5,Gospel Greats!,"I love Tramaine Hawkins's music so naturally this CD was an excellent choice. The feature song; I Never Lost My Praise, will bring you to your knees in praise! The CD's I ordered will be given as gifts and I'm sure they will be enjoyed as much as I have enjoyed listening to mine!"
3,Good,"This CD was overall good. I mainly got it for the first track, ""Excellent Lord"" and I loved that song."
5,A Woman Who Sings from her Heart,"Wonderful songs and a genuine spirit of worship. I never lost my praise, is a song recommended for every christian."
5,Killing me like none other!!!!!!,"When I first heard that Kurt Carr was going to produce Tramaine Hawkins on a live project, I could not wait for the project to be released!! Needless to say, this was one of the best artist-producer collaborations ever!!! The two songs that are wearing me out are 'I Never Lost My Praise' and 'Don't Count Me Out.' Jamie Hawkins is an excellent producer as well, proving he can hold his own mos def!!! Tramaine's voice is still just as anointed as it was in the 70's. She is one of a few artists that shows what can happen when you really know how to take care of your instrument!! This project is definitely a musical journey!!! Don't burn it, buy it! You WILL NOT be disappointed!!!!!"
5,One of the more comprehensive sources on humic substances.,"Stevenson's _Humus Chemistry_ is THE source on soil organic matter (SOM), namely humic substances. It played an instrumental role as a reference in support of my masters thesis. I would recommend the book highly to anyone taking a course and/or with a serious interest in any aspect of SOM."
1,Don't waste your money - printer doesn't work,"I purchased this Avery personal label printer to use at work. It's been nothing but a headache. The problem with it is it uses special labels, the machine is supposed to read the bar code on the back of the label. After a while, the machine doesn't read it AT ALL. No matter how many times you try to feed it in, it doesn't work, the light remains a flashing amber color which means not reading label. I am throwing this one out!"
2,It wasn't what I expected.,It's too much more detailed than I'd like to do. The preparation towards the end of life is somewhat unlike what I think should be.
5,Grant me my Final Wish,"I am a registered nurse who is presently working on my Masters in Counseling at Oakland University. I am thoroughly impressed with this journal which is intelligently and compassionately written. There should be a copy in every home. Grant Me My Final Wish will open a difficult topic for discussion, as well as leave memories for loved ones.Carol Franciosi R.N. Bsc. El. Ed. Masters in Counseling (CLASS OF '06)"
3,Great support...but...,"The support is first rate. However, after the stockings are washed, the tops tend to roll down and become too tight. I'll be going back to the below the knee style."
3,mediocre,This item is very small and does not really fit with other charms that are sold for charm bracelets. It was a nice piece but overall lacked size
1,Terrible,"I was so excited to watch this documentary. Excited to see Mumford and Sons rock the stage, make new music on the train perhaps, make new friends, get a taste of their personalities and real life. But, I put it in and became instantly disappointed. This ""documentary"" did nothing for me.. What could of been the best parts of the movie (the actual stage performances) were in SLOW MOTION! It seems as if the editor was trying to cast a shadow on the awesomeness of the bands by throwing a lot of unnecessary sepia tones and old time movie scenes in the mix. If you want to see the bands ROCK the stage and some behind the curtain scenes of REAL life, don't get this movie. You are better off saving your money and watching youtube videos.If you want to see a bunch of new friends on a train with some mediocre editing and slow motion, this is for you. MUMFORD SHOULD NEVER BE IN SLOW MOTION!"
4,Something Magical,"This film is less of a concert film or documentary than a magical journey capturing the excitement and companionship that this tour must have created for these three bands.All three of these bands are fantastic, and the director didn't try to dig deep into their souls or expose ""who they really are"". But maybe that's because we're looking at musicians who are already transparent and loving towards their fans and the world in general.My only complaint about the film itself is it could have been way longer. I am unsure as to why it's cut to a little over an hour. The deleted scenes are wonderful, and I wish they had made it into the film."
5,big easy express,Absolutely amazing inspirational piece of work. I didn't want the music to end. It brought tears of joy to me
5,Big Easy Express,"This documentary is a must-see for any fan of these extremely talented musicians. Getting to see how these bands act when they are not performing is fun and very entertaining, and the music is amazing. I highly recommend watching this film, because even if you are not a fan of these bands, you will be after watching this!"
5,So Awesome!,I was able to see this tour in New Orleans; it was just amazing. I am so excited they made this movie! I think it did a really good job of capturing the chemistry between the groups and the overall feel of the tour.
3,Eh,"It was pretty good if you like Mumford and Sons. But there's no arching story so I wouldn't call this a Documentary. It's just watching 3 bands on a train play music for an hour. Nothing wrong with that, but there's not a lot more there. It helps that it's shot amazingly though."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!","I absolutely am in LOVE with this documentary. It is absolutely fantastic, wonderful, and purely entertaining. If you love any of the bands in this, or music in general, this is a film for you. With catchy songs, and insight from the performers it put's you right in spot along the most entertaining train ride you will ever experience."
4,One song a true classic,"I'm writing this review just on the basis of one song alone - Loneman. This is truly an obscure classic if not an ahceivement in popular music, it starts off as a predictable blues/funk groove that suddenly breaks into one mother of a grunge chorus. Even then when you think you have it all down, out jumps this guitar solo that takes the song away as if it has just strapped it to a rocket ship. I haven't heard of Daniel Larson or anything about these guys apart from this album, but there are some hellacious sounds all over this disc. The only problem I have is with the sound quality, the mix tends to sound a bit muddy in places with the vocals pushed too far back. Overall there is a good variety of moods here, but in my opinion Loneman is the standout by far and something I wish I'd heard more of through the album."
1,A Disappointing Read,"I've read many Bethany House novels and enjoyed them all, but I found this book to fall way below my expectations. The plot seemed interesting at first, but it soon became clear that Marian Wells, though well-meaning she may be in regards to portraying ""Mormons"" accurately, falls well short of the mark. The information she claims to be well-researched is not. The book seems to be about 40% plot, 5% truth, and 55% speculation. Sadly, many people will take her conjecture as truth.Rather than a good Christian novel, as I have come to expect from Bethany House Publishers, this novel was used as a platform for tearing down the Mormon Church by providing misinformation, half-truths, and out-and-out lies. I've come to expect more of Bethany House. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Not what I expected,"It's more of a book on the history of the author and her family, not on Key West. Should be described as a biography. A few good old pictures of Key West but again mainly pictures of the author and her family."
1,?,"""The inscription on the Spode Judaica Mezuzah Case reads Shalom which means Peace to those who enter the home.""Ah, no. The Shin is the first letter of one of G-d's names. It might say Shalom inside, under, around back or on the box but it doesn't say so on the item in the picture.Thanks for trying though..."
3,Not quite up to snuff with the rest of the Bone series,"Although this prequel to the 'Bone' series isn't quite up to the storytelling standard fans are accustomed to, it still is a recommended read of sorts for the die-hard fan interested in the backstory of Jeff Smith's fantasy epic. The first 3/4's of this book, ""The Adventures of Big Johnson Bone, Frontier Hero,"" delves into the story of the founder of Boneville and how he came to establish his trading post on the Rolling Bone river. Drawn by Jeff Smith, this story looks great but suffers in pacing and tone as it is written by Tom Sniegoski. The last 1/4 of the book deals with a young pig and other assorted forest animals in, 'Riblet,' a very forgettable segment that most readers could easily do without."
2,disappointing,"I expected so much more from this - it was a really big letdown. I love the rat creatures, but this comic wasn't drawn nearly as well and the quick wit I've come to expect from the Bone series was replaced by something much more dull and predictable. If you love the series, don't get this book."
3,Partially Disappointed,"I wish you could rate each story rather than the book as a whole. That said, the first story that Jeff Smith illustrated was excellent. It was witty, had roots with the main bone comic books, and very enjoyable. However, the second story was horrid. I have never read a comic that was so god awful! I honestly felt like my IQ had dropped about 10 points just by reading the dang thing.I would NOT recommend buying this book because of the second story. It pains me to say that too, because the first story is really good, but not good enough to fork out 15 bucks for a few pages."
4,Training for life.,"The book is interesting, good advice and easy to follow the instructions. I have been regularly going to the gym since I was 17 years old, now I am 79 and with an estimated age between 71 to 73. The exercises and texts in this book have been in my routine, plus some advice from Reail Age page many years ago.I would recommend its reading for starters and gym participants. It has interesting information on how to evaluate your age in the successive steps on the road to a healthy body and mind."
4,its a ok book,"the book is ok ,i would like a easier getting started book ...if it was a starter book ..and then it would be easier to use"
2,keeping it simple,When I bought this book I was looking to keep it simple. That's not what I found here.
1,"Second verse, same song -","A nice book, heavy covers, good pages. Too bad the info is the same 'ole, same 'ole -I've heard before. I don't know what I was looking for, but this was not it. Maybe something to build a little motivation?? A little more humor?? This one went to Hastings buy back for a double credit."
4,An interesting addition to the Baby Sitters Club series.,"In ""Jessi and the Dance School Phantom"", Jessi is absolutely excited when she wins the lead role of Princess Aurora in her dance school's upcoming production of 'The Sleeping Beauty'. But then, Jessi starts getting threatening messages. Her ballet toe shoes are stolen. Her leotards are stolen. She keeps getting dirty looks from her classmates and they keep bumping into her and making her look bad in front of their teacher, Mme Noelle. The Baby-Sitters try to help Jessi find out who this mysterious phantom is and why she wants Jessi out of the show. Meanwhile, the Baby-Sitters are planning a big Pet show for the children of Stoneybrook, and a lot of other chaotic things start happening. It's a good book for those who like mysteries. I enjoyed it a lot."
5,Love These Pieces,"Sibelius's first two symphonies are not regarded as being his best but I personally love the first symphony. I wrote a research paper for a music history course relating Symphony 1 and 7. I used this score to analyze the first symphony and enjoyed working with this version of the score. However, I can't find any other version of the score and I would've liked to have found a pocket-sized version of the first symphony only so it would have been cheaper."
3,Cheap and missing hardware,"Hardware was missing from one box. But since it was so chintzy, maybe this was a blessing in disguise. Washer, rubber bushings and the threaded shaft were all smaller than the OEM on my Chevrolet Avalanche."
5,Awesome shocks,I replaced some ProComp 1000s after 2 months. These are great shocks. Even better with the Buy 3 get 1 free rebate.
4,Monroe Reflex Front Shocks - 2002 Avalanche,"Good product at a good price. Very easy to install. Highly recommended. I got 140,000 miles from the OEM shocks, and my ride had become very bouncy. The new Monroe Reflex shocks make it fell like a new truck. I have about 1,000 miles on them so far and have no compliants. I just hope these last as long as the OEM.-2002 Avalanche Z71-"
5,Excellent Jazz,"I first became acquainted with Carl Saunders when I purchased the Phil Urso collaboration and again am extremely pleased with this music. It is genuine swinging jazz. The Mancini selections are all choice and treated with obvious respect by Saunders and Woods. The rhythm section of Jeff Jenkins, Ken Walker and Paul Romaine keep the whole thing tied together in a neat package. But, Carl Saunders is the star on this CD. He obviously is an exceptional musician and can flat out play the trumpet as well as anyone I've ever heard including Clifford Brown. Phil Woods as usual is solid. Ken Walker's bass lines pay homage to Rolly Bundock and I thank him for that. Excellent CD."
1,Read this before buying,"I purchased these shoes because of the reasonable price as compared to Nurse Mates, and I believed the Cherokee brand to be well made. Unfortunately Cherokee shoes are not well made. After only 3 weeks of wearing (12 hour shifts, Med/Surg), the material in one of the heels disintergrated. The heels on these shoes are not solid, they are HOLLOW! So if you stay on your feet as I do, buy another brand shoe. These will not last!"
2,Okay,The shoes look great but after one day I haven't been able to wear them since. The upper part of the shoe rubs so I am trying a shoe stretcher to see if that will help. Other than the shoes rubbing they are really comfortable and hope to wear them again soon.
3,Professional looking but hard on the toes,These shoes look very nice and professional. I have trouble with my knees from being an athlete as a teenager and they provide enough support that my knees do not hurt while wearing them. The major problem I have with these shoes is that they put my toes in a position that just is not comfortable. They have a slight heal which makes my toe slide down and push against the bottom of the shoe. My toes were beginning to swell up and turn red. I do wear arch supports in my shoes so this may have also been a factor. I had to get toe wedges from the good feet store to put under my good feet cushions. This keeps my toes from hurting and being pushed down into the shoe. So far the shoes are fine with the toe wedges in them.
3,Eh,"Apparently I am the only one that knows that this is a compilation of tracks not released until now. He says it's his 3rd album because it was originally suppossed to be. Anyone ever hear of Cormega's Testament? Yeah,almost the same situation. CDs ok but if you're a real Canibus fan,which reading the reviews,most are not,you'd notice his style on the album is too similar to the 'ok' albums Can-I-Bus and 2000 B.C. Which shows this album is anything but new. He had it on sale on his websites about 2 years or so ago.The beats are nothing better than average and the only real thing that holds the album up is Canibus tearing lyrics apart while sounding like he doesn't even have to try. Decent album but way to short considering the price and rarity. Disappointed but a must have for anyone who hadn't already owned the album and is a Canibus fan. Rip the Jacker is still easily the best one thus far with Virtuvian man trailing a close second."
3,another average album by a master emcee,"Even though most of his albums are sub-par beats and production wise and theme wise, Canibus is still a mad tight emcee. It's just his direction. Its way off. He would do well to hook up with a tight producer, even a mainstream one. If he stays true to his lyrical skill he can never sell out. His themes are okay, they have never really been that great, but they allright. His lyricaL flow is sometimes amazing, sometimes so-so. Its always hit or miss with this guy. But I like this album better than hip hop for sale. I would still recommend any canibus album to rock at least a few times. His is an ill rapper who gets no credit or respect. He is hell bent on ripping emcees and being angry, and that's cool, but he needs more. I think his flows about weed and woman are weak, and sometimes he ego trips. Mind control is still pretty tight. The tightest track are: 33 3's,Gybaotic,Mind control, Last laugh, the rest are all right, some are forgetable."
4,Its nice,"This album I was waiting a while for it to come out and its nice, glad to see he's still around doing his thing and he will get his credit for it soon."
1,Flee Market Rejects,"This cabinet came in two flat boxes of sawdust, broken pieces of wood, cut particleboard and cardboard. The poorest quality cabinet I have ever seen and I have been to Wal-Mart once or twice. This is supposed to be a DVD ""safe"" safe? The cabinet was pressed sawdust with a cardboard backing nailed on. No where in the description does Spinkeeper tell you what materials are used to fabricate this cabinet. This cabinet is incredibly overpriced for pressed sawdust and cardboard along with a handful of nails and screws. Save your money and buy a real wood or metal cabinet. My unit is on its way back."
3,Abridged version,This book is not the original autobiography - it's the abridged version and entire chapters have been removed or rewritten with a one page summary.It's not the same as reading Major Taylor's words.
4,Great Gift,"I got this as a gift a few years ago and loved it so much I bought it for my niece. While the brushes aren't my absolute favorite, my horse loves the curry and I love the main and tail brush. They're easy to throw in the trailer because of the carry bag. I think it's a great starter kit for any horse owner."
5,Very inspiring,This is an awesome book. It has inspired me to paint on-site more and has given me some invaluable additions to my palette. His style is attractive to me because it's more masculine and similar to my own. His narrative is very inspirational and instructive. Reading it and viewing his work will get you out painting every time.
4,Things to Come--but all the same book,"The point of this review is that any version of Things to Come, at least from 1958 to 1980, the version in front of me, is the same text reprinted.Hey, you wouldn't be looking for ""Things to Come"" if you didn't like it. This is 633 detailed pages discussing Biblical prophecy by topic and in detail from those positions which J Dwight Pentecost has come to represent. Yes, this was his doctoral research when he was just starting out, turned into a book and still selling more than 50 years later (as he is also still teaching, as I write!)"
1,just a light diversion,"I went through this book in a couple of hours. By the second half of the book I was basically skimming the pages to see if the plot had any interesting aspects to it. The characters are two-dimensional, maybe even one-dimensional, stereotypes. Often you read a review of a book that claims the text could be reduced by 30-40% and make a better read. This book would have been better if it had more text, especially character development. There was no sense of anticipation or wondering what would happen to the hero. The hero gets in a jam and, within two pages at most, everything is quickly resolved. Everything happened so fast it seemed like the author was in a hurry to get finished with it. This book could be used for a great TV series, as long as the series wasn't longer than one hour, as it had lots of action and nothing to engage the brain. A real disappointment."
4,An excellent reference,This comes in handy sometimes in my current job. There are a few things I wish it had that it does not (like world rank equivelents) but you can't have everything.
4,Yorkshire Tea (Red label),"Ahhhhh, a fine cuppa. Yorkshire Tea is one of the best sellers in the UK, and it makes a very fine cup of ea. I wouldn't be without it, and will be ordering more as time goes on. Plus, Amazon (and it's suppliers) are very reasonably priced."
5,Love This Tea!!!,We love this tea. My husbands family is from England and they got us hooked on this tea.
1,Stale,"I just love Yorkshire Tea and I ordered this 5-pack. Unfortunately, when I made a cup of tea, I was very disappointed! It was stale. I tried another box. Same deal. I don't know why - maybe it was poorly stored? Supposedly I'm getting a refund. I'm wishing for a good cup of tea!"
5,Wonderful book,"My 4 year old loved this book. It's just the right blend of story, science/identification of dinosaurs and has great illustrations. We read it twice in a row."
2,"Dull, Dry and Dated","Even though the authors periodically ""update"" their crappy text, there's nothing new, it's still painfully, desperately dull and all the ""as I see its"" are generally unique to one, large resort property. And all the studies supporting his cases are either painfully dated (like 1985-1990), supporting companies now out of business (or practices largely abandoned) OR an issue is presented, the corrective steps presented and they we're never told what the actual results were.I both taught hospitality management and (unlike many other instructors) have extensive professional hotel experience. This book offers nothing beneficial---it's boring to read, with really not a lot of stuff to learn from, just endless droning."
3,A strange little book,".....lots of information here, esoteric stuff, & about the Masons, origins of the Iluminati, and also anti-semetic! Read with scepticism! but very interesting...."
5,"On outstanding, engaging book...","I really enjoyed this book written by my ex-professor. This is a marvelous psychohistorical, highly engaging, and at times pleasantly shocking reading about one Patrick Pearse. Moran goes deeply into the Pearse's psyche and explores the possible reasons for Patrick's (i)-rational actions. Was he a suitable hero-figure or was he a man driven by circumstances, his perception of injustice, and his powerlessness."
2,100 Pages of Limited Value,"Why spend twenty dollars on this book with 100 pages of limited information when you can buy one of Alan Weiss' terrific books on consulting such as The Million Dollar Consultant? Not sure how much experience the other reviewers have of either consulting or consulting books, but this is certainly not one of the leading books available on Amazon.com or anywhere else for that matter. Do yourself a favor and spend the twenty bucks elsewhere. In fact, on Amazon's marketplace, you can buy 2 or 3 preowned books for the price of this one alone."
3,not my thing,"I was disappointed with these dried fruits, which are, well, dry and a bit too chewy, but perhaps that's how they're supposed to taste. I just wasn't expecting the type of consistency. My toddler, however, enjoys nibbling on these sometimes. This is a huge purchase (lots of bags), so please be sure you like it before you place an order."
1,I'm sorry to go against the consensus opinion,"But I must. Maybe it is a personal bias, but I can't stand sensationalism with no redeeming qualities. Everything said in this book has been said many times before (see the ""related works"" on this very page), but the authors find a way to muddle things up in a very negative way. Aims at the lowest instincts of man. Of course, this is the modus operandi of the author which becomes clear if you consider his other works.Avoid."
1,"Washed this new glass, now bleeding -- don't buy!","I was excited about the looks of this glass. My set of four came in the mail less than a week ago, now three of them are in the garbage. One almost sliced my lip. I thought that was a fluke and didn't worry about it too much. Then a second one had a damaged and sharp edge. Now I just washed the third of four and cut my hand. These are elegant looking glasses that are actually very cheaply made and a bit dangerous. I would never ever buy them again. I would give zero stars, if it were possible."
5,It took me back to a place I love,"The photos and text of this book are truly amazing. As soon as I opened the book, it was as if I were back in Haiti once again. Smelling the smells, hearing the sounds, seeing the sights.A wonderful gift for someone who has been to Haiti and was touched by the beauty and simplicity of a country so close to the U.S. in proximity and so far away in reality."
4,Opera lite,"I am not a huge fan of opera music. Most of it gets on my nerves but I do like it when opera music is mixed in with a smidgeon of pop music. Amici Forever may not create opera music that is pure but their music is nice to listen to when I just want to unwind after a long day at the office. THE OPERA BAND is the group's first album. I heard about it through a television commercial a few years ago and bought a copy. I like the combination of male and female singers. While the song selection is rather predictable (because they have been covered by other artists in the classical/crossover genre), I thought the group did a good job. I particularly enjoyed their version of ""Unchained Melody"" and Elgar's ""Nimrod"". The music is a bit bland and the group offers nothing new that I haven't heard before in the classical/crossover genre, I still enjoy listening to their music. Their fusion of pop and opera helps take off the edge from the dark, heavy music I normally listen to on a regular basis/"
3,Easy Listening,"Bought the album after hearing someone talk about the group. Thought the voices were okay (baritone was the best) but in some songs didn't blend properly. Selection of pieces was interesting . . . pop, classical, opera. Good album for ""background"" music."
5,Amici forever are a breath of fresh air,Having got their debut CD and now read the remarks on the Review section I am horrified that so many of you do not appreciate this 'breath of fresh air'in the classical crossover phenomenon. Amici forever are a delight in every sense. Their music capabilities are beyond reproach and their glorious harmonies are simply fantastic. There is not another sound quite like it. They have taken classical crossover and given it 'credibility' and taken it to another dimension. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. Ignore the rest....buy this album....you will not regret it! All success to the five of you. You richly deserve it and many thanks for your talent.
1,Comment,"Some reviewer wrote:'Amici (Italian, pronounced ""A-mee-chi""; the ""ch"" is like in the English word ""chocolate"") and means ""friends."" Come to think of it, their names translates to ""Friends Forever."" 'Well, Duh....thanks for the astute glimpse into the obvious."
4,"PRACTICALLY A ""5""","In spite of those smug little classical twits who scoff and redicule The Opera Band for its mediocrity and redundancy, there exists a world of us who not only enjoy but appreciate their talent and this CD in particular."
5,Opera for the masses,"I fell in love with The Opera Band CD when I first heard it, but feel even stonger after hearing them in concert in Tampa. This young group merges classic opera with the Righteous Brothers Unchained Melody and songs in between. They bring opera to the masses! Don't miss this. It's great listening music, background music, dancing music - cranked way up, its great music to cook by ... or for that matter anything else you have in mind - Bolero be damned!"
2,"Passionless, contrived, mediocre.","This says it all. It's not an album I will listen to very often and there's nothing compelling about any of the cuts. I love ""Canto Alla Vita"" by Josh Groban; this rendition is decidely lukewarm. The Pavane by Faure is more sleepy than hypnotic. ""Unchained Melody"" makes you wish for a scissor with which to cut the cord. Frankly, there is better popera to be had from the likes of Bocelli, Safina, Frangoulis, Watson, and Groban. This is formula music designed for the mass market. Not worth the purchase."
3,Enjoyed It for what it is,"Those people that say that they are dumbing down opera with this Cd do not really know what kind of music this cd is.I do not understand why this Cd is called The opera Band when this Cd does that really have much opera on it.I gave the Cd 3 stars because the cd could be better .The songs I really like on this Cd are Vita Mia,Whisper Of Angels,and Requiem for a Soldier."
1,OK - but not great,"OK. Frankly, I'm dissappointed. These people are supposed to be classically trained? Shame on their teachers. The amount of slurping that goes on is just plain bad! Don't they know how to hit a note on the note?? And, why are they out of tune? Every once in a while there's a sour note. They also don't blend well. And, I can't understand the Italian at all.Now, if you're a newcomer to Opera, do yourself a big favor and pass over the glitz of ""rock-and-roll"" opera and buy yourself a CD by Rene Fleming."
1,Frequently Returned,"THis product is listed as ""Frequently purchased with"" a second generation iPod shuffle (the one that looks like a large postage stamp). However, the product itself is NOT COMPATIBLE with the second gen shuffle. It is built specifically for the third generation shuffle (the one that looks like a small pack of chewing gum).The product description itself is vague and should be clarified."
1,Gag me!,This CD is just too cheesy. I can't believe I actually paid for it. I'd return it if I could.
4,Nice,"This bread box is huge. Can fit a lot of items. Helps to keep my counter clean. The look of it is nice, modern in a vintage way. Did buy some rubber feet at the hardware store to keep it from sliding all around."
3,"Good size, but not heavy enough and I don't recommend the white","I looked a LONG time through the various breadboxes and decided on this one because of size and the nice looking exterior. The size is pretty great. I can fit one long loaf of bread and one smaller one and I still have a little room left over. But I'm very disappointed looks-wise which is why I'm rating it 3 stars.That thick rim on the bottom? It's plastic and cream colored. The whole thing is more cream than bright white, but the plastic color doesn't match the the body well and makes it look far cheaper than it cost. It's also VERY light, like a cheap mailbox. So I'm putting it in my pantry closet and bought a wesco to sit on the counter for bagels and opened crackers etc. I'm hoping that'll be heavier and less likely to slide around or land on the floor (my household has boys that are always in a big hurry.)"
3,"Yes, they sang ""Heart and Soul""","T'Pau - in America at least, was a one hit wonder in 1987 with the song, ""Heart and Soul."" I loved it! Still do. Additionally, the song, ""China is Your Hand"" is great. In my opinion, these are the two stand-out songs on the cd."
5,THE DEBONNAIR FRENCH ROMANTIC,"Even president POMPIDOU was a fan of JACQUES DUTRONC back in the sixties, which tells a lot about his impact then. JACQUES later became a respected movie actor(VAN GOGH),and his ironic face coupled with a relaxed way of taking life not to seriously made him quite irresistible with women.This 2cd collection is perfect in every aspect, giving full credit to JACQUES LANZMANN his first lyric writer.ET MOI,ET MOI,ET MOI and IL EST CINQ HEURES, PARIS S'EVEILLE have become classics and are delightfully ironic.If you don't know it,JACQUES is also FRANCOISE HARDY's husband."
5,Just wonderful!!,Perfect size and adorable pose sitting on an ornate pedestal and the iron part fits perfectly under the grate we bought to hold the logs. We use our fireplace everyday in the winter and these are just beautiful. Plus their eyes glow brightly when the fire is lit and flickering behind the kitties. I love these and would strongly recommend them to anyone who loves cats and fireplaces. Just wonderful!
5,Great product,"Love my kittys. First set broken in transport and they were replaced by you immediately, no hassle. Love your company"
3,"Warm, charming ideas for thoughtful, inspirational gifts","This is a charming little book, with numerous handwritten ideas for ways to inspire and motivate one's friends, loved ones, and acquaintances. It includes several tempting recipes, and a number of affirmations and suggestions toward strengthening one's relationships, enriching other lives, helping those in need, et cetera. Although none of the ideas or passages were new to me, they reportedly prove very helpful at the author's workshops -- and, just because I was already familiar with them doesn't mean that everyone is.However, be forewarned that it is very Christian in nature. That certainly isn't a criticism (I, too, am Christian -- and proud of it). My point is that this would obviously be an inappropriate gift for people of other faiths."
5,Good,Book seems like it will be really helpful before law school starts. It arrived on time and in promised condition.
5,A valuable resource for law students and the general public!,"As a member of the law school community, I understand the importance of providing students with comprehensive yet concise reference guides. American Legal Systems is the perfect resource for anyone interested in an overview of American legal institutions. This book is unique in that it's reader-friendly, explicit and thorough. Professor Fine did a commendable job in presenting complicated issues in a comprehensible fashion. I highly recommend her book!"
2,Not Thrilled...,The fog resistance of this spray is pretty poor. I have been using it for about 10 swims now and I've had plenty of time to judge. I swim 2000 meters at a time and this does not maintain fog resistance for the entire workout. Look for a different product...
4,Good,"This suff is Ok but it takes a little while to apply it to get clear vision and keep the antifog on, it does clean very nicely and when you do get the antifog just right, it works perfectly...for one game, yes, you have to apply it before every game. The 2oz is enough, no need for the 8oz one. I give this 4.5 stars"
4,Better-than-average Crichton,"This book is a kind of bridge between Crichton's early Hard Case Crime series and his later work. Even his early work contains elements of a technical nature, but this is a little more exotic, a few more twists and turns, while retaining that early ""whodunnit"" theme. I've read 23 of Crichton's 30 published works, and this is definitely in the upper half of his offering.This used hardback arrived promply and in good condition. Very satisfied."
3,Miguel Garcia,Que pasa con el envio de este producto lo pedi hace tres dias y miro que todavia no lo han enviado ¿lo iran a enviar?
1,Just Do Not Buy It,"If you want a reason to buy this film, ask yourself, ""Do I want to spend $6.00 of my money on a film that is not loyal to any of the Sherlock Holmes stories?"" Certainly, this film version would never make it on any market if the names of the characters were changed. Ex: Sherlock Holmes became Bill Smith and Dr. Watson became Dr. Rogers. However, Hallmark plays upon the desire of devoted Sherlockians to purchase every Sherlock Holmes film created.For the dedicated Sherlockian, I will say that this film combines elements of (1) The Scandal in Bohemia, (2) The Bruce Partington Plans, and (3) the writers imagination after watching too much ""Law and Order."" An example of imagination is the role Mycroft Holmes plays in the film - acting as Sherlock's foil.If you want to view Sherlock Holmes films that are somewhat loyal to the original films, purchase the Jeremy Brett version of ""The Scandal in Bohemia"" and ""The Bruce Partington Plans."""
2,"not bad, but...","I agree with the first review that I felt sorry for Clare, the main character. I can't see her accepting Matt's lies (ok, not lies, more like omissions...very important omissions)so easily and just accepting him back with open arms. It needed more groveling before she should've taken him back. Not a chapter of groveling but a few more pages would be nice."
3,Enjoyable Outback Adventure,"Like this book but felt sorry for main character Clare as she had bad experiences with men. Strong male character, Matt, made me mad at times with his deceptions.Harlequin Summary:Men like Matt Sheffield don't often visit the small Outback town of Bangaratta, so when the incredibly sexy actor arrives he creates quite a stir. Particularly when he makes his attentions to the local pharmacist Clare Pride sizzlingly clear!Bitter experience has taught Clare to avoid men like Matt at all cost -he isn't offering forever, but at most a brief if unforgettable fling. At first Clare fully intends not to be his mistress. However, Matt is a master of persuasion and Clare finds herself increasingly attracted by the prospect of a secret affair...."
1,Another disaster,I thought the debut was bad but this one is far beyond bad. It will make you cringe and want to do yourself a favor by ripping your own ears off.Outdated by years.
5,Everything you need to know about gardening all year is here,"This review is for the copyright 1961 edition by J.I. Rodale, Eleventh Printing-November 1975. In this book, you will find chapters of planning the vegetable garden,starting with the soil, improving soil structure, fertilizing your soil, how to make compost, preparing the soil for planting, starting plants from seed, seeding, planting and transplanting outside, how to use mulches, summer garden care, watering and irrigating, when to harvest, fall and winter garden care, storing the surplus, controlling insects and disease, freezing and canning vegetables, marketing organic foods, growing vegetables in the greenhouse and year-round schedules of garden activity. There is also 16 chapters of fruit gardening. Index included."
3,Textbook,It's ok for a textbook. Not sure I would recommend it for pleasure reading though. It talks about different types of leadership.
3,Icy adventure and drama in high lattitudes,"Few writers cover the sea and sailing better than Peter Nichols, who conveys both emotion and accurate depictions of sailing methods and terminology. This book is the original title of 'Voyage to the North Star', and the reviews logged under that title are sufficient, so I defer to them. I can add that Nichols' 'Voyage for Madmen' is perhaps a greater read, especially when one considers that the events are real in 'Madmen', but the story no less dramatic."
4,Works Great!,"Fantastic battery life. Easy to use. The only drawback is that it is very hard to read, plus the light goes out too quickly."
5,List price,This 1GB player's list price is only 59.95. I can't believe Ace Digital charges almost twice as much. It's a good flash MP3 player that looks stylish and plays forever on one AA battery.
5,Awesome study guide!!!,Great book!!! Easy to read and understand. They use excellent examples to explain hard to understand topics. Definitely a must buy for any one trying to become a SCJP.
5,total coverage for SCJP5 exam,"i have just passed my exam with 97%. This book covers everything that you need to know for SCJP5 Exam. Once you read it you will feel confident but dont be fooled you are not finished just yet. you have to do a lot of mock exams which are available online. (for the mock exams and some help go to www.javaranch.com).The practice questions after each chapter are very important. These questions are very close to the exam questions. Solve them all before you enter the exam.I can not say the same thing about the simulated test included in CD, though you shall still go through once.Once again, this book covers 100% for SCJP5 EXAM."
4,Excellent Study Resource,This is an excellent study resource for getting ready for the SCJP exam. It's a five star binding when coupled with Head First Java.
5,SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 5 Study Guide (Exam 310-055),"Knowing and working with Java since a while the stuff is not really new to me. However I was afraid to see how many of the test questions I answered only correct in part, or simply wrong. In fact never due to missing knowledge but by falling into the pitfalls of those twisted questions or over reading hidden details in questions with apparently so obvious answers! (I had much less problems to answer the questions correctly in a competitors book from year 2000 handling the SCJP preparation for Java 1.2!)I guess this kind of training is as much as important as the mere java knowledge and I'm convinced, that those questions are able to show up smallest doubts and confusions of everybody taking the exam."
5,Excelente Libro,"Era justo lo que buscaba para la certificación es claro y te va llevando de la mano, sin omitir detalles."
2,Study guide SCJP 5,"I bought this book with a lok of expectations but found that this was certainly upto the mark. When I did my SCJP 2 - I had gone through Certification Guides from Khaled Mudgal, Jamie Jaworski, exam cram and phillip heller. I think this book has no stature against some of the names above. Threads does not mentions at single place about java.uti.concurrent package. The examples for Threads are not only boring but does not relate properly to the real world.Book is organized with the approach where each objective is taken up separately buti would certainly say that we MUST use some other certification guide apart from with this book.Regds,CP"
5,Coolest java book ever,i passed with 75%. this book is the coolest programming book i have ever read and i've been reading programming books for five years. highly reccommended.
5,Excellent Book to pass SCJP 5,"This is an excellent book to pass SCJP 5 exam. If you are a Java programmer and want to learn new features in Java 5 with certification objective in mind, go ahead and get this book.Each of the new feature is explained clearly and there are short practise sections and Two minute drills in this book which are very helpful in knowing how much we grasped after studying a chapter.I passed the exam with 79%. If you feel this is not a good percentage, it's none of this book's mistake. It's my bad that I didn't read the book fully ;-)"
5,The best SCJP book,This is a 'must read' for everyone who intent to apply for the SCJP.Worths the price.
5,Perfect,"Despite having 2 years plus experience in Java, I found the book really interesting as a good guide towards SCJP as well as a perfect source for those interested in understanding the dynamics of Java."
3,"Not a BAD book, but not my first choice","For a book based on a computer game, this is actually a decent book. But, it is not what I was hoping for. When I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I found a terrific and unexpected escape from reality. And this book touted itself as the Next Hitchhiker's Guide. It was far from that. Instead, it was a rather self-conscious immitation of Douglas Adams. It was rather flat, with few actual belly-laughs, and just one or two giggles throughout.Still, it is a light, quick read, and it is a good book for a rainy, lazy Saturday when you have nothing else to do.But read Douglas Adams first."
1,Dreadful,"Perhaps you remember the Infocom game, its delightful humor, its mystery-filled world. If you happen to see this book at a used bookstore, your fond memories of the game may deceive you into picking it up.Please, save yourself from pain and suffering.As to humor, there is none. As to juvenile and crude references, there are plenty. If this sort of thing is your cup of tea, save yourself the money and hang out on an elementary school playground during recess. This book has the distinction of being one of the two books I've actually stopped reading before the end, and I've suffered through a lot of horrid literature.At that used bookstore, I might advise you to run and run fast, but on consideration perhaps it might be best to hide it between the bookshelf and the wall to help your fellow man."
1,Worthless!,"Title says it all. Does not stop foam. It may not be possible in a running fountain, but what other kinds of fountains are there!!!"
4,The Doorman?,What a deal. It didnt work out the way I wanted it to on my project. But if you can make it work for you Great.
5,Just what I needed,"Worked perfect with my 1987 Toyota Tercel, great price and quick delivery, cant complain, great product, highly recommend.If you need one buy here!"
4,Kiss me Again,I loved this book and would recomend it to anyone who loves sizzling love stories. The stories are a perfect length!
1,Disappointed,"I do not recommend this book to anyone. All of the short stories seem beginning work that got dashed off to the printers. If you like the authors featured within this work, I firmly recommend putting this aside."
3,MORE WORK THAN I THOUGHT,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY APPLIANCE. PERSONALLY, I LOVE THE CUISINART BRAND AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED. THE ONLY COMPLAINT THAT I HAD WITH THIS PRODUCT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO STAY RIGHT NEXT TO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T OVERFLOW. I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO LIKES TO MULTI-TASK AND THIS JUST DID NOT WORK FOR ME. I JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR PATIENCE TO STAND AND WAIT FOR THE ESPRESSO TO FINISH. BUT OVER ALL THIS IS A WELL BUILT MACHINE. THE CUP WARMER WORKED GREAT, VERY HANDY HAVING A NICE WARM CUP FOR THE ESPRESSO!"
2,Beware Pod users,"This machine makes decent coffee but beware if you plan to use pods. It just doesn't work well. I have contacted manufacturer three times. They keep replacing pod filter but this isn't good enough and no one seems to care. The pod filter has many micro holes in the inside but on the outside, all the coffee is supposed to flow through one tiny hole which is impossible. The action causes the machine to disperse steam at high pressure by back flowing through drip tray. Now I know why the 4-600 dollar machines are out there."
1,Never Buy Cuisinart EM-100,"Bought this espresso maker 3 years ago. After 1-1/2 years, the steam nozzle broke off. Cuisinart sent me another unit. About another year past and the unit was building up water on the inside and dripping around the power button and steam nozzle. It was also very hot to touch on top of the unit. I was concerned that it would catch on fire. I called Cuisinart again and they sent me another unit. Now the third unit is causing me problems after 4 months. When I turn the large button in ""off"" position, the unit will continue running. Now that the 3 year warranty is gone, Cuisinart told me that they will NOT replace it. I would NOT recommend this unit."
1,Just dump the water on the counter,"Even after reading the reviews before I bought this product.I plugged it in, followed the directions and quckly had a nice steaming puddle of water on my counter.After several more tries, I put it back in the box and returned it."
2,It's not worth the money,"I have owned my Cusinart EM-100 for about a year. During that time, I have to suffer water leakage from the bottom of the machine to my counter top. A wad of paper towel is permanently wedged under the unit to soak up water. I only used the machine twice a week, so for a year, it was utilized roughly 100 times, the steam wand attached to the unit by a plastic tube broke and dropped on the counter. None of my appliances have that short life span."
3,Cuisinart Espresso Maker,Works pretty well except that I am already having issues with the power button not wanting to stay on. I am wondering if I am going to have to return it. Kind of bummed.
2,Cold espresso,"I read the book many times, i watched the DVD, i tried every possible configuration, i tried over and over and still The espresso is watered down and cold, maybe my unit is defective, thankfully i bought this from Amazon and i can simply send it back."
3,Problem with the portafilter,"The EM-100 has been working great for a couple days, then it started to leak around the portafilter when the espresso is brewing. I looked at the upper edge of the filter (side opposite to the plastic handle), there are two very tiny dents and I think the leak is coming out from there. The two dents seem to be there to serve a purpose since they seem to be properly molded (I think), but I can't understand why they are there (to lower the pressure build up??). Anyway if anyone knows why it leaks from there let me know, or if my portafilter is defective... I like this machine (e.g. milk frother is great) other than this annoying issue!"
4,Great starter espresso machine,"I've always wanted an espresso machine couldn't pass up this offer (my SIL got one too). After much reading and trial and error, I have to say I've become a pretty good barista. The DVD made it easy to understand and the espresso is turning out as expected."
2,"Good espresso, poor quality machine","The espresso is great, but I have to press down hard on the water well while it is brewing for it to work and, after about a year the milk frothing wand snapped off entirely."
3,"Easy to use, not the best frother.","Nice size, easy to use, not too noisy, but the milk frother is flimsy and uneven in force delivery into the milk. The expresso tastes good."
1,Cuisinart customer service unhelpful!,"I purchased this machine because out of my last four choices it was the only one I could pick up today and not have to order it on-line. When I got it home it was missing 2 of the three filter baskets and the 2 cleaning pins. The department store where I bought it had none left. So I called Cuisinart customer service. The representative I spoke to was very friendly and offered to send me the missing pieces. Her manager nixed that. He told me that they could waive the shipping fees, but I'd have to PURCHASE the missing pieces that should have been included and I'd already paid for when I purchased the machine. I bought a Lello Ariete 1375 instead.H Marrick"
1,Frustrating... maybe it was the shipping..,"I ordered this after reading the reviews, and never got to even use it because after unpacking it all I found one of the clips that holds the water reservoir was broken off. So... I managed to get it back in the box (no easy task), then ordered and received a replacement, and guess what?! The same exact clip was broken off this one too! So... I don't know if it's the packaging, or the manufacturing... but I would NOT recommend this item."
2,steam is better for coffee,I cannot say I am very happy with the new machine.Water pressure is not as good as steam.More cleaning.You cannot make 3 or 4 coffee at oncewater tank is not that bigIf you have steam coffee machine and you move to water think about it.
1,3 strikes - Cuisinart is OUT,"Our first machine arrived THRASHED because of poor handling by FEDEX and perhaps poor factory packaging. The first replacement machine was broken in the factory packaging (water reservoir and retaining clip for the reservoir). The second replacement was broken in the factory packaging (retaining clip).Amazon was AWESOME with their customer service and immediate replacements. But it appears that Cuisinart is using CHEAP materials and POOR packaging. After three attempts to own this machine, we rejected it."
1,Power button won't work,"The coffee machine was great when it actually worked. Made good espresso, steamed milk and I even used it to get hot water for my tea. It was loud but only for a short amount of time so it didn't bother me too much. But one month after using it the power button won't stay on. I have to return this product. Thanks to amazon's great customer service that is not a issue."
4,Cafe de Leche yummy,"The unit is a little large compared to the De Longhi unit I had that shot craps after 2 years of daily use.Compared to the De Longhi the Cuisinart unit is easier to use and requires no 15 minute warm-ups. The Stainless Steel finish and feel of the Cuisinart is nicer than the plastic finish on the DeLonghi. The output on the new unit is faster but it took several run thru's to get rid of the ""newness"" of the boiler and parts....The water reservoir is bigger and you can get more cups out of one full reservoir. The cost was about $30 higher, but so far I'm very pleased and it as worth the extra. I use Pilon yellow vacuum pack espresso grind coffee I get from AMazon and get a flavor that reminds me of Key West, FL. Cuban style coffee and milk is a nice variation on the Cappuccino/Latte obsession many of us have."
2,"Loud, Leaky Mess","I purchased the EM-100 after much research, but didn't see these two problems mentioned in any reviews that I read. It is quite loud when in use. I don't know if this is common with espresso makers because this is the first one I have ever owned, but I don't like how loud it is when you turn on the brewer. The other issue that it leaks water down into the catch tray and sometimes out of the water reservoir. Not just a little, though, quite a bit. This is a mess and is maddeningly wasteful."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"We ordered this machine, it was brand new. When it arrived, the machine was full of water! It is less than average quality. steamer is poor quality and machine was cheaply made. Save your money, our Krups is far superior!"
2,"Beware, people with standards for good espresso","I was excited to get this espresso maker because I wanted richer coffee than our old percolator could supply. Unfortunately I was met with very watery, ground-filled drizzle that was often cold. I read the instruction manual, and followed the directions to a ""T"", (heating up the cup with hot water to preserve the crema, not tamping the ground coffee down too light or too hard, etc...). What resulted was espresso that LOOKED GOOD, but tasted like watery swill. I would only recommend this product to people who don't know what good espresso is."
2,Espresso Maker,"Very disappointed at this machine; I did the reseach, read all the customer's review, and the machine doesn't live up to the review. Don't know what to do with it yet. The milk just doens't heat up and the foam over flow, so will have to stop the heating process."
1,Cuisinart Disappointment,"Typically like Cuisinart brand. But, this item is the exception. It is terribly noisy (sounds like a 747 taking off in the kitchen!) and bounces down the counter every time you use it.The machine itself seems to be built sturdy. But, I very rarely use it as the inconvenience of having to chase it down the counter before it falls off. Even after wedging the machine up against the wall and in-between the other coffee pot it still shakes -- plus, don't forget the airplane taking off every time you turn it on."
3,sub-par steam wand,"First of all, it does make excellent espresso.That is not my qualm at all.My issue lies solely with the steaming wand.The metal cylinder that is around it to begin with will literally ruin your milk.It's really only good for making scalded cappuccinos. If you want to make quality micro-foam for lattes, then take that thing off immediately.Also, it takes my machine about 15 seconds to begin steaming after I switch it to that setting.It then proceeds to make strange gurgling noises at me while it does so.Additionally, there is no way to control the amount of steam. It's just on/off. And if you switch it to off, you have to wait another 15 seconds if you want to steam more milk or even just clear the wand.It is possible to make a good latte with this thing, you just have to kind of trick it into doing what you want.Which is frustrating, I'd like to think that a 100+ dollar coffee machine could function easily."
1,Great until it broke,"This espresso maker was great until it broke, after less than a year of light use. For something this expensive, I would have expected a life of at least 5 years.Very disappointing....."
1,"Broken, Just Out of the Box","As others before me have pointed out: this is a cheapo machine. I can't attest to its ability to make a good espresso; I can attest to the fact that when I took it out of the box, the flimsy plastic clips (meant to secure the rinky-dink plastic water tank to the unit) tumbled out separately--they had broken off at some point between manufacturing and arriving to my apartment. Now it's the repackaging shuffle, and the waste-of-time trudge down to the post office. Definitely not recommended."
2,"Love the latte, Hate the leaking","When I first ordered the Espresso Maker it arrived quickly. Made myself a latte and I thought, ""Ahhhh, great Latte!"" Then I noticed the machine leaked from underneath around the pump area. I contacted Amazon and they quickly exchanged the machine.The second machine worked just as well. The latte was excellent. However same problem. The machine started leaking just like the first one.I can only conclude that since both machines leak, it is poorly designed. Once you shut off the machine and it starts to cool down, it leaks. The only way to stop the leaking is to remove the water supply (in other words the tank)."
3,Good machine and excellent customer service from Cuisinart,"A couple of cautions for this machine:Among other things...1. watch drips during the making and make sure that they turn whitish so you can be sure the process has completed and most likely the pressure exhausted;2. steam would usually seep out, giving you the sign that it is safe to remove the portafilter holder;3. if you feel that the portafilter holder is extremely tight, you can still remove it for cleaning but be very careful. You will remove it extra slow to allow steam to release.4. without the above precautions, you are likely to make a mess when force removing the holder, as many users have indicated.Excellent customer service from the manufacturer:I have had my machine replaced without questions asked after paying $ 10 shipping and another $ 20 to have the defected one shipped back."
5,Expresso maker,"I am very happy with my Cuisinart expresso maker. We have looked for a long time for machine like the ones that we saw and used in Australia. This is it and it works extremely well. We had a small unit in the past that just did not have the pressure power to produce a rich cup of expresso or latte.A good cup of expresso coffee with frothed milk takes practice and a little more work but it is worth it.If you have not used a machine like this before, be patient. Watch the video and practice. Also be sure to wipe and clean the frothing rod immediately after use. This machine worked more smoothly than others I have tried."
4,EM100 is a keeper,"I own a Krup steam espresso machine, the amount of water for making froth and espresso is just impossible to get it right, so I decide to get a pump espresso machine. After comparing many machines for price, tank capacity, cup height, I choose EM100. After one month, I found EM100 espresso is as good as other more expensive machines, making froth does take some practice, somehow the initial steam is always weak, so I usually wait a minute more for the steam to build up, after steam is strong and powerful, frothing is very easy. The reasons for 4 star not 5 are, pump is loud, steam is not instant(when switching on steam, it takes a minute or so for pump to kick in for real steam to come out)"
2,"good espresso, defective machine","I have had a lot of trouble with this product. I thought the Cuisinart brand would deliver better value. Here's the sequence:1. Received the machine, used it for about a month, when I noticed a burning smell. A few days later it completely stopped functioning.2. I called Cuisinart for instructions. They told me to pay them $10 for their shipping and, when I received the replacement, to send back the defective machine (at my expense: $24).3. The new machine arrived, and I sent off the old one.4. Plugged it in, the machine got hot, got hotter, the light telling me the machine was ready to go never went out. Finally unplugged it and called Cuisinart again. This time they said UPS would pick it up (after I repacked it) at their expense and a third one would arrive in 5-10 biz days.5. Received the 3rd machine 3 days ago, and so far, so good.This machine makes a really good cup of espresso. The milk foamer is so-so. But based on my experience, I would not recommend it."
3,bad experience with a good machine,"I bought the machine about a month ago and after I got used to it I like it it. it is very different than the cheap espresso machines that I had used all my life, it only gets the best flavor out of the coffee. It does use a lot more coffee and water than the cheaper alternatives. after having it for about a week I started having problems with it not turning on when I wanted it, every now and then it just would not go on. I called the service number and the first time I was told to disconnect it for awhile and try it again but that did not work so they had to send me a new machine. This is a perfect machine for some one who enjoys an occassional espresso, you will enjoy it. It may not be the best machine for some one like myself that drinks about four espressos a day, The way the machine works it does not get every drop of flavor out of the coffee, it just gets the best out of it, so you get better coffee but less of it."
3,This machine has problems but also has a 3 year warranty,"The machine leaked from the area around where the basket attaches early on, but we just now are sending it back because the pump is malfunctioning (not turning off when it should causing water to leak all over the counter). I have read reviews complaining that people were charged shipping costs, even when the unit was new. Our unit was purchased 16 months ago. In California, you do not have to pay shipping either way. It was simple to call up and get another unit. Downside: They notify UPS to pick up the old unit right away, but it takes about 7 business days to get the replacement. You have to find an alternative for making coffee for about a week."
4,good machine bad tamper,"the packaging from amazon had much to be desired so did the shipping from UPS, it looked like the box was had been dropped on its end, however the packaging from Cuisinart was superb no signs of damage even on the part that was dropped. now on to the machine. It heats up incredibly fast just a few min from cold water to brewing. The portafilter is a bit strange in that you have to change filters to brew single or double instead of having two different ones. but when all is said and done it does make a good shot with a nice Creme'. the frothing wand is well positioned and does a good job at making a Latte. all this being said if you buy this or any other machine do yourself a favor and buy a good tamper the ones included with them are complete rubbish the one in mine broke before reaching 30 lbs. I ordered a new one at the same time as the machine should be here soon."
4,Love this machine!,"We have this espresso machine at our office and love it! It's easy to use, quick and easy to clean. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we are on our 3rd machine. Each one has lasted 1-2 years and there are several people that use it each day so it does get a work out each day! But after a while, something seems to go wrong with the steamer part of it. I have a different one at home but this one is definitely easier to use!"
1,Cuisinart Warranty service is horrible...,We purchased a EM-100 Espresso machine based on previous good experience with the same model. We received the unit from Amazon and right out of the box it does not pull water in and is effectively defective. I called Cuisinart expecting a quick resolution. I was wrong. I was told by Cuisinart that they do not pay for shipping for defective items and that Amazon should carry the shipping cost for the return. I find this in poor taste by Cuisinart and would not recommend this company based on this experience. So if you are reading this buy another brand and save yourself time and aggravation.
2,Pendiente,"Tengo varios artefactos de esta marca, por eso decidimos comprar esta espresso machine, mi sorpresa es que cuando calienta el boton o perilla central se endurece, parece que fuera a salirse. Le he escrito a la marca y no me ha respondido. Por eso debo calificarla con 2 estrellas."
2,Good coffee bad milk frother,"I am a coffee addict, and this machine makes a really good coffee, with the crema and all that. The frother worked great the first time I used it, but after the second time, the frother was just not working well (I made sure to clean it per the instructions). I am returning this item, there most be something better out there for this price"
1,nothappy,The espresso maker is the worst one i have had in the last 25 years.I would not recommend it to anyone. I sent it back hoping for a refund.It took too long time to create steam to the milk and did a poor job of it.The pump vibrated the espresso cup so bad it i had to hold it in place.
1,Don't waste money on a toy.,"We went to a Cuban restaurant here in Nashville and my wife had a Cuban coffee.The machine was similar to this,the waiter said they paid 68 dollars for it,so I assume it's the one sold at Bed Bath and Beyond.So,she wanted one as she doesn't like my Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine - New 2009 Model V3,nor do I.I think I wrote a review on that,but it's back in the kitchen and the Cuisinart is on the back porch.For a quick espresso this could work,trying to use the milk functions for multiple drinks,this one is just under powered.Someday I'll get another La Pavoni or a good USA made one ,if that ever happens."
2,Not so Good,"In the first day I liked of the machine, but 2 day, started to leak on the side of the cup, and doesn't make enough foam...I was disapointed and I returned after that I bought a De longh machine and now I'm happy."
2,A Weak Attempt at Espresso,"I had an ancient Krups espresso machine and decided I wanted an upgrade. Researched and chose the Cuisinart EM-100 as a reasonably priced entry level machine. My first unit had to be returned as the power button would not stay on. My second unit operates properly but there are multiple quality issues. The espresso is weak despite multiple attempts and variations of grind and tamping pressure. The unit advertises that it heats water for making tea - but it only heats to 165-180 degrees - not hot enough for tea. I have contacted Cuisinart by phone and email to see if they have any suggestions and have received no responses. All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I have had good experiences with Cuisinart products in the past but will probably never buy another."
4,Frik'n Love it - Makes perfect Espresso!,"Now I know why I'd sometimes get really bitter espresso at Starbucks. The 'Barrista' would tamp the coffee down to tight. I always wondered - I'd complain, they'd remake it - then it would be good, nice, velvety, smooth, a pleasure to sip on. I didn't understand. You grind the beans, put them in the holder, steam the beans - how could the come out different? Well, they can.The 'crema' is just perfect with this maker - Really satisfied.Read the 'quick' start booklet - Didn't bother with the 15 min DVD that comes with the maker."
2,Espresso so so,"aftera few weeks of practice, just not able to that flavor like SB. Don't like how you have to manually turn knob to the right in order to stop machine's water flow."
5,Sweet buy,Did my homework and read many reviews on different machines before making this purchase for my wife. Very simple to use and have had no problems with it. I would definately recomend it to anyone that is in the market for a quality machine for a median price...
2,not what I was expecting,"I am very peculiar about my coffee and I was looking for a replacement for my Krups. This was not it. The design is beautiful. The functionality though is not there. Water goes thru way to fast, coffee cannot be made strong in any way... not exactly what I wanted. I am returning the item"
1,Big brand Poor product,"Poor product engineering, too many mechanical failures.If not for amazon's excellent customer service this will be sitting in my garage now. Power button didn't work for me. I had to hold the power button to make it work. The unit was too noisy too. Steamer clearance from the ground is too low. You can't take out the steamed milk easily off the steamer. I returned the unit back and requested replacement from amazon hoping to give it a second chance. The replacement unit had different problems. One of the hooks that holds the water tank was broken. I could not get the unit to build steam. Returned that too. People who are satisfied with this product must be lucky ones.Quality of espresso is not that great. For the price point I would have kept the unit if there were no mechanical problems.I recommend amazon to stop selling this product."
1,GIGANTIC PIECE OF CRAP,We made one espresso and the power button broke. We had to send it back the day after we recieved it.
2,"a good coffee maker, but NOT an espresso maker.","I have used this machine for about six months now. Once I figured out what grind would work with it, I had no trouble getting a consistent brew. Of good coffee. Not espresso.I have tried six different beans--from Starbucks, and from Caribou Coffee, plus a couple of the grocery store brand--and both home grinding and store grinding--and none produce espresso--a good rich coffee, yes, with crema--but not espresso.On other issues--I don't mind the plastic construction. It's easy to clean up. The cup heater works well. The machine is durably made, but the pushbutton on-off switch started failing to stay on about 90% of the time about three months after purchase. Tape holds it in.The replacement portafilter for my other cheap machine arrived today--and I A-B'd them. Passable espresso from the Saeco AROMA, good rich coffee from the Cuisinart EM-100.But, I do want espresso; I don't need a coffee machine."
4,Good Buy!,"BY no means is this a top of the line machine, but for the price it's excellent.Here is where the value is... 3 year warranty. Quite important for daily users."
3,this machine requires a lot of experimentation,"Getting good espresso from this machine requires a lot of experimentation. Getting good results is a combination of using the proper coffee grind and the pressure of packing the coffee into the portafilter. The courser you grind your coffee the faster this machine brews, the weaker the flavor. Cheap burr grinders don't grind coffee fine enough for this machine. If you get the grind too fine or pack it with too much pressure the machine will not brew, it simply sits there and builds up pressure which gets dangerous! Having a good grinder with many adjustable grind levels is the key to getting good results with this machine. I've had mine for over four years and I'm getting really good espresso with it, but first I had to go out and buy a better grinder. (a Baratza Virtuoso grinder)"
4,Great for the price!,"We are loving this machine! I make my husband a latte every morning and myself one in the afternoon. We've had it for a month and the only complaint I have is that sometimes the frothing wand leaks after I use it. The steam last for a long time, we lot our milk hot! Looks great too."
1,"Poor customer service, cheaply made","To start with, the machine leaked water out of the bottom from the beginning.A couple of months before the 1-yr warranty was up, the plastic (!) piece holding he steaming wand broke and sent the wand shooting under pressure. Cuisinart agreed to replace the machine, but I had to pay return shipping AND new shipping. I believe they sent me a refurbished machine, as immediately the wand would barely release steam and no water stream through the wand at all. The front knob would get so hot under all of the pent-up pressure, that it was too hot to touch! A couple of times the wand came shooting off. I called back, but Cuisinart told me now the warranty was up, even though they just sent me a faulty machine! Told me they might make an exception, but again I would have to pay shipping both ways! What?!?No more Cuisinart for me."
1,unreliable,"I bought this Cuisinart EM-100 about six months ago. I used it aproximately two or three times a week, and it made wonderful espresso until three weeks ago. I cleaned the machine according to the DVD instructions supplied with it and without any coffee in the basket, the water flowed freely. When I add coffee and the heater light goes out, all I get is the peculiar noise it makes when turning the control knob, but no coffee. One more thing: from the day I started using it, it leaked water on my kitchen counter. Since it was making good coffee, I decided to live with this minor annoyance. I advise any potential buyers to look elsewhere. The Cuisinart EM-100 is a waste of money, and an exercise in frustration.Cuisinart EM-100 1000-Watt 15-Bar Espresso Maker, Stainless Steel"
2,Can't find the water leak!,"I have mixed feelings about this product. The coffee is good but for some reason the tank has developed a leak. I can not find where the water is coming from but everyday there is a puddle of water on my counter top. I am very disappointed with the quality, I have been a huge fan of Cuisinart products for years and this has made me question a couple of recent purchases."
5,Em-100,"Have had this thing for about a month now, many shots of espresso later and I can give it a review now. No problems yet just great shots. Gets hot fast, not too loud, easy to operate, reheats fast for second batches, holds enough water. If this machine keeps running like it does now I will be very happy."
2,Didn't even work out of the box,"When I first unpacked the espresso maker I was pleased with the construction. I watched the DVD and then attempted the first step, which was to rinse the espresso maker by running plain water through it. I tried and tried and simply couldn't get the water to run through it. I ended up returning the EM100 to Amazon."
2,Very disappointing,"Could not pull a good shot of espresso. There was a nice crema but no strength. I used the single and double filters with different beans and tamping pressure, yet no improvement. Using pods made no difference.It's difficult to make multiple cups in a timely fashion. After each cup, the porta filter holder is a wet mess and has to be thoroughly cleaned before making another.Water appeared to leak from underneath and I found the drip tray filling up quickly which I gather is from cooled down steam.I will look for another product."
1,Disappointed from the start...,"Took the machine out of the box Christmas day, read the instructions, went to do the initial rinse, and water would not flow from the reservoir. Now that I've read more reviews, I see this is a common defect. I'll be shopping for a different brand."
2,"Nice froth, but filter basket leaks","Nice shot, nice crema, but the filter basket leaked despite all troubleshooting efforts. That was annoying and messy enough for me to give up on this machine."
4,"Easy to use, easy to clean.","I bought this as a gift for the GF, naturally that gives me 24/7 access to it. I have been wired since Christmas. Very easy to use and clean. Only draw back is that the pump can cause the whole thing to vibrate so keep your eye on the little cups as they want to run away from the stream of hot caffeinated goodness."
1,Work good just first week,I'm going to return it! Is not working as espresso it work as brew coffee .. Very disappointed !!! .
4,Good machine,"I use my EM-100 almost daily and it works great. I have had no problems with it in the several months I've had it. It makes good espresso with a nice crema, and steams milk very fast. I love the 53oz water reservoir - it allows me to make several drinks before refilling. I do have a few minor complaints, but none are show stoppers. The machine is noisy and vibrates a lot. If you have demi cups on the warmer they rattle like crazy when you fire up the machine, and you have to be careful the cup under the portafilter doesn't vibrate out from under it during operation. The power button is a little cheesy so I worry about longer term reliability, but fine so far. The steamer will dispense a fair amount of water before the steam comes, so you have to manage that or your milk will be full of water. The machine also produces a fair amount of runoff so the removable drip tray has to be emptied often. Even with those minor complaints, this is a great machine for the price."
4,Good little machine.,"Unlike other reviewers who seem to be highly experienced espresso experts, this was my first espresso machine and it managed to make excellent coffee even in my clumsy, technologically-challenged hands. Some of the things I like most: (i) easy to load and unload the ground coffee; (ii) works reliably; and (iii) makes a mean cup of really creamy espresso. I have not yet mastered the milk frothing wand, but I'm sure that after watching the included DVD it will be a no-brainer. The only thing I don't like is the ""coffee pod"" system. Although it may not be this machine's fault, the pod system makes crummy coffee, which I unfortunately learned after dishing out $15 for a box of Illy pods. So, if you want to make espresso the old fashioned way, this is quite a nifty little gadget at a very reasonable price."
4,"Solid machine, great value","I bought this from Amazon/JC Penny online for around $120. This is my 5th expresso machine over the past 15 years. I have had it over two months, which means I have used it over 60 times. this makes one of the best Latte's I have ever made...and I consider myself an expert! The shot cup/tin is large enough to pack in enough grounds to make a good strong expresso..but certainly not two...none of the ones I have owned make two shots at once that was strong enough. Steaming the milk takes some time, but it works fine. I took off the attachment on the steamer wand because it frothed the milk too quickly, before the temp reached 160-165 degrees. ..now it works fine, but slower. I steam my milk first and the do the espresso second, counter to what the directions tell you to do.Bottom line: great machine for the money, solid quality, I don't think you will find better at this price,"
2,Not the best at making Espresso,I have had 2 Saeco Espresso makers that made the perfect shot everytime. I paid 300.00 for the Saeco units. The last one stopped working in a year. I purchased this unit after reading the reviews and am comfortable with the brand which carries a 3 year warranty. But I still have problems getting the tightness of the espresso correct to get a good shot out of it. If you make it to tight it will just not work at all. And if it's not tamped down enough it will look like regular coffee and not taste so great. It is great for frothing milk and making quick hot water. I have had it for a month now and try to use it every single day and have only had around 5 shots that are the 3 colors and have good crema on the top. I am disappointed in this unit.
2,Disappointed,"Bought the machine for a Christmas gift, at first it look well build but once we started setting up to make espresso's water leaked from tank located on the back of unit and the mess began. Send idem back for refund with no problems, I do not recommenced this machine"
4,Great for the price,I love this Espresso Maker. It works great and makes great espresso. The only problem I have had was that some parts were missing when I received it.
1,Utterly Disappointed,"I had such high hopes for this unit, and I liked that it came with a three year warranty. I have other Cuisinart appliances that I swear by. However...1) The unit leaks out the back where the power cord comes in even though the reservoir is seated properly. Consequently, the counter ends up with a pond of water. It also leaks from the upper unit and ends up filling the drip tray. Got a lovely brown waterfall to go with the distilled-water pond.2) It vibrates so badly that my Bodum cup walks dangerously to the edge. Have to hold it in place. Earthquake near the distilled-water pond with the brown waterfall.3) The steam is a joke. I could do better with a straw and lung power. Where's a geyser when you need one?Needless to say, it will be with a saddened heart that I hand this bugger over to the UPS guy tomorrow. :-("
4,espresso maker,"stanless steel, 1000 watts, makes this unit great for medum use. looks good in kitchen also,makes a good cup of espresso, what's not to like."
2,somethings not right,"I purchased this espresso machine around 5 years ago. It worked well into the third year and then I had problems with it...grounds in my cup, not frothing, etc. So, I called and they sent me a new machine. The new machine lasted less than a year before I had problems with it...grounds in my cup, etc. So I called and was sent a replacement...two more times actually and this last time was 6 months ago. No matter what I do and how I clean it, I still have a problem with grounds (the machines worked great for the first few months) and no one at the company seems to be able to help with the problem...they just send me a new one. I really did love the espresso that came out of the machine...when it worked well. I have been making espresso at home for almost 20 years now and started out with a krups mini...which I should have never gotten rid of. Needless to say, I am done with this espresso machine (somethings not right with the pressure) and just bought a different brand."
4,Pleasant!,"I have been using MJ's products since they were first introducted. The body lotion is perfect after a shower, especially if the user is in an area with ""hard"" water. The product is in a small container so it is TSA approved for travel. After years of use, I still have not found a product better than Jordan's....all of his products."
5,Great avain book for anatomy and histology,"This book is wonderful at explaining the anatomy of birds. There are detailed photographs, microscope images, and a few schematics. Each figure has a great caption. As a vet student, I highly recommend this book to other people interested in avian anatomy."
4,Almost Perfect,"All the songs are the originals, but Red Red Wine says (Edit) which was confusing since the song has no bad words. What they mean is it is shortened...the keep me rock'n all of the time area is gone. All you have is the basic poem stuff, which is ok, but a little annoying. Should have left it or have two versions. Everything else is excellent quality and brought back 80's memories."
2,Deceptive Title,"This is fictional book masquerding as non fiction.There are no inspiring, educational,or insightful case histories.The book is pure tongue in cheek comedy-satire.For instance,his response to a hypochondriac is to suggest stopping exercise and to eat a lot of junk food to encourage a heart attack and thus avoid a worse fate such as Alzheimer's disease or other slowly progressive diseases.The patient is gleeful when he later reports he has his cholesterol up to 500.The doctor tells another patient their skin cancer is due to their not appreciating and loving such a sensitive organ.Some may find this book clever and amusing,but I found it to be full of dumb humor.I found his first book(Bag Balm and Duct Tape)to be worthwhile reading,but this book was a big letdown."
1,Not true,"It's disappointing to take home a book which is subtitled ""Tales of a Country Doctor,"" and then read in the fine print of the prologue, ""There will be some who ... will complain about the _fact_ of a particular matter [being] ... in need of correction.... You are in the minority. The sooner you learn ... that the greatness of Truth is that it transcends the lowly fact, the better off you will be.""In other words, not only is this another Palmer wannabe, but it's pure fiction masquerading as down-home fact."
2,not dependable,"I really liked this at first, and it'll definitely wake you up with a bang, but now it's been a few months and the clock stops when it feels like it and I have to hit it (more like a smack) to get it going, but if I'm asleep when it does this and I need to be woken up at a certain time, I'm screwed. I initially bought it because I like analog and don'l like using batteries-""conservationist""-but just ordered a battery alarm clock and will have to use my battery recharger."
3,Big Ben 1964 Classic Clock,"The Big Ben 1964 Classic alarm clock is a replica of the original 1964 Big Ben by Westclox. It looks just like the 1964 clock, but is much lighter than the original. It has wind up keys for the time and alarm. It comes with a one year guarantee. I have had mine for several weeks with no problems. I just hope it will be as durable as the original."
1,well known brand name - but my clock disappoints,"Big Ben Classic - NOT SO IN MY CASE. Course, I'm 80 and things change a lot - but for years going to med school, I used Big and Little Ben clocks to get me up in time for class. Later, to get my up for surgery.We all wear out, and so do clocks. I ordered the Big Ben Classic recently to make sure I get to the doctor on time - by now, I'm on the other end - the patient.For my Big Ben, one has great difficulty turning the time knob and the time setting knob. It winds easily enough, but the ""ringing"" is too quiet and too brief.If all the clocks are like mine - and since they are mass produced, I assume they are - I am unable to recommend this clock to anyone."
5,THE best GIS related book focussing on Public Health,The scoop:* Book consistently focuses on GIS usage in healthcare.* Practically applicable ideas.* Exhaustive and highly informative lessons learnt chapter.* Very clear and crisp presentation.* IT part needs better information.I had the opportunity to talk with Dr. Melnick at OHSU (top notch medical university) for my PSU MBA project. He is clearly a subject matter expert. Knows the micro and macro problems and opportunities in this field.
3,"Simple, basic, short","I was a bit dissapointed when I got this, since it really doesn't have anything 'new' that isn't in Edred Thorsson's books. It seems more like a basic overview geared towards people with no experience and knowledge in runelore and teutonic magic. Assuming that is this book's purpose, then it's not bad, but if you have Thorsson's other books you probably will not get anything new out of this one."
4,"A Good Introduction to Teutonic Faith, Troth & Magick","Although ""Teutonic Magick"" is a book of few pages, Edred Thorsson has put a great deal of information into these pages.Herein one finds details of:> The key deities of the Teutonic Religion (Woden, Thor, Freya, Frigga, et.al.)> The divine realms of Yggdrasill> The 24 Runes of the Elder Futhark> .... And much more.This book is clearly intended as an introduction for those who have little or no knowledge of the Teutonic Faith, its troth and magick - and it fulfills that intent admirably.Well worth the couple of $$ asked, and at that price buy several to give to friends who may have an interest in how our faith lives on today."
3,!0 Minute Introduction,"If you really just want an overview of Norse mysticism in under an hour, this is your book. I was expecting brief but this can be read in one bathroom sitting.However, in the few minutes it takes to read this book, it does accomplish it's mission and by the end, you will either go for more or know enough to walk away."
2,Runes,"This is a small book and I feel a relatively good introduction for beginners to the Runes and Teutonic magic. It covers the Futhark and the basics of the Norse Pantheon. Once read though, I recommend students move to books by Freya Aswynn and Edred Thorsson as well as others, all sold here on Amazon. Recommend."
3,O.k.,"Well I've like Fey's music for the last 11 years, and I am well aware that this is the fourth greatest hits collection Sony has launched from her in them wanting to make the most money from her. I'm letting you know to save your money. The best collection of her hits is one from Mexico called ""Antologia"" which has all her singles from 1995 til 2002 and includes a DVD with all her videos from ""Fey"" up to ""Vertigo."" If you feel you really need this CD, go for it, but try to get the one I just mentioned better."
5,Love love love this line!!,"This line is incredible!! The orange/vanilla scent is beautiful and not too fruity...just perfect. And let me just say that amazon has the BEST prices on this line...considering I have gotten it at other ""markets"" and it was much, much more!!"
3,"not bad, but not great","This item isn't bad, but I would have liked it better if it had some kind of tension control; an option to increase the resistance."
2,Flimsier than I thought it would be,"This looked like a better idea than it turned out to be in practice. It is to light to stay in place if you do not put a lot of weight on it which, if you intend to use it sitting down while watching TV for instance, you won't necessarily do. So when I try to pull the toe bar down, basically all I accomplish is scooting the entire mechanism backward. It's awkward."
1,Poor unit not worth the price,"I have and have had Plantar Fasciitis for several years. I recently decided to something about it. I bought this product in the hopes it could help. It didn't, it can't, and it never will. To put it a simply, the spring which produces the tension for this device is too weak to achieve any meaningful strengthening of the foot muscles. On my first few tries with this device, I was easily able to do 10-20 repetitions multiple times at the maximum tension allowed by the device.And to make matters worse, there is no adjustment on the device for the amount of tension. Avoid this device if you are looking for any meaningful strengthening and conditioning of your foot muscles. It will be a waste of money."
3,Foot Exerciser,It does not seem to offer much resistance when using the device. Perhaps the spring is not wound tight enough?
2,Not My Style,"This author and book were noted in biography American Rose (Gypsy Rose Lee), and subject matter interested me. Not crazy about the author's writing style. Must have something to do with the time period?,but it just doesn't appeal to me. Have finished a few chapters but just can't get into it. I may try to read more in future, once I've finished other books."
3,Narrow In Focus,"Author could have included coaches from earlier era who are still living. Coach Ralph Hatley in Memphis comes to mind. Flatt was poor choice given the lack of character he has demonstrated in his program/leadership and accompanying lack of veracity in confronting his ""sins"" before TSSAA"
2,THE HOOD AND THE HAUGHTY,"They're both from the ghetto but he's now a CPA who dresses like James Dean and still rides his Harley while trying to make a difference where he grew up. She's left her roots and is an IRS agent with a ""new"" life that is a lie. She's told everyone that she grew up in a middle class neighborhood, her parents live in Florida (so when she takes her vacation she's out of town with them), when her mother's really dead and her abusive father is in a nursing home. He's earthy and she acts haughty trying to project the right image. She's assigned to audit one of his clients and things spiral out of control from there."

5,Great CD!,This is one of my favorite Christmas CD's. I can't wait to get this CD out every Christmas. It has a variety of singer's and songs.
5,Intense and impossible to put down,"I read Don't Come Out, start to finish in one day. Klatt tells an intense, harsh tale in a fast and very readable style. The trouble in this book got so bad I didn't think there was any way out...which kept me hooked right until the end."
2,I Love the Grand Canyon...,"I've been to the Grand Canyon (only reason I gave this two stars). Skip ahead to the last few minutes for the Grand Canyon at sunset, it's gorgeous. Sadly, the rest of this documentary doesn't do justice to the Canyon. Nothing against the talent that put it together, but from the many stock shots to the canned music, and the laconic narrator, this is the kind of thing that would've zoned me right out in elementary school."
5,Don't Buy This if You expect it to last more than 30 yrs.,"I have an upholstery shop and a good steamer comes handy sometimes to take out fabric wrinkles. And sometimes it can be the difference between a so-so result and a great result. I previously owned a model J-3, the predecessor to this model, and it lasted about 30 yrs. with a few minor repairs, which is to be expected. For a while I was doing drapery installations and the J-3 got thrown on the truck (sometimes literally). The only other piece of equipment that has lasted as long in my shop is a Consew sewing machine. Buy this, and if you are in business for 30 yrs., reward yourself and buy another. P.S. Don't buy the one with the bottle, the cheaper one, except as a backup."
5,another sublime triumph from America's greatest writer,"Did I and the 'reader from Toronto' read the same work!!??!!??! Discerning readers know that Updike is the premiere American novelist of the age, and 'Toward the End of Time one of his finest achievements, worthy of being placed alongside 'The Coup' and 'A Month of Sundays.' In inimitable, pellucid prose, with savvy insight and tender irony, Updike envisions a future which casts light and shadow upon our redoubtable present. Hardly a genre item, 'Toward the End of Time' gently employs a soupcon of sci-fi with unprecendented grace and sophistication to produce a unique and compelling work that expands the already vast horizons of the Updike oeuvre. Highly, highly recommended."
2,This book stinks!,"The only reason I gave this book two stars is because the author's use of the English language is excellent. The vocabulary is exceptional, the words flow well and the story is easy to read. Unfortunately, he could have definitely put his talents to better use. He also should have spent more time developing a coherent plot. I enjoyed the sections where he was existential and scientific, but much of this book is, quite frankly, pornography. Readers of that bent would be better served with a Penthouse magazine. What is it with his obsession with sex? I was given this book as a gift and I'm going to donate it to the library as soon as possible. If you like him as an author you'll probably enjoy this book, but if you're unfamiliar with him, as I was, you'll probably be disappointed."
1,"Sheer torture. Boring, gloomy, inconsistent, incoherent.","I approached this book with eagerness and enthusiasm as it was the first book I read of this supposed 'master'. Updike is a master of the English language, that is indisputable. As can be evidenced by the seemingly endless and painfully deatiled descriptions of flowers and landscape, he must also be close to being an authority in horticulture. And surely he must have written better works in the past, since barring the Updike signature, he would have never made it past a junior editor with this one. What a drag. It took me months to finish this one, since I would fall asleep every second page. I only finished it because I could not believe he would have written that many pages essentially leading up to nothing. I must stop before I start swearing again for having so supremely wasted my time reading this self-serving compilation of words."
3,Depressing but memorable,"The time is the not-too-distant future after a brief and devastating nuclear exchange between the U.S. and China. The book's main character is an aging and not-very-likable sex-obsessed retiree named Ben Turnbull who is sinking into a depressed and depressing old age. Beautifully written and very readable, as you would expect from one of America's most accomplished writers, but the overall tone is very dark. Ben's world was not a world I enjoyed being in very much. (Why is John Updike always so obsessed with the sexual lives of his characters?)"
2,"Flowers 5, Ideas 2","Many great ideas float around ""Toward the End of Time,"" but ultimately it's a novel about prostate surgery and flowers. A crippled United States, time travel, mysterious celestial bodies and nonorganic life forms run around beneath the author's narrative, but the main character is a drag. I wish he had expanded the book and concentrated on the fantastical elements."
1,A bloated and boring bit of self-indulgence,"A bloated and boring bit of self-indulgence. Ever the A+ student, Updike borrows from his extensive reading to pad this sad bit of work. OK, so he doesn't like women. We got the message years ago. So Updike likes plants -- maybe he could write a book on gardening. Please, someone stop this man before he publishes another novel! Enough is enough."
4,Flora and Fauna can make a man yawn-a,"While the book is a brilliant work of sexagenarian introspection and obliquely described dystopian SF and the prose is lyrical, the dense descriptions of flowers, trees, birds, leaf shapes which serve as prologue to each chapter and section are stultifying. After about the 10th round of these long passages of horticultural effervescence, I found myself skimming over them to get to the story.A similar but milder impatience with all the descriptions of sexual acts and their accompanying odors and effluvia. It all gets a bit boring without some story to propell the book forward. And there is a story, and it's a great story, but the book could have been about 50 pages shorter."
4,"Weird, Intriguing and Ultimately Interesting","As the title implies, this book is about nearing the end of time--in two realms. First the end of a man, the protagonist, Ben Turnbull's life, and the end of life in this country as we known it, the end of the United States' dominance as a world power.Set in 2020 after the fairly, but not totally, destructive Sino-American war, life goes on in a greatly changed United States. And life as Ben has known it is ebbing away, too, to old age, remembrances of life that once was and to delusions some of which make up a major part of the book.A book about change and about aging. A somewhat weird, but intriguing and ultimately interesting book.Sex, real or imagined, makes up a major part of the old's man's thinking, causing the reader to wonder and perhaps even ask their aging friends, ""Do old men really think about sex this much.....""In the end, the reader may finish the book wondering what was ""real"" and what was imagined. But that's part of the book's intrigue."
3,"I enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure why.","There was too much description, very little plot and it was depressing, up until the end, but the images this author paints are worth reading. Since I just passed my 53 birthday, I understand what he is writing about. I can't say I like the pictures he draws, but I certainly can see them. This book is worth your time and effort, but definitely not for fun."
2,Inconsistency is the Problem,"I have never given up on reading a book in all of my 48 years(although I did have to take a 15 year break before I could finish Joseph Heller's ""God Knows"") but I came close to giving up on this one. Updike can truly spin a masterful phrase and some of the writing is outstanding. For example, his description of the leaves changing color in the fall is comparable to John Steinbeck's description of grease coagulating on plates in ""Cannery Row"". But the inconsistencies were too much. Whenever he delved into the ""supposed"" future, the narrative did just not work. The imagination is missing from these sections. The novel would have been at least a ""4 star"" if Updike had stayed with the narrative of Ben and his view of the end of a man's life. And drop the image of a prostitute's thong tan line as a deer's white tail!"
3,is this what men are really thinking?,"Updike is a fabulous writer, but I have not been altogether comfortable in the universe that he is conjuring. Possibly it's his age, but the undiluted ""masculinity"" (polite word for sexism) of this character has been a bit of a shock to me! In many ways, I imagine that reading this book has been an experience akin to what readers of horror experience! Are all old guys obsessed with their genitals and failing potency, and do they really think that a 14 year old who is not being paid would consent to being touched by them and apparently enjoy it? Well, it is a work of fiction, I must remind myself. It's easy to forget, particularly as Updike is the same age, race and inhabits the same geopgraphical area as the protagonist.Still, the novel is beautifully written and quite engrossing, in a car crash sort of way."
5,Westlock Manual,"Just what I wanted, this clock will wake up the dead! I sleep with a Hunter Fan and a white noise maker and take serious pain medication for my lower back and this is just what I needed to wake me up. Wind by just holding the key with Rt hand and then turn the clock not the key and watch out for your fingernails hitting the other controls. To set the time fast or slow use an end of a metal nail-file to just barely move the lever. My clock gains 2 min a week, I'll take that at this price...this ain't no Rolex folks!!!! Oh, practice turning it off a few times b/c it's quite startling when it rings, just what I needed!!Mike"
2,It's JUST OK,"I agree the finish is cheap and for the price this clock is just ok. I had it for about 2 months and then the alarm hand fell off, sucks to be me but i am kinda rough on my clocks."
1,Looks cheap!,I bought this for my mother at her request. She wanted a simple alternative to the digital clocks that are becoming hard for her to read.The brassy finish is the cheapest you can imagine.The wind up and alarm mechanisms are difficult to use.Skip this one.
3,Mechanical Clock Results,"All mechanics on the rear(alarm set, time set, and wind ups) are very close together. Makes it difficult for these functions. Also, wind up is counter clockwise; just a little weird.Clock works fine as does alarm."
3,You get what you pay for,"This clock is in my workshop, ticking away. I use it every day. Now the review...The good:- It looks nice.- The classic mechanical ticking is either pleasant (my opinion) or annoying (my son's opinion).- The alarm is just like I remember... LOUD.The not so good:- It runs fast and has to be adjusted back as much as 10 minutes daily.- The primary wind-up key feels a little flimsy, but has not given trouble yet.For the price, I think it is an adequate wind-up clock. You might like it."
1,Good style and loved how it was battery free,I liked the style and that it did not require batteries but it isn't very sturdy. It broke when it was dropped.
1,I've got the another product,It's amazing but opening the post box I realize that it's not the same clock that I purchased. Not even similar. They sent me some travel digital clock. I'm sad. It's pretending to be a gift.
5,Great Clock,"I was looking for a loud clock that would wake my boyfriend up when I'm not there to push him out of bed! This is the clock! It does ""tick"" a little loud but it does the job!"
3,It's OK,"I loved the look of this clock and the fact that it's manual. Have had it for about a week now, and I'm still messing with calibrating it. Too fast, now too slow...one of these days I'll get it right. Also, the luminous hands aren't very bright. I've resorted to laying it atop my lamp for a couple of minutes before going to bed to brighten it. But if I wake up in the middle of the night after a few hours, it's dim again and I can't tell what time it is. And yes, be careful winding it, it tends to grab your fingers. Ouch!"
3,Westclox Ardmore,I have had this clock since 4-28-2011 and the clock died on me about two weeks ago. If you are just going to use this clock for power outage or something like that I would recommend it. But if you are going to use it as a alarm clock for every day clock I would not recommend it. It is very hard to set the time on the clock also. I really recommend the keywound Sternreiter alarm clock.
5,excellent clock,"I had purchased this clock about 6 years ago and it worked great. No stores in my area carry this product. It is extremely difficult to find westclox wind up alarm clocks and i didn't wan't a lesser brand. I purchased two from Amazon, they arrived the next day and I couldn;t be happier."
3,clock,Took FOREVER to receive....could have purchased at a drug store. I don't know what I was expecting but it was/is nothing special.I would purchase elsewhere & save the money.
3,The fastest clock in Jersey,"The clock is truly mechanical -- one reason why I bought it in the first place. You have to wind it up every day and you have to wind the alarm as well, every day. If you don't you will get a free long lay next day and it will be your fault. The alarm is nice and loud and you stop it with a little (mechanical) blocker. I am not bothered by the loud ticking, as it relaxes me. If you are sensitive about this, I suggest you go for one of those digital items. This clock offers you straight mechanics -- a celebration of simplicity paired with elegance and on top of it a great shiny, golden look.The only problem with the clock is that it is a bit rushed. After a full wind-up, I have a 23,5 day because the clock somehow runs a bit faster than it should. This varies roughly between 15 and 25 minutes each day. This is annoying as I have then also to correct the clock every day. For this nuisance I downgrade the rating to 3 points, otherwise I would simply love it."
5,Westclox Twin Bell Clock,I am very pleased with this clock - both the price & the clock itself. It was a gift for a 96 yr.old gentleman who now has trouble hearing .He has no trouble hearing it at all . It arrived in great condition & was pretty well packed for shipping.
2,"Loud Bell Alarm, Not Reliable though....","After owning this clock for over a month here's my verdict: For the price, it's a decent clock, but in the end you get what you paid for. As other reviewers have mentioned, it has a cheap brass finish (your fingerprints will be all over it), and the alarm bells are loud. The tick-toc isn't loud enough to disturb my sleep and setting the alarm is quite easy (just make sure the pin doesn't interfere with the alarm hammer). However, the clock has stopped numerous times (even after turning the key daily) making it an unreliable alarm clock. If you really want a reliable ""old school"" twin bell alarm clock- they cost around $50 online- they are made in Serbia (where those old school clocks were originally from); this clock is made in China and is a cheap knockoff of the real thing. Look elsewhere."
5,It's a great quality clock. I'm surprised,"When I ordered this clock, I was expected a low quality junky clock, like the one I used to own. This is a really great quality clock. The ticking sound is quiet for a winding clock too."
4,"Not, repeat not, calibrated","It's a handsome clock and once it's calibrated it'll be great. However, it lost two minutes per day for the first several days; a week later, I am still nudging the calibration bar a tiny bit per day, trying to get it to keep correct time. I have it dialed in to about a minute lost per two days so far. I think most people will like this clock--I ordered it because it requires no power, important on a boat--but be prepared to spend possibly several weeks tweaking the calibration to your satisfaction."
3,"I like what it does to my plastic, but overpriced","I don't park in the sun, but people think my 7 year old daily commuter CBR is new, because I apply this a few times a year."
2,What is up with the pricing?,"I've used Plexus for a lot of years, but I came here to buy a can, and the price is double what it was the last time I bought a can several years ago. As best I can tell, not a thing about the product has changed, and I get that prices have gone up in general on a lot of things. What amounts to 20%+ increase per year is stupid though, and I guess the empty can I have is the last one I'll ever buy."
5,Does the job where others have failed,"OK, I haven't tried every product in the world for the plastic divider in the house, but I know what doesn't work.Windex doesn't work, soap and water doesn't work, and multiple other products don't work.This does.I spray it in, use a cotton cloth and the streaks are gone. The dirt is gone. It is nice to not have to do something twice.Five stars for a product that works."
5,Plexus Plastic Cleaner,"I bought this to clean my plastic Strataglass windows on my sailboat and on my Jeep Wrangler. It works wonders. FYI, do not use Pledge on these windows as it will discolor the plastic."
3,"Good product, getting pricey","I have been using this stuff for my Jeep Wrangler plastic windows. It does a good job, but I believe they are pricing themselves out of the market. I use the Honda spray polish on my motorcycle wind shield, and occasionally the dry wash type products. They both do a good job and are alot cheaper in the long run. I might have to start trying them on the Jeep. Plexus came highly recommended, and it works, but my first can was 50% cheaper a few years ago then it is now, and talking to the parts guy at my local motorcycle shop they just got another price increase from their distributor."
3,"Doesn't clean deep, just surface.","I was a bit disappointed in this product, for it didn't clean the dark area of my window. I will need to get a rubbing compound or something else to get that clean. It works ok for maintaining a clean window, but not for deep cleaning."
1,BAD,This stuff was not good at all. It made my car headlights even more yellow ..which we now replaced with new ones this stuff made them so bad.Did nothing for the rear plastic window on our convertible ...Don't waste your money.
5,SUPER PRODUCT,"Have used this on my UTV windshield & head lights, also my new car headlights. Compared to other friends windshield mine has about 90% LESS scratches!!"
2,Too abstract,"After enjoying Marcus Rautman's ""Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire,"" I had high expectations for this Renaissance volume. After reading several chapters, however, I can only say that this volume falls short. The authors' approach is oddly abstract in nature, sticking with generalizations. The sidebar anecdotes they include don't make up for the specifics and examples that should have been part of the main text. I don't feel as if I came away with a vivid picture of what daily life was really like in Renaissance Italy."
5,One of my all-time favorite books,"A wonderful tome by Janice Emily Bowers. These essays combine gardening, ecology and self reflection with a wonderful use of vocabulary. Thoroughly enjoyable; definitely not a one-read book!"
5,Simply brilliant,"The final season is different to the other seasons, a little faster paced as it needed to tie up the storylines as well as having very little of Aileen (due to the actress being pregnant) which was a loss as her issues with drugs was one of the more compelling storylines in this brilliant series.I thought the final season was excellent, it had its drama and action, and we could finally see what people will do to get what they want in life.It is difficult to be specific as it will become spoilers but we see how the two brothers while being polar opposites in their lifestyles and professions are really so similar."
3,Woodworking for dummies.,"It's ""Ok"". some usefull things in there but a lot of bias towards power tools. I've found other books I've liked more."
4,Good Novice Book,"I'm a novice and found lots of help here, BUT this shouldn't be your only resource. I found the recommendations for magazines and other sources in the back of the book to be helpful. You do not need to buy all the power tools mentioned in this book, it is good to know they exist and what they are for. The price is right for this book and there is an Amazon online text available."
5,Informative book,This book helped me with some projects around the house. I loved the illistrations.
3,Only for the most novice of woodworkers,"I've only been woodworking for a few months and am still very much a novice. I bought this book hoping to learn some creative, but easy methods or time saving tips, but as my title implys, this book contains only the most basic of techniques. However, this book is very good for understanding basic terminology. This was my first ""for dummies"" book so maybe I was expecting too much. A few episodes of the New Yankee Workshop and/or a few hours of browsing the internet and you can learn the majority of what this book covers."
5,VERY helpful! Every hiring manager should have it.,"This book has to be the best hiring aid I ever had. I've been using it for over a year and just got two more copies of the new 2nd edition for my department managers. It will help you screen out the dopes and liars, and I tell you this from experience. I could not believe the con games I have uncovered using this book."
5,Another great book.,This is just one of Cassie Edwards's books and like the others it is one that shouldn't be missed. A+++++++
4,Experiencing the Heart of Jesus Leader's Guide,"I am leading a church small group that is studying ""Experiencing the Heart of Jesus"". We chose this book because several members, including myself, have read other Lucado books and liked them. My favorite is ""On the Anvil"". We have just begun the study with the group and I find the Guide helpful in giving me ideas and questions to use in our study. It is more for developing Christians and not scholars, but I find it helpful to revisit basic fundamentals."
2,Helpful but not necessary,"I'm currently teaching this book in a class. I find that occasionally there is something helpful in here but not often. In fact it's been a month since I've even opend it! The majority of what's in this book is the exact same stuff that is in the regular workbook.Just using the regular version of this workbook, not the leaders guide, works just as well."
5,"This is the Real McCoy, deserves 5 stars",Hard to refute this massively documented solidly researched book. This is a MUST READ for anyone trying to weave together the enormous task of trying to understanding the world drug trade. Ditto for all of the other positive reviewers.
3,informative but a long slog!,This is a very comprehensive look into the world of heroin and the links with the CIA.I found it a tough read in the begining as it goes into very much detail about the history and beginings of the heroin trade.All the same a must read when understanding the geo-politcal nature of our world today and how drugs have shaped it.
2,This is not John Hannah's Rebus,"The gentle man on the cover is not John Hannah of The Mummy Fame there is another Rebus which includes author Ian Rankin's Scottish Detective Rebus Hide and Seek, Knots and Crosses and Tooth and Nail are the 2nd, 1st and 3rd books which introduce Rebus. The 1st 3 Scottish TV series were named the same. I first saw them while living in Dundee I'm not sure if this was the first attempt at portraying Rebus but this is not the succesful Scottish TV series like Taggart"
2,This is not the right Rebus,"This is a jolly Rebus without the heft of soul or grittiness needed for true Rebusness. Stott, though he might look the part, is too full of himself, he sports a self-satisfied air that is almost anti-Rebus. The Hannah Rebus is far closer to the real thing plus it has Cafferty. Hannah is perhaps not ideal but he is a good enough actor to pull it off. Skip the Stott and go for the Hannah Rebus. That's my advice."
1,Doesn't hold thick hair,I don't recommend this product if you have thick hair and full of body. I have short to medium length hair and it didn't hold well. The hold lasted a few hours and then just gave out. I've had better hold and structure with cheaper brands at the local drugstore.
5,Great for naturally curly hair,"Bought this for my daughter who has very long, naturally curly hair. This is the only stuff she'll use on her hair..it works great!"
5,Once you get a spade you can never go back,"This is a spade, which is immeasurably better the classic scoop design, and it makes extricating the ice cream from its container much much easier.The liquid core helps cut through very cold ice cream, but also means it cannot go through the dish washer. If you don't wash dishes by hand, you may not want to get this item, but if you do, and your an ice cream fan its a must."
4,Just right,"Perfect for tough ice cream. The handle is a little large, but the spade is great. We really like that it can just ""cut"" right through the ice cream. I also enjoy using it to create ""Cold Stone at Home"" by mashing in mix-ins with the spade. And NO it is not dishwasher safe, if you put it in the dishwasher it will tarnish. So if you don't care about it looking tarnished, wash away, I'm not sure of the long term effect a dishwasher will have on the antifreeze in the handle. If you have already tarnished it and want it to look new again just use some silver polish and it will look great. Great product, we highly recommend it!"
4,Works like a champ,I'd give it 5 stars except that I have to remember to not put it in the dishwasher as the liquid in the handle could explode if exposed to the high temps in a dishwasher. Other than that it is great!
4,useful and informative,"I used the latest edition of this book (published August 2003) while travelling around Sri Lanka for a month in November 2003. I found the information in the book to be accurate and easy to find. Like most Lonely Planet guide books its strength is detailed logistical information such as bus and train times, accommodation and opening times. The only negative point is that sometimes the historical and background information is a little vague and lacks specific dates. Still I would thoroughly recommend this book for any independent traveller in Sri Lanka. It will save you time and money and help you enjoy your holiday even more."
5,RR-QR170 Digital Voice Recorder,"The RR-QR170 Digital Voice Recorder works superbly well, for those people that want to make the transition from traditional tape recorders. Furthermore, it is very small and portable for the ""on the go"" person, without the hassles of having to carry around a tape recorder with several tapes. The menu is very user friendly- in other words you can just start using it without really reading the manual."
5,The best book ever is you are serious about your career!,"This book is the bible for Hollywood! It has everything you need to know about working in this town. Judy shares some valuable knowledge and information. And if you are serious about your career, you must read this book now!"
4,Great book for aspiring actor's in Los Angeles,"I decided not to become an actor in Los Angeles, or aspire to. But I did buy and read this book. It's a great resource for the aspiring actor in Los Angeles. It explains, in detail, pretty much anything and everything you need to know about pursuing a career in acting. It can be overwhelming when you first move to LA. This book helps a lot. I can definitely recommend it if you are serious about becoming an actor."
1,Don't bother...,"This book is one of the more useless books I've bought on the subject. I'd say only about 30% of the book is actually specific to acting in Los Angeles. The rest is general acting and business advice that can be applied in any city (and not all good... aka. onions for fake tears), and anecdotes from the set of Seinfeld. There are some good lists of photographers and training centers, but in general the entire book is written in hard-to-follow bulleted lists. A much better book on the acting business (even for Los Angeles) is An Actor's Business by Andrew Reilly."
5,Buy it now.,"I recently moved to L.A. and bought a used, earlier edition of this wonderful book. When it arrived, the small print and heft of it was intimidating- I was reminded of another famous book, written thousands of years ago?... The paragraph on ""positive"" stories changed my mindset in meetings and two agents offered to sign me the day after I read it. I am convinced this comprehensive guide will shave years off my journey to success. Contacts galore, lists of resources and interviews with everyone you can imagine. I look forward to meeting the author so I can thank her in person."
3,Good book but sadly out of date!,"I own and have read this book as well as the newer follow up (published in 2004).This book is now nearing 15 years old. I read it very recently and began to employ the methods taught in the book. It was not until reading Kurzweil's newest book that I saw he has changed many of his ideas since the writing of this book in 1992-93.For example; in 10%, you should not eat more than 10% of your calories from fat. Carbohydrates are encouraged, sugar is not *that* big of a deal, and caffeine is the enemy. In the new book, fat can be 25% of your calories each day, carbohydrates must now stay very low, sugar is to be avoided at all costs, but caffeine is ok! In fact, the author now drinks 8 cups of green tea per day. Green tea is lower than coffee in caffeine, but 8 cups a day is still a lot of it.I enjoyed reading this book, but I wish I had realized that the information contained within was out of date and no longer to be followed. It would have saved me $20."
5,life-saving diet advice,"You may not like the ideas in here, but if you have diabetes or high cholesterol, this diet could add years to your life. Very readable. I started eating this way, and my blood sugars dropped."
5,Forewarned,Ray Kurzweil writes in a methodical and logical fashion that leads the reader to understand the power of his findings. Our typical American diet is a killer; his 10% Solution is the cure. The hard part is the discipline needed to change our lifetime eating tastes and choices. The avoidance of cancer and heart disease seems worth the effort.
1,doesn't work,"couldn't get it to work at all. After the first time, the computer wouldn't even recognize anything plugged in. Sent it back and bought an ipod (which works)."
5,Acalpulco heat,"The first season of Acalpulco heat is very great.I prefer this season about the second, but it's my choice.I find damage that this DVD isn't in French or subtitle French (Yes I'm French but I loved the TV Show America, consequently I must looked this in VO)I recommanded this DVD, it is very great"
5,acapulco h.e.a.t is great,"i love the show. the actors, scenery, fighting are beautiful. holly floria, alison armitage, and catherine oxenburg are not only beautiful but intelligent women. even though it is only a tv show it makes you think if there are any special agencies helping the gov't."
4,Fun and entertaining,"Truly one of those one hit wonders that were fun in the '90s. Great cast that you don't see any more. Fun plot lines (including the ""Manchurian Candidate"" copy). And I still really like the main theme song. Silly, but with a great beat."
3,A good inroduction to 7 Keto DHEA,"I think the title is a little misleading. The book is a good overview of DHEA and it's metabolites, but the title implies a more diverse subject matter (anti-aging). Nice to know, however, that there is a ""safer"" way to use DHEA for those of us that want the health benefits without risk of conversion to androgens or estrogen."
5,"Magical, wonderful book!","I first read this book as pre-veterinary student and have read it again and again, finding it more and more enjoyable as I advance in my veterinary education. I was and am delighted that the veterinary profession is featured in a work of fantasy fiction in such a realistic and positive fashion. I enjoy the 'scientific' approach of the students to the the various magical species they encounter, some very real ethical challanges (I am thinking specifically of the difficult labors of the mare, and later the centaur). I strongly recommend this book first to pre-vet student, vet students, and veterinarians, then to any reader of fine fantasy. This is truly a great read!"
3,"Disgusting, yet strangely attractive","Nick O'Donohoe has a unique talent, for after reading this book I said to myself that I will never open it... Only to keep returning to it again and again. The fairy tale it is, a beautiful fairy tale of satyrs and unicorns, werewolves and griffins, but a fairy tale told with many details, so realistic, so truthful. People often forget how bloody fairy tales usually get, though... On the whole, it is much better than the second book of the very same series, ""Under The Healing Sign"", which made me wish to commite suicide immediately upon reading the last chapter of it."
3,decent some times cut it,"Alright I read a lot and I love fantasy but this was borderline bad/good. Where the Ideas were Really great and had such potential it really didn't get there. It felt as if they chopped this book apart and skipped a lot witch can leave one confused. I had to reread some parts several times just to realize what was happening. Then when I did it was good, but then they called something by one name then another witch was fine but, stop going back and forth stick with one. I know if your working on becoming a Vet this would probably be much much better, but for us who aren't please just put a glossary or something at the back so we know a bit. I still liked it, it had good potential but it was obviously rushed."
3,no map!,"i am disappointed there is no map in this book, not even any maps showing where the T stops are in relation to the sites or even where family friendly restaurants are in relation to the sites. it even mentions things to do on cape cod and in salem and plimoth with no mention of how far that is from the city of boston. other than that, the book is helpful in determining what to do in boston with kids, but frustrating in that it will take a whole other book to figure out HOW to get there!"
2,Nothing New To Say,"This book is nothing more than a re-hash of things from other books. A large portion of this book is nothing more than quotes from the book ""The forgotten Soldier"" by Guy Sajer. Interspersed is the authors ""opinion"" of what the various quotes mean. Not very historical if you ask me. All in all, it is just barely interesting, and also one of the least informative that I've ever read."
2,very average,If you have read The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer and Soldat by Siegfried Knappe then forget this one. I gave up half way throught. Nothing new here.
3,thought provoking but could have used better editing,Fritz's study of the German infantry soldier was very moving. When you read about the day to day activities it makes you realize the hardship that a front line soldier goes through. My big complaint with the book was the several repeated quotes that appear. I think a little better editing would have made this book more enjoyable.
1,Utter Disappointment,"Fritz breaks the most elementary rules of scholarly writing by quoting the same references several times in a row. It wouldn't be so bad, if he wasn't quoting the fictional FORGOTTEN SOLDIER. Fritz adds nothing new to the discussion of German soldiers in WW II. SOLDAT is an excellent book, as other reviewers have mentioned. FRONTSOLDATEN is simply a collection of quotes from dubious sources - and all secondary ones at that. Fritz does not appear to have conducted a single interview on his own. How then can he claim to have any kind of grasp on the material? Anyone who describes this book as ""scholarly"" doesn't know the first thing about historical research. Fritz didn't research this book - he cribbed it. Spend your money elsewhere. For the English speaking world, we still have to wait for a definitive book on the Landser. ..."
1,The book of quotes,"Imagine writing a book by simply stringing quotes and references together with your literary contribution limited to connecting verbs and you have this book in a nutshell!Maybe I would have liked it if the author had titled it, Frontsoldaten: The book of quotes."
2,"Too simple, too short.",Not enough information on pipe smoking and/or about tobacco and pipes. Try to be funny and do not convey all needed or desired information.
5,movie of memories,"I bought this movie, for my husband who was a pilot in the airforce flew some of the back grown scenes, It's a small scene, but he's there.I also was a great fan of Spencer Tracey and Van Johnson in my days"
4,What airplae stuff,"I thought the P-38s were great. I know the special effects were not up to current par, but the moview was made ove sixty years ago. I thought the acting was very good."
3,Ooop!! My BAD!!,"Thought I had ordered a DVD ... this was a VHS! Don't even have anything to play it on, so I have no clue if it even works. I guess it would be OK if I could play it. <<Shrugs>> It is a great story."
3,I liked it at first,"When the book started it was ok, but from there it went to a man sharing three women, who didn't have any problems with sharing the same man. Most readers will probally enjoy, but it just wasen't my cup of tea."
1,2Disapointed,"Received a clock, which wouldn't run. Received a replacement, and it wouldn't run. Was told I would get a credit for this, but haven't received it."
3,"OK clock for the wife, but couldn't take hitting the floor",My wife smacked this off the night stand one too many times... but she liked it until it gave up the ghost. :-)
1,Big Ben 2000 Baby Ben Deluxe Clock,My mother was not please with this clock at all. She said they just don't make them like they use too. The purchase and delivery of the clock were up to the excellent service provided by Amazon.com. Will continue to order from this website in the future.
2,Doesn't keep time,"Clock doesn't keep the proper time, have changed the batteries & still doesn't work right - not worth paying the shipping to return"
1,hard to wind,"I bought this for my Mother to replace her old baby ben. She could not wind it and gave it to me. I rarely use it because it is a ""pain"" to wind."
3,Big Bend gift,This was a gift for a coworker who loves her clock as she like the old fashion kind. yes I would recomend
4,Growing up North & Growing up South,"I bought the book expecting a clash between characters reflecting the liberal north and the conservative south of the 60s through today. Was surprised at the actual reversal of roles. The book operates on several levels. First, there is the evolution of the main characters over time. Quite interesting in itself. Second, there is the interaction of the main characters and supporting casts from 1969 to the present. A study of enduring friendship. Third, is a somewhat choppy backdrop of how the above two fit in recent history and the regions.Defintiely worth the read - a unique journey.A bit uneven and patchy in some aspects - seems to result from the reliance on the actual letters between Ruth and Jeff, supplimented with some annotation, and essays to fill in the gaps - several of which went unfilled."
2,The Dulling of the Sixties,"This unremarkable book, allegedly a shared passage from the sixties, is ridden with cliched writing, and is also a structural nightmare. The idea of dual narrators contrives to give the book a ragged quality (especially when neither writer is very good and their prose lacks sparkle). Worse, though, is how they can make so mundane the late sixties and early seventies, vital periods in American life. They missed so much it makes the reader wonder if they were playing in the shallows while deeper events were taking place, quite unnoticed, all around them. Not very perceptive, not very interesting."
2,Too slow paced ...,"I thought Jeff's writings were very good but Ruth's were boring and difficult to get through. I skipped most of hers. The concept of the story is great but the pace is too slow and it didn't hold my intererst, but I did manage to get through the whole thing."
4,Good Reading,"I was delighted to get a gift of this book from a friend. I was in Vietnam as a medic and missed some of the time the book covers, so I had a sense of discovering something fresh. I enjoyed this story of two people making it through the times back then, and being friends for so long. I guess what is best about this book is the direct way it is written. It's nothing fancy, just straight, by two honest people. They each take turns telling their story - of growing up and going to college and getting involved in the screwed-up politics of the seventies and generally just getting through. It's a good read."
2,Donna,"While I have just begun to enjoy this tremendous work that came highly recommended to me, I am already somewhat disappointed in the limited, male-oriented, patriarchal interpretation of some indisputably feminine symbols like the Minoan Great Mother Goddess referenced and pictured under the entry, AXE on page 16. Described as a 'phallic' representation of her 'parthenogenetic fertility,' and as a, 'Solar emblem of the 'sky gods,' and later as an, 'emblem of Saint John the Babtist,' this is clearly a female iconic Goddess figure holding a double-sided LABRYS (axe) in each upraised arm. The Labrys is a feminine symbol associated with the female Amazons that were Priestesses of Artemis, the Moon Goddess. During their time, lunar energies were associated with the Goddess, and feminine power, NOT masculine, phallic, sky-Gods."
3,An Illustrated Encyclopaedia ofTtraditional Symbols,I was looking for a large volume of symbols to get some tattoo ideas from. This wasn't it. I saw some illustrations but not enough. In fact I was expecting more ideas to draw upon There were very few.
3,Perfect for Kids,High quality movies? No. Perfect for silly kid fun? Yes.Good deal if you have young ones (not easily scared).
5,Bangin' cd!,"I'm not really into southern rap, but Trip's lyrics and flow are like none other. This dude is on point and representin' Christ to the fullest. This is the first cd in which I have liked EVERY single song on the album...check it out.Support Reach and Cross Movement."
4,My favorite trip lee album,"I have all of trip lee's albums and this album is still my favorite (Good Life is also really good). I can listen to this album all the way through, no skips. Well worth the purchase."
5,take a trip with lee,"if you love rap or hiphop you will love this cd. I appreciate his heartfelt dedication to the Lord and the supremacy but he really did make an awesome album from a musical standpoint.my favs would have to be ""cash or Christ"" and ""behold the Christ""even just the titles are enough to make one think about how you are living your life. I mean, who ARE you rollin' with??"
1,Just Horrible,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. Dissapointing doesn't do it justice. I agree with the reader who said it was as if Harris just wrote this because they wanted a sequel. He shouldn't have bothered. Should have left well enough alone. This story just didn't work. From the beginning where the FBI brass abandon Starling, a bona fide hero, after the fatal shooting of a female drug dealer to the idiotic revenge plotted by one of Hannibal's victims, to the unbearably ridiculous ending, this was a book that should never have been written. Harris should of left us with the ending of ""Silence"" and our imaginations. I never even bothered to see the movie since the film adaptation is usually inferior to the novel (however it's hard to see how in this case ). This book was so bad that I wanted a refund even though I had gotten a free copy."
4,Lovable stick pony for small toddler,"This is the shortest-handled stick pony we were able to find, and was an instant hit with a tiny two-year-old (31"" tall) who loves ponies. After just one demonstration on how to ""gallop"" with the horse, she was off and riding. The pony is ideally sized, has a sound chip in its ear that makes ""clip-clop"" and ""neighing"" sounds when you squeeze the ear. Also doubling nicely as a toy broom when held upside down!"
5,Freshwater pearl necklace,I bought this necklace to replace one I lost some time ago. It's so beautiful. Well made. Nice weight. The one I lost was purchased at a jewelery store and it's hard to tell the difference between the two.
3,ACEPTABLE,"Esperaba mas de este CD. Algunas pistas han sido REMASTERIZADAS y otras son versiones nuevas (ej: Mi tristeza es mia y nada mas). Leonardo Favio sigue siendo uno de mis cantantes favoritos, pero estoy acostumbrado a las grabaciones originales."
3,So-so,Bought this for my 6-year old to bring on an overnight camping trip. It's OK - not very bright but then what did I expect from a little flashlight - and the LED ligths on the side provided 20 seconds worth of enjoyment to my daughter but that's about it.
3,Great light but,I love these lights from my son. Very ambient but for somereason he likes his little earlight thing from my husband.Blue Led Earlight Flashlight (hands free light) [...]
4,"A little expensive, but cute","I didn't like paying $[...] (x three kids) for these, but they really did like playing with them in the camper. The lightshow is just four different colored lights on the side which blink but when we hung them all up in the camper at once for bedtime the kids really enjoyed it."
2,Not an LED (sorta),"While the side lights are LED, the main flashlight isn't. I specifically bought this for the LED feature and longer battery life. I was bummed to learn it was a conventional light."
2,Don't drop these!,The flash light is 'cool' for an older child(5 & up)because you have tiny movements on the switch button that is hard to control with 'little fingers'! Now...if dropped(like my grandson did)look to see if the bulb inside(the bright one)is still intact or broke. His little flashlight bulb broke. I would look for a CHILD FLASHLIGHT that has a long time reputation!
5,Helps to condition my scalp..,"It soothes my dry scalp..and melts so easily while using it. My hairs grows very fast, it helps to moisturize my scalp and it's very light. Just use it lightly and massage into the scalp. Can be used daily I don't get a build up. It's my favorite scalp conditioner."
4,Great for your scalp,I like applying this product to my scalp but not my hair. It smeels soooo good. It is too greasy to put on my hair. I don't like how it feels when i leave it on my hair.I would recommend this product to anyone.
5,I love the smell,"This stuff, has grown my hair and gives my hair that condition that I need daily, and this stuff smells great."
2,Ok at best; get Shaeffer's guide instead,"This is a terse book, nice and colourful but really not indispensible. Get Claire Shaeffer's Fabric Sewing Guide instead which really is encyclopedic. Unfortunately both suffer from not having things like cross-names (parachute cloth = supplex) but Fabric Savvy is just a little too brief and does not totally handle all the problems in sewing for that particular fabric like Shaeffer's does (it's a 4th the size).Also Fabric Savvy covers of course allot less different fabrics batching them together and ignoring the nuances."
1,I can't review the item if I don't receive it!!!,I still have not recieved the item ordered on 2/28 and today is 3/31. I will be waiting and not placing any more orders from there!!!!!!!!!!
5,Love it!,"I'm a new sewer and find myself referencing this book all the time when I'm using a new fabric. It's amazingly complete! I just finished my first project in velvet and it went very smoothly, thanks to the tips from this book. I would have been fighting with the fabric forever if I'd just followed the pattern instructions."
5,A must have for anyone who sews!,"This is the most informative book I have found. Whatever fabric you are sewing with Sandra gives you all the information you need...how to prepare your fabric before sewing with it, what type of needle to use, what length inseam, how to press, what type of foot to use, etc etc. A must have for any type of sewer!"
1,Alphabetical Abboration,"The only thought that this book has is what comes after A, then B, then, etc... then forgets that there is a Z. Come on, I could have goten this info from Wikipedia, heck, they probably have even more.The subtitle of this book should be; ""What They Don't Want You To Know""...is that this book is crap.If you buy this book, you are wasting your money. You should not even order this book if it were free, with free shipping, and if for some reason you stole it, give it back because not to would not only prove that you are a dumb thief, but can't read either."
1,I expected more,"All this book is, is an alphabetical listing of different societies, Illuminati, Mafia, etc. It was a disappointment. If you want to read this book, get it at the library because it isn't worth buying. You'd probably be better off reading an Encyclopedia of Secret Societies as this is pretty much what this book is."
2,What's the point?,"First off, let me say I love this band. And that /Colossal Head/ is definitely _not_ uneven, rather one of their best.That being said, I don't understand The Ride. None of the re-done tunes are worth a fiddler's finger, IMO. The new material is good, there's just not enough of it. /Wreck of the Carlos Rey/ is killer, but it sounds more like a Richard Thompson track than LL, not that that's bad.And what were they thinking keeping that atrocious version of /Matter of Time/? Costello can't be blamed for having a terrible voice, but why use that horrid track?All in all, I think I need to subtract another star."
3,Not sure where else to ask this??,Why do People say that Colossal Head is uneven? It is one of their best efforts.I think it is their best.A fantastic recording.Every song is great.I can listen to it for a week at a time.Not so sure of The Ride though?Already stored away in the cd case
2,Beware...,"I LOVE Los Lobos. I've got most of their albums, and have seen them live several times. This album, however, is unlike any of their others. It lacks the drive, spirit, and intensity that they usually have. It's interesting music, but if you're looking for LOS LOBOS music, you should look elsewhere first. The Ride just isn't representative of their sound."
3,Driven Los Lobos - but doesn't stand out,"Maybe it was my mood when i have listened to this CD but it doesn't seem like Los Lobos best. It misses the personalistic touch that touches me on their other works.It is driven and has a frantic beat but not my cup of tea as far as Lobos music goes. Try Neighborhood, Kiko, This Time and many others for real Lobos treats."
5,Top-notch soulful bluesy rocker,"The Ride is an excellent follow up to the masterful Good Morning Atzlan. Los Lobos have been absolutely on fire lately and The Ride is a great testament to that fact. Everything you could possibly want is here. This CD burns. You can feel it in your bones and in your soul. The production and sound of the thing are really, really good, very warm and rich sounding, somewhere between the adventurous Kiko and the previously mentioned GMA.There are some fantastic new songs (La Venganza de Los Pelados & Rita are personal favorites) as well as some fun and interesting remakes of already familiar LL material. Throw in some guest artists that understand what these guys are all about and you have my new favorite CD."
5,it grew on me,"I wasn't sure about it at first but I loaded it on my iPod and I've realized that many of the songs I keep going back to are from this album. chains of love, Rita, Somewhere in Time are all great songs. I love the blues feeling that Chains gives. It took some time but now I love it and prob more than some of there earlier stuff."
1,Don't waste your time!!!!,"It should have been called ""Cheaters ALMOST Uncensored"" Try Cheaters Uncensored 4. That's the only real uncensored one."
4,better than the movie,"This book has over 100 black and white pictures from behind the scenes of the film. There are very detailed chapters about Sweethaven, the characters, and the special effects. There are even some song lyrics. This book is worth buying."
4,Lovely Rise in Lovely DVD,"Every moment of these historic Ris Stevens telecasts from ""The Voice of Firestone"" is a pleasure to hear. Stevens' beautiful voice shines, caresses and seduces the listener. True, this are not restored footage; however, when one overlooks this, a very lovely program is at hand to be savored."
2,Interesting historic recording,"Rise Stevens was a very good singer. The problem with this DVD (which is of TV broadcasts of the early 1950s) is that television at that time was rather crude by todays standards (both audio & video) and this DVD does not seem to be technically updated. Also, like many opera singers, she was much better in the arias than the songs. However, it is interesting to see the kind of programs available on comercial TV back then."
1,Plenty of nothing.....,"Ms. Collins seems to think she has reinvented the wheel in this account. In what can only be described as a gross oversimplification of the treatment and recovery of anorexia nervosa. By stating that she never gave Olympia the choice whether or not to comply. If curing anorexia was as simple as making the sufferer eat, the hospital programs would be more effective when they refeed patients. I was disappointed in what could have been an interesting book."
1,Not very helpful,"This book, while the story is admirable, did not provide any significant help for our family that has a young child with an eating disorder. I was looking for an evidence based and thoughtful guideline to help us, which this is most definitely NOT. Instead, it is a rant against society and the medical community. Instead, I would recommend ""How to help your teenager beat an eating disorder"" which is written by knowledgable medical experts."
4,A good review of how the Maudsley Method can work.,"This author recounts the horror of first recognizing that her daughter had anorexia, then that traditional medical treatment is tragically flawed.Her attitude and stories are not always endearing, but the narrative is very close to home and I know what she was going through. We purchased this book along with about seven others as my daughter was spiraling down with anorexia. We fully committed ourselves to the Maudsley method and have had tremendous success.I also suggest the excellent Help Your Teenager Beat An Eating Disorder by James Lock as a more clinically relevant starting point."
5,Fantastic,"Crystal Gayle is just amazing. Really enjoy listening to her. If you love songs with meaning you will love this. Great voice, she is one of the best."
5,Nobody better than Crystal Gayle,"Although it's not a complete hits set, I'm still giving this 5 stars because there are so many great songs here.Without a doubt, Crystal is the most underrated country female artist today. She rarely gets any recognition on country radio stations, GAC, or CMT. Yet, this talented woman had two very successful decades of consistent hits, including 18 #1 hits.What was so great about Crystal was that she didn't see country radio as having restraints. She introduced country audiences to all kinds of sounds and styles of music. The best thing about buying a Crystal album was that you never got the same kind of songs as the previous one. You were always going to be pleasently surprised. What a talent this lady is.This set covers mostly her 70s hits, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. What Crystal fans are waiting for though is a complete boxed set or maybe re-issues of all her albums. Until then, this is a great set of some of Crystal's bests songs."
5,Dvd,"Fast, great quality and prices! Kids loved the videos! Very impressed with how quickly we received them! Thanks so much!"
4,"It's Elementary, Sort Of","This show has great charm, and brings Sherlock Holmes to an interesting, if not always *entirely* believable, future time of England. I enjoy the characters and their interactions, seeing the cases present themselves and become solved, and the twists and turns within each episode. Nothing new hat, but still well done.However, I wouldn't recommend this show for everyone. It can feel corny sometimes, and the animation is occasionally buggy or (specifically during the few CGI segments) somewhat repetitive. While not a pain to watch, it can become slightly distracting while watching. But for a Saturday morning cartoon on DVD, it's a pleasant watch and enjoyable in its own right."
3,not as fun as I remembered,"I remember originally watching this series because of the Sherlock Holmes angle. I must have liked it back then because I was happy to see that it was available on DVD. As for now...it's still a better cartoon than others of that era, but the female character Lestrad is the stereotypical strident ""lone wolf"" cop in an outfit Barbie would love, with a stupid Captain in charge. Her character was irritating, but after the first few episodes I did enjoy the stories more. It was fun to find out the voice of Sherlock Holmes was Lt Randy Disher! (Monk)If you are forgiving of Lestrad, and chalk it up to 1990's imported programming, it's not a bad way to spend some Saturday mornings.Also, the only extras are previews of some really, really awful cartoons from the same production company. Ugh."
4,sherlock holmes,i bought this item because i have read all of the stories and have seen all the movies including the remakes with robert downey jr. i also enjoyed the series
1,BEWARE SCRATCHES,WAITED TOO LONG TO FINALLY PLAY THIS SET............THE DISCS HAVE SCRATCHES..CAN'T RETURN....DON'T BUY. THESE ARE FROM MILL CREEK.........THE JUNK PEOPLE! THAT'S WHY IT WAS $8.00............
1,Please pass the Tums,"I discovered this band and I share common origin in Bastrop, Louisiana. So I bought the album blind to see how a band from my hometown might sound. I'm a musical omnivore and willing to listen to almost anything once.This, and another album, ""Exclamationaire"", are the worst dreck I ever heard. The band's development was obviously arrested in early adolescence. If there had been more support for little league baseball or the Bastrop mill had provided enough jobs this mess would not have been necessary. The music expresses the full range of emotion from III.2.c to III.2.d, which is the embarrassingly strident demand for attention from the children of parents who cling to guns and religion. Unfortunately that's not the stuff that leads to good opera. Louisiana's giant contribution to American music is diminished by this racket. Don't waste your money, don't encourage these dweebs."
5,I hope this works.,"A good, if obscure, series of children's books for those who are looking for something to fill the void of 'I already read narnia, and potter, and the SOUE, and etc.' The christian messagery is pretty thick, whether it's something you wish to encourage or avoid, but the books are pretty good on their own merit. Discussing the books while reading them would be enough to reenforce or negate them, depending on what is said. The stories are intricate and well written enough to keep an adult reader entertained as well.The only detraction would be that it has an awfully familiar feel after reading enough children's fantasy."
4,Political Intrigue in New Hampshire,"The Lewis Cole series is very well writen and among my favorites. This one takes place during the presidential primaries amd with the exception of one highly unlikely circumstance is an excellent mystery. Lewis Cole is very capable and believable and he like the series moves up and down the small New Hampshire coast combining mystery and tourism and entertaining us every step of the way. If you haven't already fallen in love with the New Hampshire coast, read this and the other novels in the series and you will. My only complaint is the disguising of the names of the towns and beaches. As a former resident of New Castle, New Hampshire, I find this a little distracting. Hopefully, others will not."
3,unconvincing,"I enjoyed Primary Storm right up to the solution. Although Cole and his friend Felix are, to my mind, a bit of a cliche (Disappointed Reclusive Man and Good Badguy Buddy) the story was interesting and kept me turning pages, and the writing was pretty good (although Cole's girlfriend Annie came off like she was maybe 22 years old at most). My real issue, however, is the solution -- it's just not remotely believable."
1,A waste of time and money,"Unfortunately, you don't get even one full song played by Mayall on this DVD.I don't have any complaints about the cinematic aspect, but what a disappointment it was not to have him play in concert. The entire DVD plays ""California"" in the background, whetting your appetite for ANY full performance, but to no avail."
2,For completists only!!,I have been a Mayall fan for 35 years. Don't waste your money on this one. Buy the 70th birthday concert DVD instead.Not much about the Turning Point as such. If you expect some detailed information on this classic album then you will be disappointed.The other irritation is the repetition of footage between the two features on this DVD.I'll sell my copy on ebay.
5,An Iran which has long gone but still is,"Terence O'Donnell provides a wonderful account of his experiences in rural Iran of the 1960s. His open-minded approach to a foreign world, makes for a nostalgic reflection of a culture which has changed considerably since the revolution. Although it would be difficult to find the life that surrounded the Garden of the Brave in War in today's Iran, it is suprising how much of O'Donnell's tales is reflected by many Iranians to this day."
3,Garden of the Brave in War,The story rings true; the author's interpretation of the events and Iranians' behavior sounds patronizing and mildly insulting.
5,A Lost World,"O'Donnell's ""Garden of the Brave in War"" is a lovely lost gem of a travel memoir-- his account of his time on a farm in northern Iran in the 1960s. It's elegant, delightful, sad, and engrossing. It's also about a lost world-- Iran a decade or so before the Revolution, an Iranian countryside still only dimly aware of ""modernization"", where politics-- if anyone notices at all --are local and tribal, where the author is not an infidel or a ""Westerner"", but rather seen by the locals as a hapless city dweller who needed to be gently taught about country life. O'Donnell conjures up visions of a lost time and place-- the Iran where he spent fifteen years, an Iran far removed from the ominous place it seems in 2007 --and tells a lovely sad story. This is one of those forgotten books I'm glad to be able to recommend."
3,Cheaters Vol.5 Review,"The Best of Cheaters Volume 7 UncensoredGood ,but not as good as predecessor too hot for tv."
5,Betty Boop placemats,"I really like the placemats. They are good quality, pretty and easy to keep clean."
5,The story finally gets in motion,"Finally, this is the point where the Outlaw Star really gets down and dirty. First, the OS makes a pitstop at a city to get some money. Gene is after a guy named Zomba who is worth 10000 WONGS! Gene kills him pretty quickly, but he only killed the android, so he gets a small 2000 Wong. Suzuka ended up killing Zomba and got the 10000 Wong all for herself. Greddy little...moving along. The crew of the OS arrives at Heyfong. Gene wants to enter the space race to get some cash and to take out the MacDougal brothers who are also in the race. Gene gets sponsorship from Fred and the OS is in the race. Another participant in this race is also the arrogant Aisha Clan Clan. The episode ends with OS in the race with a no-escape situation. The dub may not be the best at all parts, but it works. The animation wasn't really the best with a poorly drawn hall scene, but it still rocks. Overall, an ok tape and a nice addition to the long line of Outlaw Star tapes."
4,"Finally, a book devoted to boat maintenance.",The people at International Marine know a subject that was in desperate needed of a book. This book not only describes methods to keep your boat looking great but also names names! It provides the brand names you can buy from your local marine store. This is a must buy for any boater's library.
2,Sticky sweet!,"Ultra-sentimental tale of farm life. The author swings between complete unreality (the sheep Biddy is given very unsheeplike qualities, maybe she should have been named ""Lassie""?) and passages of very well-written & realistic observation (the lambs-at-play passages are excellent & spot-on.)If you don't know anything about farm animals you may enjoy this story; if you are a farmer(particularily a sheep farmer) you will say ""Hold on a minute!"" numerous times.The illustrations are lovely; a redeeming feature.To recap: rather cloyingly sweet & a tear-jerker to boot. Don't quote any of the sheep or wolf ""facts"", this is definitely a fictional tale."
5,Great Sandals,I have owned these sandals for two years now and wear them with just about everything. They are comfortable and timeless. I get tons of compliments every time I wear them.
3,More exact indexing,I find that the 2 ball bearings don't always fall in their seating pockets leaving the plate a few mm from a full index rotation. Usually remedied by a gentle touch or placing the next case in the plate.
5,Excellent and well-worth reading,"This book is enlightening and encouraging. I agree with the reviewer who says that the information is based on sound scientific research. (See Dr. Russel Reiter's book, ""Melatonin,"" for example, which is highly scientific.) From personal experience of watching our pet with cancer improve after starting on melatonin, we're convinced of its merits. The tone may be enthusiastic, but melatonin is a natural substance which cannot be patented, so the author has nothing to gain financially from the sale of melatonin."
5,The Melatonin miracle,Melatonin is truly a miracle hormone. I really needed it as mine was so low due to my advanced age. I now sleep like a baby and I know my thymus and adrenals are functuring better.
3,"reads like an ""info-mercial"",","i liked the book and found the information in it very interesting but i felt as if the author was trying to ""sell"" melatonin as opposed to ""selling"" his research. this made me feel uncomfortable and suspicious much the same way an info-mercial does when over excited people try and convince you about ""revolutionary"" discoveries"
1,This is a dangerous book.,"Melatonin is not a miracle. It is a hormone whose secretion governs your circadian rythm. In other words, it makes you sleepy at night, when your body naturally generates it.Taking melatonin to improve your skin tone, and use it as an all around fountain of youth miracle drug is nonsense. The more melatonin you take, the more you screw up your internal hormonal secretion of melatonin.Also, the dosage recommended are far higher than what is prudent to take.Whenever someone touts something as a miracle it is always too good to be true. This book is certainly no exception."
3,Max Unlocks the Universe,"I found this book difficult to follow at times. As a result, I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped."
5,A COSMIC MYSTERY FOR SPACE AND TIME,"Max is back-and it's about time. Well, actually it's about murder and mayhem and space and time and anything else you might want to find in a well-written mystery.Young computer geeks are dying-well before their time-and ex-FBI agent, Private Eye Max Austin gets involved. To solve the case, and try to save a few lives, Max has to get up to speed on the latest trends in computers and programming. He enlists an old friend, Marisol, to get him into the loop, and she adds a bunch of complications to the case--and to Max's life.There are lots of great twists and turns, leads and misleads, a bit of traveling around the country tracking down clues, and even a bit of the ol' down and dirty with fists and guns. Max may be a bit past his prime, and even a bit gimpy, but when the goin' gets tough...Highly recommended..."
3,So-So!,nothing new& they added commercials to the DVD--what poor taste! down-right tacky! I love the show but they could do better for the price & add more shows!
1,JUST STUPID,"Disastrous! This guy is a complete loser. Legalized drugs and prostitution, no border enforcement. Won't own up to racist newsletters written in his name. Rick Santorum 2012."
1,Ron Paul,"Ron Paul is an antisemite and racist. Read his newsletters (well maybe not), that he says he didn't write but just put his name on. Who puts out news letters and doesn't read them. The man is dangerous and should be sent back to wherever he came from."
1,Pyrite,"Ron Paul is pyrite. For the non-mineralists out there, that's false-gold. Ron Paul is one-hundred percent false in his approach to the protection of wealth. He would simply let Ahmadinijhad have it all."
1,Poorly written book,We do not have currently enough gold and enough proven reserve of gold to support the case stated in this book. This book is out of the mainstream of economic thought to the extent that it can be such. All the economists I read have contrary views to those espoused in this treatise.This book is a horrible book.
1,"Gold Yes. Ron Paul, Absolutely NOT.","Ron Paul is a complete idiot, which makes me wonder whether the Gold Standard is actually the right way to go. Knowing that Ron Paul supports the return to the gold standard makes me question my own strongly held beliefs about the Fed and the gold standard. Anything that Ron Paul supports becomes for me something I need to question because he is such an IDIOT."
1,Overrated,Nothing particularly revolutionary here. If Ron Paul was truly interested in success he would unite the libertarian and republican forces into a block which could achieve real revolution in politics rather than languishing at 1% support perpetually.
5,Great Book,"Ron Paul is the man and really knows what's up. What a great book, thank you!After reading this book, I have converted from supporting Obama and now support Ron Paul. What was I thinking? Spending is not the answer. Fiscal conservatism is."
1,crackpot,think twice about supporting this man. he is not america's friend. he is dangerous to our national security! surely you can find something better to spend your hard-earned money on!
4,the case for gold,the best explanation of what money is that I have ever read. my feeling is that this book should be reqquired reading for high school students in order to graduate
3,Graphs hard to read,The information is good. It is worth at least the $.01 that you need to pay for the kindle price. But the graphs are hard to read-especially the Dec 1971-Dec 1981 consumer price index. The chart is not lined up and not on the same page. This is OFTEN a problem with kindle books. I hope kindle can fix this. This was a problem with another kindle book that I paid over $10 for -The Silver Bomb.
1,And I LIKE Ron Paul!!!!!!!!!,"Aside from the fact that you cannot physically get gold out of the ground fast enough to match the productivity that happens in the world . . . aside from the fact that there is no reasonable economist that agrees with him on the left or the right . . . aside from the fact that this book has small print, a repetitive theme, very little facts from modern economic Nobel Prize winners and aside from the fact that Ron Paul has no education or research to support his claims . . . aside from all that, this is a good book.Oh, I forgot to mention . . it's boring as heck. But aside from all that this is goo. . . well decent. . . well no it's a pretty bad book.Sorry Paul, I support you, but this is a terrible book."
1,Paul is Wrong on Gold,"As per usual, Ron Paul is a quack.The United States went to a fiat currency for a reason: limiting how much money you can have by tacking it to the price of gold artificially forced the economy to be smaller than it actually was. By going to a fiat currency the amount of currency in the economy could be made to match properly.HOWEVER it's true that the fed printing money is a serious problem. But there has to be a medium between alcoholism and prohibition. There aren't just to extreme sides of the coin."
1,The Case For Mold,This book is so bad that it should be left in the rain and left to grow mold! The ideas ard bad and many of the word are missspelled.
5,The case for sound money.,"Ron Paul is, as always, brilliant. In this book, Dr. Paul gives you the history of currency in our colonies and how they made the most logical decision for the definition of the dollar. It is a must read considering just how much money the Fed prints every year."
2,"I'm a Huge Ron Paul fan, but.......","....this book is a disappointment, to say the least. It is boring and has several grammatical errors. More than one reference is vague with statements starting with, ""as one historian noted..."".When there is a discussion of inflation and deflation, I feel as though mixed messages are being sent about the dangers of both, but the explanations aren't detailed enough to give me the kind of understanding I need to know why deflation, for example, would be bad for an economy. The only conclusion I can make is that if someone was holding inventory he had bought for $2 and now can only competitively sell it for $1, it may lead to the closing of his business. But is this conclusion correct relating to the message in this book, or is there more to the case for gold than I'm picking up?"
4,Good value for cheap cartridges,"This is a good value for cheap cartridges. Good for draft copies, not much else."
2,12 cringing classics,"if you want a laugh and see how things were done way back when you cannot go wrong with this collection.some are genuine classic's and others are just classic stuff.one thing with my box i got three discs yet the description on the web page states four discs,cannot see how they got four when all appears on 3.but again my box was missing one disc but replaced with anotheri got=the house on haunted hill=the last man on earth=dementia 13=phantom from 10,000 leagueswere i should have gotthe giant gila monsterthe fatal hourdead men walkthe mad monsteri don't mind getting another disc but i have 3 out of the 4 on other discs.thats the only problem that i found with the box set.have fun,enjoy and have a good laugh,remember that years ago these were scary,and in years to come the exocist will be a joke.martin"
5,Great pen - fast delivery,"I am extremely pleased with this pen. Given the original price and what you can buy it for now, WOW.. The pen feels wonderful, writes nicely and the box is classy.The pen was delivered super fast and I cannot say enough nice things about this product and purchase experience."
5,Bought two of these,"Style, weight, ""feel"" ... got em ... price is excellent for quality writing instrument ... sure i might have gone to this vendor's ""popular auction site"" but I came back and bought other Tourneau from here ... again quality pen and quality price."
3,Great for Easter Actvities,"A good book for children, the story is not much of a story, but there's lots of great easter things to do, and it tells a bit about the easter symbols and their meanings."
2,Get the original on this one too!!!,"This version is still a lame American version, Dubbing is still horrible as we can say ""rush job"". Alot of original music has been cut. Since I said the dubbing is horrible on this, the scenes aren't even worth watching. What ever you do do not buy unoriginal versions."
3,Dixon & Webb,"I was ever swo pleased to be able to find a copy of this book (used) at a reasonable price and in ""good"" condition. It is an excellent text on enzymology. I received it in short time and am very grateful. Thank you."
2,slow moving,"I was expecting a lot more from this movie, having read a review that stated it was a great movie. It was very long and did not hold my interest. Dirty Dancing was a lot better."
3,Good sad movie,"This movie is a good story, especially if you like the Catskill Mountains in New York and its storied hotel history, or grew up there. But be warned, it is very very sad in the ending."
5,Health Care Models Revisited,"Competing Solutions is an excellent review about real-world comparative international health care models of delivery and financing. Also, it is worth reading the chapter 7 on The Theory of Managed Competition because one can find clearly explained definitions and the core principles of this controversial theme. Joseph White shows that he is one of the main experts on this fascinating area of debate. One of his phrases: ""If Americans must choose between narrower benefits for everybody and wider benefits for some, the choice is clear: cover everyone"".(see page 274)"
4,A fine choice.,"I purchased this item 2 weeks ago and am very happy with it. The screen is very sharp and clear, the sound through the speakers is adequate.I haven't tried it with earphones yet. My only complaint is that it does indeed make some loud noises when you first put in the DVD, but it is quiet once it is playing. There was an incident the first day where I put in a DVD and it didn't seem to want to load, but after opening and closing the cover and it came right up. It has not happened since and I'm using it daily.I popped in a CD my sister had made containing a bunch of short movies off the internet and the ones correctly formatted in a way the player could read played just fine.It gets a 4.5 stars."
5,Very Good Sturdy Player w/EVERYTHING in Box,"Very good DVD player. We couldn't go anywhere with our 2 kids without it. We did have 2 7-inch (PET724) models crap out eventually over probably 1.5-2 years time, but the kids are rough on them and accidents happen. These are very sturdy, and ours would even get splashed with water from time to time. We upgraded to the 8.5-inch (PET824) this time and it has held up the best so far. The box included EVERYTHING that you would ever need and then some. Everyone who sees our player(s) comment on the high quality construction and the shiny ivory-like exterior surface."
3,VERY NOISY FOR THE PRICE I PAID...,"This DVD player was recommended to me by my IT person, so I bought it without reviewing the ""reviews"" on this product and I am sorry I did...even she has taken it off her ""recommend list"" I returned the item and got a replacement and it was the same. It is just so noisy especially when the DVD starts up and somewhat noisy when running. Also the volume doesn't' go very high. In the car it isn't loud enough unless the player is sitting on your lap... ON a good note the screen/image is beautiful."
5,AWESOME!! Player,"Got this for my wife and kid traveling outside the country and we liked watching the DVDs on this rather than our 27 inch tube tv. Colors are great, battery life is unbelievable. Short-listed Panasonic LS91, Sony FX8 and this and spent two days researching and decided on the Philips. GLAD I did that.Panasonic is great no question about that but is pricey. Sony display is not good enough. Philips surprised me...its like all those great Korean cars that are surprising everyone"
5,GREAT portable DVD player,"I travel every week and alot of times my flight will be over 4 hours. Most DVD players don't last that long and sometimes the plane doesn't have a power source, or it doesn't work so I'm dependent on the battery. This player hasn't stopped on me yet! Picture and sound are great. Excellent buy!"
