2,Great idea but not really reusable,"I bought the 10 pack, based on the reviews.It definitely worked great the first time I used one. It kept my head cool as I played tennis on a really hot day.But the problem is, It never completely dries. I washed it, and put it in dryer, it never completely dries. Once the stuff inside soaks water/sweat, you can never get rid of it, and soon enough it starts to stink.I had to painstakingly, slit a small hole in each of the 10, take out the chemical particles, and now I just use them as bandanas for sweat."
5,HeatMax EverCool Cooling Bandanas,I would recommend this product to others. My son works in a factory. It gets very hot. This product has helped him get through the heat.
3,"Cheap, disposable... so-so","Bought these for summer trip to Disney with the kids as an extra way of staying cool. They were moderatley effective initially, absorbing water and stayed moist and cool reaosnably well for a few hours in the hot Florida sun. But they lost the cooling sensation if not the ""wetness"" factor. Resoaking them at the parks helped. After a couple of days though, they absorb a significant odor from body perspiration and such. I threw them out in the hotel at the end of the 6-day vacation. Not worth saving."
2,not quite worth it.,"They do swell up in cold water, but you definitely have to do it for at least an hour and it helps to keep them in the refrigerator during that time. You also have to keep turning it to get the cool effect. I will use it when gardening because it's a little messy for good clothes."
5,Cool!,This is a great product! Used it when very hot golfing...did not last for 4 1/2 hr round...but helped!
1,Not very long lasting...,I got these for my family members who work in a hot warehouse all day. They work great at first but then after a couple of uses they dont really work well. I think they could be good for light use but not everyday use.
3,Bleeding bandanas,"I purchased these to take with me on vacation. The weather had been very warm and we were vacationing at the beach. I followed the directions on the package and was pleased with the way the product was working...until I looked in the mirror in the restaurant restroom! My whole neck had turned blue! I had tried the bandanas out before going on vacation (to avoid such an issue) and had no problems...my only guess is if you're wearing sunscreen, the color bleeds!"
4,A Nifty Way To Help Stay Cool,These bandanas have been a huge help getting me through the record heat we have had in the midwest this summer. Simple to activate and long lasting cool! They really do what they say they will. My only suggestion is to activate them and let them hang dry at least once before using since they do fade a little. Neat product and awesome service. I am a happy camper!
1,Ineffective,"No more effective, but 8 bucks more expensive than a wet rag. Oh well, it's just the 874th scam-that-sounded-like-a-good-idea that I've fallen for."
2,outdoor girl,"Product is cheap. One of the 4 coolers did not have enough crystals to inflate.Neckcooler material bleeds all over your clothing. Does not stay cool after about 45 minutes. Design is bad, when inflated, cooler does not want to bend easily around your neck. Feels like you are wearing a tire. Don't waste your money. I have purchased other neck coolers far superior to these that actually are comfortable and work well."
1,not worth the money,"I was so excited to get these, but how disappointing! The cold did not last long and they are just useless."
4,CLC nailbags,"These are pretty high quality bags. There are 2 things I don't like about them though. The small upper pocket on the left severely hinders access to the large pocket below, especially combined with the way the speed square flattens out the larger pocket. My other complaint is that none of the small tool pockets are big enough for a carpenters knife. The only knife that will fit is a supper cheapo job, but I use ones with quick change features."
1,Don't buy more than one,"Thought I would stock up on these and order 4 at a time. I got 4 each shipped and billed individually, Each box could have held 50 blades.I paid over $15 each once everything was said an done. Not a good deal."
4,"Adorable Moose, perfect Christmas stocking stuffer","Believe it or not, my six year old specifically requested a blue moose for Christmas and I was happy to find this little guy at Amazon. perfect size not too big, not too small - super cute hanging out of the top of her stocking Christmas morning. Overall, she really likes him."
1,This ain't Jah-pan Rasta.,"After so much bad press on these questionable & poor sounding recordings, the Japanese Music Labels are now marketing the albums as ""licensed directly from the Marley Estate"". The Japanese music mafia don't know to understand patois and the Marley's sure don't know how to speak Japanese. ...basically, no law suits have been filed....that is the license agreement you can get when no one wants to come to your country to live so they can sue you. Rasta not gonna do dat and dem know it. Save your money for your family, not theirs Ras. When the Marley family find the remaining gems that are worthy to be released in Our Father's name.... you can be sure they will do just that. Respect to the Most High Almighty Jah-"
1,the worst one?,"the sound is just terrible. if you want a good bob marley concert, get the japan one."
1,Very poor sound quality,"As per usual, the ""Japanese re-issue of the popular live series,"" is always hit or miss. Though Bob is Bob, and we all love the lyrics and music, this one is a miss."
4,Gilmour hedge shears,"The gilmour hedge shears are comfortable to use due to the nonslip handles, bumpers and the sharpness of the blades. The blades are large and for adult use only. The quality of the products should last for many seasons of use. One thing missing is a branch notch (used to cut hold)on the blade this would make the product complete. Overall I do recommend this shear to others to buy. Have fun cutting."
1,Not a USA Product,"This item can be labled as deceptive advertisement, as I view it. The product description on Amazon states that Gilmour has ""American made lawn and garden products"". I was searching for a hedge trimmer that was manufactured in the USA and was lead to believe that this product, made by Gilmour was manufactured in the US as well. Got the package, opened it up and stamped right on the blade, CHINA!!! Amazon needs to correct this product description, so that it doe's not imply that this product is made in the USA!! Gave a call to Gilmour and their rep. said that some of their products are made in the US and some in China. Then, they should not describe themselves as a US manufacture of lawn and garden products! Deceptive advertising as well, IMHO."
4,Conflict of Women,"Dr. Kovic and Dr. Eber have spent time making sure that this book brings a real world telling of the conditions women face in Chiapas. Southern Mexico has some skeletons in it's closet, and the study of the situation from a feminine perspective brings to Earth a more personal portrayal."
5,Patty my dear you done great,"I love this CD to death, it's true country and not this pop they play all the time on radio. if you liked the Oh brother soundtrack you will love this since it's the same down home country true fans love, and her voice is angelic and perfect for this type of songs. also Soul of constant sorrow is a different version of man of constant sorrow from oh brother. the people backing her up are outstanding, i could listen to it for hours with that banjo .....great stuff. buy this if you love country music not pop country too many sing."
5,Honestly Perfect.,"I purchased this album for my Mom a while ago because I was getting tired of hearing her play O Brother day in and day out, no offense to O Brother fans, it's a great album I just thought she could use some variety. Well she ended doing the same with this album and everytime I heard it one song always stuck out ""You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive"", it blew me away. It was so visual in my mind and mood placing. I really felt it gave you something to grasp onto. It was amazing and I looked forward to it everytime she had it on. And now I'm at a point where I'm looking forward to every song. It's such an amazing album, but I will admit that I still stop whatever I'm doing when ""You'll Never..."" comes on. It really draws me in. I will be purchasing this album soon and placing it in the section with my best."
4,mountian soul,"a very very good production of patti s music,it does have soul in her voice,If any negative about the cd would be the music should be more pronunced,this cd was worth the money and i glad she did this type of music,she can sing anything,,,"
5,Staggering,"I realize that there is a contingent of the bluegrass elite -- ""purists"" -- that will complain about lack of instrumental breaks and the like (no matter what folks claim, after awhile, banjo solos all start to sound alike, with the exception of Bela Fleck, and that's just maybe). But, face it, boys and girls, this is a wonderful CD and has already made it to my small stash of constant rotation items.Reasons: A wonderful selection of music; that striking, honest voice; and unbeatable musical instincts which inform and drive every song.All wrapped in a wonderfully authentic package.Hot CD, hot singer, hot production and guest appearances -- oh, just buy several and give them to your friends. You won't regret it."
4,Best In Years,"First I must say I am not a fan of bluegrass but of Patty Loveless. However, I did not buy her last two discs. I love her ballads mostly. This disc is one of her best in years. Although I am not a fan of gospel on country discs she does them justice. Her cuts with Travis Tritt and Jon Randall are excellent. There really isnt a bad cut here. If you are not a fan of hard core country you will not like this. Although I read on her website before this release that this cd was not a bluegrass album it does resemble bluegrass with the instrumentation and style of songs. To sum it up this collection is far better than most country cd's coming out now. It will get a nomination for either country or bluegrass cd of the year comparable to the recent dolly cd Little Sparrow. You wont be disappointed with this one."
5,The Album She Was Born To Make,"You want music so good it makes your gut hurt? Tired of the POPularized pablum that is called country music these days? In ""Mountain Soul"" Patty Loveless has reached into her roots and given us a 14 cut album of Bluegrass, Gospel, stone country and all soul! Patty's vocals are nothing short of phenominal, the vocal harmonies by Carmella Ramsey and Tim Hensley are crisp and clean, and add in Ricky Skaggs, Travis Tritt (yes I said Travis Tritt) and Rebecca Lynn Howard, it just doesn't get any better. The musicians: How about Earl Scruggs on Banjo, Tater Tate on bass and and bass vocals. Deanie Richardson just crushes the fiddle breaks and the twin fiddle by Deanie and Stuart Duncan are to die for. You are gonna grin, clog a little and cry a lot. Pay attention, Nashville, if it don't sound like this, it ain't country, Bluegrass or Gospel. This album is the Benchmark that country music will be compared to. And I guarantee, it will fall short of this masterpiece."
2,No demonstrated modifications and Injury limitations,"I liked this DVD. There are Pros to it, however there are also a few things that detract. The pros: the instructor is pleasant and the exercises are basic, but thorough. The cons: this workout is not suitable for anyone with a wrist injury or weakness. Only one of the stretches (the thigh stretch) can be easily modified and the instructor actually doesn't demonstrate any modifications. If you have arthritis, tendinitis or really any wrist or shoulder issues be aware that this is likely not the workout for you. You will need to be able to bear roughly half of your body weight on your wrists/shoulders for about 2/3rds of this workout.Again, if you have no injury concerns, it is a pleasant, basic and relaxing workout. It really is designed for people who are already in shape, have some familiarity with Pilates and have no permanent or recurrent shoulder or wrist injuries."
5,"Wow, I feel better","Simple instructions & a great way to release chronic muscle tension and pain. If you have tight hips, shoulders, back or thigh muscles, you might really get relief from this."
3,Not what I expected.,"I previously worked with a personal trainer who used upper-body foam rollers exercises in our workout, and I expected similar types that were not included in this DVD."
1,Foam Roller DVD Review,"I'm really disappointed with this DVD. 1) It doesn't play on the DVD player in my workout area. My other DVD's all work here, but not this one. I do have a DVD in my living room and it does work there so I can't return this. But, that player is about the same age so I'm not sure why it works on one and not the other. I have no room to workout in my living room - so it's of no use to me. 2) I wish I had known ahead of time that the instructor has a pretty strong accent. 3) It's way too much talking and not enough workout. I would not recommend this product.The Foam Roller, Workout & Massage"
2,Very miss leading,With this I only got the DVD. It looks like you get the foam roller also. I am very disappointed my whole reason for ordering this was for the foam roller. I am sure the DVD would be great if I had the foam roller to use with it.Maybe you should remove the comma after foam roller. You even talk about the foam roller in your description of the product.
2,Agree with S.A. Robbins,"I bought one of these hoses at a local walmart.Brought it home, hooked it up and the crimped end thatattaches to whatever spraying device you use, leakand sprayed water all over ..Applied teflon tape to the threads. Tried againand you could see water spraying out of the top of the crimped area.Returned it back to walmart and was going to just get anotherone in hopes that it was just that one hose. What do you know..there was ANOTHER returned one on the shelf AND I looked at the other sizesavailable, and one of those was a return as well ..Not a product that I would recommend ...Sad too because otherwise I like the sturdiness of the hose itselfand the faucet end connector worked flawlessly."
1,You get what you pay for.,This bargain hose is no bargain...it split within a few weeks of purchase...unruly to control. Don't bother...some things you just shouldnt purchase online!
1,complete lack of quality control,"Very disappointing experience with a poor quality product. I was sold on the life-time warranty-after all, if a company is willing to replace a hose years after purchase it's got to be good, right? Wrong. The moment i connected the hose and turned the water on i got sprayed from head to toe with a rather strong stream of water coming from a sizable hole in the welded (or shall i say unwelded?) part of the connector. After i mopped myself up i examined the hose and found that the connector had 4 small pinholes along the seam.After having to empty a 100-ft hose, roll it up and ship it back to Amazon i e-mailed Gilmour to express my disappointment. Not surprisingly my e-mail was completely ignored. I have a 7-dollar hose bought on clearance at Rite Aid that's held up great for the last 6 years withou the need for life-time warranty."
1,Bloated after first use,"I bought this hose based on stellar reviews. Used the hose for about 30 minutes yesterday and this afternoon found the hose bloated and swelled in four places. It is about to burst. I have no idea how this happened, or how it could have occurred given its limited use yesterday. It was stored properly in a hose reel. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to return it. Disappointing."
2,Gillmore 100' Hose,"I bought two of these and they are perfect. If they ever fail, the company will make it right. So what can you lose.Made very well. Shipped on time, packed right. I thought the price was reasonable for what you receive.Update: I guess I may have spoken a little to soon. I left the hose unrolled on the lawn today in the sun,,, went back to itlater and it has a bunch of ballon like structures. The back of the package says 'Not For Use With Hot Water' So you need toturn off the water and keep it in the shade when not in use. I'm thinking about returning this one, but it's a lot of hassel to shipit back, so I probably won't."
2,Hose Blisters,"I purchased this hose last spring. About a month after I got in, the hose developed ""blisters"" where the water leaked into the outer layers of the hose jacket. I called the mfg and asked about a replacement. They said to cut off both ends of the hose, mail them in, and they would sent a free replacement. I didn't want to buy another hose, while I waited for the free one, so I waited until fall to send the hose ends. The ""blistered"" hose lasted until fall with no leaks, but it looked like it could go at any minute. I have my free replacement, and will start using it in a few months. Hopefully, it will last. UPDATE: The replacement hose is fine. No problems."
2,Gilmore 8ply flexogen hose -- 5/8 inch -- 50 ft length,"I am only giving this hose two stars because it is HEAVY and simply not easy to use. Not only that but getting it stretched out to its full length is difficult due to its weight and the tightness of the coil that it was in in its packaging. I do believe that the hose will last me a long time and maybe the fact that it is so heavy proves it is well-made, but, if you are a woman without much upperbody strength and you do not want to struggle to move a hose from place to place in your lawn or garden, then, this is not the hose for you."
2,Don't go for cheap,"I went for this because of price. My mistake, it kinks and the kinks turn into squeezed shut areas that have to be worked back to open flo. Never will buy again."
5,Love this hose,We love this hose. It was what we expected it to be. I would recommend this hose to others and the price was good.
2,Not good in cold weather,"The hose is good when using in warm weather. However, when outside temperature drops to the low 50s and below, the hose is very stiff and hard to roll up or untangle. That's the only gripe I have."
1,Anaconda,"I've been using this hose for about a month now. It is lightweight and it resists kinking. However, it has a strange problem. The hose developed multiple bulges in different places. They haven't leaked yet, but I'm sure it's just a matter of time. I'm going to contact the manufacturer to see if it is aware of this issue.Update: I purchased this hose 6 months ago. The manufacturer never responded to my request (through its website) for information regarding the bulging problem this hose had. Interestingly, the bulges disappeared as the summer got hotter. But, the hose has developed a leak at the site of one of the former bulges. I would not purchase this hose again."
5,No Kinks! Yeah!,"I like this hose because it doesn't kink. Hey, a hose is a hose. It delivers water, except when it kinks. Cheapest 100 ft. non-kink hose I could find. Smaller diameter than I am used too, but I have low water pressure so it doesn't matter. Fits in the hose reel much better than the 3/4"" hose."
4,Lived up to hype,"I am so happy I bought this hose. Every one I have purchased prior to this has burst in a short period of time. So far I have had no problems at all with this one. I only wish I had bought the longer one, but didn't want to spend the extra money in case this one would fail also."
2,Defective Lining,"I bought the hose in July. It is lightweight and I was happy with it.But, by the following May, it had developed distortions that made the hose swell and threaten to burst over a span of about 10 feet about 20 feet from where the hose attaches to spigot. This also caused the hose to make funny sounds (the water was filtering in and out of the internal lining)and it affected the steadiness with which water came out at the end of the hose. In the end, I have had to retire the hose -- it didn't seem worth cutting out a 10 foot section to try to repair the hose when it is likely that the same problem will occur elsewhere. I notice that others have had this same problem. I've never seen it happen to a hose before -- after 25+ years of home ownership. Either I've been lucky in the past, or this hose had a defective lining that definitely prevents it from being ""the last hose I'll ever need"" as the manufacturer promised."
5,Perfect,I have already used this hose and I have to say I love the color and the durablity!!!! Doesn't leak at all like the cheap one I bought and took back to Wally World!
5,Nice hose,"Got the 100ft 1/2 inch for the front yard. My wife agrees it is so much easier to pull around the yard to water our plants as it is so much lighter than the thicker hoses. It does kink a little bit, but nearly as much as every hose I've ever used."
4,Great Hoses,"Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach."
5,"A good hose, not amazing","This is a decent hose and certainly isn't ""kink-free"" but then again, what hose is? It's 100 feet so you have to deal with a little kinking. If you're going to buy this and use is regularly, I'd strongly suggest getting something to wrap the hose around as it's not entirely manageable to wrap it around your elbow/hand. The connection seems really strong and it works as well as expected."
1,Lost in a Lost World,"This album is useless.Come on guys, just do one more concept album with Mike before we all remain lost forever. Please have that famous sentence on the album cover, i.e. ""All Instruments played by the Moody Blues."" Please, just one more time...You were a group, not back-up musicans for Justin (no offense Justin)..."
4,Good Collection,"A good collection of the Moody Blues' love songs and ballads. The music kind of spans their career with Night's in White Satin being the earliest piece of the group (and, almost a standard on any MB collection). The paired set of I Know You're Out There Somewhere and Wildest Dreams is here. Want To Be With You is a thoughtful piece and, to my mind, is kind of the MB take on what Pink Floyd talks about in One Slip. The set of New Horizons, For My Lady, and Nervous forms a moody group that I find to be more intimate. In My World is a sweet ballad. I find the title song, Say It With Love, to be too ""disco-y"". And, I think Haunted to be a bit light in quality. There's nothing really too heavy in the collection of 16 songs but the music is quite enjoyable. I wish they had included Forever Autumn (although not MB, it has been included in other MB collections)."
3,3.5 Stars,"I like this cd especially the Premo produced tracks, ok for just something to listen to but thats it not especially the head banger all the way through but a solid effort by Royce Da 5'9"
4,classic? anticipated? best? NO,Some ok beats mixed with SOME tight lyrics but with a mainstream flavor about it. Not exactly what i expected after the song i heard on the essential hip hop cd. i was hoping for a more underground feel but over all i would have to give it a 7.5/10 .
5,One Of The Best.....,"This Album should be considered a modern day classic. As a matter of fact it's the only c.d. that I've purchased in the last 5 years.This has everything from underground(Boom) to commercial appeal(U Can't Touch Me) to just plain raw(Soldiers Story, Who Am I, Off Parole). I'm also lookin forward to his 2nd album Death is Certain even if I have to wait another year before its release. So if you dont have this c.d. what are you waitin for???"
3,Gets the job done but it's a plastic piece of crap,This square may be good for home projects but isn't good for construction you could get a metal square for the same price
2,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As much as I might like to say that this is the worst NIN album, I won't, because it will cloud the fact that based on it's own merits this album is weak, and weak is not a word I thought would ever describe a NIN album, but it is......weak! Really, a step backwards in many ways. The arrangements, the melodies, the vocals, the lyrics, etc. are not exciting, because they're not inspired and it is OBVIOUS. I knew Trent was desperate the minute he had to attach Dave Grohl's name to the project, because it meant he needed help producing the album and selling the album. Grohl's drums are at best adequate and at worst annoying and boring (songs for the deaf was amazing, and I'm sure Trent was hoping for that spark!). Sorry! Trent played it way to safe! Low risk, low reward...period!"
5,High Quality Cable,Very well made cable. The components used are good quality and the price is outstanding. I purchased five so I can do my entire surround system. The results are great. Never thought I could do it for $29/each.
2,"Ok, but not great","The gauge is great, however I was dissapointed about the banana plugs. Most bananas fit tightly into the reciever/speakers, these do not! They metal is just a straight plug nothing really to keep them from falling out."
2,"Decent cable, but fake banana plugs","The connectors will easily slide out of equipment if jostled, and one of them comes out a little bit even when left alone, although doesn't seem to affect sound quality. Problem is these are not true banana plugs that bulge in the middle, as can be seen in the pic. Instead it consists of four separate pieces that spread out to get wider toward the tip. I tried spreading apart a little more hoping for tighter fit, and while it seemed to help at first it didn't last for long. Is alright for a budget but look elsewhere if value peace of mind."
5,Very Good Quality-Better Value,"These are well made and good sounding speaker cables. Immediately, my Martin Logan EM ESL's sounded ""more full"" than when connected with another major manufacturer's 99.9999% OFC ""audiophile grade"" 14 AWG wire. Two 10 foot runs shouldn't be that audibly different. No issues with the banana plugs on either the power output or speaker input side of the connection. Top shelf value."
5,"Well Terminated look good and thick, yet to be heard","Just following up on what others have posted about the banana plus becoming loose. Easy enough to stick a pocket knife in the gap between the plug ends and widen them out again. Not exactly rocket science guys!Speaker cables look and feel good and heavy and 12 AWG should provide more than enough current capacity for most home users. Tidily finished ends make the whole cable look very well built. Proof, however, will be in the listening, and I'm eager to see how they stack up against my Chord Odyssey 4 speaker cables (the same price unfinished PER FOOT as these are per TEN FOOT PAIR) audio-wise.Two more things - price is PER CABLE not per pair and the end shrinkwrap isn't that well, erm, shrink wrapped - I used a bit of blackelectrical tape to secure each shrink wrap."
2,Not Smith Victor,"These are not Smith Victor 14"" lights. These are Photogenic lights. Cheap product. Not worth the $$. Very disappointed. At How about being honest, change the current SV picture. Clearly feels like a bait and switch."
5,Excellent book,I loved it is a book full of adventure and action. I can't stop reading until I finished. The author is excellent.
5,David Humes knows his stuff,"I had the opportunity to attend a training class with David and wow! He not only knows Photoshop, he is a great speaker. He wrote this book for beginners like me as well as people who wanted to really understand how layers work and it is great. This is a great resource, I hope you find his book as helpful as I have.Tom Carpenter, Author - Wireless# Certification Official Study Guide, McGraw-Hill"
2,Not the same,"I recently was on a cruise ship where they used this product on me. The product they used was in a tube and seemed to work immediately!! When I tried to purchase on the ship, they were out, but gave me all the information I would need to find it online and purchase it. From what I can tell the ship must have a stronger product that actually works! This is very watery and DOES NOT give the same results as the trial on ship. I used the one on the ship 3 times and all results were the same. I have used the one I have for 2 weeks and NOTHING about it is close to being the same."
5,Best little Eye Gel,I was introduced to this product on a cruise and loved the difference it made to the puffiness under my eyes; great to use when I've had too little sleep or my allergies are causing increased puffiness; my tip is to let the product COMPLETELY dry before layering coverup or makeup products.
4,nice enough...nothing spectacular for the price,seems like a nice product. No miracles. I cannot say I will buy again. Expensive and I think there are other products as good for much less
4,Hyptonic,"Well I just received my Hyptonic CD in the mail today. The group has talent I will say. The only thing that keeps them from getting five stars and I hope they listen to this is the couple of songs that they have someone rapping on them. The lyrics and beat to those songs don't do this album justice. Those songs just don't measure up. Just stick to Lydia's voice. She carries this album along with the fact that she is given some infectious jazzy numbers. Stand outs on this album are track 3, When it rains, 5 Wastin my time, 6 Down, 8 Do you Dream. These songs are outstanding enough to make it not a waste of my time. It's unfortunate that 4. Moon& Stars, 7. Chill and 10. What strangeness(which would have really sucked if Lydia didn't sing toward the end) really bomb but they are lucky the rest of the album keeps them afloat."
1,Bad Book---Bad Girls,This is a BAD BAD book. Dont you dare be stupid and buy it like it did! I really didnt get it. I think Cynthia Voigt couldve done better than that.
5,Major Good Book!,"This book is about two girls who are, basically, bad. But in two different ways. Margalo is bad for mischief. She loves to play tricks and start rumors, and this eventually comes down on her. And Mikey is bad for anger. She is a good soccer player and plays on the team, but stupid Louis Caselli (who is also on the team and in her class) is always getting on her case, teasing her and calling her names like Porky and Mee-Shell. It's kind of lengthy but worth the time. There's a sequel, but I can't seem to get my hands on it....."
3,"Not Bad, But Not the Greatest",Bad Girls by Cythia Voight was a pretty good book. It was kind of slow at the start but got pretty good. Another thing I didn't really like that the book went on and on for somethings. The book was about two girls who were really tough and made trouble. It was quite funny at points.
3,Not so Bad *EASY A IN SCHOOL*,"Ok guys SLOW down. This is a book about two oppostie girls (prep and a rebel) being friends and surviving a strit fifth grade teacher. The book isn't as bad as others but it isn't 5 stars. Bad Girls is a nice easy read that you can read for school(like me) and get an easy ""A"". I don't find anything wrong with that!!~~~~LJ~~~~"
3,Bad Book about Stupid Girls,"OK, i managed to finish the book. my friend reccomended it. unless you are enthusiastic about reading about stupid girls punching people in the nose and wrong boys like that other person said, dont read it."
5,Works well,"I bought a pair to connect my Panasonic IP Network camera to my router and to the Internet. They have been working very well and are problem-free for the past 6 months. It will even work with my older Linksys 14Mbps Powerline adapter. This adapter is also slimmer and smaller than the Netgear 85Mbps model, which means it won't block the other power plug, unlike the Netgear. It is also less expensive."
5,It Works as Advertised,Had a homeplug compatible device (Dish Network HD Receiver/DVR) that I needed to connect to my router in another room. No easy way to run a cable. Bought the Actiontec adapter because of the price. Plugged it in and the Receiver/DVR came right up on the network. Appears to be a stable connection.
5,Great Product,This is a great product for some one that has a lot of things to hook up to the internet. I have my main wireless and hard wired router in the living room. I have one of the hard lines going to this and comeing out in the back room to my master computer. It is super fast and I have never had any problems. It is faster the the wireless N card I have.
4,Some people don't know what they're reviewing,"I was confused by other people's reviews on this book and I'm sure other people have been as well. This is NOT John Milton's epic, but actually a collection of historical criticisms on this work. I ordered this book by accident, basing my decision on other people's comments, but luckily I was glad about what I found. So if you want a perspective of famous views on Paradise Lost, buy this book. But if you want to buy John Milton's classic (which I would recommend as well), buy another book."
5,Outstanding Service,We ordered a softbound copy. They found that the copy listed did not meet their standards so they sent a hardbound copy at no extra charge. Great customer service.
1,Not really working,"I bought the charger with two batteries. I tried to use them on my Canon EOS 620, A2e and Elan IIe. I noticed on the first day that once I used the internal flash, the battery would die immediately. At the beginning, the rechargeable battery can turn on my A2e. However it got discharged after few days even without any camera usage. After charging the battery three or four times, now it won't work at all on my A2e even right after it is fully charged."
5,Best fondue plates,"I own white set of Roshco fondue plates and love them. This is a quality product, perfect size and what makes them so good for oil based fondue, they have a fork rest that allows oil to drip while you wait for the food to cool down. This plates are 9 1/2"" in diameter and have a good weight and feel very solid and substantial. Just perfect."
3,One great song..the rest..eh..,"I bought this soundtrack because I took a major liking to the Bootylicious Rockwilder remix..the song rocks!!!! But besides that, I don't care for any of the other songs except for the Survivor remix, but then again, that sounds almost like the original one. Not saying this is a bad album, but it's not one of the best either..that's why I don't understand why I see so many 5 star ratings, but to each his own, I guess."
5,Very good hip-hop soundtrack to an entertaining movie.,"This is the soundtrack to last month's MTV movie Carmen. If you liked the movie, you'll love this soundtrack. On this CD, all of the songs are included, plus a Rockwilder remix of Destiny's Child's ""Bootylicious."""
5,The Greatest Soundtrack,i think this is the greatest soundtrack i have ever heard and the movie is just great! you have to buy this soundtrack cause it is so great and you have to watch the movie cause Beyouse Knowles is so looks great!
2,"Good movie, bad soundtrack CD","Despite the mostly negative reviews I liked this movie. This CD, on the other hand, is another story. First of all it is a full-price CD at 35 minutes. Second there are actually songs from the movie that are not on this CD, which baffles me.Basically, if you can get it on the cheap and liked the movie, go for it. $15? No."
4,Not Bypass,"The description claims ""bypass anvil pruner."" It is an anvil pruner, not a bypass.The 18T is my favorite pruner. It aims easily so you can cut in areas where you can't see well, as in thick brush, grapevines, or spring perennial cleanup. It's handier than the bigger 19T, and has better leverage because your are closer to your work.Unfortunately, it's not the quality of the old 18T by SnapCut, before Gilmour bought it. But still hard to beat."
1,pruner breaks on first try!,"I was so proud to have ordered this as one of my husband's birthday gifts....we're big on landscaping our 5 acre yard, and are always fighting over tools, so i thought to get an extra...poor joe, as soon as he started using it, the spring flew off and it's useless....$12 something wasted...and of course, it's 'used', so it's not returnable....didn't realize that...I'd really thought your return policy was better than that....it was from amazon itself....joined the free shipping for a year, and so I will have to keep with that, but I'll certainly be more careful in purchasing other items...."
1,Chinese rip off,I was sent the 1/4 chinese model and promptly returned it. If there was something less than one star that would have been my choice for rating this item. Another American company bites the dust!
5,awesome!!!some of twiztid's best work,"whut up juggalosi just wanted to say whoever says this isnt twiztids best work is a juggahoe,i mean seriously this collection has alot of twiztis house of krazees roots....HOUSE OF KRAZEES that alone says its good.and they also have dark lotus songs witch are kick ass,like drunken ninja master.that song shines on this album.i love it.juggalo part is also really fresh as fxck,and the we dont die rock mix is awesome...i like them both but it depends on you mood which one to listen to.murder,murder,murder-what can i say,one of the freshest songs on this muthafako!!!well i would love to go on but i think i have said enough.BUY THIS ALBUM!!SOME OF TWIZTIDS BEST WORK!!!im outMCL"
2,Ouch,"Wheel cover fits well and looks good, but the quality is poor. It's very thin, but, worse, both sides have seams on the inner plastic layer that are very rough on the hands. I've tried installing this with various positionings, but there's no way to avoid these seams. It's better in the desert heat than no wheel cover, but I plan to replace this as soon as I find a better one."
3,"Understanding the Bible: An Introduction for Skeptics, Seekers, and Religious Liberals","Found the book to be interesting in some it's commentary of some of the person's in the Bile as well as some of its writers. It takes a documentary hypothisus view of the writers. States that not all the Bible is God's Word but it was written by men unattended by the Holy Spirit.However, it can be used as a source of other positions on the various parts of the Bible.Received book in great condition and prompt."
3,It was okay...,"From the back:When sexy Molly Laraway shows up asking about her dead sister's murder investigation, hardened detective Alan Chevalie tells her to go home and let him do his job. But with the oh-so-gorgeous lady saying she won't leave his side until he solves the case, he decides she could be useful to him--on the beat during the day, and in bed at night.Molly's no fool. She knows the tough-as-nails New Orleans detective spells trouble. But he's the only one who can track down the ""Quarter Killer."" Besides, something about this darkly attractive man makes her want a taste of danger. And she has no doubt that taste will only whet her appetite...My thoughts:Compared to other Tori Carrington books I've read, this one wasn't quite cutting it for me. I wasn't too fond of the first person view for Alan, then switching over to the 3rd person for Molly. It got rather confusing to me. Overall, though the plot was fairly good!"
2,Noisy,"As with another smokeless ashtray I tried, this one too started making a lot of noise after a few days. It works fine if you can tolerate the loud buzzing."
4,A True Audio Journey Back,"I wasn't sure when I read Bob Dylan contributed a song...to this album...The movie was very emotional...the music""haunting""...You can envision the men of this period as you listen, especially Stonewall Jackson...At times, you can ""hear""the ""hope"" rising in the hearts of his men and countrymen...then hear the sadness at his loss...A good album for Civil Warhobbyists... Regina"
3,God's & generals sound track,The Mary Fahl and Bob Dylan songs make it worth the purchase. I was disappointed that Bonny Blue Flag did not make it on the sound track.
5,Stunning,"Ok, maybe the movie was not one of the best of 2003, but this soundtrack is certainly worthy of an Academy Award, especially the magnificent song by Mary Fahl. I can't stop playing it - her vocals take my breath away. I can only imagine what gems are on her new cd, The Other Side of Time. And don't miss the Dylan and Fahl videos - Mary is gorgeous!!! For soundtrack fans, this is an album you must add to your collection. Between the amazing violins and Mary voice, you will not be disappointed."
4,Poignant and haunting,"Doesn't matter if you ever see the movie, this soundtrack will grab you and hold on. It's emotional without ever being ""in your face,"" as some epic orchestrations have been. It haunts you.Much to my surprise, Bob Dylan's song is both fitting and well-done, and I was never a Dylan fan. The etherial quality of Mary Fahl's performance in ""Going Home"" simply has to be heard.The music videos are a wonderful bonus. Overall, though, the orchestral pieces portray the sadness of a nation tearing itself apart, and it's powerful in a way far exceeding the typical epic style music. Mark O'Conner is one of the best fiddle players in America; here, as in The Patriot, he is key to the music's overall beauty.This one's a keeper."
5,What a Beautiful soundtrack![.],"I absolutely love this soundtrack it has a very haunting sound to it that is perfect for a Civil War movie like Gods and Generals. I also like the two songs Bob Dylan's ""Cross the Green Mountain"" and Mary Fahl's ""Going Home"" they are just wounderful and fit right in with the rest of this music!! I would highly recommend this to all who love beatiful music and to those who like soundtracks to war epics![.] You will not be dissappointed with your buy![.]"
3,"Not as good as ""Gettysburg""","Having seen ""Gettysburg"" when it first came out I instantly fell in love with the soundtrack. It's moving, impationed, almost patriotic in its style and with a definite militant bent. I can listen to it for hours on end and never tire of this stiring soundtrack. ""Gods and Generals,"" on the other hand, pales by comparison. This is all the more surpising given the fact that the same man wrote the music for both movies. Mind you, it is moving and beautiful music, but it doesn't fit the bill. Most of the pieces are too lilting, too mellow for for the subject. They don't impart the image of battle or convey the pulse of the fighting man. I do like ""Going Home"" by Mary Fahl (an overwhelming feeling of sorrow is palpable in this song), though the inclusion of Bob Dylan is downright bizarre. All in all, the CD achieves a certain level of entertainment, but, like the book it's based on, it simply lacks the impact of its predecessor."
5,A different and succesfull approach,"The soundtrack of Gods and Generals is really different from Gettysburg. You won't find epic themes as much as in Gettysburg, but the emotionnal part is still there, and deeper than in Gettysburg. That's the style of John Frizzel, who composed the main part of the score.And what a score !Just listen to the track 2, the powerful chorus which remembers you the Saving Private Ryan soundtrack. You have to have this CD just for this theme !The others are very well done too, the Irish theme and the theme of the Virginia Military Institute. You will enjoy it !That's not as epic as in Gettysburg, but it give a different and I think a more ""mature"", serious, face to the movie than in Gettysburg.Confederate will appreciate some of the tracks which reminds the ""southern aristocraty"" Hoolywood love to bring to the screen. And the DVD gives splendid Bonus to this CD, the Mary Fahl's video (with great scenes from the movie) and Bob Dylan's.A must have for all music fans !"
3,Not as Good as Gettysburg,I looked forwarded to this soundtrack as I have played the Gettysburg soundtrack hundreds of times. This soundtrack is not up to the same quality and only a few tracks are done by Randy Edelman. I wish I could just rip the last track (the Dylan) song from the album as his voice is more shrill than ever and does not belong on this album and was a terrible choice.
3,Boring Movie; Decent Soundtrack,"By giving this soundtrack 3 stars I'm not saying it is horrible in the least. What I am saying is that it is no where near as good as the original Civil War movie ""Gettysburg's"" soundtrack. Personally, they should have let Randy Edelman compose the whole soundtrack and it most likely would have been alot better! If you don't have the Gettysburg soundtrack - GET IT!"
1,A real ripoff---returned the set immediately.,"This was almost an empty box with some very simple experiments that can be done with household materials. There were some wire coils, foil, and not much else! There was no circuit board or any useful material. For a few dollars more and no shipping charge more we found a fine electrical set at Radio Shack."
5,Our family love this series. Fun and great kits,This kit is great. Three complete kits that are completely hands-on. The children create everything from scratch. They make there own light switch from simple materials and by doing so they really get a good understanding of the topics. Booklets are very well written and designed. My children are excited to do all the sets in this series.
4,Newton's Quest 5th grade,I am using this program and others to home school a nine year old. He thoroughly enjoys learning with this type of computer product.Thanks for the speedy shipping too.Shirley
3,Ken Ishii - Future In Light,"While I admire Ken Ishii and love his work, FUTURE IN LIGHT didn't quite do it for me. For one, the spirit of experimentalism isn't as evident as in some of his other work. Instead, there's plenty of sonically dense, glitteringly bright tech-house (""Awakening,"" ""Auburnia,"" or ""Fadeless"" are all good examples of this). A few tracks show more of Ishii's inventive spirit: ""Beep Twist"" is a packed full of complex and swirling sounds; ""Strobe Enhanced"" bleeps, bloops, and hits hard. But other tracks, such as ""Melting Point,"" sound as if they could have been made by anyone. Perhaps the US-only track, ""Creative State,"" best sums up the album as a whole: a very good techno album, but only an okay Ken Ishii album."
5,Seeking personal fredom? A must read,"Infinate Abilities is a powerful work that can change your life.If one is seeking to become free of the negative influences upon them whether self imposed or the result of external pressures from family or society, this is a must read. The story is compelling and the result was like being hit with an 8 lb. hammer at the hands of John Henry. It has changed my life forever. Thank You Ivy!"
1,Possibly the worst book of its type.,"To call this book garbage is an affront to garbage everywhere.This book is awful -- it trivializes important ideas and larger forces. I am willing to bet that Helstein is a hoax. There are no psychic forces at play here -- this is a load of hooey packaged to look like there is some substance. Even the reviews appear to be concocted among friends. Notice to would-be writers -- if you're not for real, get a job -- don't put junk like this on the market."
4,Give up the cheap garbage and buy a real hose.,"I'm a new home owner and I bought a cheap 50' hose to spray weed killer on the lawn. A hose is a hose, so why waste money? I learned quickly what misery a bad hose is. It was kinking in a dozen places before I even unwound it the first time. It was stiff, awkward, hard to move around, constantly kinking. I spent more time troubleshooting the line of hose than using it.I went online and bought aGilmour 10-58025 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-25-Foot, Greenand aGilmour 10-58100 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot, Greenthe very next day. These are so much nicer. They feel better in your hand. They move better. They kink less. And they have a ridiculously good warranty (just clip off the ends and mail them into the company for a replacement). You only need so many hoses around the house and you might as well make them good ones."
5,As advertised,I added an additional 25 foot section of the Flexogen hose to my existing 60 feet.Both are trouble free and operate as advertised. Connection is leak free as well. Great product.
5,"Quality, USA made","I bought this hose at a very low price (it has since doubled) for my patio. It is extremely high quality, and that's easy to see. Not heavy, but not light either given the heavy duty eight ply construction. Doesn't leak, kinking is nearly a non issue, and the couplings are machined and leak free. I realize this is just a garden hose, but it's a superb product. Best part is it is USA made, and apparently they don't mess around with their warranty. I will be purchasing the 50' 3/4"" hose for the lawn as well."
5,"Wonderful Quality, Spacious Bowl","I loved this bowl the first time I saw it being used at Starck Bar at LACMA. It reminded me of Pick-Up Stix. The product is beautifully made, inspiring to look at, and fits a great deal of fruit. It's a highlight of my kitchen, and I enjoy it every time I look at it."
3,Not as impressed as others,I was hope for something a bit larger (for the price) but as a small counter top piece its just ok. Design is great but size doesn't match the cost. Better to look on eBay for someone selling a used one.
5,review,"I am so glad to have discovered this band. I personally describe the music asindie rock and post-hardcore (let's say At the Drive in meets Rainer Maria).Music is great, a more than competant guitar player, and two vocalists."
5,Better than Land of the Loops,"The first time I saw Plan B was when he opened for a Modest Mouse show in Seattle. His album is amazing, I listened to it for two weeks straight when I first bought it. I am glad that Plan B is finally getting some exposure, as Like a Ship Sailing is an amazing album. Much better instrumental beats than Land of the Loops, with more jazz samples, and its not too mellow. If you get anything out of my review of Plan B, it is that the album rocks and everyone should have a copy most definitely. support the great Northwest bands and enjoy."
4,A must for any bike with aftermarket pipes,"I got this installed by the dealership for $128 and the bike runs better and has a good performance boost. A must have for any bike with aftermarket pipes. I was able to install the pipes myself, however, not these because the instructions were not specific to my bike and I didn't feel comfortable going at it myself on my new bike. Installed on a 2002 Yamaha Vstar 650 (used Vance & Hines Cruiser Exhaust). Great buy, 4 starts because of poor instructions. I couldn't find online how to install them on my specific bike either. Better instructions could have saved me some cash, but the dealership would still do better with the mixture adjustment and carb. sync anyway I'm sure."
3,Landscape Resource for South Florida and Related Climates,"Palm Beach Garden Club put out this book to give those who love gardening and creating a special tropical retreat in their own backyards. The photos are ok as it would be nicer if they showed the landscaping use of the plants in some photos instead of showing the plant so you see what it looks like. Excellent resource for those in South Florida. However, Tropical Gardens and Tropical Plants by William Warren are far better. Yet for the neophite this book isn't bad--I found it a useful reference as long as you don't take the advise from the orchid section"
2,Nothing..,"This cream was one of the highly recommended and most acceptable price value on amazon.com, but I did not find it affective at all. I followed the directions and all, but I guess some things are just too good to be true.."
1,Dagget & Ramsdell knee lightening cream,"Sorry, this product is totally a SCAM. its a SCAM, doesn't work and unfortunately people keep buying it because is comes up first when googling this type item. Please don NOT waste your money! I will be getting a refund."
3,HOT ON THE BOX,"Don't know what film the other guy was looking at, but this film Fighting Chance has all the hotties. The action is real good, but i think they for got to pull a few hits. I have seen it a few times and me and friends would like to me the girl on the cover. She's hot in the movie."
3,"An entertaining, often humorous movie!","Actually, this was a good film. Although there are a lot of new faces in the movie, it was clear that the central characters have a lot of experience in the martial arts. There were also many humourous scenes that added to the action-oriented entertainment. I'd like to see more from these guys!"
1,SAVE YOUR LOOT! DON'T BUY THIS ONE.,Where's the hot chick on the cover of the box? No where in this film. Buy this movie if you want to see martial arts performance at its worst. The moves are so fake. Me and my boys didn't even make it through the first 15 minutes. The Brady Bunch came on TV and we found it to have more action than this film. And where are the broads in this film!
4,Refreshing and much better than expected,"Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney make a wonderful couple on screen. Debra Messing especially grabbed attention with her freshness, beauty and liveliness. The dialogues were also well-written. The secret why her fiancee left her 2 years ago and the rivarly between the two half sisters were intriguing. Not to mention the beautiful English countryside and the beautiful bride, her sister.The only unconvincing detail - it is hard to believe Debra Messing in the first place could, or was willing to, pay $6000 for an escort, even if it was Dermot Mulroney. Yet it won't hurt the fairy tale a bit."
4,Cheesy chick flick,It's a cheesy chick flick with a somewhat twist on Pretty Woman. It's not the best movie in the world but still an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.
3,Cute. okay,"Sort of the poor man's My Best Friends Wedding. It is cute in spots , but terribly dry in others. Messing is not used to full advantage and really looks very slovenly throughout. Mulroney is cute, sweet and charming and comes off well. But the big laughs just aren't there. Holland Taylor gets the best lines and comes of best. Okay for a boring rainy night."
3,So So,"This is a so so movie. It has it's moments, but there aren't enough of them. Dermot Mulrooney is hot (as usual) as are some of the british male cast. He says & does the right things. As he is paid to do, being a hired man. However there is rarely any heat generated between him & Messing. I think I saw sparks between them in one scene & that's all. There's actually a scene with them in the bathroom where he's naked & she's not. I supposed they are supposed to be awkward or something, but it really falls flat. I liked the subplot concerning her little sister (who's the one getting married). Sometimes the movie is a little fun & kinda sweet. The british friend is very brash & althought sometimes funny she almost seems to belong in another movie. Maybe an R-rated one, as this is PG-13. It's okay, not great. A rental, not a purchase."
2,Dermot Mulroney tries hard to lift this,"I'm a big fan of Dermot Mulroney's work. He was underrated in ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" understated in ""About Schmidt"" (when he could have gone completely over the top), and under-appreciated in the cult gem ""Living in Oblivion."" He's (by far) the standout in this thin film (clocking in at about 1 hr 17 mins), which is a watered-down attempt at sort of a quasi-reverse ""Pretty Woman.""The movie is an adaptation of Elizabeth Young's novel ""Asking for Trouble."" The book seems to have its fans as good chick-lit: it has a 4.5 rating from 81 reviewers here on amazon. And, the film does have its moments. Still, there were stretches of 10 - 15 minutes of absolute silence from the audience. Never a good sign for something going for at least a few laughs. This is one of those films where everything good about it is packed into the trailer, leaving absolutely nothing to question (except the one little twist which provides a fairly good kick at the end)."
2,"Sad to say, it sucked...........................","I love Dermott and I love Ms Messing (we also call her Lucille Ball in this house), but this movie was so disappointing to me. I only get out for a very few films at the actual theatre and opt to instead wait for mostly everything on DVD. There are a few previews that make me run to the theatre and this was one of them. The preview did indeed, unfortunately, have all of the fun scenes in it and the rest of the movie was slow with bad timed or bad taste liners and a predictable plot which dragged. Predictable plot is fine if there is some chemistry between the two main characters to begin with . The movie left me wanting more of both main actors, but in a different movie with perhaps some interesting dialogue???? Wait for the DVD and rent it on Netflix on a very slow rainy afternoon and your disappointment will not be as great as mine."
3,Entertaining but fades in the stretch,"This film has a good beginning, and Messing's performance is very good throughout. The story premise is interesting, different, and the director almost gets you thinking it's believable rather than just romantic fluff. But Mulroney's performance is uneven. He gets off to a good start, but becomes unconvincing toward the end. Could be the directing, but the real problem seems to be the screeplay. Mulroney starts falling for her, but there is no basis written into the story to make it convincing. There are other believability issues toward the film's ending, but discussing them here would have a spoiler effect. I enjoyed this film for the most part, but found the last few scenes unconvincing and hard to make sense of."
5,AN Excellent Movie,"This movie was well written, with two very matched actors. It was funny yet told A very good finding love story. Would very much like to see A follow up film."
4,Great Product and Excellent Service,This product is wonderful. Always brightens my mood when I watch it. The customer service was also great! Received my order in good time and good condition.
4,Good movie,"Good, fun chick flick! You will hate a couple of the characters, and love a few of the others! Will watch again!"
4,Thw Wedding Date,Delivery was a little longer that I thought it should take but the product was still in plastic- great product.
2,The Wedding Date,"I expected this movie to be a funny romantic comedy, but it really wasn't. Debra Messing is the jilted lover, expected to put in an appearance at her sisters wedding. She wants to make her ex jealous, and show the rest of her family that she has moved on. An escort is hired to be her boyfriend because her family is hideous to her about how it should be you getting married. She ends up with the surprise of her life when she finds out her ex was involved with her sister at the same time. This is not one of my favorites. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney only give adequate performances."
2,romance?,"There was absolutly no on-screen chemistry between the two main charcters, The story line was cute and had such potential but in the end didn't get much into the ""main"" relationship, I serious let down"
3,"A very bad movie, but...","Although, this is a really bad movie I can't stop watching it. I watched it twice yesterday and plan on watching it again today. I love Debra Messing in Will & Grace, but in this she sucked. She cannot carry a sitcom by herself, so heaven knows why anyone thought she could carry a movie. Mulroney was great and he looks soooooooo good, he just needed someone like Julia Roberts or Jennifer Aniston to really bring this home. The story is choppy, and there was no chemistry between the two what-so-ever. Her hair is annoyingly bad almost throughout the whole movie. I mean the list of reasons why this movie is bad goes on and on, but I cannot stop watching it."
3,Could have been...,"This movie could have been a romantic comedy classic, along with predecessors Pretty Woman, My Best Friends Wedding, While You Were Sleeping, You've Got Mail... and the likes of them. But compared to all those classics, this one just really failed to build up the characters and to deliver the true essence of the story. The chemistry of the two leads was there but the movie wasn't able to explain what they liked about each other... what made them fall in love. You just seem to find out that suddenly, boom!, out of the blue, that they actually now love each other. I think if they added 30-40minutes more to this movie, it would have been a great one. It is not a bad watch actually, but lacking. What a waste!"
4,"Unrealistic, but captivating","The Wedding Date is a great movie for people who like happy endings, and love romantic comedies. The characters are three dimensional and have a personality and even though it's highly unlikely that a woman could fall in love with her male escort at her sister's wedding, the web the director weaves is sparkling in its own way."
2,"Not a romantic comedy, just a mildly friendly flop","Although it was cast as a Romantic Comdey, it was neither romantic nor funny. There was absolutely no character development!Dermot Mulroney is a horrendous actor, only proven by this monotone, emotionless straightfaced throughout the whole movie chop acting job. The dialogue was absurd as well. The storyline was incredibly choppy and the plot line was predictable and weak at best. The relationship between the main characters was the least built up. The supporting actors provided the best of the movie and the few decent scenes revolve around heartfelt one liners. It was NOT funny in the least! Overall barely 2 stars. A HUGE disapppointment!"
3,A Little Lark,"THE WEDDING DATE gives the viewer everything that could be expected from the title - vapid story, implausible situation, an array of clothes and pretty people, and a story that can be followed while reading the paper or browsing a magazine. But what makes this little film charming is the degree of commitment from such solid actors as Dermot Mulroney and even Debra Messing. They make the fluff fluffier and palatable and before you know it you're actually watching the final half of the movie!This is a 'no great shakes' movie, sort of an extended TV sitcom, but take it for what it is (why else would you have rented/bought it?) and it is a pleasant diversion. And they keep making these movies for a reason.... Grady Harp, August 05"
4,"Biased, but loved it","The truth is I'm biased because my man proposed after we watched this movie! Needless to say it's very hard to top that! But I think I can be objective in saying it was very entertaining, worth the price of the movie ticket, and worth also picking up on DVD when available. So my sentimental rating is ""5 stars"" and my objective rating is ""4 stars"". I am VERY hard to please when it comes to comedy - it's just not my genre and I don't laugh easily, but this movie did it. Debra was absolutely charming. I laughed a lot and never became bored. There were a couple of moments when I thought I might become bored, but the film always came back with something to re-inspire my attention, interest, and enjoyment just in time. Very good and definitely recommended, even if you're not big on the comedy genre."
2,Evil family dynamics at play,"Is it me, or am I the only one horrified at the lack of family loyalty and boundaries in this ""romantic"" comedy? Since when is sleeping with your sister's finance and breaking her heart in the process just a trivial issue to be dismissed? Debra Messing did a great job as the lovelorn woman. Can't say that about of the other characters. Her sister was a shallow twit that we are to believe that EVERYONE was in love with. Go figure. Happy ending? Our heroine ends up with the male hooker - What a catch - Am so happy for her!"
1,IT SUCKED!!!!,"Debra Messing plays a single woman who hires Dylan McDermott (or whatever his name is -- I get those guys mixed up) to escort her to her sister's wedding and then they fall in love. If you want to know why they fall in love perhaps there is another movie to watch, because it sure isn't explained in this one. The movie is one boring scene after another, with boring one dimensional characters. And what's the deal with Debra Messing? When she first came on the scene in those early Seinfeld episodes, she looked hot! She also looked good in Will & Grace. But she is downright unattractive in this movie. Maybe it's the lighting, maybe she's aged, but she looks terrible. That a smooth player like Dylan Walsh (or whatever his name is) would fall for her is laughable. Save your money and watch Pretty Woman for the 100th time if you want to see a good romantic comedy."
1,LONG. BORING. STUPID & S L O W :-(,"While this did have a few funny-ish moments, the majority of the movie was long, boring, stupid and slow. Not to mention the wasted talent of Debra Messing and Dermot. I don't think either are desparate for money, so why would they take on a role such as this. It was torturous to watch. I'm so glad I didn't see it at the theatre and pay more money than the dvd rental cost. I think I forgot to mention predictable too. You know what's comming. I should have trusted my instincts and stopped watching it earlier, but it was like those train wrecks you can't take your eyes off. Sorry if I've upset anyone, - I'm just being honest."
2,"It's ok, nothing special","Wedding Date is an ok movies. It' formulaic and nothing too special. In the end it's a cute little romantic movie, but there are better ones out there..Pretty Woman is one example."
3,ok,"The only reason i seen this movie was because two of my friends dragged me into the theater lol. I'm not the type of persons into chick flicks but this movie wasn't bad. The movie had some funny parts and some drama. I kind of knew how the movie was going to end but i didn't mind.The movie centers on a woman who buys a male escort to take her to her sisters wedding. She wants to use him to make her ex-fiancée jealous. Her and her escort starts to show feelings for one another. Well by the end of the movie, she finds something out that would make any woman pissed. I will not tell you the ending but i'm sure you have already figured it out for yourselves."
3,What's my MOTIVATION?,"I like Debra Messing and I like Dermot Mulroney, and they were both good in this movie. That said, though, the movie as a whole wasn't great. The acting was ok, the premise was cute, but the script needed some work and the love story was just bad. Where was the development? How were they suddenly in love? There was maybe ONE I'm-sort-of-maybe-falling-in-love-with-you scene and then they were making out. It made no sense. There was absolutely no motivation for the two main characters to act the way they did, and it's hard to forgive that, even in a movie."
2,This movie has it all,"If you are looking for a movie that features a sister sister relationship, a farce, an airplane AND a wedding... then this is your movie. The Wedding Date has it all! By far, the most entertaining part is when Debra Messing says, ""Yeah, I'm just fine. Nothing a bottle of Jack and a straight razor can't fix."" (to which she strains a forced smile) The plot is disjointed and the scenes leave too much to the mind and not enough right in front of you, so that you can't truly enjoy it for what it is... a mindless, cheesy, not quite Can't Buy Me Love, cliche, romantic comedy. With a few mind-altering subtances and a couple friends, you can easily sit through this movie and probably even laugh here and there. My friend D says that figuring out the plot was the only interesting thing about it... I say, the soundtrack and Debra Messing's eye make-up make it all worth while."
1,1 star for the wedding center pieces,"Stinko, Does Dermot have any facial expressions, I think he slept through this movie with his eyes open. Messing is such a one note actress she always plays the neurotic, unmarried, loser she must be related to someone high up on the food chain in Hollywood. Save your money."
2,"Pretty Wo ""MAN"" at My ""Best Friend's Wedding""","Romance isn't dead...it just costs $6,000. From the previews this movie resembled ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", but after viewing it I see large differences. Some of the scenery is much better and Julia Roberts is not in it. Plus, Julia's hooker role from ""Pretty Woman"" now goes to her ""Best Friend's"" co-star Mulroney. If you can stomach another 'for hire' love story and enjoyed ""Best Friend's Wedding"" you'll love this. Well, except for the corny quickly summarized ""6 months later"" endings a la' ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" which were actually cute and somewhat funny in their day. The gaping holes in the script are also a minus. Hummm, does the fact that he's an escort really never get realized (with the exception of a small remark by her step-father regarding a magazine article )? Good grief!"
3,It's okay,"This movie left a lot to be desired, it could've been better, I thought the acting was okay, it left you hanging in parts"
3,A Fairytale and Cute,"The movie itself is cute. I had seen the movie on TV and thought it was good to have when you need to vedge-out and not have to think too much. Definitely a girls' movie.But I was disappointed and need to return the DVD since it was defective and would not play, so I was unable to watch the entire DVD. I will return it for an exchange of the same movie."
2,No romance and no comedy,"The Bottom Line:The Wedding Date apparently decided to cut out all the parts that make a romantic film work (the scenes in which the main characters, you know, fall in love and stuff), maybe because it follows formula so rigidly that the audience already knows they'll end up together anyway; as it stands the movie checks in at about 78 minutes of embarrasingly bad, uninvolving filmmaking that will appeal to no one.2/4"
5,Enjoyable movie.,"All together is a good movie, the scenes in London make it much better, Mulroney looks real hot on his role of gigolo, Debra Messing,..well, let's say Grace without Will. Is a very good storie including betrayal, a wedding and lots of good looking people."
2,Not worth your time,"I love romantic comedies and both of these actors, but this movie was not good. I gave it two stars because it was below average. I watched the whole thing, hoping for it to get better, but it didn't. Then I tried to watch the commentary, thinking that at least hearing the making of the movie should be interesting. Wrong. I couldn't make myself watch more than 10-15 minutes of it. The only person on the commentary was Debra Messing--not even the director or the producer--and she had no idea about why things were the way they were. The only things she could comment on were scenes she was in and she didn't have a lot to say. There were several minutes of complete silence. I think it should have been called 'watch the movie with Debra Messing'. And, like I said, I like her, but this movie was pretty poor. She referred to the movie's low budget several times, saying they didn't have time to do any more than X takes of a scene, so maybe that explains it."
5,Romantic Comedy,"Among the best romantic comedies in the last 20 years this film has humor, excellent acting, and cast enthusiasm. I seldom buy DVDs but this was a must have film."
2,TV afternoon show for the cinema,Oh goodness... a TV style romantic comedy for the cinema. The plot is really far fetched. American airline employee employs a gigolo and flies half way round the world to attend her sister's wedding. It turns out she is a British American and she tries to make her British ex-boyfriend jealous. The flim makers can't make up their mind to make a British romantic comedy or an American one. 4 Weddings and A Funeral was set in the UK only so situations are really British. This one is like 4 Weddings and A Funeral mixed with Pretty Woman (only things this time its a he). The story could have turned out better if either it was set entirely in the UK or in the US. Gotta logoff... got to recover from the 90 min jaglag from this movie.
3,Cute ... But That's Just About It!,"This is a decent romantic comedy with so many holes in the plot and exaggerated performances. It's still very cute. The best thing about the film is the soundtrack, which features Maroon 5 and Michael Buble. It sure makes a nice DVD rental for a romantic evening, but to see it in the theatre ... uh, maybe not."
1,A perfect sleeping pill !!!!!,"This is probably the most boring movie that I saw last year. The stars are adorable, but had no chemistry whatsoever. After reading many of your reviews for this movie, most of which were positive, I have to question my own judgement, and wonder if I must have missed something ?"
1,Not Romantic; Not Funny,"I watched this movie while on an airplane. Even though I had to be strapped in my seat for 7 straight hours, I still thought after watching this, ""WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME!!!!"""
1,Anyone who rates this above 1 Star is CRAZY,"An hour and twenty minutes of pure torture. This movie seemed longer than the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Trilogy.Debra Messing should stick to sitcoms. And the guy (whatever his names is) should stick to staying away from movies.Bad Things About This Movie:1. Debra Messing2. The Hooker Guy3. Everyone Else4. Plot5. Hair and Make up (my wife's main gripe)6. ScriptThe Good Things About This Movie:1. One Hour Twenty Minute2. Back at netflixAddionally, what woman in her right mind is going to sleep the same room with someone she just met? Very dangerous and stupid, like this movie.STAY AWAY, FAR AWAY!!!!"
5,Love the movie!!!!!,I love this movie and wanted to have a copy for myself. It was in great condition when I got it. Thank you
1,so many gaps in the plot,"I think this could have been a fun and entertaining movie, but there were just some major holes that left the character motivations pretty weak. It made the whole thing seem pretty unrealistic, and I felt unattached to the characters."
2,Aimless,"This movie is aimless and the characters are completely unbelievable tropes. This is a poor rendition of ""pretty woman"" in reverse (the hooker is now a man). The tired meme of the crazy (but somehow very successful) family. Ugh. All that lame and no reason what-so-ever to care."
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!,I can't say enough about this movie. I absolutely LOVED it. Dermot Mulroney is SMOKIN' HOT in this one! The story is great and the chemistry is out of this world. A MUST SEE!!
4,At bit dissappointing to those of us who read the book,"I loved the book (Asking for Trouble by:Elizabeth Young) which this movie was based on. But while the movie was ok it was nothing compared to the movie. Don't me wrong it was fun but I highly recommend the book over the movie, as many changes were made.The Basic Plot:Kat's sister is getting married and she needs the perfect date to the wedding to show off to her family and ex-fiance (best man)... so she hires an escort... They fall in love, but it's not as simple as that.... also she finds out that her ex was cheating on her with... you'll have to see... quite shocking for those who haven't read the book...The movie is fun for girls... but there are many gaps confusing those who haven't read the book... because alot is left out... but for the genre it is a good film!"
1,CHEESY!,"Overly cheesy movie - and I love cheesy romantic films. How can they fall ""in love"" without having any real interactions? And the lines are horrible: ""I think I would miss you even if I never met you"" ""I would rather fight with you than make love to anyone else"" - since when is a gigalo's job ""making love?"" Stupid movie with choppy story-telling. The deleted scenes should have been left in to give the story more substance."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I really wanted to like this movie, but the writing & plot were pretty weak, the acting wooden & shallow, and there was very little chemistry between the leads. There are so many better romantic comedies out there...don't waste your money on this one."
2,'Pretty Woman' it ain't.,"The Amazon editorial review says it all really. This film begs comparison with 'Pretty Woman', but where Richard Gere is charming, Julia Roberts irrisistable and the pair together had real chemistry, Dermot Mulroney is the Robert Stack of the new millennium, as wooden as they come, and there is no chemistry whatsoever generated between him and Debra Messing. This makes it impossible to suspend disbelief that the plot is utterly ridiculous. If you need a movie to keep you out of the rain, this'll do it, but it won't generate the lasting affection of 'Pretty Woman.'"
3,The Wedding Date,"Kat (Messing) does not want to go alone to her sister's wedding. So, she hires an escort named Nick (Mulroney) for $6,000. Soon, they are off to England for the ceremony. She hasn't seen her family in a while, and only gets along with her stepfather (Egan). Oh yeah, and her ex-fiancee (Sheffield) is the best man. She wants to make him jealous, but soon sparks begin to fly between her and Nick.""The Wedding Date"" is a romantic comedy with no originality. One could argue that the genre itself has no originality, but this movie feels cobbled together from scenes from romantic comedies past. I hated ""Pretty Woman"", and there are enough similarities in ""The Wedding Date"" to make me cringe. The leads, Messing and Mulroney, do the best with what they have, and there are some laughs, but unless you really like romantic comedies, this movie is not for you."
5,THE BEST MOVIE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH!!! :),THE WEDDING DATE IS THE BEST MOVIE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. IF U HAVEN'T SEEN IT.. SEE IT! IF U HAVE.. SEE IT AGAIN!! :) IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE A ZILLION STARS. WOW. & THAT GUY IS SOOO GORGEOUS!!!!!!! :)
5,Chick Flick,I love this movie it's timeless. It's one of those movies that I could watch over and over. I was going to order the DVD version of this movie but Roku made it so much more convenient for me. Thanks amazon
3,"Annoying characters, but good plot","This movie is cute - up to a point. There are a few good laughs with the whole male escort plot. I gave it only three stars because, after a while, you just get sick of the characters. They're obviously made for a female audience. Debra Messing's character (Kat) is so needy and pathetic, while Dermot Mulroney (Nick) is portrayed as the perfect guy. Jeffery, the ex, is pure slime. Come on! Is this really how people behave? The movie even seems to allude to this, with one of the characters asking whether Nick has any flaws, and Kat saying none. Maybe if the characters had been a bit more interesting this movie would have gotten more stars."
1,Typical Christian misinformation,"Mr. Telchin's book is a sad read, as it promotes the standard supercessionist replacement theology that the Gentile church fathers began. Bottom line, if God abandoned His promises to Israel, in any way, Christians have no hope for God's faithfulness to them."
1,Just a pat on the back for Christian beliefs,"Fine if you are a non-jew. However, the Torah clearly defines the role of the Jewish people in this world as handed down by Hashem at mt sinai: Teshuva - To repair the world. To do mitvahs and be a light unto nations. Read a book or books from a real Jewish point of view, eg, The Committed Life by Rebetzin Esther Jungreis"
1,DO NOT BYE(WU-TANG FANS),"This is the not the group that you think thats from wu-tang clan Royal Fam-timbo king, dreddy, this is some grunnk music that just doesent make sence to me, and that took The original Royal Fam(wu-tang)'s Name.Be healthy"
5,Christianity is the only religion where the existence of God is shown ahead of time in prophecy,No book spoke about the coming of the Buddha. No book aluded to the divinity of any emperor. No book mentions a future prophet finding any golden tablets or lost writings about the divinity. Only the OT prophecies speak of the coming Messiah and Eusebius shows plainly that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of all the OT prophecies.
5,A highlight from my middle school years,"I loved to read, and my parents gave me books for Christmas every year. When I was in 7th grade, they gave me ""Southern Fried Plus Six."" I adored it. I did a book report on it for my language arts class, and while the other students didn't really get what was so funny, my teacher enjoyed it.I still have my worn, yellowed paperback copy, but this evening wondered if it was still in print. So glad to see that it is!I guess I would describe it as being in the vein of Eudora Welty (which is high praise indeed). If you think ""Why I Live at the P.O."" is funny, you'll enjoy this."
4,"funny, poignant -- a great read","I picked up this book on a whim and you should, too. These stories about the post-WWII rural South are often funny, sometimes moving and worth reading.The stories are short and easy reads, so stick this book on your bedside table and read a story or two each night before going to sleep.The only fault I had with ""Southern Fried Plus 6"" is that many of the settings and characters had a sameness to them. But this is a minor problem in what is overall a fine collection."
4,"Starchy tough, flat collar, boxy fit, but tagged","Looking for undershirts for my husband to wear under collared shirts. Nice starchy quality to the shirt, but boxy so the sleeves leave space and if the slacks are of a thinner material you can see some bunching when undershirt and collared shirt is tucked in. Also, there is a tag on the back which makes me wish that Hanes ComfortSoft tagless were cheaper because thats the only brand that tops Jerzees in terms of white undershirts."
2,Too small a diameter,The product was too small a diameter to cover the damaged area. Either get a larger unit or totally replace defective cover.
2,Nontraditional approach unexpected,"As much as I have enjoyed these two womens' vocals-and-guitar approaches (each on her own CDs), Drawn From the Well was disappointing. Just to put these two sublime performers in a studio/on a stage and let them do what they have historically done best would have made an exquisite CD. But Kate had to go learn violin, and Kat's now playing hammer dulcimer...Go figure! So the sound is more mellow (melancholy?)than the usual perk these two women offer. Admittedly, you may still like this new approach but it sure isn't what I expected."
2,Smaller than they appear,"For very light duty applications or apparel , this product is ok. However, about 10% were damaged and bent rendering them limited usefulness. The useful opening is barely 5/32 of an inch and the shoulder would easily pull through most fabric with little force. Definitely a decoration and very light duty low quality product."
3,It's okay,"Probably a third of the eyelets bent. That being said I was putting them in .06 kydex so I should have been using 3/16 not 5/32 eyelets. Overall though they did there job and I made 3 new sheaths with them. BUT if you are wanting to thread 550 paracord through it get larger ones, as it only fits 1 through once they are expanded."
3,Good product.,"Was trying to use with holster making , was not what I was needing . Needed to be a little thicker."
1,Sprayer,"I ordered this item because it was a gift from my children. I have not used it yet but I sure was surprised to see how low the quality is comparing price. I feel it is highly over priced, when the wand is plastic and it only has a 30"" hose on it.I hope that I am not more dissatisfied after I use it.I feel for [the price] it should have a metal wand and a longer hose.My old one that I am replacing can be purchsed for less than [this] and would have a metal wand and a longer hose."
1,Haphazard collection of cheap gimmicks,The book does not appear to be the work of a professional writer. It consists of one incredible event followed by another.
5,great book for fund managers & others in financial community,"the book makes for great reading as it takes you thru the financial world without really straining to understand its context within the story. it is a great follow-up to the author's first book, ""takeover"" which was a page turner itself"
3,Unrealistic Thriller,"Most of Stephen Frey's novels have the common thread of big time financial dealings. He manages to come up with different twists, plots and characters. This one is about a top Wall Street firm where the Senior Partner is planning to make billions thru devious and quite illegal means. Along the way we find the head of the CIA,who is running for President, implicated. Terrorists take over a nuclear facility as part of the scheme. Mace McLain is the hero in this read. He suffers from something common in Frey's writing. His hero's are just tooperfect and superhuman to be believable. Still, it's not a horrible read. But, not top notch."
3,Intriguing storyline that comes up flat.,"The Vulture Fund's basic storyline sounds intriguing and full of promise -- a successful executive is asked to head a venture capital fund earmarked for Manhattan real estate only to find that the source and destination of the proceeds are not eactly on the level. Unfortunately for those of us that are in the business, the meat of the story doesn't quite get your blood flowing. Frey assumes that every reader is experienced in the world of venture capitalists, and this leaves the story dangerously out of reach for most. All in all the story is a an average read."
4,GREAT READING,BOOK WAS VERY FAST PACED. EXCELLANT CHARACTERS. CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEW BOOK HOPEFULLY SOON TO COME OUT
4,This is a great read!! It definitely has a Grisham feel!!!,"This book touches on a lot of different subjects - not just finance - so its a fun read! It may be slow at spots, but hang in there for some cool action. I will definitely read this guy's next book and recommend it to friends."
1,Sloppy writing spoils a promising premise.,"I appreciate good suspense fiction, and this is not it! The book starts out with a fine premise but less than laudable prose. And the writing style only deteriorates. The last third reads like a hastily composed first draft--a barely fleshed-out outline. I couldn't help but conclude that Frey was in a big hurry to get this one into print, and so was his publisher, because no one polished or edited it. If I read one more time that someone's hand was ""large"" or ""huge,"" or that someone ""hesitated for several moments,"" I was going to recycle my copy. I don't care how successful Frey is, he should be embarrassed by the quality of the writing he turned in here. It shows a lack of respect for his craft and his readers."
1,Frey fails to deliver.,"Stephen Frey must have been in a big hurry to finish this one. Likewise, his publisher must have needed it fast. That's the only plausible reason something so unpolished could have gone to press. I like Frey's premise, but his character development, plot structure, and writing style are amateurish at best. I challenge anyone to track the point of view in this book! In addition, Frey manages to offend most female readers with supposedly high-powered women characters who are obsessed with pleasing a man. And the ones over age 35 are terminally depressed about their fading looks. Please! Frey makes Grisham look like a literary genius. I recommend instead any novel by Andy McNab."
2,"Cheesy. Yep, that about covers it. Cheesy.","Cardboard characters.Cheesy plot.Little or no basis in reality - like how would the CIA director (yet he's called ""General"" even though he's the Director of the CIA) who wants to run for President explain the hundreds of millions of dollars he wants to use for his campaign that he skimmed from his evil plan?This book is a little Iran-Contra, a little Trading Places and a lot of silly garbage all rolled into one.And - to make it all the worse, I heard it as a book on tape and the reader made nearly EVERY male bad guy voice the same - a raspy, impatient tone. Kind of like James Garner with a sore throat."
5,Survival of the Sphinx,"Jean Orieux's biography of Talleyrand reads like a novel, which, considering his subject, is only just. Talleyrand, descended from the cadet branch of a noble family as old as that of the king, survived and prospered under every regime in France from monarchy thru the directorate and Napoleon's empire and beyond. (On taking his oath of allegiance to King Louis Phillipe, Talleyrand remarked, ""Well, sire, that makes my thirteenth."") A major force in the post-Napoleanic world, his air of mystery and his laconic manner earned him the nickname ""The Sphinx."" In both virtues and vices, he was an odd mix; greedy, vain, amoral in many respects, but he had an iron will and an unquenchable love for France, no matter who ruled her. Orieux's book is both informative and eminently readable"
3,a great game for a while,"My grandparents bought this game to for me, my brothers and sisters,and my cousins. At first it was great! It was challenging. I got to leap across roofs, break codes, desguise myself, and do lots of other things. There were quite a few cool gadgets like a lipstick recorder, robot spy puppy (my favorite) and a perfume tracker. You have to find out who stole barbie's friend's fashion clothes. There are dozens of different outfits that you can choose from at different times. First you can do training so you know how to do spy moves, but you don't have to. It's easy to use. After I completed the mission once though, it wasn't as great. I don't play it much any more. If I owned it though, I don't think I would play it at all! I think this should be for ages seven and up, because of the hardness of the puzzles. Hope this review is helpful!"
5,Super CD-Rom,"Secret Agent Barbie was awesome! I love it! It is the best. Using your mind is really fun, unlike some other games. It is the coolest. I really like the game!"
1,Worse than pet rescue,"We have both pet rescue and this, and I will not buy another Barbie software again. This was confusing that my boy genius 7 1/2 year old is having trouble with it. I am finding more and more Barbie items a rip off."
2,X.P. Problem,"My granddaughter is almost eight years old and was thrilled when I got her this new game.She played it and after lots of frustration finally started to figure it out BUT my computer started acting up and the game had to be restarted twice.She got an error screen twice,that said something was missing,and it simply stopped.I was told it was Win XP compatable,when I bought it but NOT.what a waiste of money."
1,Unbelievably bad,"This game is SHOCKINGLY bad. Where do I begin? The graphics look like my CGA monitor circa-1988, Barbie's movement is herky-jerky, and half the time it crashes my PC. I don't know how you could more surely waste your money. Don't buy this abomination."
1,Beware - It Won't Work With Barbie's Genie Bottle,"I found that the cursor which controls Secret Agent Barbie's movements will NOT work if you also have the Barbie Magic Genie Bottle software with the Genie Bottle connected. The ""solution"" (which works) provided by tech support requires that you turn off the computer and disconnect the Genie Bottle before turning the computer on and starting Secret Agent Barbie. Obviously, to play Barbie Magic Genie Bottle, you need to turn off the computer and reconnect the Bottle. This is really unacceptable, particularly when this ""conflict"" arises from the Barbie software/hardware itself, rather than from some third-party product."
5,Has helped me and changed my way of looking at menopause and my body,"This book and ""What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Premenopause"", have helped me so much to know what is going on with me and my body and to assist me in finding ways to help myself. Topical, natural Progesterone has been a life saver, no more hot flashes or night sweats, and it is helping my mood to stabilize. His books explain the difference between natural and 'man made' and how the chemical composition needs to be the same chemical composition as created by our bodies. I refer back to both of these books often and have been taking vitamins and supplements. I have found these to be a wealth of wisdom."
2,WYDMNTYAM,"There is a lot of great information in this book, but when it comes down to dosing, I don't agree with Dr Lee. I have ready many books and done a great deal of research on bioidentical hormones as I have been suffering with severe symptoms since I was 36. On the other hand, hormones and women's bodies are all so very different and unique and what works for one, may not work for the other. My recommendation would be that if you read this book and try his approach without positive results, I would recommend reading ""Female Brain Gone Insane""."
3,"Good, but...","Very involved, pretty biased. I tried the recommendations without success. I may need something different hormonally. Not every woman needs progesterone to balance hormones."
3,Book review,"Book is helpful and has good suggestions for surviving the annoying effects of "" the change'"
2,Boring,"I was geared up to read this book cover to cover without wanting to put it down in between but was disappointed in that I found it boring to and NOT full of valuable info. (I was already aware of)! The author died in 2003, there's much better and updated versions of the info. contained in this book."
4,Good book for the change,This book is informative and insightful. This edition is outdated so will be getting the newest version shortly. Paper back makes it easy to read and set up so you can go right to the section you want. good read.
5,HRT,"This book was suggested to me by a friend, and it is wonderful!! I am tapering off the HRT with no problem. I LOVE THIS BOOK. The author explains estrogen and our need/or not for it. She offers actual help, and explains women's issues like no other. Book was shipped quickly and I have no problems with the seller or the book. Thank You!!!"
5,"Great Book, but Amazon beat it up.","A wonderful book to learn much about your own bodies hormonal system. Gain insite that is invaluable weither or not you are going through menopause. I am 29 and have had hormonal problems since I was a child. Now I am able to treat myself! (diagnosed PCOS, with terrible hot flashes and many other problems each month.)This book should be required reading for all young women so that they can take control of their own health. It would save many from the heartache of fertility issues, and also many aweful symptoms that some of us have gone through all our life."
2,Not for the normal women going through Menopause,"I thought this book would give me practical ways to handle this very emotional time in my life; however, it is a more clinical view of why Menopause occurs. I really don't care to know the biological reasons of why it happens; just give me plain words of advice to get me through it. This was not the book for me."
1,Is This a Book?,"Is this a book to help out women who suffer from being misinformed about menopause or an advertisement for progesterone cream? Didn't help me at all, if anyone wants to buy it, it's yours but I don't recommend it."
5,Great book,"What Your Doctor may not tell you about menopause is a good informative book. There is so much I had no idea about. I had two copies & loaned them out. I never got them back, so I had to get it again!"
5,Awesome knowledge in this book.,"I could probably type to my hearts content but I will not. This book is amazing, educational and worth it no matter what age you are. When my little girl is old enough to understand what her body is doing, her and I will read this together."
1,Not the best,These newly mastered renditions are horrible. Be careful when you look for these older songs that you get the original recordings!
3,does not spray the chemical if held at certain angle,"It sprays well if held slightly downward. However, if tilted at steeper angles toward the ground, it does not mix the chemicals and sprays water only. This became evident when I sprayed round up to kill weeds. After a few days, it was clear that only the midfield areas were properly sprayed but the edges, where I had to tilt to avoid spraying good grass, it did nothing but spraying water."
4,"Had problems, but finally got it right.","Do not buy from this vendor. Package arrived without the deflector, which makes the product useless. Package was not sealed. Proceed at your own risck. Total wast of time and money.Update: amazon was very helpful and cross-shiped a replacement product right away. They paid return shipping, but I had to run the package to the Post Office and they have closed the one near me.After recieving and using a complete version of this hose-end sprayer, I will say it is a very good product and works very well. In the end it was worth the hassel."
3,Poor quality washers are only complaint.,I used this sprayer heavily this summer clearing two large lots of all vegetation. Every month or so I wouldhave to replace washer in handle attachment to hose and the washer connecting spray bottle to handle.I tried various brands but within a few weeks they would leak a little and then a lot. Local store said theyhave had same trouble and gave me some updated washers but they didn't last any longerOne other little thorn is the dial that sets the mixture of spray to water gets gummy and hard to turn. Idon't know of anything better out there so will continue again next summer.
4,"No Problems So Far, Seems Accurate","Why did I buy so many plastic pump sprayers when I could have used this all along? Now I know better and so should you. Easy to understand mixing guide, just set the dial to the number of ounces of the product you intend to use to what you would have put in a typical pump sprayer for each gallon of water. Remove all parts when done and clean them with tap water. Why did I give just 4 stars? The spray handle the device is attached to is way too cheap for what could have been a truly fantastic product. Never too late to make it right Gilmour!!!"
5,Great for cleaning chemicals,"I use this sprayer to apply cleaning/sanitizing solutions in a commercial setting. I use relatively benign chemicals (oxyclean and citric acid) to sanitize winery surfaces but all the other sprayers I have tried use cheap plastic which corrodes from the oxyclean (a strong solution but nothing I wouldn't put my hand in) while the Gilmour stays perfectly intact. I'm not sure how accurate the dilution settings are, but you can definitely change the strength of a solution by twisting the dial. I use 160 degree water with oxyclean and it works great."
5,Works Great!,Thus far I love this thing. I was able to quickly spray all my plants to get rid of the bugs. I had to wait because it was on backorder but I'm glad I did.
5,Best sprayer I've ever used!,"I purchased the Gilmour sprayer after using several commonly-sold devices over the years. The Gilmour is sturdy, light-weight; it allows me to use any liquid with the appropriate mix-ratio quite easily and accurately. I did have to search for a conversion table to equate tbsp/teaspoons into oz, which was easily found with a Google search. All in all I'm very pleased with this sprayer! And buying through Amazon made my search & purchase a real breeze...I find I am counting more & more on Amazon!"
2,Junk..leaks,Not a good product as it leaks everywhere. Not much more to say it was not usuable as it would leak water and chemical from the top spout.
2,Don't bother,Seriously this product is not worth the money how can you put PROFESSIONAL on a product that is no better than the plastic bottle sprayer that products typically are sold with.
2,what a leaker,Sprays OK but every part of it leaks. Big dissapointment would buy something else. Not worth the price. This is my review and I am sticking to it
1,Water mixes with chemical.,"The water mixes with and dilutes the chemical.. It messes up the concentration.. Instead of wasting the chemical like the other bad sprayers, it dilutes the chemical with water from the hose.."
5,Finally Found it!,I had one of these years ago but lost it. I really like the convenience of not having to measure and mix. You can put the chemical full strength into the bottle and just set the number of teaspoon measures or tablespoon measure and simply squeeze the trigger. Nothing to it.
5,Long Lasting,"I purchased a this exact same sprayer some 15 years ago. The only reason I purchased a new one is that I lost my old sprayer in a move from our old home to a new. The sprayer meters the product in the jar very, very, well in my experience."
3,"OK, but","after just a couple of uses, I find it doesn;t jet as far as claimed. Maximum range is about 18 feet, not the 25-plus itsuggests. as I was spreading moss killer on an inaccessible roof, this was critical."
5,Works like a champ!,I needed a sprayer to kill insects on smaller shrubs as well as on a huge Oak tree and this sprayer handled both extremely well. The end nozzle piece turns so that the liquid sprays either downwards or upwards and can be taken completely off to shoot a 30 foot stream. It worked great.
2,Low dispensing rate,"It seems like a quality product made from good materials, but the design did not work for me. I was interested in spraying liquid fertilizer and a milk solution recommended to combat lawn mildew. For these uses, it took over an hour of spraying to empty the container even on the highest setting. This rate may be OK for spraying potent chemicals, but not for fertilizer. My water pressure is a bit low, so that could have contributed to the problem. I had to return it."
3,A little disappointed,"I own a lot of Gilmour gardening products and did not hesitate buying this sprayer. However, the first day i got it and try squeezing the handle a few times - nothing hard, just normal squeeze - and the little red knob that holds the handle in popped right out. I pushed it back in but it popped back out after a few squeeze. I know they have lifetime warranty but it shouldn't be this bad in the first place. Other than that, the whole thing seems well made"
4,Works as expected,The only thing I wish it could do better is the metering dial could go past 10 to allow even more chemical other than that it works great.
5,gilmour sprayer,This item works very well. I have tried two other brands from the local store and both had all plastic parts. The Gilmour has some brass nozzle parts which do not leak as the other two brands. Also the other two products had to go back to the local store because they failed to work after two applications to my yard. This is a great product and I endorse you selling it with five points out of five. Thanks for selling this item. Delivery was as sited and the package arrived in good condition.
4,Gilmour Sprayer,"An excellent sprayer that allows 10 different mix concentrations without diluting your concentrate. Didn't use it all? Just return leftover to the original container. Another nice feature is wide spray and heavy stream; this lets you reach second story walls with soap solution (and bleach) to kill mold. It is important to clean the unit well after each use, otherwise the filter screen will clog. The only reason it didn't get five stars is the on/off valve triggered by the handle. After about 2 years of use it starts to leak at the seal (only fresh water leaks out) and can't be diassembled for repair. Still a great product."
4,"Handle made in China, bottle in USA","Unit works well.PROS:1. Top dial selects the dilution rate i.e. number of tablespoons or teaspoons (if you insert the small restrictor into the siphon tube) per gallon of water. You may need to do a bit of math if the instructions that came with whatever you want to spray are in fl.oz/gallon or similar.CONS:1. Unit will leak contents through small hole in top of valve if tipped over i.e. if you put the hose on the ground and bottle lays on its side. Understandable why - just worth being aware of.2. Although the description on Amazon says ""Made in USA"" it is (currently) only the plastic bottle is made in the US, the handle is made in China (so I'm knocking off a star - probably should be two stars but the unit does work well - so far.)"
3,Robert Mitchum IS Philip Marlowe,"Unhampered by Production Code restraints, this 1978 version of Raymond Chandler's novel is more faithful to its source material than the 1946 classic with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Viewed today, the contemporary London setting works in director Michael Winner's favor. Of course, the film's raison d'tre is Robert Mitchum's second go-round as Philip Marlowe - an iconic portrayal that perfectly captures the world-weary spirit of Chandler's famous detective. An excellent supporting cast includes a poignant appearance by James Stewart as General Sternwood. The 1978 ""Big Sleep"" will not erase memories of Bogie and Bacall, yet it makes a surprisingly effective companion piece."
5,Eyes of the Beholder?,"I thought this was a very good movie and a credible remake of the original. I've watched this on numerous occasions as I have the original.Maybe I've led a sheltered life and I'm certainly not a Siskel or Ebert. I don't share the negative reviews on this movie.Buy it, and make up your own mind."
3,Big Sleep with Robert Mitchum,"This movie lacks the punch and mystery of the original Bogart version. Mitchum seems to be wooden in the role of Marlowe, the whole production looks like a ""play version"" rather than the usual movie polish version ones expects with movis. There is added nudity in the movie but this seems to detract rather than add to the original version.Still overall not a bad movie but I would have to go with the Bogart version anyday over this one."
3,Robert Mitchum - a first class Marlowe,"Though I agree that this DVD is not as good as ""Farewell, My Lovely"", it still is superior to the Humphrey Bogart version. Bogart was very good at playing many roles, but 'The Big Sleep' comletely missed the mark. The ending of the Bogart version is almost criminal and completely corrupts the rest of the movie. Compare the 'Hollywood' ending of the Bogart version with the novel's famous last paragraph being read by Mitchum in this one. It's unfortunate that the rest of the movie was not up to Mitchum's level but it is worth owning another Marlowe movie with Robert Mitchum. Watch the original because you like Bogart/Bacall, but if you want to experience The Big Sleep, watch this one and buy the book (you'll hear Mitchum's voice as you read)."
1,What happened?,"Nines & Sixes was such a superb piece of work. It's so refreshing in today's bubble-gum pop market and ""wish-I-was-hardcore/ghetto"" rap rock to hear albums like that, displaying a band that dares to be different. But apparently Mock Orange didn't want to be different anymore. This CD screams ""WE WISH WE WERE THE BEATLES!!"" Save your money. I wish I did."
2,For lovers of classical music,"Chopin's music is very relaxing to listen to and is also excellent as a background to other activities. This particular disc however does not really come up to my expectations for two reasons. Firstly, some of the performers feel that an exhibition of their finger dexterity is more important than an expression of feeling and melody and tend to rush through some melodic pieces, losing a lot in the interpretation. Secondly, the recording itself appears to be rather uneven in volume and it becomes necessary to continually either increase or reduce the listening volume."
2,Todos Vuelven DVD Part One,"Ladies and Gentlemen- I am giving a fair review of the Ruben Blades ""Todos Vuelven-Part 1 and 2"" DVDs. He's certainly our legend on Salsa music. I really waited to receive those DVDs on my door from UPS. To my surprise and although the quality of the music on the DVD is okay, I am really disapointed that Ruben Blades and his production team put out such a poor quality DVDs on what I categorize as ""the best concert of his lifetime."" The video quality of the concert is poor. I attribute this to the poor production of the video recording. It should had been on HD as a minimum. I will still treasure both of those DVDs and add to my collection of music concerts, but wished this was done at a better quality and also done on one disk instead of 2 separate ones."
1,Mala calidad de audio!,"Me parece inaceptable que esta producción salió al mercado con audio en estéreo en pleno año 2011. Recuerdo que el álbum Siembra en acetato y años después en CD, fue producido en el año 1978 y tiene hoy día una de las mejores calidades de audio producidas hace más 33 años. ¿Cómo es posible que saquen al mercado un DVD con esta calidad de audio? La calidad del video tampoco es de lo mejor pero se puede tolerar, pero el audio en formato estéreo me parece una enorme error por parte de los productores. ¿Qué ocurrió con la tecnología disponible actualmente como Blu-Ray?En mi humilde opinión, si eres exigente con la calidad no pierdas el tiempo con estos 2 DVD. Mi decepción ha sido a tal grado que el Volumen 2 de esta producción, ni lo he visto, ni creo que lo haga.¿Cuándo podremos contar con un concierto de Rubén grabado en Blu-Ray con audio en 5.1 Surround o DTS Surround?"
5,Unbelievably good,"I don't know where Budha Building came from or if they are still making music but this CD is so amazing I'm ready to have their man-babies.I heard the track ""Slowest Possible Groove"" on internet radio and purchased the CD based on that. I popped the CD in on my drive home from work and was astounded at how good this album is. Pretty much every track is a winner with production values on par with Thievery Corporation.This is creative, non cookie-cutter electronica with grooves and atmosphere. I hope there is more Budha Building music out there somewhere I can add to my collection. One CD would be a sin."
4,Shock MOUNT,"This is a very good shockmount cheapest youll find but still from BLUE. Really GOOd, Wouldnt tRade It For The World"
2,Songs I didn't Love,"I've seen him twice and enjoy his voice, but I found it hard to enjoy these songs. Love songs thrive on familiarity and these were not familiar. No better after a couple of listens."
5,Smooth,"I have purchased many CD's by Aaron Neville with no regrets for any of them. This artist has a golden throat and his music is uniquely different from any other artist. His style and the sounds has a relaxing tendency with what I can only describe as ""beautiful music!"" His work is so versitile covering many different genres. No matter what he sings, it provides the very best in listening enjoyment. Aaron Neville, I thank you for your contributions to the music world."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book for my dino-enthusiast after he saw it at a book fair. A must have from the outside- but once in, my child lost interest. The overlays are really cool and we revisit them often, but the CD, which makes you think there will be many activites has only view and a slideshow of sorts. The kids can see how the skeleton moves and then that's about it."
3,"""interactive dinosaur cd rom"" my left foot!","My son is currently really into his dinosaurs, so I picked this particular book because I like the way it was laid out, it is visually stimulating, and it does have plenty of new information in it for him to devour... and as a BONUS, it came with an ""interactive cd rom"". Sure, it was slightly higher priced than some of the other options, but I justified that added expense because it came with a cd rom. Totally disappointed with that ""bonus"". Most likely the lamest excuse for a cd rom ever, in the history of computers. I have seen student created power point presentations with more pizzazz and with better graphics than this. It's just a few picture slides of dinosaur bones! Do not buy this particular book with the thought in mind that you might enjoy the cd rom, because you won't. My boy was pretty bummed out... and I feel silly for falling for the gimmick. Three stars because the book is cool, but aren't most?"
4,"UM, YEAH THIS SPEEDMASTER; hang on yo my comment before any purchasing here!!","I am liking it, and estimate will continue to like it. It is a great gift to celebrate my study at the Harvard University with an A experience! I am liking it and so far this first twelve hours I have not have any issues with it yetSept 5/ 09.

4,My Main Complaint is It's Too Short!,"Trippy-hip lyrics, poppy beats great for practicing the lost art that is pogo, catchy guitar solos, infectious tunes that infiltrate your mind and leave you with Manplanet fever; this band is ear candy with added nutritional value. Forget Eminem, and grab this bag of Skittles-colored men who pound out power-pop like there's no tomorrow. Influenced by glam, early-80s rock, and a strong dose of Jetsons retro-chic, Manplanet takes on pressing modern-day issues such as space exploration, Minnesota landmarks, robot angst, and cheap sci-fi thrillers and emerges victorious in a flash of smoke. Of course, the only way to get the full Manplanet experience is to see them live, but for those of you who live outside their touring area, I suggest you buy this EP, light a couple sparklers, and dance the liner notes around in front of your face. If you don't wanna do that, just buy this EP."
5,Amazing,"This band is fantastic to see live but their music is well worth getting this CD for. This is a great EP and a ""must"" for any good CD collection. Buy it! You won't regret it."
4,Great Live Band!,"I saw these guys play in WI and loved their performance. If you get a chance to see them, do! They sound sweet and innocent, like Weezer with a more spaced out tone. The lyrics are spacey and really easy to listen to. I love the colors and hope you like it as much as I do! Although there are only 5 songs, go ahead and buy it! You won't regret it, I promise!"
2,What's the message?,"I'm confused watching this. Is the message that children shouldn't be on medication? If so, then I don't understand why the parents allow children to be medicated! The message I'm getting is that these parents are complaining about how children shouldn't be on medication yet they continue to feed their children 8-9 prescription meds even in the documentary. These children don't have to stay on the meds if it's not working for them or have too many side effects.Everyone knows medications come with side effects. You don't have to be a doctor to know that."
1,a wicked waste,"i should have shredded $ and saved the shipping fees.this is a 30 minute collection of very bland and repetitive anecdotes about 'ma' and 'grandmas' obession with mah jongg-nothing about the game itself.the only thing that exceeds my folly for buying this video,is the audacity of the producers for putting this item on the market at all."
5,HADLEY IS AWESOME,I have been looking for this artist and finally found him on Amazon. This is a wonderful artist and the music is fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to kick back and drift away with the melodies of this artist. THANKS!!!
5,"I LOVE this, and roll with laughter each time I read it.","After I read this book, I looked for everything I could find from Mr. Schmitz. I still do, and am still vexed that there are not more things to read. I laugh just thinking about this book STILL. Am I glad it is to be republished."
5,My favorite book...ever.,"I have the original 1966 paperback. I have to buy a new copy so that it won't fall apart. (A 40-year-old paperback can only take so much use, after all!)The word for this book is rollicking. You have high adventure, amusing characters, lighthearted moments and good triumphing over evil. If you liked Princess Bride (movie or book) this is similar in tone. I just wish they'd make the movie, already!"
2,A Disapointing Rediscovery,Having read and enjoyed The Wiches of Karres as a teenager I looked forward to rereading it again 30 years later.Unfortunatly I was quite disappointed.Interesting story but poorly written.Bad and hokey dialogue.Characterizations pretty much nonexistent.And Baen typically packaged it with godawful cover art as usual for them.Readers of Baen books will probably like the book better since most of their writers are at the bottom end of quality in the SF/Fantasy field if you are looking for some degree of literary ability.Pick up some Neal Asher or Iain Banks instead.
5,A true classic science fiction novel.,"One of my favorite science fiction novels of all time, and one that has not achieved the recognition it deserves. A galaxy-sweeping plot is combined with creative concepts and interesting characters to form a satisfying blend that is found only in the very best science fiction"
1,Save your money,"I bought this album for around $7 and have listened to it maybe three times. (forcing myself the second and third to see if I liked it) They're sappy love songs with no magic, that show that james iha's tallent in music is not strong in song writing. The songs that are credited to james on the smashing pumpkins albums are great songs, recognized by Billy Corgan as great songs, with producing credits to Billy as well. However, ""let is come down"" does not measure up to the quality of james iha's smashing pumpkins work. You can see that james was not the driving force behind the quality of the smashing pumpkins. It's a shame this is the man who broke up the band ( billycorgan.com ) since he's not the man who made the music great, which you'll understand if you listen to this album. I'd rather listen to the guy with the acoustic guitar that stands outside the movie theater near me every friday, then listen to this album again."
2,Ret it come down,"James Iha's voice is too limited to be used on an entire album. I doubt he could even get a job singing backup vocals on ""Me so Horny"" for 2 Live Crew. The music is bland and weak, like a bad cup of coffee. The only good song he ever wrote was ""Summertime,"" and that isn't even on this album. Buy this if you like hearing people with Japanese accents sing country music."
5,No Noisy Angst-Ridden Egomania for My Sweet James!,"Just sweet, soothing, engaging melodies from the ""the Quiet One"" (I think of him that way, anyhow, compared to Billy Corgan!), whose work with the Smashing Pumpkins I have always enjoyed. I wish he'd put out another solo album like this!Oh, by the way, not only is his songwriting persona very endearing, but James is very handsome, too!"
5,ZZZZZzzzzzzz................One hell way to relax!,From this album you will know where the rage and the melancholy from Smashing Pumpkins comes from!!....Touching yet disturbingly beautiful tones from the lead man.....
4,Surprising,That's the only word I can use to describe this cd. Iha sings like a modern day Manilow. Good sweet sounding stuff though
4,Rocking Acoustically,"If you think that Whir is the greatest song the Pumpkin's ever wrote then this album is for you. James writes beautiful little country-ish mostly acoustic songs with none of the angst or weirdness of the Pumpkins. Sweet without being sickening these songs will not change the world or incite people to re-think the meaning of life but they make a welcome break from whining baggy-trousered 30 year olds inflicting their ""issues"" upon the masses."
4,In Response to those *die hard* fans,"There's no point in expecting James to spit out pumpkins style songs in a solo album. this is something he did to get away from all of that, so just listen and appreciate the lyrics, and take a few minutes to get used to his notso handsome voice."
4,Let It Come Down is a little slice of pure pop heaven.,"James Iha's solo album is quite the departure from the elegant noise we're accustomed to hearing from the Smashing Pumpkins. Melodic guitars meld with the occasional country twang to produce a sublimely happy aura which permeates each song. Very reminiscent of the pop you used to listen to on your A.M. radio in the seventies, Let It Come Down reminds us that people haven't had enough of silly love songs--and what's wrong with that?!"
1,Horrifying!,"When i heard about the imminent release of James' new CD i couldnt wait to get it...when i did get it i listened to the first song and thought...ok this isn't very good...but theres a whole album left to listen to....by the time i reached the last song i was utterly disgusted. I am a very serious Pumpkins fan, and i think they are one of the most talented and original modern bands...i always thought James' songs from Pisces Iscariot etc..were slightly below the standard set by Billy...and i didn't expect James' solo album to be quite as superb as the Pumpkins...but i was dismayed at how utterly horrible this album is...James' voice is nothing special, if not annoying...he's one of those guys similar to a lot of english indie bands who can just about get away with calling himself a singer.... If James wasnt in the Pumpkins, this album would never have been released...i advise you to check out Jeff buckley or Nick Drake."
5,Science Kit,The kit is easy to use and the supplies needed to make and learn from your science project is included. There are many topics to choose from.
3,Hard to figure out..but fun,"I enjoyed the game because you could swap characters at any time and the game was interesting. The one aspect that I did not enjoy was trying to figure out what to do with all the items you pick up and trying to figure out how to combine them and use them. (i had to rely on a online game review to tell me how to combine items- especially hard was trying to figure out which of the 3 characters needed the item). No replay value, but fun for a one time game if you dont mind the old graphics and want to play a suspensful game."
3,Martian Gothic - Not a laughing matter,"From playing the game I've gotten very frustrated with it. You have to watch each character as the Vita Base members get up after being shot down. I enjoy the game only by wanting to solve the grotesque mystery along With Karne, Matlock and Kenzo. Very interesting but very frustrating."
4,chris daniels'music and games,"The Game is good,I Want to know is it a video game call PayDay?And if it is what game console it's on?Payday is like monopoly but different,it's a board game and i thought it'll be out on video game by now like monopoly and The Game of life.I got the board game but is it on video game?Thankyou by Chris Daniels"
2,Waste of money,"Leica makes great cameras, butnot great tripods.This is a small stand for your camera, but you could easily use somethign else. It's also very unwieldy to carry around due to its shape. It's just not functional enough as a mini tripod.Skip it."
4,Riveting,"Princess Alice's claim to fame in our current times is that she is the mother of Prince Philip - Duke of Edinburgh, consort to Queen Elizabeth II. However, she also was a Princess of Greece and like the woman who inspired her (Grand Duchess Elizabeth of Russia - her aunt), she also did a lot for her adopted country Greece inspite of the uncertainity of the Greek royal family (they went in and out of exile many times).The narrative is dignified. Although it flattens in a couple of places it pulls through largely in part because of the remarkable story it tries to tell.All in all, it is a wonderful story of a remarkable woman. This book opened a door to all the other wonderful people who make up her family. Each and everyone of them with their own remarkable lives. I would also recommend byElizabeth: Grand Duchess of Russiaby Hugo Mager for anyone who is interested about how Pricess Alice was inspired by her aunt."
3,Informative but Long,"This book was a very detailed account of the life of Princess Alice of Battenberg, who married into the Greek Royal Family. This complex and fascinating personality makes an excellent subject for a biography. However, I felt that the account, though full of information, could have been shortened slightly and still would have given us enough information."
2,"interesting subject,badly written,boring",if you can get thru this book it has some interesting info but it is very badly written
3,"Interesting, but .........","I love reading biographies about women and I thought this would be interesting. It was, in some respects. She lead an interesting life - certainly a typical royal life with a little mental illness thrown in. But it seems the reader needs to have a companion book to sort out the relationships between all the royals in all of Europe. Every page had a reference to somebody who was related to somebody else - all people I haven't heard of and frankly don't care about. But, hey, that's me. If all the name dropping was eliminated, the book would have been much more readible."
3,Sadly stilted writing style,"Princess Andrew of Greece (Alice) was both royal matriarch and mystic...a veritable enigma within a sprawling family whose interests rarely delved into the spiritual as did her own. Unfortunately, the Vickers' writing style is slow, plodding, and makes Alice's life a chronicle difficult to read. On a positive note there are many never-before-seen photographs, many from the Duke of Edinburgh's own photograph collections. One of the most striking is Alice at the coronation of her daughter-in-law Elizabeth...wearing the full habit of an Orthodox nun. Still, the writing is not a pleasure to tackle, so be warned."
3,Great only for new home buyers,"Although the description of this book is that it is useful for all home buyers, in truth, it is only useful for those looking for buy a new home. The first few chapters talk about new and resale homes, but after that the entire focus is on new homes. If that's what you want, this is a good book. However, if you're looking at resale, don't bother buying this book."
2,Weird title for book about building your own house,"I bought this book because it was highly reviewed and by the title I would have imagined it was the perfect consumer's guide to learning all about mortgates, real estate markets, first time home buyers programs, what ""points"" are, how the inspection process works, financial pitfalls, how to pick a realator, what steps to go through when you are going from renting to buying, the bidding process, etc and found very little on these topics within the pages. The title is completely misleading. This book is about how to build, repair, and do structural assesments of houses. The author is a builder, and builds houses. His expertise is in building. He spent more pages talking about drywall than mortgages. If you are building a library of home buying books, this might be the 25th or 26th book to get because it deals with construction, but if you are buying a house for the first time, save yourself the hassle of returning this and don't buy it."
1,skeptical,"As a prior David Weekley homeowner, I was amused to discover this title among the construction offerings. Based on Mr Weekley's reputation as one of the country's largest privately-owned builders, I purchased an almost-new Weekley home in Florida. Within a year of moving in, the roof was buckling, structural and design errors, water intrusion and toxic mold forced us to evacuate the home. The only hammering I heard from Weekley representatives, was the hammering of contractors working on leaks and other structural defects."
1,Reliability,Initially there was a problem with the on/off switch which caused the shutter release to operate inconsistently. After repair by Leica the camera operates superbly. Lens is super sharp.
4,"Minilux, what to expect","This is a handsomely styled camera, complete with that Leica look. You don't have to spend this kind of money to get good pictures but the lens on the minilux is really superb. If you value a fast, sharp lens that gives you that Leica look in your photos, then it's worth the money. Most amature photographers look for a camera with a zoom lens but if you want lens speed that will pay off in low light this is the ticket. There are no perfect cameras. That is, one that can be everything to everyone. The Minilux has a small viewfinder, no information in the finder and a not so easy to set exposure compensation. All the titanium bodied compacts are for looks only; they are still just as delicate as an ordinary plastic camera. I have experienced no problems in using this camera and am always amazed with the results. Sharper than my 50mm Nikkor."
4,Therapy as hypnosis,"To excessively summarize and perhaps engage in slight hyperbole, this text is about how therapy is, even in therapies that espouse total neutrality, an attempt, conscious or not, to semi-consciously convince the client to change through influence. The text concentrates more on paradoxical interventions and on communication theory than on hypnosis (there is not much hypnosis, if I remember correctly), but the idea is that therapy is a form of benevolent, partially conscious influence. Essential to the thesis is that every behavior is a communication, and that different styles of communication can get tangled up. The therapist's job is to sort them out and then come up with communications that the client cannot help but obey, even if they think they are disobeying (paradoxes). This one goes along very well with the book by Beier that I have reviewed, but is much more focused on directive client influence than Beier's book. Definitely worth a look."
3,Not entirely worth the money,"The kit doesn't warn you you'll need quite a few extra supplies before starting, which seriously delayed the fun on Christmas morning. And the experiments are ones you can find pretty much anywhere online. My daughter had more fun creating her own experiments with the supplies provided than following the instructions. While I'm glad I purchased this to find out about it, I don't think I would purchase another of these kits."
3,* Patch available for Pentium 4 chips *,"For all those people having problems with this game on Pentium 4 computer, there is now a patch from VUgames that you can download. I'm happily running this on a P4 using XP and DirectX 9.0c and it runs fine. Graphics are still a little coarse, but quite acceptable given the standards used when the software was written. My daughter is now very pleased, and hopefully this information will help make some other kids happy too. The game is a good way to learn some of the names of the moves. Cheers!"
4,woww.,"I used to play this game all the time when I was younger. It was really fun and I loved it but somehow it got scratched and didn't work anymore. But otherwise this is a great game. And to the chick who said that its unrealistic, like how would you know your on level 5 im a level 9 gymnast and it's a game like why would they make her do sit ups and push-ups and all the other stuff you mentioned."
1,Doesn't work,"Simply put, this game did not work on our computer. Bad programming, guys! My daughter was so disappointed. You'd think that with all that money that parents and kids are spending on Barbie products they could at least afford to get the game right."
2,such a fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i love this game. i used to play it for hours choosing outfits and moves and practicing and even getting trophies and ribbions and beat the other girls. yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i hate that it stopped playing my new hp cd-rom DVD-ROM COMPUTER. DONT GET IT if you have a 64mb ram or 128 mb also you must not have directx 9.0 its terrible at installin and read the agreement to know if you need a 24x speed and it might send viruses to your enternet especally dsl, comcast, and platnium windows. so your taking a risk. hope i helped!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,less of the same...,"I was quite impressed by the first album by Abilene, so when I heard there was a folowup album, I was very exited. I searched high and low for info and song samples on this album, and it seemed to slip under everyone's radar on the internet 'cause I couldn't find anything. I ended up buying the CD and now I know why! It's a rather mundane, tiresome effort, apparently stuck in time (like around the ""heyday of Crownhate Ruin"" timeframe). Fred Erskine's somber trumpet is only a sad punctuation mark on the tiresome sprawl of this album. Dust off your old June of '44 debut album if you're in any way tempted to get this one."
4,Absorbing,"A rip roaring,absorbing historical novel filled with action and adventure, as we follow the adventures of the young Norseman Hakon and his friends. Hakon is struck by lightning which due to Norse superstition makes him an outcast. He is later seized in a raid by the Drakkar vikings, sold into slavery and taken to Miklagard (Constantinople)and joins the Byzantine Emperor's elite Varangian guard. He returns later to Norway with his Welsh companion Cabal and reunite up with his friends Olaf and Ingolf and his enchanting beautiful sister Kari who marries Cabal, after which he raids the Welsh coast with Cabal and then is lost at sea landing up in Mexico of the Mayas. Fulling of exciting journeys and the clash between the Christian religion then invading northern Europe and the ancient Norse paganism, bloody battle scenes and vivid descriptions of new destinations. not quite an epic but an absorbing, exciting, hard to put down work of historical novel."
1,Take a pass on this one,"A third of the way into this book I was wondering ""where is the real Paul Watkins, and what have you done with him?""Watkins is my favourite author by far - but I wish I had never read this book. It is so gawdawful cliche. Relying on improbable coincidence after improbable coincidence to keep the 'plot' moving.There is none of the trademark Paul Watkins setting of time and place in one's mind with excellent writing. Very little character development, weak plot lines, historical inaccuracies, and weak attacks on politically correct targets.In short if you are a Watkins fan take a permanent pass. If you have never read him, don't start here or it will finish your interest."
2,So-so,"I struggled to read this book, having to overcome the handicap of actually knowing something of the history and religious beliefs the author uses to flesh out his story.For one major example, extant evidence leads us to believe that Germanic beliefs were polytheistic (many gods), not pantheistic as Watkins describes (i.e., that they saw godhead or lifeforce in everything). His depiction of the origin of the Nordic pre-conversion belief is simply preposterous.Thunder God is an average story with shallow characters and short on detail. I found it lacks the grit and realism of Household Gods and the historical accuracy of Severin's Viking trilogy- books that have in abundance what this book tried for."
4,"Mellow songs, zippin' tune sets","I wouldn't have minded hearing what Brothers 3 can do with a fast song or two, but the overall effect of No Turning Back is a good one. The band definitely has a handle on mixing traditional, rock and jazz styles, and I look forward to hearing more from this Texas septet!"
4,The Fibromyalgia Nutrition Guide,"I found this book to be tremendously helpful. The information on diet, nutrition, and herbs enables us to make sound choices when it comes to the foods we eat. This book made me feel more in charge of my prognosis. There are plenty of delicious-looking recipies for lots of different types of meals. This was a very easy read (even with fibro-fog) and the information was very well presented. There is a heavy emphasis on the author's personal experience which seemed like too much at times, especially since the degree of success of any particular course of treatment varies so much from person to person. However, I believe this book will be helpful to all who suffer from Fibromyalgia because better nutrition gives the body a much better chance at fighting any illness."
4,Great information,This book is full of useful information and it is written in a way anyone can understand. Thank you so much to all who help with this disease.
5,Where Did They Find These Voices?,This CD is HOT! Who would have thought the Naval Academy had such talent within its ranks! Feel Free To Purchase this CD! You won't be dissapointed!
3,Designed to make you read it,"Many keywords aren't italicized. None are bold. There's no glossary of terms, but there are 20 pages of references for the theoretical student who likes comm. theory enough to seek further reading.It seems like it could be organized better, but maybe the authors structured it this way so that students can't skim it and find relevant information - but rather must read entire pages (unless they search with google books).Much props to the author for not doing a new edition every year like many publishers are now, and hence letting a good used book market build up for it."
2,not too happy,"I am in college, I ordered this book the day my class started and a week later he is finally sending it. which means I won't get it until next week so I will have to read about 4 chapers. which isn't too bad if I did't have work and other classes."
5,a great book on living systems,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Certainly there is no shortage of books describing what the human race is doing to itself and the other organisms that inhabit our planet. It can be depressing reading most of the time. This book, however, managed to put all of this into context, and surprisingly, made me feel that all is as it should be in the grand scheme. It is a wonderful synthesis of past and present scientific revelations, intuition, and even religion. Do yourself a favor and read this book."
3,Hildegard for experts,"This book was well written and readable. I have 2 problems: not enough information was given about life in convents at that time, and the author assumes the reader knows as much as she does about her subject. Both of these are probably due to the author's enthusiasm and depth of knowledge about her subject. But I need the Intro to Hildegard, not the advanced version."
3,I'd Reccomend CD2!,"Who listens to those big old long boring remixes? Who cares anyway? It's just boom ba da boom the whole song with the artist's voice (in this case, Kylie, whos awesome!) just repeating the first setence of the song over and over and over. 1) COME INTO MY WORLD(3.5/5) It's a good song but I really prefer Love At First Sight other than it. 2) COME INTO MY WORLD ASHTRAX MIX (4/5) It's better than the original, and it's not the repeating stuff. Its almost like a radio mix except a minute longer. 3) COME INTO MY WORLD ROBBIE RIVERA'S HARD & SEXY MIX (2/5) This is a great example of what i was talking about. Repeating and boring. 4) COME INTO MY WORLD ENHANCED TRACK (2.5/5) I have to say, this video is pretty boring. Its just Kylie walking around an intersection and shopping center and everything doubling when she goes for the next lap. Well, CD2's better with live versions of Love At First Sight & Fever but some people might like this, this was just from my point of view."
4,Surprise--Another Hit!,"Kylie hits the right notes with this song. The original song is pretty amazing, though I can't help but think the intro to the chorus involves some 'sampling'--just haven't figured out what is being sampled. If you enjoyed ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" & ""In Your Eyes,"" you'll surely snap this smoother, softer-toned pop song as a fave (but be prepared for the ""la la la"" bridge...it's back!). The remixes are fun, with high-voltage beats that go on forever...very club-scene. And the video is interesting...just have to keep watching it to figure it out. A must-own for Kylie fanatics. And a great stocking stuffer, as well!"
1,Ouch! Terrible. Here Is Why.,This is not the Bee Gees. This is not a good recording. This CD is abysmal. I wish there was a NO star rating. Save your money.
2,Low Quality,"Before you purchase based on the other 5 star reviews, which is what I did, you might like to know that this item is made in China and the glaze is hit and miss leaving bare spots along the rim and clumpy areas elsewhere. The overall quality, including chips in the base rim of the plate, is not above any item you would find in the cheapest section of your nearest ""deeply discounted items"" store. I, personally, would not be proud to give this item as a gift. It gets two stars because the overall design and function areas are good.....but not good enough to overcome the flaws. True, you are not spending a bundle of bucks here, but I'm sure that you could find a better choice if you keep looking."
4,What a cool product!,Convenient way to thaw my frozen berries and easy way to serve fresh berries. Only tiny gripe is I wish the dish was a bit deeper for thawing out the frozen berries.
5,eternal death!,"this album is amazing! you can't believe it's their first album. every song is amazing, one of the best death metal albums i have ever heard. amazing sound, guitar,drums etc. a must have!"
1,How do these things happen?,"I've been listening to various selections from this album over Internet radio, and finally had to comment to prospective buyers. I have great respect for Rampal, who plays well on this album, but the recording is just, in a word, poor. Specific problems: Poor audio quality (did the engineer not know how to place microphones?) and the orchestra sounds like it didn't even tune up before the recording session began. Frankly, the recording is offensive to the ear. I won't be rushing out to buy this any time soon..."
2,Poor Audio Quality,"I picked this up in the bargain bin- why not right? Well, even with the equalizers and stereo volume adjusted, it still became very frustrating to listen to a poor recording."
5,Full Use of CD-Rom in Windows XP,"It is not possible to install the cd-rom program in Windows XP. All the features can be accessed, however, directly from the CD-Rom. Place the cd-rom in your drive and open the folder named ""DA"". Right click on the DA.exe icon and select ""Properties"". From the properties menu you can select Windows 95 compatibility. Then double-click on DA.exe and you will get the opening screen. From there all menu items are fully functional in XP."
5,Wowee!,"This is AMAZING!!! The book's nice enough in itself, but the real reason why you absolutely have to buy this if you're at all into Doonesbury is the CD-ROM. We're talkin' every single strip from the beginning 'til '95! As you may know, it's virtually impossible to assemble a complete collection otherwise--there are jillions of books, nearly all of them out of print, and if you stick with the larger anthologies you'll find that many key strips are quite absent. Quite a must-buy, this is..."
3,the CD-ROM is disappointing,"I really enjoy this cartoon and so I immediately purchased this item, but the CD-ROM baffled and infuriated me. There was no way to navigate around the CD, so one just has to enter in a subject at random and be satisfied with the strip that pops up. Also images appear curiously low on the screen and there are no scroll bars on the side of the screen so a user can move up. Perhaps I got a defective CD."
2,Where's the Mac? Why the rehash?,I too was annoyed to find that the first 2/3 of this book rehashed the Virtual Doonesbury and Planet Doonesbury books I already owned. Even more irked to find the CD doesn't support Mac users! It's still Doonesbury and these are great strips but I wish Trudeau would think of his FANS when putting these books together. I feel betrayed!
2,CD can't be installed,I can not install the CDRom under Windows 2000. Its asking for windows 95 and ends installation with the message that SHADOW causes a failure in module TMP340E.EXE on 0003:1092 and will close.That very disappountingIf someone has a solution then please let me know.
2,the dark and evil empire has entered the guarded realm,"As has been said previously, the new strips were great but the rehash of strips from the previous two books was very disapointing. next time i ill review more carefully before buying.Now the bad part, what the F*** is going on when You can't read doonesbury on a mca but you can on a Wintel machine. Read my heading and you will understand. I was very disappointed as were a number of other friends of mine."
3,Dirt Devil a bit heavy!,"Love this product for picking up scattered cat litter but wish it were a bit lighter. Also sweep motion loosens handle from base, and needs to be tightened after a few uses. Great for getting stuff up from between the floor boards on wooden plank floors."
5,great product,"Love this broom vac, even picks up debris on my foyer rugs. Works great on hardwood floors and stairs. Now I don't even use my full size vacuum in any room with bare floors."
1,"It Picks Up ""NOTHING""!!!!!","What a concept, a broom that sucks up the dirt while you're sweeping! Only one problem, this unit just sucks! I can't count the times my wife and I have commented how we threw $50 away on this piece of junk! It barely (I repeat, barely) has enough power to vacuum up small pieces of dirt! And yes, before you ask, we have kept the filter clean and have emptied the dirt reservoir regularly. We had it for a couple of years now, and occasionally we'll pull it out, give it another try, only to say again ""Wow, wish we hadn't blew $50 on this thing!"""
2,Broom Vaccum Doesn't,Thought this would help keep things neater. Have 2 dogs that shed. Suction doesn't work well on dog hair. Gets clogged a lot. Works best with regular types of sweeping - simple things like a little dust in the bathroom or crumbs in the kitchen.Don't think that I would have bought this if I had been able to try it in a store first.
5,Love it!,"Living on a ranch, I get a lot of junk tracked into the house. This handy broom vac lets you do a quick clean up and be done. It has been a life-saver and works great on my hardwood floors."
3,Dirt Devil Broom Vac,1. The Dirt Devil Broom Vac does not sweep like a broom -- the brissle are to hard to sweep.2. The suction window or filter on the Broom Vac is to small -- I think it would pick up better if the window or filter was larger.3. The Broom doesn't get close enough under the cabnits to sweep or to suck up the dirt.4. You give instructions about the dirt cup but not the filter -- can you wash it? How soon do you need to replace it?1. The Broom saves you back -- take out the Broom Vac instead of a large vacuum cleaner.
1,dirt devil,i bought 1 for my mother and it is terrible. i will not buy these for anybody. it does not keep the charge at all. i charged it all night and it ran for 5 minutes that it.
3,Needs redesign,"We have hardwood floors and dogs, so there's always hairballs in the corners. I thought this would be a great daily quick sweep, but the design makes the hair clog very quickly. If there was a tad more room between the filter & the tunnel where the dirt is sucked up, the hair wouldn't accumulate so quickly. Seems like this would have easily been noticed in the design phase. Otherwise I really like this product!"
4,Beats the old broom and dust pan by a mile,"I buy a lot of stuff at Amazon online because I trust them. I ordered this item several weeks ago and it was delivered promptly. Amazon does that very well -- and it qualified for free shipping, I am a 70 year old man and have two cats that leave an abundance of scattered dry food, cat hair and litter on hard serface floors. The Dirt Devil broom vac does a good job on all these items. I haven't had a chance to use it in other situations but I am confident that it will work well. It takes a little practice to get it to work as advertised and you also have to get used to it being heavier than a regular broom. That isn't hard to do. The overall engineering of this product is exceptional and is easy to use , clean and empty. I will buy another one if I ever wear this one out."
3,Does it work on cat litter?,I was thinking about purchasing this vacuum after seeing it for a low cost of $25.00 at Walmart. Our cats have their own little kitty closet with their cat box in it but it gets filthy and they drag the cat litter everywhere on the hardwoods. I was looking for something easy to clean up the cat litter. Does anybody know if it works well with picking up litter?
4,Very convenient,"This is my second Dirt Devil Broom Vac. I had to replace my first one because the battery wouldn't hold a charge. Other than that, this product is very convenient and easy to use. I keep it handy to sweep up smaller areas between vacuuming the entire house with my full-size vacuum."
2,"It sucks...no, really","This little baby was going to make our evening kitchen clean up routine so much easier. When I got it in and charged the battery as specified in the instructions, I discovered it's really a piece of junk. The battery does not power it long enough to finish the job and the tiny pleated filter clogs up so quickly that you find yourself standing over the trash can beating dirt out of the filter more than you are sweeping. I have to admit it's still better than using an actual broom and dustpan, but if you are looking at this product I would try another one."
3,"Dirt Devil MBV2030BLK Rechargeable Broom Vacuum, Black","This broom vacumm is a glorified dustpan. First off if you dont keep it fully charged at all times forget it it wont suck a crumb up. Second if you dont keep the filter inside clean at ALL TIMES or after each use it wont suck up nothing but air. If you do do these two things it works ""ok"" but after 10 minutes of use I find myself losing suction. I have had this since mothers day and I still use my broom more than this item. You are better off using your house vacuum cleaner with better results and save your self the 50 bucks you would of spent on this. Hope I have cleared any doubts (good or bad) up any one may have had."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wanted this broom the minute I saw the TV commercial. I quickly assembled it - the only positive thing I can say about it! - and became quickly disappointed in it's cleaning ability, once I had it charged. It does not pick anything up. I have tried different angles, sweeping, putting it on top of crumbs. It would be faster to get out my Dyson and vaccum my tile and wood floors. Better yet, I will just use my broom and dust pan."
2,Waste,I dislike this item. It's pretty heavy for it's size. You have to hold it pretty much straight up and down to pick up anything. I always resorted to a broom.
3,"A rechargeable ""broom"" that makes sense","Clean ups are fast and easy with my Broom Vacuum. No more cords and loud noise to do a quick clean up. On the down side....fuzz, hair and crumbs stick to the filter so that it needs to be cleaned often. However, I don't mind since the Broom Vacuum is a good value for the money."
1,HATE IT -- If I could give it NO stars I would have,"I was VERY excited to buy this. The good reviews def. outweighed the bad reviews with this product. So when I finally got it, charged it and used it, well tried to use it I WAS SO MAD!!!!! Not only is it HEAVY but the suction is less then ZERO! I thought well maybe I'm doing something wrong, actually I was hoping that I was doing something wrong...NO I wasn't. My husband gave it a shot then my sister gave it a shot. This vacuum is WORSE then AWFUL! It's TERRIBLE!!! Believe me I'm not looking for something like a Dyson, I was looking for something similar to the Swiffer. BIG MISTAKE! Don't waste your money. If I could have given it NO stars I would have but you have to at least give a product one star. I'm going to buy another Swiffer."
2,Suction Power Lacking,"I rec'd this item as a wedding gift. At first, I thought it was great because it definitely beats using a broom and dustpan. However, I quickly learned that it has major limitations - notably its suction power, and the fact that hair and other items are constantly getting stuck in the bristles.Also - it doesn't run very long on one charge, and immediately loses its suction power at that point. I'd much rather suffer through the inconvenience of a cord, rather than have a vacuum that loses suction power so rapidly."
3,A Dustbuster On A Stick,I'm a little disapointed with this purchase. It's basically a heavy dustbuster on a stick. You have to manever it completly upright and directly in the middle of the broom for it to pick up/vacuum. If this was a twenty dollar item i'd be satisfied but fifty bucks was too expensive.
1,"If I knew how, I'd send it back!","This is a broom vac. It doesn't take anything up unless the broom is held directly over the dirt, etc. It is awkward to use and the bristles aren't long enough! I regret purchasing this product! Don't do it!"
1,Poor design,I was thilled at getting my dirt devil broom vac and as soon as I got it and charged it for the 24 hrs as reguired I started to use it. I was very dissapointed at the amount of times I had to go over smaller particals the size of peas several time just to get the thing to pick the items up. Also very poor design in the filter system. The little flat that opens allowing what particals like hair and dust to get up in the cup go directly onto the filter and stay there blocking the flap from closing and particles fall back out. No way does this machine pick up M&M's like on the comercial or a pile of dirt like they do either. Would not recommend.
1,New highs of sucking (and that ain't a compliment),"This is probably the WORST product I have ever used. I have 2 dogs (one that sheds) and wood floors throughout my whole main floor so I am always looking for a product to assist a quick clean-up, and let me tell you, this ain't it. You are supposed to use it as a broom to sweep everything into a pile than you are to turn it on to suck it all up. Does it suck it all up, you ask? The answer is no, it just plain sucks. It also sucks as just a plain broom. I should also mention it is horrendously hard to empty the little it does manage to collect and if you do have dogs, the hair sticks to the broom. My solution to all this electronic stuff that is supposed to make your life easier is this: a broom and a dust pan. I know, because I have tested everything out there."
4,Great for Pet Owners!,I purchased this after having a less than stellar experience with the Hoover Slider. We have 2 dogs and I was looking for something to pick up the dog hair between cleaning lady visits. This works fine. The pet hair actually goes into the dirt collection area and not all stuck on the brush head.
2,Marketing Marvel,"What a gimmick... marketing hype. The instructions suggest you use the ""broom"" to sweep and then turn it on and it'll inhale your crumb pile. One can do that with a regular broom and a handy vac... but here you don't have to bend over. Not to mention, you'll get a nice workout wielding the thing because it's not light. The broom handle is somewhat slick and slippery. It works fine on low pile carpet if you use the thing to 'scrub' back and forth the way you would with a floor vac. If I had a chance to try it before buying, I would have passed on it... 2 stars because it does work."
2,save your money,"I was so excited when I saw this product on tv.A friend and myself ordered ourselves this broom in DEC.2006. WE both hate it,it is heavy and clumpsy to use.I thought the reason it was no good for me is I have pets,I tried it on the bathroom floor but it was too heavy for me I just went back to my vacuum it was much lighter and easier. |My friend always has a spotless home,no pets or kids she wanted to use it after dinner for the kitchen floor.She hates it.|She feels it is useless too,it is such a pain to use because it is not lightweight like an electric broom should be.I am so happy I had time to cancel my orders for my daughters at the holidays once I got mine and knew it was no good.Neither one of us use it."
3,Not that impressed,"I just bought this broom vac by Dirt Devil after watching it's super cool commercial from last week. I thought it would be a great product to use with my hardwood floors b/c it's light and not too bulky like the vacuum. Also, I wasn't a real big fan of the disposable swiffer pads, b/c I don't like to touch the 'icky' stuff stuck in the pad when it's time to replace it.With the broom vac, I liked the idea of not having to touch the 'icky' stuff, and the fact that it sucks up the dirt from the floor. The only down side that I am not real imprssed about after having it fully charged is that it's really not that strong to pick up anything like small pieces of paper, tiny leaves by the door way, or food crumbs off the floor.Maybe I bought a 'dud'. I will probably have to keep it for another week or so just to try to adapt to it or at least try to like it, but if I don't it's going back to the store."
2,Wife desperately wanted it - now she wonders why !!!,"At the request of my wife, she said she NEEDED this item!! As the loving husband I am, I went ahead and purchased said item and I have heard nothing but complaining since it arrived in our household.Number of times used - 3.Number of (*&^%$# about the Dirt Devil Broom Vac - off the charts.Yes, it is smartly designed but has poor suction power. It is also incredibly loud for such a small home appliance.Final thoughts? Take the time to either sweep up the spill or pull your vacuum from the closet. It's not worth purchasing."
2,Cat Litter,"This is the fourth Dirt Devil Broom Vacuum in two years. I needed to buy something to pick up the incessant cat litter from our black granite floor. It was so troubling my husband dreamt that we covered the entire floor with cat litter since it was a constant cleaning battle!It works really well for a few months then progressively putters out around the six month mark. Instead of buying another and tossing this one in the landfill, can you imagine a mountain of these multi-colored vacuums?I'm trying another brand which was rated very well by Consumer Reports."
1,Seems like there is a design flaw...,My new home is 80% hardwood and I bought this product primarily for my kitchen. The filter clogs continuously and the suction does not seem powerful enough. The tube that brings the dust and dirt into the canister seems too long and the filter gets clogged up easily with dog hair and dust bunnies getting jammed between the end of the tubs and the filter itself.There must be a better product.
4,great product!,This is a great quick clean up tool! We have a Roomba and prefer the broom vac. My husband actually uses it more than I do! We have two dogs and they bring in a lot of sand and of course there are the fur balls.The charge holds extremely well. It is well worth the price and we both recommend it.
2,It sucks - I don't mean that in a good way!,The suction power is horrible. I have wood floors and the stupid thing wont even pick up a Cheerio unless you run over the same spot about 4-5 times. You end up just sweeping it around with the broom bristles.
2,doesn't suck,"It is not what I thought it would be, the suction is poor and the broom does not fit into corners at all,making you finish with a regular broom.Not a time saver at all, a normal broom is quicker."
2,dissapointing,"The idea of this broom vac is that you first use it to sweep everything into a pile, and then you turn it on and vacuum up the pile. I guess I thought you would sweep with the vacuum on, and it would suck stuff up as you swept. Not so. It is ok if you are just sweeping up some spilled cheerios or something, but it is way to heavy and awkward to sweep your whole kitchen floor. The vaccum gets clogged up with stuff pretty easily, and then, all the stuff you just swept up gets dropped back out when you turn it off. The nice part is that you don't get left with that thin line of dust that you can't seem to get into the dustpan."
2,WARNING - Can't buy replacement gasket!,I bought this broom vac a year ago and it works so-so. After using it for about 3-4 months the rubber gasket between the motor compartment and dirt container rotted and cracked losing all it's suction power. Royal WILL NOT sell the gasket by itself! You have to spent $35 to buy a whole new dirt container. So all I can use this thing for is a 10 pound broom. Save your money and your patience and buy something else from a company that won't rip you off on replacement parts. Sheesh!
4,GREAT BROOM,"..i purchased this Broom Vac at a great price,..because Amazon had dropped the price! Anyway...there are some really great pros about the broomPros-super easy to put together-easy to charge the broom-picks up really well-love the fact it sweeps and then can pick up.-does a great job picking up food, especially on my hard wood floorsCon-kinda heavy (which is why i did not give it 5 stars)-also does not pick up well on floor rugs-overall i love the broom and it works really well. I have 3 ferrets and 1 dog and it does the job very well. I would for sure recommend this product to someone else!"
2,A vacuum that unfortuantely doesn't suck,"I am having all kinds of problems with this. Unless I wash the filter, the sucking action on this thing just disappears. Is anyone else having this problem? It's incredibly annoying."
2,Only fair not good,"I read the reviews on this and it seemed like it had what I needed. Good suction, able to pick up cat hair and dust. It did state that the vacuum had to be held in a certain way.I bought it on Amazon but from Macy's. I thought I was getting a better model because it was $70 as opposed to the others for $50. But there clearly is no difference. So stick to the lowest price you can find. If you buy this at all.It does pick up if you are careful as to the angle of the vacuum, but you constantly have to clear out the filter and it is just plain dirty. If you have 3 cats as I do, and lots of dust, it clogs easily and then there is not suction.The only good thing about this is that it is cordless and light weight, but a broom and dustpan work just as well and less frustrating."
3,Dirt Devil broom/not too bad,This item is good in that the battery lasts a long time. On the other hand when using the broom you need to empty the chamber often. The unit has a filter that is too close to the intake area which causes it to clog up with dirt and not let more into the chamber. The flap on the top of the intake area hits the filter and only leaves a small area for the dirt to enter. Other then that one flaw this is a good product.
2,It is not as good as I thought,"It is not convenient to use, it is heavier than a broom, plus the brush is too hard and short. It has less power than regualr vaccum cleaner, and the battery run out so quick... I have to return it."
3,Make a great dust pan...,"I purchased this as a quick floor sweeper mainly for pethair in the tiled kitchen and hardwood foyer. As a broom, it's kind of awkward to use. It doesn't really have the bristles to actually sweep and you can't get into tight spaces.. But if you've ever tried to collect dog hair tumbleweeds in a dustpan you know that the sweeping motion makes them blow away so the suction of the vaccuum is a nice solution. What I do, use a good quality nylon broom and make piles. Then I suck up the hair and dirt with the broom vac, think dustbuster on a stick. This works nicely and I think I've gotton my money's worth from the product.With pet hair, the dust cup area fills up fast and tends to clog in the opening. It is easy to empty; however.I would probaby buy another one if mine broke but as it doesn't replace the broom."
2,Disappointing,I found the broom/vacuum cumbersome due to it's weight - it is heavy! To sweep my first floor using this is a workout - and it really hasn't saved my back from not having to bend to use a dustpan - my arms just get sore. The price was right but I wouldn't recommend this to a friend.
1,Not acceptable,"This sure does not work like the commercial showed. It is heavy, on/off switch is not convenient. If I had to do it again, I would not buy this. A dust buster at much less cost works as well as this dust buster on a wand."
1,not a happy camper!,"This Broom Vac was great while it worked. I bought this from a seller named Lightville on here, and I either got a dud or a used one that was old because the battery won't hold a charge not even six months later! Urgghh."
2,Loved it for a short while....,"Received it as a gift about two years, and it was great at first but then just stopped working after a few months. Very disappointing."
5,LOVE my BROOM!!!!,"I love this broom, it's exactly what I was looking for. Sometimes I don't feel like pulling out that big old Kirby and this is just the thing I need for small messes!Excellent product!"
3,could be better,"This is really handy. Yes, it could hold a charge longer and it could have more sucking power and my red charging light already doesn't work------but, it is convenient and easy to use."
1,Cute Red Broom,I was very disappointed in this broom. I works more like a squeegee than a broom in that the bristles are very short and don't move. It is messy to empty. It's cute but I don't use it. I would not recommend this broom to anyone.
2,Degined by a man,"I purchased a DirDevil BroomVac recently. It does what it is designed to do, which is small areas and it works good on stairs. But this product is clearly designed by a man. The chamber is difficult to open and empty. The vacuum housing where the chamber is attached to is heavy, making it hard to hang on to when you try to open the chamber to empty the content. You need a large hand to handle that. Mine gets dropped almost every time. So, if you are listening DirtDevil, a product not only need to be functional, aesthetic but also easy to use for the users it intend to attract. A handle of some sort by the chamber would be helpful..."
3,Good but not a replacement for a Broom!,"It works well if the big things are picked up. In order to use on tile it has to be on it's side and doesn't sweep like a normal broom, although it does work for pet hair on hard floors and for that stubborn little mess that you can never seem to sweep into a dust pan!"
1,Don't waste your money,Bought for my wife and it is usless. Short battery life and poor suction. A total waste of money.
2,Just pushes the dirt around.,"This broom was mediocre from the word go. It's awkward as a broom but the vaccuum power was so weak that sweeping was pretty much its only use. Basically, you could push the dirt around (though not as easily as with a simple $7 corn broom) and it would suck up a few crumbs and that's kind of it. It wasn't broken, it just didn't work very well. There are no pets or young children in the household so it wasn't on heavy duty either. It was only used for cleaning the edges of the living room and a tile entryway and it didn't do that particularly well. Sadly, we didn't think to return it in time and about two months in the suction got even worse but we were stuck with it. The idea is good but it just did not work for us.Save your money and skip this one. (We ultimately bought a corn broom and an 18-V B&D; handvac to take over edge and entryway cleaning. Neither is as convenient as this product should have been, but both work well for their purposes.)"
1,This vac sucks - because it doesn't,I bought this vac to suck up dog hair from my tile floor. It would be easier to pick it up with my hands. If there's a huge puffball of hair it will probably get it but just a few random hairs? - they'll be left behind. A bread crumb? No way. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option. DO NOT WASTE 1 PENNY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
2,Not worth it,"This broom vac is basically an underpowered dustbuster on a stick. It's not a broom at all - there are no real bristles just a strip of foam. It will pick up dustbunnies, but most of the dust and hair you ""sweep"" up just sticks to the foam strip and does not get vacuumed up. You could do a better job with a swiffer, which is cheaper and much lighter. This item is quite unwieldy and will not fit into or under tight spaces. I have gone back to cleaning our hard floors using a combination of a real broom and vacuuming up with a B&D dustbuster, a swiffer for dust, and then every 1-2 weeks vacuuming with the dyson. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it's not broken it's just not a useful tool."
1,"Nice idea, but doesn't work","I like the idea of a combined broom and vacuum, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well. Dirt just gets pushed around and doesn't get sucked up unless you position it exactly right. I've gone back to an old-fashioned broom..."
3,It's really 3.5 starts...,"Okay, after reading everyone's reviews I went out and bought the broom vac. I'm taking it back today. I bought it to sweep up hair left in the bathroom every morning. It works but it's very heavy and it feels a little odd. Also, the handle kept unscrewing and that became annoying. I wouldn't say don't buy it but at 50 bucks, I just don't think it's worth it. I'll just stick to my wooden broom and my wonderful Dirt Devil Scorpion."
2,Short battery life,"It was good while it lasted, about 6 months, maybe.The battery can no longer hold its charge, not even for 1-2 minutes. It's pretty sad, waste of money.You get what you paid for I guess."
2,Clumsy,I am not impressed with the Dirt Devil Broom Vac. It is heavy and very awkward to use. Stick with your dustpan or get a cordless floor cleaner that works on floors and rugs.
4,Very Nice sweeper,I really like this sweeper it works great for cleaning up dog and cat hair the only thing I do not like about it is that the hair just all goes into the chamber and sits there up against the filter instead of falling down into the part that should hold the dirt so you have to empty it every time you sweep or else it looses suction but it is still a nice little sweeper.
1,VERY WEAK,"Is not powerful enough to do a good job. You have to clean it after you use it 5 minutes and re-charge it again after 20 minutes or so. I wouldn't recommend it, since if your looking for a vacuum, this won't do the job. Not even if your looking for an efficient broom, is faster with a regular one.Is a nice size though, you can reach those small areas on the bathroom next to the sink and in the kitchen between appliances."
3,cj review,"Broom vac has been very useful in small jobs, but, the battery only lasts a short time so you have to get the dirt swept together first before you turn it on otherwise you will run out of battery power."
4,Dirt Devil broom really convenient,"We love it! The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star rating for us is that the overall weight is a little surprising, understandably, but by no means forbidding. The fit of the handle into the base is a little loose, and the weight of the base unit makes one think that it is falling off until one gets used to it. It works great! It is even fun to use."
4,Dir Devil Broom,"Hey, it is not connected to a short cord. I like it as I can use it on stairs to basement. Since I have a handicap the not having to bend over to clean up dust piles is great.I am cleaning up after just me so I haven't really given it a big workoutso don't know my feelings in the future.Dislike hepa filters. I COPD, a lung breathing problems so dislike the dust falling out of the heppa filter when cleaning out.But I bet a lot of people feel this way about floor and carpet cleaners."
5,dirt devil,this is a great product. i have wood floors and a dog that sheds. i just flip it on and run around the edges of the room to pick up her hair.....
1,BROUGHT BACK TO THE STORE,I USED THIS FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND GOT TIRED OF IT NOT HAVING ANY SUCTION POWER. I RETURNED IT AT WALMART AND GOT THE VACUM SWIFER INSTEAD. IT WAS 20 DOLLARS CHEAPER AND WORKS A WHOLE LOT BETTER. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. THE COMMERICAL IS SO DECEIVING FOR THIS ITEM. WILL NOT PICK UP DIRT AT ALL!!!!
1,not worth the effort,I got this for Christmas and used it once and returned it. It was way too heavy. I would rather use a broom and caddy than pick this thing up. It would be good if you want to use it for exercise though :)The suction wasn't strong enough to me either. I would say spend the money on a stick vaccuum than this broom vac.
2,Don't Buy this Broom,"Consumer Reports gives this ""broom"" high marks. For most purchasers this product, within a matter of days, will never be used again. Suction is limited, you have to brush in a specified direction and you'll have to fiddle with the angle of the brush head just to encourage it to suck up any debris.This product is destined never to be used again after its first use. It is one of only a few products which I've ever encountered which was recommended by Consumers Reports that disappointed me. I view Consumers Reports as a valuable resource but this is one of those rare cases where I felt the magazine lead me astray."
2,I couldn't be more disappointed!,I have had this broom for 2 years. I never use it and plan to resell or give it away. The suction is poor and awkward to use (doesn't get in corners and impossible to pick up from underneath low tables and baseboards). It doesn't hold a charge long and is so maddening to stop and charge in the middle of sweeping. A plain broom does a better job! Don't buy--it's a waste of good money.
1,Call this a broom?,"You can't ""sweep"" with this broom. It would take you forever to push/pull it over the floor and hopefully pick up something. I used it once and gave it to freecycle. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!"
2,Good broom. Poor battery life.,"We purchased the broom in early '08. It worked fairly well for our wood and tile floors. About what we expected. However, after about 18 months the battery went. There is no way to replace it yourself. The factory gave me the number of a repair shop. They said forget replacing the battery, it's less money to buy a new one. There you go. If you think the price is worth maybe up to two years of use, buy it. We did not think it was worth replacing ours. The old broom and dust pan are pretty inexpensive."
4,nice,"What can I say about a product like this? It works, was not expensive and is durable. Only good for small areas or rugs"
2,Not the best,I was so excited for this product...but after a few times you have to really clean the brush that actually sweeps the floor. I have only had this for a few months and it's already beat up. I hae a one bedroom apartment with a five lb dog...i need something better then the broom vac.
1,Dirt Devil Broom Vac.,Horrible! Does not pick up dirt or other items on the floor/rug unless you continually run it over the spot again and again. Was told by Dirt Devil to bring in for service but basicly this is a lousy product that is not backed up by the company. AVOID!
1,"Good idea, but needs improvement","I had high hopes for this product, however, I was sadly disappointed in it's performance. They made the intake area at the bottom of the broom way too small. If the intake went across the entire bottom to suck things up, it might work better, but as it is, it can barely pick up anything."
5,perfect for tile in my kitchen,"This broom vac works great for the new tile in my kitchen. I've used it multiple times already, and I have only charged it once (the initial charge when it arrived). I use it with the suction feature on, and work in sweeping motions, just like a regular broom. Works great for my small space!"
3,Its just ok,"This was ordered for the convenience of having a broom that I could use instead of a broom and dust pan. The design is poor I think, I thought you would be able to use just like a broom but you have to use upright to be able to pick up dirt when used correctly it works great also I wish it came with a holder to hang it out of the way. I feel like the stick holding the base it going to break in 1/2 that it slightly bends when using.. Over all it ok but I would not recomend this untill they make some improvements."
1,Terrible batteries.,After 6 months of use the batteries go kaput. This has been true for two different units. Not of much use with that short of life.
1,Poor design - disappointed that I can't get my money back,"The vacuum is VERY loud and has a high-pitched 'squeal' (unsure if that is proper spelling). Hard to unfasten to clean vacuum, and it's impossible to remove the dirst from the brissles, as well as the filter cup. This thing takes more time to clean (itself) than cleaning the floor (myself). Basically disappointing."
1,waste of money,"Over a year ago, I bought this broom for $29 after reading the reviews. It sounded like a good product. Unfortunately, I never quite utilize it mainly due to the weight of the broom. It is too heavy for my wrist and it takes more time for me to clean up. I still haven't figure out which angle is best for suction. I had charged it for days and it can only be used once. Maybe I received a defective product?"
1,Awful. Just awful.,"Why can't I give this vac zero stars?? I bought this broom vac when I moved into my new apt. I used it about 3 times and was moderately satisfied. Then the battery died. Permanently. I am writing to Dirt Devil about this problem. I do love my Kone, however, which is also made by dirt devil."
2,Neat concept; but just a heavy broom.,"Ended up giving it to my parents and buying the Shark. Liked the concept of the broom with a vacuum, but tends to get just a little heavier as you keep cleaning. Not such a great job cleaning around the edges of the tiles and doesn't pick up as much when on a low angle. Just not bad that's all."
4,Good for cleaning up after kids,"With three children under the age of 5 in the house, I always have crumbs and cereal and such around the kitchen table. The Dirt Devil is able to pick up everything that slips through their little hands. I have been very satisfied using the Dirt Devil as a day to day picker upper between floor scrubbings."
5,LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!!!!!!,"I have 2 small children and I have to sweep my kitchen after every meal! The broom vac does the job perfectly! I noticed a comment about the bristles being short so you can't sweep with it. The trick to that is to turn it over. It will sweep great then you can just suck up the pile after you are done sweeping. It was a little heavy feeling for about the first week, but now, I don't even notice. The canister holds a ton so you do not have to empty it very often and I just rinse everything out in the sink every once in a while. The filter has held up great to repeated washings. The battery also holds the charge for a long time. Using it 3 times a day, the charge lasts about a week. If I have a large job, I will sweep with it first and then vacuum. It is easy to turn on/off with your foot. I even use it for touch ups on the carpet. I have had the vacuum for about 3 months and I am buying every woman in my family one for Christmas.LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!"
4,***Good Concept - Works For Me!***,"This is basically a broom with the added benefit of not having to use a dust pan at the end. After reading some of the reviews it is obvious many people have not read the instruction manual. It clearly states the user is supposed to sweep dirt into a pile (like a conventional broom) and THEN use the vacuum feature to pick up the debris. This is not intented to be kept ON the WHOLE time you are sweeping - the battery will die out quickly. For what it is designed and intended to do it performs quite well. Much better than carting around a full-size vacuum on hardwood floors and allows you to reach areas most vacuums have trouble with such as near table legs and cabinet kick-panels. It is also easy to empty, but make sure to keep the filter clean or you will lose suction (like any other vacuum)."
1,Dirt Devil Broom a BOMB,"I was so excited to buy this adorable broom for help with constant sweeping I do following around two small children....well, the broom could not be more disappointing. The broom barely picks up common crumbs, and is awkward to use. You never seem to have it at the right angle to pick up anything. I found myself almost spoon feeding the broom--it hardly works!! The suction is so bad it's unbelievable--whatever you do, do not buy this thing, it's a waste of money. I only wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing. It's so bad I have wrote a letter to dirt devil complaining."
1,dustbuster with a handle,"I was disappointed with this 'vacuum'. I expected more of a vacuum cleaner, this is just a dustbuster with a handle. I have to go over and over crumbs to get them up, it tends to just move them around. It's a pain to clean out the cup. There is a rubber seal around it which is difficult to put back in place after emptying and I don't think will last very long. The inside filter is paper which I think will clog pretty quickly and is not replaceable."
3,Great extra vac,"I really like it. I use it to clean corners that Roomba does not get into or for quick clean up of small messes. It will pick up dust, dog hair and small dirt, but it has problems sucking up bigger items like pins or big crumbs, and sometimes dog hair gets stuck in the opening. But I still think it's excellent as an extra helper for hard wood floors and tiles. I would not buy it for carpets though, as it's not powerful enough,"
2,Save your Money - Wait for Improvements,"I bought this because my childrens food crumbs were breaking my back from having to bend down with a dust pan and brush and pick them up. I thought this broom vacuum would help because I wouldn't have to bend down. I still have to bend down because it doesn't pick up some of the crumbs very well, it ends up just pushing it around. The dust pan and brush still works better and is more efficient than this broom vac. I get frustrated using it on my kitchen floor and always have to resort to the dust pan at the end since pushing the particles around is not what I'm trying to achieve. I'm sure Dirt Devil will make some improvements one day on this vacuum. I'd wait for the improvements."
2,Disappointed,"This is not any more effective or helpful than an ordinary broom. Pushes the debris around, weak suction. Save your money."
3,Clogs easily,"The broom works well, the basic problem I have is the tube clogs with the dog hair and then it doesn't pick up. I've tried turning on the vacuum while I sweep and It helps somewhat, but still if there is a large clump of hair it can't pick it up."
5,Simply amazing,"Absolutely essential domestic reissue of Fridge's 1999 instrumental masterpiece. Masterful mix of electronica and rock that brings to mind post-rockers like Tortoise, but with minimal high-brow. Second disc includes tracks from even harder-to-find import EP's, as well as two previously unreleased remixes. Also highly recommended from this period is Fridge-man Kieran Hebden's solo project Four Tet. The 'Glasshead' EP is amazing, too. Kinda like electric Miles Davis with bigger beats."
4,drifting along with Fridge,"deep, colourful displays of pastoral audio smattered with organic beats and a warm atmosphere; not to mention a keen sense of melody. at times, displaying a jazzy feel and at other times a more post rocking dub sensibility. this is certainly too active to be considered 'downtempo;' but the music is certainly moody. perfect headphone music for a rainy afternoon."
4,bleeds true red..,I disagree with some of the other reviewers. This guy bleeds NDN red with his guitar. I think he channels stevie ray in his music.. I highly recommend his material.Tsayoga
2,Not for use with a timer,"I had one of these put ahead of a Gilmour 9400 timer on a hose bib connection. BAD IDEA. The timer shut-off causes a lot of water hammer and this broke the tee. That is, the hammer, after about a month, caused a crack in the tee that allowed a LOT of water leakage.If you're just looking for a tee for convience then this is a nice one. The knobs on the valve are big and easy to use.Just DO NOT use it in a constant supply situation where there will be any sort of hard shut off as the plastic WILL crack."
1,2 have broken this summer,"Simply put, this is a cheap piece that breaks under regular use. It's a poor value. I've replaced two in three months."
2,"Liquid Hair Wax, Literally","I love Aveda, but I do not love this particular product..I think they need to go back to the drawing board on this one. My hair was sticky all day..it felt horrible and left a gross residue on my hands. I would not recommend this product unless you really like the greasy dirty look"
1,Doesn't even work,"I'm using this product correctly and all that comes out is water. It leaves the vast majority of fertilizer in the jar and doesn't distribute it. Easily fixed but still annoying, the tube inside doesn't touch the bottom of the jar so you can't use the last gallon or so, ASSUMING that this would work in the first place!"
3,good for residential use...nothing more,if you don't baby the plastic lever that controls the water flow on and off you will mend the plastic waaay to quick. it's good for personal use but not for commercial spraying.
2,defective ... and leaky,"Worked okay the first time I used it. With the second time and about 1/3 through the solution/jar contents, I noticed it stopped distributing the mixture as the level did not decrease at all. It even looked like it was adding water to the jar. Noticed that the trigger area was leaking, too. Also, amount sprayed did not fan out well/consistently, even though we have strong and consistent water pressure. It would start strong and then ... a pathetic spray. Valve/trigger area very problematic. Will try to return."
3,Nothing to Compare Performance,"I question whether this product works as intended, as there were no instructions or directions included. It works good? I guess so."
5,I wish I was back in Hawaii,"When I am missing the islands of Hawaii, I play this CD. Thanks to the wonderfully talented group, Na Leo, I am never far away from Hawaii, its culture, and its people.Thank you, Na Leo, for sharing your part of the world through song."
3,"Fun, but will lose interest quickly","My 6 (almost 7) yr old got this game for Christmas, and she loves it. However, I can see that some of the games are getting old already. I don't see this as a game that she will want to play over and over for a long time."
2,dissapointed,"just read a 3 star review exclaiming how story was flat and production value decent...i disagree in part. i thought everything just sucked. production was just ok as the animation flowed poorly and stiff during most of the series. i essentially judged a book by its cover and the 5 star compliments and was later disappointed by lazy animation that had but glimmers of hope. by the way, ""sucked"" was how my wife described it...i've only stomached 4 episodes so maybe my rating will improve later."
1,THIS IS NOT GENESIS!!!!,"I want to give a HUGE warning to Genesis fans: This is not, I repeat, NOT the Phil Collins/Peter Gabriel band with Rutherford and Banks that gave us over 25 years of classics like ""Supper's Ready"", ""Illegal Alien"", ""Jesus He Knows Me"" and ""Dancing with A Moonlit Knight""!This release is from a talentless rap group or solo rapper who sounds more like a crazed homeless who unlawfully steals the band's name just for the sake of trying to sell more records! What a horrible album title too! I swear that these guys don't even know how to use proper grammar!!Avoid this trash altogether! How dare they use Collins' and Gabriel's band name! I expect a lawsuit to be filed in the near future! End of story!"
3,Good product - somewhat misleading,"I bought this poduct about two months ago and, for the most part, it does what it is advertised to do. I have been able to use three different media card types (by far the most frequent is a 128 MB CF card followed by a 512 MB CF card ). My computer easily recognized the new drives and never skipped a beat.The issue that I have had more than a couple of times is the actual writing to the disk. I expect that, when the file transfer progress box goes away, that the files have been transferred to the card. I many cases, this is not an appropriate assumption. Instead, when you pull the card out, it waits for about thirty seconds and then flashes up a message box that says the files were not written and no data was transferred. It works if you wait for about two minutes after the files have ""finished"" copying before you pull the media card though.Still, I have to dock 2 stars for the card reader not doing being able to achieve it's primary task."
1,what a let down,"I pre-ordered this wonderful weird sci-fi film months before it was released... only to find, as have so many others it seems, that the disc will not play in a DVD player. I thought the first disc was defective and sent it back in exchange for another copy, but that one too won't play, and went back to Amazon for a refund. I hope someone wises up and releases this movie in a format that is actually watchable!"
1,"GREAT MOVIE, BUT DVD WILL NOT PLAY!","I was excited to see the release of this classic, but the DVD will not play on the three DVD players that I tried it in. I bought two copies of the DVD and neither one of them would play. I'm not sure of the technical reasons why this is, (another reviewer goes into more detail as to why) but be warned! this disc may not play on your player. It's really unfortunate because this film is brilliant. My one star review is for the DVD quality only - not the film itself."
1,Great film--Awful release,"My roommate and I both jumped at the chance to buy this new release of Fantastic Planet, what with the 1999 edition being out of print, and thus, more expensive.But now I'm returning it and spending the extra twenty for the '99 version.Neither of the discs play on our dvd player--a Magnavox, purchased new in 2005. These are the first (and only) dvds that we've been unable to play. The main menu pops up, but whenever we try to advance beyond that point, the screen freezes, or blanks.Sure, our dvd player isn't super new, but we've never encountered a problem with a disc until now. We are certain the problem isn't just a faulty disc, either, because we each purchased Fantastic Planet, received them at different times, and both act exactly the same way when put in the television--teasing with the menu.This was a waste of our money. So, just be careful."
1,Brand new & Broken?,"So I bought this movie for a close friend for Christmas. It's one of his favorite movies, so I was excited to give it to him & watch it. So he gets it, we put it in the DVD player and it says ""Disc read error"", so I was like maybe it's this DVD player. We put a different DVD in and it started up with absolutely no problems. So I'm very disappointed that this brand new product I just purchased is broken. This is one of my first real disappointments from Amazon."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Like some of the others here, I ordered this classic with great anticipation. I remembered it from years ago. Truly an artistic masterpiece. However, when I received the DVD it would not play in any of my three DVD players. You can read the other reviews, but beware, it most likely will NOT play in your player! Don't waste your money!"
4,Or is it Savage Planet?,"Superior, poetic, high-concept, French animated sci-fi about a distant world inhabited by super smart (and really big), fishy-looking aliens who keep humans as pets - that is when they're not hunting, maiming, and poisoning them like gophers. One day a tiny human gets hold of an alien learning ""ring"" and becomes super smart himself, quickly passing on his newfound IQ to his fellow dinkys. War ensues a la Gulliver, and the secret dream life of the aliens becomes their undoing. Much carnage, philosophy, and brutality, especially for a pastel-drawn feature. Originally played in theatres on a double bill with ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" under the more appropriate title which translates to ""Savage Planet."""
2,"Extremely good movie, but this edition suffers.","Imagine how I felt finally being able to buy this on video, only to find out that this particular version is dubbed into English (as in the original USA release) and subtitled into English. The subtitles do not match the dubbing. I'd really like to see it in the orignal French..."
4,A beautiful and fascinating obscure little movie.,"I actually caught this on some movie channel, in a motel, at about 3 in the morning. This is one of those movies that you never have heard about, but really rewards a person for having an open mind about what movie to watch. Rene Laloux presents a surreal atmosphere throughout. It also has a deep plot; unlike U.S. animated movies, this was made for adults, and therefore it speaks on a very mature level. Though, what makes this movie worth it is its sublime enviroments and beautiful artwork."
2,This looks like a bootleg copy.,"The transfer on this DVD is very bad and reminds me of a bootleg copy and not something from a production house. When I saw this movie back around 1985 I saw it dubbed in ENGLISH. I am a typical American and hate sub-titles so where is the dubbed version at now? With DVD's multi-lingual capabilities you would have thought they would have added the dubbed version on the english track but they did not. I still like the movie but as far as this DVD goes save your money and wait for it to reappear at another time, and hopefully done right this time."
3,"Great Animation, Bad Production","I loved this Animation when I saw it Years ago in College. Since I have a Multi Region DVD player, buying this DVD was not a problem. However, The English Subtitles are a major Disappointment! You cannot turn them off and they Subtract from the overall quality of this Great Animation."
1,Beware- DVD will not play on most US machines,"A warning to all potential buyers of this edition of ""Fantastic Planet"". I received two copies of this edition, and neither would play properly on my DVD player, nor two players I tried at my friends' houses. The movie would play, but would freeze and jump every few seconds. The extras would not play at all. And again, this happened with two separate discs and on multiple players.Unless you're content to play this on a computer, do NOT buy this disc, as you will most likely have problems. Shame on Amazon will selling what is, in effect, a defective DVD. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,"5 stars for the film ONLY, not the DVD","I saw this movie on cable in the mid-90s and thought it was PHENOMINAL! Yes, the animation was far inferior to mid-90s techniques, but I really enjoyed the retro feel. The film had a dream-like, surreal quality that I have never experienced with a film before. The story was great and the music was fantastic. So, why am I not buying this DVD?I am holding out, with great faith, that it will be given a proper DVD treatment in the future. Anamorphic widescreen, if not 5.1, at least a decent stereo track, and the option to eliminate the subtitles.The current version can be found easily, but it is expensive. I refuse to pay that much money for a product that I will ultimately be unsatisifed with. If and when a proper DVD release comes to pass, I will happily pay good money for such a unique and enjoyable film."
2,"Great film, Bad DVD","This is a very good, animated film that I saw in 1973 with NO subtitles and in English... A few years ago it was very disappointing to buy the VHS tape in the English language AND English subtitles (that doesn't match the dialog). The subtitles may be a literal translation of the French language and while interesting to see the difference, once, it's rather tiresome to have the subtitles there, not to mention distracting. It's difficult to rate this DVD because it's a great movie, but the subtitles only version sucks. And I haven't actually bought the DVD because in reading earlier Amazon.com customer reviews it seems the producers are pushing that same cheesed-out VHS tape version, with extra features of course. Why would I buy the same old VHS rendition? I will not buy this DVD version. If an uncensored version is released with the ability to switched off the subtitles, and in the original English language that I'd seen before, then I'll buy it!..."
2,"Not a good DVD, but a must own film!","The DVD itself is not the greatest quality. This DVD's biggest upset is that it has subtitles which cannot be turned off. They will probably never release a special edition version of this DVD, so you are stuck with this version. With all that said though......this is still a must see/must own for all true sci-fi fans. This is one of the true strange/weird/brain-melt sci-fi films. If you enjoyed David Lynch's version of Dune, the anime Galaxy Express 999, TRON, or A.I. you will probably enjoy this film."
4,Wonderful French Hallucination,"Fans of animation , science fiction, or just plain weirdness must not pass this up. Contains some of the most mind-bendingly surreal creatures and backdrops to ever make there way into a feature-length animated film from any country. My only problem with this DVD is the language options. French audio with English subs is fine, but English audio with English subtitles - what is the sense in that? I found it very annoying and unecessary."
1,It Really Doesn't Play,"I read the reviews and thought: ""these complainers must just have really old DVD players, or something."" Nope. This DVD doesn't play in my system either. It is a pity - this is a wonderful movie and it would have been nice to get a digital copy. It is hard to believe that anybody could burn a DVD this bad. I got as far as the main menu - it turns out that every time you hit the ""menu"" button on your DVD player, you have to re-watch the FBI warning. Amazing."
1,I WAS RIPPED OFF BY AMAZON !,"I remembered this movie from the 70's and was very excited to see Fantastic Planet. It was beautifully animated and a compelling, thought provoking story. My first copy didn't play (I played it after the 30 day warrenty period), so I ordered another one. That wouldn't play either. I sent both of them back immediatly and have not gotten any of my money back. I have bought a large amount of used items from Amazon with pretty good luck. Buying from their inventory was a mistake.........."
1,Stinker Revenge,"I chose this movie without realizing what it was. I did not notice the year it was made. All I noticed was the title and a picture of Godon Scott. It led me to assume the movie would star Gordon Scott. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. The picture was very fuzzy and the acting was terrible. I could only watch about ten minutes of the film before turning it off. I was extremely disappointed, with an emphasis on ""dis""."
5,Two thumbs up to A2ZCDS for a riotous jungle adventure with all the mandatory predatory trimmings.,"""Actually, I'm a diehard Johnny Weissmueller fan myself, but Glenn Morris is outstanding as Tarzan in `Tarzan's Revenge'. He does for the Jungle Lord what Roger Moore did for James Bond - he outdoes his predecessor. Two thumbs up to A2ZCDS for a riotous jungle adventure with all the mandatory predatory trimmings."""
1,Easy to see why the series was canceled,"I missed this when it aired on TV, but after watching this, I found out that missing it the first time actually saved me from wasting a few hours of my life.The acting was eh, but the personalities given to the cars ruined the show. The original Knight Rider was cheesy by today's standards, but is still better than this show."
4,Anonymous,"This book is one of the best books I've read as manual for anyone interested in trading options. The book provides insight by using straightforward language combined with creative illustrations. I found this guide to be an inviting, yet comprehensive look into the world of options. Also, it explains what options are and how they work, provides real-world investing scenarios and describes strategies for various market conditions."
2,flexible? not even close,i bought this hose because of one thing - it was touted as very flexible even in cold temps. i would call that a LIE - even when warmed up (my house is about 70) still very hard to coil.
1,leaks,"Well I waited to use this hose til the summer, and shame on me as the return window closed April 4th the brass fitting, where the threaded end of the hose attaches to the rubber sprays water like a fountain, poorly made, poorly fitted piece of expensive JUNK!!! Shame on you Amazon- re-thinking my Prime membership over this one,I bought two, both leak and it's a pressure fitting so there is no repair POS!!!!!!"
1,Do not buy this hose!,"It is not stated anywhere that I could find on the Amazon prduct page, however once I received the hose I found the following Warning on the back of the product packaging:""!WARNING"" This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.Who would think they would have to wash their hands after watering the garden. What if one of the kids sneaks a drink from the hose? The manufacturer does not say what chemicals are used, nor give the consumer the information to make an informed decision. Based upon the prop65 warning and additional hand washing warning I will not use this product as the risk is unknown.In the end I returned the hose, but am really ticked off that a Made In America product is such junk, I found in my local hardware store several different brand hoses without this warning."
5,Excellent Hose,"This Flexogen hose is really nicely built. This heavy-duty hose has solid brass fixtures on both ends,and it is flexible. There's nothing that I can say bad about this product. I've had several of these Flexogen hoses in the past, and they seem to hold up well. JC"
5,Finally! College coaching the way it was meant to be!,"Gary Barnett is one of those guys you'd like to have a beer with....A master of motivation and getting young people to believe in themselves (even when the facts say they shouldn't!) Barnett works from everyday experiences and personal convictions to extract the absolute best from his players. The result is not only the greatest turn around of an entire collegiate program in history, but the ""release"" of some truly gifted student athletes into the world. I virtually read this book in one sitting -- I simply could not put it down. Someday, I going to have to find a way to buy Barnett that beer, just to get the advance copy of his sequel. By the way, Gary, just exactly was that ""horrid"" event in college, for which you got into so much trouble? The intrigue is killing me"
3,Great Book!,"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro creates and explores the gothic story behind the three mysterious brides within Dracula's castle. How he found, seduced, and made them. These three characters sporadically appear in the original Dracula. This is the story of Kelene meaning ""black star"". Really amazing writing blended with illustrations."
5,Passionate and complete look,"This surprisingly interesting look at Outdoor Public Sculpture in Indiana has informed and entertained us immensely. 300 pages, 200 photos, slick. Pleasantly pleased with the fanciful portion; we are on our way to see the 18 foot Santa as well as the poignant stonecarver Louis Baker monument in Bedford, just as if he were still carving. And taking the book with us as we discover these facinating public rememberances. Finally, a helpful, well done and informative book !"
4,my review,Gloria Miklowitz writes about a senior in high school his name is Cam potter. Cam has recieved a state scholor ship for football. Cams coach suggest a guy at a gym but there is a catch Cam has to gain 30 puonds to get the scholar ship. when Cam gets to the gym the trainer asks cam to use steroid. Cam knows that he shouldnt but he takes them any way. this book is about a senior experamenting with steroids and in the end gets caught.
4,Eddie - You Were My Childhood,"I loved Eddie Fisher from the time I was about 10 years old. I loved his voice. I have several LP's and, thankfully, have been able to replace them with CD's. This collection has several songs I didn't have especially the Christmas section. Everyone is Eddie Fisher at his best. I don't think he ever got the credit he deserved. Listening to him brings back memories of ""Coke Time"" and his TV show with George Gobel.It's unfortunate that his personal life over-shadowed his talent. I'll always miss him."
4,Being Vane,"This is a nice, sturdy, economical sprinkler. The droplets fall like a soft rain and have a wide reach for such a small tool. I like that this sprinkler is metal and is heavy enough to stay put after one positions it on the ground.The only problem is that if you leave it on unattended for too long a period puddling and over saturation will occur. This is inevitable with a stationary sprinkler as opposed to one that oscillates."
2,Water Distribution Is Uneven,"I wanted to use two of these sprinklers to water some freshly tilled, raked, and grass-seeded ground. The water started pooling on the ground within five feet of the sprinkler while the rest of the coverage area was barely damp. I returned them. I subsequently got much more even coverage with oscillating and pulsating sprinklers."
4,This thing gets my lawn wet,"Yeah so this product really makes my lawn wet! It spins around and shoots water everywhere, which is nice. The more you crank up the water, the more of your lawn gets wet. 4 stars for doing what it's supposed to very well. I think a 5 star sprinker would like test the moisture of the soil and turn itself on and off in order to provide the optimum balance for its yard."
4,Great for small areas,This is a great sprinkler that really soaks an area uniformly even if only 35x35 feet.
5,Just what I wanted.,"Thanks, for having this doll to add to my daughter and granddaughter collection. The plastic was a little yellow, but the dolls is looking great. Now, I just need to add a few more dolls to their collection."
5,john farnham: the last time,"john farnham new cd the last time what came out on the 30 September 2002 by Gotham/BMG what has gone platinum in australia the cd has 10 songs on it. song like the last time what mick jagger and keith richards write. also has sametimes, keep talking and lot more good song on it. it is a great cd. john farnham is Australia's greatest singer today. and any thing john farnham put out will all ways be great to list to. if you are a john farnham fan this a great cd to get. if you are not get out there and listen to his new cd you will love his music and you will buy it."
2,Terrible writing,"This book was free (for the Kindle), and that's part of the reason I read it. The genre of alternative history has always been something that sounded interesting to me, but I'd never read any.Well, the writing is absolutely terrible: Cliches abound; literary crutches that didn't work a first time reused several times, sometimes within a few pages; terrible representation of Southern dialect; lots of things that just annoy the heck out of me.If I had realized this book was 640 pages long, I would have given up on it early. But, I'll give Turtledove this, I cared about a few of the characters and finished it up because I wanted to know what the heck happens. Unfortunately, it's part of a trilogy so I only got a small payoff at the end -- one I saw coming, at that. I won't be picking up the rest of the trilogy."
3,Not Enough New Developments and Too Much Repetition,"After a great deal of anticipation for the first installment in the Settling Accounts series, I must say I found reading the work more like a chore than experiencing the joy I have reading prequels to this novel. It seems as if the characters have all become static. Anyone reading this novel has surely read the Great War and American Empire series and knows all about the characters. The useless reminiscing by nearly every individual and the constant reminders of what happened to characters thirty pages previously made the work tedious. I hope _Drive to the East_ gets back to the basics of Turtledove's writings: keep the story moving, throw in some real people here and there, take events that happened in France and Germany and set them on the Mason-Dixon line, and introduce some new characters. On a positive note, Patton vs. MacArthur intrigues me to no end."
5,A great book about great men.,"Back to Corregidor is Gerard Devlin's third and last (2004) book.It is an account of one of the well known actions of the 503 PRCT commanded by Col. George Jones.It is thoroughly investigated by Mr. Devlin, who served in the 503rd Airborne Infantry in the fifties, and the story is clear and simple. When i started reading the book i could not stop. For the eager reader there are more books to find which covers the same subject. (Flanagan is one of them). If you are a paratrooper buff, please buy Devlin's book ""Paratrooper"". This is one of the best books written about the subject.A good book to have in your collection of the paratroopers of World War II."
4,Good hose sprayer.,"I often spray ornamental trees with a mixture of chemicals, so the new single-chemical, ""dial a concentration"" sprayers don't suit. Deflector is removable to permit spraying to the tops of trees (20""). Only bad design feature is the lack of control of the type of spray as was a feature on older hose sprayers that are no longer available in our area."
2,Will it ever lead somewhere?,"I literally love everything she writes and was floored when I couldn't finish this book. It just never took off, it dragged. There are too many books waiting to be read to have to ""work to get thru"", maybe sometime I'll try to finish, but not anytime soon."
5,Excellent Read!,"I was impressed by this book in that it was written SO long ago yet the points made are so clearly relevant to any age. Plain-spoken and punctuated with clear facts to justify his opinions. I'm not a Unitarian, but this is a great book to learn more about that faith."
3,Just checking...,I took a quiz that said that the closest religion to what I believe would be Unitarian. I figured I would take a look. On further review... I think not. It was a pretty boring read but I had to check and see if it fit.
3,Too Basic and Outdated,While I'm sure this book was great when it came out over 5-years ago. Now the book is very out of date and not very usefull. David Drucker should pull this book from the shelfs and give it a major update.
3,ITS PRETTY 'GOOD',"Well, I picked up this album just because I took a chance on it, never heard of them before... its decent overall, the best track by far is Awaken. Who to compare them to, uh, hmm, well its got some melodic guitars, one fluid deep growling throughout with an occasional scream. I mean its not original sounding, its like 'good' but there are so many other 'good' bands that sound 'good' but this isn't 'great', its just 'good'... saw these guys live at new england metal hardcore fest, pretty 'good'."
3,unoriginal,"This band steals riffs.. seriously.. they steal AT THE GATES riffs. you want to listen to At the Gates riffs buy terminal spirit disease, if you want to listen to someone ripping off at the gates guitar riffs buy beyond the sixth seal.. this band angers me... a lot"
1,Seriously?!,"I bought this CD for my outer space-loving preschooler. I thought the music would be a bit new age-y and ambient and interesting to listen to as he fell asleep at night. What it sounds like is an 8-year-old toiling away at an old school Casio keyboard in their semi-finished basement. When I purchased this several years ago, there were no music samples. I see that there are now. Do yourself a favor and listen to them before you click the purchase button."
2,Not Made in the USA,I am not happy that this is not made in the USA. The reason I purchased this was the description said that it is made in the USA. I will be contacting Amazon and Gilmour about this. This is false advertising. I suppose I should have read the reviews first and would have found this out. I have not used this so I cannot comment on the ability of this nozzel to function. I plan on sending this back.
4,Very Helpful,I was pleasantly surprised by this cookbook. The recipes are very easy to use and to shop for. The food taste very good. I had more energy and overall felt better. This cookbook is very helpful to me as a person with hypoglycemia.
3,a REAL disappointment in the bread recipe category,"After waiting for this book to finally come out I was disappointed not to find BREAD recipes!!! (There is, however, one roll recipe) One recipe instructed me on how to toast a bought bagel and spread it with cream cheese - a BIT more elementary than I expected. I still LOVE the diet though!!"
3,It's OK,"The recipes are quick & easy and tasty too, but I'm disappointed that there is no nutritional information for the recipes. I need to keep my carb count much lower than the Sugar Busters recommend so I need the nutritional info. calculated for me (because I hate to do it myself). This is a good cookbook to have, no doubt, but I also recommend ""Lauri's Low-Carb Cookbook"" by Lauri Ann Randolph. She provides nutritional info on all her recipes. Your best bet is to get both cookbooks."
2,Eh...,"As a musical theatre connoisseur, this just doesn't cut it for me. There's not nearly enough songs to even really qualify as a musical, just a bunch of underscored dialogue. It's funny to listen to but not worth repeated listenings. Sherie Rene Scott is amazing though, as usual."
4,Socio-political outrage,"Brutal socio-political hardcore from White Trash Rob of Boston's infamous Blood for Blood. Lind pulls no punches as he honestly and strightforwardly examines current events from a truly refreshing objective point of view. Not for those who let blind patriotism dictate their train of thought, this EP honestly points the finger at guilty parties, some within the US itself, for the current state of the world's demise. If you like your hardcore straightforward, to the point, and full of fearless honesty, check out Ramallah. Be sure to read up on the Ramallah settlement too, and you'll have a better idea of where Lind is coming from."
1,faulty tension bands,within six usage of the cross crunch all of the tension bands snapped . was inable to purchase or have bands replaced after less then 2 weeks of use. was also refused a cross crunch replacement
3,"Good ""in between book""","a few too many twist/turns/and unrealistic happenings. But, for a book that gives you a bit of entertainment in between best sellers, this one was ok."
3,Death at the La Fenice; A commissario Brunetti Mystery,Location of mystery and the problems with working in the Italian policedepartment I found interesting. Enjoyed the indepth developement of the characters.
4,Enjoyed every minute,"What a fun book! This was my first Donna Leon book, and I'll definitely be reading more. Brunetti is such a likable character, though even the less likable ones have their endearing quirks. Leon has a nice style, and I found myself laughing out loud more than once at some of the humorous interactions and observations she depicts. I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because I thought the resolution of the book didn't quite work as well as the rest of the book. (I don't want to say too much! You'll have to read it.)"
3,Meh,It was ok. Not full of suspense. It was more of an intellectual mystery. Liked the main character (Brunetti) and the conversations with his wife as well as the descriptions of Venice and such. The endless interviews and discussions were a little tedious and generally the book was just a little slow for me. I don't think that's the fault of the writer of the book though.
3,"Compelling characters, great setting, wandering narrative","This writer dropped me into Venice before I knew I was there, and I immediately found the appeal in the peripatetic devotee of good living, Guido Brunetti. He's the right combination between practical as we all are, and romantic, which makes him an excellent hero for more contemplative mysteries. Of course, who doesn't like to read about the beauties of Venice? Add these two together and you have a potent setting; on top of this, Leon's writing is fluid and reads easily, although it's about the furthest thing from ""suspense"" I can imagine. The mystery was a bit drab, and the book fell into a classic case of wandering after the midpoint. Still, I didn't regret the time spent reading this, and would recommend it to anyone who likes coffee table mysteries."
3,red herrings,I found the plot tedious. There were far too many suspects which the evidence did not support. The ending was trite - a contrived happy ending. The comment by Patta that 'no woman who is a mother could have done something ...' is so ludicrious that only a naive child could make it. However Venice was so clearly delineated it was like being guided round the heartland. I wish I could go back and see it through Brunetti's eyes.The book is a must for anyone intending to visit venice and despite its faults is a good read.
3,A classic mystery from Venice,"I would give the book a C+. It was entertaining enough to read from start to finish but I was left waiting for the book to really grip me and pull me in like other mystery books. The writing is fluid and reads easily, but it is more of a novel than ""suspense"" mystery. The story was a bit slow and drab at times. I didn't regret the time spent reading this, and would probably recommend it to anyone."
3,Va Bene,"Commissario Guido Brunetti of the Venice Questura makes his first appearance in this series set in the tourist mecca. This book is more about the Venetian mindset and way of life than the murder of a famous opera conductor. This wasn't a great mystery, but I enjoyed (most of) it. I have some quibbles with the character development and the reader must be as patient with the slow pacing as the Italians are with bureaucracy."
4,Her first book was well written and entertaining,"This was the first one of her books that I read. Enjoyed the realistic depiction of police procedures and the character development. As I read the second and third books books, however, they became increasingly bleak and pessimistic. Probably won't read any more."
5,Death at. La Venice,As usual Leon is the greatest fiction writer in europe. The moral observations are excellent. Recommend all of her books.
4,When will Caterella burst into Brunetti's office?,"If you enjoy the Guido Brunetti novels by Donna Leon then by all means you really need to also read Andrea Camilleri's ""Inspector Montalbano"" series of books. I am struck by the similarities and half expected Catarella to barge into Guido Brunetti's office. Camilleri's books were translated into English by Stephen Sartarelli and provide abundant footnotes explaining Italian culture.I would highly recommend both series."
4,Takes you to Italla,I just got back from Venice and it's the most beautiful city in the world. This easy read takes you right back.
3,"Nice athmosphere, but no thrill","A fameous conducter, Mr Wellauer, dies during one of his presentations in La fenice"", the opera of Venice. Vice comissario Brunetti gets this case, and finds out that it was cyanide, that killed Wellauer. So Brunetti has to interview the people who knew him, but there are a lot of suspects.I think that DEATH AT LA FENICE is a quite boring book. Why ? During the hole book, there's only the view of Guido Brunetti. The result is that you see only the very slow progress in the case. And there's no action too. Altough I think that Donna Leon created a very nice athmosphere (e.g. when Brunetti is walking around Venice) and shows a realistic picture of the man Brunetti, DEATH AT LA FENICE is a thriller with no thrill.Peace to the world, Ricardo Double P"" Angeli"
1,A BIG BORING QUESTIONING,"I think, Donna Leon is a very good writer. What I mean is, that she's got a very good writing style, but unfortunately she is a very very bad screenplay-writer. What I want to say is that in this book, there is just too much times the same plot, there are not enough exciting parts which would bring a real progress in the case. It's just always the same story, about twenty times in the book, Brunetti goes to someone and talks with him, but he doesn't find out anything intresting that would bring a bit of excitement in this boring questionings. The end is really good and logical, but I think that this good part only contains about 30-40 pages, and that's not enough to make a crimestory worth to be read. I think, perhaps I should read another book written by Donna Leon, to get used to her style and to Guido, who is very sympathic to me, but I don't know if I'll have the power to manage this incredible boreness during 95% of a book once again...."
4,fun book especially if you know Venice!,"I really enjoyed the book and have read several of these in the past. Since Venice is one of my favorite places in the world, and having been to the opera house, it was especially fun. and easy to follow on the map with all the street names and boat stops."
4,Impressed.,"As a first mystery by Ms.Leon. I was impressed by the deft plot and smooth flow of her writing style. I was hooked by Venice when I visited there in person, and was not dissapointed by the authors' efforts at fleshing out the city for us. I also felt comfortble with the Brunetti family since they resemble some people I have actually known, which makes the tale so believable. Isn't that what any good author attempts to do? Kudos to Donna Leon on this one."
5,Death At La Fenice,"Knowing how really good an author Donna Leon is, I wanted to share one of her books with a friend. So I started off with her first one,""Death At La Fenice.""The book from Amazon came in perfect condition for use as a gift, and I knew that when it was read the reader would want to read other mysteries solved with the help of Commissario Guido Brunetti of Venice, Leon's main character.Leon has a way of taking you back down the streets, canals, and into the squares of Venice through Guido Brunetti, making you feel like you are actually there.This book is rich in Italian culture, filled with mystery, and has a surprised ending that leaves the reader wanting more Leon mysteries."
2,Death at La Fenice,I found this book very disappointing. I had certain expectations as I am from a town near Venice.This is not a book for anybody that has been to Venice and I cannot think of anybody I would recommend it to. For me it was a waste of money.
4,Death at La Fenice,Captures the mystery of Venice and develops memorable characters in an absorbing style. A layer of analysis of Italian life and politics of the country.
4,Revealing,Very complete book on the subject. Explanations and pictures are veryrevealing.Excellent reading.
5,a guide to coming clean,This book explains EVERYTHING you would want to know about this all too common of illnesses. This book is a true guide with a whole lot of insider information. If you have a prostate or love any one with one this is the book to buy.
4,"A worthwhile ""first opinion""","The book is very thorough, and does have a noticeable bias toward surgery. BUT it does an excellent job with that viewpoint, and surgery is indeed the ""gold standard"" for cure in many cases. That being said, I'd suggest buying this one but also reading ""A Primer on Prostate Cancer"" by Stephen Strum and Donna Pogliano, which is the best overall PC resource book I've seen, and better balanced."
3,A hard sell for surgery,"If it wasn't for the obligatory overview of the prostate and arather clear description of what prostate cancer is, I would have used fewer stars due to the overbearing presence of Walsh'sego. Its reads like Walsh's ""brand"" of treatment and while hetries to say a few comforting words, I found his viewpoint depressing and thus, less helpful than it could be. A much more honest and comforting recent read is A Hit Below the Belt by a Dr with prostate cancer."
5,Definative Book on Prostate Cancer,"This is a thorough and helpful reference on Prostate Cancer. It was recommended to us by my husbands urologist after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year. It provides through descriptions of the disease and treatment options and recovery process. It was helpful in the making a decision on the type of treatment we would use. We used it as a reference source through out the process of treatment and recovery. Since then we have recomended it to other men facing this diagnosis, and they have found it helpful as well."
3,Sizing problems,"Nice product, looks good, fast delivery but sized way off..order at least 2 to 3 sizes larger than you need..I ordered 2 sizes up and it is still so snug I may return.."
1,Stay clear if you have Win7,This is NOT compatible with Windows 7. I had to reinstall my operating system after mistakenly trying. Major disaster. Beware so you do not make the same mistake.
2,Used to be good,"I had bought this sprayer in the past but now they are made very cheaply and if dropped, the sprayer selection part separates from the body of the sprayer leaking water all over. Not what they used to be."
2,Did not stand up to heat,"I bought this last fall, and it had been working fine. But today (it's summer in the Phoenix metro area), when I went to use it, the thing had warped and it leaked and whistled. Obviously, most of us keep our nozzles attached to the hose, and of course the hose is stored outside. This all-plastic device could not stand up to the heat."
1,"Leak, leak, and leak","I bought two. One leaked as received. Got a replacement. Then, the second one leaked. Gave up. Leak comes from o ring too skinny and plastic not strong enough. Slightly higher water pressure caused the leak. Need to shut off the water after iuse. Very inconvenient."
1,Absolute junk!,"After only 4 months -- using it perhaps twice a week, at most -- something inside must have burst, and water is spraying all over. I've had the Orbit version, only a few dollars more, for a full year, with much more usage weekly, and it's in okay shape. I would steer clear of the Gilmour products based on my experience."
1,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, BUT BARRON'S. THIS IS MISSING IMPORTANT INFO!","I bought this book to study for the CSET, opting for it instead of Barron's or other prep guides. I only took sections 1 and 3; passed section 1 and missed section 3 by two points. The reason I hold this book accountable is that it makes no mention whatsoever, in its section 3 study guide, about reading sheet music. However, on the exam I took there were several multiple choice questions and one short-answer response that relied on reading music. Without any idea this would be on the test, I was a bit dumbfounded, having no previous knowledge of reading music. Had this been covered, and given the tiny margin by which I did not pass the test, I regret using this book, and will opt for Barron's in the future, who, I later checked, does cover reading sheet music. Do yourself a favor, and go with Barron's as well."
3,"OK, I guess -- but watch out for those typos.","The most useful portions of this book are the test questions and answer explanations -- I've browsed through all and have benefited from reviewing them. Please note that there are MANY typos in the practice tests -- some answers they give are just plain wrong. It's not you -- it's the book! The review sections are of mixed quality -- overall, they're helpful but as other reviewers in this area noticed it's hard to cram overviews of so much info in one book. This book is recommended but I intend to also purchase another (probably Barron's) to review prior to sitting for the test in three weeks."
3,I still didn't pass the test,"I took all 4 CSETs for English, passed the multiple choice ones with no problems...high scores, but the two written exams were totally different from what this book offers. I failed, and miserably."
2,It is ok...,"I bought this item due to it's price but it was a but inadequate. I recommend ""cliff notes"" to pass this test"
1,"Horrible guide, don't waste your time","As someone who recently took the CSET, the only study guide I recommend is Cliff's 2nd Edition. REA's was a total waste of time."
2,Crisp Apple Clif Shot,"Pretty good tasting with cold water, but as you let it sit a while and it warms to room temperature it doesn't taste too good. Maybe the other flavors are better."
3,acidic but taste is OK,"This stuff tastes okay but is way too acidic. Now that I've been cycling more, I've turned to other products that don't destroy my teeth as much."
3,Decent organic hydration,"I am enjoying the Clif Shot Crisp Apple on my weekend 20 mile + bike rides. The flavor is ok, if slightly metallic, i appreciate the fact its organic. The price is excellent."

5,"I'm a cat convert, too. Morris says it well and all .","I've always loved Willie Morris and now I love kitties, too. This book touched my heart and is going to touch the hearts of all my friends for Christmas."
3,"For Non-Cat Owners, Mostly","If you've owned or lived with a cat, this book won't do much for you, unless you are already a fan of Morris's work. It's your basic story of the unwilling/reluctant character learning to love a creature he never thought he'd ever come to love.As a cat owner, none of Morris's observations came as a revelation to me. I'm not saying that every cat memoir book needs to include some breakthrough snippets of information. I just wish I was more emotionally engaged with his experiences with his cat, and I simply wasn't."
5,A Captivating Cat,"This wonderful story about the author and his love for his cat struck a sad note in me when I read at the end of the book that he passed away last year. I felt so sad for Spit, who I felt like I'd gotten to know so well through the book's journey. A few times I felt like reading this book aloud to our little cat while she sat curled up beside me."
4,Delightful,Can a life-long dog person learn to like cats? Yes he can. The author marries a cat lady and discovers the joys of being owned by a feline. Spit McGee was the runt of a litter. The author saved his life and the two became long-time companions. This book is an easy read for a lazy afternoon.
3,OK story but irresponsible pet owner,"I really love books about animals, especially cats so I bought this book for my kindle. The author spends a lot of time talking about dogs and what seemed like a lesser amount of time talking about the cats which I found a little strange.It was an ok book but it really bothered me that the author on several occasions discussed how they let their female cats breed without any mention that perhaps in hindsight it would have been better to spay them due to the huge pet overpopulation problem in the world. It also bothered me that they seemed to just let their cats roam free even after Spit was run over by a motorcycle and another of their cats disappeared.I can't highly recommend this book because it just didn't grab my attention but I liked it well enough to finish it."
2,Weak Cat Story,"This book is a little too well written possibly to cover up the fact that Mr. Morris is definitely not a true ailurophile. He should stick to dog stories. I chose not to finish the last 20 or so pages out of principle. If he was a true cat lover he would have kept his precious animals inside and out of danger, and would have gotten them all neutered!"
5,What many people don't understand...,"I have read several reviews here reviling Mr. Morris for not keeping his cat inside. This, I think is a geographical culture difference. While there's no doubt cats are safer and live longer in most cases inside a house, the fact is that in many Southern rural and suburban areas, cats do live outside. And, believe it or not, live wonderful lives! An outside cat can climb trees, hunt birds, and find a sunny spot to lie in all day long.Before you send the hate mail, let me say that I actually have an inside cat, because in my area I do believe it is safer for him to be inside. But I know plenty of people who let their cats roam around in the country, and believe me, it is a great life. It would be great if people could stop making moral judgements and enjoy the book for what it is, a funny and touching memoir about a man's second chance at love and all the changes that come with it."
2,Couldn't get interested in the book,"Usually like Mr Farris' work, but this one despite being thought-provoking and interesting in places just seem to be a bit too slow and overall a little dark. Thee two star rating is likely unfair, but I just couln't get into the book and ended-up recycling it only partially read."
1,Stopped shutting off water after two months,"This valve is junk. The entire valve and more importantly the latch that closes the valve is entirely made of plastic. After just two months the valve fails to close because the latch developed a crack and won't apply enough force to turn the valve all the way. You get what you pay for, save your money and buy a Dramm valve... it's 3x the price but will last 100x longer."
3,I wanted more personal remembrances,"This is a beautiful book with good recipes (although a warning: measurements are English style, not American); but I found myself wishing for more personal remembrances of the princess and her family. Obviously, Burrell is respecting the memory of Diana, and that's good, but couldn't he have found a happy medium?"
2,Call me snobby.........we are always curious about Royalty,"I'm sure the Royal Family would not apporve of Paul Burrell's ""cashing in"" on his relationship with Princess Diana. Having said that, people in the USA love this kind of thing. We can hold our noses in the air if we read this book, we feel priviliged. We are special. Burrell, however, may be a nicer version of Martha Stewart. She wins the prize for cold psycho-perfection. Paul Burrell, like Martha, has now gone on to merchandize furniture, wine, rugs, and just about anything else in this world. I am waiting for him to open a ""royal theme park"" in Florida. I must add a post-script to this review as I just recently purchased a copy of this book from E-bay that was signed by Paul Burrell. I too am now guilty of joining the curiosity seekers who want to have an inside look at the so-called ""royal life"". So hit me with a large blancmange and call me snobby."
5,Very good slingshot,"Very happy with this product, it is exactly as I imagined it would be. I had heard of others having trouble with the sling and the bands but I did not have this problem at all. It is high quality and very solidly built and seems like it will last a long time. My friends and I have used it quite a bit already and it has stood up to the punishment very well. With some steel shot it is surprisingly accurate and a lot of fun to plink around with! I would definitely recommend this slingshot; at $15 it was worth every penny."
3,Barnett Diablo Purchase,"I purchased the Barnett Diablo Slingshot,The first thing i notice is the color was different then pictured,In picture and on package it looks neon green(lemon lime)when arrived it grass green.This is not good if someone puts it down in the grass,It may get lost or mowed over.I call company about this they replyed that the way it looks when the picture was taken ,Well i think not.The band on this it a bit longer which is ok if you have longer arms and it has a larger leather section that hold pellet which is nice.This Slingshot is made good and aim is good.Time will tell how long band will last."
2,Strap broke after less then 75 shots,Got this to ward of varmits but my life was in danger after less then 75 shots when the tubing and the leather pouch broke.Thank God I was quick on my feet when I had to make it back to my casa with furry critters on my tail.Not a good product.
3,Be careful,Thsi slingshot will propell a object a gooly distance with accuracy. I use it in ceilings to carry twine thus the need to lift many tiles. Finding the string is anther issue for it goes farther than expected. Good control with wrist brace.
2,poor material choice,"the pouch broke after about 250 shots, which is a little dissapointing because i was going to reinforce it later."
4,"Well designed, not always accurate","I like the grip handle, use the product to keep hawks and bears away from my koi pond. Shooting the lighter pellets isn't accurate, but is quite accurate with heavier ones. I find I have to set the grip base on a flat surface to shoot accurately, though."
5,Great Instructors,We enjoyed this one as much as the Ultimate Two-Step Video. Great tips and beautiful dancing techniques. Wouldn't use this that much in Texas; we normally just plow our way through everyone! But it would have come in handy when we visited Nashville and everyone was doing line dances we hadn't learned yet! They go through step and arm movements very thoroughly and make it easy to learn!
5,Great way to learn,"I've looked at a number of tapes and DVDs lately, including three that this same couple have made. This tape (and others in the set) are far and away the best in terms of showing the steps (men first, then women, then together) and providing important details that others leave out entirely (how to hold your hands to make a turn). The jokes are corny but I think they present a good picture of some very personable dancers. I'm a beginning dancer (although I'm over 50) and this tape has allowed me and a partner to learn enough steps to be able to dance together at a nightclub. We'll be even better with more practice. I haven't seen a tape or DVD which does a better job. I wish they had a version for Rumba."
4,"Good for the intermediate, but you'll still need a first lesson","Though we learned many steps from this video, we think an initial lesson on the step-slide is required for the raw beginner. A little less he-hawing around and an additional step would make this video more valuable to the purchaser. We hope the same couple will do a follow-up DVD."
5,Strong and long-lastimg,"This product has withstood the test of high traffic, unfavorable conditions, and several months of use with no wear.I used this product by directly anchoring it to a concrete walkway (where it is exposed to the elements in Florida including heat, flooding downpours, and even some corrosive salty air), in order to stop a screen door leading to my front porch from banging into landscaping pavers. The door leads directly to the house, and it has probably hit the doorstop literally thousands of times.I went outside to take a peak at it again while typing this. It looks exactly the same as the day I drilled the hole into the walkway. What more can I ask for?"
5,Does what it's suppose to do!,This is great to keep flys from landing and crawling up your beer faucet. Also keeps the faucet tip from getting sticky. Works great and easy to clean.
3,"Fits well, won't work with Faucet Lock","These work well and keep the tap nozzle fresh.They're too big if you're trying to use a tap faucet lock though. The lock won't fit over them.If that's helpful to ONE customer out of a thousand, I'll be happy. :-)"
5,"Simple but works mint, a must for kegerators!","My faucet used to stick and get smelly or moldy but not after the Tap Soother! Keeps bugs, mold, dust, etc out and keeps your faucet slightly humid so it doesn't dry out and get all sticky. just remember to remove it before guests come over or you'll have a mess on your hands!"
4,work great,I have these on my taps all the time. They have a great tight seal and come off nice and easy. That's all I can ask for. Thanks
4,great product - great look,"I had this same item for almost 6 years and it was great. Started to deteriorate over the last year but still looked good. I bought another one to replace the old one and as I was putting it on, one of the straps ripped at the attached spot just a little. It is ripped underneath the hood so u can't see it but I hope it doesn't rip any further. Other than that, it is a great product. I should be able to mend the area enough to hold for as long as I have the item."
3,A MUST FOR HOPKINS FANS!,"I believe Hopkins even did the music on this one! Chekovs Uncle Vanya, transposed to turn-of-the-century North Wales, where the peace and tranquillity of a country house is disturbed by the arrival of the estates tyrannical owner and his American wife. Written by Jonathan Broxton {j.w.broxton@sheffield.ac.uk}"
5,really works.....,"I have used this Elm remedy for many years. It works great when I look at my desk and feel overwhelmed. I take a dose of this stuff, and minutes later, I am getting it done.There are other flowers essences that work great too! Scleranthus is great for indecision."
5,Fun FUN Fun Purse,"Everytime I use this purse, I bought mine in Tangerine, I get compliments. It is the perfect size, big but not too big. It has great pockets on the interior walls. I wish I had one in every color!"
3,Very little font used in this book,"The content of the book has no problems, but the real problem is in reading it, because the font is so small, that you need a magnified glass.La obra se la recomiendo a todo el mundo, pues no hay alguien que se considere culto que no haya leido esta obra. Lo que no recomiendo es esta edicion, pues el tamano de la letra es tan pequeno, que es practicamente ilegible."
2,One for the Dimmu & Emperor fans,"This is the 2002 first full-length album from these Brazilian Black Metallers (They had a couple of demos before and have released a second album since).This is one of those albums that I knew nothing about and picked up solely because I thought the cover art looked cool, the song titles sounded interesting and the used price was right.I wouldn't say this album is exactly bad, but it's just not my idea of what Black Metal should be like. But if you're a fan of bands with more of a keyboard sound like Dimmu Borgir or Emperor, I'd say that this album is fairly decent and might be worthwhile checking out. -- Especially if you can pick it up cheap used like I did. (Hey, anybody want mine?)"
3,Just Hurry Up,"The problem I had was with the pace. The description implies that this story is about a British girl who finds an Indian boy and she protects him and returns him to his family. By page 100 she didn't have the kid and I kept thinking when is she going to find him? There were times when I thought it was about to happen only to not happen and well into the 100s I was thinking hurry up and get to it. When she finally finds the kid it's resolved fairly quickly leading me to wonder why so much ephesis was put on this as a storyline.I did like the heroine, and I liked how we got a small hint of romance we got."
4,wonderfully different historical adventure,"Most historical novels that I have read have been set in England or ancient Rome. This was a wonderful, well researched adventure set in the British Raj period of Indian history. The heroine can be annoying at times and the action can be slow but overall a great read. The Indian hero is enigmatic and atttractive. Do yourself a favor, if you purchase this book, buy the two sequels at the same time because you are going to want to see how this story ends. I would advise getting all 3 books and starting on a Friday night, so it doesn't disrupt your work week with late night reading!"
5,Much deserved kudos to the Superstar DJ.,"I love this single because it not only gets you moving, the lyrics are fun. DJs really are Superstars and it's awesome to hear an artist recognize it! I personally dig the electro mix and the star mix. The electro mix ties in some 80's style funk and really shows off Michelle's voice. Can't wait until the whole album comes out!"
2,"Fraud advertising. Listed as made in America, but received item made in china.","This product is not being written about for it's quality, but for my being deceived into buying it thinking it was made in USA. When you go into the made in America sites, these products are listed. This is fraud."
1,brass nozzle,"Ooh! A Brass Nozzle - got to outlast plastic by a lifetime. Wrong!! This nozzle lasted awhile, but it broke apart at the base where it was machine pressed on. Major design flaw. Almost looks deliberate. I would not buy this brand again."
1,After one season use it leaks,"As others have noted, it leaks (actually sprays!) where the pieces are press fit together. Really wanted to like this as the rubber coating keeps it from damaging the hose pot we keep it in. Just ordered the Dramm nozzle for about the same price."
1,Broke after only a few uses,"I thought this nozzle would be the last one I would have to buy for a long time, but it broke after only a few uses. The top snapped right off the connector ring; I was very surprised. Very disappointing!"
1,Contains LEAD.,"This product contains lead. There is a big warning on the back warning the user about lead, and asking the user to wash his hands after using this product. Don't buy this unless you're comfortable with having ALL your yard water flowing through this lead containing nozzle. I returned it unused."
5,Great Product,"Durable, solid, good performance, just what I wanted. No drips, seals well. I purchased this particular nozzle because the types with handles catch and snag when useing my hose reel. It does an excellent job."
2,"Nice Music, but the volume is low","The Orchestra is wonderful, but when I play the music, we can barely hear it unless I turn the volume way up. Even then it is hard to hear until it gets to the loud dramatic parts."
3,World music fan,This CD is different. It's a mixture of North African music with hippy music from the past. Some of the songs I like a lot and others are just not to thrilling. If your looking for something unique I recommend this CD for you. The recording quality sounds good too.
3,In the Loop,"`In The Loop' is the political satire that looks at the American and British rush to war and how they spin it to justify their positions. Sound familiar? There is a lot of swearing and shouting in this film and whilst some of it is quite sharp and funny, a lot of it gets quite wearing by the end. The satire and points raised are quite good and the dry British wit and stiff upper lip and American Bombastic attitudes are wonderfully mocked. The cast is pretty good and play their respective roles in a very deadpan way, Gandolfini is especially good as a Pentagon general. This film has some genuinely humorous moments in it and some biting sarcasm, but you come away startled at the thought that things like this may actually happen in the centres of power around the world and whilst it may be funny to watch for just over 90 minutes, in reality it may be a very scary world we live in!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Comedy of Errors,"The director of this movie must have watched every single episode of the original TV series The Office (the Brit version, not the ghastly US adaptation). From the camerawork to the embarrassed pauses to the dialog... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all. Forget the reviewers who fixate on one character's excessive swearing; what matters is that this is a classic British comedy of embarrassment. Top politicians are essentially hollow idiots, everything is a cock-up rather than a conspiracy, hidden powers guide the world's destiny and the minor players (the protagonists of this movie) don't even get to glance at the script. If you enjoy cringe humor, this is definitely the right film for you. But if you're expecting generic Hollywood ""comedy"" you should look elsewhere."
5,JWVHIII,"This movie has the same appeal that Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf with Burton and Taylor made years ago. It is the equivilant to swimming in a shark tank with hungry sharks. It's fast pace makes having a subtitles button a nice adjunct to help you get by the remarks made by the British characters. This movie takes office politics to a professional level. These charaters fang into each other without hesitation and great efficiancy. The lack of reaction by their victims gives what is essentially a horrible emotional wound and almost acceptable air of civility. Smart and fast paced, this is one of my favorite movies of the last year. The language is diservedly rough but is not out of place. The actors are largely unkown to the U.S. audiences. If you like fast-paced and hard-hitting cerebrial experiences but want to watch rather than participate, you will like In The Loop and should buy it so you can watch it a couple of times and then again later with friends who also belong to MENSA."
4,Laugh Out Loud Satire,"If you appreciate smart quick witted humor, with some vulgarity and critique of the modern day Western Government establishment then you will love this film.The berating one line insults couldn't be better in context unless it was the King of one liners Don Rickels. I was laughing so hard over some of these insults that just fit into the dialogue so naturally and yet so bizarrely, I had to pause and rewind because of the lines I was missing. A satire based on the type of nut jobs we elect and who they appoint to make the most important decisions that impact the lives of Americans here and abroad, is subtle and to the point.As a NYC resident, most people felt past leaders were liars, or evil, but the reality is some are, but most are just plain dumb. Sit back and get an Oxygen tank because you will be laughing so hard. Movies with comedy like this only come as often as an excellent episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"""
4,Funny and disturbing!,"At first I did not like it, but the more I watched the funnier it got. This is not slapstick like Monty Python, but a sharp critique of both politics and media. Some complain about cursing in the movie. I was not bothered by it since I did not see it as a goal in itself but underlining the way politics often is. Brilliant!!"
5,Funniest Political Comedy EVER,This is such a funny movie; can't recommend it enough. But if bad language offends you this is not for you.
1,Superficial and boring,"Incredibly superficial and boring ""political satire"" which relies nearly excuslively on creative profanity for ""humor"". A near total waste of 2 hours. Teens might find it amusing; adults with any intelligence will avoid it."
1,"Ah, James, Why did you do this?","Unless you want to learn every obnoxious effing word in the language, this is not for you! This is merely a political version of a fart movie. Too bad, because the actors did wonderful jobs with the terrible script. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,Garbage,"Garbage passing itself off as political satire. Juvenile wit would be more entertaining than this witlessfoul movie. Oh, I said a four letter word 1000 times, I'm so smart and cool. Gandolfini proves he can playan oaf with the vocabulary of an uneducated dirt bag, again. I guess you have to be ""In The Loop"" to findthis ""intelligent"" satire funny."
2,Not so good,"We found this movie quite boring. We took a break half way through the movie, and mutually decided we had better things to do."
4,very sharp and clever,"i found this political satire quite funny at times.it's quite zany.it moves at a rapid fire,manic pace.i'm sure they just gave the actors free reign to add lib for a lot of the scenes.and it works.there is lots of coarse language,but it's not mean spirited.that's the thing.when the Brits use coarse language,it seems funnier.at least that's been my experience in any British movies/TV shows i've seen.there are also Americans in the cast,and they're also funny.anyway,i really thought his film was a riot.if you're feeling a bit down pop this little gem in your machine,it'll have you in stitches in no time.for me,In the Loop is a 4/5"
5,clever,"Some of the wittiest dialogue ever. If you like a political cynical comedy, which may hit closer to home than you'd like to think, you'll love this precursor to Veep on HBO."
1,sarcasm & parody abound,"I was not able to appreciate all the satire and sarcasm in this movie, maybe if I could, I would have enjoyed it."
4,"Funny, Quirky, Cute","If you like British humor, (which I do), this is just fun. It's manical, whacky, quirky and funny as hell."
5,Vintage Right Stuff,"This review was actually written by the father of the child to whom I gave the book. He is a pilot as is the child's grandfather.""The plane looks just like a red Piper Clipper, so Grandpa Tom will be delighted. Clearly written by someone who has flown taildraggers, as it is a perfect and simple primer in how to fly one properly. I wish I'd had that down in Florida [where he took flying lessons]..."""
3,This House is not up to code....,"First of all,I would like to say that I have been a fan of HOL since their debut cd. I loved it,and thought Sahara was also really good.They have a certain sound and style that a listener immediately can recognize as being their own.I listened to this cd with much anticipation,and unfortunately,disappointment.Some cd's have ""IT"" and some do not. IN MY OPINION,this one does not. If you are new to the group,check out ""Demons Down"" or the more recently released ""World Upside Down"",which is an instant classic.I have not heard the new ""Live in the UK"",but IN MY OPINION,the ""Power & The Myth"" is not as good as any of their studio cd's. But don't take my word,try it for yourself.Just don't say that you weren't warned."
2,Dissapointing,Compared tothe other alnums of House of lords thisdefinatelly is teh worst. No catchy chorus. It just doesn't sparkle. If you want to know House of Lords buy Sahara or Caeresian dreams. then you will know what a great band is really is..
3,Replacement part.,"My son's backboard, which supposedly had a 5 yr. warranty, cracked and a piece fell out at 4 years. Didn't get any help from Spalding, so just replaced it so my son could use it. I wasn't too happy about that.All the holes lined up with the previous backboard's so changing it out wasn't too hard. Definitely a 2 person job though. I managed, but with 2 people probably would have taken 20 minutes instead of 90 minutes. But it's done now, and he's enjoying it so it was worth it.This particular product was a returned item, was in the original box and in good condition. It was missing maybe 3-4 bolts out of the hardware, and they were parts I didn't need anyway. Decent value for the reduced price."
3,"Spalding 48"" Backboard","Backboard seems okay. The polycarbonate is thinner than I would have guessed but seems rigid enough. Before installation there was minor warping when it was laying out in the sun. The warping went away once the backboard was vertical. My guess is that durability won't be that great int eh the So. Cal sun, but time will tell."
4,Great deal for the price,This item worked out great for the kids in my family and the price can not be beat.
1,No good.,"Reading some of the review for this backboard made me reluctant, but I ordered one anyway. Took about 10 seconds after unpacking to decide to return it. The 1/4"" PolyCarbonate backboard material deflects well over 1/4"" with gentle pressure from a finger. There is no way this will provide a fair bounce off the board as it is stiff where the frame is but very flimsy in the sections between. I'm amazed that Spalding even sells something like this. Reinforcing the frame everywhere (eliminating the current large spaces with nothing but the thin backboard) would make it usable, but I think I'll just find a better set.The frame seems adequate, and the rim assembly also appears to be solid--1 star for that. But the backboard itself just ruins it for me."
2,Almost impossible to install alone.,This product is almost impossible to install alone. I ordered the proper installation kit for installing on either a pole or flat wall. I chose to install on a garage wall above the door. Some of the holes were improperly spaced. I had to cut one of the pieces shorter and re-drill a hole in the rim. It would have been much easier if you had a second person to hold the rim while you attempted to install it. The instructions were very confusing as well. Some of the mounting hardware still isn't tight due to incorrect fitting holes.
2,"A triple headache, a double nightmare!","The product itself is OK, but the installation was a nightmare. We had to go out and buy parts since those enclosed were not adequate. The instructions were all wrong and the board could not be assembled or installed by following them. The item had to be returned once because the box was all beat up and there were parts missing The second time the box was also delivered in a very poor condition, but no parts missing. So we decided to keep it since this was a Christmas present for my grandson and this was already the middle of January. We did not expect the nightmare that followed. I wouldn't recommend buying this Backboard from this supplier to anybody."
3,Not made of the best material,"I have to agree with other reviewers here, this board is flimsy. The backboard doesn't have the proper bounce. But for the price I think I got what I expected."
4,good buy,it is good for the price did not find any thing cheaper for this style of back board so far so good
2,Cheap,"The backboard sucks!season 1 - Flimsy backboard, no rebound action and sounds terribleseason 2 - Backboard becomes unglued at the edges - had to reglueseason 3 - Becomes unglued again and cracks - no longer functions R.I.P."
4,Spalding 79354 Backboard/Rim Combo with 48-Inch PolyCarbonate Backboard,"Great value for the money. A very good intermediate grade product. Polycarbonate is supposed to take the outdoor/UV rays better than acrylic. It has options for pole, wall or roof mounting. I also ordered and installed the $99 roof mount adapter (which I also recommend over the $30 unit). Both are very good products. (The roof mount adapter takes some time to put together, but is heavy duty. Its directions are not complete in explaining how to physically attach it to your roof. You need lag bolts to attach it, plus I modified it by drilling two extra holes and adding two more lag bolts at the bottom of the frame next to the edge of the roof to make it more rigid.)"
4,You should get a larger board than this,"It is a great backboard. It is just a little too small. If you want to buy it, you may want to spend a bit more to buy a larger one.It is fairly easy to asemble and install."
4,"the best ""say no more"" album","In my opinion, this is García's best work before Influencia. This opera-rock shows all his genius with acoustic guitars and synthesizers. My favourite tracks are the Overture, Victima (great lyrics), Love is Love, the classical Chipi Chipi, Lament (one minute with Maria Gabriela...we miss you so much), Kurosawa, Andan....actually all the songs are great.I didn't rate this CD with 5 stars because Charly has better albums, but even so, I realize that ""La Hija de la Lágrima"" is tender and moving.No te mueras nunca MAESTRO!!!"
5,A most unusual opportunity for London Visitors,"Mind the Gap is a most unusual book. For an American who travels only occassionally to London, the book opens new opportunities for a focused experience. Living in the southwestern United States, I have not had the experience of traveling on subway systems in many cities, but on my next trip, I certainly intend to use this book as an illustrated guide to the great underground of London. The book itself is a graphic delight. James' perceptive images evoke visions of a glorious past and the phantom image of a person at Wimbledon station connotes the restless rush of the present. Rarely is a person pictured in the starkly beautiful photographs rendering them as icons and elevating them above the merely documentary. This book is a worthy addition to any travel library."
5,Fascinating Images and Archeology,"A wonderful and humorous history of the London Underground. However, this is more than just history, James' photographs create a sense of time and place for the viewer, regardless of whether or not you are familiar with London and it's underground transportation system or not. Perhaps, what struck me most is the how full of color these Underground stations are -- quite unlike anything I've seen in the United States."
5,A Powerhouse Book,"Simon Jame's book Mind the Gap is a stunning powerhouse of a book. It is a winner on all fronts. It is historically educational, added with a great story filled with wit. Jame's photographs are intelligent and aesthetically beautiful. There is something for everybody, including the superb design from cover to cover."
5,Best Fish Oil Out There,This fish oil is very good for the price. Very good quality. ON always makes good products and much safer than other companies. This fish oil helps me recover after a tough work out. You can take 1-3 at a time 2-3 times a day. I usually take 2 at a time on days I lift weights... helps with the recovery/soreness.
5,Happy with purchase,Product as described. I would not recommend these if you have difficulty swallowing larger pills. No bad taste/side effects that I can tell.
3,Buy at Sams,"This stuff is good, I bought some in the past so I checked the price, and it was high. I bought the same stuff at Sams (in the Sams brand) and it is great and has no fishy aftertaste."
2,"cheap plastic, advertised as metal 1""","Was advertised as metal 1"" bubble level with picture and when received it was cheap plastic and not the same as picture that I had ordered."
2,Not as described,"I got mine from Deerso via Amazon. The one I got has clear fluid so the bubble is harder to see. There are additional circles and lines on the display, which is less appealing than a simple circle. Item is 2"" in diameter and 5/8"" high. Too cheap to upset about, would not buy again."
2,Wasn't what I expected. Maybe the low rating?,"As Pat has metioned, a lot of the material in his book he picked up from other books he has read. It does give a realalistic view of day to day frustrations of mlm. To me he lost my interest and turned me off when he started on about his ""new age"" beliefs. If your a strong Christian or don't care about new age doctrine, you can get some good info out of his book. If your looking for how to's on mlm, look elsewhere. If your wondering about common thoughts that mlmers think, it'll be a good read."
4,Mission Statements,"Just wanted to let the readers of this book know that the quote on Mission Statements given by the reader in Kirkland, Washington, is actually quoted and credited in Snetsinger's book to the best-selling author of The Path: Creating Your Mission Statement for Work and for Life, by Laurie Beth Jones. Snetsinger's book is great, but for help in forming and living your mission, read The Path by Laurie Beth Jones. She truly helps you create a brief, succint and focused statement of purpose that can be used in all of life's activities."
4,Great looking fixture. Not great quality,I have a pretty long bathroom and this is the only light in the room. It looks great and works flawlessly. I will say the glass fixtures aren't extremely strong and I broke a very small piece off one.
3,Great read but arrived in poor condition. Clearly not new.,This book is a great read. I was surprising how entertaining the book made a simple conversation. It's probably more entertaining for the fans of U2 since Bono is often promoting causes rather than discussing himself in such detail.My complaint is with the condition of the book I received. It had a stained cover and several of the pages had brown spots all over them. The book smelled horrible as well. It was clearly not a new book. The seller was TheJKBooksalesplace but I believe it was actually fulfilled by Amazon. So maybe it was sitting in a warehouse for several years.
1,WHAT A WASTE OF $$!!!,"I did not even finish this!!... I have No idea what this book was trying to get across... I give Bono credit for the hard work he is doing for Aids but I do not understand where or what this conversation??? was all about...Sorry Bono, I am a big fan of your music, but this book was so confusing and not at all enlightening."
1,self-congratulatory musings by a mediocre intellect,"The idea of a poorly educated rock star influencing global politics would have been laughable in bygone decades, yet this is where we find ourselves, and the self-righteousness of this not-quite-bright-enough god worshiper would be comic if his influence were less palpable.His primary concern (repeated ad-nauseum throughout this lazily compiled, discursive volume) is that Africans are dying, and we don't care. To right this wrong, he advocates forgiving international loans. Let us be clear about this: The loans will be forgiven by using public money. That is, our money. Yours and mine. In other words, a singer-songwriter who is not in any sense elected and has no legal constituency is working busily to appropriate your money to forgive loans that were secured by corrupt foreign despots.This is a really irritating book."
3,Interesting,Some interesting insights into this man's life and the early days of U2. I particularly enjoyed reading about the origins of some of U2's best tracks. A big negative for me was that it was presented as a massive transcript of interviews - Question / AnswerStill an interesting read none-the-less.
4,Honesty,"Before I read this book I loved U2's music but considered Bono, although very hot, to be yet another uneducated pompous ass celebrity with a god complex. After reading the book I realize I was the judgemental pompous ass. Bono is a man of conviction that gets mistaken as arrogance. He believes in something bigger than himself and stands up for it in spite of pompous ass people like me who doubt his sincerity simply because he's a celebrity. Sorry Bono, keep up the good work."
3,Bono Book Interesting But Not Great,"In Conversation was an interesting book that gave some insights into Bono, particularly his faith and his passion for humanitarian work, particularly in Africa. I enjoyed reading it, and would probablly have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read a book that was so much better right after it--Bill Flanagan's U2 At the End of the World, which was one of the few page-turner nonfiction reads I've encountered. Absolutely fascinating. And much of the what is in In Conversation can be found in the At the End of the World too.The conversation was a little too ""real"" which mean't that sometimes Bono repeated himself because he couldn't recall whether he'd said the same thing before. Also, the discussion of the Africa situation got a little dense at times--and because Bono is absolutely committed to debt relief, AIDs work etc, he talks about this subject a LOT!Fans of U2 will enjoy the book."
3,Great music bad sound,"This is the sort of record that inspires you to go on a search and find the sound engineer so you can murder him. Just as in John Stevens' 'Application Interaction And...' cd (which, to make the engineer's reputation even more shaky, was recorded in the studio in 1978!) this set has FANTASTIC music but fails to completely release it's potential because of the sonic short comings (in short, sound is as a 'good' bootleg). The music is in the usual John Stevens Brit free jazz trio of late 70's which (if you are reading this) probably already know. As always, Mike Osbourne (sax) is on fire and even plays a couple of 'standards' (which is rare). Bassist is almost inaudible in places. Conditionally recommended."
2,"Disappointing, not as good as expected.",The teacher do not demonstrate West Coast Swing dance with clear distinct movements and style. They merely walk through the steps without any rhythm and techniques. You would not enjoy dancing West Coast Swing from the way you are taught on the tape.
2,ultimate beginner video,"The title ""ultimate"" west coast swing dance video is very misleading. This is not only a ""beginner"" video...it should be advertised as a video for people who have never done a dance step in their lives. The teachers are nice looking and very pleasant, but goodness...I kept having to fast forward the tape to find a ""lesson"" somewhere. By the end of the tape all I had learned was a couple of very simple steps...certainly not enough for me to start dancing! Good tape if it were advertised correctly, but definitely not the ""ultimate."""
2,Wrong Style for WCS,"Here in the East and probably in most of the US, the WCS is a dance done to blues, soul, motown Al Green, Wilson Pickett, etc. (music with a beat and soulful sound). This video is off base. The istructors in their western outfits teach WCS as a country type dance with no emphasis on soul, rythym or blues (the heart of this dance). When not laughing, giggling or cracking corny jokes, they are competent in teaching something about the basic steps. Albeit in a bland, marching ""do dah"" style that may suit a country bar but will get you laughed at in a social dance or nightclub. Princeton, NJ."
4,Add this to your arsenal,"Books on day trading are everywhere! Hmm...is this book for you you ask? This book should be read by all beginner to intermediate traders. Many people think that they can find ONE book out there and read it and make $$$. It's not like that in this profession. Would you be a lawyer after reading one book, much less without a degree? So this book is a tool, and a good one at that. No fluff here, just the experiences of someone who trades. If you wake up and sit in front of your monitor from 7:30am to 4pm watching Nasdaq Level II screens and daily/intraday charts...they this book will help you. He shows you HIS experiences in the market. Like I said in my headline....add this to your arsenal of solid daytrading books."
1,Save your money,"Save your money, this book was writen for the dart throwing era of 98-99 and is worthless in a sideways or bear market. It's the same old story, those who can trade do, and those that can't write books."
2,it's okay,"For $10.00 this game is alright. I wasn't expecting a lot for ten dollars. What I got was a standard chess game with lots of different boards, and some varying levels of difficulty. There isn't a heck of a lot more. Serious chess enthusiasts will not gain a lot here - no real analytical tools, nothing that will outright help you think about strategy. Beginners won't get a lot of help either. There are very easy levels, but not a lot of support for a novice.The graphics are pretty good, and if you like to just play a game of chess against a computer, buy it. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. If you are just killing time with a game of chess and don't care too much about graphics, better to play for free online."
4,absorbing!,"For those who are huge fans of historical Western romances ACROSS THE SWEET GRASS HILLS will be most satisfying as it is romantic & much more. It is a glimpse into how our prejudices are nurtured, our paranoias inflamed, & a view from the other side of the looking glass at a time in our history that was both dreadful & exciting.Quite well done."
4,A great photography book!,"This is a great book of photographs, representing well Sugimoto's work over time. Printing quality and bounding are sublime. However, as other reviewer mentioned, the book's format is relatively small. To fully appreciate Sugimoto's work, it needs to be viewed in full scale, but with over 300 pages, that is almost impossible. With a hard cover, the book is already heavy and voluminous in its present format.A few words that come in mind when viewing Sugimoto's work: Japanese aesthetics, minimalism, intellectual, somewhat cold, static and precise. I am a fan of such work, but if you prefer emotional drama, look elsewhere.Overall a great addition to one's photobooks library."
4,Great specific tool,"It's good knife for specific tasks. It is inconvenient to use on some tasks due to the finger grooves. Not a dood bushcraft knife or defense knife. When fisting the knife, your palm tends to push down on the lock back."
5,A great knife,"I am a long time Spyderco knife owner. This is one of my favorites (the predecessor to this one got lost on a trip.) This knife is well built, the perfect weight, and most importantly has a clip that can be moved to the opposite side of the handle for left-handed users (like me.)"
4,good for color,great game and superb graphics. hard to see on grayscale pda's. I reccomened this if you have a color version pda.
1,Don't let the ideas get in the way of good writing,"A very smart woman; a poorly executed book. This book is intended for nobody to read. Bell's inexcusable writing style can only be described as pretentious. She challened no ideas, fronts or philosophies on her own. I also read all 223 pages, and I agree with another reviewer that there are so many references she fails in creating a position for herself. Many references she cites have the same positions, so why read something that is poorly written."
2,"It's really an address book, not a guest book","Although this is billed as a guest book, it's more like an address book. It might be good if you just want people to enter their name, address, and a couple of short notes, but i wanted something for a cabin, where people can feel free to write as much as they wanted. Each page has about 5 separate lines for 5 different entries, which might be ok for a big event (wake, wedding, etc.), but not for a cabin guest book. I had to return it, unfortunately. Otherwise, it really is a very nice book (hence the 2 stars). My wife wanted to keep it anyway because it was such a nice book. I would not have ordered this item if Amazon had a ""look inside"" tab; maybe they can add this feature for this item."
2,Guest Book?????,"I was terribly disappointed in this book! Upon seeing the picture, I assumed (incorrectly) that the book had the engraving on the front in white. Instead it was all brown. It was engraved, but you can hardly see it. Since it was advertised as a guest book, I thought (incorrectly) that it would have a place for the name of the event and look like a guest book should look. Instead it looks more like an address book. We had a hard time getting anyone to sign it because of this! This was purchased for my daughter's Open House for her 1st home, so wanted it to be just right, didn't happen! I just feel the description and picture were less than informative and very misleading! On the good side (only one I could find) it seems to be made of quality leather and should last a long time."
5,The Best,"I went on a cruise, had a facial, and had this product recommended. It is very light weight on my face and absorbs quickly. I use this in combination with the Pearls of Youth from LaTherapie. I have learned how many upscale, but expensive products from Europe, have been around for awhile. I am so glad I took the facial on the cruise and had the European trained practitioner use them and recommend them to me. These products are so effective when used together. It is the best I have used and I am getting great results. Before you could only get them on cruises-now they are available in more locations."
4,"Great cartoon, the episodes are still fun to this day...but there is one problem on this DVD.","I just had to make a quick review in order to see if anyone else who owns this DVD has experienced the same issue. On Disc 1 of Conan The Adventurer Season 2 Vol. 1. there seems to be a problem with the episode entitled ""The Red Brotherhood"". Towards the end of that particular episode(about 16-17 min into it), there is a noticeable line towards the top of the screen that seems to be either an animation error/defect when the episodes where first created.Has anyone else experienced this same problem while viewing this episode? I'm curious, so please let me know."
5,Very Entertaining!!!!!!,"I didn't watch this as a kid. I thought how in the world could they make a cartoon for kids based off of Conan the Barbarian. I saw the movie back then. No way. Then there was the complete Serpentor rip-off outfit and I was done. But I love cartoons so as an adult I thought, ""what the hey."" These cartoons are very entertaining in my view. I'm glad I bought them. Stories are not half bad and the animation is 80's based. I like this. I'm enjoying the story arcs. Some of the episodes come off as single shows but there is an underlining story of collecting all the star metal and finding a cure for his parents. Enjoyable and a lot of fun."
4,The answers to WHY,Dr. Sacco truly answers many of the questions that people have about relationships. If you are like me anw want to know why marriages fail and why women pick the men that they do instead of good guys like yourself this book has the answer. The situations Dr. Sacco relates to have happened to many if not all the people in this nation. By reading this book you can gain a better understanding of why certain situations occur in the hopes of being able to correct the problem.
2,"Ok watch, bad customer service","My father needed a watch with a light and large numbers. This watch was one of the few found. My dad also wanted a leather band so I ordered this one. It was inexpensive and looked it, it was also shipped with a gold band. To return, i either had to wait for an envelope, return it and wait for a replacement. Or I could have ordered a new another one and get reimbursed when I returned the first one. I chose the first option. The whole process took about a month and half. Considering they made the mistake, I expected more action on their part to correct the order. I wouldn't recommend them."
2,Classic? Cuban?,"""Classic"" in the title of the book is a misnomer as many of the recipes utilize ingredients that are not traditionally used in Cuban cooking. The book is missing many of the basics and messes with the ingredients you'd find in your classic dishes. The information that is provided about the classic usage of chilis in many dishes and the whole section on hot salsas is just not classic Cuban. While the book provides some interesting takes on classic Cuban cooking, don't look to it to recreate Cuban dishes that you'd get in a Cuban home or restaurant. Overall, I found it inauthentic. Although if you're well versed in Cuban cooking and want to do some Latin fusion by adding some other favors to your cooking it may be a good choice."
4,another good adoption story,We read every adoption story we can get our hands on. This is a neat one. Our adopted chinese daughter enjoyed it.
5,Children of Sanchez,I've always found this a very moving soundtrack. I've not seen the movie. The highs and lows and excitement in the music paint the story for me.
4,"So near yet so far, just a little short of Utopia!","I had been searching for replacements of my old worn out tapes of this classic music. At last a CD which will last and last but one BIG disappointment. Why oh why did they not have the vocal in ""Lullabye"" one of my favourite ""tear jerkers "" Does anyone know where I can get a tape or CD or even LP with the lyrics of this beautifully poignant tune?"
5,Excellent books for make penetration testing...,"This book cover a width range of themes, include security for winnt, unix. Also cover security with CGI, Java.. Excellent !!!"
4,"Good. Does not provide a ""how to"" way to protect a Business.","This book provides very good advice on how security works, and some way hackers had invaded systems.Includes, Java, CGI, SATAN, Kerberos but lacks an step by step advice to protect networks. The book is all about Unix..."
5,Good book!,"I find it odd how all of the negative reviews for this book come from ""fake"" people. If you truly want people to take you review seriously, use your real name. Funny how the reviews that come from ""real names"" are so much better than these fake name-calling reviewers. I read the book from my local library and was pleased with it. It was not the best book I've read this year, but far from the worst. It's a thought provoking good read."
1,Awful book,"This book was poorly written and full of inaccuracies about the life of Christ. It makes him into a sci-fi type of superhero who has to learn to control his ""superpowers"", which suprise even himself (since he doesn't know who he is). It's one of the downers of this book that Jesus is shown as accidentally killing a boy with his superpowers because he hadn't learned to ""control"" them yet. Moreover, Mary is portrayed as a pathetic, weak and constantly crying woman. In addition, the book is boring and lacks action. The most interesting part of the book was the writer's explanation of her own faith and the research she did for this book - research that unfortunately is not evident in the book itself."
1,The Most Boring and Tedious Story Ever Told,"I can't remember ever reading such a boring book. There really is no ""plot"" in the conventional sense. Now that King Herod has died, seven year old Jesus and his family return to Isreal from hiding in Egypt. Nothing of any substance happens. It is writen in the voice of seven year old, which is gets annoying real early. [...]"
3,Not bad but not great either..........average,"I would give it a C+I was expecting more, but got average.It was a good concept, but could have been done with more excitment, more indepth, ecspecially since your talking about the boy Jesus. Maybe I was just a little too excited about this book comming out therefore I was expecting much more then what I read. Im not sorry that I read it, It just wouldnt be a book that would come up out of conversation with me where I would tell someone else to read it."
2,Y-A-W-N,"I'm delighted that Anne Rice has re-entered into an active life of faith in God. Her personal ""witness"" at the end of her new novel was the best part of the read. The novel itself drags on mercilessly without much action or interesting dialog. To her credit, Anne Rice did do her research and she didn't cheat. She read broadly from the theological spectrum of ideas and undertook some fine critical thinking of her own and for that, I applaud her. Unfortunately, the price of the book was not worth these few pages."
2,not impressed,"For me Anne Rice has always been a little hit and miss, and this novel is no exception. There was nothing I liked about this novel. The writing was sub-par, the material was bland and flowery. Granted she took on a different aspect of Christ's life, and I could tell she did her research, but the end result wasn't a compelling book. Anne Rice needs to go back to writing about vampires because if this is what her future writing is going to be like, I will be tuning out.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
2,out of egypt,quite boring.. so many names & places that mean nothing to me.. i am @ 60% on my kindle.. waiting for something ..
2,Yawn,"I regret to inform that Anne Rice has been reduced from an open minded author with original ideas, to a narrow minded christian.This book will be interesting for:* those who have never read or heard about the time period Jesus grew up* christians and other book-religious peopleOtherwise, nothing really interesting happens in this book. At least for people who have been exposed to more than a bible.I'm sorry to lose such a great author to the, in my opinion, real dark side. I give it 2 stars for the research work, 0 for the story.Sorry, Anne Rice. I will still read your old books"
1,Servant of the Bones meets The DaVinci Code,"[...] If you enjoy Anne Rice's writing style then you'll like this book. But one of the reasons I like Anne Rice's Vampire and other gothic tales is that she explores morality and ethics beyond, and in spite of, faith. Here she does a 180 and embraces the myths of Christianity and seems to say that faith in needed for good. I guess I am disappointed in this new interest of hers because her rationalization for atheism in The Vampire Lestat was sublime. The writing is classic Rice; the themes are weak."
1,"Stick to fiction, Anne","Why is it when celebrities like Mel Gibson and Anne Rice have some sort of ephipany, they feel compelled to educate the masses on their beliefs by mass-marketing fiction? Like the Passion of the Christ, this book was based on a purely Catholic point of view and is biblical only on the major points. I have to admit I was turned off early on when she wrote about Jesus' siblings not truly being blood brothers, but were Joseph's from a former marriage? Where does it say that in the Bible? If you truly want to learn about the life of Christ, don't turn to highly popular but fictional stories--go to the original source, the Bible."
1,...,This is an interesting move on the author's part to begin from the fiction work of the special powers of vampires and now move to the equally fiction work of the special powers of Christ.
2,Lost in faith?,"Anna Rice reconversion to catholicism also spells the beginning of the end for her imagination, creativity, openness, and even world view. This book is a testimony to this unfortunate reality. While the latest trends in spirituality and research on Jesus, has led to the conclusion that Jesus was simply a wise man, an old and wise soul, yet married with a son, Anne Rice falls back on her old faith, revealing to her readers a tunnel vision. In a time when america is becoming a dangerous coutry filled with religious fanatics, this book reinforces the fallacy that Jesus was divine, a belief or blind faith that has led humanity to murder in the name of jesus, and to deny the existence of our divine self and responsability to ""know thyself"", the true secret to life as revealed by Jesus, Buddha and Sacrates."
4,The Humanity of the Divinity,"This is my first Anne Rice book. I had heard of the vampire tales and seen the movie, so I approached this book with some apprehension. It was unwarranted. Regardless of the actual history, her approach is respectful. She does a good job of explaining how the conclusion that ""I am the Son of God"" might be reached, reasonably, by the one experiencing that conclusion.I'll definitely be reading more of these books. They bring a new dimension to my faith."
3,An interesting disappointment,"Although the subject matter will of course interest Anne Rice's longtime fans as well as readers of faith, the story presentation is far too simplistic and requires the reader to suspend more belief than can be reasonably expected. An attempt by ANY writer to ""get inside the head"" of the divine will of course fall short, but this reader had the definite impression that Rice was simply eager to somehow pay tribute to her newly-rediscovered religious faith rather than to present a convincing portrait of the son of God.Rice's research is evident but her unique voice and human insight are absent here, and that's NOT because this reviewer ""would rather just read about vampires."" Three stars for a nice effort and a good view of history, but as a biography, however fictional, of Jesus Christ it's a disappointment."
3,Christ the Lord,"First of all, this is a fiction. It is amazing how many religious fanatics jump up on the soapbox to berate a fictional text as needing to be an approved and authorized document. If you seek true religious guidance, seek elsewhere, this is a delightful fictional text, well written, well structured and delivering in what it promises, a story, period. Ann Rice has a positive genius for weaving texture and character in text, drawing the reader into the fantasy world she creates, with ease and the fine skill of a world class surgeon. For those seeking to belabor the point of accurate versus inacurate, try picking on Superman or Batman, both are equally fictional in content, but you'll find the average reader of those right at your intellect level, childish."
1,kitschy bad taste,"The best thing that can be said about Rice's foray into god-botherer territory is that she takes a fairy tale figure and turns it into kitch fiction. If you want to experience an explosion of Catholic bad taste, dip into this Christmas turkey. You will not be dissapointed. It reads like the Jesus-on-the-way-to-calvary and the sublime rosary f**k sequences from John Waters' 'Multiple Maniacs'. In a word, jaw-dropping."
2,I don't want to read this book,"I used to read all Ane Rice novels, I don't do it anymore. Somewhere along the line I find their new books not interestingly enough so now I prefer to read the reviews and then decide to read (buy) the book or not. Frankly I think that if I was interested in reading about Jesus life (which must be interesting, endearing and valuable) I would choose another writer."
1,The Turn-about,"I had heard Anne Rice had converted to the Catholic religion and was so incredibly devoted to it that she just had to write books about the life of Christ. No more horror for her!Well I guess she did not make enough money to make it worth while, so she announced she was going back to writing the other stuff.It made her books about Christ cheap and deceitful.I threw the book away."
2,Highly ambitious though unfortunately dull change of pace for Rice.,In an interesting change of pace Anne Rice chronicler of sexy vampires turns her attention to the youth of Jesus who is just discovering his purpose in life.Unfortunately there's such a large cast of characters and so many conflicts between men and soldiers the book often loses sight of Jesus.The recent Mel Gibson film about Jesus's last day may have been over the top but at least it was dramatcally compelling.This book despite being well researched and stripped of Rice's sometimes overly poetic style is uninvolving.As Jesus moves from location to location it's hard to care what happens next.Disappointingly flat though Rice deserves credit for trying something different that's close to her heart.
3,It didn't hit me emotionally like some Biblical fiction...,"I've read a lot of Biblical fiction, but for some reason this just didn't have the emotional punch that the others did. My favorite is ""Two From Galilee: The Story of Mary and Joseph"" by Marjorie Holmes.Overall though it was very well written, and apparently the author did a huge amount of historical research, although I was puzzled by her take on Jesus' mother, Mary. First, of all the characters, Mary seems the most distant and least developed character.Second, Anne Rice seems to jump through every conceivable literary hoop to maintain Mary's lifelong virginity. The Bible shows, in multiple passages, that Mary and Joseph had other children. Perhaps it's her Catholic background? After all the research she did for the book, though, I am left scratching my head how she came to that conclusion."
3,A different view of the Childe,"Anne utilizes Thomas' Infancy gospel writings for building her tale of the child Jesus. She totally disavowed Jesus' siblings-most notably James the Just who became the leader of His Church.I have read all of Rice's books and know that although many have been great, Interview with the Vampire, Cry to Heaven, Lasher, there were some slower reads and this fell into that category but her research for this novel was terrific.This book could have been more interesting if the Child wasn't so unaware of his great Mission, as it was a developed recognition."
2,"Subject Interesting, Book Boring","A year in the life of a seven year old Jesus is an interesting topic at first glance. But then again, a perfect child, with perfect parents and a perfect brother don't do much to inspire my interest. Rice writes firmly within her new found Catholic Orthodoxy and for those who believe in this particular conservative brand of theology her juvenile Christ may well inspire. She takes a well researched but narrow minded scope of first century life in Palestine, and her characters never seem to live as real people except to further her own brand of religion."
3,Out of Egypt - Anne Rice,"This is the fictional story of Christ's childhood from his, a child's, perspective. While it may be educational for those who do not realize that Christ was Jewish, it clearly is fiction hanging on a skeleton of ""fact"". It is an ambitious and brave project for Anne to take on, and I find it somewhat boring."
1,My second review of this work,"After reading it a second time I can only say...its worse. The book is SO Biblically inaccurate it should be tough for believers to read without rolling one's eyes 1000 or so times. For example, James, the charater so many other reviewers like, was in fact not Jesus' older brother as is depicted in the book (yes, I know its fiction). Jesus in fact was the oldest of Mary's children (hence....she was a virgin) and Mary was Joseph's first wife (hence....he had no other children before Jesus). At age 7 Jesus did in fact have a cousin James, who would have been about 13, the son of Alphaeus. Jesus' brother James was Mary's second born and at the time Jesus was 7 James was about 5. In Anne's book not only does she makeno reference to any of Jesus' half siblings she openly states Mary and Joseph never had relations.Again, I know its fiction, but come on."
1,SNORE!!!!!,"I swear every time I pick this book up to try and read it I fall asleep. It's hard to follow, and I just can't get into it. I will be donating this to the Library..."
2,Not her best book,"I love Anne Rice's books. I own most of them. I am a huge fan, so when I purchased this book I had high expectations. The book is about Christ's childhood, him growning up. Now it's not about his entire childhood, just a section of it. It is written beautifully, just the plot is a bit of a dissapointment. There really is no plot. It's christ and his family traveling. It can be a teadious read if you have read her other books. This is not as slow as ""feast of all saints"", but it does take a couple of chapters to pick up speed. If you are wanting a great read of Anne Rice's work the ""witching Hour"" Series is wonderful, as well as the vampire books she has published. This is a book for more determined readers, it does take a bit to plow through it. Over all it is an ok read."
2,Dull in an atypical Anne Rice way...,"I was really excited to see this book (I buy everything Anne Rice writes while it's still in hardcover - I'm a die-hard fan). This book was SUCH a disappointment to me. I had to force myself to read it through. The only ""positive"" thing was it gave some historical context through ""personal experience"" pov, but really, my feeling after having read this book was simply, ""Well, I read it..."" Almost as bad as ""The Violin""."
4,simple & lovely,I am a Jewish woman and a great fan of Anne Rice's writing. This was a beautiful story of someone I know very little about. The history of the times was delicious and moved me to contemplate life in simple terms. I recommend this highly and hope for more historical writings from Rice in the near future.
3,Anne Rice's Take on The Bible,"I thought that this book was written in a nice way. It was very difficult to keep track of all the characters at first, but then you begin to look past that. I read this book in a day. I did not really feel that it was too difficult to read, but I did feel like I had already read most of the content in the Bible. I did like that it had a unique touch to it since it is written in a way that makes it seem as if a young Christ is telling the story himself. I would not be interested in owning this book though, and I would not recommend it to anyone..it was just ok."
4,Would def. make an interesting movie with the right script...,"Written from the perspective of Jesus as a 7-year-old, this is a delicate rendering of what the author thinks may have run through his mind leading up to his discovery of 'who' he is. The book moves slowly and carefully weaving subtly bits of all the gospels and early Christian legend regarding Jesus. It is an interesting read... esp. the quite long Author's Note which details Rice's return (after a long stay as a athiest) to rather Orthodox Catholicism theology (even though she appears to still hold liberal political views - I think). It would no doubt make for an interesting - though no doubt controversial - film, if ever done."
3,"Not as good as ""The Morning Tree""","This is an interesting story about a young Jesus, and how life might have looked from his eyes as a young boy. Most of the story focuses on his his powers, and how that would have set him apart from others. Talk about an unusual adolescence. I particularly enjoyed learning the historical aspect of how things were then. I liked this, but preferred ""The Morning Tree"" by Austin Reams."
3,First Rice Novel,"This is a very interesting concept and for the most part Rice does a admirable job. This is the first novel of hers that I ever read so I can't compare it to her previous works, but I found her writing to be ""lean"" to say the least. It was almost like reading a childrens story. Of course, she was telling the story in the first person so maybe that is why she wrote that way, I really don't know. The best part was the afterword where Rice explains how she, as an atheist, came to the place spiritually that lead her to write this book. I was very moved by her experience and found that both the book and her personal account rang true. While I struggled a bit with her writing style, I'm very glad I read the book and I'm wondering if she plans to continue it into a series."
4,Interesting Fiction,"while the book is a decent read, Anne Rice's personal commentary on her journey of faith while writing this book (provided as a post script) remains the most fascinating thing about it. however, the content provides a colorful understanding of the cultural backdrop behind the story of the life of joseph mary, & jesus christ."
3,"A slow read, but somewhat rewarding in the end","I have to admit, about half way through I almost gave up. It was just slow to me, with no real plot, moving along aimlessly. But I'm glad that I continued to read to the end. It definitely picked up and I felt it had some purpose to it by its conclusion. The book does help the reader to think of Jesus as a real person, with real feelings, concerns and experiences. I like her take on how Jesus came to see who he was and what his mission was on earth. Slow, but a somewhat interesting read overall.The most redeeming part about the entire book is the section in the end where she describes her own journey back to Christ."
3,Benign and Boring,"There was nothing remarkable about this book. It wasn't good; it wasn't bad. It wasn't exceptionally well written, but it also wasn't poorly written. I understand it was supposedly exhaustively researched, but I found nothing in it that I hadn't already known from my religious studies classes in college and independent reading of some of the non-canonical gospels. In short, I expected a lot more than what was delivered. It was dry and lacking any real emotional depth, which given that it was written from a child's POV is somewhat understandable - but still nothing that really made me sit up and take notice. The best I can say for this book is that it was an easy read and entirely benign."
1,So Very Boring,"Anne Rice lends a voice to the Christ-child in her novel, Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt. Through the eyes of a very young Jesus, the reader learns about the return of the holy family from Egypt, as well as Jewish culture, and how Jesus learned his true identity.Obviously, this novel is quite a departure for Anne Rice. I do not have an issue with the subject matter, nor do I take issue with any minor historical inaccurracies. My problem with this novel was how truly boring it was. Rice is capable of spellbinding her reader through vivid description and crafting an intriguing tale. Unfortunately, she did neither of those things here. The plot, if you will, was extremely dry. The reader learned more about the surroundings of the characters than about the characters themselves. Her narrative tone was flat and unimaginative.The bottom line is that I was very disappointed with this book. It was not at all what I expected. I cannot honestly say I would recommend it."
4,Christ the lord out of cana,"This book was a little slower to start with than the first book, but still captured my imagination. The ""good parts"", where Jesus realizes his power, are an inspiration to us all. It allows you the reader to feel God is here for you by making Jesus a normal man of flesh and blood. He feels anxieties, he has desires, he is searching for his future just like us all."
5,Excellent work,"Anne Rice's new book is excellent. Easy to read, she weaves a wonderful story built upon her indepth research. I didn't want the book to end and I'm hoping she's writing a sequel about Jesus' teenage years. If you like Christian reading material, historical fiction, or just thought provoking literature, I highly recommend."
3,An OK read,Anne does not rise to the style of CS Lewis or others but she managed to tackle a difficult subject. For Christians like myself it was an interesting read.[...]
4,A Story Worth Reading,I'm not aware of any artist making such a dramatic turn in genre so effectively. Anne Rice's faith certainly has moved her to write an enjoyable and inspirational novel. I takes a lot of guts to rite fiction about Jesus. I'm pleased that Rice had enough. Looking forward to the next one.
4,Fascinating insights,"The life of Jesus as presented in the Bible leaves many questions about his young life. There are a few hints, the Temple, the time in Egypt. This book describes a plausible life that the young Jesus could very well have lead. The most fascinating part of the book, however, is the author's notes at the end. Great discussion and sources for further study."
4,an amazing journey back in time,"just read the book, loved it. I thought it may have been too short though. it leaves me wanting more. i do love the way anne rice can take you too the period she writes about, it was as though I was there. Ive never really read the bible, and was not really familiar with all the characters and locations, but rice guides the reader through it all wonderfully. it is nice to have the internet to research a little further. to make a few connections and clarify a few things i had to look up a map just to see how far the journeys were, and also wikipedias section on jesus helped me make a few connections about characters that jesus interacted with at age 7 was related to what would happen later in his life. I loved learning about a time period and history that ive known very little about. the authors note was also great."
5,Who Else Would Do It?,"In all of my years of reading and writing, it never came to mind. The idea of writing a well researched ""novel"" about the life of Jesus at 7 years old and in the first person. How brilliant was that? Or was it an elightenment?I cannot put it down and have not. Read it three times, hoping the months will pass fast in order I can read the next volume. This is a superb work from one brave enough to try it! Bravo!"
2,Anne should stick to Vampires..,"Jesus as a child...here I am hoping for some eye poping story and all I get is a story not worth reading. Folks... if you must read everything about Jesus then read it. If you are looking for some good ol' page turner of finger burning kind, this isn't it.I have just one question for Anne....How did you manage to make Jesus less interesting than Lestat?"
3,A great victory!,"After just finishing Anne's book these are my thoughts. It's a good book and a pretty quick read but it reads like a history book and at times too much detail; sometimes too slow. It does however, like any good book stick with you afterwards and becomes thought provoking. I enjoyed the afterward as much as the book though and am considering reading some of her recommended books.My overall thought on the book is God has brought Anne full circle back to Him as he has for so many of us. By using her gifts of research of writing to produce a work so different than what she had been writing. Now hopefully this work will impact someone who is not a Christian but a Anne Rice fan to seek Jesus more. This is a great victory for someone who had been immersed in atheistic culture for so long, so kudos to Anne. She has then returned her gifts back to God where it may become a blessing and a tool to reach others to Christ"
4,Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt,This is not her usual style of book. It is well written and the narritive seems real. It is a must read for Anne Rice fans
2,Could have been better.,"This book is fiction and I read it as such. Therefore I will leave the discussion of historical and religious accuracies to the historians and theologians. I found the story interesting but would have liked to see more development of the characters and the relationships between the characters. The characters felt flat and one dimensional as did the interaction between the characters. As I was reading, I could not believe that this was a 7 year old boy who was speaking. It read more like an adult attempting to sound like a child and failing. There are a number of instances in this novel that could have been elaborated on (Why was that character always laughing?). The plot could have been stronger. As I said, I found the concept interesting, but expected better from a seasoned author."
2,This is not a Christian book,"I am a Christian and I love to read Christian fiction. This book is NOT a Christian fiction book. Ann Rice is a wonderful writer but should stick with her previous genre. A word of caution to all reading this book... This is total fiction. This is no historical evidence that any of this stuff is fact. There is zero historical evidence to what she is saying in this book.I feel that should be obvious as it is a fiction book, however people quote her book now as fact. I am more than just a Christian, I am also a Children's Pastor. I simply must say this book did not live up to what I was hoping Ann Rice would produce in her new found relationship with Christ."
5,One of the best,So sad to see so many ignorant people can just read a book an appreciated for what it is...a Novel.
1,Disappointed,Loved all the Vampire Books from Anne Rice .. she is a wonder at those stories as many many people know .. but discovering her faith does not mean she is able to write as tho she knows Christ .. since she just recently found Him .. her charactors fall flat .. so very disappointed .. and discarding her most skilled writing about vampires is sad ... she could be doing both .. I can't read any more of Ann Rice if she will not bring her Fans any more Vampire Novels ... I have a collection of her books .. and will be finding someone who will enjoy them .. because I am finding a new author for my love of Vampire novels .. and one has emerged.. I am very impressed with Douglas Clegg and his triogy .. so am moving on ....
3,Disappointing,"Not sure what I expected of this one, but the book was a bit of chore to clunk through."
1,This book is better left alone.,"Page 1: Jesus at age 7 ""kills"" another boy by cursing him. What, are you kidding me? Even though it comes off as Jesus, in his childhood innocence, killed the boy by ""accident"", it still doesn't fly in the face of His divinity. She is trying to strip Him of his Godhood and make Him into a bumbling human with flaws and sins. That is treading on dangerous literary ground. He could not have succeeded in His mission on earth if He went to the cross as a sinner. He had to be the perfect sacrifice, without sin, in order to wipe the slate clean for the rest of us."
3,"Good, but different","I was torn with this book, I love Rice's style, and she can always tell a story that sucks you in, but at the same time I had a very hard time with her writing in the first person as Christ. However I did enjoy her interpretation/thoughts on what the life of young Jesus was like, even if I dont necessarily agree with her. She sure can tell a story!"
5,A Fun Book,"A delightful story that is surely to offend someone. We know very little of Jesus between his birth and the start of his ministry as as adult. So why not make up a coming of age story.So he has miraculous gifts, healing the sick for instance. How do parents explain this to a seven year old? It was bad enough to answer where do baby's come from questions.Then when at about age twelve the little girl he played with is changing her interests to home making and babies. Why doesn't she want to go out and play any more?This book was an excellent idea, well executed."
1,Christ the Lord on CD.,"Narrator Josh Heine does such a poor job of reading Christ the Lord on CD that it takes away from the content. All the characters sound the same. You don't know which person is talking until you hear ""he (she) said."" Maybe he was chosen because he has a rather high voice and is supposed to sound like a young boy, but he sounds the same when he reads the parts of the old men. I listen to a lot of books on tape so I have a pretty good basis for comparison. Anne Rice gets an A for her book, but Josh Heine gets a D minus for his reading of it."
2,Pallid Narrative,"My respect and admiration for Anne Rice runs at a very high level, but I found this latest effort very disappointing. I'm sure her motive in sharing her return-to-the-Church epiphany is altruistic, but the text seems stale and plodding and not at all in keeping with the enthusiasm expressed in her author's note at the end. My selfish hope is that the next story set in Egypt will be a sequel to ""The Mummy."""
5,A great change for Rice,"Although I am a fan of vamp books, I did not click with Rice's works. The only book I liked of hers that I love and reread is The Mummy. Christ the Lord is another one on the love list. Told in first person by a 7 year old Jesus, it opens the reader to the Jewish culture and gives us an insight to what Jesus might have been in the beginning as he discovers that he is not like the others. Told with grace, I kept reading this and look forward to other books from the 'born again' Rice. Everyone has their path to the Light, and this book may let some readers start toward it. A very nice read."
3,"Interesting, but not her usual quality...","This book does not grab you and take off like the Vampire Chronicles or the Chronicles of the Mayfair Witches. (But hey, not every book can be about Lestat!) It starts out rather slow and I hardly recognize Anne Rice's style in its paragraphs. What I did find interesting, however is the insider's look at the Jewish Culture of this period. It is superbly researched and the historical accurancy must leave even some bibical scholars reeling in surprise."
2,Inconsistent Anne,"Rice is great writer, and I liked being transported back to ancient Nazareth but there are some major problems with Anne's understanding of her new faith. Catholics believe that not only Jesus but Mary and Joseph as well knew who Jesus was from the very beginning. Christ was fully man and fully human; at no time did he not know who he was. The idea that Jesus could, not knowing who he is, accidentally wish someone dead is completely unbelieveable and is very offensive to Catholics (or at least to those Catholics who understand their faith). Rice should have spent more time researching her new faith before she decided to write about it. If she had, this could have been five stars."
3,Tangled,"I only heard how good the Vampire Chronicles were. I thought this could be interesting and encouraging. Yet, I felt like I was stumbling reading this book. For me, it was and is very hard to get through. At times it seems simplistic and then overly complicated. The first paragraphs felt like the proverbial hook. I kept waiting to get pulled in but became tangled instead. The pages were a nice touch. Ann Rice has obviously changed to more positive writing. I will look forward to something she does in the future along these lines. The history, names and obvious research were impressive."
4,Rev. Cliff,I found that Anne Rice did a surprising job of research for the book. It is a very plausable linage of events in the early life of Jesus. I especially liked the questioning and searching that went on in Jesus' early life. The accounts of civil unrest at this time was convincing.Anne Rice's comments about who she is at the end of the book was very helpful. I am not sure about her conclusions but it will cause me to rethink some of my concepts of that time and the writing of the gospels.
1,"Boring Book, Great Subject","I'm a bit surprised by all the rave reviews this book has received, I guess the simple fact that Lestat-Anne Rice simply writing anything remotely religious made a lot of reviewers ignore this book's major flaws.The book's main weakness is its structure which can be a bit confusing, additionally there are just so many characters, you end up losing interest in its main protagonist which defeats the purpose of the book.Also, Anne Rice's language is repetitive and simplistic, a far cry from the poeticisms of her Lestat books.And finally, the saccharine wide-eyed tone of the book can become too much.Disappointing"
3,"Great story, but...",The story was great as I would expect from Anne Rice. Her historical research is amazing. The only down side of this audiobook was the reader. His voice was a bit whiny and unpleasant. The sequel had a different reader that was much better.
4,First person problem for reader,"I had a problem with accepting the writer's use of first person for Jesus Christ. Otherwise, I enjoyed the book. It is really up to each individual reader to accept the writer's point of view. I don't mean for my comment to be a criticism."
2,Controversial,"I had my reservations and even felt 'sinful' while reading about Jesus in the first person. The book had me waiting for the big event to happen and it never did. It was a written account of the mind of child Jesus trying to come to terms with who He was.Controversial piece as nothing has been found from these 'dark years'. The author tempts the reader with names of Biblical personalities in a historically-correct setting making the reader's mind wander and trying to connect the dots. I would not give it an A+ because the structure of the book fails to create momentum. It did, however, bring peace as my mind wandered into known passages of the Christian Bible.From a Christian point of view, there were some assumptions that can lead to confussion for those who do not study the Bible regularly. James and his origin is probably one that would be considered risky, and Joseph's weakness in facing child Jesus. It is after all fiction."
1,Boring,"Fell asleep everytime I tried to read more pages. One of the few book I am not going to finish reading. And I paid full price for it, several years back, at a Barnes and Noble."
2,80386,"Good book as a reference , but these days they teach PIC not intel so you may conside look for a book on PIC"
3,okay but i expected more,The instructions and projects are certainly good but for the price I expected an actual book not a thin flimsy booklet.
2,"Solder Magic , I Don't Think So","The ""information"" contained in this book could be condensed into one or two paragraphs. There's much better instructional resources on-line"
2,hand warmer,"The hand warmer works but only for a short time (maybe a half hour). And, shipping took much too long. It was during Christmas time which always slows the mail, but it still took longer than it should, in my opinion."
2,Lay the Sax Down and Put Your Hands Up!,"I no longer have this CD. That in itself should tell you something. I've heard good things from this group so if you're new to them don't write them off entirely. The Sax playing on this album was very distracting and prevented me from getting into the groove. (when I found it.) Yes, Jazz is great! Between the improve and odd time signatures it's something that a real musician or simply a ""musician at heart"" can really get into. I just didn't see the point in keeping this album when I've found much tighter playing elsewhere. Sorry guys! You're good musicians but it just wasn't moving me on this one."
5,"As Always, the best","Sweet Honey delivers message of love, struggle and social resonsibility through their rich, stirring a capella vocals, and celebrate 30 years together with this new CD. This one presents a wide range of styles and vocalizations of mostly contemporary songs written by the group, or new arrangements of old songs, such as Isaac Watts' ""That Awful Day Will Surely Come."" They address everything from addition to voter rights (or lack thereof) in the District of Columbia. A lush and thought-provoking CD as only Sweet Honey can create."
4,LOVE THIS,I Love these women. There are powerful messages in this album and their sound is amazing. I would encourage others to get this for sure. If you are concerned about our world and enjoy good a cappella music you will enjoy.
1,Poor quality,"Leaked all over the place when I first attached it to my hose, then cracked. I wouldn't buy this model again."
2,Worked fine for 6 months,"This device worked fine with the following: VUDU movie box, TiVo Series 3, Sony DVD player. Yesterday, however, on the 6 month anniversary, it stopped working altogether. No amount of power recycling, button pushing will bring it back to life :("
1,this switcher sucks,I bought this switcher so I could put all of my equipment on my single HDMI TV input. All of the equipment worked great except for the PS3. I looked on the intertubes and found out that the switcher uses an older HDMI standard the PS3 will not except. sucks.........
1,Broken within two days,"I had the same problem with this hdmi switcher. Worked fine the first day but turned it on the second day, and only one port worked. Very frustrating. Would definitely NOT recommend."
1,At least it worked occasionally for a few months...,"This device was easy to hook up. I noticed that it took a few tries to get the ""channel"" to register, but I was lazy and didn't return the switcher, and the problem became worse over time. It worked for me for the first four or five months, then stopped working entirely. While my switcher worked during August and most of September in 2009, it often took ten or more button pushes to get the correct ""channel"" (1 through 4). I'm not bothering to spend time getting it fixed or replaced, nor will I buy another product from this company."
1,Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews,"I chose this model over some of the cheaper ones because it had a lot of positive reviews in addition to the negatives. I should have looked at all the negatives. It worked for less than 5 minutes before every input but number 4 blew out. I'm no better off than I was before this piece of garbage. It's going back, and I'm going to try a different manufacturer."
1,Don't buy this one,"I bought this switch last November. Last month, it stopped working, wouldn't power up. With a one year warranty, I contacted their technical support and, 3 weeks later, I received a replacement. The only problem? The replacement didn't work either. I'm not trying for a third...I'd rather have one that works."
1,Two duds in a row!,"I just purchased this product - it arrived but would not power up. Amazon very quickly sent a replacement, but it had the same problem. Very disappointing since I have other Xtreme products that are fantastic. Two dead units in a row does not inspire confidence about Xtreme's quality control. Trying Oppo next...."
5,Love it Love it!,I've had this for two years now and it's still going strong. An HDMI switcher is a must have in any household and this brand is modern looking and the build quality is great.
3,Looks can be deceiving ...,"I've owned this HDMI Switch for 5 years now and it just stopped working this weekend. I had my HDTV, DVD Player, BR-Player, and Media center connected to it. I have always kept this unit on top of all my other components with sufficient ventilation space between everything. During this time, I've had to tie the cables a specific way to make sure they won't move because the connection would drop if they were touched. Pretty sure my cables were not bad because it would only happen on the connection side into this switch. The video quality was good, The Sound Quality was a bit quieter compared to just plugging into my Receiver. Anyways, it served its purpose through these years, now looking for a new and different one."
1,Apple TV Problems with Switcher,"I bought the Apple TV and the XtremeMac HDMI switcher. I have been unable to get the Apple TV to work through the switcher. After calling Xtreme's support number and double checking settings, cables etc. I find out that although they claim this device was made for the Apple TV it does not work with some units. After searching the internet for problem with this combination I found that I am not alone, there are a lot of unhappy buyers out there.(note: Extreme mac does not have the usual support forum or faq that most sites have, I think that is intentional to try and keep this problem quiet)I have a new Sony TV, Apple TV, top quality cables, followed all troubleshooting advice. The switcher works fine with my xbox 360 elite, my DVD player and my Dishnet receiver. Just not with the Apple TV. The Apple TV works fine when connected directly to the TV.Buyer Beware, when used with Apple TV this product may or may not work."
2,Didn't pass PS3 through in 1080P,"The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it looks decent and worked with things under 1080p.I plugged in my PS3 into every input port in the back and the TV would not recognize is in 1080p. The only time I could pass through the signal is if I set the PS3 to pass through in 1080i.Just to make sure, I plugged the PS3 directly into the same HDMI port on the TV as I was plugging the switcher into, and it would recognize the signal in 1080p, so I know it's not the TV. Plus, I just got a new Samsung PN58A650.Anyway, I called XTremeMac support and they told me that recently there have been problems with the TV recognizing the switcher between the items you are plugging into it and the TV, so that is causing the problem. I don't know why that would cause the problem, but I guess the switcher should be unrecognizable to the TV according to them, and it doesn't do that in the latest batch of these switchers.[...]Good luck to everyone."
3,ok,Works great but a lot of times it doesnt respond to power on/off you have to unplug and replug from power outlet and it starts working.....
3,Not compatible with 1.3a?,"I don't think this is compatible with HDMI 1.3a. I replaced some of my home theater with newer units, and this didn't support it. Try the Psyclone PSC47."
2,Did not Deliver!,Bought this off of Amazon which in the past has served me well. I bought the ExtremHD to hook up my PS3 and X-box360 Elite through the one HDMI input my older TV has.The images ended up being degraded and/or pixelated.As far as I'm concerned this kind of product should work right out of the box and it did'nt.The other rip off that happend to me was that I paid about $120 for this junk and now it's price is half of that. Probable because of reviews like this one!
1,What an awful product.....,"I bought this device for its aesthetics alone; it matched my appletv. Unfortunately, unlike cheaper boxes, it doesn't work with AppleTV alongside a Samsung TV.After a month of frustration, plugging and unplugging the AppleTV directly into the TV, the XtremeHD box just stopped working, no lights, no response to the remote, nothing.Contacting XtremeMac has yielded nothing.This is a serious piece of junk. Beware shoppers, it may look pretty, but it is ugly inside."
1,Poor tech support,"The items looks pretty, and matches the Apple TV, and for the most part works as described. I have 4 HDMI inputs, (Blu-Ray Player, Sat. TV, regular DVD player, and the Apple TV. The only item that does not work with the switcher is the Apple TV device! It works fine when plugged directly into the TVs HDMI input, but nothing when plugged into this unit. Have tried switching cables, and switching positions. Everything works BUT the Apple TV (which was the point of the purchase really!)Sad part is that when contacting their tech support people by email - the first email was ignored! The resend (marked as such very obviously) was replied to but with a stupid question which proved they had not read my email (perhaps an auto reply). Still have had no response at all from the reply to their reply! Three weeks now.Buyers should be aware and beware of poor support."
3,DOES NOT INCLUDE HDMI CABLES,Do not be fooled - this product does not include any HDMI cables despite what it says in the product description. Xtrememac does not even include them when you buy it directly from them.
1,Does NOT work with Apple TV + Syntax Olevia TV,"For their price/features ratio the Syntax Olevia TVs are widely sold, also at Amazon. I have a recent 26"" model to which the Apple TV has been connected for a flawless performance. Upon purchasing a Toshiba HD-DVD I also picked up the Extrememac HDMI switcher, since the company seems to sleep in the same bed as Apple, with the unit having the same form factor as the Apple TV, and the company delivering affordable cables for the Apple TV via Apple. So my expectations were not too high to expect the Apple TV to work with the Extrememac switcher.After being unable to get the Apple TV to work with the switcher (advertised specifically as ""Works with Apple TV"") I am now in receipt of a Extrememac support email stating that not all TVs work with the switcher. Major bummer, and I chide the company for not disclosing which brands fail to hook up. After all, the thing's a $99. paperweight otherwise. Buyer beware!"
3,Does not work with Comcast's Motorola dvr box,"very nice design, really sleek and sharp looking however it does not work with Comcast's Motorola dvr high def box. it works great however with ps3."
1,DOA Did Not Power up out of the box,DOA product did not power up out of the box. Can't say much more than that.
1,Bart Simpson Mask,"This mask is very difficult to wear for more than a minute as it is a very tight fit, you feel like you're suffocating and you can't really see well through the eye openings."
4,Needed help.,When I received these clippers I noticed that the bottom jaw was not lined up with the top jaw.The bottom jaw had a groove in it's middle where the top blade was supposed to hit; as a result they did not cut well. I put the bottom jaw in a vice and bent it to mesh with the top blade and it worked well. This was probably an infrequent mistake but if a person didn't have a vice to fix them with they would have been returned.
2,Works for a season,"I have a very small garden. These were used to trim back roses.They work(ed) well, however, after just one season's use they need significant sharpening. This is so even though they were only used to cute green growth."
2,the second worst in the series,I HATED the ending of this movie. You find out that the murderer isn't Jason. It's some guy pretending to be him. And that's just the beginning of the end. Let's just say the second half of the end doesn't make any sense. This is the second worst in the series in my opinion (the worst being part 8). If you decide to buy it don't expect anything great.
1,WHERE'S JASON?,"ALOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO ARGUE THAT THIS MOVIE ISN'T THAT BAD. WELL, I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE SERIES AND I OWN EVERY ENTRY IN THE SERIES, THIS IS THE WORST. JASON ISN'T IN IT FIRST OF ALL, AND THE KILLER THAT TAKES HIS PLACE IS JUST A BAD CHARACTER AND VERY UNDEFINED. (ROY) THE GORE AND BODY COUNT ARE PRETTY GOOD, BUT THE MOVIE OVERALL IS DEFINITELY FOR DIE-HARD FANS ONLY. IT GETS MUCH MORE CREDIT THAN IT DESERVES, IN THE WHOLE SERIES ITS #9."
1,"Why Wes, Why?","Oh sure, now Wes Craven gets back into Friday the 13th! It didn't need another sequel! The last movie left no possible opening for a sequel and yet they made one. It sucks. Why can't they just let a good series end?"
2,AH!,A movie sequal that had a pretty nice idea to it but falls way short of what could of been. Could of had better acting and script.
4,Not so bad at least Tommy Jarvis was in it,Before I saw this movie I already knew Jason wasn't going to be in it. If I hadn't I would've have realized it until I saw the Jason imitator had two eyes. Jason's face has always changed but he's always had only one eye. I thought it was weird how he could get hit by a tractor and have his arm sliced and still be able to fight. I understood his motive but he should've taken his kid out of the pyscho home. Tommy Jarvis probably said less than ten words the entire movie. Jason was in it in a dream that Tommy had. The murder was the same as always but I liked it. It wasn't a bad movie but they're all the same. If you've seen one you've seen them all.
4,Awsome movie but..........,"Tommy, the freaked out by JASON boy goes to some mental camp where JASON starts another killing spree.There wasn't as much killing in this one compard to the other FT13s.JASON dies at the end falling on this thing that must stor hay. THIS MOVIE IS RATED R FOR BlOOD AND GORE VIOLENCE,AND A SCENE OF SEXUALITY.The reason I gave it 4 stars was it was a little slow pace."
2,Terrible...But Not the Worst In the Series,"This movie should be skipped over. You don't even need to watch it to further your understanding of Jason Voorhies or the character of Tommy. It's over the top hilarious and the acting is so bad you'll want to throw your TV out the window.The only thins that I do like about the movie are the Tommy scenes where he's beating up people, and the scenes of the hilbilly mother and son. Otherwise, definitely skip."
4,Many hate this film yet its one of my favorites!,friday the 13th part 5 has always been the black sheep of the series because of roy the paramedic (imposter jason) the deluxe dvd really brings this film to justice with commentary's and interviews on the dvd.
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:While I applaud the movie's willingness to try something different (*major spoiler* Jason isn't the killer in this one) the fact remains that Part V has so many things terribly wrong with it--including but not limited to terrible acting and awful writing--that I can't come close to recommending it to anyone besides diehard ""Friday"" fans."
3,A Disappointing Beginning...,"I bet when this was released, it pissed off a lot of Jason fans. It should have been obvious when Roy looks mad when Joey died, because Jason just appears out of nowhere! The gore scenes are pretty cool. The Jason mask was different with blue stripes. If you want a good Jason movie, try another one in the series, but if you desperately want to watch it, you might like the new beginning..."
3,"Part 5 The New Beginning, Weak but still worth your time!","I actually liked part 5. Most people seem to dislike it. Dont want to give away the story or plot details but after the first 4 films they had to give a different spin on things for atleast one film.Pros+Good storyline+Good ideas+Attractive cast+Many many kills!Cons-once you have watched it once, dont really have much to re watch. once the plot is given away.Its a fun ride, if you have seen the other films. Dont skip it if you havent seen it."
4,A New Beginning is not that bad,"I like Friday the 13th part 5 but I don't think that part 5 is the best Friday the 13th.Yes,Jason is not the killer in this one but that does not make this a bad movie.Friday the 13th part 5 is just as fun to watch as the other Friday the 13th movies.When I first watched part 5 I did not like it very much.But now I have seen part 5 about 20 times and I love it.Friday the 13th part 5 gets better the more times that you watch it.Jason is in this movie but he is not the killer.But all of Jason's scenes are a dream.Look at Halloween 3.Michael Myers is not seen or even talked about in Halloween 3.Friday the 13th part 5 could have been a lot worse.The kills in Friday the 13th part 5 are really good and the movie is funny and fun to watch.Part 5 also has some hot girls in it.Just give Friday the 13th part 5 a chance.It is really not as bad as people say."
3,A New Beginning,"When watch the opening of the film I thought Jason will come being zombie.When I understand that murderer isnt Jason become quite dissapointed but liked the movie muchI think part 2 was the scariest in 4 sequels but when I watch this this movie become second scariest in 5 sequels.Best musics and very scary ""boo"" scenes make you feel terrified.You dont understand that murderer isnt Jason so you think hes jason.The story is very good I think but not continuing the part 4.Acting is still awesome.Movie dont have any silly scenes.I reccomend this movie to all ""Horror Movie and Friday the 13th fans"" Highly Jason fans will be dissapointed at the end of the movieMovies still good and directed well get your copy quickly.And wait for part 6"
2,Not exactly one of the best in the series.,"A forgetable part in the Friday the 13th series. And Jason is not the killer in this film. The only fun scene is the one where one of the girls at the bedlam dance the robotdance in her room. Ahh, the wonderful 80's."
2,"NOT TO BAD FILM, DISSAPOINTING ENDING","THIS FILM IS NOT TOO BAD, IT CONTAINS IT'S GOOD FUN, BUT BY THE TIME YOU FIND OUT THAT THE KILLER IS NOT JASON YOU ARE DISSAPOINTED. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY MADE THIS ENDING, BUT THE FILM IS NOT TO BE PASSED."
1,"No Jason,No GOOD!",Oh Come on what were the people smoking when they made this movie how could you make a Jason movie without Jason worst one since the first one like i said No Jason No Good watch part six thats the coolest but do yourself a favor forget this one.
2,3 stars JUST for the story line.,"An interesting story line but copuld have expanded a little more. Some kills have a serve up of blood but some are REALLY cheesy. For some fans the fact that there are alot of girl's breasts in this is a good thing. For some fans they don't really care. Either way, this film is loaded with blood and sex and if you like that stuff you will LOVE this film. There is alot of sick humor in this too and the Really and Almost only funny kill in this is when a guy gets his head hacked off as he was riding on a motor cycle, LOL! Either way there is still a little light and some gopod scenes for this gore fest! Warning: This definatley deserved a R rating! Happy watching!"
2,Yawn!,"Apart from the fact that the killer wasn't actually Jason, this film follows the same old routine as all the others. I know there are some people who actually like these movies, but this one is not for you. If you are not a fan of the series, then you should definitely avoid, along with all the others!"
2,Can things get any worse?,"Time has passed since Tommy killed Jason in self defence 10 years ago. Now an adult Tommy still has fears of the evil monster coming back to haunt him. in a mental institution Tommy is battling every day to get over his horrific ordeal that happened so long ago. Suddenly, one of the inmates is brutally murdered. As the bodies pile up, police are baffled. Tommy has one theory- that Jason is back once more. No one will believe him.. Jason is dead though, isn't he? Well for my sake he better stay dead after this desperate horrible sequel. But it deserves 2 stars the acting is a little more credible which is reason enough to give it an extra star."
3,Better than part 4...,"I didn't like ""The Final Chapter"" all that much and although I thought that it couldn't get any gorier - it did. Although it tries to be a mystery, you can tell who it is early on. Not all that much suspense, yet it still delivers quite a few surprises. It's different though, and this series needed a change of pace. It returned to Jason after this one, which I hear made the fans really happy at the time. I dunno, it's okay. I like the first three in the series the most. They're great for parties. The first is a comedy - not a horror movie. You'll laugh out loud!This one is for avid Jason fans... or those who just want to be entertained."
2,Your unlucky day,"One of the characters from part IV is now in a madhouse when, just as luck would have it, another vengeful serial killer strikes. Brings some of the good qualities from the first two back but is too lame to be THAT entertaining. Locatell is funny as hell as the foul-mouthed Ethel."
4,Them were the days...,I remember this movie scaring the p*ss out of me when I was 10 years old. I made the mistake of letting my friend talk me into seeing it in the theater with him and his mom. I had nightmares for weeks. Pretty damn laughable now. I give it four stars for the memories alone.
3,Did Jason really die in part 4?,"Yes Jason did die, but the killer in this one is a imposter of Jason"
2,Unfortunate Release,"Basically the problem with this ""deluxe edition"" release is that there's not much ""deluxe"" about it. I was pretty excited when I first heard about a ""deluxe edition"" part 5 being released. Unfortunately for me the extras that were on the workprint release of this same film weren't included. There are some deaths scenes in this film that you actually never get to see. However, these deaths scenes are on the workprint. I just think that if they wanted to release this movie yet again, they should have made it worthwhile by including the extras. It's kind of like when you buy Goonies on DVD and you dont get the extra scenes of the octopus battle and when Troy steals the map from them. I mean why bother? Save your money...because you get no extra death scenes. It's not much different than any other release of ""A New Beginning"". I'm very dissatisfied with this release."
4,Good Movie,"Every time you watch a Friday the 13th movie, they get better and better except for part 8, Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X. This is the second best in the series behind 2, which features scantily clad women in revealing clothing or nude for a good part of it. Jason is maniacal as the lead character, an unctoppable killer who finally meets his demise like in Friday movie, only to return for 11 sequels. The acting is belivable and they weren't wearing totally 80s clothes. What I liked about it was the realism of the plot and acting, absent from more revered Hollywood cinema. Watch it and be prepared to not be scared as you root for Jason in this violent movie. I loved it."
2,How stupid...,"This F13 has to be the worst, and that's coming from a die hard F13 fan. First of all, it's not even really Jason in this film. It's some posing psycho that puts on the mask and slaughters a few kids. What really made this film stupid, is how the murder scenes were directed. Most of the teenagers died at the same time!The only part that was really cool was when an unexpected, beat up hill billy was decapitated while in motion. I guess that scene was to make the audience gasp. Obviously they needed something to attract the audience from death of boredom.I hate to critize an F13 film, but this one was just terrible. Save your money, and don't buy this one. Two stars at the most."
3,what a campfest.,"Jason is not the killer.Ok, I loughed so hard at this film. Standout campfest. Bad acting, 22 deaths, the f word used in a way that i have never heard befor or since in a horror film. I laughed so har at this movie that my stomache stil hurts. I don't watch this film series for the intelligence of the scripts or acting but to be entertained. I waS in spades. I also washed my mouth out with soap."
2,Why they made this one if jason is not on it,"This one sucked i mean the movie was good but if they gonna put Jason on it instead of some dude thats acting like him they shoudnt made the movie.You could tell that wasnt Jason the mans size, Jason is like built this dude was skinny.This was the worst one out of the whole series."
1,The series stoops to an all new low,"After the undeniable success of part 4, It was decided that there would be a part 5 in the series [Despite the fact that part 4 originally promised to be ''The Final Chapter'']. Tommy Jarvis, Now haunted by nightmares about Jason, is now being sent to a place for troubled teens when all of a sudden, A copy-cat killer emerges and begins killing off everyone in town. Believe it or not, This could've worked. But, It was all executed wrong. The imitator here is far less thrilling than Jason and the murders are all unoriginal and without any merit. The real Jason does have a cameo appearance in a dream sequence at the beginning of this movie, And when i find out that that's the only time the real Jason will be in this movie, I all of a sudden wish that the copy-cat would somehow run into the real Jason in the movie and get killed by the real Jason. This is low movie-making that fails on all categories."
1,Whats good about this entry in the Friday the 13th saga,For the DVD they gave the box new cover art. Thats the best thing about this whole DVD nuff said!!!
3,The oddball of the Friday the 13th movies,"I had heard that this one was supposedly so hated by people that it got booed at movie theatres and stuff. Either way, I was going to watch it anyway. Afterwards.......I...I don't know. I mean, its not like I hated it or anything, it had it's moments. But I am not going to say its my favorite or anything. And the way it ended was...well, lets just say that I did not care much for that, and it was probably the wierdest part of the film. All i can say is, give it a try, and see if YOU like it or not. For me, it was okay.The End. x"
3,Ok..........................................,"This was good but it made me so mad when you found out that Jason wasn't the killer! And the ending was so stupid! I mean why does the nice guy, Tommy take the mask an is about to kill the girl? (It was Tommy in the mask at the end, wasn't it)? Because of all that I'd drop this one down 2 points. The killings were great though. Make sure this isn't the first Friday the 13th movie you watch or you'll be so confused! AS WAS I!!! This deserves 3 stars."
2,"Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning","Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning is the worst in the series so far and that is saying allot. The acting is much worst then in prior movies. The script is awful like on a police academy parts 4 and onwards level. The special effects looked cheap even for the time the movie was made and the budget is like nothing close to the first couple of movie. The music is outrageously bad and is probably some of the worst 80's music I have ever heard. I love the 80's hairdos, the tacky cheap looking clothes, and the make up is atrocious.The dialog is so bad that one wonders if it is a high-school project gone awry. The killing scenes are also kind of lame and they seem to have run out of ideas. The movie is only 92 minutes long but it sure feels it is like at least twice as long and the plot makes no sense at all. This is a movie that has no redeeming qualities and should be avoided at all costs."
4,"Jason's back with a new story, so kick back and watch him!","Now, now what did I Tell you? This movie left off where the final chapter did. The little boy slaughtered him until he died.Then after years pass, the boy gets older. Then has a dream that2 men with a machette dug up Jason's body. Then he comes to life and kills them. And head straight for the little boy. Then all ofa sudden murders go on. I guess his dream came true!"
3,Doesn't compare to the rest of the films,"A now teenage Tommy Jarvis is institutionalized for his mental problems due to the events in the previous installment, ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"". Soon after his arrival, people around Tommy starts dropping like flies--someone is murdering people using Jason's killing style... Is Jason back to finish him off?To me, this is the second worse film in the ""Friday the 13th"" series. The death count is too high, preventing a good plot from developing. The only good thing about this movie is the performance of John Shepherd as Tommy Jarvis. Fans of Jason Voorhees might be disappointed at the film's ending."
2,"One of the worst ""Jason"" movies ever made!","I don't know why I said this was one of the worst ""Jason"" movies ever made because you know what, Jason wasn't even in this movie! That was a huge dissapointment. This is just about some guy who keeps on having flashbacks of when he was a kid, he saw Jason actually come out of his grave and slaughter the people that dug him out. He goes away to a camp where they can try to help him with these problems he is having. In his time there many things happen, yeah you know killings! But the worst part is Jason isn't the one doing any of them. It's just a man in a costume, I will leave it to you to figure out who it is. The only thing I liked about this film was the beginning."
3,Average slasher movie can't be saved by DVD release,"If the VHS sucked, than so does the DVD. Paramount has once again decided not to release any new extras other than a trailer on the new DVD. FRIDAY THE 13TH: NEW BEGINNING is an average slasher movie that has ALL the stereotypes one might expect. But surprisingly enough, it's fun to watch on that level alone. This movie is for die hard slasher fans only, who like movies with no plot and trashy teenagers who only have sex on the mind. NEW BEGINNING was a let down to fans after a very good FINAL CHAPTER, but luckily the studio made up for it with JASON LIVES. Now if only Paramount would realize that they could actually make NEW BEGINNING more appealing if they released the director's cut with all the extra gore and some type of ""making-of"" documentary. The FRIDAY movies have loads and loads of goodies out there, but the studio has yet to let them see the light of day."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I thought the original ""Friday the 13th"" was bad, but ""Part 5--A New Beginning"" is even worse. The movie starts off promising with Corey Feldman and the real Jason making cameos, but the body count in this movie was WAY too high (7 people die in the first half hour), the teenagers are even stupider than before, the humor is unfunny, and there is just too much female nudity. Plus, I found out who the killer was right away involving one particular scene when the sheriff says, ""What maniac could've done this?"" Overall, this horror flick was just plain awful and makes the other ""F13"" movies look like ""Citizen Kane"" in comparison."
1,HELP ME!,This is pitiful. The first one was good. The second and third were dreadful. The fourth started to show an improvement in the series. The fifth is just sad.
1,Good Idea - - - just terrible execution,"I was happy to see that they werent gonna make the same film 4 times in a row after the previous sequels, and i thought having a copy-killer would be a good idea, but this movie was just horrible."
1,A fake.. Total disrespect for the viewer...,"Ok, we could understand the idea of someone impersonating Jason...... But doing he same things that Jason does, with THE SAME FORCE was a total disrespect and utterly dishonest to the audience. Jason can take the damage he does and kill with the power he does because he is SUPERNATURAL!! The human who replaced him could not have done half the things he did. Simple as that. I remember the feeling of betrayal I had after watching this movie..."
2,"Oooh baby, ooh ooh baby","Definatly not the best Friday the 13th. But some parts in this movie are so bad, they are very enjoyable. If you like old horror films, i recommend it. But see the first ones first."
2,"Not again! Well, sort of.","Okay, despite what Paramount told you after the last movie, we get yet another Friday the 13th. Jason is dead but that doesn't keep a Jason impersonator from murdering a bunch of morons at a halfway house.The film opens with a cool dream sequence featuring Corey Feldman but quickly falls into a lame revenge tale that really makes no sense at all. The opening and closing fifteen minutes are pretty good but the rest of the movie is just a mess."
3,"Not the best Friday, but not bad either.","Although this is a fun installment of the Friday series, parts 1,2,4 and 7 were better. (know the fact that I only consider parts 1-8 part of the series because the rest [are bad]) 5 takes place in a home with teens who have problems at home and teens with small disabilities or problems. Tommy Jarvis is going there to recooperate from the trauma he experienced as a boy from part 4: the final Friday??? Anyway, this is pretty decent. DVD features aren't all that but there is a great transfer and it's wide screen. Overall DVD grades:MOVIE: CIMAGE: ASOUND: B-EXTRAS:D+OVERALL AVERAGE: C+"
3,One of the best installments from those that i have seen...,"This one has a killer, with a hockey mask, but it isn't Jason. Mystery and a couple of suspense moments are in this installment. Why is this better then most of the previous entries? I'll admit, part 1 and Jason X were better but part 5 takes a new route, and the big chasing is very ""finale""-ish. The end is creepy, can't wait to see parts 6 and 4 now. Overall, a bad series, but part 5 was actually one of the best to me. it was different. See it, it isn't that scary, but it is very entertaining and you won't believe which character the killer is!"
2,Awful.,"The makers promised that they wouldn't do another ""Friday the 13th"" after ""...The Final Chapter"", but here they are again, and they spoiled it! More violence, the story is confusing & badly acted."
4,Jason strikes again?,"Tommy Jarvis, who killed Jason as a young boy, has been in a psychiatric clinic ever since, is still haunted by halucinations and nightmares involving the killer he put a stop to.When he is brought to a halfway house in the countryside, nearby killings start up again.Alright, so this is another Jason film, but it is made entertaining due to its humour, interesting characters, and strong direction. If it does have a down side, it's that the direction is often heavy-handed rather than strong. The truth behind this episode's 'Jason', for example, should have stayed a secret until the ending. Instead, it's given away far too early. Still, this is one of the series' better entries."
2,IT'S BEGINNING TO GET OLD NOW,"THIS SEQUEL IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE 1ST 4. IN THIS ONE, A MASKED MURDERER GOES ON A KILLING SPREE IN A SMALL TOWN. PLEASE NOTE THAT JASON ONLY APPEARS IN THE OPENING SCENE, FROM THERE, THE KILLER IS NOT JASON, BUT AN IMITATOR WITH THE SAME MOTIVE. THE STORY IS PRETTY WEAK AND THIS IS JUST MORE OF THE SAME STUFF THAT IS SEEN IN FRIDAY THE 13TH 1-4. THE TOMMY JARVIS CHARACTER IS THE ONLY THING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE LAST ONE. THE SERIES WAS BEGINNING TO REALLY SHOW THAT THIS SERIES NEEDS TO BE STOPPED, BUT, THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO KNOW THE WORD STOP, DO THEY?"
1,What the hell is this?,"Why did they do this? The only reason I bought it is because it is part of the series. If you just like movies for the killing then you would probably like it. Just the fact that A person imitated Jason, man tnat sucked."
4,A Pretty Disappointing Beginning!!!,"I bet when this was released, it pissed off a lot of Jason fans, like Halloween III pissed off a lot of Michael fans! I don't hate this one, I just don't like it as well as others! Years after killing Jason Voorhees, Tommy Jarvis is placed in the Pinehurst halfway house. He still suffers hallucinations of Jason. When one of the patients attacks Joey with an axe, a man wearing a hockey mask and a thirst for vengeance shows up killing anyone who gets in his way. If you are a hardcore Jason fan, you might like FRIDAY THE 13TH PART V: A NEW BEGINNING!!!"
5,loved it,jason was so in it i think about the body switching i meaqn come on roy was super strong and srvived the tractor attack the films gore is perfect decapitians throats ripped open someone chopped to pieces tommy was creppy in this one i loved the mental patiants especialy violit pam the main heroine was great and the actress who plaYS HER SAID THAT THE FRIDAY THE 13TH FILMS WERE SOME OF THE BEST HORRO MOVIES EVER AND WOULD DO ANOTHER I LOVE THE MUSIC TO THE HIS EYES SONG WAS GREAT AND OFFERED MORE SUSPENSE THE NEW MASK IS DIFFERENT IT HAS BLUE HOLES INSTEAD OF RED BUT A MUST SEE
1,"Wow, this one was horrendous...","As a fan of the 70's/80's horror genre, I thought that Friday the 13th part 5 was the worst installment of the series and quite possibly the worst horror film ever made...all this movie features is dumb people getting killed...the plot (if you can ever say that any of these flicks have plots) is pathetic; there is no Jason Voorhees as we know him...do yourself and others around you a favor...don't watch this movie; watch all of them except 5 and Manhatten...better yet, if you like F13th flicks, rent Halloween 1, 2, and 4...they're a helluva lot better, with more of a plot, more suspense, better music (not to knock Harry Manfredini of F13th fame), and less of the ""cut em up/create all the needless gore anyone could want"" style of slaying."
2,Friday the 13th Part 5 A New Beginning,"If Jason still haunts you, you're not alone!This movie sucks. I am not even gonna waste my time reviewing it. It sucks because Jason is not even the killer. This is the worst in the series. The dvd has no real featuresThis movie is presented in a widescreen presentation."
4,A Fake Jason!,"Yes, it's not Jason who's killing all this kids (22 actually), but he has a hockey-mask, and you don't know that it's not Jason untill the end. Tommy Jarvis has been moved into the woods, for mental care, together with a group of kids. Then, as always, the killings start, a lot of nudity, a little bit of humor, and a lot of creative murders. So who cares if it's not Jason, as long as we got the gore! And I have to give credit to the storywriter, who's trying to give the series a twist. The movie is actually one of the best in the series."
3,A HOOT,"This is one of those ""horror"" films that succeeds only in being a comedy. The funniest person is ""Ethel,"" the foul-mouthed farm woman who calls her moronic son a ""big dildo"" and a f@#kwad."" Close behind is ""Demon,"" who meets his unfortunate end in the ""sh@#box"" after purging ""them damn enchiladas."" The plot revolves around some teens in a halfway house who are half wits. The acting is terrible, the action fake, and yet Jason rides again !!!"
3,Gruesome...,"""Friday the 13th V:The New Beginning"". There's no Jason in this (just an imposter). The violence is on overdrive. Not for the squemish or for children. MPAA Rating: R for graphic violence, gore, nudity, sex, drug use and profanity."
3,It doesn't deserve to be shunned,"Many F13th fans ignore this one because the killer isn't Jason, but another burly guy in a hockey mask PRETENDING to be Jason. Despite this huge story change (ha ha) it's pretty good for the series; despite having the most annoying characters ever shown in a horror movie, it manages to be a fair example of blood-and-guts entertainment. END"
4,DON'T LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE... IT'S GOOD,"This movie is GOOD. NOT Jason but looks and acts enough tobelive so. This is a very GORY movie, I wouldn't watch it if you havea weak stomach. Talented funny actors that make you laugh and make you cry. The music is good and the story is good. Well worth the price !!!"
3,a campy entertaing sequel,"the funniest of all the sequels has more nudity and a higher body count than any of the other FRIDAYS. It's the kind of movie that is alot of fun if you don't take it seriously. The only thing that sucks is that the movie was badly chopped up by the MPAA,and was edited down to t.v. level and absolutly no gore survived.HOEFULLY a uncut version will be avalibly and then this movie would rate 4 stars for camp value"
3,why not?,"This film isn't exactly brilliantly acted, but still it's more original than part 3 and 4. when i first watched it i was alittle scared, but i then watched exorcist and texas chainsaw massacre. I have seen all the friday the 13th movies about 5 times each and this and the exellent part6 are the only ones that don't bore me. many people cuss this film for not having jason in it, but i feel that they would cuss it any way no matter how good it is for it being the 5th installment in the series. you may as well buy it for the gore factor, and the watchabillity, good for party's."
2,This Is A Whole New Game,"Tommy Jarvis, the kid who killed Jason Voorhees, is now in a halfway house because, he keeps seeing visions of Jason. Which makes him a nut. This was an okay movie. It wasn't better than the first four, but it was a lot better than Part VIII.A lot of people don't like this, mostly because of the ending. But it made sense of how the killer was back. People who have seen this movie, will know what I mean.I actually would have rated this movie two and a half stars.So if you're the kind of person who likes make-sense horror films, then this one shouldn't bother you too much."
3,As long as you know they're not trying to be Shakespeare...,"Schlock is, at least what I hope it is, entertainment meant to appeal to those who enjoy the lowest level of art. The Friday The 13th series is a part of that schlock... I was raised on movies like this, and because of that, I continue to enjoy them. I am regarded by most people as artsy-fartsy (the actual term used) and I usually require the most intricate characterizations and plot machinations to be pleased. However, with films such as this (essentially, any slasher or really bad horror movie) I can sit back and just laugh hysterically at the workings of the ""characters"". It is not meant to be good -- the filmmakers produce these movies knowing full well that they are ..., and the viewer must understand that. If you walk into this movie knowing that it's junk and all you should be expecting is junk, you should be more open to entertainment... because it is a hilarious little piece of junk!"
4,Maybe the most underrated film in the series,"This movie could have been great. many haven't given it a chance due to poor acting,production, and too many random kills. But it has a good storyline if they had expanded on it. It focuses on tommy, played brilliantly by John Shepard, who can't get Jason out of his mind. Meanwhile a fake jason is on the rampage who is finally killed by tommy. at the end tommy dreams of killing the heroine then wakes up and hides under the jason mask. it is pretty clear this was mean that tommy would be the new killer. if only..."
2,Is Jason back?,"Set several years after the ""Final"" Chapter, an older Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) is sent to a halfway house to deal with his demons after his traumatic experience with Jason as a twelve year old. The other people there start dropping like flies, but director Steinmann gives away his killer's identity way too early in the film. Very routine and unoriginal, and easily the least of the series. Corey Feldman makes a cameo in the opening sequence. The film was written for him, but his commitment to the production of ""The Goonies"" interfered, so he has just one scene here. Good for him. For die hard fans of the series, if they must."
2,"2 1/2, actually","i gave it two and a half because it had some good scares.this one is NOT for jason fans.if your a friday the 13th fan,the only thing good about this movie is that it tells what happened to tommy,from the 4th friday the 13th"
1,It does not work on my creative zen w 30 GB,"It does not work on my Creative Zen W 30 GB. Maybe I got a defective one, although the charger's light turn on when I plug it in, but it just does not charge my device."
2,"charges, but gets hot and interferes with FM transmitter","I purchased this car charger for my road trip from Seattle to Dallas. The charger does charge the Zen. No problem there, though the charger does get hotter than I would like it to.My main gripe is when I am charging my Zen while using my FM transmitter. You end up getting awful interference, ear piercing. It was so bad I would only charge my Zen when stopping to take a break from driving or when getting something to eat. Basically defeats the purpose of using it while on a long road trip."
2,Only theologians need apply,"I know from reviews that this book contains some very important theological ideas that are probably well worth exploring. I also know from his book Atheist Delusions that Hart can write well for the educated general reader. He did not write this book for that audience. Complex ideas are packed in densely with what seems to be little development. Hart assumes the reader already has an extensive background perhaps a doctorate in philosophy or theology. The high(or low) point of this approach are untranslated footnotes in Greek and German. If you are up to that, this is probably an excellent work. If you are not, look elsewhere. I hope Hart has made his important ideas available somewhere in a readable format."
1,Unless you're a total novice: 21 Minutes worth of reading,"I bought this book as previous publications by SAM's have proved to be reasonably good but I was highly disappointed with this one. It would be acceptable if it were titled ""Access 2000: An Overview"" as it does have information that could be useful for absolute beginners. However, as it is severely lacking in depth, I think that it does not come anywhere living up to its title. I got less than 21 minutes worth of reading from the book.Skip it or wait for the Second Edition."
3,Written in a rush,"Access 2000 in 21 days was clearly written by two authors without the necessary care in producing a seamless document. The change in style can be noticed from Day 10 up.The first 9 chapters are fine, but from Day 10 perhaps too much was intended to be written in a puzzled manner. Not worth it!For someone with a serious learning objective the book falls extremelly short. Chapters 16 to 20 are a waste of energy.It is about time for authors and publishers to focus on real teaching instead of going after the big bucks!Paul S. Ferraz, CEO - Dedicated Solutions Inc."
2,Very dispointed with this book,"I usually buy the ""Sams 21 days"" books and am very satisfied with the overall content that they deliver. Usually...This book on Access 2000 is not a good book. It skims on everything and nothing, the examples are not interesting and you don't learn from it. Unless you are really clueless on Access and want to have a very very general picture without knowing why it works, don't buy that book.I will now stop buying Sams' book with my eyes closed. The fact that I had to buy another book (Alison Balter's, great book) angries me even more than the mere fact that I spent 25$ on the Sams' book."
1,"Oh no, this is not worth the time to grope through!","1.This book was written using the beta software. So, often, the screen-shots are different from your display! Very confusing.2.O gosh, the writers (publisher) seemed to have rushed through this book. Mr Cassel & Ms Palmer, give us book buyers a break! We buy with the intention to learn. Not to be left confused and disappointed.3.Honestly, I don't think this book is worth the papers it is printed on. Worst, if you can imagine the many hours unfortunate buyers will have to suffer to try to extract whatever value there is from this book!5. SAMS, please refrain from rushing out such books. One day, you will find that no one will buy your publications for their inferior quality.Sigh! :>("
1,I was disappointed.,"I have used other books in Sam's Teach Yourself series and was satisfied. This disappointing book is likely based on a beta version of the software. I spent a too much time in the software help section looking for ways to do the book's step-by-step examples. My recommendation is wait until they publish an updated and corrected edition.Unfortunately, at this date, the number of ""teach yourself"" Access 2000 books is limited."
4,Good introduction to Access,"I would recommend buying this book if you want to learn whatAccess can do and how to use the tool. I did not buy this bookwith the intent to learn database concepts. All I wanted was anintroduction to the tool and it's capablities.I feel that the book met my objective.Lets face it, you will not become an experiencedMS Access Database programmer in 21 days. To become fullyproficient with this tool, or another DBM, you must havesome knowledge and experience with SQL and other databaseconcepts such as normalization. Microsoft also includesVBA with Access, so you will also want to gain experience withthat. You will also need to learn about ADO.The author does cover all of the topics above, but theexamples often lack a lot of detail and explaination.Just remember that each one of the topics could be the subjectof another book."
1,Missing Important Chapters,"The publisher choose to remove the chapters first introducted in the Access 97 in 21 Days on the fundamentals of database design. This was a BIG mistake. The most persistant problem beginners, the target group, have is correctly designing tables. I did not recommend the teach yourself Access books before the Access 97 in 21 days and it looks like I will not be recommending the most recent addition for Access 2000."
1,Wha?,"Having a strong knowledge of Access, I decided to purchase this book because of its chapters on VBA and SQL. However, I realized after a while that with its unclear instructions and asking me to do things ""if you want to"" or ""maybe you should..."" made me quite unsure of what to do next. Many times I wasn't sure whether it was an instruction or a suggestion to try later.Is the author afraid to give me a clear-cut set of instructions for fear he might offend me? Come on! I'm trying to learn access and I'll be happy to do what you tell me. However, when I'm not sure I'm even given a set of instructions until the next section or the end of the chapter, that's a real problem.I am not pleased with this book AT ALL and wish I hadn't bought it.I recommend you PLEASE check out this author before you purchase his books. I for one am NOT HAPPY with this book!"
1,"Access 2000 in 210 (yes, 210) Days","Fully anticipating to learn the basics of Access 2000, I started reading this book the day it arrived. Having a decent knowledge of database concepts (gained during many painful years of military contract software use - Thanks ULLS-A), I expected to pick up on the topics fairly quickly. After reading the first few chapters, and working through the example database files (that's another story), I was somewhat confused. A lot of information was presented, but not in a thoughtfully organized manner (in my opinion). I had to reread the chapters twice to finally get the concepts straight in my mind. I do not recommend this book for anyone wishing to learn Access 2000 without any prior knowledge or experience with databases and database programs."
2,"Golly, I'm still confused on what Access can do ...","Don't get me wrong, I'm an intermediate programmer with years of experience, but browsing through the pages of this book, I thought I could gain something. Boy, was I wrong ! After chapter five I stopped reading because the topics were not presented in a manner that something will still linger in your mind after browsing through the pages ! Boring is the word . I have read several other 21 days and 14 days books , I thought all sams publications have the same rich content. I regret I spent some of my hard earned money for this book, but in fairness to the author, this book is really for novice programmer with no experience at all , with the intent of entering the database programming world and not for seasoned ones."
5,"If you're just learning, this book is the one for you!",I just started using Access and I was suffering my way through a huge book on Access and not getting anywhere. Then I purchased SAMs Teach Yourself Microsoft Access in 21 Days and I felt like I had the world in my hands. This book is fabulous and it's so well written that you can actually cover three days in the book in one day. It starts out giving you excellent examples of what Access can do and then breaking down the steps. It shows you the logic behind good table technique and gives you great examples of logical thinking and heads-up development. I'm very happy with this book and thankful that I found it. Toni
2,I should've returned this book when I saw read-only files,"When I found that parts of the CDROM were read-only, I emailed the publisher. They emailed me back, saying they were not read-only. Two of the first five databases were unusable, and it took a long time to get past that.I'm now about halfway through the book, and although the book started with some good, in-depth discussions, it has rapidly progressed to manipulations of reports and queries based on tables you don't understand the basis of. I wish we could be building one or more databases from scratch, so I could understand what I've done.Oh, and some of the practice examples are already done, so you can't follow the directions to do them.I can't wait to finish this book, so I can move on to something more useful. It barely touches on most topics, so there'll still be lots to learn before I can make any use of it.I wish I'd gone to Amazon and read reviews, instead of browsing at the bookstore."
1,Very disorganized book,"The examples are HUGE - I have always thought that some straight simple examples would be nice. The very first DB you make really has to be taken off of the CD since it has 8 tables.The book does not really improve after that since the info is very scattered. For instance the FORMS chapters are 5, 10, 14. In between is a ton of other stuff. All of the form examples are HUGE also.I imagine this book will be a nice reference book once I know what I am doing with Access. However with the long examples I found myself short on time to complete them.In this books case, teach yourself in 21 days really means 21 solid 24 hour lessons."
1,I want money back..,"I am a beginner of this program, and after a few hours I just gave up reading this book. Attached CD is read-only, while it tells me to input some data(hmm..can I do that??!). The book talks about some tables which ""are in the CD"", which aren't, no clear single line explanation of what the normalization is (read entire one page worth explanation, and I still don't have a clear idea what the definition is.)etc. Authors' habit of saying, ""if it is necessary,"" ""if you have some time,"" ""if you're familiar with.."" really bugs me.. - what is this? Are they too insecure to give readers an instruction?? I noticed it soon after I started reading the first chapter. I should have looked reviews here before purchasing this book. I have to say I abhor reading this book. I won't get another books from these authors."
5,JoeyknowsLinda,I went to school with India back in the Bronx and it was evident that Linda aka India was destined fror greatness! all her music not limmited to Salsa. Everytime she performs in Orlando I make sure I do not miss it. Her voice is a beautiful in person as it is on record. No special affects there baby it's all her! Buy all her music you will not be disappointed!
3,got better..,"at first I only liked Dicen que yo soy and Lo nuestro w/ Marc Anthony, then after a while I began to like all the songs, they are all special in their own way, can't wait to see her latest."
5,intriguing,"The Sacred Truth... fiction or fact? Intriguing and inspiring, this storyline kept me reading and ultimately wishing the book was much longer. I highly recommend The Sacred Truth it's an engaging interesting read."
3,Beethoven As Performed By ... Whom?,"Who in the world are the musicians performing on this CD? How can any recording company, large or small, release a CD for distribution and sale, and not list the names of the orchestra[s] and conductor[s] involved?"
1,Too small,"The diamonds on this ring were way too small...I got a similar ring at Zales for the same amount, and the diamonds were larger and more brilliant."
4,Helps narrow down the choices,"I liked this book. It is old, and I wish they continued updating it, but I found it very helpful in narrowing down camping choices in the area. They only provide detailed reviews of the very best campgrounds - I guess I would have liked a little more information about some of the other campgrounds. But on the other hand I guess that is what keeps the information from becoming overwhelming. It made it easy for us to plan a trip through Michigan to just research a few of the best campgrounds.The reason I did not give 5 stars was because the layout of the book makes it a little hard to use. All of the maps are in the front, and cities are listed alphabetically, so it means a lot of flipping back and forth to find campgrounds in one general area. I wish they had broken the information down into smaller regional areas with regional maps at the beginning of each section. Then an alphabetized index at the back would have made it easy to look up specific campgrounds."
4,James Dean,"""James Dean: Rebel With A Cause"" is about the life of James Dean. It starts off with the day he died in a car accident at the age of 24 and then rewinds back to the day he was born. It goes through his Indiana roots and his time in California, from his Broadway debut to his star-making role. We knew him as Cal Trask, a unloved son in ""East of East"", Jim Stark, an angst-ridden teen in ""Rebel Without A Cause"", and Jett Rink, the contemporary cowboy in ""Giant"". I liked the book becuase I like learning about new people. The only thing I didn't like was that there were a lot of words I didn't understand. But that didn't stop it from being a good book about an amazing actor."
2,The Pop,"Wow! The ""Blue"" folks make a great microphone, so what a disappointment when I got this product and it appears as if it was not made to work with their microphones. I'm sure that is NOT a true statement, but there is no easy way to connect their pop filter to their desktop microphone. I have the Yeti, which is an amazing mic. Oops! What happened?"
3,"Heavy, poor flex pole, Does NOT work with Blue Yeti USB mic","OK, so you'd figure that this product would work well with the Blue Yeti USB mic.. after all they are made by the same company and this product shows up as a recommended accessory on Amazon for the Blue Yeti USB mic. The trouble is that there is no way to attach it to the mic with what is supplied in the box. I did what many apparently do and used a cordless drill to drill out a new hole in the Yeti mic stand to accommodate the pop filter mount. I find it unfortunate that Blue has not either included a mount with the pop filter for attachment to the Yeti mic, or modified the Yeti mic stand to accommodate the pop filter.Also, in general the flex pole on the pop filter sags under the weight of the pop filter and it is difficult to adjust it upwards to higher positions.The filter itself is well built (perhaps overbuilt, as it is heavy) and performs well. I look forward to many years of use."
1,Unbelievably Disappointing!,"This is a complete let-down! Do not expect this to filter out any ""Pop's!"" It will not. The pop sound and air blast comes through the unit virtually unfiltered! It is a poor mesh screen, and is ineffective. I can not believe Blue Mics, whose other products are top of the line (The Yeti, for example) would sell such a useless item! I immediately repackaged it for return. I do Voice-overs and narrrations. Stick with Musician's Gear double pop filter or the OMNITRONICS EPF-15A Cad Mic Pop Filter and forget this one."
2,False description,"As of Nov 7th, 2012, the product description says: ""The Pop is a universal windscreen for use with any microphone."" Turns out to be false, as it is not mountable at the company's own Yeti USB microphone without extra hardware. Returned."
3,Could not figure out how to attach to my Yeti,"I had read reviews indicating hey had trouble attaching this filter to a Yeti. I thought I had read it had been fixed. Not so. I tried every direction, took off screws, everything I could think of-without success. This and a boom stand were recommended with the purchase of the Yeti mic. Waste of money since they don't work well with the mic. The Yeti is designed to be a tabletop mic (is quite heavy). Then I had to pay postage to return the stand. Live and learn."
2,"Too much design, too little build","Looks great, but the screen is so overbuilt and heavy the gooseneck can't adequately support it. I returned mine."
4,Good Pop Filter,"I rated 4 stars because it lacked support to the Blue Yeti, so i drilled a hole and then it worked!I cant compare to others because this is my first one, but seems like its workin like a charm!"
1,Do not buy with use for yeti blue,"Do not buy with use for yeti blue - it showed up as a suggested add-on. Yet, there is no easy way to attach. More money thrown down the drain."
4,"beautiful with the yeti, but a lil hard to connect! still worth it.",mine came with a little blem on it like a wrinkle in the mesh screen . it's close to the the top so i didn't really care much. it also is very difficult to connect and have it stay on. the back connector wont work unless you fold a piece of paper or fabric around the frame first before clamping the pop filter on it. now it works great and looks great. you can definitely get something as good for much cheaper but it wont be this pretty. looks great on the desk and works as expected. worth it especially if you have a blue mic. Itlooks great my Yeti.
3,Looks like a great product but needs mods to work with Yeti,It really sucks that Blue didnt have the common sense to just put a hole in the stand for us to use this pop filter. Here is a video of someone on YT that did a quick mod that looks the best and very functional.[...]
1,Universal?,"I ordered this pop filter, as it was listed as ""Frequently Bought Together"" when I was purchasing the Blue Yeti microphone. Yeah, that's right, they're made by the same company - but there's no way to attach this ""universal"" pop filter to the Blue Yeti stand that makes Yeti so useful for desktop recording. What a joke - a ""universal"" pop filter that won't even attach to the stand made by the same manufacturer. It's nice quality overall, but that it won't attach to the Yeti unless I remove it from its stand is a non-starter. Yeti buyers beware! I'll definitely be returning this."
1,"looks good, but doesn't filter pops","Sorry, but 1 star. This is a pop filter that doesn't filter pops.I have a Yeti Pro which I love and am an avid Blue Microphone product user, and use this filter; but I can still hear an ample number of p-pops, and s-whistles...It just doesn't work as well as a cheap plastic double filter. I am switching back tomorrow.Yes, this filter looks so much more sophisticated, and it's made of metal, and it's shiny, and brand-matching with the Yeti.....it just doesn't work.The science behind a pop filter is a no brainer, and doesn't involve good looking sophistication -- stick with an $11 plastic one that does the job."
4,Good product for podcasts and more,"I think this is a good product for my Yeti microphone. Many people have said it is hard to adjust and put in place, but I have found that not to be true. You just clamp it to the back and it works just fine."
5,Works Great!,"I bought this to use with my Yeti, and it works great. I was a little worried that it may not be sturdy, because a lot of the other Pop Filters on Amazon seemed to have complaints about them not being able to support their weight. That is not the case with this one. I am glad that I spent the extra few bucks on this one. The only downside is that while the Yeti and this Pop filter are both products of Blue Microphones, this was not specifically made for the Yeti, therefore, there is no actual spot on the Yeti designed for it. I was able to find a spot after watching several online videos, and seeing how other people were attaching it to theirs."
3,Blue Pop Filter,"A recommended addition for any audio recordings to reduce the ssh sounds, but be aware that if installing on the Blue Microphone Yeti, you will need to attach by means other than those included with the filter. I bought knowing this in advance and if you do a YouTube search you will find several different methods and instructions from others on how they attached the filter."
2,Heavy and doesn't stay in place,"The pop filter is heavy and doesn't stay in place when put on the Yeti microphone, which is odd since they are made by the same company."
4,Quality Product,"The pop filter feels like a solid piece of machinery and it does its job well. I do have two minor complaints, though: The first is that the gooseneck support could be a little stronger, although it's certainly adequate if you're not frequently moving the microphone around. The second is that it lacks a proper bracket to fit cleanly with the Blue Yeti microphone. Yes, you can make it work (check YouTube to see how), but it's not the BEST solution. I found a little L-shaped bracket that I attached to the mic stand that works great."
3,Blue Microphone Pop Filter,I had to modify the pop filter mount to get it securely fastened to the Yeti Pro mic. The thumb screw clamp that comes stock with this pop filter is junk. It scratches up microphone base and does not stay securely mounted when adjusting the filter. If you drill the microphone mount to fit the pop filter you can remove the clamp on the end of the flexible extension for the pop filter and screw the flexible extension straight into the drilled hole to make for a much more secure adjustable filter. 3 stars is due to the poor mount design. Other than that the filter works just fine. Performing the modification took 10 extra minutes. Pretty easy fix.
4,Its decent,The pop filter works amazing and is very sturdy.the only thing that bothers me is that i have the blue yeti mic and it took me awhile to get it on.
4,"Very nice, you get what you pay for.","This pop filter is built like a tank compared to those cheap cloth and plastic versions that you get at the discount music stores, so it's a bit more expensive, but the quality and functionality is like night and day. I use it in front of my Shure Beta 58A, and it's absolutely perfect."
2,Bad Design for Yeti,"There seems to be a disconnect in the Blue Microphone company between the accessories and the actual microphone. Not sure how you can claim this is a Universal Pop Filter when there is no way to get it to work on the Yeti without drilling a hole or (like I did) using a twist tie for a seriously poor looking end result. What makes it worse is the company's ""Deal with it"" attitude-like it's cool to be creative. Well, not for me at $30+ bucks. Buy something with a clip and buy it cheaper."
5,The Pop Rocks with the Yeti,"Length:: 1:36 MinsThis is a quick video on how to install this on the YETI Microphone. There have been a lot of videos produced to say that the POP filter doesn't work with the mic, but it does, and the attachment is rock solid for desktop use."
2,Pop Filter Terrible Fit with Blue Yeti Mic,"Length:: 1:57 MinsI ordered this pop filter from Blue assuming it would be a perfect fit for my Blue Yeti mic based on the Amazon recommended ""buy together"" feature. Don't do it! You know what they say when you assume!It's a terrible fit. I can't believe these are made by the same company. I spent several minutes fiddling with the pop filter and no way could I make it fit with the Yeti. I even ended up scratching the Yeti base a bit trying to put this pop filter on.I then came back to the Amazon review page and noticed folks are drilling holes into the Yeti mic stand (yikes) and ordering extra brackets to make it fit. I should have read those reviews before I ordered it.This could be the best pop filter in the world but what good is if I can't attach it to the mic. Amazon should not be recommending this pop filter as an add-on to the Yeti.I've attached a video with my work-around."
2,K filter -- poor bracket,"I have a Blue Yeti microphone and decided to get a pop filter for it. Selecting this one seemed to be a natural choice as it was also from Blue, so it was sure to be a good match. I shocked (shocked I say) to find that the mounting bracket that came with the filter was totally unsuited for the Yeti. After quite a bit of fiddling, I managed to somewhat attach it, although any bump would send it flying. After going back to the Amazon page, I realized that a number of good people had posted pictures of how they had solved this issue. I then ordered a Atlas Sound AD-7B Long Microphone Tube, which seems to have mostly solved the issue. There should somewhere, somehow be better warnings about this, and Blue should really just include a better bracket."
4,Get it back into print...email the publisher!,"I have recently began doing research on my various family trees and since my grandmother's maiden name was Poling, I happen to come across this title through out my research and wanted to know about where to get a copy. I have emailed the publishing company to find out if I could possible obtain a copy of this book and they replied that they would notify me if the book came back into print. I would think that anyone who would like to obtain a copy of this book for genealogy research would start emailing the publisher, McClain Printing Co., at mcclain@mcclainprinting.com and hopefully we will get this book back into print."
4,An Excellent Book for the Serious Reader,"This book is not a light read, but it is an engaging and thoroughly researched evaluation of Thomas Stuart Ferguson's life, career and religious beliefs. Mormon faithful will likely label this text as ""anti-Mormon,"" but an objective reader will sense no rancor in this work. This book is an important read for anyone interested in Book of Mormon studies, and should be kept as a reference on the shelves of minister's studies everywhere."
1,Sad Sack,"I found the book quite a boring retelling of one mans (Thomas Stuart Ferguson) faltering faith. A faith which he based on inaccurate data to begin with. It seems that his faith was about as strong as ... well it wasn't very strong at all it seems ...I was floored to see a man (Dr. Stan Larson) with a PHD from Burmhingham University, writing this kind of book - one would think that there would be much more worth-while topics to not only spend your time, but also your money on. Fortunately I did not have to spend my money on this book - I received it as a complementary copy from the author himself - had the greatest time shredding it - do you know that a really big shredder can gobble nearly 50 pages at a time? That bit of information ranks right up there with the best of what this book has to offer.A dissappointing read."
1,crap,"when i purchased this item, the company who sold it was out of stock. So they shipped me one directly from china. Took a few days and when it got here, everything looked fine, until the install. Bulbs didn't even come close to fitting. After comparing the stock bulbs to the new, there were clear differences. Had to return it."
4,Small but strong,"I tested several times with this oil at the areas where I used to feel muscle cramp, and found out that it really helped.Because of the pretty high price, I give it 4 stars."
2,"Watch out for the ""investing"" word in the title.","As I looked backed through the praises from industry specialists on page 1 of the Book, I felt like the guys weren't totally honest about the strong feats of the Book. 200+pg could be reduced to 30 pages once you filter away repetitive ideas and comliance issues. On investing part, all i saw were those tables with returns, volatility and sharpe ratios. There were some efficient frontiers as well.If you are looking for interesting facts, useful findings on the Funds of funds industry performance, look elsewhere. If you are more or less acquainted with hedge funds and are hungry for refreshing ideas, then skip this book. If you are actually looking for a methodology to screen out a fund of funds manager, you might use it. Even then the author couldn't go further than common sense. Sorry, but this is more of booklet than a book."
4,informative,this is a good book if you are like me and want things explained to you. I love the referencing so I can get a further explanation about the people i am reading about in the bible
5,Like the layout of Haynes,SO in general you have to know a little something about cars to be able to use these books. The main reason I get them is so I have all the torque specs. Please do not just throw bolts on and crank them down. So often you are going from one metal to another and if you just start cranking down on bolts you will damage the softer metal. Like a oil pain to an engine or transmission. The books are well laid out and easy to find what you need. At times it can be confusing because of all the different models an engine may have been put in and the slight differences on how to fix an issue.
2,Not very good,"This book did not really help me for a 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix, they do not show you very detailed information, I would not buy this book if I knew it had this little detail."
2,Hard to use,"I had high hopes for this book, hoping to learn Bengali at home. However, I found the writing style confusing. The pronunciation guide was difficult to follow, leaving me unsure as to how to say the words I was learning. The book forces you to learn the Bengali script, because the second half of the book drops the phonetic English pronunciation and translates Bengali directly to English. I tried to learn the alphabet, but was stymied when I found letters in the script not included in the translated alphabet at the beginning of the book. This would be a good vocabulary book for those who are familiar with Bengali pronunciation and know the alphabet."
1,Not a good learning method. Too many mistakes,"Even though I am still learning Bengali I could easily spot numerous mistakes. They included incorrect spellings and sometimes the wrong word matching the wrong Bengali script.Instead I recommend ""Bengali : A Complete Course for Beginners (Teach Yourself Series)(BOOK & 2 Cassettes) by William Radice"" and ""Lonely Planet Bengali Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Survival Guide)by Bimal Maity."""
1,Learning Bengali,"This book isn't very helpful in learning Bengali. There is no audio aid that helps the person learn proper pronounciation, and audio is very important to learning this language."
1,Gilmour Saw is Dull and Cheap Junk,"Had a Swedish bow saw for 20 years, still sharp as a razor, a pleasure to use. Decided on a backup, went to Ace Hardware. The Gilmour Bow Saw, could hardly cut a 1"" branch. It is made in China and is truly cheap junk. The Ace manager said "" we do not take back used tools."" I only tried it once, how else was I to find out if it was any good. He would not even exchange it. I trusted ACE, they do have a few good products, like paint and plumbing. This saw is an embarassment. Get a Swedish steel blade on a BAHCO or others. USAF Retired. Technology Teacher 37 years."
2,Boring & kinda stupid.,"When I heard a new G.I. Joe series was coming, I was thrilled. I really liked the classic show & knew this one would be better animated, more realistic but just as fun.Well, I was partially right.I'm not sure what the problem with the series is exactly. Is it the bland animation? Is it the lack of the classic designs? Is it the fact that these bland characters are nothing like their classic (and charismatic) counterparts (Zartan & the Dreadnok being the worst examples)? All those things contribute to the problem but the simple fact is...this series is just boring, uninspired.I'll tune-in to Season 2 to see if this show starts to feel like the G.I. Joe I grew to love but I won't be holding my breath."
4,Fun Golf Game,"I purchased this game soon after getting my iPaq, and it is now the most-used application on it. This game has gotten plenty of play at the airport. The physics are excellent and the controls are easy to learn, but mastering the game, (particularly with the power player), takes some effort. The only drawback is that the game closes itself out after you finish a round. You can download new courses from the developer as well."
5,Classic selections from a classic musician,"A great compilation featuring Tiny Grimes' classics such as ""Romance Without Finance"", ""Tiny's Tempo"" and ""Red Cross"" featuring the legendary Charlie Parker on alto sax. This cd also features Tiny's only national hit, ""Midnight Special"" which was recorded in 1948. The disc contains burnin' arrangements of Ellington's ""C Jam Blues"", Goodman/ Hampton's ""Flying Home"" and Arlen/Mercer's ""That Old Black Magic"". Released on the French ""Blues and Rhythm Series Classics"" label. If you need an introduction to the music of Tiny Grimes, I recommend this disc."
4,It does work,"Combined with eating half what you use to, these tabs work great I only been taking then for a month, and I have lost 15 pounds.and I also started walking more."
5,Excellent,Works great would recommend this product to anyone. It works fast and it works very well to curb the carbs.
2,Disappointed,I wish I could have examined this product before buying it. I surely would have bought one of higher quality.
5,Amazon has their information CONFUSED!,"Amazon has mistakenly listed the stars of ""Seabiscuit the Lost Documentary"" as Jeff Bridges & Chris Cooper and the director as Gary Ross. This is incorrect. ""Seabiscuit the Lost Documentary"" is the ORIGINAL Seabiscuit film from 1939 which was made by Charles Howard himself, and stars Charles and his wife Marcella. And also the REAL Seabiscuit is in it. Don't let Amazon's incorrect information stop you from buying this special piece of horseracing history."
5,A Rare Look at the Real Seabiscuit,"This is a wonderful documentary! As a huge Seabiscuit fan, I found it fascinating to be able to see the real Charles and Marcela Howard, Tom Smith, Seabiscuit and the rest of the gang that I have become so intrigued with. After reading Laura Hillenbrand's book, I very much wanted to see the characters in real life. Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire were good actors, but with this film, I finally got my chance to meet Charles Howard himself. It was like going back in time and getting a rare glimpse at what it was like to be on Ridgewood Ranch and a part of Seabiscuit's life. I really enjoyed this exciting trip back into horseracing history. Thank you Charles Howard for leaving us this great film legacy."
3,"Not as good as PBS or ""Seabiscuit - The Lost Documentary""","This documentary is fair. Not bad, not great. It needs more vintage footage. They mostly just pan across old photos. For more vintage footage, PBS is good, and even better is the new ""Seabiscuit - The Lost Documentary"". That is a real vintage documentary of Seabiscuit actually made in 1939 by Charles Howard himself after Seabiscuit won Horse of the Year. Either of these are better choices than this one. But if you love the Biscuit, why not get them all!!"
3,Seabiscuit DVD,"I would have rated this DVD higher but I found it disappointing that the great match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral is not covered in greater depth. You do not get to hear that race being called in its entirety. It is nice to see some of the people who were around when Seabiscuit raced and get their comments, but the whole production seems rather disjointed to me. I would recommend the PBS documentary over this one, but together they would make a nice combination."
4,Good - but...,This is a very interesting video. It is part actual documentary footage of Seabiscuit and part docu-drama. It is listed as having a running time of approx 60 minutes. This is somewhat inaccurate. The actual footage is only about 27 minutes. It is played first in the colorized version and then again in the original black and white which makes the total running time about 54 minutes but there is really only 27 minutes of material covered.
5,A place in history,"Very nicely done, explains WHY this horse uplifted all of America! Watch this, then watch the movie, if you are so inclined."
2,Poor,"Some facts about the Biscuit and some scraps of original footage are crammed into the DVD with very predictable--almost seemingly scripted--commentary by trainers, jockeys, and the like. DO NOT waste your time on this. The only good part of the film was the stock footage of racehorses added to fill it up, and even that wasn't spectacular. Get the 'American Experience' film. It is way more informative."
3,Should be for Kindergarten - 1st grade,"Previous reviews were correct for this workbook, and I should have purchased a different one. This is really not a graphing workbook, as you simply shade boxes in a row a certain color, instead of any kind of coordinates. I think it would be good for kindergarten or first grade at the highest. The book is cute though, just not what I was looking for."
5,Great Fun while LEARNING!!,My kids just love these books !! My son started bringing a few home from school & he really wanted to do more! I found these books online & bought them & now all my kids are having fun with them!
4,Self-esteem Revolutions in Children:understanding & Managing,"The book is divided into three main parts and goes into detail on why self-esteem is important. I felt this was information I already knew. However, the most helpful part of the book was the last section where it discussed how to manage your childs self-esteem."
2,"Looks great, some drawbacks","First-Looks great looking into the car with the matching seat covers. But-fabric is sewn to the thick rubber cover and therefore is not going to wash easily, already was slightly yellowed when it arrived and will dirty quickly. We'd purchased another Allison set and that wheel cover was all fabric which can be easily removed and thrown in the washer. I probably didn't read this description closely enough. Difficult to put on the steering wheel and tore about 2 inches while trying to put it on. Smells strongly of plastic or rubber and makes your hands smell. Shipping was excessive-almost as much as the item cost. I guess I'm spoiled from using Amazon's free super saver shipping so often-which was not available on this item."
3,Not a Fleece,We were somewhat disappointed (and are considering returning) because this is a standard sweatshirt (though of perfectly fine quality) and not a fleece as indicated in the description. They may have sent us the wrong item but it does look identical to the image.
2,Interesting but flat,"Good concept, but rather flat in content. I wanted interesting stories of the people reviewed. Instead there were rather bland descriptions and cliche applications."
5,Perfect for what they are designed for,"The title says it all. This nozzle was designed to be strong and long lasting. It's made of all metal and is very sturdy. The spray is surprisingly long. I can spray far distances without dragging the hose all over the place. You can either spray in a steady stream or in varying degrees of radius' depending on how much you let go of the nozzle. One criticism that might come up is that this product does not know gentle or have varying types of flows, and that's just fine as that is not what it was designed to do. But if you learn a few techniques like giving some distance and or showering back and forth, and trying out different angles you'll find it does all that you'll need it to do."
4,Has Held Up Well Through 1 Season of Heavy Use,"Works well as advertised. Good pressure and much better at changing the flow style than the type with the ""flow setting dial"" on the nozzle. Feels like it will last for several seasons. Grip could be a little more comfortable in the hand. If I had to do over, I would have bought the same one, but with a rubberized grip."
4,Good,I kinda expected a little more but for the price i am not really complaining it gets the job done
5,"Great, sturdy product.",I was tired of plastic models that worked well for a while but then seemed to deteriorate in quality. I've only used this once since I got it but it seems to be solidly built and provides anywhere between a nice powerful stream and an airy spray.
5,old faithful,"This old faithful sprayer works better than any of the new stuff. They can come out with all kinds of new gadgets to put on your hose, but they always end up breaking and wont work. this one is almost in destructable."
4,GREAT -- JUST ONE FLAW,"If you check my reviews you'll see I've been on a quest for a decent sprayer gun/wand for years.Exhausted with that, I finally bought these because they weren't PLASTIC, and they look like thesprayer my grandparents used for 50 years.Voila - I am happy to report these (I got 2) work great.Only flaw: when I go to fill a bucket, etc. there is no ""medium"" strength - it's either a widemist or a super-cannon.Otherwise, terrific."
5,"good seller, good product","This is a great nozzle. I have used a lot of these over the years, but I can no longer find them in hardware stores, so I went to Amazon. It came from a company named Deerso. When UPS lost my package, Deerso was extremely responsive, even though it was not their mistake."
5,My wife likes it,My wife wanted to replace our hose end sprayer. There were a lot of choices. I chose this one because if was metal. It works great and she is happy.
2,pineapple plant,"I received the plant as ordered in a timely fashion, however, the delivery person left it outside in the weather where it stayed for hours until I got home from work. Needless to say when I opened the package the plant was in poor shape with many dead leaves. I reside in Michigan and you can clearly see the snow on the ground and feel the temp of 20 degrees."
4,Excellent little pineapple plant,"When this plant arrive I thought, oh no, it is not going to make it, but it surprisingly took off and is thriving. It now looks like a fully grown pineapple top in a pot and I am going to have to repot it to a larger pot. It is amazing to watch this plant grow almost daily with very little care. I would buy from this vendor again without hesitation."
1,Hmm not sure just yet,Got this plant and well.. the leaves look pale..which may be ok.. but its going to be a wait and see.I have grown pineapples before from tops and they are a lot greener..Frankly Im a little disappointed on this one but like I said before.. Its a wait and see if it recovers..
5,Very pleasedI,I received the book quickly and it was in great shape for a great price. Highly recommended!
1,B. Cornelius,"A choppy read with too many personal, empirical observations and too few research-based findings. The book has a very left-leaning tone. Pro-employee, anti-capitalist to a fault. I found a few of the examples to be inappropriate - for example the company literature describing the sizes and features of sex toys could have been deleted without compromising the message. Overall, a very disappointing book. There are many better resources out there. Check out Guerrilla Marketing by Levinson."
5,The best version,Love having this wonderful old tearjerker. This has always been my favorite version of the story. Margaret Sullavan is just perfect and so is Boyer.
3,These work for me!,"Hypnosis and subliminal CDs aren't for everyone, but they work for me. I'm a newspaper editor/reporter/photographer. I put the subliminal CD on when I'm writing or working and it really ""holds"" me. I try to listen to the hypnosis CD daily because I think that's the key -- repetition. I have A.D.D. and it's a constant struggle for me, but these seem to help. They are not for everyone, but then again, gingko biloba isn't for everyone either. It never worked for me, but it does for some people. I'd urge anyone with trouble focusing to give these a try, but that means USE them at least once daily, maybe twice, for a good four to six weeks before you judge."
5,Exactly as Described,"We needed a new one of these after a clip on the old air compressor broke, this one fit perfectly."
1,Iffy,"Buy this book only if you have never done web graphics before. While I thought it would be a comprehensive look at web graphic techniques using PSP, it is really just a basics how-to kind of book. PSP has so much to offer yet this book falls short."
3,Very helpful but overpriced,"For me, this was a very helpful book but was overpriced for the information in it. It does explain the layers system very well and, in a way, that made it worth it."
2,Not worth it!!!,This book is too expensive compares to the value of it. It tells you very basic tutorial that a lot of people already know. Don't waste your time and money to buy it.
2,Beginners Only - Mostly a Manual,I was disappointed in this book since I liked the first edition and was looking forward to in depth treatment of the new Paint Shop 5 features (great product). Not worth $45 especially when the first edition was $35 and had a CD-ROM with samples
1,Just a re-hash of the Manual.,"This book does nothing more than show you what can be found in the manuals that come with PSP. If you are looking for something that is a tips and tricks book, this is not it. Save your money and read the manual."
2,"If you are looking for a step-by-step guide, don't buy it.","This book is just an ad for the software ""paint shop pro"". If you want to know how to use this sofrware, you can give it a try; otherwise, I'll suggest that don't buy it."
2,This is the big mystery of what happened to Mary's Family?,"Anyone who has read a few of these mysteries knew that eventually King would get to the mystery that has haunted Russell since childhood: ""What happened to cause the car accident that killed her parents and brother?""Any reader of a mystery series knew that this ""death by auto accident"" angle had to play a role later on. The problem is, after delving through Chinatown, Feng shui, and investigation by San Francisco's favorite Dashiell Hammett, you end up sighing, ""Is this it??""To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The book is still competently written and has the interesting leads of Mary Russell and a human Sherlock Holmes to make this a decent time waster; however considering the quality of some of the other entries this really seems to be a series that is starting to run out of steam."
5,A return to form,"After the first three books in the Mary Russell series, I was dissappointed by the rather rambling digressions in ""The Moor"" and ""O, Jerusalem."" Russell's last outing, ""The Game"" was a step in the right direction again, but it still fell short of my expectations.It was definitely more than those lowered expectations that elevated ""Locked Rooms"" for this reader. The tight, character-driven plot made this a real page-turner, with a mystery that affected Russell in ways the reader wanted to see resolved.""Locked Rooms"" ranks right up there with the best in the series, and it will keep me coming back for more."
3,Just isn't working for me,"I purchased this book several weeks ago and still haven't completed it, which is unusual for a Laura King book. This book just isn't working for me and is leaving me with a big feeling of ""So what?"" The first quarter of the book would have been great as an essay on going home, but not as a part of a mystery/detective series. I'm sure I'll finish it, but not with the relish I've read Ms. King's other books. What I recommend it? No."
4,Laurie King - Locked Rooms,"Laurie King fans of Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes stories will like this book. Mysteries within mysteries as Mary visits San Francisco for the 1st time since leaving for England after her family's death. Great exploration of unlocking the secrets of your past, physical or mental."
5,Mary Russell's Past Revealed,"I have enjoyed all the Mary Russell novels, some more than others; but I enjoyed this one the most. It was great to finally learn about Mary's past. It was sweet to read of Holmes' concern for his wife. I think Ms. King has done a wonderful job with this series. I look forward to the next."
2,The tea gets weaker,"I have read all the Mary Russell novels and found the first to be a revelation that I recommended to friends. However, I am reminded of a comment I once encountered about the Alexander Dumas novels that followed The Three Musketeers. It was that they were like sucessive cups of tea made from one tea bag - flavorful but weaker and weaker. This one is getting pretty weak. Frankly this novel's introspective turn does it no favors. The balance between characterization and action is off and the exploration of character is just not very interesting. If you want to see this balance handled better in this genre, check the new Maisie Dobbs novels of Jaquline Winspear. If this is the first Mary Rusell novel you have encountered, go to The Beekeepers Apprentice, the first - still a good read !"
4,Loving every minute of it!,"I love these characters!Books by Laurie R. King are immediate purchases when I see them at the bookstore. This one was no exception. And it was thoroughly enjoyable. These are characters I want to know and live with. I devour these books in days and eagerly look forward to the next one or reread an older one now and then. The plots are well-crafted and interesting, and King always teaches me a little history while she's unraveling the mystery. I read a lot of mystery/thriller, and the only mystery author I've enjoyed as much or admired her writing as much was Kate Moss, who did not need the novelty of the legendary Sherlock Holmes to hook her readers. But I readily admit, I love getting bits more of the Holmes character I grew to love so much in Conan Doyle's stories - all of which I've read.Also recommended: THE DEVIL IN MUSIC, Kate Moss THE APOTHECARY ROSE, Candace Robb A COLD MIND, David Lindsey AMAZONIA, James Rollins AZTEC, Gary Jennings DOOMSDAY BOOK, Connie Willis"
4,Locked Rooms (Mary Russell Novels),"I ordered Locked Rooms because I liked Ms. King's The Beekeeper's Apprentice. This one was enjoyable also, though slightly less exciting."
3,"A good read, but not her best..........","I was hoping this novel would bring back some of the spark of the earlier novels, but it is so repetitive the story is longer than it needs to be. I was unable to even finish the prior three Mary Russell novels which bordered on travelogues and I became too impatient. After a while I just lost interest in the characters. I have hung in there because her earlier novels were so good, but this one was disappointing as well. Also, I know there is a vast age difference between Holmes and Russell, but their total lack of any physical contact is abnormal. I know I'll read the next novel, but I'll go to the library instead of buying it."
3,movie reviewer,"This was a movie I had never heard of but being Disney we always enjoy. This movie was o.k. but not the excitement or intrigue we were expecting. It isn't one we will watch again, probably give it away."
4,An Excellent Adventure,"A surprising release from Disney. Young Davie sets out to find a treasure left for him by his father. But he is pursued by the same men who killed his father and forced his father to hide the treasure in far away Florida. Accompanied by his friend Thad, he is befriended by three adults, Along the way he encounters numerous adventures and learns several lessons. More intense than a typical Disney film, it is still suitable for children ages 8 and up with adult supervision (only because there are some rather scary moments). Well written, well acted, a true Disney delight."
2,sigh..,"i was expecting so much more from this album after hearing silver screen shower scene..:-( ""happy hour"" and ""what does it feel like"" are the only other tracks on this record that are good.the rest of these tracks are eitherA.) boring as hell orB.) 'okay' tracks that have a lot of potential, but because of stupid lyrics (Madame Hollywood for example) or a lack of flow (namely Harlot), they are very mediocre, which is a shame, really.:-( what a waste of money."
2,Good but very dirty inside,I bought this book used & when I received it there were chocolate stains all over the inside it's so old it wasn't even worth the purchase!!!
5,Uber Timo!,"This is an album you'll keep on rotation for days. It has just got that perfect mix of catchy tracks, pumping beats and general slickness that comes with most of Timo's releases. Yeah, it is probably the most commercial release from Maas thus far. The popularity of the hit track ""First Day"" shows that. But it's with this commercialism that I think we're presented with some of his best work. He has obviously challenged himself since his last album (which was also very good) and to his credit he has utilised the time separating both albums well (e.g. reaching yet another higher level with his musical knowledge and ability). So, my conclusion is that any minimal techno or electro fan will like this album. It's good to listen to either wasted or straight and at any time of the day. Remember to change the CD in your player after a while though. Too much of one thing is never a good thing. Yeah, even Timo!"
2,meh...,"Not a big fan.1) The ""shine"" isn't very shiny - I wasn't looking for the ""wet"" look, just something dark & a bit glossy - which this wasn't.2) Be very careful when applying - getting this on the wheels creates way too much extra work in getting this black paint removed. Maybe I'm just not detailed enough to use this product, but for ease of use, it gets a 1 star.It's a fine product, just not one for me."
3,"They should call it, ""A-Few-Days-Black"".","Applied 3 heavy coats that lasted about 4-5 days. After 4-5 days, it looks like a regular dry tire.Also, if you decide to use this product, you shouldn't do it in your garage because one little drop of this stuff can stain your floors. Do it on the street."
1,Don't WASTE your MONEY!,"Followed directions.......cleaned tires, applied after they dried. Let application dry overnight.... Next day light rain, barely any puddles formed. Tires looked dull again!"
2,Terrible product,"Not what I was expecting. Looks great and shiny right after application, but quickly fades after it dries. Took at least a few applications to get a lasting effect. Bottom line, I think it does a decent job of making the tires look more black, but don't expect your tires to look new or shiny."
3,"Well, my wife loves it.",A purchase this album as a birthday gift for my wife and she loves it. Charlie Masso is a former member of the world famous Puerto Rican boys group Menudo. As far as I know it was his only solo album. I heard a couple of songs and they sound ok. Nothing incredible but nice.
5,Enypoing this music is INEVITABLE!,"Excelent! When Charlie Massó says the only instrument he plays are his vocal chords, I could not agree more. The songs itself also feel great. Aun me gustas tu, Inevitable, El dolor de amar, Las fases de la luna, Cuando el amor termina, Te me vas, Señorita por favor and the other songs included are now among my all-time favorite songs. Nobody could go wrong buying this CD, and I personally could not pass without. Way to go, Charlie!"
4,A big bolt of weird,"IMPACT is a spooky-dooky gothadelic masterpiece that uses Kris Langan's delicious voice to good advantage. Unfortunately, it's followed by an annoying lullaby-like fragment. COMFORTING THE LONELY is a typical multiple-fragment experimentalist track. There's a low-key passage (sung by Kris) that sounds a lot like another low-key passage in a Delgados tracks called IS THIS A PLAN. Kris puts herself thru a semi-hilarious psychodrama workout in SISTER. Here's what Stein Haukland said about FM RADIO: ""like a cross between [Pink] Floyd and Tori Amos, which is fairly unusual but remarkably effective"". A lot of these tracks feature a chunk-a-lunk guitar timbre that was popularized by The Kinks. But unlike The Kinks, Grand National Brands is unremittingly experimentalistic with nary a concession to conventional mainstream dittyism."
4,in some cases it works (As a reducer)...,"I am the lucky individual who move to a place that had different smells for different rooms or closets.I initially purchase one bag and used it and it worked in the kitchen with the musty mildew smell. So I bought 5 more and have been moving them around the house to see how effective they are.It didn't work in one closet. It removed one smell but then another smell appears and over powers the closet now. I think it may be dog urine, but I am not sure.I have also used damprid, but it didn't do any thing with other types of odors (just musty mildew)I would also say it didn't eliminate the odor just reduced it. I am still smell certain things, just a lot less.I like that it is an investment that you can keep reusing.Also, I found these at home depot for less then $6 for the bigger bag.The bags initially may be dusty or small rock parts may fall out. I found just opening them out doors and shaking them around worked to make the ready for house hold use."
2,useless items,these bags of volcanic material were susposed to suck up the odor in my legal grow room...it didn't cut any of the odor :/ ! so a waste of my good money
2,Could not make it work..had to sell it.,"I sold it to a guy and he was able to start it and make it work. I as a woman found myself pulling and pulling 50 times and could not get it to start. Then the pull cord broke and had to be replaced. I was not a happy camper. I bought an battery Yard Stick and while it's a pain to charge up the battery before use, I'm a much happy camper. For the little amount I do it works just great and I was able to buy replacement parts for it through their customer service dept."
1,Bent shaft- looks awful-- packaging terrible,"When the Gas Trimmer arrived the box was beat to death. The UPS person said it looked liked it had been thrown in the box. Sure enough it had. There wasn't any carboard around it to hold it in place and the shaft is mashed so badly... huge curve... looks ridiculous. The shaft is supposed to be curved slightly. Everyone that looked at it.. said they couldn't believe it is curved so badly. I wouldn't recommend buying from this company. We are going to try to get someone to straighten the shaft. In order to use it, you need to bend over toward the ground really close and try to angle it to cut the grass.Due to poor packing, it might have been better."
3,Own LOTR soundtrack? Then you own this one.,"Updated version of the LOTR soundtrack with some new sounds. Being a fan of Kronos Quartet, CLint Mansell, and the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack, I was excited about the prospect of hearing The Summer Overture receive a full orchestra treatment (the music for the siege of Helm's Deep in the second trailer). Unfortunately, they took the time to record it, but not add it to the soundtrack. What a loss."
4,trailer music,"I, too, was looking forward to this soundtrack after hearing the music from the trailers and tv spots. The song is a different version of a theme from the 'Requiem for a Dream' movie soundtrack. Too bad it's not included in the Two Towers soundtrack. Hopefully the trailer will be on the Two Towers dvd."
3,Not as good as Fellowship,"If you really enjoyed The Fellowship of the Rings, you're going to be disappointed. The tracks in The Two Towers are no where near as moving as Shore's previous effort. Buy it only if you're truely a dedicated Rings fan."
5,Another LOTR Masterpiece!,"In my opinion, this is an even better soundtrack than the first! They feature many different music artists. First of all, I love the Rohan theme! It's very pretty on the violin! Isabel Bayrakdarian has a beautiful voice. It gives me chills on ""Evenstar""! Shelia Chandra has another great voice! It captures the moment perfectly on ""Breath of Life""! Ben del Maestro has an excellent voice also! I just love ""Forth Eorlingas"" and ""Isengard Unleashed"" because of him! Emiliana Torrini has an interesting voice. At first I didn't really like it, but then I began to think that it's the perfect voice for ""Gollum's Song"". This is yet another LOTR and Howard Shore must buy! Happy Listening!"
4,Where's the song from the trailer??,"I bought this CD hoping the song from the trailer for The Two Towers would be on it and it's not!! The song I wanted is played towards the end of the preview. That's why I gave this CD 4 out of 5 stars. It's an excellent compilation; it's just missing the one piece I had most desired! If anyone knows where I can find it (besides downloading the trailer), please email me! WintreLJ1402@yahoo.com"
4,Nice blend between soothing...,Nice blend between soothing the spirit and reminding oneself of the action-packed moments of the movies.
3,"Half as good as Fellowship, lacks power and consistancy.","To put it short, this soundtrack probably doesn't even have 8 bars of consistant tunes. In fact, it gets annoying when you expect one good tune, and get nothing but long drawn out orchestra that doesn't have any consistancy.I admit it is good ""music"". But bad tunes and melody. Get what I am trying to say?John Williams would blow this thing right out the window as far as I am concerned.I hope the movie makes up for it. I am a very dissapointed fan of this soundtrack.Maybe they made it real bad, so that the next one will sound that much better? I hope.And the music in the trailers is abscent from the soundtrack. And apparently the movie. (which is bad news)I find the music in the trailers for TTT better than this entire soundtrack."
3,OPERA LOVER REJOICE!.........,"IF YOU LIKE OPERAS YOU WILL LIKE THIS SOUNDTRACK. HOWARD STONE IN AN INTERVIEW ON THE EXTENDED DVD SAID..,""THIS SCORE IS LIKE WRITTING AN OPERA."" HE IS DOING JUST THAT.I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN, JACKSON SHOULD HAVE USED THE TALENTS OF DAVID ARKENSTONE FOR THE SOUNDTRACK. IF NOT DAVID THEN CERTAINLY JOHN WILLIAMS.COMPRARE ""MUSIC INSPIRED BY MIDDLE EARTH"" TO THESE SOUNDTRACKS AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. ALSO COMPARE THE SOUNDTRACKS OF THE ""HARRY POTTER"" MOVIES OF JOHN WILLIAMS AND SEE THE WAY MR. WILLIAMS ""BLENDS THE MUSIC"" TO THE MOVIE NOTBOMBARDS YOU WITH IT.TO ME IT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN, EVEN THOUGH THESOFTER THEMES WERE VERY GOOD."
3,Deceptive,The soundtrack is great but I honestly bought it to hear the music they play along with the movie trailer. It's not on this CD!
3,Not very good,"An overrated soundtrack. I didn't care much for the Fellowship or the Return of the King, but the Two Towers is the worst of the bunch. I suppose fans of the movie will appreciate this CD, but it's just not a very good soundtrack. Boring, tenuous vocals, cliched, blah, blah. For those interested in really good soundtracks, go pick up a copy of Ennio Morricone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, Bernard Hermann's VERTIGO, or ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS...SIGNATURES IN SUSPENSE."
3,OPERA LOVERS REJOICE!.................,"HOWARD STONE IN AN INTERVIEW ON THE EXTENDED DVD SAYS..""THIS SCORE IS LIKE WRITING AN OPERA."" WELL HE IS DOING JUST THAT. IF YOU LIKE OPERA YOU WILL LIKE THIS SOUNDTRACK.I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN, I WISH PETER JACKSON HAD USED THE TALENTS OF DAVID ARKENSTONE FOR THIS SOUNDTRACK. IF NOT DAVID THEN JOHN WILLIAMS. JUST COMPARE THE SOUNDTRACKS OF THESE TWO MOVIES (THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING AND THE TWO TOWERS) WITH THE SOUNDTRACKS OF BOTH ""HARRY POTTER"" MOVIES. EVEN THOUGH THE SCORE FOR THE ""RING"" MOVIES IS MUCH MORE CLASSICAL IT IS MUCH TOO OPERA FOR THIS MUSIC LOVER.JOHN WILLIAMS BRINGS MUCH MORE ""RICHNESS"" TO A SOUNDTRACK AND MAKES IT SEEM MORE A PART OF THE MOVIE THAN DOES HOWARD STONE."
3,Pales in comparison to Fellowship soundtrack,"Perhaps my expectations were too high after the Fellowship soundtrack, but the Two Towers soundtrack fails to generate the same emotion. I listen to Fellowship several times a week, and it still causes a lump in my throat. I was REALLY looking forward to the Two Towers soundtrack, but it mostly leaves me cold.Don't get me wrong, the music works for the movie, but by itself it just doesn't capture the imagination."
2,"Great Music, Annoying Presentation","Orchestral music enthusiasts who enjoy cinematic scores will, predictably, enjoy Howard Shore's composition for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and the other scores in this series as well. Of the three CDs, The Two Towers does I think show us the greatest range of Shore's thematic elements used in the eponymous movies. This CD is comprised of music incidental to scenes set in Rohan, Fangorn's Forest, and the approaches to Mordor, but it is the Meduseld/Theoden themes that ""stay with you"" well after the soundtrack ends.The CD does, however, have a major presentation flaw. When played in a computer, there is an autostart web-link that impedes listening. You have to work around the web link in order to merely play the music. The link is nothing other than a garden variety in your face advertisement, and a solicitiation to join their website and otherwise provide them with information that will presumedly be used as an excuse to annoy you with MORE advertising."
5,"Howard Shore - Istari, or just plain genious?","Sometimes I really question Howard Shore's composing - how can anything this good come from the hands of Man? The music is inspiring and takes you on a roller coaster of emotions, from calm and serene, to tense, to sad, all in one song. These compositions truly touch something deep. I really recommend it!"
5,Wonderfully beautiful moving,"This is beautiful music. But you should be able to listen to it as it's meant to be listened to. Unfortunately, I work in a small cubicle area and share an office with hip-hop, country, and christian music fans. They are great people and we respect each other's spaces by playing our personal music preferences so as not to disturb each other. I live less than 3 miles from where I work, so I don't get to listen much in the car either. I would love to take a long road trip and play the CD's in my car. In the meantime, I play them at home and find myself recalling the movie scenes in which the music played."
4,A suitable follow on to LOTR TFOTR,"Although the first album was simply stunning with the wonderful vocals of Enya and the simplistic flute, this album was a suitable follow on. If you really want to get the true sense of Howard Shore's masterpiece, listen to both albums back to back and back again."
5,A well done soundtrack,"I often find it difficult to apprecaite a soundtrack on its own because listening to the soundtrack conjures up the movie, making it tough to listen to on its own. That being said, this is still a superb soundtrack.My favorite piece would be ""Foundations of Stone,"" the music playing as Gandalf and the Balrog are fighting. Its especially brilliant in the way it changes time from a brisk 4/4 to a broader 3/4 as the two fall our of the cliff and down towards a massive underground lake. This is not a soundtrack to be passed upon."
5,Awesome movie music,"This is a rare case where the music may be better than the movie, though I loved the movie too! The music inspires thoughtful memories and moods I have associated with 2003, when the movie came out. Truly a classic!"
5,Another stunning release!,"Polystar company does it again by releasing this another great techno trance compilation. Filled with new and awesome traxx worth paying the money for. Good selection of traxx on this compilation better than the current Dream Dance CD. If you are looking for superb trance and progressive traxx this is one compilation you do not want to miss. It has awesome traxx by such artists as Moby (Ferry Corsten rmx), Sash!, Paul Van Dyk, Mythos N DJ Cosmo, Storm, Ayla, Vengaboys (Airscape rmx), DJ Tiesto, Kay Cee, Beam & Yanou, Pulp Victim, and many others that I can't think of right now. Once again superb selection of traxx worth listening where ever you are. Uplifting and dreamy as well as hard hitting dancefloor fillers (e.g.: Iguana by Mauro Picotto). Buy it now. I wish I could be a DJ or producer like these artists and would like to play in big clubs and gigs all over Europe."
4,Todd Rundgren Japanese Singles Collection!,"So much better than the Domestically available Collections of Todd. 38 songs encased in a nice, easy to deal with package. Lyrics (in English) are included. Been a great fan of his for a while, even though my sister took my copies of his records way back in the early eighties, great for the casual fan as well a seasoned Todd Fan. The Japanese seem to package Todd the Best, so spend a bit more and get what you pay for!"
1,Independent punk review,"I ordered this DVD-Audio release because I liked the songs and I thought it would be nice to give my ears something decent to listen to. How big was my disappointment. The tracks are only available in 5.1, with the possibility of stereo downmix (the downmix weights and phases are suppiled on DVD). That's not too bad in itself, but the weights are set incorrectly, causing some distortion. The sound of this album is washed out, muffled, as if I were listening to the music playing from a telephone. Youtube videos have better quality sound. Hell, I bet even ringtones will have better quality. That's not why DVD-Audio is here, is it? Just avoid this one and save your buck ..."
1,retarded,"Are the record executives at RCA truly this shallow? Apparently so. The characterisitic fantasy and dremalike qulaity of Chopin's nocturnes and preludes should nto be misconstrued as porn music. This album shamelessly compromises Chopin's reputation in an effort to gain market share. What's worst of all, the recordings are second rate at best."
4,Blissfully Good,"As a writer it is a pleasure to have someone read your stories and receive some type of emotions from them. This book is a story that was enjoyable, right to the point of the telling and a writer who is now on my favarite author's list. Great story about believeable characters. Word of mouth whether it's about a book, movie or music,is how you know it's a good book etc.Yo don't sleep on this book or this author she was readable."
2,Not about music,"Bliss is a run-of-the-mill story of an African-American girl abused and mistreated by family and friends. She grows up to be a world-famous concert violinist, but there's almost nothing about her training, the musical process, the pieces she plays, her experiences at Juillard. She is merely described as playing ""like an angel."" If you want a typical story about a poor girl who makes good, read it. If you want anything about the musical experience, read something else. I doubt the author has much musical background."
5,Amazing Read!,I was astounded to find that this was the authors' first novel. This was a definite page turner that kept me wanting more. I can not wait to read the next book by Gabrielle Pina. Congratulations on a beautiful story and I hope there will be many more to come!
1,No supporting evidence whatsoever,"This book provides no evidence to support the thousands of claims it makes. I looked in vain for any scientific support. In particular, I took two diseases with which I am familiar and found this book to offer complete hogwash. Under Crohn's disease, there are numerous claims made about herbal ""cures"" but not one of them has any empirical basis for the claim (except hearsay?). I can't recommend this or Tenney's other book to anyone who is looking for valid justification for remedy."
5,essential!,"I've collected a small library of herb books over the years, and this is by far the one I reach for the most."
2,The Best????...,"Well,this collection of Willie Colon's songs doesnt entirely prove Willie Colon's awesome influence of Salsa in the 1970s;where Willie Colon was at his best with great album releases such as""Asalto Navideno"",""El Jucio"",""Lo Mato"",and much more.These songs featured in this album are way too revised and sorta dilutes Salsa into Latin Pop,especially with""El Gran Varon.""Its origional version is much better.If you're really looking for""The Best""of Willie Colon,you should refer to his album title releases in the 1970s.Those are the true Salsa and Latin Jazz records to hear from Willie Colon."
4,This CD captures some of the classics from Willie,"I remember listening to Willie and his band in the 70's. This Cd has some great tunes that really capture the esscence of the Willie Colon-sound and type of salsa. The best tune: Idilio (from the ""Hecho in PR"" album. My second: Aerolinea Desamor."
5,This is by Mark O'Connor the sax player...,...not Mark O'Connor the violin player.See info here:http://www.blujazz.com/bio_OConnor.html
5,Indispensible travel camera,"I've used variations of this camera for 20 years. If you are willing to make a few simple manual settings you will be rewarded with truly sensational photos. The 2.8 lens is far superior (and faster) than any of the pocket all-auto zoom cameras. Once or twice when my Nikon failed, I finished a professional shoot with the Minox. Nobody could tell the difference in the final prints.If you really want to travel light, skip the flash and learn to use the backlight compensation. This will work for many underlit situations but not at night."
2,Not comprehensive enough...,"The essence of every encyclopedia is to cover the largest number of topics (entries) pertinent to the field in study. Although Housing is a vast term and can encompass many things, this book has clearly missed a huge number. If my memory serves me right there is no mention about neighborhood concept, very little on new urbanism, nothing on smart growth, ecological villages and sustainable communities...there is much more missing, this is only a part. As I said it is tough to include all, but take a note of the upcoming Encyclopedia of the City from Routledge (editor Professor Roger Caves from San Diego) and you will see what an encyclopedia means. This book needs a 2nd heavily revised edition. I don't envy the editors at all, it is a horrible task to do something like this."
1,missed the boat,"i sort of liked his other cd's, but this one is just a big mess. with no real direction or theme, most of this sounds like an attempt at (bad) pop music with some exotic sitars and table drums thrown on top. not to mention the onslaught of annoying vocal gymnastics throughout. none of the music here is engaging in the least (which is why there are so many cheap used copies available here). very disappointing"
2,Not for me,"I have loved Karsh's previous releases, but I did not enjoy Broken English as much as I expected to. Karsh has always had a unique style and although it is great that he experimented and changed his style since every artist should, I felt like something was lost in the translation. It is original and he achieves a multi cultural sound by blending hip hop, rock, electronica, and asian influences, but overall, I found the album to be flat. There are a few good tracks, but as hard as I tried, I just couldn't get into it and found myself bored. This album sounds too ""pop"" and commercial for me, but aside from that, it just didn't hold my intrest. I think a lot of people will like this album, but I have a feeling that many people, like me, will be left unsatisfied and move on to a different CD to listen to."
5,Inspirational!,"Broken English is such an inspirational compilation. I find it more cohesive than Kale's previous ""Liberation"" although I personally prefer the beats of Liberation for kickin it or a running mix.Highly recommend getting both CDs and put the mix on Random. I have kept these two CDs in my car the last month and can't get enough! The beats and grooves work first thing in the morning, or while stuck in the traffic gridlock on the way home -- I catch other drivers smiling at me moving with the beat in bumper-to-bumper."
5,EXCELLENT,"I wanted to do well on the PSAT test, and I bought a review book from literally all the main companies. I have the princeton review, REA, barrons, kaplan, you name it. I would least recommend the princeton review, because it is way too general and brief as always. (it is bad for AP review also) Anyways, I ended up running out of time, so I only used the McGraw Hill prep book.I know this book is good because I compared it to all the other prep books. It has all the concept reviews plus SIX very good practice tests. This book is a MUST HAVE!!"
3,Too Many Errors,"I like the organization. The mathematics section was nicely done, giving a well organized overview of PSAT math; however, I must ding the book because we found 5 errors in the answer sections for two math worksheets. Sloppy, sloppy."
4,This Album,"This is a good band, but I would have prefer to buy their other album ""Killing Helenski"", but this is still a good album. If you like Tristania then you will like this band guaranteed."
5,The last album with Juancho Rois.,"One of the best albums of Diomedes Diaz Maestre, ""El Cacique"". In this 1994 recording, the union between Diomedes and Juancho gets to the top. The singer and the acordeon player show their virtue. ""La Plata"" (The Money) is already a clasic in the Vallenato music. Great performance of Juancho Rois, with his usual ""pase"" that keep him from winning the Rey Vallenato Prize.This is without any doubt the best of the last 7 albums released by diomedes."
2,Kind of nice...,"This is a Fantasy Game made into a comic. You have the Hero, the Bad Guys, the levels and secondary characters. There is a touch of humor, but most of it just didn't DO anything for me. The plot, like many a game I have played online, didn't go anywhere and it didn't go anywhere very, very SLOWLY. Frankly, Megatokyo or Misfile kept me interested til the last page and I am waiting for more volumes to come out so I can spend my cash on them. Those artists need to be supported.RPG World was like eating bland oatmeal. I had to remember to come back to it again and again to finally finish it off. And I am NOT waiting for the next volume. I DO not plan to spend my cash on any more of these discs. It just didn't click for me."
3,"Cheap Chinese, better than none.","Breaking and short useful life span are 'chronic and manageable' issues, the planned obsolescence ca$h cow of the producers. Where are the 20+ year German or Swedish blades of the past? On my saws, I got these for spares."
2,Pedestrian,Nothing original. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I imagine if you've had a 6-pack and there's a cute girl in the room the music would be okay.
5,Hooked on the Wild Side,"Painting with wool is an amazing art. The artist who authored ""Hooked on the Wild Side: Everything You Need to Know to Hook Realistic Animals"" takes you on a tour of animal expressions and the art of rug hooking. Memories in the making--always. Our first grandson will reap the benefits of all that I learn. Donna Stone"
4,Life,I read this book in about 4 days. I must say that it is real life. About a young man trying to figure out is sexuality. ladies this book is an eye opener to make u think 2wice about that man you are laying next 2. I recommend this book. Its worth your money.
3,BLOWS MORE THAN YOUR MIND,"Good story but has awful editing, proofing and really contradicting statements.The back cover advertises it's a true story yet the inside claims its all fiction. Having experienced a few 'thugs' in my life, I am inclined to believe it's 50/50.I found the author's blaming an honest and out ""[...]"" for the 'serious issue' facing the closet-queen character rather BLATANTLY homophobic and a public display of ignorance. Given the fact that the main character engages in unprotected sex with umpteen individuals (of both sexes) afterwards, anyone could have been the cause. Moreover, when the edjumificated, ""college-degree-holding"" closet-queen eventually learns of the [...]demise, he is relieved to know it was merely due to pneumonia and not the ""Big One"". (Wow!)NO Pulitzer for this one, I'm afraid. As a B-grade homoerotic novel, it makes handy reading in the John - keeping you on the edge of the ""seat"". :-)"
2,FIRE THE EDITOR,"This book have a great story line, but because it was poorly edited it made the book hard to read. The Publishing House should Fire the editor."
1,You call this edited?,This book is a disgrace and the editor should get out of the publishing business. Going back to school would be a good idea.
3,Very Scary,"Reading this book makes you look at every single guy different because you never ever know what is going on!!!The author was very graphic in detail, a little too much for me. It makes you wonder, it says this is a true story but im not sure. This man goes to jail and gets turned way out, then he goes crazy. I read the book in one day that's how crazy it was. Why would the author name ""Gangsta Unit""??? Is the author trying to tell us something? Not a simple coincidence!! After I read that part I also put the book down, I was afraid!!! There were many errors in the book which was so unprofessional. The ending was different... Last but not least!! Ladies please please use protection and investigate your male partner you never know what else he may do!!! It could mean your life, literally!!"
2,"Hot Title, Lackluster Read!","I purchased the book after hearing so much about it on the Wendy Williams show. I was like a little kid waiting for the mailman to show up so I could read this book. Once I finally got it I was totally disappointed. The setting was typical and the scenario was basic. To top it off the ending was just so-so. There was nothing that made me say DAMN, DAMN, DAMN....I do not advise this book unless u just need something to read."
2,my thoughts about homo thug,"I do think that the book was very detail about the inside.On the other hand i have to agree with some of the other reviews about, the misspelled words and how the book went. The book was in some parts not understanding and he went from telling one thing to talking about something else, and the end of the book didn't make much sense either."
2,Every Thug needs a....FELLA?,"I'm sooo glad I found this book at a bookstore on clearance for $3.99!It was worth just that.Seriously going to jail/prison at 16 and a virgin?Come on you knew he was going to hook up with a dude sooner or later!!!Of course he wasn't gay or Bi just a lil horny-yeah right!He claimed he didn't like to see it happen to guys while he was in ""kiddie"" jail but a few years in prison and he gets tired of ""Sally and her 4 sisters"" and says f*%# IT!Not only does he try it but he falls in love and...well don't let me spoil it for you Buy it if you wish don't say I didn't warn you!!!"
1,It wasn't that bad...but it does need editing!,"I understand the frustration at the lack of editing, but in all fairness the brother put it down. A lot of truth was in this book. The writer wrote in a voice that was conversational, so it put you at ease listening to him speak. Still, the story really does need editing. The publisher put this out there raw dog style. It was confusing to read with the way paragraphs went on for pages and pages. Not to mention the misspelled words."
2,Can't believe it was published!!,"Although this book was a great read for the john (as another reviewer stated). The grammatical and contradicting errors were just too much. Even the authors name was misspelled on the cover. I still don't know if his last name is Kaharo or Kahari. The front cover said Kaharo. And furthermore ... who is this mysterious ""Gangster Unit"" (the coincidence was too obvious). I'm just too through with this book, I'm suprised they published it with the mistakes and illogical things going on. If you just want something to read in the john, this is good. It actually took me about a day to read it, I'm not sure if it was the story, or the fact that I just couldn't believe this made it past the writer's desk and I wanted to see what crazy shii might happen next."
5,Wow!!! Are you serious? 50 cent and G Unit on the downlow,"This book was very graphic.But What had me going back and re-reading was the story about Half a dollar( that was shot 9 times in the mouth), and all the other coincidences to theG Unit clan. The author says thi is a true story, on the back cover. This has to be referring to 50cent. In no way would 50cent not be sueing by now. OMG! Remember when they said Lloyd Banks looks like some Homo porno star? Makes you go hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!"
1,I agree!,"I was led to the publisher's web-site by an associate. I saw this book being advertised and I thought the concept was intriguing. I saw a street vendor selling it I asked and he recommended it. I read it. I repeat: I read it. First and foremost I would like to say to the author, get a lawyer and sue the publisher. The web-site lists Denise Campbell as the Executive Editor. If this is the same Denise Campbell that also writes for the same publisher we're talking serious conflict of interest here! Not even Triple Crown is this bad when it comes to editing!I was considering sending a manuscript in to the the publisher to be reviewed, but this just killed that idea!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Sterling silver stick drops are flimsy and bent out of shape immediately. I know they were inexpensive, but really...."
2,boring and outdated,Not very happy with book. Facts out of date and put me to sleep. Only positive thing is the fact that it is hard to find comprehensive histories of time period in one volume.
4,Best affordable introductory Japanese History,"Pretty much every English speaker who studies Japan acquires a copy of Sansom. Consequently, if you are interested in Japan, you probably already have a set. I am giving this collection four stars instead of five simply because its scholarship is now a bit dated and it is not the Cambridge History of Japan. But, who can afford the Cambridge History? I wish I could. In terms of being affordable, this is most likely still the best introduction to Japanese history around in English."
5,Excellent CD,I enjoyed their music in the concert given in my hometown Thessaloniki last autumn. Great rock music recommended for everybody looking for a sweet touch of the soul!
5,Impressed,"Maybe we don't know many things about the music scene in Norway. Well know we have to look better. Espesially after this excellent album.Dark, but so bright and inspired.In GREECE we love it."
5,So far they work...,"I have fibroids and I wanted to be rid of the periodic spotting. I tried these, following the instructions to the letter, and so far the results are good. No spotting in almost a month. I'm pleased with the results."
4,Good Product,I didn't realize how much this product helped the bloating and inflammation until I stopped using them. I will begin taking this supplement again for an enlarged uterus and fibroids.
5,Mediterranea Raises The Bar,"Johannes Linsteads new album is fantastic. Every song is rich, melodious, and creates a great sense of freshness and JOY. You'll love every performance the sounds are clean, clear and exhilarating."
4,flamenco guitar,Fine instrumentalist with a flair for playing noveau guitar music. He keeps getting better with each album.
4,Dark Shadows: Fan Favorites,"When I was in the 4th grade, Dark Shadows was my all-time favorite after school show. I would rush home, grab a snack and curl up to watch all the thrilling events that would befall the residents of Collinsport! Barnabas was my favorite villian/hero, able to win your heart and frighten you at the same time. Angelique, Quentin and so many memorable characters came out of Dark Shadows. They grew on us and we wanted to know more about who they were and who they were becoming as the show continued to air till 1971. I highly recommend checking out Dark Shadows. Yes, there are the occasional bloopers here and there but, it was filmed live, so mistakes were bound to happen. Just look past that and get into the characters and see what the folks of Collinsport have to offer you!"
5,The best show ever in the history of television!,"I bought this on another site, having been a fan of the series for quite awhile. This is the best way to become familiar with what Dark Shadows really is after that travesty of a motion picture! This collection offers up some of the best bits of Dark Shadows history. I am so glad that we are finally able to see the best of Gothic Daytime on dvd! Thanks, MPI!"
2,Not worth it.,"There were many more episodes, in my opinion, better than these with the exception of Barnabas introducing himself to Elizabeth, which was indeed pivotal. The other choices had me trying to remember, ""What the heck happened next?"" I find the format very jarring, and the commentary was not that good, either. Save your money people, and buy the DVD sets of the episodes."
2,Disappointed,I'm sorry to say being a long time DS viewrer I was very disappointed in the selections chosen for this Fan Favorites video! I could name at least 10 other episodes that would have been more interesting! I cannot recommend this!
3,Wow!,"I cannot believe I actually ran home from school to watch this! Of course, back then, is was all about being like a vampire."
5,Happy Mama,I bought this DVD for my Dad for Christmas cause he used to love watching the shows that are on this dvd when they were a T.V series also when he was a kid. I was so happy to see him open it on christmas and have that look of excitement as he once did way back when. Thank you Amazon for having such a great variety of things I thought id never see again in this life time. Very happy as always :-)
3,This is Not Nightclub Two Step,"If you are looking for a DVD to teach you the Nightclub Two Step, this is not it. Keep looking! This DVD teaches the country version of Two Step and it is totally different."
5,most excellent,"this is an excellent intro to music i had neglected. a wonderful little stepping stone,"
1,Shrunk,Only one wear out of this shirt. After one wash this shirt became a belly shirt. I now have around the house rags.
4,Lament for Four Virgins,"This was an interesting book that was was quite enjoyable once I became with reacquainted with the antiquated style. One thing to take note of is that given the era in which it was written as well as the era it was written, this is a very politically incorrect book. If easily offended you might want to avoid.The fictional town of Andalusia is based on Brunswick, GA and the characters are supposedly many of the families in the city. I am told natives can tell me who the characters are in real life. The locations leave little to the imagination that it is Brunswick.The author also has another book based loosely on Saint Simons Island entitled ""Unbidden Guests."" The author led quite a life and you can Google her name and find out more about her."
4,Badass,"this album hits hard from the beginning, but changes it up like crazy.uri caine is a musician very much in tune with what is happening in the music world, therefore the d n' b tracks sound like something squarepusher would have programmed, the hip hop tunes groove extremely hard, etc. this guy knows what's up!!perhaps it is musician's music, for better or for worse"
5,Buy it before you buy a car,"I am grateful a friend of mine recommended this book to me before I bought my new XTerra. Whew, it's thorough and gives you good ammunition before you go into battle with a car dealer.BUY IT!You can thank me later.Joey"
1,"If you need this book, your problem is bigger than you think","A teacher assigned this book in a research methods class I took this semester, and I seriously can't recall a single more waste-of-time reading assignment. I really didn't take anything away from this that I didn't already know and the ridiculous stories meant to teach a lesson were just insulting. This simplistic, reductionist ""textbook"" should never have been assigned in a graduate level research class. The only thing I got out of it were a few laughs with my friends over the sheer idiocy of it all."
5,Best introduction to problem identification available.,Deceptively simple and effortless to read with an enormous payback! Simply the best book on problem definition. Forces you to think about what the problem is before you decide to tackle it. Should be read often. Promotes common sense.
4,"Here's lean thinking, from 30 years ago.","This book provides a wealth of advise in a comical novelization. You can look at the table of contents and grasp what it is about, yet the detail is fun and illustrative.Some of the techniques, such as asking ""why"" are the basis of lean. The chapter about the nails is an example of poka-yoke. It explains why people get confused in a style that seems taken out of ""Crucial Conversations"". And yet, its descriptions are Dilbert-esque.It would get 4.5 start if possible, but it gets only to four, because it is also too light a reading."
2,See the forest not the trees,"If you understand the title of this review, then you don't need to read the book. The book is organized around chasing one silly solution after another to a problem that is finally solved by saying someone else should have fixed it in the first place. The implication being that had you been smart enough to make a phone call to the repair man, lots of grief would have been saved.Very simplistic and certainly not worth my time or money."
3,Amusing but not helpful,This is a good book for someone in a Problem 101 class. I was hoping that it would help me with some realtime problems.
1,Polya meets Dr Seuss,"Pass on this book.If you do buy it you'll read through it in no time and will be no better at problem solving. Mostly common sense.Without the chatty style and illustrations this book could have been reduced to a thin pamphlet.If you really need a good problem solving text and are mathematically oriented opt for the classic ""How to Solve It"" by Polya or ""How to solve mathematical problems"" by Wayne Wickelgren. Not the easiest reading but definitely more worthwhile."
4,"Spend time observing, thinking - then - acting if useful...","Similar to two consulting books written by Weinberg, this Gause/Weinberg work ...a) is straight upb) doesn't waste my time with frillsc) illustrates ideas through storiesd) overloads you with many useful themes immediately applicableThis book presents basic life problems encountered by many .. shows two opposing views into the scenario, and helps the reader see the various ways to observe, approach, solve (with repercussions to consider) and learn from along the way.Put it in the portfolio with other Weinberg books and you begin to formulate a thoughtful, customer focused service worldview. Worth the time.!."
2,Lot of hype but no direct guidance,"I bought this book on the recommend of a colleague. Wish I hadn't. The book spends a lot of ink in setting-up a scenario and then providing convaluted responses/solutions without actually giving direct, meaningful guidance. I know I may be 'spooned' by others who might say I don't get it... but that's exactly my point... the book is supposed to supply the answer to why my lights might not be on!!!"
